    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: PrologueIt\u2019s about time I accepted it. I'm screwed.\u201cYou will no longer be recognized as a member of the Rothstaylor family due to your crimes. For inappropriately swearing in front of the honorable Princes Penia, for illegally intervening with the Holy Silvenia Academy\u2019s entrance exam due to being blinded by your jealousy, and lastly, for neglecting your classes\u2014these crimes have tarnished the family\u2019s name and cannot be taken lightly.\u201dThere was no reason to read the rest.The letter was from the head of the house, Krepin Rothstaylor. It\u2019s filled with needless formalities but in the end, the summary was as follows:\u201cYou will be disowned by the family.\u201dThe life of living like a king with the support of a powerful family was over.It felt like the God of Fate was mocking me.Was he having fun laughing at my misfortunes? When my life had just become a living hell?The letter\u2019s words lingered, stuck in my head.I wanted to respond to the unfair mocking words.Why?Because the Ed Rothstaylor that used the family name as a shield to live an arrogant life\u2026 was not me.\u201cI gathered all your belongings here. Thank you for your hard work.\u201dThe maid who worked at Ophelis Hall, the finest dormitory at Silvenia Academy, politely gave her greetings.With a blank face, I received two large wooden suitcases from her.Even though my room was so luxurious, all my belongings surprisingly fit within these two bags.After the support from my family was cut off, this was all I had.In other words, the luxuries within that room were never mine to begin with.\u201cI hope you live the rest of your life well.\u201dEven though my life was essentially now in the gutter, I still received honorable treatment as a former noble. But although I was treated with respect, it ultimately felt like adding salt to injury.Slam!The Ophelis Hall\u2019s large door swung shut, leaving me all alone in its beautiful garden.Ahh\u2026 I thought it was about time I came to terms with it.\u201cI\u2026 actually entered the game. I can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201dAt the worst possible time, I became the worst possible person in my favorite game. A game of which I was the only fan.\u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019I lowered my bags and swiped both hands over my face.I\u2019m fucked.I didn\u2019t know what to do.* * *\u2018Ed Rothstaylor\u2019 was a name I was not too comfortable having.\u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 had a total of 43 episodes. I played the game over five times, but it was still a name I barely remembered. The reason was obvious.It\u2019s because Ed Rothstaylor was a third-class villain that left the moment he showed up.- \u2018Hey, look over there. Isn\u2019t that Ed Rothstaylor?\u2019- \u2018Shit! Don\u2019t look! He\u2019ll notice!\u2019- \u2018Do we even have to worry anymore? Wasn\u2019t he already expelled?\u2019- \u2018I heard from a friend at Ophelis Hall yesterday that they even kicked him out of his room. I guess we won\u2019t be seeing him next semester then.\u2019- \u2018It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? Just like how we don\u2019t know how high the sky is, there really is no way to know what could happen to someone\u2019s life.\u2019- \u2018Why did he even use such a trick at the entrance exam?!\u2019- \u2018I knew he was like this from the beginning! Even without skills, he always kept showing off!\u2019As soon as lunchtime came around, the students began to gather at the student center. After putting down my large wooden bags beside me and covering my face, my ears itched at the whispers.A person\u2019s rise and fall was perfect fodder for gossip. But even though I understood that fact, I can\u2019t help but feel it was unfair.Before I became this character, I was someone who lived frugally and honestly, working hard without ambition.So wasn't it a bit too much to treat someone like me like a criminal?\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dI wanted to smoke.I took a deep breath and looked at the crowd of people gossiping, and they slowly dispersed and eventually disappeared.Two hours had passed since I got kicked out of the dormitories.It felt like my brain had stopped working because of the unbelievable situation I was in, leaving me feeling dizzy. Good thing I had finally calmed down somehow.While I knew this was a completely unrealistic scenario, I was still able to accept these drastic changes to some extent. Being able to quickly calm down must be something Ed Rothstaylor was capable of.But enough about that. Right now, I needed to figure out what I had to do. I needed to establish my course of action.I opened my wooden bag and took out an ornate mirror from my belongings. I looked at my reflection, my previous appearance now gone. Instead, there was a handsome-looking blonde boy staring right back at me.This was now my new appearance.[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 3Intelligence: 4Dexterity: 7Willpower: 7Luck: 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226bHaving played \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019 five times now, it was already a familiar information window to me.This was the same method used to open one\u2019s information in the game. By using any object that shows your reflection like a mirror, a creek, a pond, or even a glass cup, you just have to imbue it with your magic power to see your skills window.The similarities going this far made this feel even more like a dream.And looking at my skills only made me wish this really\u00a0was\u00a0a dream.These pathetic skills were not befitting of a student attending the Silvenia Academy\u2019s Magic Department. His embarrassingly low Vitality must be because of his upbringing as an aristocrat.In the game, a regular farmer\u2019s Vitality averaged between a five to a six. The main character, who was focused on combat and fighting skills, had a Vitality of above 20. So considering these numbers, Ed\u2019s Vitality stat was truly pathetic.Although looking at the numbers, my Dexterity and Willpower seem to be decent, but still nothing extraordinary. Comparing my skills to that of the main character, the differences were quite obvious.Ed Rothstaylor was just a third-rate villain who appeared at the beginning of the game to add some conflict.He was nothing more or less than that. I don\u2019t even remember what happened to him afterward.No, wait\u2014I do remember.At the end of the game, he briefly showed up in the credits, begging on the streets of the city while sitting on a straw mat.Ahh\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have remembered that.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh as I laid back.Ed was a noble who grew up sheltered, ignorant to the ways of the world, only to be one day thrown out onto the streets with nothing. It was an expected ending for him.For now, I had to avoid starving on the side of the street as he did.And how was I supposed to do that?I didn\u2019t have the answer to that question.But after thinking it over for a while, I could only say this:By whatever means, I would survive.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: 10 Days Before School StartsSilvenia Academy was more like a bustling city rather than a school.Founded on the entire Acken Island southwest of the kingdom, the school was so massive that even alumni were yet to explore the whole campus.But what did that mean?It meant one could encounter anything walking around the extensive school grounds.The students\u2019 heavy gazes followed me as I walked, and I ended up at an undeveloped forest somewhere northwest of the island.Most school facilities were located in the southeast while commercial and services facilities were in the southwest. The island used to only have one bridge connecting both sides, the buildings naturally developing around it.I eventually arrived at the northeastern edge of the island after walking the whole afternoon. My legs were so sore I had to sit on a tree stump to rest.After walking half the day, I was able to organize my thoughts and came to a conclusion.\"First things first. I'm not leaving this island.\"There's no helping it. I was now Ed Rothstaylor. I had to find a way to adapt and live somehow.Silvenia Academy received the highest praise among the prestigious academies in the kingdom. It's a school where noble families desperately aim to enroll their children, a school that required either overwhelming talent or wealth.Obtaining a Silvenia diploma would enable me to make a living. I needed to bear through this and obtain mine. Nothing is as valuable in this difficult and unpredictable world.Besides, leaving the academy would be the same as throwing my life away.I had played through \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019 a few times already.If Ed Rothstaylor just got expelled, that meant the story had just begun.This meant I\u2019m in a position where I knew most of the things that would happen in the academy. As long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll be able to use my knowledge of the game to my advantage.I saw no reason for me to go out into the unknown world outside.The sun was setting before I knew it.Sat alone on a tree stump in a deserted forest, I let out another deep sigh and wiped my face.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201dI put the two wooden suitcases on the grass and opened them.They were full of clothes and old textbooks. There were some magic tools but since their output was adjusted for students, they weren\u2019t very useful.Despite having lived in such an extravagant room, this was everything I owned. What an empty life\u2026Even though I got kicked out of my family, at least I haven\u2019t been expelled from the academy yet.Although it could already be considered an expulsion, given I won\u2019t be able to afford the enormous tuition without my family\u2019s support. Thankfully, my tuition had already been paid until the next semester.If I could endure until then and get a scholarship or find a way to earn money, I would still be able to attend the academy.However, I needed to be mindful of my time limit. I only had until next semester to figure things out.\u201cThe scenery sure is beautiful\u2026\u201dI found a stream after walking a bit more. It flowed from the other side of the island all the way here. I let myself enjoy the beautiful forest bathed in moonlight, quiet with only the sound of crickets.But this wasn\u2019t the time to be sentimental. I\u2019ll starve to death at this rate.There were a lot of things I needed to live a good life.I tore a twig off a tree and wrote on the ground.Goal = GraduationMy goal was to graduate.Ed Rothstaylor is currently in his second year. That leaves me six more semesters until graduation.The tuition fee for one semester was about 20 gold coins, an amount enough to buy a whole carriage covered in gold.But that price is cheap compared to all the other expenses.Most of the students stayed in luxury dormitories, only ate fine-dining meals, and only used high-class magic equipment, all while bringing two to three servants with them.Taking all of that into account, the price of a gold-plated carriage doesn\u2019t seem so expensive in perspective.I didn\u2019t know what to do about my tuition fees, nor about obtaining a scholarship. With my lackluster skills, it\u2019d be hard enough trying not to fail, let alone qualify for one.It makes no sense why Ed had such an arrogant personality given his lack of skill.But it was a question not even worth asking. He was just a character at the beginning of the game, written for the protagonist to win against.Anyhow, the most important thing right now was to sort out the things I needed to live and survive.The important trinity of food, clothing, and shelter.I had clothes. I didn\u2019t know if I would be able to do my laundry but I should be able to avoid looking like a beggar for a week.Food and shelter were my problems. I had nowhere to sleep and nothing to eat tonight.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dNo! I shook my head and slapped my cheeks.\u201cNothing will change if all I do is sigh!\u201dI clenched my teeth, stood up, and began stretching. First, my hips, then my legs, then a full set of the national gymnastic routine, finishing off with a set of jumping exercises and pushups.The sound of my heavy breathing refreshed my body and mind.Because the entrance exam had already taken place, there shouldn\u2019t be much time left until the semester starts. If I were to guess, there were probably only ten days left.The first thing I needed to do was make a livable environment so I could continue going to the academy. I could build something in ten days.I should build a place I could live in. There was a pleasant cool spring breeze blowing so I could sleep out in the open if I really needed to but\u2026 I didn\u2019t know if I would be able to sleep on the ground.Should I make a simple tent?I don\u2019t need to go out of my way to make a proper tent. A simple shelter shouldn\u2019t be all that hard. If I were to use thick tree trunks as supports and cover them with a canopy, it should become somewhat of a roofed shelter.The forest in the northeastern part of Acken Island was quite well preserved.Spotting a spirit meant the place had yet to be touched by humans.There were many tree trunks that could be used to support the canopy in the area.\u201cI should at least be moving while thinking.\u201dI don\u2019t have the luxury of only thinking. I should also be working as well.Staring at my reflection on the stream, I focused on my eyes once again.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 3Intelligence: 4Dexterity: 7Willpower: 7Luck: 6Combat Skills Details\u00a0\u226bMagic Skills Details\u00a0\u226bLife Skills Details\u00a0\u226bAlchemy Skills Details\u00a0\u226bIgnoring my embarrassing stats, I focused on the details of my Magic Skills.[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Low-grade MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700\u00a0Fast Casting Level 1\u0700\u00a0Mana Sense Level 1Fire Element Magic:\u0700\u00a0Ignite Level 2Wind Element Magic:\u0700\u00a0Wind Blade Level 1Magicians specializing in Elements only have two basic magic spells.Furthermore, first year elemental-based magicians were required to choose two elements to specialize in. Ed looked to have chosen fire and wind, but seeing as he hardly trained even the most basics of his spells, he really was lazy.Whatever. At least I was able to check that I had magic spells I could use.I felt the mana in my body the deeper I went into the forest. Of course, compared to the protagonist\u2019s overflowing amount of mama, mine was infinitely weaker. At least it enabled me to cut down these moderately sized tree trunks.I used\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0to cut the branches down to a manageable size. There would be no point if I couldn\u2019t carry them back.After cutting through five to six tree trunks, I was already out of breath. Just like I expected, this body couldn\u2019t handle mana freely. I desperately needed to train.\u201cSeriously. What a freaking pain.\u201dI spat on the ground and caught my breath for a moment, then took the cut branches to where there is sunlight.The frames kept slipping off the ground because the strength wasn\u2019t balanced. This wasn\u2019t working. It would be better to dig out holes to put down the foundations.After digging out the holes and setting up the four foundations, I angled them to meet in the middle.It wasn\u2019t an easy task. I only had two hands for the four support beams. Thankfully, I was able to compensate by holding the pieces of wood with my head and shoulder.I tied the pieces of wood together where they met with a leather belt. It was from a high-class tunic I found in my bag. I then used the last piece of wood as a stake through the middle, digging it into the ground to make sure the whole thing won\u2019t fall over.Although a bit lame and unstable, the frame of my shelter was completed. It wasn\u2019t pretty. The branches didn\u2019t exactly meet in the middle, and because I didn\u2019t calculate anything, the resulting height was lower than I anticipated.That said, once I covered this with a canopy, it should be good enough to spend the night in.I considered using some of my clothes to cover the top but ultimately decided against it.Not only would I need to use four to five pieces to cover the whole frame, but it would also mean sacrificing clothes I would wear starting tomorrow. I didn\u2019t want to do that.Besides, these clothes were of high quality. I may even be able to sell them. I didn\u2019t want to just use them as a roof.To compromise, I decided to tie two pieces of clothes together and laid them on the ground. I couldn\u2019t just sleep on the dirt.What should I use to cover my shelter with then? No matter how much I thought about it, I still didn\u2019t know what to do. I eventually went back into the forest and brought back tree branches with long and wide leaves.The whole process took almost an hour.And another hour to cover my shelter with the branches.\u201cPhew\u2026. Ha\u2026 This is exhausting.\u201dFinally done, I stretched my back and wiped my sweat off. It was hard work but at least it\u2019s now over.In front of me was a shelter I could lay down in. I felt a sense of accomplishment at the feat.\u300a Production completed. Production skills have increased. \u300b\u300a The list of completed products has been updated. \u300bThe message popped up.\u201cHm?\u201dI tilted my head, puzzled. I went to the stream and focused on my eyes.The window that materialized wasn\u2019t the usual long information window. Instead, it was different.[ Life Skills Details ]Grade: Beginner CraftsmenSpecialized Fields: None\u0700\u00a0Handicraft Level 4\u0700\u00a0Design Level 1\u0700\u00a0Collecting Skills Level 1\u201cOh?

It made sense, I guess, given how his Dexterity was better than his Intelligence and Vitality.[ Newly Crafted Product ]Simple Wooden ShelterA shelter where you can temporarily rest.It\u2019s of low-grade quality and is quite shabby.If you don\u2019t maintain it, its duration won\u2019t last long.Production Difficulty Level:\u00a0\u25d0\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cbThe window was a welcome sight.

That\u2019s great news.Thinking about it, it\u2019s possible to overcome my current situation after all.I\u2019m too tired right now, however, and am mentally at my limit.I needed a break.I went and laid down in my completed shelter, listening to the buzz of nature all around me.Darkness arrived. Unable to see anything, I closed my eyes and felt myself slowly drifting off to sleep.I knew I was in a difficult situation, left with so many things to resolve.But for now, I needed to sleep. Sleep first, then I will face tomorrow.And tomorrow, after sunrise, I will find a long-term plan to survive in this academy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: 7 Days Before School Starts (1)Three days passed by somehow.I didn't spend the last three days in vain. It would be too tiring to list everything I did, but also too difficult to briefly summarize them.The first thing I actually did was fortify the shelter I made.On the second night, my shelter unexpectedly collapsed, and I had to fetch more wood from the forest to reinforce the frame.It would've been great had I had a rope to secure the frame together, but since I didn\u2019t have any, I just dug more holes for the foundation and stuck the support beams into each.And then I was worried it may leak if it rained, so I ended up sacrificing three to four pieces of my clothes to cover the leaves I used as the roof. I then covered the clothes with even larger leaves.Well, the added weight caused the support beams to collapse. I ended up having to add horizontal supports to hold the weight.Then I had to twist some of my old clothes together and use them as ropes to tie the new frame together.The truth is, I actually felt it was a waste to use some of my clothes this way. I thought if I took them to a pawnshop, I would have gotten at least a few silver coins for them.Although after giving it some thought, I decided not to. There was no way a pawnshop would buy such clothes unless they were luxury items adorned with jewels.I still had a few valuables I could sell so it should be fine. However, the pawn shop is in the next city.It would be difficult to leave Acken Island just to go to the shop. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t make enough profits to even return, and that's something I didn't want. And while taking a carriage would be a quick trip, walking would take me two days and one night. Since I didn't have money for a carriage, walking would've been my only option. The journey wouldn't have been an easy one.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dSitting by the stream, I sharpened the tip of a branch with my dagger.Since I decided not to leave the academy grounds, I needed to work on my three basic needs.Food, clothing, and shelter.I had enough clothes to wear for the next few days. I even had a house, although shabby. The problem was I had nothing to eat.I went to find food in the forest on the second day. I actually used to live in the countryside in my past life. That\u2019s probably why the forest and the mountain felt familiar somehow.Finding food is a different matter, however. There were plants everywhere, but distinguishing which was edible was a different matter. I wasn\u2019t an expert on survival, by any means. There was a limit to what my eyes could discern as edible or not.In the end, I opted to cut the bark off some pine trees instead.Tree barks had an inner white flesh. My grandfather told me about it when I was young. He said he used to boil and eat tree bark when harvests were terrible and food was scarce.I ripped the white flesh off the outer bark using a ceremonial dagger I found in my luggage. Lighting a fire with my magic, I cooked the flesh in boiling water from the stream using a decorational cup, not having any pot with me.Once cooked, I gnawed on the chewy bark of the pine tree. It was awful but I managed to eat all of it.Then I had raging diarrhea that night.I guessed tree bark was never meant for human consumption after all.I was starving on the third day. On top of that, I was also suffering from diarrhea. I looked beyond terrible.I shaved off a branch and tied the ceremonial dagger to one end using a handkerchief. However, the handkerchief felt loose so I had to use vines I scavenged from the forest to tighten the dagger and the wood together.[ Newly Crafted Product ]Simple HarpoonMade using a ceremonial dagger tied to a well-cut branch.Can be used for fishing or hunting.The dagger is not as sharp, reducing its power and effectiveness.Production Difficulty Level:\u00a0\u25d0\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Production completed. Production skills have increased. \u300bWhen I was younger, I used to show off that I was skilled in catching freshwater fish. But now that I was at death's door from hunger, catching fish had become serious business.Even though the dagger wasn't as sharp compared to a traditional fishing harpoon, I could make up for it with my experience.The firewood crackled as it burned. It was a relief I had fire magic. It meant I didn't have to go through all the trouble of starting a fire.I somehow felt grateful to Ed for choosing to specialize in Fire.\u2026\u2026Although, was this even something to be thankful for?Anyhow, since I was having no luck in gathering food, it was the right decision to focus on hunting instead. I was able to catch some freshwater fish, thanks to the skills I had when I was younger.I skewered the fishes I caught and grilled them over the fire. The problem was they became softer as they cooked. The meat started flaking and falling off the wood, causing me to lose so many precious pieces of fish.It would\u2019ve been great if I could make something similar to a grill, but because I lacked the proper materials, I wouldn\u2019t be able to right now. I ended up having to eat the hot fish straight from the stick, burning my tongue.\u201cKyaaah!\u201dI could almost feel my body absorbing its much-needed nutrients.To be honest, it didn\u2019t taste that great. But I was thankful enough to eat and fill my stomach with something.I ended up eating about four to five fish. To drink, I dunked my head down the stream and gulped down a few swallows of the freshwater.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dI wasn\u2019t full, by any means. But I was able to deal with the immediate hunger that had been bothering me for the last two days.I laid down on the gravel by the stream, looking up at the sky. Laying down idly, the sun slowly began to set.One more week until school started.I had been having difficulties resolving my problems with food, clothing, and shelter. How harder would it be when school starts? Would it even be possible for me to receive a scholarship?But instead of debating with myself whether it\u2019d be possible or not, I just had to go for it. A Silvenia Academy diploma would be a reliable tool to survive in this unpredictable world.Graduates of Silvenia went on to become important individuals in the kingdom. No matter how poorly they did at the academy, the mere fact that they were from Silvenia allowed them to fill high-ranking positions in expedition forces and in the local underground magic society.Simply put, no matter how hard staying in Silvenia may be, it would still be several times better than starting out with nothing.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cIs someone there?\u201dI heard a voice calling while I lay down by the stream.The northern part of Acken Island was not a place students and professors visited often. This area was never used aside for practical exercises and tests.This was why hearing the young voice came as a surprise.Even more so that I recognized whose voice it was.\u201cIs that you\u2026 Ed Rothstaylor?\u201dIt was the 3rd princess of the Kroel Empire, Penia Elias Kroel. Also known as Princess Penia.Princess Penia was one of the four main heroines in \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019. She was an influential character during the first half of the story. Well, at least, that was what was going to happen. Right now, she must still be a freshman.She was set to meet the protagonist \u2018Taylee\u2019 during the entrance examination, where she took the exam with her identity hidden\u2026That\u2019s right. She was the one who accused me, revealing that I manipulated the test due to my envy of the protagonist, providing the perfect opportunity for my family to disown me.\u201c\u2026I heard you were disowned. What are you doing here?\u201dWhat was I doing here?That\u2019s what I wanted to ask her.This wasn\u2019t a place the third princess would normally visit, someone who was usually escorted by six to seven of her knights.I looked up at the princess.Her elegant white-blonde hair and frill dress did not match the wild forest background.And yet, she didn\u2019t look to be dressed as fancy as she normally would have.Only then did I realize that the \u2018Class Assignment Examination Episode\u2019 must currently be taking place.It was definitely\u2026 an episode that took place in the northern forest of Acken Island.Held a week before school started, it was a test to determine the students\u2019 levels before entering the academy\u2019s Magic Department.Professor Glast of the Magic Department, infamous for his nasty personality, was in charge of the freshmen\u2019s examination.The exam was to find the magically infused marbles spread randomly across the northern forest. It was a test to see if the students were able to detect the magic. After all, the basis of magic starts with sensing it.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you again, Princess Penia.\u201dHer eyes were fierce, the eyes of someone who despised me. It felt unfair, given my circumstances. But no one would believe me, even if I told anyone.I sat up and respectfully gave my greetings to the princess.\u201cI thought you would have been kicked out from the academy.\u201d\u201cI was kicked out of the dormitory.\u201d\u201cI asked what you are doing here.\u201dThe princess looked at the simple shelter I built, the campfire I lit, and the bones from the fish I ate with disbelief on her face.\u201cYou still haven\u2019t left the academy?\u201d\u201cUnfortunate as it may be, I am still a student.\u201d\u201cDid you not go through with the expulsion process?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was necessary. I was humiliated and no longer receiving support from my own family, so there was no way for me to continue attending the academy.\u201dPrincess Penia\u2019s lips had twisted, probably finding it hard to believe that a nobleman who had been humiliated and excommunicated would be able to continue attending Silvenia.\u201cIf the Academic Affairs Committee finds out about this, you will be expelled right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the committee tomorrow. Did you think you would be allowed to stay here?\u201dMy plan to obtain a diploma from Silvenia Academy was already about to be ruined.But I shouldn\u2019t think like that. I let out a deep sigh and began thinking of a solution.\u201cIf the princess herself judges it to be so, it can\u2019t be helped. In fact, not just you, but many of the students despise me. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for the academy\u2019s staff as well.\u201d\u201cIf you already know that, why don\u2019t you just leave on your own then? Isn\u2019t it better to leave with dignity rather than go through a humiliating expulsion process?\u201d\u201cI want to continue attending Silvenia Academy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t recommend doing it.\u201dPrincess Penia crossed her arms and stared at me with contempt.\u201cLeave. Everyone here despises you, and you despise everyone else.\u201d\u201cYou must be mistaken. I don\u2019t despise anyone.\u201d\u201cYou must not remember how arrogant you were, how much hatred you had inside of you. Well, it is difficult to view oneself objectively.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dMy only way to salvage this situation was to talk myself out of it.\u201cThe truth is, princess, I actually feel grateful towards you.\u201dPrincess Penia looked at me in disbelief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: 7 Days Before Schools Starts (2)The Rothstaylor family I was once a part of is a family of villains.Drunk on the power of their name, every new generation had devolved into conceit and elitism.The honorable and generous ancestors had all gone. All that was left was their sense of privilege as they condescendingly sat in high positions of power in the empire.Actually, the Rothstaylor family had a big secret.The head of the family, Krepin Rothstaylor, signed a contract with the Evil God of the Mythic Age, Mebula, to study the magic of eternal life. Due to this, many inhumane experiments had been conducted, sacrificing numerous lives in the name of research.Two years later, this secret was discovered by Taylee, the protagonist.After struggling until the end, Krepin Rothstaylor was finally defeated.The head of the Rothstaylor family\u2013Krepin Rothstaylor.He was the final boss in Act 4 of \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019.After that, what happened to the arrogant and entitled Rothstaylor family was as expected.The family's horrible downfall brought excitement to the players. Everyone who actively took part in Krepin Rothstaylor\u2019s plans was executed. Even those who were only partially involved were, at the very least, either imprisoned or punished.Considering all of that, my current situation was worthy of a second look.Yes, I was cold and hungry, not knowing what I was to do with my life.But wasn't I cut off from the Rothstaylor family in advance?Simply put, there's only one thing for me to say.This was actually a good turn of events.* * *\u201cDid you just say you are thankful to me? I find that hard to believe.\u201dI stood up from my seat. But considering I have lived in the wild for the last three days, I probably didn't look my best. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s why the princess looked taken aback.Only a few days ago, she saw me as a noble, acting like a condescending jerk to others. It must've felt satisfying for her to see me now. Although there might also be a bit of pity there.I thought of taking advantage of that. However, as far as I know, Princess Penia never let her personal feelings intervene with public judgment. Appealing to her emotions would more likely backfire.What was the best outcome for me in this situation?Regardless of whether I went to this school or not, it would be for Princess Penia to stop concerning herself with me.Not only the princess, but all the other students of Silvenia Academy also needed to stop paying me any attention. If it was uselessly publicized that Ed Rothstaylor hadn\u2019t been expelled, I would be the only one losing.From the academy's perspective, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if I quit school at any time. I was already straddling the border of expulsion. From a more academic perspective, I shouldn\u2019t do anything to stand out until I was in a better position to not get expelled.It would do me nothing good to be hated by the princess.\u201cMy fate will be decided by Princess Penia. I will obediently follow your will.\u201dI calmly said, pretending as if nothing was wrong.It was a bit disappointing, but groveling at her feet would only backfire. The more cornered and desperate one looked, the easier it was for people to think of them as useless and a mess.Princess Penia was known as the 'Princess of Benevolence' due to her unique 'eyes'.Eyes that gave insight into the depths of people's humanity.She grew up recognizing when she was being told words of flattery, lip service, and malicious deceptions.Hidden within a princess with seemingly infinite benevolence were the eyes of a monarch capable of weighing human nature with a glance.I turned to look at my campfire, the burning firewood turning into ashes.I could use\u00a0Ignite\u00a0to light it again, but I hadn't properly trained my body yet. I didn't want to use magic for no reason.I walked past the princess and sat by the fire, stirring the embers with a stick to collect the scattered pieces back into the hearth.\"You have been here for three days now?\"\u201cI have to do what I can to live.\u201dI\u2019ve decided on a definite rule.The best way to not receive attention was to not give anyone attention.I didn't care what others did. If I kept this attitude, they would probably stop paying attention to me as well.But the fact that this was the third princess of the empire had brought tremendous anxiety. Although compared to crying and begging on my knees, this was a strategy that had the potential to succeed.Please don't pay me any mind, princess.However, I knew that this alone was not enough.\"I heard the step every royal takes is noble. Even for short walks, dozens of servants were said to follow. Even half-day outings required the presence of heavily armed guards.\"Bribery and flattery were necessary.Nevertheless, there was an issue.If you had nothing to offer, your words would be nothing more than cheap flattery.\"The sun is just about to set, and the noble Princess Penia is traveling alone in the dangerous northern forest. I suppose there must be a reason for that.\"Even when she was walking around the academy, her servants followed and waited on her wherever she went.In this situation, she must have had her guards with her, hiding among the trees with weapons in their hands. It was obvious that any wrong move toward the princess would have dire consequences.\"What are you trying to say? If you want to harm me since I don't have a knight with me, you will regret that decision.\"Then I guess I could try saying things a bit more boldly.I smiled.\"Professor Glast\u2019s class assignment examination is rumored to be viciously tough among the second years. He's a professor who likes to make students suffer in quite unique ways each year. I\u2019m guessing you must be taking his exam right now?\"I didn\u2019t even look at the princess and continued poking at the campfire.\u201cIf you go to the lake southeast of the forest, you will find a small rocky island in the middle of it. The size can only fit about one grown pine tree. That tree is 'The Guardian Tree of Merilda\u2019. If you look inside the tree, you're bound to have a good harvest.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cEither way, you will search through the entire forest anyway. It won\u2019t hurt to stop by.\u201dI could feel the princess glaring at my back. Even though it felt like she was burning a hole through me, I pretended not to care.\u201cWhat are you planning? Do you still want to get revenge?\u201d\u201cAs I told you, I just want to continue attending Silvenia.\u201dThe campfire crackled with a spark as I barely managed to revive the fire.\u201cThis is\u2026 It can be considered a bribe that I'm offering the princess.\u201dI finally threw the stick I\u2019d been using into the fire.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it\u2026 There\u2019s nothing I can do if you won\u2019t take it.\u201dThe princess glared at me for a long time. She later left after scolding me that whatever I was planning wasn\u2019t funny.Well, the princess's move was now out of my hands.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cLet go of me! Don\u2019t you know who I am? I am Ed Rothstaylor, the second son of the Rothstaylor family! Get your dirty hands off me, you pigs! Just where are you touching me?\u201d\u201cTaylee? Ha\u2026 A low-ranking failure of a student who's all talk.\u201d\u201cEh? P-Princess? The Benevolent Princess Penia? M-my apologies, I didn\u2019t notice the princess.\u201d\u201cPrincess! If you defend bugs like Taylee, your noble and high name will be tarnished. Please punish him!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 This is wrong. This is a trap! A setup! That trash Taylee is just jealous! That filthy bug!\u201d\u201cIs he even the same person?\u201dAs Princess Penia walked through the forest, she recalled what she saw during the entrance exam.She remembered a vain nobleman who tried to force out Taylee, a student who eventually failed, by tampering with his test.That Ed Rothstaylor was such a pathetic and ugly human being that the princess didn\u2019t even need to use her unique \u2018Insightful Eyes.\u2019 Anyone could tell that he was an arrogant and unsightly man.He grovels in front of those with power and becomes cruel to the weak. When the princess hid her identity at first, she was also a victim of such rudeness.She believed that such a person shouldn\u2019t belong in Silvenia, so she made a move herself.Even though Princess Penia was still just a student, the Academic Affairs Committee couldn\u2019t thoughtlessly ignore her opinion. After all,\u00a0 she held a position within the royal family.Three days have passed since Ed Rothstaylor's evil misdeeds were revealed and his family excommunicated him.The way he talked had become much more poised.It may be true that three days should be enough time for a person to reflect on oneself and change. Though honestly, I didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to that right now.The problem she needed to focus on is the Class Assignment Examination.The infamously evil Professor Glast\u2019s exam of searching for the magic-infused marbles.Students were tasked to find the marbles scattered throughout the northern forest and then return to the faculty building. The test started just after noon and continued on until now as the sun had almost completely set.Of the 310 new students of the Magic Department, about 290 of them had already found marbles and had returned to the faculty building.More than half of the students returned with a marble within the first hour.Only a few students remained searching the northern forest until sunset.Princess Penia had actually found marbles almost immediately. Having basic magic power detection abilities would enable anyone to find as many as possible.The princess already found a lot of marbles: between leaves, near piles of dirt, under a small wooden bench.But something felt strange.The number of magic-infused marbles was higher than the number of students. It wasn\u2019t more than just a few, it was several times more.Even though it was only the first test since getting accepted, it felt way too easy. The exam itself was too kind to have been given by Professor Glast, who was infamously known for being an evil professor.It was obvious there was a hidden intention. That fact wouldn't leave the princess's mind.Most of the students quickly returned to the faculty building, assuming the exam was a \u2018first come, first serve\u2019 basis.When the sun began to set, the students who were skeptical of the exam's easy difficulty also began to return without finding an answer. It was interesting to see them return with a good number of marbles, focusing on quantity rather than quality.The moon was now in the sky.Nevertheless, Princess Penia didn\u2019t return to the faculty building.She constantly thought that there must be some hidden intention within the test.After walking for a while, she ended up at the lake.There, she saw the rock island that Ed Rothstaylor mentioned.A pine tree mysteriously sat in the middle of the lake under the moonlit sky.According to him, that tree was \u2018The Guardian Tree of Merilda.\u2019\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dPrincess Penia held her chin as she thought it over for a while. Eventually, she gathered magic power at the tip of her toes.\u201cWater Walking.\u201dIt was a spell that consumed a lot of power, allowing the user to walk on water.But due to its poor magic power efficiency, it was hard to maintain for a long time. Thus, it was not a very practical skill in battle.However, in this case, it should suffice for the short length so the princess could cross without getting wet.Princess Penia slowly walked across the surface of the lake and noticed that part of the tree had fallen off.Perhaps Ed Rothstaylor was still set on revenge and had set a trap.If he were to do such a thing against the Benevolent Princess, things wouldn't end well for him.Ed Rothstaylor should be well aware of that.But there was nothing wrong with being more careful. The princess cautiously approached the old tree, alert as much as possible.\u201cA magic-infused marble\u2026? But the color is different\u2026\u201dThere was a bright golden marble in the hollow of the tree, shining softly.Princess Penia tilted her head.\u201cIt\u2019s a unique design\u2026 It\u2019s golden in color and gives off a subtle glow but\u2026 there\u2019s nothing else to it.\u201dJust in case, she tried to detect the marble's magic power, but the amount of magic itself was very insignificant. It was hardly noticeable.\u201cAlthough\u2026 it seems like an object with some meaning.\u201dThe princess swept her platinum blonde hair up and lowered herself, careful not to have her well-managed hair touch the ground.Crouching down, she looked at the marble stuck in the tree and thought about taking it.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201dShe only discovered the marble because Ed Rothstaylor told her where it was.The princess herself had not discovered it. Therefore, her pride wouldn't allow her to take the marble for herself.In the end, Princess Penia decided to leave the lake.She knew all too well how shameless it would be to pass the test in such an unjust way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: 6 Days Before School Starts (1)[Newly Crafted Product]Low-Grade Fishing RodMade from a tree branch polished by a dagger, repurposed silk threads from fabric, and a small nail as a replacement for a hook.It has poor durability.Difficult to determine whether a fish has bitten or not due to the lack of a fishing float.Production Difficulty Level:\u00a0\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Production completed. Production skills have increased. \u300bI realized that the biggest drawback to harpoon fishing was the fact that it required too much energy.So I thought about using a fishing rod and made one instead. There were a lot of branches for me to use so I just chose the one closest to the right size.I then found a fabric among my belongings made of silk. I pulled a few threads out and layered them to use as the fishing line.I also had to take one of the small nails attaching the hinge of one of my wooden suitcases. I ended up breaking one of the bags as I didn\u2019t have a claw hammer to take it out.In the end, I had a fishing rod, low-grade as it may be. For bait, I was able to obtain earthworms from under the rocks near the stream.With everything ready, I threw the line into the water.I sat down by the stream and waited for a fish to bite.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t so bad sitting down waiting, chin in my hand. Compared to running around in the water and getting drenched, this felt as though I have become some sort of god.\u201cIt would be great if this succeeds.\u201dI remembered when I was young, running around the mountains and streams in my childhood. I had no worries back then, no fear of dying from hunger. I was able to just be happy. Thinking back on those times made me feel emotional for some reason.\u201cHmm\u2026 I don't think I did anything wrong.\u201dI thought of pointless things as I held onto my fishing rod, wondering if I made the right decision telling Princess Penia about the golden marble.\u201cI should be more careful next time.\u201dMy biggest advantage was knowing everything that would happen at Silvenia Academy in the future.But if I were to do something useless and end up changing the future\u2026 then wouldn\u2019t I have just thrown away my own advantage?According to what I knew, Princess Penia wasn\u2019t supposed to find the golden marble.If it were to follow the story, the person who was supposed to find the location of that marble was someone named \u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019.She was a talented person who always placed 1st in the Magic Department, starting from the class assignment examination all the way to graduation.\u201cWell, in my defense, that was the only plan I could come up with in that dire situation.\u201dIt couldn't be helped, the more pressing matter was to make sure that Princess Penia wouldn\u2019t expel me from school.I knew desperately begging and appealing to her emotions would be the worst thing I could do.While the best thing was to make her strangely suspicious of me so she feels that she shouldn\u2019t kick me out of the academy.It wasn't the most convenient choice, but I thought it wouldn't be too dangerous. Although it was an unusual stance to take.If someone were to ask me what kind of bullshit excuse I was saying\u2026 Well, I would have nothing else to say. I mean, it's not that difficult to talk crap, to be honest.* * *Professor Glast was known as the \u2018rude skull-faced bastard\u2019 amongst the students.It wasn't unusual for students to give teachers mean nicknames. However, even Professor Glast\u2019s nickname could be considered a bit too harsh. Although the reason for it was rather accurate, the professor was both rude and resembled a skeleton.\u201cI will announce the results of yesterday's Class Assignment Examination.\u201dThe busiest and most well-maintained area was Phillis Hall, located in the southeast part of the island. All the freshmen students from the Magic Department sat waiting while Professor Glast was on the podium.He had a scrawny and pale appearance. And due to his neatly slicked back light-green hair, his bony facial features were more prominent.\u201cFirst off, all of you \u2018brats\u2019 who came back within the first hour will all start in Class F.\u201dThe entire hall became noisy at his words.\u201cNext, all of you \u2018brats\u2019 who thought for a bit then brought back lots of marbles, you still have room for improvement, at the very least. Depending on the type of marbles you brought, you will be assigned to a class ranging from Class E to Class D.\u201dLooking down on the students and having the attitude to keep calling them \u2018brats\u2019 was already quite rude. Among these students are famous aristocrats, powerful and wealthy people, and even royalty\u2013and yet, he didn\u2019t care.It was law in Silvenia Academy. When it comes to education, the hierarchy shouldn't be important.It was considered separate from the lifestyle and personal relationships of the students. Learning was an even playing field.\u201cThere are only three students accepted into Class A where they will be guaranteed the highest level of treatment and education\u2013Lortel, Lucy, and Ziggs. Among them is Lucy, who came on top of the class. As for the rest of you, you can check your position on the list I distributed. I do not accept appeals. That will be all.\u201dAfter his speech, chaos ensued once again. Professor Glast tried to come down from the podium, dusting off the fabric of his robe.- \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? I can\u2019t accept this!\u201d- \u201cThe criteria wasn\u2019t even clear. Did you just randomly assign our classes?\u201d- \u201cPlease explain yourself! What were the intentions of this test and what skills did you want to see?!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Some students loudly complained amidst the commotion. Professor Glast went back to the podium, as if he had already expected this reaction, and cast Voice Expansion on himself.\u201cThe intention\u2026 why should I have to explain any of that?\u201dEveryone was shocked by his words. Princess Penia was shocked herself.The princess looked at the issued list and was left speechless.The freshmen were divided into six levels: Class F to Class A.Only three students made it into Class A and not a single student made it into Class B or C. The remaining students were all split into Class D, E, and F. Princess Penia\u2019s name was listed under Class D. And even then, she couldn\u2019t believe that her rank was already in the top 10%.\u201cIf you want to get into a higher class, then prove your ability. That\u2019s what you need to do.\u201dThe situation was more ridiculous than the princess had thought.She felt humiliated but soon shook her head.Before the entrance ceremony, the headmaster already talked about this. Once she entered Silvenia Academy, there would be many cases where she would not be treated comparably to her authority as a princess.It was Princess Penia herself who decided to escape her grand but impractical training room to learn magic at Silvenia Academy on equal footing with everyone else.She was ready to accept this humiliation.But she still needed to understand.\u201cEven then, at the very least, you can explain the situation a bit more, Sir Glast.\u201dThe words left her lips.She didn\u2019t raise her voice, but the murmuring ceased at once. Everyone was already aware.That here with them was a princess of the kingdom.As a student, she temporarily placed the importance of her status behind her, but she couldn\u2019t completely erase her inherent noble nature.\u201cPrincess Penia, I\u2019m sorry to say this but this is my education policy.\u201dA cold gaze.She had felt that very same gaze from the many vassals who sat next to the king, vassals who were knowledgeable in their abilities and ways. Professor Glast\u2019s eyes contained that same specific coldness.Using her Insightful Eyes, she could definitely see it, a feeling that she felt so often that she was already sick and tired of it.\u201cBut\u2026 If Princess Penia says so, I will make an exception just this one time.\u201dAnd that attitude of willingly ignoring his own rules was also similar.\u201cHowever, even if I tell you, I just know you will all misunderstand and say I made the reason up. To prevent this, I will have the top student explain it instead. Lucy Mayreel? Lucy?\u201dThe professor called Lucy\u2019s name but there was no answer.\u201cMs. Lucy? She should be here right now. Ms. Lucy?\u201dAnother commotion broke out as the students looked around, trying to find where Luxy was.\u201cUgh\u2026 Keugh\u2026\u201dJust then, the girl sitting two seats ahead of Princess Penia reacted.She looked a bit disoriented. The witch hat that covered her face was much bigger than her head, so much so that even her shoulders were covered. Her frame was so small that even the sleeves of her robes were hanging off her arms.\u201cWere you dozing off?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes\u2026 I dozed off\u2026\u201dHer voice itself sounded drowsy, coupled with her droopy eyes that made her look tired.She even admitted that she had dozed off. She was clearly one of those\u2026 weirdos.\u201cWould you like to come up to the podium for a moment and discuss the intention and methods you used to solve the test?\u201dLucy\u2019s eyes shook at the professor\u2019s suggestions.It was obvious she was annoyed.\u201cDo I have to do it\u2026 now?\u201dTension filled the air at her words. She just openly said, \u2018It\u2019s bothersome,\u2019 in front of Professor Glass, someone who was known to be extremely rude.However, some of the students who had heard certain rumors about Professor Glast weren\u2019t very surprised at his answer.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cUuek\u2026\u201dThe professor was extremely harsh to the untalented but was merciful to those who are.Professor Glast was that kind of person.\u201cKgghh\u2026 Ackk\u2026! Kyaaak!\u201dLucy threw her wide-brimmed witch hat to the empty seat next to her. She stretched both her arms and legs wide apart like a baby cat who just woke up from a deep nap.She stood up like a caterpillar. Although it would be more apt to say she looked like a sloth.\u201cYou may answer there if you don\u2019t want to come all the way here. Just explain how you found the golden marble in \u2018The Guardian Tree of Merilda\u2019.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come all the way to the podium, you may answer there. You can just explain how you found the golden marble in \u2018The Guardian Tree of Merilda.\u2019\u201d\u201cAh, really? Uhm\u2026 this should be quick then.\u201dHalf-sitting on her chair, Lucy began to explain as if it were nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s what Glockt, the archmage, defined\u2026 The three qualities of an archmage who seeks truth. Magic resonance, quick and accurate judgment, and the will to explore. You wanted to check if we had these qualities, right?\u201dThe name that was written the largest in all magic history textbooks was that of the archmage Glockt. The qualities of an archmage he defined were quite well-known.\u201cUhmm\u2026 I was just taking a nap nearby and when I woke up, the sun was already setting... So I just gathered the magic marbles that I could sense around me.\u201dThe students began to lose interest as Lucy mumbled on. However, Professor Glast was still waiting patiently for her to finish.\u201cOf course, no one else could have located that marble except for me.\u201dHer words sounded arrogant, but the way she said it couldn\u2019t be considered as such.The tone she used to explain was nothing but reciting an obvious \u2018fact\u2019, like the sun rising in the east or a glass cup breaking if it fell to the ground. She stated her words as if it was nothing special.As she continued to elaborate through her drowsiness, the other students felt a sense of incompatibility.A genius.Someone that can\u2019t be explained logically.Lucy Mayreel was someone who was born with innate talent.And those like her would surely manifest their unique prowess.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: 6 Days Before School Starts (2)Silvenia Academy\u2019s royal accommodations were located in the western part of Acken Island. Amongst them was one perched at the edge of a cliff closest to the coast.It was quite far away from the commercial district in the southwest, where various amenities and small business facilities were located.When it came to academics, the royal family were treated as equals to other students, but they cannot be treated the same when it came to their lifestyle and residences.This was the reason a royal accommodation was built solely for Princess Penia.The grand mansion was quite spacious. Regular students weren\u2019t even allowed to enter its garden, attesting to how much special treatment the royal family received in the academy.\u201cIt\u2019s very different from the academic district.\u201dThe sun was setting. Looking out the window, there was a vast view of the ocean.The subtle sound of the waves could be heard from the windowsill, filling up the entirety of the princess's enormous private quarters.Princess Penia sat at her desk as she watched the sunset from her window. It was a personal desk made from high-quality wood, engraved with intricate patterns. It was even larger than Headmaster Obel's own desk.In every way, the royal family's life had to always be one of extreme opulence.It was a life completely different from that of a regular student in the academic district.Princess Penia swept her neat platinum blonde hair in front of her left shoulder.She opened her magic history and Elemental book but soon put her pen down.\u201c......\u201dThe princess was lost in thought.The golden marble that Lucy Mayreel showed during the Class Assignment Examination announcement was definitely the marble she found inside The Guardian Tree of Merilda.She came to a realization.The marble looked unique, but there was nothing strange about it other than that. You could barely feel the magic power inside of it because it was so weak.Indeed, Princess Penia\u2019s judgment was correct.The marble really was nothing more than a marble with a unique appearance and a small amount of magic power.However, the fact that it was \u2018filled with weak magic power\u2019 was the key itself.\u201cNot bad, Ms. Lucy.\u201dThe three qualities of an archmage who covets the truth as the archmage Glockt defined:Magic resonanceQuick and accurate judgmentThe will to exploreThe students who jumped to the conclusion that the test was judged on a \u2018first come, first serve\u2019 basis were deducted points in the 'quick and accurate judgment' aspect.What determined the top performers was those who did well in 'magic power resonance', judged by the amount of magic power in each marble.The smaller the amount, the harder they were to detect.Now that Princess Penia thought back on it, there were different amounts of magic power in each of the various marbles that were spread out.But the difference was so minimal that it was difficult to even notice if the princess hadn't focused.The more marbles found with less magic power inside, the more extra points in the \u2018magic power resonance\u2019 aspect.And the golden marble that Lucy Mayreel casually found after she woke up from her nap\u2026\u201cThe Guardian Tree of Merilda is the oldest tree in the northern forest. It's a tree protected by Merilda, a high-ranking wind spirit, so it's always surrounded by abundant magic.\u201dProfessor Glast said at the podium, talking with his unique skull-like face.\u201cIn a small space where there is an abundance of magic power present, I placed a marble with the smallest amount of magic power infused into it. Even the location was just a rock island in the middle of a lake. Unless you were a student who was able to sense that minuscule magic power, it was a place that you wouldn\u2019t have found.\u201dThere was no end to the intricacies of magic power resonance.The same way a person's scent would be impossible to distinguish in a crowd, it was harder to notice unique magic power when mixed or buried among others.Lucy Mayreel was born with the ability to push her magic power resonance to the limit.Not only that, she was dozing off, acting like she didn\u2019t know anything\u2026 when she actually understood Professor Glast\u2019s intentions already.Evident in the fact that she came back to the academic district with nothing more than that golden marble.It meant Lucy Mayreel was already on top of the field.\u201cAlright, I can understand that\u2026\u201dIt was the first time the princess heard the name Lucy Mayreel. However, it turned out she was already quite well known amongst the others.\u201cLazy Lucy.\u201dShe could be seen around campus curled up on benches, tree stumps, or even on the grass field taking a nap.Her origins were unknown, but it was rumored she was already a genius, able to push her sense of magic power to the limit.It was a truly enviable talent, but it\u2019s a talent that she was born with. It's something that could just be accepted as unfair.But there was still a part she couldn\u2019t understand.There was one more person who knew where the marble was.\u201cThat tree is 'The Guardian Tree of Merilda\u2019. If you look inside the tree, you're bound to have a good harvest.\u201dEd Rothstaylor.Princess Penia felt deeply troubled.This meant he also knew the location of the golden marble, something that couldn't be explained as an accidental discovery.The marble only held a small amount of magic power, in a space surrounded by powerful magic power from The Guardian Tree of Merilda. It was also located on a rocky island in the middle of a lake. It\u2019s not a place that one can find on accident while walking about.Therefore, there was only one conclusion to be drawn. Ed Rothstaylor was born with the same level of magic sensitivity as Lucy Mayreel.\u201cLet go of me! Do you know who I am?! I am Ed Rothstaylor, the second son of the Rothstaylor family! Get your dirty hands off me, you pigs! Where do you think you are touching me?!\u201d\u201cYou think I would stoop so low just to mess with a nobody failure like Taylee? Let go of me! These dirty and ignorant commoners! Do you even know what you're talking about!\u201d\u201cWhat? P-Princess? The Benevolent Princess Penia? I\u2019m s-sorry, I didn\u2019t notice you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Princess! I\u2019ll punish myself and hit my head like this! Please! Please show your mercy!\u201d\u201cPrincess! If you defend bugs like Taylee, your noble and high name will be tarnished. Please condemn him!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201dPrincess Penia shook her head.Ever since she could remember, she had lived judging others.The disgraceful appearance that Ed Rothstaylor exhibited at the entrance exam was something anyone would recognize as a last-ditch effort of someone backed to a corner.The princess heard that his magical abilities were nothing exceptional. Rather, it was a mystery why he was so arrogant when he had nothing to boast about. It was probably because of the Rothstaylor family's unique training method.But more than that, Professor Glast wouldn\u2019t have left him alone if he had that much talent.The professor was someone who was madly obsessed with talent, so much so that he would find hidden talents among students and help them bloom.There was no way the professor wouldn't have noticed his level of talent.However, the uncomfortable feeling persisted in Princess Penia.\u201cWas he really the same person?\u201dThere wasn't a sense of relief or that of convincing. More than anything, there was something about that calm side of Ed Rothstaylor in the forest\u2026His shameful attitude, trembling in fear and unable to hide his sense of awe in the face of power, of becoming weak in front of someone powerful\u2013she didn't feel it at all.\u00a0 She thought he was bluffing at first, but seeing his actions changed her mind.Ed Rothstaylor seemed more concerned about the campfire extinguishing rather than the angry Princess Penia in front of him.He sat by the campfire and talked, kindling the firewood with his poker. He didn't look at the princess even once.She felt a sense of discomfort.A sense of discomfort from the fact that this might not be the same person.But the appearance and behavior he exhibited as an arrogant aristocrat that Princess Penia saw at the entrance exam\u2013that was real.\u201cWas there a chance that he just changed?\u201dThe biggest chance for him to change was probably after being disowned.But even when she thought about it, it seemed too strange.She was the reason Ed Rothstaylor was disowned.He should have either blamed her or begged her for forgiveness. If he did, the princess wouldn't be feeling this strange unease.However, this new Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s eyes held no such unjust feelings.The eyes that Princess Penia had seen\u2013Indifference. Apathy.A good impression.He even appeared to be relaxed.The fact that these were the feelings in the eyes of someone who had just been thrown away by aristocracy\u2026 The princess thought it was unrealistic.\"No way\u2026 was he not in shock over what happened to him?\"No, Princess Penia shook her head. He lived as a member of the Rothstaylor family his whole life. No matter how calm and composed of a person he may be, there was no way being disowned from the comfortable life he had been living thus far wouldn\u2019t be shocking.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dClosing her magic book, Princess Penia fell deep into her thoughts.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *What kind of family were the Rothstaylors?The person to come to mind would be Krepin Rothstaylor, whom the princess first met at a royal banquet.He was a wonderful nobleman with a warm-hearted smile, dressed neatly and was stylish in appearance.But that was through the eyes of the young Princess Penia.Because her 'Insightful Eyes', which were gifted by God like a sixth sense, gave her the ability to measure a person\u2019s being, and they saw something different.Inside the benevolent noble head of the house, Krepin Rothstaylor had something that the princess couldn't explain well with words. A black and unpleasant snake living in the pit of his stomach.Behind the perfect example of a kind ruler was something hiding in the shadows.Every once in a while, the princess would notice his face darken as he leaves the royal conference hall.He was a villain wearing the mask of an innocent nobleman. Princess Penia had been sure about this for a long time.There were even private troops secretly sent to investigate the family, seemingly hiding a darkness that no one knew.There was a rumor that items would occasionally go missing at the annual Royal Treasury meeting, only to turn up later.There was also a rumor that a staff member who worked at the family\u2019s mansion went missing.And a rumor that Krepin Rothstaylor indulged in books about the 'God of Destruction\u2019.Something suspicious was going on.However, the basis for this speculation was not enough.\u201c......\u201dPrincess Penia suddenly stopped fiddling with her pen.Her Insightful Eyes that measured a person had never been wrong in her entire life.No matter how unusual it may be, if her sixth sense was going haywire, then there must be something going on.But this was only a hypothetical 'what if '.Even though her sixth sense could sense it, the Rothstaylor family's misdeeds were yet to be revealed.What if Ed Rothstaylor was trying to leave that darkness?It would explain how he could remain so calm despite being disowned by his own family.It's because he was trying to naturally cut off his ties from said family.However, it wasn't easy to leave the blood lineage of the aristocracy. If he wanted to be disowned naturally, he would have to leave behind a destroyed reputation.\u201c......\u201dPrincess Penia\u2019s face stiffened at the realizationMore than anything, if this was true\u2026\u201cLet go of me! Do you know who I am?! I am Ed Rothstaylor, the second son of the Rothstaylor family! Get your dirty hands off me, you pigs! Where do you think you are touching me?!\u201d\u201cYou think I would stoop so low just to mess with a nobody failure like Taylee? Let go of me! These dirty and ignorant commoners! Do you even know what you're talking about!\u201dThen even that ugliness he showed, that worst part of human nature he exhibited during the entrance examination\u2026 That meant it was all acting.This meant he had a different type of inner strength that even her Insightful Eyes couldn't see.In other words, he was a mastermind manipulator who even used the princess of the kingdom for his own purpose.\u201cThat was\u2026 all acting\u2026?\u201dThe princess quickly shook her head no. That can\u2019t be true.However, the change in Ed Rothstaylor constantly bothered Princess Penia.If what she saw was acting.If he knew something about the darkness of the Rothstaylor family.If he used the princess to cut ties with that darkness.If all of this was planned in the palm of his hand.If that\u2019s true\u2026Slam!\u201cThis is too exhausting.\u201dThe princess pushed herself up from the table.She went to the window and was greeted by the cool sea breeze, her platinum blonde hair refreshingly flying in the wind.The feeling helped cool her head.\u201cI should catch up on the admission schedule and my studies, I can't afford to pay attention to state affairs.\u201dGo enjoy the happiness of learning. That was the encouragement the King gave her when she left for the academy.She had been able to shed and escape some of the rules and mannerisms of being royalty in Silvenia, a place for her to study. She should let go of these thoughts now.A life full of politics, power struggles between aristocrats, caring for the people, and diplomacy with international nations\u2026The princess was starting to get tired of it all.Maybe she was already tired.She was just overestimating Ed Rothstaylor.Not everyone lived their life hidden inside layers of masks.Perhaps this had become a bad habit for the princess, measuring a person due to living life walking a tightrope amongst aristocrats and ministers.Physically, Princess Penia was just a foolish girl who was yet to have her coming of age ceremony. But her heartfelt as though it had become old.Besides, she wasn't even at the age that she should be measuring others, but rather at a time when she should be focusing on herself.The princess sighed as the wind whistled by.\u201cDid I mature too early for my age?\u201dShe looked at the mirror by the window.A beautiful platinum blonde princess who grew up well-cared for stood in the mirror wearing light sleepwear.She gathered her hair and rolled it up, then she tried splitting it in the middle and tying her hair in pigtails, and then she tried tying everything to one side.But by then, she let out a big sigh and let go of her hair.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I'm not interested in dressing up, but I don\u2019t know why I get so embarrassed about it.\u201dAuthority sometimes bound a person. Since she was in a position of authority, the fatigue was indescribable.But it couldn\u2019t be helped. To some people, the princess\u2019s position looked like a blessing.\u201cI\u2019m always thinking too deeply and too hard about everything\u2026 It might have become a bad habit.\u201dPrincess Penia still kept thinking as she stood by the window, feeling the wind. She stood there thinking about Ed Rothstaylor.Knowing the dark secret of the Rothstaylor family, he deliberately used the princess to get himself disowned and break ties with his family.The assumption was too absurd.It made sense if she were to stitch together various pieces but\u2026 it was too much of a leap in terms of logic.But his attitude had strangely changed and did a 180\u00b0.\u201cLet\u2019s just think he went crazy because he got disowned.\u201dHe also found the location of the golden marble before Lucy Mayreel and told Princess Penia\u2026\u201cThat is\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 He must have found it by chance.\u201dOn the contrary, it felt too convenient. Princess Penia was aware of that fact, but she also felt relieved, having had reasoned it out for herself.\u201cWhen we had a conversation before, I didn\u2019t feel anything dark from inside of him\u2026\u201dPrincess Penia\u2019s face froze.The conversation she had with him in the northern forest.She forgot how natural their conversation flowed.As soon as she saw him, she immediately snapped at him.Get out of this school! People here despise you. Don\u2019t you also despite this school as well? Don\u2019t you hate me for getting you disowned?How did Ed Rothstaylor respond to that?With a surprised reaction, he stared at Princess Penia and said a reason that nobody would believe\u2013\u201cThe truth is, princess, I actually feel grateful towards you.\u201dStuck in such a bizarre situation, she couldn\u2019t ask the significance behind those words.Just what was he thankful for?Princess Penia was the person who had the biggest influence in getting him excommunicated.Just what was there to be thankful for to such an enemy?Was getting disowned something to be thankful for?\u201c......\u201dSlowly, Princess Penia stopped.Crackle!She could hear the occasional crackling of the campfire, as if experiencing an auditory hallucination.There wasn't a lot the princess saw that day.The only thing she saw was the wide back of a boy rekindling firewood with his poker, as if he was enjoying what he was doing.* * *Fwoosh!\u201cI caught it!!!\u201dIt was my seventh catch.The fishing rod I made in a hurry was performing better than I thought. The freshwater fish I just caught looked similar to bluegill and was already my seventh catch.With this much, it wouldn't only be to stave off my hunger, but it should be enough to eat until I\u2019m full.I was always hungry, but after coming to this terrible world for the first time, it looked like I might finally be able to feel 'satisfied'.So satisfied that I couldn\u2019t help but give a thumbs up.\u201cWhat a great catch!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: 3 Days Before School Starts (1)Hearing the cicadas chirping among the grass was nice.The moonlight reflected on the water at night creates a relaxing atmosphere.I was cleaning the fish I caught in front of the crackling campfire.I worked a lot the past three days just to survive.My once shabby living space had become quite decent.First was my shelter, which was made with wood, clothes, and leaves. I had now reinforced it with clay from the river, filling the gaps connecting the support beams and making them sturdier. The gaps on the roof were also neatly covered. Even if it rained, there probably won't be any leakage.However, the support didn't look like it could withstand the added weight of the clay. I had to reinforce it with more wood, adding volume to my shelter.And as for food, I found rock salt downstream of the river leading up to the coast. I then ground some fragments into smaller pieces and used it to season my food. I also found a large flat stone by the river and used it as a grill.\u201cI\u2019m slowly getting the hang of it.\u201dI couldn't catch bigger fish with just a low-grade fishing rod. Usually, I would only catch small fish like Japanese rice fish, but sometimes I would reel in a Bluegill fish that I could actually eat.I had also become quite good at preparing fish.Using the ceremonial dagger that had now become my trusty companion, I cut through the fish belly and removed its guts. After that, I dragged the blade across the skin to descale it, and then scored through the flesh to let the seasoning seep well into the meat. I then sprinkled salt all over it and grilled it on the stone plate.[Newly Made Dish]Grilled Bluegill with SaltBluegill caught in the river that was cleaned and then grilled with salt.It\u2019s simple but the tastes of the ingredients are incorporated well together.Production Difficulty Level:\u00a0\u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Cooking skills have increased. \u300bOh, I obtained something new.There weren't any messages like this when I only caught and roughly grilled my fish.But ever since I started cleaning and preparing the ingredients, seasoning and cooking them properly, my cooking skill began to improve.This meant the increase in my daily life production skills reflected on my level as well. I took my mirror out and looked at my reflection to check my information window.[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 3Intelligence: 4Dexterity: 8Willpower: 7Luck: 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226bMy Dexterity increased by a point from 7 to 8.Proficiency in various daily life production skills was extremely important in \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster.\u2019This was because skills in cooking, construction, woodworking, pharmaceutical, and other production areas could create a variety of useful items, but were also useful when combined with practical combat abilities.As an example, Dexterity was closely connected with a person's sensitivity. It had something to do with being able to detect the subtle flow of energies or movements around you.It had little relation to magic, but it brought a significant differences in swordsmanship, archery, and alchemy.I didn't know when my Dexterity increased but a point was already a great feat.The higher your stats were, the harder it became to raise them.Although it may not take long to raise low stats like 3 or 4 to a 7 or 8, you would need to complete a legendary quest just to earn a point once you reach the 20s.Most of the daily life production skills were closely linked to Dexterity.Combat Skills were affected by Vitality, Dexterity, and Willpower.Magic Skills were influenced by Intelligence, Willpower, and Luck.Life Skills were from Dexterity and Willpower.While Alchemy Skills needed Intelligence and Luck.It may seem unnecessarily complicated, but the key thing to remember was that each skill was affected by different stats.I tasted a piece of fish. As it was seasoned well, it was really delicious,I drank a few gulps of water from the stream and sat down on a large rock I've been using as a substitute for a chair.\u201cI still have a lot of work to do\u2026\u201dThe wooden shelter was uncomfortable at first, but it somehow became cozy as the days went by.I still had a lot of extra clothes left.When it came to food, I had somehow survived by catching fish and foraging nuts and berries from the forest.I wouldn't say my standard of living is high, but it sure could improve little by little.\u201cI need a drying rack to wash my clothes, but how do I make something like that\u2026 If I go to the library in the academic district, wouldn't I find some related books about it? And I don\u2019t want to only rely on fishing and gathering, I want to hunt too.\u201dWhile walking around in the forest yesterday, I chanced upon a wild boar roaming around. Apart from it, there were also plenty of wild animals such as rabbits and squirrels.Since the academy had to be built on Acken Island, a large-scale monster subjugation took place first. It would be hard to find monsters that could count as a threat to human life now, but there were quite a few wild animals that lived in the forests, naturally belonging in nature.Hunting wouldn't be a choice, but a necessity. Meat was about supply and demand, but if I were to collect oil from the animal I caught, the quality of my cooking would greatly increase.\u201cCome to think of it, I need some cooking utensils\u2026\u201dThe tools I had were all ceremonial items used at academic events\u2013a ceremonial dagger, an iron bowl, and a mirror. These things were usually kept neatly, but at this point, I didn\u2019t have the leisure to pay attention to such empty formalities.The ceremonial dagger had already gone through all sorts of hardships, and there was no reason to keep the bowl and mirror neat. It was something that couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201cIt\u2019d be so convenient if I just had something like a pot, a proper kitchen knife, a ladle, or at least a plate for the food.\u201dUsing a twig, I wrote down the necessary items I could think of on the ground. I didn't have money and couldn't leave the island right away, but if I were somehow able to obtain the funds, these were the things I really wanted to buy.\u201cI still have so many things left to do\u2026 But there are only three days left before school starts\u2026 ughh\u2026\u201dI let out a deep sigh and stretched.At least I had enough tools to live with.This past week, I worked hard to build a place I could call my own. It could now be considered something like a \u2018camp.\u2019The wooden shelter that I put my most effort into.A campfire surrounded by small rocks to manage it efficiently.On top of that, a large stone plate that I used in place of a cooking grill.Along with these things was the neatly arranged luggage I brought from Ophelis Hall.There were also quite a few other items I made by myself that I had organized separately.\u201cThen for today\u2026 let\u2019s try making a bow using some silk threads.\u201dThe silk I found in my luggage had been a huge help. It looked like a luxury product that I almost shed tears as I unraveled the fabric. The fishing line was made with that silk, and I also used it to tie and close the fabric on my roof.The silk was of high quality and was quite durable. If I twist it well, it would be usable in a bow. I also found an appropriately sized piece of wood in the forest for the bow itself.Making and learning how to use a bow would be a huge help.Most importantly, archery had good compatibility with both magic and Dexterity.That was because various magical modifications could be applied to the arrows, greatly increasing their power.If I could increase my proficiency with a bow and arrow, I would see a direct growth in my abilities.Based on my experience, hastily learning a skill resulted in inferior proficiency. It was easy to fall out of balance.Prevention was better than cure. No matter how busy I may be, I needed to make sure I did all the necessary preparations first.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be another long night.\u201dShrugging my shoulders, I got myself ready to go back into production mode. I guessed I would be sleeping late today once again.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Dean McDowell smiled contentedly as he swept his mustache. It had been a while since he laughed like this.The position as Dean of the Magic Department at Silvenia Academy was hard and difficult to endure for a gentle soul like him.There were many eccentric students that dominated the academy, but even the professors had big egos. Trying to mediate in the middle of it all, getting swept here and there, had made his once-shiny black hair start turning white.The deans of the Combat Department and Alchemy Department didn't seem to suffer nearly as much. It looked to be that the Magic Department was just particularly difficult.But there were times when he felt like he was being rewarded.He smiled as he looked through the results of the freshmen class assignment.The lineup this year was truly a gold mine.Even though he had become old, the brilliant glow of these talented gemstones made his heart flutter.First of all, it was a good sign that Professor Glast assigned three students to Class A.Professor Glast, who shakes his head, not only at students but even at high-ranking professors, recognized as many as three students.\u2018Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019 whose talents had blossomed even in the harsh northern grasslands.The greatest merchant in the continent that led the Elte Company, \u2018The Golden King\u2019 Elte Kehelland\u2019s only child, \u2018The Golden Daughter Lortel.\u2019And the one whose origins and past was unknown\u2026 The girl who made Professor Glast applaud with just her overwhelming talent \u2013 \u2018Lazy Lucy.\u2019Dean McDowell couldn\u2019t help but be surprised at Professor Glast\u2019s praise for Lucy Mayreel.\u201cShe was born with the qualities of an archmage who will make a new mark in the history of magic. I am honored to be her teacher.\u201dTaking into consideration how Professor Glast had looked at many magicians who had been called prodigies before with cold and distant eyes, and looking at his words and actions now, Dean McDowell couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what kind of talent Lucy Mayreel had.Compared to last year, this year\u2019s freshmen were a great harvest.There were barely any students who stood out from last year's freshmen. Only Yeneka, who succeeded in signing a contract with a high-ranking spirit, caught his attention.Rather, their average scores were on the decline. They even had a student who was excommunicated for interfering with this year's freshmen entrance exam. It was a batch of students that could be considered the worst generation.\u201cLast year must have been really grim for the sake of this year.\u201dMcDowell was about to sign the report, hoping that Silvenia\u2019s great name could be raised once again.\u201cDean. Please wait a moment\u2026 A guest has arrived.\u201dHis secretary knocked on his office door. He had told her not to let anyone in unless they had scheduled a meeting in advance, but it seemed as if she had already forgotten.McDowell sighed and was about to reprimand her when the door swung open without his approval.It was Claire, the royal knight, and Head Escort under the direct control of Princess Penia. With the door open, the princess herself came in, dressed in a dark blue dress.Dean McDowell was scared out of his wits. He bowed his head and tried to honor the royal family, only to quickly stop himself.This was the academic district in Silvenia.It was a place where the virtue of learning took precedence over the status of nobles.Outside of the academic district, there would be people bowing their heads in front of the authority of the royal family. But here, Dean McDowell was considered Princess Penia\u2019s professor.He couldn't treat the princess carelessly, but he had to at least act as a teacher and treat her as a student. This was the policy of the emperor who founded Silvenia Academy.Dean McDowell ended his courtesy by carefully bowing his head.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the Princess has traveled all the way to the academic district at this hour. And for what reason did you come, princess?\u201d\u201cI am sorry I didn\u2019t contact you in advance, Professor McDowell.\u201dDespite her petite frame, Princess Penia faced him with an intimidating aura. She modestly sat down on the sofa meant for guests while the Head Escort Claire and the two other royal knights stood firm.\u201cThere\u2019s something I wanted to discuss. Will that be okay?\u201dThe Benevolent Princess Penia was not one to use her authority to pressure others. McDowell knew about that fact quite well.So what could her reason be for recklessly coming into his office to ask him for a discussion?Either way, Dean McDowell had no choice but to listen to what she had to say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: The Day Before School Starts (1)\u201cNow\u2026 What should I do\u2026\u201dIn the middle of a small lake in the southeastern part of the forest is a rocky island where \u2018The Guardian Tree of Merilda\u2019 stands.I found the Elementalist Yennekar lost in thought there, concentrating while leaning against the tree.Before I knew it, the start of school was only a day away.I needed to prepare a lot of things. First of which was my unsightly appearance.Spending ten days in the wild, I looked more like a commoner than I did a noble. Although I did wash in the stream every day, I still needed to shave off my sparsely growing beard.I sharpened the edge of a hinge I removed from my suitcase, scared of actually using it. If I accidentally cut myself with a rusty blade, I could get an infection like tetanus.However, to maintain a lowkey academic life at Silvenia, maintaining my dignity was the most basic of basics. My goal was to graduate and remain unnoticed as much as possible. There would be nothing worse than catching the attention of the academic staff for looking like a beggar.I would need to find a way to get a clean razor blade.I got dressed and finished my other preparations for school before finally picking up my bow.[ Combat Skills Details ]Grade: Combat BeginnerSpecialized Fields: BowBow Proficiency: Level 1Without hesitation, I decided to specialize in bow mastery for my Combat Skills.There are four skill categories in \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019:Combat, Magic, Life, and Alchemy.It was a system that decides one\u2019s profession by combining two skill categories.Specializing in combat and magic would enable a student to become a magic swordsman or a magic fighter.Specializing in magic and alchemy would enable a student to become an alchemist or a spiritualist.For a player who is in a position to freely choose their profession, it would be wise to consider their options. But in my case, I was left with no choice for my two skill categories.I had to train my Life Skills in order to survive.I was also in possession of a student\u2019s body from the Magic Department, making magic training inevitable.In other words, specializing in Magic and Life Skills wasn\u2019t an option, but a necessity.These two categories weren't a good combination, but there was a possibility of becoming a magic engineer or an enchanter.As I said, there was no weapon I was as compatible with as the bow.It would be hard for me to engage in close combat because I lack endurance, muscle strength, and fast reflexes. Attacking enemies from a distance would be the most ideal strategy.When my proficiency with production skills improved, I would be able to craft high-quality arrows and enchant them with magic.Due to this, the best course of action was for me to specialize in bow mastery for my Combat Skills and specialize in elementalism for my Alchemy Skills.\u201cElementalism\u2026\u201dHowever, Elementalists were born with an innate ability called spirit resonance.There was a limit to what one can train to interact with spirits. Therefore, historically great Elementalists had all been born with this innate ability.\u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped if it doesn\u2019t work\u2026 but that would be a bummer.\u201dThere weren\u2019t many good specializations for Alchemy Skills. The most I could think of was specializing in herbal medicines.Even then, it would be impossible to force Spirit Resonance if I didn\u2019t have it. If it were not to work out, I would just have to find another way.\u201cAnyway, I need to try out this bow I made all night.\u201dI was overjoyed when I finished crafting a bow with a production difficulty level as high as level 2, but I was still skeptical if it would work or not.I sharpened the hinges of my suitcases and attached them to wooden sticks to make an arrow. I used all the hinges to make four. But if I were to be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able to kill anything with them.They might be useless against large beasts like wild boars, but they might work against smaller animals like squirrels and rabbits.With the bow on my back, I went out to hunt.Two hours later, after having achieved the result of two squirrels, I found Yennekar at \u2018The Guardian Tree of Merilda\u2019.At the youngest age, she was able to sign a contract with Takan, a high-ranking fire spirit. She was a talented Elementalist currently attending Silvenia Academy as a second year student.She would later on be controlled by the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper, the right hand of the highest-ranking dark spirit Glasskan. She would then take over the entire student center.She was \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019s\u2019 final boss in the first act.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Without any ambition, I just wanted to graduate from this academy. That was my best course of action.But truth be told, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t have any dreams.It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t want to be the hero of this world and walk a path of praise from everyone.However, the path a hero would walk on was usually a thorny one.There was a reason they received praises. It was because they silently pressed forward on the thorny path where blood flowed, just as if it was a flower road.The same goes for this word\u2019s hero, Taylee. No one knows who he was yet, or where he was or what he\u2019s doing.But I\u2019ve played countless times as Taylee, so I knew it all too well.With a total of 5 acts and 43 chapters, the story was similar to that of an epic novel. The ordeal that the main character Taylee would go through was not something a weak feeble mind could endure.What awaits at the end of his romantic and youthful academy life was the countless suffering of death and formidable and overwhelming enemies.His last semester would be where the scale of his ordeals would increase drastically, with constant threats and pressure on Taylee\u2019s personal affairs.The pleasure and triumph of overcoming them may be sweet, but I didn\u2019t want to go through all of those. Above all, overcoming them didn\u2019t always mean that a great reward was waiting.Honor and glory were valuable things, but they never came for free. Instead, a lot of sacrifices had to be made in the process.To know that the path in front was a thorny one, it would be stupid to willingly walk on it.That was my conclusion.Whatever it may be, I would follow the \u2018authentic path.\u2019The path of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 that I knew.One way or another, Taylee, who had been through all kinds of ordeals and tests, would solve all the crises on his own.I would just tell him he was doing a good job and clap for him while I focus on taking care of myself and getting my diploma.And besides, I was one year his senior.The storyline of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 would get fiercer around the last year when Taylee was about to graduate. This was also the climax of the storyline.It was when all kinds of forces outside the academy were in full swing, students were threatened and the atmosphere became desolate. All the students were met with various hardships.The year before that, I just needed to get my diploma and leave.My strategy was to take all the benefits and go find my own life while I leave all the difficulties to the protagonist.Wasn\u2019t that the perfect plan?As for this situation\u2026One of the most important characters in the game and the first person to take Taylee down\u2013Yennekar Palerover.I didn\u2019t want to get involved so I should just go on my way.That was the reasonable course of action.But just as I was about to leave,\u201cOh my, isn\u2019t that the funny friend Merilda mentioned?\u201dYennekar opened her eyes and spoke to me.Of course, this was my life, where rarely anything ever goes the way I wanted.* * *\u201cThe entirety of this forest is Merilda\u2019s territory. And although she\u2019s not a very high-ranking spirit, she talks about everything on her mind.\u201dShe talked as if the old high-ranking wind spirit that had been protecting this forest even before Silvenia Academy was established was her friend.Her plentiful light pink hair was brushed down well, and both sides of her hair were neatly braided, giving off a warm impression.She was dressed in the standard uniform at Silvenia Academy, a red coat and navy blue skirt. But perhaps, since it was cold, she had a fluffy shawl wrapped around her shoulders.Spread around her were a couple of magic books. She must have been reading while being surrounded by the trees in the forest.\u201cI just arrived back at the dorm after the break, but why do I have so many things to say\u2026 I\u2019m admired for having a high-ranking spirit, but I guess I've been lonely without someone to talk to. I don\u2019t know how I survived the break, being so bored.\u201dShe smiled and kept chatting, but from my point of view, this was a dilemma.Because I didn\u2019t want to get involved with her.I had to do something when it was with Princess Penia as she was directly related to my situation, but this is a completely different story.\u201cI guess it can be lonely for anyone, not having someone to talk to.\u201dShe looks so cozy and sweet with her bright smile, which is why it came as a big shock to players in the first act when she was revealed as the main antagonist.A reliable and warm second-year senior, and yet she took over the student center with the cursed seal of Glasskan all over her body.It was a slap to the back of the head for players who were just starting to adapt to the rules of the world.In fact, it was the point where I got immersed in the story. I couldn\u2019t help but say \u2018What the shit\u2013\u2019 when I played through that part.So\u2026Why was she talking to me?Somehow, I felt like I could answer that question myself.\u201cI heard you were living in this forest? After being excommunicated?\u201d\u201cThe owner of this forest told you that?\u201d\u201cMerilda is a bit nosy. She loves this forest after all.\u201dWith a smile on her face, it seemed like blooming flowers were flying around her. She looked like someone who was always positive no matter how bad the situation may be.The gap in appearance from how she looked now to when she would take over the student hall made me feel uncomfortable.\u201cShe loves this forest very much, isn\u2019t it only natural for her to know about one uninvited guest?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dI became worried about the two squirrel bodies hanging behind my back. I had also cut down a lot of trees.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about those useless things~ It\u2019s the providence of nature that the living is to catch and eat each other. Would Merilda be uncomfortable with just that?\u201d\u201cI guess even a scary-looking giant wolf has a soft heart.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unexpected right? Hahaha!\u201dMerilda, who protects the forest, was a high-ranking wind spirit in the form of a giant wolf. From what I could remember, she didn\u2019t usually appear in front of humans. I guess she was more tolerant than I had originally thought.Then it wasn\u2019t as strange that I had been setting up camp, hunting, and gathering in her forest thus far.\u201cYour appearance changed a lot. Hmm\u2026 The Ed from last semester was more\u2026 We haven\u2019t talked a lot but how should I say this\u2026 Your voice sounded a bit more \u2018whiny\u2019, but now it\u2019s more serious. Was it an image change?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cAha! I feel the same. The Ophelis Hall maid braided both sides of my hair. What do you think? Do I look more tomboyish?\u201dI couldn\u2019t respond as she twisted her hair.I wanted to commend her for cheerfully talking with Ed Rothstaylor, who was known as the biggest jerk in the world but\u2026Knowing her future, I couldn\u2019t respond with a cheerful smile.Well, if I wanted to keep my distance, that would be easy.I know a 'magic spell' that would make anyone nervous and suspicious of me, no matter their saintly personality or how nice of a person they may be.\u201cYennekar, it must have been fate that we met the day before school started. May I ask you for a favor?\u201d\u201cA favor?\u201d\u201cRecently, I\u2019m in urgent need of money, so I have been looking for a place where I can borrow.\u201dI naturally cast the magic spell.\u201cCan you give me a guarantee?\u201dAnd cut\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: The Day Before School Starts (2)Thanks to how my parents educated and raised me when I was young, just hearing the word 'guarantee' always sent a shiver down my spine and caused my blood pressure to rise.But that was just me.Either way, the desperation of a human being cornered was more burdensome than one can imagine.\u201cAfter getting disowned and becoming penniless, I guess I needed some emergency funds.\u201dIt could only be burdensome to suddenly hear such words from a classmate she wasn't even close with. But it wasn't like I didn't know that. Rather, that was exactly why I said that.\u201cOr could you lend me some money?\u201dI asked her.\u201cI see\u2026!\u201dBut Yennekar\u2019s kindness was more incredible than I had imagined.\u201cThat must have been difficult\u2026!\u201dFrom her kindness to her \u2018sympathy\u2019, I couldn't help but admire her.\u201cThere must have been a lot of hardships that I was unaware of\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what I can say to help you feel better but\u2026 I hope you can cheer up!\u201dHer cheerfulness without a lick of malice made me suspicious. Did she not know who Ed Rothstaylor was?He was a person not even worthy of empty compliments. However, Yennekar\u2019s kindness even went above that.\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m also not in a good position myself\u2026 If I could, I would definitely help you, but my family doesn\u2019t have the best circumstances either\u2026\u201dYennekar was the daughter of a small ranch in the eastern part of the kingdom of Sparde. She wasn\u2019t born into a rich family. Rather, she grew up playing in the fields as a commoner.The only reason she was able to attend such a prestigious academy was due to her incredible spirit resonance. Due to her capabilities, she had good grades and received a scholarship.\u201cBut cheer up! I\u2019ll be cheering for you!\u201dHer beautiful smile was her trademark. Seeing it had the ability to warm one's heart.But knowing what was in store for her\u2026 it wasn't pleasant.* * *At the place where Ed Rothstaylor had just left, sat a girl still reaching out towards the air.\u201cIt's just as you said Merilda, he\u2019s such a strange person.\u201dThere were only three people at Silvenia Academy with a high enough spirit resonance that allowed them to see the high-ranking wind spirit Merilda.The second year student, Yennekar Palerover.\u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019 who was talented in all different fields of magic.And Melina, a senior professor of Spiritual Studies.\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like this last year.\u201dA gust of wind blew as she stretched her arms out. Suddenly, there stood a giant wolf entwined with the wind.The wolf opened her mouth with a large amount of pressure and rubbed her face against Yennekar's hand while letting out a soft growl.Yennekar grinned as she stroked the wolf's jaw, which was several dozen times bigger than herself.\u201cI hope I can sign a contract with you one day, Merilda.\u201dEven though they were already like family, Yennekar's magic power was still too weak to sign a contract with Merilda. Although she was able to recently succeed in signing a contract with the high-ranking fire spirit Takan, Yennekar had to lie down for ten days and ten nights right after, suffering from a high fever.\u201cYou're even a wolf now\u2026 you\u2019re starting to look like the owner of the forest more and more.\u201dAs a high-ranking wind spirit, Merilda's form changed every time they met. Sometimes as a giant eagle, sometimes as a creepy crocodile, and sometimes, even as a crude wild boar.Merilda appeared as a variety of animals, but this was the first time she appeared in the shape of a wolf.Yennekar buried her face in Merilda\u2019s fluffy fur and giggled while rubbing her face.\u201cNo matter how much I think about it, I don\u2019t think he could see you.\u201dHolding onto Merilda, Yennekar began thinking.She thought of Ed Rothstaylor who was disowned for doing something disgraceful. He didn\u2019t really have a large amount of talent or magic power.Nevertheless, there was something he said that bothered her.\u201cI guess even a scary-looking giant wolf has a soft heart.\u201dHe definitely said that.He was referring to Merilda\u2019s wolf form which Yennekar only saw for the first time after returning from her break. He mentioned it so casually and matter-of-factly.\u201cWho is he?\u201dAnd the intention of his following words was clear.Acting desperate and asking to borrow some money with such a calm tone and way of speaking. It was nothing like the desperation of a person stuck in a corner.Even Yennekar, who was approachable and always seemed to only smile stupidly, had as much sense like everyone else.When Yennekar tried to get closer to him, he indirectly avoided it.\u201cWell, there are people like that too but\u2026 I'm only human.\u201dIn anger, she kicked Merilda\u2019s fur who did nothing wrong. Of course, there was no way a girl's cute kick would be able to make a scratch on Merilda\u2019s skin which was as hard as steel.\u201cI treated you as nicely as I could, but if you hit me like that, it breaks my heart\u2026 geez.\u201dShe didn't have any particular feelings like that of a confession, but it somehow felt like she got dumped for no reason, making her grumpy.\u201cWell, we will keep seeing each other in the future, so we should become closer.\u201dRubbing her face against the wolf's soft fur and tightly hugging Merilda, Yennekar smiled brightly.After all, the relationship between people was something unpredictable. She remembered when she became close to many of her classmates last year, but there seemed to be a lot more interesting students this year.Among the more interesting ones was Ed Rothstaylor. Even Merilda went so far as to refer to him as a \u2018fun person.\u2019For Yennekar, the world was always kind, like a flower field that was always full of the scent of flowers.No matter who it was, greeting someone with her bright smile would warm their heart and enable them to laugh together.No matter how nice a person was, there was always a bit of darkness somewhere in their heart. Merilda understood that.Nevertheless, she had no doubt that if she smiled brightly, their hearts would eventually open up.\u201cSchool starts tomorrow, I need to study hard again.\u201dAnd so a fellow student that caught her interest had appeared. Even that fact alone was a source of joy for Yennekar.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cShe should stop paying attention to me now, right?\u201dI sat in front of the campfire and started cleaning up my outfit, putting in a last-minute effort to create a neat but inconspicuous style.The first thing I did was comb back my golden hair as much as possible to tidy it up. Then I removed all the useless accessories from my clothes. Trimming my growing beard also made a huge difference in my appearance.The problem of tuition fees would become a reality at the end of this semester. If I were not to receive a scholarship, I would have to leave the academy immediately.This meant that I had to train as much as I could during this semester.The Magic Department\u2019s curriculum had more free time that one would think, but training would still constantly occupy my time.My magic resonance and direct elemental magic proficiency had considerably progressed over the past few days. I used them every day, after all\u2013to cut down trees, to make a fire-I continuously used them for the sake of my survival to raise my mastery through repeated use.[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Low-grade MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700 Fast Casting Level 2\u0700 Mana Sense Level 5Fire Element Magic:\u0700 Ignite Level 5Wind Element Magic:\u0700 Wind Blade Level 4My main magic's level increased quite a bit. Granted, it wasn't all that hard climbing to level 10, but this was still quite fast.There was a limit to learning magic by myself. But with school beginning, the types of magic I could learn and use would become quite diverse.My proficiency in my production skills would also naturally increase, which should significantly affect my Dexterity.My problem was combat. I had hopelessly low physical and muscle strength.I had been doing all sorts of physical work these past few days, but my stats remained unchanged. This cursed body seemed like it wasn't born with any talent for physical abilities.But I was not the type to give up when the going got tough.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like aerobic exercise to train your physical strength.\u201dAlthough, at this point, when every day was like a series of aerobic exercises, it might be nonsense to actually schedule a time to exercise.However, this was my environment. The northern forest where I lived was quite far from the academic district located in the southern part of the island.The day I was disowned, I walked aimlessly and took about half a day to get to the forest. At that time, I walked deep in thought, took a break in the middle, and then walked around the streets here and there.Even then, the distance from here to the academic district couldn\u2019t be close. What was even worse was that I had to go to school every day. In other words, I would have to run to attend classes in the early hours of the morning, every day.\u201cI can think of it as physical training.\u201dPhysical strength was the foundation for all actions. No matter how much one may technically excel or train their magic, physical strength was ultimately needed to support it.I heard that combat students had to run this much every morning, so it shouldn't be impossible for me. Even though I was from the Magic Department, I had no choice but to act as a student from the Combat Department would. This was something I didn't have the time to even protest about.Running to school every morning, gaining stats for my Combat Skills through hunting, woodworking, and other means to survive.As for my Magic Skills, I needed to constantly train my mana-sense and basic elemental magic.At the same time, crafting various things necessary for my survival would take care of my Life Skills. My increasing Dexterity and various production skills should be of great help in the future.But my Alchemy Skill\u2026 I wasn't sure yet. I didn\u2019t have any useful magic tools or alchemy supplies right now.\u201cAnyway, I need to focus on training this semester.\u201dOh please! It would be great if I could avoid attracting any useless attention. Even without that, I already had so much work to do.Please\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Face-to-Face With The Dean (1)There was a question niggling at the back of my mind.But because I had been barely surviving, it was something I didn't have the luxury to think about. However, as the new semester was just about to begin, I naturally thought of it again.Just where in the world was the protagonist Taylee and just what the hell had he been doing?* * *An atmosphere of excitement was bound to form at the start of a new semester.Most of the students had already returned to their dorms as the break had ended.Even friends who hadn't seen each other in a long time had probably already caught up with each other.But it's still human nature to feel excited at the newness of attending the yearly opening ceremony.The Student Center was located at the center of the academic district. It comprised three buildings and was more commonly referred to as the Student Center.Among them was Kate Hall which was located on the west side. It was often used for such large academy-wide eventsThere were dozens of large tables spread out in the huge auditorium, all of which were big enough to seat ten people comfortably. Each table was laden with a banquet feast. For someone who had been living on fish and plants these past few days, it looked like heaven on earth.I woke up at six in the morning and walked from the northern forest all the way south to the academic district. To endure such a feast in front of me was an ordeal at a level beyond what mere human patience could endure.If I could take the leftovers, I wouldn't have to worry about food for a while. Was there a bag or a bowl somewhere where I could put some? That was what I thought, but I didn't dare do anything more.I hated the academy's culture of nobility. Silvenia Academy liked to overly emphasize the need to \u2018maintain dignity\u2019.It would've been great if they ignored me were I to pick up the leftovers and take them with me. But I would lose points from my behavioral conduct grade if I were to get caught.\"It\u2019s great to see students who are growing even more with each semester. Also, what we discussed at Silvenia\u2019s academic affairs meeting was\u2026\"It was a given that regardless of the generation and time, the school principal's speech was bound to be boring.Although because of this strange thing they call 'dignity', the Silvenia students were all sitting straight and listening in silence. All thousands of them.It was a ridiculous sight.It was moments like these when I realized the worth of Silvenia\u2019s name.- \u201cLook over there\u2026 Isn\u2019t that Ed Rothstaylor?\u201d- \u201cWhat? The 2nd year student who behaved indecently at the freshman entrance exam?\u201d- \u201cOh my, looking closely, his appearance is a bit strange\u2026 But it\u2019s definitely him\u2026\u201d- \u201cHow could he shamelessly come to the entrance ceremony? No way, is he planning on continuing to attend school? Even though he had been disowned by his family?\u201dOf course, the all too friendly chatter about me didn't disappear at all. I sat amidst the students, hearing their honorable whispers of warm hospitality very clearly.- \u201cLook at him. Look at how much he\u2019s fallen. He\u2019s completely ruined. Ruined.\u201d- \u201cShhh, he\u2019ll hear you!\u201d- \u201cSo what if he hears? That person is no longer a noble.\u201dThey didn\u2019t have to say all those things.As slowly and as gracefully as I could, I lifted some grilled turkey and potato salad into my mouth. I shouldn't miss out on the opportunity to recharge the energy my morning run drained from me.\u201cHello!\u201dJust as I was focusing on recharging my energy, I was greeted by a lively greeting to my face.\u201cWe meet again!\u201dThere weren't many people who would brightly say hello to a fallen noble like Ed Rothstaylor.When I looked up, just as I expected, it was Yennekar Palerover, smiling and greeting me.\u201cI finished moving in with my friend at Ophelis Hall, but I couldn\u2019t say hi to you, Ed. You weren\u2019t in your room.\u201dFor a moment, I resisted the urge to frown. An alarm was ringing in my head.Be careful of her approach!Keep your distance!\u201cNothing good would come out of you talking to me.\u201d\u201cHmm? Why?\u201dI spoke with my eyes instead of my mouth. I swept my eyes around the hall to tell her to look around.There were already people gossiping about us.Yennekar Palerover was treated somewhat like a mascot amongst the 2nd years. There was no one who didn\u2019t know who she was, being the top student of our class. And because she was always lively and gave off a warm feeling towards others, she was well cherished by her friends.In addition to that, she also recently signed a contract with Takan, a high-ranking fire spirit. She was like a beacon of hope to the second years of the Magic Department.On the outside, it looked as if the innocent top student was talking to a piece of shit punk dropout. Naturally, the people around us began to look on with worry-filled eyes.In the end, there were some who urgently came and tried to rescue her.A short-haired girl with freckles and a redhead girl with long hair jumped from the crowd.\u201cWow! Yennekar! It\u2019s been a while!\u201d\u201cYennekar! Did you have a good time in your hometown?!\u201dAnyone could tell the girls were forcing the most awkward smiles as they greeted Yennekar and grabbed her arms.\u2026 Nice!Good work! My classmates whose names I didn\u2019t know\u2026!\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201dHowever, Yennekar miraculously escaped their hands and came back.\u201cI want to brag about this first before I go!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI looked at her in disbelief as she reached out her hands toward my face.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201c......?\u201dI sat still, staring at her. Yennekar had her hands clasped together, turning them here and there as she looked at them. It was as if she was stretching her hands at all sorts of angles to brag about how pale and white they were which left me confused.\u201cAfter you left yesterday, it seems to have climbed out from the lake. Isn\u2019t he so cute and adorable? I signed the contract right away. He\u2019s my new friend. Here, why don\u2019t you try touching him?\u201dI was wondering what the hell she was talking about, but hearing the word contract made me realize what she was saying.In short, it was a spirit. I couldn\u2019t tell what kind of shape it had, so I didn't know why she was bragging about it being cute. She was constantly changing the angle of her arms, as if there was something swirling around it. Anyways, I couldn\u2019t see it.Well, even though I couldn't see it, I could roughly infer how it was. After hearing all this fuss, he must be cute.If I wanted to become closer with Yennekar, maybe I could say, \u2018He\u2019s so cute\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s so adorable\u2019. Or maybe something like, \u2018I also want to sign a contract with a spirit like him. I\u2019m so jealous!\u2019 or other such things.In terms of friendliness, she was the best in the class. In terms of social life, she was someone who was always comfortable to be with.There was no need to force conversations or struggle to find a topic that suited you.She was someone who would continue conversations cheerfully even if she was just listening to a story. She was someone that everyone in the second-year class loved.But because of that, I had to be more careful if I wanted to keep my distance. She was someone I could easily become close to. Therefore, I needed to make conscious efforts not to.The way to do so was not difficult to answer.\u201cI don\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying.\u201dAll I had to do was block the flow of conversation.\u201cI can\u2019t see anything. I can't see spirits because I don't have spirit resonance.\u201dI got rid of all our common interests in one stroke. There would be nothing more for the other person to say if I quickly cut things like this. It would be awkward to try and search for another topic to talk about.And because Yennekar was no fool, she would notice that I didn't want to become close with her.Having lived surrounded by kind people, it must be difficult for her to handle such hostility,\u201c... Is that so?\u201dYennekar answered, tilting her head as she faced me.\u201cYou can\u2019t see spirits?\u201dThis was nothing unusual. Not all students in the Magic Department could see spirits.Nevertheless, Yennekar tilted her head a few times.\u201cYennekar! Quickly! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to run out of desserts!\u201dHer rescue team came back. They quickly hugged onto Yennekar and took her back into the crowd.\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll see you again later!\u201dIt was a spectacle seeing her smiling widely and waving at me.Well, her rescuers would warn her while eating dessert.Do not approach Ed Rothstaylor carelessly.She would slowly start to lose interest in me then.It wasn't so bad, if you ask me.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Finally, the top students of each grade will award the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019 to the freshman representative.

After all, the protagonist of this world was a freshman himself.There were some things players noticed when playing 'Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster'.Why were the first-year students the only ones who were doing well?\u2018The Benevolent Princess Penia\u2019 took control of the student council in her second year as the de facto student body president, becoming an influential figure who controlled academic affairs and rooted out injustice within the academy.On the contrary, \u2018The Golden Daughter, Lortel\u2019 encroached on the darkness of Silvenia and took control of the flow and distribution of money, coordinating interests between the students to make large amounts of money.Meanwhile, \u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019, who was born with talent and blessed by the stars of Glockt, became an archmage who came out in history books.There were more but it would be difficult to mention every single important character. The important thing was they were all gathered among the first-year students.The semester hadn't even started yet, but thanks to the first years who shone like gems, the atmosphere among the faculty must have already been exciting.The \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019 was a record left behind by the founder of Silvenia Academy, Silvenia Robester. There was always a ceremony to award the seal to the freshmen for them to inherit the will of Silvenia who emphasized the virtue of learning.People tried to give it various meanings, but it was just all ceremonial.I kept looking around as I watched the ceremony come to its final stages.Right now, everyone was sitting here in Kate Hall regardless of their batch. There weren't many opportunities for students from different classes and majors to sit together.The auditorium was filled with freshmen who had varied talents and backgrounds. But these people are nothing more than just \u2018characters.\u2019What's really important was to find this world\u2019s protagonist, Taylee.Thank you for running around on your own and solving all the hardships that would happen to Silvenia Academy without me having to lift a finger, you pushover\u2013No, I meant, you troubleshooter of a nobleman.There was no one I would be more thankful for because he understood all my hardships and would take care of them for me.Also, the surest way to check that the world was going in the way that I knew was to check on Taylee. His actions would soon determine the history of this world.I should walk around and check where Taylee might be.Either way, Ed Rothstaylor had already been completely ruined so I could even walk out if I wanted to. After all, no one would care whether I was alone or not at such a grand entrance ceremony.No, it would actually attract more attention if I just stay put here.Since I was already quite full, now would be the perfect time to get up and look around.\"This is an announcement. Can the student \u2018Ed Rothstaylor\u2019 visit Dean McDowell\u2019s office? Thank you.\"I suddenly heard my name from the platform.McDowell. That was a name that I knew.He was the chief dean of Silvenia\u2019s Magic Department. In fact, he was a figure influential enough to have the authority to appoint professors.And he was looking for me?\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 Am I getting expelled\u2026?\u201dThese days, did the highest academic authority directly notify students of their expulsion from the academy? To bid me goodbye so earnestly on my way out?\u201c... have my chances already been ruined?\u201dI wiped my face.No, let\u2019s stay calm.......But what\u2019s this?Just what was going on?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Face-to-Face With The Dean (2)As large as Silvenia\u2019s campus was, the administrative chart was equally as complicated.Even though it may look like a spider web, these kinds of charts would usually become quite simple towards the top.Dean McDowell of Silvenia\u2019s Magic Department had the highest authority among the three deans of the academy. He was also part of that simple section of the administrative chart.From the top, his name stems from the second branch, right after the Assistant Headmaster.\u201cThe Academic Affairs staff didn\u2019t go through with your expulsion process. Well, I guess they figured there wasn\u2019t a need for it.\u201dAt first glance, he seemed like an easy-going person, with his bushy beard and worn-out glasses. But his attitude towards me was anything but.I didn't touch the tea his secretary served me, knowing I wasn't in a friendly atmosphere.\u201cDo you want us to have to go through the academic regulations and invoke the disciplinary committee to sentence you to leave the academy?\u201dDean McDowell said with a firm face as he sat across from me.Even though it was an unexpected truth spoken with power and attitude that held weight, this was just a superficial appearance from the dean.An act to cover up his compassionate and weak-hearted personality.It was a fact only revealed through completing the sub-quests. So as someone who had gone through the hardships of completing every story branch of Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster, this wasn't surprising.After all, in order to serve as the dean in a place full of strong characters like the Magic Department, it was inevitable for him to take on a rather coercive attitude.That's just the nature of academic politics, to take advantage of pushovers. It's why it was admirable that he was able to maintain his true character.\u201cIf it\u2019s too difficult to go through all that process, the Academic Affairs will just expel you.\u201dThis was why I couldn't help but be puzzled for two reasons.First, just as I mentioned, Dean McDowell was not the kind of person to confront his students. So to act in such a threatening manner didn\u2019t suit him.Second was his position as the dean. Not only was he a dean, he also held the highest authority over the other deans. He was in a position where he didn't have to be involved in expelling a student. Rather, he was someone who reviewed and approved implementation plans.His position didn't match this kind of grunt work.Calling a student over and sitting him down to discuss whether to expel them or not\u2026 It was strange. It would be similar to going to the district office to get a copy of a document only to see the head of the office was the one reviewing complaints.\u201cDo you have any excuse for this?\u201dIf I were a regular student, I wouldn't have been able to think this far. I probably would've panicked that a high-ranking noble called me to declare I was expelled from the academy.After giving it this much thought, I saw his true intention.He was only trying to get me flustered.\u201cThat is a reasonable thing to say.\u201dI decided to respond with something simple to allow me more time to think.I was in a luxurious and elegant reception room, put in the unusual situation of suddenly having to leave such a public event like the opening ceremony. Having dressed up well, I was now in a private meeting with someone of high authority, his intense and threatening attitude compounded with the gloomy possibility of being expelled right before my eyes.The higher your rank was, the better you were at creating these kinds of situational pressures.He was just trying to see my reaction to this situation.But then, the question followed\u2026Just why?Ed Rothstaylor was just an ordinary student from a noble family. He didn't have any prominent magical talent, nor did he stand out in terms of writing.And one's nobility was nothing more than a business card in Silvenia. There were so many students from either noble or rich families. Even the princess herself was a student.So how was Ed Rothstaylor considered important enough for a private conversation, taking up the dean\u2019s precious time?There were only a few possibilities.I sighed deeply.\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Princess Penia for looking over the people, even in the academy. She always paid careful attention, no matter how insignificant.\u201dI said without obvious reason.Suddenly mentioning the princess while talking about my possible expulsion\u2026 it would be ridiculous to say something unrelated to the conversation.What are you talking about?Why are we talking about that now?These reactions should follow.But\u2013\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dAnd in that short moment, I saw the dean's forehead narrow. It was very brief, but I caught his reaction.\u201cJust what are you talking about now?\u201dNevertheless, he was able to maintain his position as Chief Dean for over five years. It took him less than a second to school his face back into a poker face.But that brief moment was enough for me to realize the truth.Just as I thought.There were only three people in the academy who were of higher authority than Dean McDowell: Headmaster Obel, Assistant Headmaster Reina and Princess Penia.Since I didn't have any connection to either the headmaster nor the assistant headmaster, there was no reason for them to care about me. This made the possibility of it being the princess much higher.No matter how the virtue of learning takes precedence over nobility in the academy, it wouldn't have been possible to just ignore the princess's words.In a way, this was very much like Princess Penia.Why didn't she just gather up her soldiers to tie me up and blackmail me to reveal all my secrets in detail to want to get expelled?Did she not think that would've made me confess everything?Or were such barbaric and coercive means not her style? Or perhaps she found them meaningless?It was probably both.But looking at the results, it was a correct judgment.Even if they tied me up and blackmailed me, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to confess that I merely possessed this body, and that Ed Rothstaylor was a separate person from me.There was no way they would've believed it. I would've been treated like a mad man.That's why she came up with something else.\u201cNothing, it was just something I blurted out. I apologize. Haha\u2026 What am I talking about\u2026 Must be because I\u2019m nervous\u2026 Hahahahaha\u2026\u201dI mumbled and scratched the back of my head, as if I was embarrassed.I laughed like an idiot, but Dean McDowell\u2019s eyes sharply looked at me.He was already used to these kinds of situations.I already figured that out a while ago.But this\u2026. push and pull had gone too far.\u201cI was just\u2026 thinking about what the \u2018correct answer\u2019 might be.\u201dI decided to go with confidence.\u201cI was just wondering what could be the reason for calling me out to sit here while you measure my potential\u2026 and what I should say to get the \u2018correct answer\u2019.\u201dI knew that sentencing someone with an expulsion was just to make an example for others.That was just a fact based on the natural circumstances. \u2018I am trying to figure you out, to some extent,\u2019 was what he really meant.If this was someone overbearing and oppressive, this kind of approach would've been counterproductive, since they might view it as me trying to be on par with them, hurting their ego.But I already knew that Dean McDowell was surprisingly not authoritative like that.\u201cI know what I did was wrong\u2026 But I don\u2019t think it was a mistake deserving of expulsion.\u201d\u201cIf you look through the academy's bylaws, there is enough reason to expel you.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t bylaws and regulations always vague and ambiguous? There\u2019s a lot of room for interpretation. That\u2019s why there's a disciplinary committee, giving students the chance to speak.\u201dI decided to go with a basic answer.\u201cThat said, I think I have no choice but to take advantage of all the opportunities available to me\u2013persuading the disciplinary committee members as much as possible, putting up posters on the academic affairs wall, and persuading my classmates. I\u2019m going to file an appeal that I was treated unfairly.\u201dIt would become troublesome for the academy.\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cNot at all. This is just what I believe.\u201dI said with confidence.It wasn't like I was in a position to give out threats. What kind of threat could a student on the verge of expulsion give against the head dean?If they really wanted to expel me, they could simply ignore such trivial words. It might've been annoying and irritating for a bit, but it would've just ended there. After all, there was no way the other students would sympathize with Ed Rothstaylor.\u201cI\u2019m just doing everything that I can. If I get expelled\u2026 There's nothing I can do. But I think I will regret it later if I just leave the academy without doing anything.\u201dI took a sip of the tea they gave me.\u201cIs this much\u2026 good enough for a \u2018correct answer\u2019?\u201dI feel like I was talking to him while wearing a mask. I\u2019m sure it was the very same for him.For a while, there was silence.McDowell looked at me for a long time, his hand resting on his chin. After a moment, he finally said something.\u201cPrincess Penia said there was something a bit difficult about you. At this point, I kind of agree with what she said.\u201dThe blessing of Insightful Eyes that judges humans, and the dean\u2019s secret conversation with the princess who was born with it.The fact that Princess Penia was destined to always pay attention to me\u2026 without any mention, we already both knew.\u201cYou are cunning like a fox, but I don\u2019t feel any ill intent inside of you.\u201d\u201cIf you say that, wouldn't it seem like I\u2019m trying to trick you?\u201d\u201cYou are calmer than the other students who tremble just by sitting in this office.\u201dDid I act too calmly? That's what I thought. But there was nothing I could do about it now.\u201cAnyways, let's end it here. I\u2019ll hold off on answering whether you gave the correct answer or not.\u201d\u201cThen about my expulsion\u2026 what will happen to it?\u201dDean McDowell laughed out loud, smiling widely. It was my first time seeing the dean like this.\u201cYou\u2019re also quite sly.\u201dDidn't you already know I had no intention to expel you? Didn't you already notice from the very beginning?To say that in such a roundabout but sophisticated way\u2026 now that was the Dean McDowell that I knew.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *I almost got fucked\u2026!I threw firewood into the campfire and sighed in relief.I didn't know what it was, but it felt like a very important turning point for my future plans.Even though I said all that, I knew I might\u2019ve lost everything had I answered wrong.I took a peek at McDowell when I closed the door and left, but his relaxed and laughing face had gone. He looked agonized and serious once again.He was seriously evaluating me.I shouldn\u2019t let my guard down around him.Anyway, since the dice had already been rolled, I would just do what I had to do.[ Newly Crafted Product ]Simple Drying RackA simple wooden dryer capable of drying laundry, food, and other things.The support is not strong enough to bear a lot of weight.Production Difficulty Level:\u00a0\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Production completed.

It was also the skill directly connected to my Dexterity stat.In other words, as my proficiency level for this skill rises, so will my proficiency with my other skills.In addition to that, there was a huge significance for having reached the level 10 of a skill. It meant I had fully learned the basics of that skill.After reaching this level, the required experience for each subsequent level rises significantly. This meant that a proper investment needed to be made.I flopped down on the flat rock, staying near the heat of the campfire.Compared to the sofa in the dean\u2019s office, this was too hard and cold. But ever since coming into this world, I had been indebted to this rock, so much so that it felt like it was now perfectly molded into the shape of my butt.Sitting in my camp that had truly become like my own home, I opened and closed the palms of my hands in front of my eyes.\u201cAs expected\u2026 this guy shouldn't have been born a noble.\u201dMy daily life production skills are leveling dramatically faster than my combat or magic skills.Even with natural-born talent, no one could thrive unless there was support from the environment. Since Ed grew up as a pampered noble, he lived his life ruining his talents in production.He probably thought cooking and fixing things were acts too lowly for his status. Well, it couldn\u2019t be helped. He was a noble, after all.\u201cNevertheless, I was able to create a somewhat livable space for myself through my hard work.\u201dMy living circumstances might make me seem like a homeless person when compared to that of Ophelis Hall, Silvenia's dormitory which had the best facilities on campus. But I have already grown attached to this camp which I built with my own hands.And because I indulged in the feast at the opening ceremony, I didn't feel the slightest bit of hunger at all. I might just fall asleep like this\u2026\u201cBut I can\u2019t fall asleep quite yet.\u201dI had a lot of spare time because today was only the opening ceremony. And because I still didn't have any classes to be late to, there was no need to rush this morning. This enabled me to take a leisurely walk to school, leaving me with a lot of energy.I picked up a few books I had on the grass. I didn't want to sleep just yet as I was planning to read before it got any darker. I borrowed a book from the library about various edible plants and wild herbs.Knowledge was a survival skill. I could expand my diet if I were able to distinguish the edible plant life in the forest.\u201cMaybe I should try making a workbench or a reading table. I could give it a try over the weekend.\u201dWith that in mind, I laid down in my simple wooden shelter and opened the book.And fell asleep within seconds.Like I had fainted.Well, honestly, I was a bit tired\u2026* * *Tucked in a corner of the academic district was the dean of the Magic Department's officeDean McDowell was sitting on the couch, holding his chin, thinking. It had been a while since Ed Rothstaylor left.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe was still sitting there despite having a lot of work left, deep in thought without moving an inch.The dean's secretary sighed at the sight as she organized documents.It had been a while since the dean would become so deeply immersed in his thoughts, that he would end up doing nothing.This caused his work to get delayed, which meant the secretary also couldn't leave on time.So she decided to clean her desk as it looked like she wouldn't be able to go home on time anyway. She had been putting it off for a while, after all.\u201cIt seems like he might be out of it for a while\u2026 I wonder what he's thinking about so deeply like that\u2026\u201dThe secretary looked at Dean McDowell, who looked like a statue lost in thought, and then looked out the window full of stars.The starry sky was very beautiful today, thanks to the clear sky. She opened the window to let some air in.\u201cSecretary Agnus.\u201dDean McDowell suddenly called her.\u201cWas my acting that obvious?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dThe dean was usually so perfect that sometimes, Agnus herself wonders if he had a dual personality. At the very least, as the dean's secretary, she should know as she was always there.Agnus stuttered that wasn't the case to answer the dean\u2019s strange question.And just like that, the night over the academic district grew darker.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Stray Cat (1)As was common knowledge, games were usually played from the protagonist's point of view. This meant there weren't a lot of things I could do since I've already had my downfall, played my part, and essentially left the stage.However, the great news was that since I've already played the game several times from the protagonist's point of view, I could roughly guess what event was currently happening, just based on the timing and the academy's schedule.This meant there was no reason for me to feel frustrated from not knowing the state the academy was in or what was going on. I felt comforted by this fact.On the contrary, I was surprised by how many things I didn't know because the game progressed from Taylee's point of view.An example would be the Magic Department's curriculum.As the main character, Taylee was a student of the Combat Department, hence the game's title, 'Failed Swordmaster'. This meant there was no way for the player to know what kind of life the Magic Department students had.Another example was the things that happened outside of Taylee's activities.Like the new buildings and statues being built under the sponsorship of \u2018The Golden Daughter, Lortel\u2019. As well as the royal knights stationed at the entrance of the academic district to escort \u2018The Benevolent Princess Penia.\u2019Even though these things were not part of the main story, they made the world look and feel alive.In fact, I had quite a few stories I was curious about that were never revealed in the game.There were countless of them, but if I had to pick just one\u2026 it would have to be Yennekar Palerover.As the final boss of Act 1, the story of her being possessed by the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper was not seriously fleshed out.She might have been considered the final boss on paper, but the real boss was Velosper, whom she summoned, the right-hand man of the highest-ranking dark spirit GlasskanBut high-ranking dark spirits descended through an Elementalist's pessimistic thoughts or the darkness in their heart.And while there was darkness in everyone, no matter how big or small\u2026 wasn't Yennekar someone who was completely removed from such darkness?She had a bright personality by nature, born with such liveliness and joy.Just what in the world happened to Yennekar that she would fall under the influence of a high-ranking dark spirit?\u2026 not like I had the time to pay attention to that.Whatever it may be, Taylee would take care of Velosper and save the student center.* * *\u201cThis is too hard\u2026\u201dIt had been ten days since school started.\u201cWouldn't I die at this rate? Like, seriously\u2026?\u201dI was resting on a bench in the academic district, the sun setting over the horizon, when I was hit with a moment of post-nut clarity* out of nowhere.* TN: metaphor, a moment of realizationMy daily routine every school day was as follows:I would wake up before sunrise and thoroughly wash myself in the stream, making sure to clean every nook and cranny as I was afraid of smelling.I would then run to the academic district through the northern forest wearing casual clothes that I could wash every day.I would always be covered in sweat by the time I arrived, so I would secretly wash up in the bathroom of Glockt Hall.Then I would change into my school uniform, and hide my casual clothes in the grass in the Rose Garden to take with me after school.After all of that, I would head to the hall where my classes took place. It was where I met and mingled with children from noble families and top students alike, so I had to be careful of maintaining an upright behavior.My reputation was already rock bottom in the academy, so I had to deal with all sorts of gossip whenever I passed by. I even started feeling empty when I didn't hear such gossip around me these days.I also got used to being invisible in my classes.After focusing on my studies, it was lunchtime.I would eat lunch boxes because I couldn't afford the expensive and luxurious cafeteria at Ophelis Hall, nor the cafeteria in the student union building. My lunch boxes were my usual wild meals I brought from my camp.I had been using rock salts to make beef jerky lately. I would hang the cured meat for about three days in the simple drying rack I crafted. This, somehow, enabled me to make decent beef jerky.There was no better and simpler food than a jerky as it was a portable meal that also satisfied my hunger. My cooking proficiency also increased due to it, which was a bonus!After filling up with lunch, I would finish the afternoon lectures like an invisible ghost, all the way to the end of the school day.I would then take the casual clothes I hid and head back into the northern forest. Leaving around sunset allowed me to arrive at my camp just as it was getting dark.I tried training my Vitality stat in the beginning by running back home as much as possible. But ever since we started magic practical classes, the use of magic power left me without much energy so I've had to walk back home slowly.The first thing I would do when I returned to camp was wash the sweaty casual clothes I wore that morning. I always had to dry it in advance so I could wear it again the next day.I would also inspect my school uniform to make sure it was kept elegant and neat at all times. I had to make sure there was no dirt on it, nor any tears. And if any was found, I would immediately repair it using thread I took from other fabrics.After dealing with my clothes, I would then do everything else I needed to do for the day, which differed from day to day.I would check if I was running out of any herbs or medicinal plants, and if I was, I would then go out and collect some. I also always checked the condition of the pile of wood I had trimmed.I would also check the cave for my meat supply. If I noticed I had started to run out, I would take my bow and go out to hunt. It was actually more convenient to hunt using the harpoon and spear I previously made. But with my future in mind, I forced myself to hunt using the bow because I knew I had to level up my proficiency for it.But if the results for that day's hunt were too abysmal, of course, I would use a different weapon. I needed to eat to live, after all.And after the sun had fully set, I would light up the campfire so I had a secure light source. Then it was time to do my homework.I would go over the practice assignments on a wide stone plate I had fashioned into a workbench. My strong suits were areas where writing was an important factor like Magic History and Elemental Studies. Thankfully, I was still a quick thinker.It had been a while since I held a pen, but there was also a time when I was a test-taker, going through the rough period of studying to pass Korea's college entrance exam. It was as if my body still remembered all my study habits from that time. Hurray for South Korea\u2019s private education craze\u2026?!I used a small poker to write on the stone slab with ashes. I had also borrowed books from the student library since there was no way I could afford my own personal books, nor a quill pen and ink.And as the moon rose high in the sky, I would practice magic alone.My first goal was to get my elemental beginner magic proficiency to level 10. The second-year curriculum already introduced intermediate magic, so there would be nothing I could do if I was stuck struggling with beginner magic.I trained my magic practically by using\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0to trim trees and controlling the campfire using my fire-type magic.I would start feeling sleepy at this point, but I knew it wasn't time to sleep quite yet. I still had a lot of work to do before I could go to bed.I would inspect my simple shelter and check for any problems, then I would replenish the firewood in the campfire to make sure it had enough through the night. After this, I would check the beef jerky I bring to school the next day, as well as my water container, which I refill as needed.I would then go over tomorrow's timetable and organize my thoughts on how I will spend the next day. After that, I would fill the shelter with campfire smoke to drive the bugs away. Then I ventilate it and finally go to bed where I would get about four hours or so of good sleep.Thankfully, I never overslept no matter how tired I was. Owing to having gone to the military, I got used to this routine pretty quickly.This was the life I led for the last ten days.My whole body had been screaming from the muscle pains.I looked up at the sunset sky as I sat on the bench, taking a short break from my current situation. When I go back to camp, there would be a mountain of work I needed to do.\u201cAt the very least, I should move the camp a little closer\u2026\u201dI thought about it for a moment and shook my head no. Nothing good would come out of living among the other students' living areas. Plus, the long-distance I travel to and fro every day helped with my vitality. No, don't be weak!\u201cAghhhkk!\u201dI could barely get my creaky body up from the wooden bench to get back on the road again. But what more could I do when I possessed a body like this?I had to accept this much.Surely, better days were bound to come.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *But a fortunate thought came to mind as I traversed through the northern forest.That the past ten days had given me confidence in my ability to sustain this lifestyle.I had somehow managed to keep at it, no matter how fucking difficult and tiring it had been.It was probably because my student life had been calmer and more peaceful than I had imagined.Everyone would gossip and look at me with contempt wherever I went. In the end, I didn't really care anymore.What could I even do about it? It wasn't even me who did those things. And besides, Ed Rothstaylor was just unlikeable, to begin with.It was a much better situation than with the first-years, where chaos would break loose left and right, always out for an adventure.As it was early in the first semester, \u2018Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019 must have already blown up the Research Building, and \u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019 had already electrocuted the dean's cat with lightning magic. Their year already had a lot of events happening.Additionally, the first-year students of the Combat, Magic and Alchemy Department must have already had their first hands-on class against monsters. Soon enough, the main character Taylee would start meeting the other main characters and getting acquainted with them.Taking a step backstage, my surprisingly calm and regular life continued. Yeah\u2026 it wasn't so bad when I thought about it this way.After all, if one were to keep reliving a hard and tiring day by day, they would eventually get used to it.All I had to do was stay away from the main characters and continue on with my life. Then, I would earn my diploma, and when the academy goes into chaos\u2026Bye bye!Well, not that the academy would collapse. It was an ordeal that would resolve on its own, so not like there was a reason for me to deal with it.When I thought of things like this, I couldn\u2019t help but think I've been doing a good job thus far.Yeah, there was no reason to feel frustrated over anything.Except for one variable.Yennekar Palerover.\u201cHello!\u201d\u201cWhat are you eating?!

Elemental Studies?\u201d\u201cDo you want to eat at the student cafeteria with me?\u201dThese past ten days, whenever Yennekar saw me around the academic district, she would always give me an unchanging lively greeting.Of course, her two best friends would always appear and drag her away soon after.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dThis wasn\u2019t part of my plan. There shouldn\u2019t be a reason for her to be this interested in me\u2026 Did I make some type of mistake? Or was there an aspect I hadn't realized?\u201cWell\u2026 it should be fine.\u201dThrough the forest, the sun had begun to set. And across the branches, I began to see my camp that had now comfortably become my home.But it was still a long way home.I had said this before, but I was a foreign entity in this world who would follow its authentic story.If I were to become a variable that could change the flow of the world, then I would have lost my advantage of knowing the future.Therefore, it was only right that I maintained a certain distance from the important people of this world. Well, it might have been awkward to forcefully try to become close, but it was easy to keep my distance.I could do this!The post-nut clarity from a while ago had begun to fade to some extent. And the hope that I would be able to do well took its spot.Yes, one way or another, everything would work out!I had been keeping my distance from other people, so much so that it had become so boring, but that's okay! I could do this!With my heart filled with hope and the drive to live today to the fullest, I took a step into my camp.\u201cZzz\u2026 Zzz\u2026\u201dIt was then that I found a girl curled up and sleeping in my simple shelter.Her neck was covered by the brim of her witch's hat, so wide that it could cover the entirety of her face. And her breathing\u2026 that breathing that sounded as if everything was bothering her\u2026 I was able to figure out her identity as soon as I heard it.I sat down on a rock.\u201cSigh...\u201dIt was a sigh from the depths of my heart.\u201cJust why\u2026 why is this girl sleeping here?!\u201dIt was the first time meeting her, but how could I not know her? She would play an active part from the beginning till the end of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019.She was such an important person that she could be considered on the same level as the other four heroines. She was someone with an important presence in the main story.It might be hard to judge by her appearance, with how she seemed lazy and uninterested, but she was overwhelmingly one of the most important characters.So why the fuck was she sleeping here?\u201c......\u201dI looked around my camp.We were in the northern forest of Acken Island. A faraway place where nobody went. But to a student who was as genius as she was, to use her magic power to traverse through space so quickly was as easy as breathing. This forest wouldn't have been that far for her.First of all, her behavior could be likened to that of a street cat.Due to her small body and her talent to bounce around using magic swiftly, she could go to the top of the clock tower, or the rooftop of Glockt Hall, or any great place for naps where she would get the perfect amount of sunlight\u2026 she could literally go anywhere.So why the hell is she here?!To this place where there were no people, which was far away from the academic buildings, where a shelter with a roof was, where you could hear the cool wind and the pleasant sound of the stream\u2026There was no better place to skip classes and take a nap.......\u201cFuck! It was my own fault!\u201dI shouted out too late, my monologue meaningless.I could hear \u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019 gently exhale as she slept, as if in a whisper.I covered my eyes with one hand in exasperation.I had no choice but to sit still for a while.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Stray Cat (2)It might be rude to compare people to animals but Yennekar Palerover reminds me of an overly excited Golden Retriever, someone whom people would naturally gravitate towards.She was similar to a puppy waving its tail to happily greet everyone. And wouldn't you want to hug or pat such a puppy?That was probably what our class felt with Yennekar. They always flock to her whenever they see her, hugging her and linking arms with her.In fact, they would always aggressively stare at me if I so much as stepped within a three-meter radius of her, in fear that I might be a bad influence.Now, if Yennekar was like a cute puppy, then Lucy Mayreel was a stray cat.Yes, the sound of her rough breathing while cuddled up did indeed resemble that of a cat, but it wasn't just about her outer appearance.You see, wild stray cats could never be tamed.They were never affectionate or friendly to passersby, or at least, all the stray cats I had seen in my life were.Street cats had their own rules in life which they followed amongst themselves.They were always the center of their world, even if they were living in some shabby back alley somewhere. And no matter how dirty and ragged their fur was, their steps were always refined, like that of a princess.And it wasn't like such an attitude was due to their vanity, nor were they acting like that on purpose. It's just\u2026 the way they were born.And Lucy Mayreel was born just like that.\u201cUghaaahk-\u201dShe stretched as she sat up.It had been about 30 minutes since I came back to my camp only to find Lucy sleeping in my shelter.I spent that time sitting down and thinking about what I was supposed to do about her.The sun had almost fully set, and on a spring day such as this, the high sky had begun to darken.\u201c......\u201dLucy sat absentmindedly, her eyes not fully awake yet. A few strands of her hair were stubbornly stuck on her cheek.And as soon as she woke up in someone else's place, the first thing she said was,\u201c... I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u201dAh\u2026 I admire her for such a talent.We finally met eyes, and for a while, I just sat there on my rock by the campfire and stared at her without a word, chin propped by the palm of my hand. If she were any regular girl, she would've already grasped the situation and felt embarrassed.But this was Lucy Mayreel.\u201cOut of 100 points\u2026 about 90.\u201dI just sat still.\u201cI think the way you covered it with leaves was nice because it allowed the sunlight to only subtly pass through. The breeze flowing inside was also refreshing, which was good. As soon as I laid down, I fell asleep right away.\u201dDid my camp just become one of Lucy Mayreel's top three places to take a nap in Silvenia Academy?\u201cBut I didn't have a choice but to sleep face down as the floor was covered with clothes\u2026 it would have been nicer had it been a little softer. But it blocks the sun quite well and I also liked the sound of the flowing stream nearby.\u201dShe expertly assessed without changing her blank facial expression.\u201cIt was great.\u201dThere was no change in her expression, but there was a strange twinkling feeling that convinced me she felt quite satisfied.\u2026 Just what the hell am I saying?Lucy stood up and stretched her limbs once more.My wooden shelter was wider than one might think. But that\u2019s all it was. Its width was wide but the ceiling stopped around my shoulders. To put it simply, I couldn't stand inside.So seeing Lucy stretching inside such a narrow space made me realize our difference in physique. She really was a small girl. Even the sleeves of her school uniform were loose despite her wearing what must have been the smallest size.Suddenly, Lucy\u2019s stomach started to rumble as she popped out of the shelter.Yes, \u2018popped out\u2019 was the perfect way to describe her action.Her footwork resembled those of Murim martial arts movies. She was gathering magic at the tip of her toes and was using elemental wind and gravity magic, along with high-level shock absorption magic, just to land her small body in her desired place.She was using all kinds of high-level magic as she moved around, as if she was a god. She was multicasting five or six spells that even professors at the Magic Department would need to concentrate to use. She was doing everything instinctively, unconsciously.\u201cIs this dried meat? Can I eat it?\u201dLucy picked up a piece of jerky I had lying around and took a bite off it.She licked her lips as she chewed.\u201cEghk\u2013! It\u2019s too salty.\u201dShe stuck out her tongue with a frown.\u201c...Though, there also seems to be an indescribable taste?\u201dShe then took another bite.She seemed to start to enjoy the salty taste after chewing for a while, so she ended up eating the whole thing. Then she pointed to another piece.\u201cCan I have another one?\u201d\u201c...okay.\u201dShe then sat on top of my drying rack and twirled her feet in the air, as if she truly enjoyed the taste of my jerky.She frowned at how salty it was at first, hating it. But now she kept on chewing with a completely satisfied look on her face.\u2026ah. Just what is this feeling? I'm feeling some type of way.It felt like that unique satisfaction you get when you're feeding a cute pet.Wait, was this\u2026 did I just become a cat mom?What is this addictive feeling all of a sudden\u2026?\u201c......\u201dNo! I frantically shook my head. Get it together\u2026 This is Lucy Mayreel!She was a key character in \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster.\u2019 Nothing good would come out of getting involved with her.\u201cIt was too salty at first, but now I actually really like it because it\u2019s salty. It\u2019s quite a sensational taste.\u201d\u201c......\u201d\u201cThis salty taste\u2026 I love it.\u201dAh\u2026 I understood it now.Lucy Mayreel was an unprecedented genius with overwhelmingly high grades among the first-years. This meant she must be living in Ophelis Hall where they allowed only the best students to stay.Ophelis Hall boasted of having the best facilities among the three major dormitories in Silvenia. You couldn't stay at Ophelis without either a high status or a high grade.Therefore, the student cafeteria at Ophelis Hall only served the best food from the best chefs in the kingdom. The taste was often sophisticated and refined, suited for high-ranking nobles.But there was a taste that such high-quality food cannot offer.The \u2018Salty, Spicy, Sweet\u201d combo.A taste outside the realm of a sophisticated palate that only cared about the freshness of ingredients, the harmony of tastes, and a balanced nutrition. It was a provocative taste that didn't care about one's health.It was like a whisper from the devil.\u201cCan I take all of this?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThat would be crossing the line. That\u2019s my lunch, you kid!\u201cUghhh\u2026\u201dI felt sad at seeing her disappointed face. But it may just be a snack to her, but it was my means to survive.She could just eat a lot of the high-quality food back at Ophelis Hall.Suddenly, I had a brilliant idea.\u201cCome to think of it\u2026\u201dLucy was indifferent to hardships, and she wasn't afraid of anyone in the academy. The Benevolent Princess Penia, The Golden Daughter Lortel, and the renowned evil Professor Glast\u2014they were all equals to Lucy who had a carefree soul.But that didn't mean there was no one who could control the unpredictable Lucy.\u201cUhm\u2026 I actually heard the Ophelis Hall maids were looking for you.\u201dLucy\u2019s face turned blue as soon as she heard those words.And with a kick that pushed her off into the air, she disappeared in an instant.Then she reappeared right back and flew into the shelter to grab her wide-brimmed witch hat.\u201cI think I have to go.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 Good luck.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come again later.\u201dNo, please don\u2019t come back.\u201cBut before I go, I have something to say. She asked me to tell you.\u201dI already wasted too much time with Lucy.I was in the middle of preparing to wash the casual clothes I need to wear tomorrow.Lucy pointed at the forest.\u201cWhat?\u201dI looked in the direction Lucy was pointing, but there was nothing but trees.\u201c......\u201d\u201cThat wolf that\u2019s the size of a house, it keeps on watching over you.\u201dGoosebumps ran down my back in an instant.There was a whole realm not yet visible to me as someone who hadn't trained my spirit resonance just yet.\u201cSomeday, by all means, please save Yennekar.\u201dAnd then Lucy disappeared again, leaving me with that message as if it was nothing.I slowly turned my head back to where Lucy was pointing to.It was filled with the sound of crickets crying through the overgrown trees.Other than that, there was nothing else I could see.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[ Announcement ]There will be a joint combat class for the first and second-year students. Please check your assigned group through the distributed list.Who: Students enrolled in the Intro to Basic Cooperative Combat Class and the Advanced Cooperative Combat Class at theWhere: Common Combat Training Facility in the Nail Hall\u203b Participation from the Alchemy Department students is too low! It's great to practice Alchemy, but please participate in common classes as well!\u2013 Professor Claire Elfin,Assistant Professor of Combat PracticeThe announcement was made during the second-year students' meeting at the student center the next day.Was it already time for the joint combat class?Things were progressing quite fast. This was the event where Yennekar Palerover first appeared in the game.Apart from the monster battle that would take place, this was where the second-year political drama began. What would happen was quite obvious, given the circumstances.Both combat and politics were important variables in this world. One must always keep an eye on them.Anyhow, I wasn't able to get a proper look at Taylee since I was called to the dean\u2019s office last time. But since this was a joint combat class, I would definitely be able to see the faces of the main characters from the first-years.It was an opportunity for me to check if the story was moving along \u2018properly\u2019 and if nothing had been changed.I stretched my stiff shoulders as I walked out of the student center, aching from staying up all night trimming my arrows.I would continue living this hellish lifestyle, but humans were adaptable creatures. I could feel that my body had somehow started to adjust. It would be nice if I could significantly raise my Vitality stat.But I was sure everything would work out well in the end.Ah\u2026 I was even able to think of such hopeful thoughts for quite a bit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Joint Combat Practice (1)The first and second-year students' joint combat class may seem like a normal event but it actually had a fair amount of importance in the story. That's because this event was when Taylee would first hold a sword.Taylee had only previously learned hand-to-hand combat in accordance with the Combat Department's curriculum. But in this event, he cut down Lazy Lucy's lightning attack with a sword.Taylee had been born with a talent for swordsmanship. And for him who hadn't realized he had such a talent and had only been training in bare-handed martial arts, this event was a turning point in his life.He was paired with Lucy Mayreel, whose own talent hadn't fully bloomed yet. Taylee succeeded in cutting down Lucy's lightning attack, catching her off guard. Lucy retaliated with an overwhelming intermediate lightning spell, ultimately defeating Taylee.However, in doing so, Lucy broke one of the rules which only allowed the use of beginner elemental magic. This earned Lucy a disqualification and earned Taylee the win.Through the duel, Taylee confirmed his talent as a swordsman and his name began to circulate among the entire first-year students.Despite having received that dreadful ending blow and only winning due to a technicality, it was still true that he did beat Lucy Mayreel.And since there hadn't been any big changes yet, things would probably go according to the original story, right?A long-awaited weekend.It was an opportunity to take care of all the things I couldn't get done during the school week.I discovered there was a lot more room for food than I had thought. Hunting became more efficient after I became more proficient to a certain extent. But the most crucial thing was I learned how to set up hunting traps.[ Newly Crafted Product ]Snare TrapA trap installed by tying a rope obtained from the construction site of the Olren Hall to an elastic tree trunk.Effective at catching small animals.Production Difficulty Level: \u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Production completed. Production skills have increased. \u300bDespite it being hurriedly made through following the instructions I found in a survival guide I borrowed from the library, it turned out better than I expected. My production skills had gone up and my woodworking skill had almost reached level 10.Above all else, traps were time efficient. Even when I was attending my classes throughout the day, the traps were there, doing their job.After every school day, all I had to do was go around the places I left traps at and collect the wild animals dangling from the trees.At first, all I could get were small creatures like tree squirrels and rabbits, but I would hit the jackpot sometimes and get something like a raccoon. Of course, more often than not, the rope would rip, or the jerky I left as bait would be gone.But considering how little labor was required once every trap was set, it was still an advantageous method.And with establishing this dual method of procuring food through direct hunting and using traps, I was able to obtain more than enough meat. It had come to a point where hunting wasn't the problem, rather, it was the hard labor involved in cleaning the animals. But even then, it was a problem to be happy about.I was also able to raise my standards of living quite a bit.My level of production used to be limited to the materials I could gather from the forest. But ever since school started, I had been able to pick up discarded items from classrooms and the various ongoing construction sites across campus. Through that, I obtained different types of materials that couldn't be found in the forest.There were several buildings currently being built under the support of \u2018The Golden Daughter, Lortel.\u2019 Thanks to her, there were quite a few construction sites on the outskirts of the academy. Snooping around earned me various construction materials. I was able to obtain leftover lumber, shabby and rusty nails, and ropes of ambiguous length. But my best find was a hand ax.Crack! Crack!The sound of smashing firewood resonated through the forest.I was using the base of a tree I had cut as my workbench to cut firewood. It may be worn out, but this discarded ax that the construction workers no longer used was my best find this month.Thank you to the manual laborers who left this lying around! I feel like crying\u2026!\u201cPhew\u2026 this is quite hard\u2026\u201dI cut the logs into large pieces with\u00a0Wind Blade, and then I cut them vertically with the hand ax.My\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0was just at a beginner level and wasn\u2019t powerful enough to cut down a whole tree.Because of this, I had actually been using small stems to maintain my campfire. But because their sizes were all different, and some even had moisture left in them, their efficiency and effectiveness weren\u2019t great.But now, if I were to use actual proper firewood, then my efficiency in managing the fire would increase tremendously.It was a pain to constantly take care of the campfire. And it was so crucial too, as I needed the heat at night to make sure no nearby wild animals would come close. It always needed constant maintenance.But the fire never lasted long due to the poor kindlings I had been using. There were even cases when it would waft in acrid smoke into the shelter after it had burned out.It was hard enough to find time to sleep during the day, and yet I would still lose sleep at night.\u201cPhew\u2026 Look at all this sweat\u2026\u201dMy casual clothes were already soaked in sweat.I would usually wash my casual clothes twice a day during weekends.Gathering herbs and edible plants, hunting, preparing my daily necessities, or even just inspecting the camp\u2026 every single moment of my life had become a series of aerobic exercises. There was never a day I was not sweating.I went back to the stream to wash myself off. Even though I was a few meters away, seeing my camp warmed my heart. I felt a sense of pride from seeing its appearance improve bit by bit.\u201c......\u201dHowever, I had been getting a certain uninvited guest a lot recently.I let out a sigh at seeing Lucy sleeping sluggishly on a flat rock by the stream.Ever since that first day, Lucy would often come by my camp and take a nap whenever she wanted.There was no sense of regularity to her visits. It seemed she just came by whenever she felt like it.\u201cHello.\u201dEven though we were not fully acquainted, we ended up greeting each other whenever she ran into me before she would go to sleep. Then she would be gone the next moment.I wanted to avoid getting close to an important character like Lucy Mayreel at first, but I eventually stopped thinking about it after a few days.I mean, Lucy Mayreel\u2019s visits were akin to natural disasters.I was in the middle of doing all my piled-up work this weekend, I didn\u2019t really have the capacity to waste any energy trying to get rid of a stray cat.And it wasn't like she was causing any harm. She would just lay down and sleep. Often, she would eat a couple of jerkies, and then she would leave when she wanted to.I just thought of her as a background piece. She widened her radius of actions around the camp too. She would sometimes sleep on top of trees or on the rocks by the stream, under the sun. She seemed to really like the stream a lot.Recently, I laid down dried leather from martens and squirrel furs as flooring in my shelter, and she made a fuss about liking how fluffy it was.Somehow, it really did feel like I was raising a cat\u2026?Zzz\u2026 Zzz\u2026I walked past Lucy to wash my face in the stream.The face reflected on the surface of the water looked completely wiped out from cutting all that firewood. I soaked my hands in the cool water to wet my face.Then I realized I hadn't checked my stats recently.......\u201cWhat???!!!\u201d\u201cEughakk?!\u201dMy scream woke Lucy up, and she ended up rolling off the rock.* * *[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 5Intelligence: 5Dexterity: 9Willpower: 7Luck:\u00a0 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226b\u201cHi, Ed! You look happy today! Did something good happen?\u201dOf course, there was!I had been steadily increasing my proficiency in both woodworking and magic, which had raised my Dexterity stat and Intelligence stat respectively.But that wasn't what was important.My Vitality stat had gone up a whole two points.What did this mean?It meant that my training had finally opened this damn body up which wasn't born with any physical ability.Although it would've been weirder had it not gone up at all, given how much physical work I had been doing all this month.However, this body wasn't born with any proper muscle strength, agility, or endurance. And no matter how much I trained, there had been no change in my Vitality so it was actually starting to break my heart.So I couldn\u2019t believe that it actually rose a whole two points!A wall that had been persistently blocking me had just broken down. I had now entered the next stage. From here on out, I would hope to be able to grow even further.How could I not be happy!But of course, there was no way I could show my happiness on the outside.\u201cWhat? Not really\u2026\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After the lecture, we students began to leave Professor Hela's Introductory Elemental Class one by one.Even though I had been replying as coldly as possible to Yennekara, she still kept on talking to me with a smile on her face, just like usual.\u201cHey, Ed! Uhm, you know about tomorrow's practical combat class? It's with the first years. And the groups have already been decided. Isn\u2019t it so nerve-wracking when you think about seeing them? I'm still not used to being an upperclassman, for some reason. Haha!\u201dSo tomorrow was already the practical class. I had no choice but to participate because it was mandatory.Just as the name implied, the joint combat class was a simulated one-on-one combat training. Of course, students wouldn't actually use real weapons or powerful magic.Students from the Combat Department were going to use fake weapons, while students from the Magic Department were only allowed to use beginner elemental magic. And those from the Alchemy Department were not allowed to use overly powerful drugs or spiritual skills.We wouldn't really be doing any sort of collaboration even though we were put in groups. It was a list of matches, more than anything.We were to conduct one-on-one practical battles according to the randomly created match schedule with the mixed years. Of course, these battles were to take place with everyone watching.The complete randomness of the placements allowed for various match combinations.A first-year vs first-year battle would be a good opportunity for inexperienced underclassmen to show off their skills while still getting advice from the upper years.A first-year vs second-year battle, on the other hand, would be a good opportunity for the first years to experience a more masterful battle through direct combat.Lastly, a second-year vs second-year battle would be a good opportunity for the first years to see the level of combat and magic skills they should be aiming for.The point was to watch all the battles.From what I could remember, all the important characters in the story would participate in this class. The class size was so large because everyone was supposed to participate regardless of their department.The Benevolent Princess Penia, The Golden Daughter Lortel, The Spear from Nature Ziggs, The Elementalist Yennekara, Hard Worker Emilla, Lazy Lucy, Gloomy Clevius, Romantic Adele\u2026There were an endless amount of characters.But the most important person was\u2026 The Failed Swordmaster Taylee.I already roughly knew the match list, which meant I knew who would win and who would lose. And even though frustrating, the first years would win almost every battle.The purpose of the joint class was for the first years to learn from the second years, but the first years were full of important characters that completely slaughtered the upperclassmen. Seeing Professor Glast applauding with a satisfied look on his face sure was a spectacle.But what could they do? If they were unhappy, then they should've been the main characters, haha!Although there was one second-year who won against a main character from the first year.Yennekara Palerover completely overwhelmed The Golden Daughter Lortel.To be fair, she herself was the final boss of Act 1, and this practical class was the first time she would appear in the story.\u201cEd, do you want to take a look?\u201dYennekara handed me the list of matches with a big smile on her face.\u2018No, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll check it later,\u2019 was what I was going to say to keep my distance. But then I became curious about who my opponent would be.Since I shouldn't even exist in the story at this point, I was worried there would be a big change in the match list due to me intervening.Most of the first years participating in this class were important characters in the story. I had been keeping my distance from such main characters, but this is the one time it couldn\u2019t be helped if I were to become their opponent.It wasn't like there was anything I could do given the nature of the class.So I should just stay calm and deal with whoever my opponent was.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, right here! Here you are! Come look!\u201dYennekar cheerfully handed me the list of matches, as if happy she had finally heard a proper response from me for once.Thankfully, there were no big changes. Most of them were still the matches I remember.All except for one.\u2018Match 13 - Ed Rothstaylor vs Penia Elias Kroel\u2019That name sounded familiar.\u201c......\u201dNo\u2026 Oh\u2026 My\u2026 God\u2026\u201c......\u201dIt shouldn't have been her\u2026* * *The royal residence was abuzz with the news.It seemed that newly stocked high-end clothes in the business district were in fashion.Products distributed by the Elte Company were selling like hotcakes.Princess Penia was not very pleased by this.\u201cThat fox-like merchant\u2019s scheme... I can see it clearly but\u2026\u201dPrincess Penia used her Insightful Eyes to gauge others, and they told her of the Golden Daughter Lortel\u2019s slyness inside of her. This was something unpleasant to the princess.She was one of the three Class A students recognized by Professor Glast from the class assignment exam. Lortel Kehelland was the only child of the best merchant on the continent and was a girl as sly as her father.She appeared to always be polite and upright, but she was actually hiding her true calculating nature of weighing everything on a scale of profit.The princess sat on her magnificent bed and sighed.Even this sacred place of learning was nothing more than a means to make money for Lortel. She wasn't using her magic talent, nor her outstanding brain capable of photographic memory, to study.The princess could feel it with her sixth sense. The Elte Company was gradually trying to take control of Silvenia\u2019s distribution channels, which was not completely irrelevant to the princess.\u201cI really don\u2019t like her\u2026 But I can\u2019t just deal with this only using my personal feelings\u2026\u201dThe princess buried herself in all sorts of magic books, documents, and bags scattered on her bed.\u201cAgain and again\u2026 I keep thinking about the kingdom and politics\u2026 Even though it\u2019s been a while since I've been here\u2026\u201dBut no matter how magnificent her royal residence may be, it would never match up to the actual thing.If she were at the castle, she wouldn't be able to lie down on her bed like this, nor would she be allowed to lay her reference books and documents all over her bed.Doing such inappropriate acts helped her feel like she was rebelling, but it also made her feel a sense of self-deprecation. And yet, it also made her feel a strange sense of satisfaction, as was only human.The princess stretched her body once again while smiling bitterly.\u201cKeughk! Phew\u2026 Alright\u2026 The most important thing is to develop myself through learning.\u201dWith that in mind, she checked the notice distributed to the first years. She had to carefully check everything related to that class.But after seeing the assigned groups for the joint combat practice, she buried herself in her bed once again.\u201cThis is just like the last time\u2026 this strange ill-fated relationship\u2026\u201dAfter agonizing for three days and three nights on whether to try and urge Ed Rothstaylor to leave the school, the princess ended up putting it on hold. Instead, she asked the head of her royal knights, Claire, and the dean of the Magic Department, Dean McDowell, to keep an eye on him. This was because he was an unusual person that the princess couldn\u2019t look through with her Insightful Eyes.She pushed back dealing with him as the semester started, and with her getting caught up in all sorts of things. But he was someone she couldn't just ignore.A man with a lot of unknowns. But he didn\u2019t seem to have any excellent talent with magic. The princess would probably win without much trouble.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be worrying so much.\u201dShe decided to go to sleep as she was on her soft bed. She didn't even take off her school uniform properly, nor did she organize her books scattered about. The first thing she wanted to do was relieve her fatigue. Of course, this was something unimaginable as part of the royal family.There were so many things she needed to pay attention to.Even though all Emperor Kroel wanted was for her to let everything go and just enjoy the joys of learning. He wanted her to ignore the kingdom and its politics and just enjoy her life as a student.But that simple task was too difficult for a young royal such as herself.This was the fate of a monarch, after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Joint Combat Practice (2)I didn't know who came up with the term \u2018butterfly effect\u2019, but I thought the concept behind it was amazing.The small fluttering of a butterfly's wings could cross oceans and cause a hurricane that could devour buildings on the other side of the world.It was in accordance with the Chaos Theory, which stated that there were too many natural variables in the world for us to actually control the future.Even the slightest change in a variable could have an exponential effect on the outcome of reality.To put it simply, it was like a snowball rolling down a mountain. No matter how insignificant it may be at the top, it could eventually have an unexpectedly big result once it reaches the bottom.Just like the words of the wise said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t try to control everything in the world as you wish.\u2019I never thought I would realize the weight of those words in this Joint Combat Practice class.As expected, old sayings were never wrong.* * *Nail Hall had traditionally been used for joint combat classes as one of the three buildings in the Student Center.It was a well-designed colosseum-style arena where all the spectator seats, as well as the floor, were always polished clean and smooth.Of course, even the training ground for sparring and fighting in an academy for the nobility would be made with such dignity.I was sitting in one of these spectator seats while I watched the mock combat practice happening in the center of the colosseum.Usually, there would only be one or two gems in each year, but this year's batch of freshmen was like a sky full of bright stars. This meant the second years were bound to be focused, watching the whole time.Among these stars were the three students recognized by the strict Professor Glast: Spear from Nature Ziggs, Golden Daughter Lortel and Lazy Lucy.Everyone's attention was completely focused on these three freshmen from the Magic Department.Bang!\u201cThank you for the great experience. I was deeply impressed by your experienced management of magic. I learned something from you today, so thank you for that.\u201dDown the center was Ziggs, a descendant of the northern nomadic people, who was in the midst of throwing a second year off the stage with his wind magic.His long curly hair that reached the nape of his neck waved in the aftermath.\u201cI hope I can learn something from you again next time.\u201dHe politely gave his greetings.At any rate, this guy wasn\u2019t out of his mind.The second-year Magic Department student who went up against Zigg\u2026 what was his name? Was it Michael?Anyway, he couldn't pull himself up together so the staff had to carry him out.Using non-beginner magic was not allowed. But if it was\u2026Zigg's magic skills far exceed the level of beginner magic spells. I was certain he could have shown a much stronger performance had he been allowed to use higher levels of magic.The second years began to gossip amongst themselves.- \u201cThe first years won again.\u201d- \u201cAt this rate, won\u2019t all the second-years lose?\u201d- \u201cThis year's freshmen are an odd bunch. How did all these monsters end up together in one batch?\u201dThe Joint Combat Practice was an annual event, but the results this year were terrible. The second-years were mercilessly overshadowed by the first-years. We were already halfway through the matches, and it felt like the second-years were nothing but punching bags for the first-years so they could show off their skills.It was quite a sad scene.\"The students whose names are called, please proceed to the waiting room after your preparations. Lucy Mayreel. Taylee McLaure.\"The time has finally come. The match the people were most interested in.The audience began to whisper amongst themselves.It's finally here.I adjusted my posture and shifted my focus completely on the stage.Everyone would probably be focused solely on Lucy, the extraordinary genius who was touted to rewrite the history of Silvenia Academy.But this was nothing more than a storytelling technique to bring attention to the real main character through reversing expectations.The real focus here was Taylee McLaure, the protagonist of this world who was born fated to become a swordsman.Even though he had never held a sword in his life before, he would be able to cut down Lucy\u2019s lightning-fast magic.Taylee would use that gap in her carelessness to close the distance. And Lucy, having been caught off guard, would use the intermediate lightning magic\u00a0Lightning Strike\u00a0to hit Taylee.Taylee would be completely overpowered by Lucy\u2019s instinctive magic, but since she had used an intermediate spell, Lucy would get disqualified and Taylee would be honored the win.\"This is to remind first-year student Lucy Mayreel to please finish your preparations and come up to the arena.\"Ah\u2026 it was a really great scene.All his life, Taylee had constantly been treated and told that he wasn\u2019t talented. Even after getting accepted into Silvenia, he was still treated as a failure. From getting bullied by a guy like Ed Rothstaylor to always getting failing scores in his combat class, Taylee\u2019s life truly was full of ordeals.But Taylee never stopped training. And this match was the moment when he felt like everything he had done until then had finally been rewarded.The directing of the scene was so dramatic. The close-up shot of him crying while looking at his childhood friend Ayla was truly heartbreaking to witness.\"I repeat, first-year student Lucy Mayreel. First-year student Lucy Mayreel. Please finish preparing for your battle and come up to the arena.\"......?\"First-year Lucy Mayreel. I repeat, first-year Lucy Mayreel. Please come up to the arena. Lucy Mayreel.\"Uh\u2026What's going on?Where the hell did that girl go???* * *It was hard to describe the strange sense of euphoria I felt the moment I saw Taylee in the arena.Even though it had only been through a screen, I had lived as him several times. From the miserable bad ending to the unforgettable true ending\u2013I had lived through his life and journeys.I also couldn\u2019t help but think of all the hardships that lie ahead of him.Although he was born fated to be a swordsman, his life wasn\u2019t always destined for success. Among the many routes in his life he could take, there wasn\u2019t a single path that wasn\u2019t difficult.So I decided to cheer him on.I had planned on taking care of my life and living it to the fullest, while he would be the one to step in and take care of all the ordeals that would befall Silvenia.\u201cI will do my best with all the power that I have!\u201dA round of applause and encouragement greeted Taylee\u2019s strong declaration on stage.Yes, you could probably call it encouragement, because everyone in the arena believed he would get destroyed by Lucy Mayreel.What they didn\u2019t know was that Taylee actually possessed the most overwhelming talent among all the students in the academy.As someone who already knew how the whole story would go, I expected the public\u2019s opinion to change in the future.Well, there\u2019s that.And then there was this.What was I even doing right now\u2026\u201cEughk, Ahhhk!\u201dI pinched both of Lucy\u2019s Mayreel\u2019s cheeks.Lucy got bored pretending to listen to the class, so she ended up looking for a place to take a nap. She somehow found her way to the spare podium behind the center stage of the arena.It wouldn\u2019t have been a good idea to completely leave Nail Hall, so she probably thought that the spare podium was a good enough place to take a nap in.I found her there, curled up and sleeping.\u201cAgghk, Eughkk!\u201d\u201cHey, wake up. Wake up already. It\u2019s your turn!\u201dShe took a while to wake up, but Lucy finally sat up from underneath the podium.She had the same blank face as she would normally have after waking up at my camp. Even her tangled hair, one side of it was tied down while the other had come undone. There wasn't even any room for her hair to stick on her cheeks.And the words she said the moment she woke up were the same as well.\u201c...I\u2019m hungry.\u201dShe brushed her hair and stretched some more. Then she looked at me and said her usual greetings.\u201cHello.\u201dAnd then she asked oh so casually and naturally.\u201cDo you have any beef jerky?\u201dI seriously wanted to hit her in the head.\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cGive me some.\u201d\u201cFinish your duel first.\u201d\"First-year student Lucy Mayreel. Please hurry and come on up.\"It was bizarre to see one of the dueling opponents pop out from under the podium. Everyone in the audience, including the assistant professor who was in charge, watched Lucy with a puzzled face.The important thing was she didn't ditch class and run outside of Nail Hall. This meant they could still have the duel. For a moment, I was afraid the duel would get canceled and completely change Taylee\u2019s fate.\u201cEughhhhhk!\u201dLucy stood up and the messy half of her hair completely fell off its hair tie, her neatly tied hair falling apart.\u201c......\u201dLucy gathered the hair that had escaped and picked up the tie. Then she handed it over to me and, in a drowsy voice, said something utterly ridiculous.\u201cPlease tie my hair\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, just leave it untied and go quickly.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026. If I just leave it like this, the Ophelis Hall maids will scold me. They\u2019re way too scary\u2026\u201dThe maid of Ophelis Hall were the only people whom Lucy, someone who had even tried to compete with Headmaster Obel, feared.The only reason why Lucy had been able to maintain a neat appearance despite sleeping wherever whenever was thanks to the maids of Ophelis Hall.They were a group of elite maids trained to serve all kinds of nobles, but even such professionals couldn't seem to control this unpredictable stray cat. They probably couldn't help but get angry and scold Lucy for her actions.But it was a relief they could at least still somehow control her\u2026I sighed as I grabbed Lucy\u2019s hand and sat her down. I held her hair tie as I gathered up her wayward hair, and then tied it neatly to match the other side.I was supposed to duel with Princess Penia later, but it was ridiculous how I had to interfere with someone else's duel.And everyone in Nail Hall was watching the whole spectacle!- \u201cWhat\u2019s with that person? Isn't that Ed Rothstaylor?\u201d- \u201cHe still attends school? Wow, he\u2019s quite stubborn, huh?\u201d- \u201cWhat\u2019s with him? He\u2019s having a grand ol' time with the first-year top student just like that?\u201d- \u201cThey look close?\u201d- \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s close? Isn\u2019t he acting more like her guardian?\u201dI knew it was quite a sight to see the most disgraceful second-year student and the most honorable top first-year student nagging each other over fixing her hair. It made me feel embarrassed so I finished tying it up quickly.Then Lucy stood up, still half-asleep, and I also fixed her overcoat for her. Then I tucked the hem of her shirt back inside her skirt and tightened it well, and even straightened her messy collar.I then fixed up her falling knee socks and re-tied her hair again so she would look somewhat presentable. Her sleeves were a bit long, but she never really cared about the size of her uniform and only wore whatever she received.\u201cYou\u2019re good?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAll right. Hurry up and go out there.\u201dI shoved Lucy\u2019s back and pushed her up to the stage.And she stood there, across from Taylee, yawning loudly, as if everything in the world was annoying.\"Then the duel will start\u2026\"Bang!With a single blow, right in the middle of Taylee\u2019s chest, Lucy hit him with low-level lighting magic.It all happened in about 0.3 seconds.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Taylee McLaure\u2019s life had always been a series of ordeals.Born as a country bumpkin, he was a failure of a student who had never performed well since entering the academy, a loser who had never been recognized by anyone.Apart from his childhood friend Ayla, nobody had ever believed in Taylee ever since he was a kid.No matter what he did, his results were always below-average that even his family had slowly begun to turn their backs on him.But then a chance to forget everything had come.For Taylee, his admission into Silvenia Academy was a means to prove himself. It was as if God had finally smiled down on him.He barely managed to pass the written test after staying up night after night studying.He even almost failed his practical test because of a despicable upperclassman. But thanks to the mercy of Princess Penia, he was able to pass.And not only that, he had somehow overcome all the other hardships and challenges that kept on coming his way once the semester started.He almost lost his life to an accidentally summoned monster-type kobold during the placement test. Then he couldn't attend the opening ceremony because of some classmates who had kept him out, calling him a failure of a student.But thanks to the unwavering support of his childhood friend Ayla, along with Aiden, another student who was also in danger of failing classes, Taylee was somehow able to endure it.And right now, this was the moment to prove it.Not only to the first-years, but also to the upperclassmen and even the professors, all of whom couldn't help but be in awe at the extraordinarily rare genius that was Lucy Mayreel.He was in a brutal situation where everyone expected him to lose.But even in this moment full of despair, Taylee never lost hope.Lucy wasn't someone he could beat with just meager efforts. Despite all the ridicule he received from his classmates, Taylee stayed up all night, training his body, swinging his fists, and constantly training in hand-to-hand combat.Even until this moment, when everyone believed he would lose, Taylee never stopped putting in the effort to try and win.And right now.Before he could even react, a single blow of magic had struck him and left him hanging off the wall of the stadium.\u201cKeuk\u2026 Heughk\u2026Eughkk\u2026\u201dNevertheless, Taylee stood up.Scattered around him were all kinds of weapons, from bows to swords to whips.They were mock weapons prepared for the students of the Combat Department. Most of them had no blades and were modified to be blunt.Taylee looked at the knuckles in his hand. They were a weapon that had been with him for a long time. But today, he quietly took them off.A sense that struck like lightning went through Taylee's mind.He saw a shabby wooden sword amongst the scattered weapons. His body jumped out of instinct and picked up the broken sword from the floor. Then he got into position, his body covered in wounds.It was the first time he had ever picked up a sword in his life.His opponent was an extremely rare genius magician whom everyone was in awe of.Nevertheless, Taylee stood up with the support of his two legs.There were people who believed in him. Taylee had to repay them for that.Taylee clenched his teeth with that single thought in mind.* * *\u201cHe picked up a sword\u2026!\u201dI held my breath the moment I saw Taylee hanging off the wall, but clenched my fist as soon as he grabbed the sword.That\u2019s right\u2026 You could do it\u2026!\u201cLucy Mayreel!\u201dTaylee shouted out Lucy\u2019s name with a fiery voice.Even I, who was only watching from the audience, felt that something was going to happen.That\u2019s right. This was the scene right here!The scene where Taylee, who never gave up despite destiny abandoning him, dealt with all the challenges and trials the world threw at him\u2026 this was the scene where he sends a signal of his revival.This was the cry of a swordsman who didn't give up on his life, and would always be engraved into the hearts of all the students... It was this moment.\u201cHyaaa!\u201dHis movements were not of someone who was holding a sword for the first time.There was a sensation of mana engraved on the low-grade wooden sword in Taylee\u2019s hands. That was a sensation allowed only to those who were fated to be a swordsman.It was the Energy of Aura.Even a thick wall of several layered stacks of mana could be cut like paper.The students in the audience began to become overwhelmed by his vigor.It was a sign that Taylee had clearly changed.All the students held their breath. They couldn\u2019t help but anticipate that something extraordinary was about to happen.But then an unknown wind blew past.And with a sudden gale that swooped in for no reason, Taylee\u2019s body began to float in the air in an instant.Bang!In the ensuing lighting magic, Taylee was struck again and thrown against the wall.This time, it took about 0.5 seconds.\u201cHuh?\u201d* * *It was a perfect knockdown this time.A cloud of thick smoke billowed out, and beneath it all was Taylee\u2019s body, completely covered in wounds.\u201cHeungggg....\u201dLucy Mayreel rubbed her eyes while stretching her body lazily.\u201cGood work\u2026\u201dLucy came down off the stage, carefree as can be, as if she had done an annoying trivial task.The audience was still completely silent. Everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on her.Lucy bounced her way over to me and ignored it all, as if nothing had happened. Then she grabbed my collar, her face blank, and started bothering me again.\u201cCan you give me the beef jerky now?\u201dMeanwhile, I came to a realization.The wind magic that Lucy used during the duel looked to be beginner wind magic at first glance, but she didn't use it on her own. I knew what magic it was, magic that could momentarily constrain the opponent's movement and create a gap by breaking the balance.It was\u00a0Storms Blessing. A skill that can only be acquired by signing a contract with the high-ranking wind spirit Merilda.It hadn't been a long time since Lucy had started coming to my camp. A few days at most.She always looked tired and would take naps, yet she was able to sign a contract with a high-ranking wind spirit.Merilda and Lucy were completely separated in the original storyline. They never got involved with each other because Lucy never had any reason to visit the northern forest.Does this mean she had been able to make contact with Merilda because she had been staying at my camp? And through that, she was able to use Merilda\u2019s Blessing, inadvertently becoming unnecessarily stronger.That's just\u2026No one could ever imagine signing a contract with a high-ranking wind spirit in just a few days.\u201c......\u201dI looked towards where Taylee was. He had dropped his sword and sat there, collapsed with his head down. The life that was normally in his eyes was no longer there.The overwhelming gap in their talent must've felt like violence. The realization that a huge wall existed between the both of them\u2026 his heart must have broken in an instant.This was\u2026 I think I may be in big trouble\u2026I quickly stood up from my seat. I couldn\u2019t just leave him there like that.I pushed away Lucy who was sticking to me and walked over to Taylee who was coming down from the stage in total despair.\"The next contenders in the combat practice are Ed Rothstaylor and the honorable Princess Penia Elias Kroel.\"Meanwhile, my name was already being called.I saw Princess Penia in the audience, neatly arranging her clothes and standing up.I ran into the princess on my way to the arena a while ago. Her eyes became aggressive the minute she saw him, just like usual. The fact that she was hostile towards me was nothing new.She seemed to have already made up her mind when it came to me. But Princess Penia was not my concern at this moment.\u201cEd Rothstaylor\u2026 Last time, you\u2026.\u201dI walked past her just as the princess started to say something. Taylee would have completely left if I were to stay still.The act of ignoring the words of the princess of the nation was an unpardonable sin, but here in the academic district, the virtue of learning precedes one\u2019s status, so I wouldn't have to face capital punishment, at the very least.After all, there was something more important than that.I left behind the princess who completely looked shocked at having been ignored. I saw Taylee just as he was disappearing amongst the crowd and shouted out towards him.\u201cHey! Taylee!\u201dI don\u2019t know if this would make any difference, but it was better than staying still.\u201cYour efforts will be rewarded! Don\u2019t be discouraged! Hey! Straighten your back! There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of!\u201dIf Taylee\u2019s heart was broken and he became completely discouraged, there was a high chance that I would likely suffer as a result, I couldn't just leave him like that.\u201cWalk with confidence! You did a good job! This was only because your opponent was too good! Don\u2019t be discouraged by something like this!\u201dPlease don\u2019t be disheartened, Taylee!You were destined to go through all the hardships! There were going to be so many challenges and trials that would arise in this academy in the future! I didn\u2019t want to be the one to do the saving!I kept shouting words of encouragement and support as Taylee slowly walked away and completely disappeared into the crowd.It was pure desperation from the bottom of my heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Joint Combat Practice (3)\u201cPenia, you were born with God\u2019s blessing.\u201dThe first person to recognize Penia\u2019s Insightful Eyes was her father, Emperor Kroel.An emperor's life was nothing but an endless parade of secret battles and conspiracies. And since her father only ever showed his honorable side to the public, no one could have ever guessed how dirty was the darkness he was hiding.And the emperor was wrong about Penia's Insightful Eyes.It was not a present from god. It was something she had acquired from trying to protect herself from a depressing abyss.She had complete confidence in her ability.She had been able to read the chancellor's eyes, filled with intent to poison her aunt. She had seen the duchess's desire to turn her son into royalty. She had glimpsed the trembling eyes of a worker trying to steal a golden chain from the bedroom, and had heard the unstable footsteps of a leader who tried to embezzle the knights' armament funds. She had even felt the gaze of a young royal who was jealous of her power, and noticed the trembling voice of a spy disguised as a maid to collect information.Oh, the princess knew of the dark abyss underneath every royal\u2019s gaze that looked up to her benevolence.But despite knowing everybody's darkest secrets, she had always led her life acting as if she knew nothing.\u201cI look forward to working with you.\u201dShe looked straight at the boy who greeted her so politely.The princess had a unique level of sixth sense. A higher level of intuition than her would require mind-reading.* * *- \u201cHahaha! What\u2019s with him?! Isn't that Ed Rothstaylor? He was always wearing fancy clothes and jewelry, but now, he looks like a peasant!\u201d- \u201cThat frugal appearance suits him quite well!\u201d- \u201cHe was always arrogant, but it\u2019s finally going to be revealed he actually has no talent in magic.\u201dThe students' whispers could be heard all the way down to the arena. It seemed they wanted to mock and belittle Ed as much as they could, but couldn't because they had to behave in front of the princess of the kingdom.\u201cYes, I look forward to working with you as well.\u201dShe gently raised her hand and felt the flow of her magic, her condition at its best. One of the important characteristics of an impressive archmage was to always take care of one's body.She narrowed her eyes at the boy across from her.\u201cYour efforts will be rewarded! Don\u2019t be discouraged! Hey! Straighten your back! There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of!\u201d\u201cWalk with confidence! You did a good job! This was only because your opponent was too good! Don\u2019t be discouraged by something like this!\u201dEd Rothstaylor shouted at the student who was in danger of failing the class, all the while ignoring her, the princess of the nation.But rather than be surprised that he disrespected her, what surprised the princess more was the urgency in Ed's voice.- \u201cDid you hear him yelling at Taylee earlier? He\u2019s seriously quite stubborn.\u201d- \u201cHa\u2026 even after bullying him earlier this year, he's still making a fuss. He really should stop picking on that weakling.\u201d- \u201cMaybe he just wanted to try and act nice. Something like, 'At least I'm helping him now, even though I bullied him before'? Maybe he\u2019s thinking something like that.\u201d- \u201cWow, his intentions are quite shady then.\u201d- \u201cWasn't he someone like this in the first place?\u201dThe audience's words could no longer be considered whispering.Even the princess could hear them all the way down where she was. There was no way Ed Rothstaylor hadn't heard them.But his eyes remained calm. His pupils didn't even tremble one bit.It was easy for the princess to read his emotions through his eyes.Indifference. Apathy. But otherwise good.It was a familiar feeling, the same feeling from that time she saw Ed at his camp. Ed had always been this kind of person. The audience's mocking whispers didn't even leave a scratch on his heart.There were many people like Ed. People who tend to have an indifferent attitude, born with calm temperance regardless of what others may say.These were people who believed themselves to be the center of their lives. This firm belief ingrained in their hearts wouldn't be shaken by the will of others.There was no need to look far for such people. The first years were full of them.Students like Lucy Mayreel, the Golden Daughter Lortel, and Spear from Nature Ziggs.The princess felt relieved at the thought. Somehow, this made Ed seem more human.It took a while for her to accept it, but he was somehow a level above the princess's Insightful Eyes. It was why he was able to take his stance with such conviction.However, his puzzling words from earlier and that of ignoring the princess\u2026Ed was wholeheartedly encouraging a first-year student, someone he had tried to fail before. The contrast made the princess feel dizzy.Just when the princess thought she had him figured out, he would do something like this and become like slippery fish that would torment her.Was he yelling at Taylee to make fun of him?Was it all a two-faced stunt to make up for what he did while cheering Taylee on?Without knowing his motivations, his actions did appear to support the audience's speculations.But the princess saw his sincere desperation from a while ago, something he had never shown before.If he had appealed to her the same way back when they met at his camp, then the princess wouldn't have such a headache over him right now.\"Please don\u2019t expel me from school. I\u2019m sincerely reflecting on my actions. Please give me a chance.\"Had he appealed like that with all his strength, had he fallen on his knees and rubbed his hands together, she wouldn\u2019t be feeling so uncomfortable.So many people already bow their heads and desperately appeal in front of her anyway.But he treated his expulsion with indifference, the same way he was taking all the mocking and ridicule from the audience.However, his reaction to the heartbroken first-year student who failed was not indifference but unnatural desperation, something sincere from his heart.\u201cYou're making me confused, Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dThe princess sighed.Was this something to use this much energy on?She was tired of getting swayed by Ed's unpredictable behavior.He was just\u2026 a student whose nobility was stripped off him.He wasn't someone corrupt, dreaming of overthrowing the royal family. Nor was he a corrupt prime minister embezzling public funds, or a disgraceful staff who tried to steal a royal\u2019s wealth.Who cares if her Insightful Eyes cannot gauge him?Yes, this duel was an opportunity to take care of this once and for all. To end it all here.The princess managed to calm herself down. This was her chance to fight Ed Rothstaylor, who she couldn\u2019t understand at all.\u201cI want to end it all cleanly with this duel.\u201dThere were so many unknown things in this world. As long as there was a simple way to take care of it, it didn't matter. The context of it wasn't important. Just because she couldn't figure him out doesn't mean it's the end of the world.She was already gauging the amount of mana Ed Rothstaylor had. It wasn\u2019t an amazing amount, but the natural way he controlled the flow of his magic meant he wasn't an easy opponent.This was the first march between a second year and a first year. Therefore, a handicap that they could only use beginner-level magic was out in place to even out their fighting power.You could tell that Ed has had a lot of practice using beginner elemental magic by the way he could control the flow of his magic through his body. It was hard to say how much intermediate elemental magic he could use, but he was, at the very least, skilled with beginner magic.The princess's magic skill was not as impressive as Lucy\u2019s or Lortel. But she had never neglected her magic training due to her diligence.\"Please start your match now.\"Princess Penia got into position.The first strike. It was usually used to measure your opponent's skills.The princess's water elemental magic specialized in anomalous attacks. It wouldn't be easy to respond to the sudden changes in her attack\u2019s movements.\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201dThe princess raised her hand, where the beginner elemental magic\u00a0Water Ball\u00a0was formed.Using magic to form a mass of water was a tricky technique. It could surprise the enemy through his blind spots, applying great pressure.She was capable of summoning up to five\u00a0Water Balls\u00a0at once, allowing her to attack from all directions. However, to gauge Ed's skills first, she only summoned one.His elemental magic was wind and fire. How would he respond?The princess planned to change her strategy according to how Ed would react. She was thinking of increasing her magic output little by little, fighting with all of her power.Through this one last dramatic battle, Princess Penia wanted to forget everything that she could about Ed Rothstaylor, an enigma she could not understand.There were so many other things she could pay attention to aside from him.She threw her\u00a0Water Ball\u00a0with all her might, the mass of water changing directions as it soared to attack Ed.The princess saw it. His eyes were following the\u00a0Water Ball\u2019s\u00a0path. Would he use wind? How would he defend himself? And after his defense, what should be the follow-up blow\u2013Bang!Her\u00a0Water Ball\u00a0hit Ed right in the abdomen.His body flew through the air before rolling on the floor. A pile of dust rose from where he landed. He had completely fallen, sprawled out on the floor.\u201c... I lost.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dPrincess Penia\u2019s eyes began to tremble.- \u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201d- \u201cWow! What the hell was that! He was more useless than Taylee!\u201d- \u201cHe acted all cool but fell down at once!\u201d- \u201cPrincess Penia! You\u2019re so cool! That was amazing!\u201dThe audience cheered and applauded her win. They sounded extremely happy to see the public enemy fall down, defeated.But that wasn't what it looked like from where the princess stood across from him.Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s eyes were following her Water Ball\u2019s movement as it flew right into him.It wasn't that he couldn\u2019t stop it.It was that he\u00a0didn't\u00a0stop it.\u201cJust what are you\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat match. Thanks to you, I learned a lesson today, princess.\u201dHe took off his dueling guards and stood up, meeting her eyes as he gave his greetings.It was then that Princess Penia realized he hadn't made eye contact with her until now.He never had any interest in their duel from the very beginning.Princess Penia felt as though something hot was stuck in her throat, and it wouldn't disappear. The uncomfortable feeling she tried to shake off through this fight had now started to swallow her whole.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Was this really the time for a duel?I quickly walked off the arena as fast as I could. The childish mockery and ridicule the students welcomed me with today\u2026 It must have been great to see me get knocked down so easily after one shot from the princess.\u201cTaylee\u2026 where did that guy go?\u201dThere was a prioritized order for everything. And everything had a set level of importance.It was important to minimize the impact as carefully as possible when in contact with Princess Penia. This was so I wouldn't affect the story as the princess was an extremely important person in the game.But Taylee, as the main character of this world, was even more important than the princess.If he were to completely succumb to this ordeal and get disheartened, it would form a fatal flaw in my grand plan of taking advantage of him so I could graduate.I had to do something no matter what. It didn't matter how important of a person the princess was. She couldn't be more important than having Taylee move past this.\u201cAnyways, finding Taylee is my first priority.\u201dLeaving behind their taunts and mockery, I rushed down the hallway leading to the exit of Nail Hall. The class wasn't over yet, but I should be able to mix well among the crowd and leave unnoticed.As long as I find a way to help Taylee come to his senses, I could just work hard to cover for the things that would affect my grades.I took long strikes with that thought in mind, noticing there was another person behind me.\u201cEd Rothstaylor!\u201dThe princess had surprisingly jumped down from the arena and followed me. Her Vitality might be low as she was leaning against the wall, catching her breath.I looked back at the princess, puzzled beyond words.\u201cHuh? Princess Penia, for you to have come all the way here without your knights\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make that face like you don\u2019t know anything!\u201dHonestly, the princess shouting at me with a voice full of contempt was a bit surprising. Was she ever this kind of character in the game?No, the better question was, was there even anything that could have made her so mad?\u201cEvery time\u2026 Being unsure if it\u2019s wrong or right\u2026 Do you know how frustrating it is to have to measure a person like that?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I am not sure what you are talking about. If it\u2019s about the duel, I have learned a lesson thanks to you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean learned a lesson\u2026!\u201dI could clearly see her clenched fists shaking. She must be seriously angry.\u201cPrincess Penia, please\u2026 calm down.\u201d\u201cYou never thought of winning from the beginning. All you thought about was getting off the arena as quickly as possible!\u201d\u201cPrincess Penia, your voice is too loud\u2026\u201dThe princess was not the type of person to be flustered enough and show it publicly like this. This was completely unexpected, coming from her.Princess Penia was a royal who hated using her authority to oppress people. She was also a noble who never forgets the value of her dignity at all times.So to put pressure on, shake her fists at, and raise her voice, all without dignity, to someone beneath her power\u2026 it went against her own beliefs. And if someone were to see or hear this, the rumors won't be pretty.I tried to calm her down first.\u201cIt's already hard enough to keep up with my classes, but that fox-like merchant keeps hiding her intentions and is trying to devour the whole academy for her own gain! And Professor Glast\u2019s temper isn\u2019t getting any better! Meanwhile, people around me kept mentioning the royal laws\u2026 even if I didn't want to, I had to pay attention to them! It's all too difficult!\u201dHad she always had this much pent-up anger?But why was she unloading all of this on me? Was it a sin to have a duel with her? I get that she had a lot of built-up frustrations inside of her, but she wasn't going to have all of that explode on me, was she?\u201cPrincess, please calm down.\u201dReady to be criticized for my insulting actions, I touched the princess's royal body, putting both of my hands on her shoulders and making eye contact.\u201cTake a deep breath.\u201dAs my hands wrapped around her shoulders, the princess took a deep breath. No one would dare touch the princess of this kingdom. But in a situation where it was just the two of us alone\u2026 she was probably surprised by my sudden touch.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get too agitated. Just take a deep breath, in and out.\u201dThe princess listened and took a few deep breaths, in and out\u2026In such situations, people generally feel uncomfortable after regaining their composure.\u201cAhh\u2026 Ack\u2026!\u201dPrincess Penia realized how undignified she had been acting and covered her face.This was her moment of realization, the embarrassment coming back to her all at once.\u201cUhm\u2026 About earlier\u2026 Please forget all of it\u2026\u201dGreat idea!\u201cUh\u2026 Of course\u2026\u201dThe princess had her hand covering her face for a while, red from extreme embarrassment.So... was she good now?Could I go now?\u201cYes, I know I have a bad habit of trying to figure out people and piecing together their secret plans, even though I know it's fine to simply ask questions if there are things I'm wondering about. I guess it's because I grew up in the royal family.\u201dShe started talking about things that nobody asked her about.No, I got it! I\u2019ll listen to you some other time and give you my sincere reaction then!Just let me go first! I need to find Taylee!!!!\u201cThat bad habit\u2026 I knew I had it but\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t just tell the princess to her face,\u00a0\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t care. Just please let me go. It\u2019s urgent. I\u2019m busy.\u2019\u00a0So I had to nod my head for now.\u201cI see. Princess, then\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, let me ask you straight.\u201dWhat now?!\u201cThis is what I think: you knew something about the secret darkness within the Rothstaylor family, or you were hurt by them, so you tried to cut your ties with the whole family. But you needed some type of justification to be excommunicated, so you bullied a student named Taylee. Is that correct?\u201dThe Princess continued to talk while keeping eye contact with me. It was quite a sharp deduction. Most of it was wrong, but the reasoning about the dark side of the Rothstaylor family was correct.I may have mentioned it before, but the head of the Rothstaylor household, Lord Krepin Rothstaylor, was studying the magic of immortality with the power of Mebula, an evil god of the Mythic Age. In the process, many people were sacrificed as experiments.But that was something the princess would directly investigate by mobilizing the academic affairs power vested in her in the second half of the story. That part was still a long way to go.\u201cSo if you know something about the darkness of the Rothstaylor family\u2026\u201dWas there a reason to tell her?\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\u201c...There\u2019s no way.\u201dThe princess quickly interrupted my answer.\u201cLogically, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why did you just shout at Taylee? Why are you encouraging and supporting the person you were trying to get kicked out of school? You didn\u2019t hate Taylee in the first place, did you?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201dHey, this kid, why are her questions quite sharp?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I was just teasing him. Or\u2026 uhm\u2026 that\u2026 well.. hmm\u2026 Well everyone hates me, right? So when I cheered for Taylee, I wanted to show them a different side of me\u2026 Won\u2019t they see that side of me then\u2026? Something like that\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyone can tell that\u2019s a lie!\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not lying\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something that helps me judge another person better than anyone else. It\u2019s my pride, my Insightful Eyes.\u201dThe princess raised her head and spoke clearly. It was true. The Benevolent Princess Penia was unrivaled when it came to judging people.\u201cEven if everyone in the world believed you, I clearly saw through you, even for just a moment. And that moment you encouraged Taylee, you were really desperate.\u201dNo, I had no choice but to be extremely desperate\u2026 I\u2019ll be screwed if he gets disheartened\u2026But that was something I couldn\u2019t explain to her. Instead, I decided to use the \u2018absolute defense strategy\u2019 that everybody all around the world used. From elementary school students, all the way to grownups.\u201cI\u2019m serious\u2026\u201dDo you have proof?You don\u2019t have proof, right?You only have your suspicions, right???\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s true\u2026 I\u2019m telling the truth\u2026\u201dThis strategy left no room for an argument. Even if she had her Insightful Eyes, because I said it wasn't, then it wasn't. If she were to keep bringing it up, she would have no choice but to bring physical evidence.\u201cI\u2019m serious\u2026 it\u2019s the truth\u2026\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 Seriously\u2026!\u201dAt this point, without manner or class, the princess grabbed her hair with both hands, her expression crazy with frustration. She stomped her feet and kept saying the same thing.There was nowhere to relieve her anger and frustrations so she trampled on the pavement.\u201cAHHH! SERIOUSLY!!!\u201dBeing so close to finding out the truth, only to have it repeatedly escape and run away from her would definitely leave her frustrated enough for steam to come out of her head. Not just for a day or two, but for several weeks.On top of that, her Insightful Eyes had always allowed her to see through anyone easily. As this was a new experience for her, she was bound to be two or three times more frustrated and suffocated.But there was nothing I could do. It was my responsibility to make sure the future was stable and moved along as smoothly as possible.If someone else was in my place\u2026 would they have been willing to tell her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Joint Combat Practice (4)Princess Penia's Head Escort, Claire, difficulty chased after the princess, her charge having jumped off the arena and running towards the exit.The princess barely managed to calm down as she saw Claire approaching.No matter how furious she was, she still had to maintain her royal status. She wasn't in a position to show such undignified behavior in front of her royal knight.\u201cI can\u2019t give up on how things are currently.\u201dShe approached me with an ill-tempered look, her anger not having completely subsided.\u201cYou know something, don\u2019t you? Surely\u2026 Whether you are bearing the weight of it or hiding it\u2026 I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t talking, or maybe you\u2019re being forced to, but I can tell that there\u00a0is\u00a0something. I can't feel any malicious or dark intent inside you but\u2026\u201d\u201cI think you may be overestimating yourself, princess\u2026.\u201d\u201cListen carefully. I can\u2019t say anything right now because I don\u2019t have any evidence but\u2026\u201dThe princess\u2019s bright golden eyes looked straight at me.As expected of a main character. The more I thought about it, the more I remembered just how important of a role Princess Penia and Lucy Mayreel had.It was difficult to act appropriately in front of the princess's Insightful Eyes.Just like how she caught me in my brief moment of desperation earlier, her sharp sixth sense didn't allow for even a moment of carelessness.In \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019, Princess Penia\u2019s Insightful Eyes was just a simple ability that allowed her to know an opponent\u2019s next action in advance during battle, or to peek at an opponent\u2019s stats.But aside from that, it was treated as nothing more than a plot device.However, living in this reality myself, actually facing her ability in my daily life had caused me much mental anguish.I knew it. It was better to keep as much distance away from the princess as possible.Although it would never happen as she was a main character, I needed to make sure to never become close to her. I felt like I was starting to care too much about it.Of course, I wasn't sure if it would be easy to keep my distance. It would all depend on my effort from now on.\u201cHow sure are you that you would get your answer as long as you figure out the vague outline of the situation?\u201dThe princess let out a sigh. She seemed to finally realize how funny and ridiculous this whole situation was.She put her hands on her waist and let out another sigh, finally regaining her composure.\u201cAnyway\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I yelled and showed disgraceful behavior towards you.\u201dShe swept her hand over her face, seemingly recalling the terrible way she had acted earlier.Well, even though she was furious, at least the conversation ended with an apology from the princess.The difference in status between us was enormous. If she was even slightly irritated, it could have had catastrophic results for me.This was an unprecedented situation in the first place. Princess Penia had rarely gotten annoyed or angry at others, the reason for which was quite complicated.I knew about some instances in the princess's childhood which made it understandable why she had such an unnaturally altruistic and caring personality.When she was young, she pointed out a slight stain on her teacup.\u00a0 This resulted in a maid she was friendly with getting whipped in the royal garden.The royal family was always conscious of the dangers of being poisoned. So the fact that a stain remained on a piece of tableware for the royal family, and the fact that it even reached the table, was a clear indication that the maid was insincere in her important duty of checking.But that wasn't all.One day, the princess was running around the garden when she fell down, getting a scratch on her skin. That very same day, her head escort was changed.Whenever she was tired or had a minor illness, the royal doctor's complexion would always turn pale.Once, her shoe broke during a royal banquet. The royal tailor personally came to her room and threw his body on the floor, apologizing with tears running down his face.For Princess Penia, who was born with a graceful personality, all of these were burdensome and only served to put pressure on her.Not a single mistake was allowed on the path of a noble monarch. They must always accept that their own mistakes would be an irreversible disaster for someone else.If the princess herself were to directly express her anger or resentment towards someone, she wouldn't even be able to estimate what kind of disaster she had brought upon them.The Benevolent Princess was a nickname given to her in tribute to her caring nature. But I knew the truth. That her nickname was nothing but a chain that bound her.But there was nothing I could do for her. I didn't have any reason to. But if there was something that was bothering me, it was that I had become a variable in her worries.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to leave. You\u2019ve been looking at that door for some time now. You must have something urgent to attend to, right?\u201dThe princess let me leave as if she had given up. And I was grateful for that.In any case, I knew I shouldn't be here, and yet my existence had given the princess unnecessary stress.\u201cIt's already hard enough to keep up with my classes, but that fox-like merchant keeps hiding her intentions and is trying to devour the whole academy for her own gain! And Professor Glast\u2019s temper isn\u2019t getting any better! Meanwhile, people around me kept mentioning the royal laws\u2026 even if I didn't want to, I had to pay attention to them! It's all too difficult!\u201dThat moment when she lost her rationality and her pent-up feelings surfaced\u2026 She was definitely different from the Princess Penia that I knew.All sorts of incidents would occur in the original story, causing her mind to wear out little by little. But to even include me in there, I was sure she felt as if her head was about to explode.I was worried she may later develop anxiety and affect the story, given how she was already feeling unstable. In which case, I should do whatever I could do\u2026 but there was nothing in particular that I could do.I put my hand on the exit and said a few words.\u201cNo matter what type of burden I may carry, it shouldn't be any heavier than the weight the princess carries.\u201dShe might think I was being too presumptuous, but this shouldn't end up being too big of a deal.\u201cWhile it's definitely necessary to pay attention to politics and social problems, why don't you try putting your mind at ease? This isn\u2019t a place where the royal family needs to establish authority over everything\u2026 it\u2019s just Silvenia Academy.\u201dThe princess's eyes widened at my words, even though I didn\u2019t say anything too surprising.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you are aware of it but you look very tired.\u201dShe lived a life spent looking through others, but she didn\u2019t have much experience in someone else being able to see through her.Looking at the utterly stunned expression on the princess's face, I quickly closed the door and ran out.Thankfully, she didn\u2019t try to stop me. That was a relief.Anyways, Princess Penia was a main character.She may be very bothered by my existence now, but after she gets involved in all sorts of incidents in the main story, she would forget about me soon enough.Let\u2019s not see each other again!Please!* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *I found Taylee McLaure on a wooden bench somewhere in the outskirts of the Student Center. He was sitting down, tightly clutching the wooden sword he used in the duel.Now that I could see Taylee in the distance, that didn't mean I actually had a plan.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dBut wasn't this a hilarious situation? This wasn't even something one would think of.The third-class villain Ed Rothstaylor who verbally abused Taylee McLaure and tried to have him kicked out has now come back to give him some words of encouragement.Wasn't that kind of funny?Because I was so surprised earlier, my body just automatically jumped up and I ended up shouting whatever I could think of at him. But now that I'm thinking calmly, there wasn't anything I could do to encourage Taylee.There was no way he would feel any sense of sincerity no matter what I told him.I thought about what I should do in such an awkward situation as I took each step toward him. But someone blocked my path suddenly.\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer.\u201dI was so surprised, but after looking at her face, I felt a strange sense of joy rising from within me.She had a short wavy dark brown bob, with a weak appearance but a strong expression on her face showing her will.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 don\u2019t come any closer\u2026\u201dDespite both of her arms visibly shaking, she talked while maintaining eye contact.She looked exactly like she did in the game. If you\u2019ve played 'Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster' even once, you would be glad to see her face.She was practically the face of the game. Taylee\u2019s childhood friend who always supported him whenever he was having a hard time or facing a challenge. I didn't expect to see Ayla Triss in the flesh.\u201cEd Rothstaylor\u2026 don\u2019t come\u2026 any closer to Taylee. Don't come closer\u2026!\u201dHer trembling face made her look so pitiful. And yet, there was utter disdain on her face. It was a new sight to see.Of course, only by being in Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s shoes would I get to see Ayla, who had such a weak heart, had such disgust on her face.\u201cEven if it's not you\u2026 for Taylee\u2026 he's already gone through so much! Isn't it enough already?! There's no need to bully him anymore! I also saw you! It\u2026 It must have been hard enough already\u2026!\u201dHer trembling voice was so faint it sounded as though it was going to break, and yet she didn't stop talking till she spat out everything she wanted to say. More than anything, she was truly sincere in wanting to protect Taylee. I felt unnecessarily touched by her efforts.That\u2019s right, this was Ayla\u2026!It\u2019s funny how I felt moved by someone who was staring at me like they wanted to murder me\u2026Clank!The iron cup Ayla was holding fell and started rolling on the stone grounds. She must've been on her way to get some water.It was only then that Taylee responded, having heard the sound of water splashing on the floor.Taylee slowly got up from the bench and started walking toward us.I felt a sense of disharmony then. That sense of weakness he had disappeared as he walked over.\u201cEd\u2026 Rothstaylor\u2026\u201dHe grabbed the sword tightly as he approached me, then he sent Ayla behind his back and he stared at me.\u201cStill\u2026 I guess you still attend school\u2026\u201dA low and serious voice. I was surprised to see that he looked fairly back to life. The Taylee that I saw when he lost the duel surely didn\u2019t look to have a bit of life left in him.So what happened?Taylee\u2019s unique willpower to live. No matter how powerful an opponent, he had a fighting spirit that would never break. I could definitely feel that sense of willpower in him.Had he already resurrected?It seemed so.After coming all the way here, I could see the whole story of what may have happened.I couldn\u2019t follow Taylee right away because of my duel with the Princess.However, his childhood friend and biggest supporter, Ayla Triss, worriedly ran after him.And what happened next could be inferred without having to see it in person.No matter how high a wall or how difficult an ordeal may be, for anything that blocked Taylee\u2019s path, Ayla would always hug, encourage, and give him positive reinforcement.\"It's okay. You can overcome it this time too. You've done so well thus far. I believe in you. You can do it. Don't be discouraged, Taylee.\"She was always there to give Tayle heartwarming support, crying and laughing by his side.As long as Ayla was with him, Taylee would always stand back up after getting knocked down.I think even Taylee knew about it.\u201cComing here... For what reason... What business do you have with me...?\u201dBecause of her, Taylee was able to stand again.I was worried he might think I was bullying Ayla, which would explain why he hid her small body behind him as he looked straight at me with such burning volition.I was already used to this overwhelming feeling.Having played as Taylee countless times, it was because of this strong willpower that I felt fully immersed in the game.\u201cYou were quite good with the sword. I saw how you handled it.\u201d\u201cTell me clearly what you are planning.\u201d\u201cI don't have anything planned.\u201dFor someone who used to despise you at the entrance exam to suddenly say such things, it couldn't be helped that he thought I was out of my mind.But I still wanted to tell him something, at the very least.I gained a sense of affection for him, having played 'Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster' many times in the past.While I played the game, there were many times I felt he truly had a strong mental fortitude. No matter how difficult the challenges he faced were, I was always greatly encouraged by that strong willpower and never felt discouraged.Coming to the hasty conclusion that he would lose the will to fight just because he got beaten by Lucy once\u2026I guess I worried too much.He was supposed to be my solution, the one who would take on all the ordeals that would happen in the future. He was supposed to be that kind of a pushover. But after meeting him in person, my heart seemed to have changed a bit to some extent.Well, it was already a given that he would have to take care of all the hardships for me but I should set that aside for now. I would seem heartless if I didn't.\u201cEuut!\u201dMy eyes met with Ayla, her gaze still filled with contempt. But all I did was nod at her and then turned around.I was on pins and needles, worried that Taylee had collapsed.But no matter how praiseworthy or amazing of a friend they may be, having more contact may negatively impact the future.So I just turned around and walked away.I could feel their gazes on my back. And without looking, I knew their faces must be saying, \u201cJust what the hell is wrong with that guy?\u201d\u2026well, it was something that couldn't be helped.* * *Shortly after, while the Joint Combat Training was still underway, sparks started to soar through the sky.The students playing around the Student Center were all surprised as they looked at Nail Hall. Nobody thought that such a large-scale fire would break out so suddenly.Although it wasn't a fire in the first place.The flame of Takan, a high-ranking fire spirit, was a cursed flame that burned only the opponent targeted by the Elementalist who summoned him.But that didn\u2019t mean it wasn't hot. The heat could definitely be felt spreading through the grounds. With this high temperature from a distance, the students in the audience probably felt like they were thrown into the desert.\u201cWas it already time for that?\u201dI went back towards Nail Hall with my hands in my pocket.This was the climax scene of the Joint Combat Practice event for the first and second years.If this was the original story, we would all be sitting in the audience at Nail Hall, watching it together.But Lucy won over Taylee, which was different from what was supposed to happen. But thanks to the scale of the fire, I could tell from where I was.This was the duel between 'The Golden Daughter Lortel' and 'Yennekar Palerover.'To gauge the skills of the second-year\u2019s star student, Lortel cast intermediate ice magic at risk of getting herself disqualified. The spell blew off the ceiling of Nail Hall.After all, the cost of repairing the ceiling was nothing to her.But because of that, Yennekar was forced to show off the full extent of her skills and brought out the manifestation of Takan, the strongest amongst all the spirits she had signed a contract with.I could picture what was happening even though I wasn\u2019t there.The firefly lizard wrapped around the large Nail Hall had the most overwhelming and grandest appearance among Yennekar\u2019s \u2018best friends\u2019.I caught a glimpse of her sitting on its flaming head. She grabbed onto the spirit's hard scales and swung her wand around, just in case she lost balance and fell off. It was quite a sight to see her smiling so cheerfully in such a situation.Never forgetting to smile, she truly was like the main character in a fairy tale.I sat on a bench nearby and leaned back. I was exhausted. I didn\u2019t really want to enter the Nail Hall, currently burning with heat.The appearance of the giant flaming lizard roaring against the backdrop of the setting sun was certainly quite surreal.Even though some things happened differently from the original, I was sure Taylee and Ayla were watching this same scene.This was going to be the final boss of Act 1, and also the first out of countless ordeals that Taylee would have to face.The top student of the second-year magic students at Silvenia Academy, Yennekar Palerover.I hoped they were watching it clearly.Because this would be the last chance they get to see her appearance like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: The Golden Daughter (1)\u201cHey hey!\u201dI was able to control the corners of my mouth from turning upside down through sheer superhuman restraint.Because I came back to an uninvited guest at my camp after gathering some edible plants and herbs.The guest was none other than the second-year top student, the so-called genius Elementalist, Yennekar. She was sitting on my log by the fire, waving her feet around in greeting.We met by chance at the Guardian Tree of Merilda before, and she would often greet me because we had overlapping classes. Though I never properly returned any of her greetings.It's because I was trying to avoid Yennekar. Besides, her best friends would always appear like ghosts to take her away from me.I was actually thankful for that since I wanted to minimize my contact with her. But to Yennekar who wanted to become friends with everyone, I must have been a big obstacle.I was sure her friends had already reminded her multiple times that nothing good would come out of befriending a jerk like Ed Rothstaylor. Unfortunately for them, Yennekar had the attitude of a toddler.She always had a bubbly appearance, and even when she seemed to just be sitting still and not thinking, she would ultimately still go ahead and do whatever she thought was right.This very situation was conclusive proof.\u201cWow, this is amazing! It's totally like a secret base here!\u201dShe raised her hand and excitedly walked around in admiration, like an innocent child watching the first snow.\u201cCan I keep coming over to play?\u201d\u2018No you can\u2019t,\u2019\u00a0was what I wanted to say but I was afraid she would get hurt if I said it so straightforwardly. Ah, this bright and energetic girl had some type of talent that made people want to protect her. That must be why our classmates cared so much about her.\u201cWell, if you find anything good about this place, then you can come.\u201d\u201cMy heart is pounding because this place feels like such an adventure. Ed, don\u2019t you think so too?\u201dOf course, my heart was pounding every day. A few days ago, I made a mistake when managing the campfire and the flame went out at dawn so I almost got attacked by a wild boar.So even though both of our hearts were pounding, there was definitely a difference between the two.\u201cI want to talk to you more\u2026 There are things I want to ask you\u2026 And there\u2019s something I also need your advice on.\u201d\u2018Out of all the many people out there, why does it have to be me?\u2019 But that would have been too cruel of a question to throw right at her face.No matter how necessary it was to keep my distance, treating others too rudely would just make my personality complete trash.But on the other hand, it was also true that there was nothing good about being too friendly.\u201cHow did you know how to find this place?\u201dMy camp was located in a corner of the wide northern forest, far away from both the academic and business districts.There were only a few people who knew that I lived out here.\u201cBy any chance, did that Wolf tell you?\u201dThe most likely answer had to be Merilda.The high-ranking wind spirit Merilda was like family to Yennekar. And this was her forest too, so it would make sense if she had told Yennekar about me surviving in a corner of her forest.\u201cNo, Merilda talks about you a lot but\u2026 but she never told me about the location of your camp or any of your personal secrets. Because that was your personal business.\u201dWow, that bastard. She was surprisingly protective of others\u2019 privacy, wasn't she? I thought she would have told Yennekar everything about me already since she was such a chatterbox.Then who the hell told Yennekar the location of my camp?\u201cAnd the answer is\u2026\u201dYennekar made a drumroll sound as if to announce who.Twisting my own hair around, I didn\u2019t give my answer right away. Though I had already figured out who through the process of elimination.\u201cSo it was Bell\u2026\u201d\u201cWow! Y-You\u2019re quite quick-witted!\u201dBell Maya. That name, which I was somewhat unfamiliar with, referred to a senior maid at Ophelis Hall, famous for being the most luxurious of the three Silvenia Academy dormitories.How was she able to tell Yennekar about the location of this camp?Well, to talk about that, we'd have to go back to about a week ago.* * *[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 6Intelligence: 5Dexterity: 9Willpower: 8Luck: 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226bIt was my long-awaited weekend, a time when I could finally take care of the things I had delayed the whole school week.First, I washed my sweat-soaked clothes from hunting all morning and hung them out to dry on a stone by the stream.It had already been two weeks since that troublesome Joint Combat Practice class.Getting tied up with the main characters of the story had aged me by about ten years. I also felt twice as tired, feeling like I was walking on a tightrope, always anxious about adversely affecting the main story while living my daily life.Though thankfully, after combat practice, there hadn't been any time when I got involved with the main characters. It had been a comfortable time for me.Being able to solely focus on my studies and survival, my stamina rose by an additional point. Although my relatively high Dexterity stat slowly began to decrease in gaining experience for another point. From level 10 onwards, raising its level by even a point won't be easy.My Vitality stat was really not that bad. Of course, it would look pathetic to Combat Department students who had overwhelming combat specs, but it was already at a level that could serve me well as an ordinary person.After all, the reference point for a high-performance stat was 10. Whether it be one's proficiency level or basic stat, the gains would become extremely low once level 10 is hit. From then on, bone-crushing efforts would be needed to raise them by even a little.And considering how the end specs were around 20, there was still a long way to go.But that was for extraordinary playable characters that went beyond the standards of an ordinary person. My current stats were already enough to live my life.Besides, thanks to my efforts, my body had already gained some muscles.Having taken my top off, I looked at my body's reflection on the water.\u201cAs I thought, the Vitality stat has a real impact.\u201dI had continuously been on a tight schedule for the past two months, pushing my human limitations. In order to keep up, my body started to adapt.Even if I couldn't become a macho man with thick wild muscles, at least my body had started to form muscles on my stomach, shoulders, and my forearms. This was a great achievement as Ed's original body was as skinny as an anchovy.Since this body had no physical talent to begin with, I thought it was fair to say I had made quite a bit of progress.However, my proficiency level for both my bow and my dagger was very low. My dagger was one of my most useful weapons but it hadn't even accumulated any proficiency. I had been going at this for quite a long time now but I still had a very long way to go.\u201cI should be training now so I can afford to be more comfortable later on\u2026 This isn't the time to be unnecessarily lazy.\u201dI had some pretty significant results, but I shouldn't be satisfied with them alone. I began to stretch my limbs, then bent my back and twisted my torso. I needed to start moving to take care of the work I hadn't been able to do all week.I was planning to make more firewood and cut some logs again. Then I plan to weave a net with my remaining time in the afternoon. I would gather all my remaining silk threads and layer them diagonally, then twist them into each section to make a complex net.But why was I making a net? While it would be for fishing, I planned to use it more importantly with fish preservation.I usually stored my meat in underground storage, but since I hadn't been preserving them for much longer, they also spoil quickly. Salting them all together had also become a problem since the salt I could harvest from my rock salt was never enough.The method I thought of was to smoke it. I could smoke the surface with wood which would slightly cook it. Then I could dry it out. Doing these would extend the shelf life of my fish by a few days, and would allow me to invest more time in my studies and other activities around the camp.But the smoked fish was still not as efficient as meat when it came to shelf life. Also, it tended to alter the taste which made it hard to cook.This was why I thought of making a net. I would hang it on a branch by the stream and serve as a fish farm. If this were to work out well, then I can even store my fish alive. I can have both the freshness and the real taste of the fish.It should be a worthwhile attempt. I never had the energy to do it during the school week because of my classes and having to collect resources to live day by day. But having free time during weekends allowed me to experiment.I decided to quickly get on with making more firewood, then check on my school uniform which should be dry by then, and then I could start working on my net.\u201cZzz\u2026 Zzz\u2026\u201dI started stretching my body some more, warming up with my top off. But as I arrived at my workbench, I found Lucy Mayreel curled up on the tree's base, sleeping.I naturally picked her up and carried her on my shoulder like a sack of potatoes, then threw her inside the wooden shelter.\u201cOoo, aghk!\u201dLucy tossed and turned on top of the soft marten and squirrel leather-covered bed. She then quietly breathed through her lips and fell sound asleep.It was Lucy\u2019s naptime. Right when I was just about to forget about her, she would come into my camp and use my bed. I don't even sigh anymore when I see her.\u201cI\u2019ll go cut 50 pieces of firewood and then check on my school uniform. I should be done in an hour.\u201dI spat on both my hands and grabbed my ax, then swung it down my first firewood of the day.Clank!\u201cWaaahk\u2026\u201dI heard a loud crash behind me so I turned around and saw Lucy gently stroking her forehead as if she had jumped up and hit her head on the wooden support stick.Lucy never woke up unless you pinch both her cheeks. But now she had suddenly jumped up on her own.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026something stinks!\u201dShe then grabbed her witch hat and ran out of my camp like the wind.I couldn\u2019t help but admire her lightning-like movements. In the blink of an eye, she had gone and disappeared. All that was left was the aftermath of the wind magic she used to blow off my sweat.\u201cWhat\u2019s with her?\u201dBut it didn't take long for me to realize her reason.\u201cWho's over there?\u201dOut from the grass came Bell Maya, a senior maid at Ophelis Hall, Silvenia\u2019s most prestigious dormitory.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *I knew the detailed setup for the maids of Ophelis Hall.Ophelis Hall was where all sorts of nobles and talented students lived. And as the people who managed this dormitory, the Ophelis Hall maids all worked with the same skill and pride like that of a royal maid. They were usually specialists in their field and had received special education for it since childhood.But that was just part of their setup. I couldn't remember anything memorable about them having a huge influence on the game's story.They were just meant to emphasize just how special Ophelis Hall was, but there was none among them who had a significant impact on the main story.In other words, the Bell Maya I had just encountered had no recognition. If you were to look at her level of importance in the story, she was just a side character comparable to Ed Rothstaylor, a villain who was written for a few scenes and then thrown away.\u201cI was thinking about walking deep into the forest for the first time in a while, but I didn\u2019t know I would be meeting the young master Ed here.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak formally to me.\u201dBell Maya was a very minor character in the story, but she would show up every so often and deliver a meaningful line.As an example, when the protagonist or heroine was faced with a challenge, she would say, \u2018But the will in his eyes is still alive. I\u2019m sure he will definitely win\u2019 or \u2018If it\u2019s her\u2026 She can surely overcome it,\u2019 and other such lines. She was someone who gave some meaningful foreshadowing.She never actually did anything to solve the problem, but she would give the player the confidence that the problem would be solved. She was a necessary character that actually seemed kind of unnecessary.Other than that, she was the only person Lucy Mayreel, a magician who only did whatever she wanted, was scared of.Whoever she was wouldn't really change no matter how much meaning was put into it.She was just a member of the \u2018Side Character Club\u2019 like Ed Rothstaylor.\u201cI\u2019ll just speak formally.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more uncomfortable with you speaking so formally.\u201d\u201cEither way, I am no longer a noble.\u201d\u201cBut you are still a student at Silvenia.\u201dHer neat black short hair and modest behavior explained how she became a Senior Maid at Ophelis Hall, a place full of professionals.Even though she had come this deep into the forest, her elegant maid uniform didn\u2019t have a single wrinkle, despite her being unable to use beginner's magic.\u201cIf I\u2019m speaking honestly, I am quite surprised.\u201dShe didn't look the tiniest bit sincere despite saying such words.\u201cYour tone of voice has changed quite a bit, and you now have such a strong physique.\u201dOnly then did I realize that I was half-naked. I rarely get embarrassed but seeing her unchanged poised expression was rather embarrassing.\u201cI think it\u2019s quite a wonderful change. I am happy.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can speak casually.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn't tell because of her expressionless face but I may have poked at her strange pride just then.\u201cYou have to.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhen you lived in Ophelis Hall, you did so.\u201d\u201cThat was then. When I used to live in Ophelis Hall.\u201dAll of the Ophelis Hall maids had a strange stubbornness that was hard to understand.I saw that Bell was holding a big basket in one hand. Glancing at its contents, it seemed like it was filled with all kinds of mushrooms, wild vegetables, and fruits.Meals at Ophelis Hall mostly used high-quality ingredients delivered from various stores. But when fresh ingredients were essential, there would be times that the maids would obtain them locally.Seeing her do this made me understand that internet meme about calling Ophelis Hall maids, \u2018Human Livestock Manufacturers.\u2019TN: Author actually says internet memeThe students didn\u2019t have to do anything, all they needed to do was sit still and open their mouths.\u201cI knew that you still attended the academy. I help the young lady Yennekar with her morning preparations and she always talks about you, young master Ed.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cBut I had no idea that you are living like this. When you left Ophelis Hall, your face looked like it was the end of the world. I thought you would end up leaving the academy.\u201dHow strange for maids like her to feel uncomfortable when someone talked to them with respect. Just what kind of education did they receive to have this kind of mindset?But what caught my eyes was the basket she was holding.It was full of all sorts of mushrooms, wild vegetables, and fruits.I felt limited by the knowledge I was getting from books when it came to edible plant life. Since the contents of that basket should all be edible, if I could just get one, then the types of plants I could collect would increase dramatically.I never touched mushrooms and fruits, in particular, because there were quite toxic ingredients if not handled properly. I couldn\u2019t help but drool at the opportunity to open my door to more options.Bell Maya may appear quite cold, but she was actually quite nice. She would willingly accept if I were to ask for help.Just as I mentioned, she was just a side character that had not much influence on the story. Nothing big would change or happen should we interact or become closer to each other.In fact, there may be more benefits than harm. If we become a bit closer, then wouldn\u2019t I be able to ask for ingredients, fabrics, and other various work tools left around Ophelis Hall?At this point, wouldn\u2019t it be more stupid if I were to push her coldly away?The faces of the Ophelis Hall maids were rarely even shown throughout the entire game. That\u2019s right! It shouldn\u2019t matter if we become close to each other!After I came to that conclusion, I adjusted my voice and spoke to Bell Maya in a welcoming tone, with a comfortable smile.\u201cComing all the way deep into the forest to procure such ingredients, you have been through so much. But as for that basket\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s right, it should be fine if we become friends!And that was a choice I would regret making until the end of the story.* * *\u201cYeah, yeah. I talk to Bell so much about you, Ed. That's why when Bell and I were talking, she suddenly told me about how she met you here.\u201dWas Bell really going around revealing my private information like that? Something that even a high-ranking wind spirit was protecting?No, I was sure the Bell Maya I knew was quiet and wouldn\u2019t talk about others so carelessly. After all, being tight-lipped was one of the most basic qualities of an experienced maid.And as far as I knew, Bell Maya was an elite maid equipped with such a basic skill.\u201cSince it\u2019s the weekend, she told me to come and visit you. Look, she even tied my hair up so prettily today? Look here, isn\u2019t it pretty when it\u2019s braided to one side like this?\u201dOh, would you look at this kid?!\u201cAh, is that so...\u201d\u201cSo, about this concern I talked about earlier\u2026\u201dYennekar sat down and held her knees, slowly getting to her point.At first, I wondered why she went to me amongst so many other people.While looking at the burning campfire, Yennekar finally managed to say it.\u201cEd, you might not have seen it since you left first. But during the Joint Combat Practice last month, I ended up hurting some people.\u201dIt was the event in which she summoned Takan, a high-ranking fire spirit, and covered the entire Nail Hall in flames. It was one of the largest-scaled events that would take place this semester.It was obvious who she ended up hurting. Although it was just a natural reaction, considering the first year Lortel broke the rules first and used intermediate magic, that was only a secondary fact for Yennekar who had a good heart.But why was I the one counseling her?In the first place, all of the students were on Yennekar\u2019s side.Yennekar was bubbly and lovely, and to the second-years, she was a precious treasure. Whenever she felt guilty or would blame herself, everyone would rush and come forward to encourage and side with her.However, Yennekar knew that all of their evaluations and opinions were one-sided.They weren\u2019t able to make objective and fair judgments because they cared about Yennekar. While she may be thankful that they were always on her side unconditionally, that didn\u2019t mean any of the mistakes she had made would disappear.That was why she came to me. She knew I was less inclined to take her side. I wouldn\u2019t be judging the event simply from her perspective.She was very kind and upright, that\u2019s why her relationship with Lortel was this bad.\u201cYou know, even when I try to forget it all, \u2018As I thought, I went too far\u2026\u2019 and \u2018Did I overreact so much that I ended up hurting her that much?\u2019 I can\u2019t get rid of these thoughts.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cShould I go and apologize?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d\u201cBut my friends always stop me from apologizing because she did something wrong in the first place.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t do it. As long as you think it's right.\u201d\u201cHmmm~\u201dYennekar sat still, her chin resting on top of her knees.I decided not to force my opinions on her. This was a situation where I couldn\u2019t be sure how it would affect her. Yennekar was too important for me to influence her behavior by making a right or wrong judgment.But I couldn\u2019t help but want to promise her everything would be alright.\u201cAs expected of Ed.\u201dHowever, her response was more surprising than I thought.\u201cEd\u2026 you never unconditionally take my side.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it if it makes you sad.\u201d\u201cHuh? No, no. Don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201dYennekar smiled as she enjoyed the burning campfire. Somehow, the tension in the air seemed a little less than usual.\u201cI don\u2019t feel bad at all. Not one bit. In fact, I feel relieved.\u201dSimple meaningful words kept on coming out.\u201cI wish that everyone in the world was more like you, Ed.\u201dI didn\u2019t have the time to think about what those words meant. Because I had a pile of work I had to finish today.* * *\u201cI would like to purchase 2 hours of your time, Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dIt happened two days later. The moment I came out of my Elemental Studies class to eat lunch.She looked elegant and quite polite at first glance, but her bright turquoise eyes were filled with greed for money.Her reddish-brown hair was neatly combed and was tied up to her shoulder blades, running down her shoulders.There was a small bandage from the bottom of her neck to her forearm, a result of her injury during the Joint Combat Practice class. It had been a long time since then, it made me realize just how serious her injuries must have been if she still had some wounds left. That nice girl Yennekar must have completely stomped on her.She was waiting for me in the academic district, sitting on a bench with a rather dignified posture. I knew who she was.She was someone who would become at odds with Princess Penia, acting like cats and dogs. She was one of the four heroines of \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019.The only daughter of Elte Kehelland, the greatest merchant on the continent. A rare businesswoman who climbed to the top of the tower of gold coins with only her desire for wealth.In the future, people would pay respect to her by calling her \u2018The Golden Daughter.\u2019____To all the readers, we would like to apologize for the delayed release of this chapter and would also like to apologize for the continued delay of upcoming chapters until the corresponding issues are resolved. We thank you for your continued patience and understanding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: The Golden Daughter (2)Lortel was someone who understood human greed better than anyone else.She wasn\u2019t someone who would have an active role until Act 2, well after Yennekar had left, but her face would pop up here and there in Act 1 as well.Her roles before and after Act 1 were clearly different. Although she was already quite infamous even in Act 1.\u2018Bad Ending Maker\u2019 \u2018Newbie Grinder\u2019 \u2018The Developer\u2019s Curse\u2019These were what players used to call her. Other than these nicknames, people also used to say such hurtful words against Lortel in Act 1.I couldn\u2019t remember much of my newbie days from long ago, but just remembering how many times Lortel used to ruin me in Act 1 still made me shudder.Getting involved with Lortel in Act 1 always guaranteed a bad ending.During Taylee\u2019s Class Assignment Examination event, you could choose to rescue Lortel from a Kobold raid, but rescuing her would result in Taylee witnessing Lortel\u2019s \u2018secret.\u2019 Later on, Lortel would have Taylee kidnapped and taken out of the academy until he was declared missing. That was Bad Ending Number 2.In the monster subjugation episode, there was an opportunity to be in the same group as Lortel. But if you chose to join the same group as her rather than join your friend Ayla\u2019s group, Ayla would fall off a cliff and die. Why? Because Ayla stumbling off a cliff would trigger an event where Taylee would be able to quickly catch her. But of course, if you joined Lortel\u2019s group, Taylee wouldn\u2019t be able to save Ayla, resulting in her death. That was Bad Ending Number 7.During the Joint Combat Practice event, there was an option to protect Lortel from the high-ranking fire spirit Takan summoned by Yennekar, but in doing so, Taylee would get burned and seriously injured. That was Bad Ending Number 13.Then during the subjugation of Glasskan, there was an event to reclaim the Student Center by breaking into Nail Hall using the way proposed by Lortel. But if you were to follow her advice, Taylee would be ambushed and killed by a bunch of spirits that were waiting on that path. That was Bad Ending Number 22.Swearing at the developers for creating such a character couldn\u2019t be helped, but if you were to play \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 all the way to the end, you would start to understand the developer\u2019s intentions and even begin to admire it. The intention wasn\u2019t that complicated either.Lortel Kehelland\u2019s role was as the \u2018hidden heroine.\u2019A character who was the complete opposite of the righteous and benevolent Princess Penia. Lortel had only been treated as a character to control and take over, but her true character would be revealed in the second half of the story.The twist in her story and the unexpected gap between her two sides made the players recognize her strong charms as a character. Only talking and understanding calculations, Lortel grew up with no choice but to gradually view the world calculatingly.She led a life of picking up and eating bread thrown away at the slums, she developed beliefs that were built on fraud and deceit, she harbored a loneliness that had swallowed a part of her heart, yet no matter how much money she accumulated, it never disappeared.While the player\u2019s opinion of Lortel would slowly improve little by little, and they finally began to understand the loneliness engraved in her life, it was at that precise moment that a question would be asked:Would you be on the side of the \u2018Student Council\u2019 ], led by The Benevolent Princess, or on the side of the \u2018Top Class\u2019, led by The Golden Daughter Lortel?Would you support the upright beliefs and idealism shown by the noble Princess Penia, or would you support Lortel\u2019s realism, who had been fighting loneliness in the wild-like reality?\u201cExcuse me? Ed?\u201dTo summarize, the system that had constantly been driving players into bad endings in Act 1 was intentional.The players began to consciously avoid Lortel due to them falling trapped in her bad endings. This formed a psychological gap between the players and Lortel.The larger the gap, the more dramatic the twist reveal would be to the player in the future.I was talking about the true harmony between the system and the story.\u201cEd Rothstaylor? Hello? Can you hear me?\u201dIt was quite amazing when I looked back on it.I nodded my head in satisfaction as I walked.Well, there\u2019s that.And then there was this.\u201cHow long are you going to keep following me?\u201d\u201cI had no idea you would be this stubborn in ignoring me.\u201dNo, I need to be stubborn and ignore her.Wasn\u2019t it obvious?It was always better to set the mood first in whatever you did. That\u2019s what this was.Seeing her in front of my Elemental Studies class in the academic district, she immediately threw out a meaningful line. Not bad.\u201cI would like to purchase 2 hours of your time, Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dThat was certainly a great start.This student was The Golden Daughter Lortel.Someone such as her coming out of nowhere to make me an offer was certainly something that made me curious.Normally, I should\u2019ve started asking her questions.What did you mean you wanted to buy two hours of my time? What were you planning on making me do? If you wanted to buy it, then did that mean you would give me money? How much money would you give me? Would you give it to me right now? What was your true intention?If I asked such questions, Lortel would continue the conversation with a grin on her face. That was probably what Lortel thought was going to happen.Naturally, she would steer the conversation to form around the questions I asked, controlling and avoiding certain questions while taking the lead in the situation.Considering Lortel\u2019s specialty was her silver tongue*, she had the ability to negotiate and talk until you found yourself falling into her proposal before you could even come to your senses.TN: Negative expression about being a good speaker able to trick others.But that would be if I didn\u2019t know what her intentions were.\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve heard parts of the story already?As I knew, I shattered all her expected developments and strode along, ignoring her. And yet she kept on following me. The difference in our strides was quite wide. She had to follow me at a quicker pace, but this didn\u2019t slow her down.\u201cI heard you are having a hard time after being disowned. Perhaps I could be of some help?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say things you don't mean.\u201d\u201cOh my, speaking politely is more important than you might think. It means you respect the other person.\u201dShe didn\u2019t care at all about my ride manners due to her nature.Lortel ran in front of me and adorably held her hands behind her back with a cute smile on her face.Don\u2019t you want to hear me out? It\u2019s not a bad suggestion!She had that look on her face.\u201cI felt touched after seeing you\u2026\u201dShe then spat out her story in her sly way.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t heard the rumors that you were a little small tiny bit arrogant and egotistical, but that\u2019s fine! It\u2019s honestly not that important. Hahaha!\u201dEveryone already knew how awful Ed Rothstaylor was but she said it so fast like rapid gunfire.\u201cIt\u2019s only human nature to want to give out a helping hand after watching you continue to learn here despite it being such a difficult environment. After all, there was a time when I was also poor and hungry.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cA deposit of three plain gold coins.\u201dIt was as much money as the maids at Collen Hall, one of the other dormitories where ordinary students lived, would make for a full month\u2019s work.I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about next semester\u2019s tuition payment if I had 20 gold coins.\u201cI want to become friends with Yennekar.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dI started laughing even without her explanation. I knew it. The difference in values between Penia and Lortel was a key conflict throughout the story.Ultimately, it was going to become important who Taylee would decide to side with. It was still uncertain at this point, so I shouldn\u2019t be too hasty and take either side just yet.\u201cCan\u2019t you introduce me, please? All you have to do is come with us, and the three of us can all talk together. I don\u2019t think it will even take the full two hours.\u201d\u201cSince becoming The Daughter of Gold, do you buy personal connections with money?\u201d\u201cWell, I won\u2019t be coy about it then.\u201dLortel took three gold coins from her sleeve and put them in my pocket.\u201cHere, keep this for now. I know it well. The more people on my side, the better.\u201dLortel seemed to have realized this intuitively. After all, she had been living her whole life walking on a tightrope, people watching her from below.She would eventually get into a political battle with Princess Penia soon. It was best to make as many allies as she could from now on. The rift between the two wasn\u2019t something that could be closed by being considerate and giving in a little bit.As I stood still, staring at her, Lortel began to smile that cunning smile of hers again.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me as if I'm a pathetic person. Usually, by now, people would be trying to hide their faces, thinking, \u2018Wow, what a jackpot!\u2019\u201dI spoke with a big grin on my face.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s shake on it once.\u201d* * ** * *Nobody knew the true nature of greed as well as Lortel did. At least, that was what she thought.Mad and immature greed was like a disease that had reached the incubation period. It was quite easy to control when the situation was calm, but the moment you were pushed into a corner and urgently needed a bit of money, then that greed could take over an entire person\u2019s being.Those who didn\u2019t have food for tomorrow soon became those who no longer have a place to rest. And just a bit of money would make their eyes look bloodshot. As a native of the slums, Lortel knew that feeling very well.Not only that, but the bigger the difference in wealth there was, the more the power of greed would consume a human\u2019s heart, making it uncontrollably strong.Those who had once lived a lofty lifestyle would collapse the moment they faced poverty. She had seen too many debtors take their own lives because they couldn\u2019t accept the difference between when they had money and now that they were broke.The amount of gold it took for them to break down wasn\u2019t at the scale of a house or a property either. Ultimately, it came down to one small coin.No, it wasn\u2019t the amount of money that was important. Because even if you were to offer the same amount, someone would always be willing to sell more.Selling one\u2019s pride for just one gold coin.Selling one\u2019s family for just one gold coin.Even selling one\u2019s self for just one gold coin.The market price of a gold coin wouldn\u2019t change and was set, but those who were cornered without a choice would always bring more and more things to sell.Because there was no other option.Because it was the only path they could see.That was why the \u2018first time\u2019 was really important.Holding that gold coin in their hand after the first time, thinking it was fine because it was just once, it would then become the beginning of a disaster that would drive a cornered person off a cliff. The first time was the starting point of all subsequent schemes and tactics.It was so easy and simple to take advantage of someone who was desperate.It was quite sad.\u201c......\u201dWhen Lortel finally came to her senses, Ed Rothstaylor had already left. Was it because she was flustered for a second?\u201cWell, that was quite interesting.\u201dLooking at Ed\u2019s back as he left, Lortel let out a giggle.When he shook her small hand, the three gold coins she had shoved in his pocket had found their way back into her hands.He had an attitude that didn\u2019t even let them become a bit closer.It was as if\u2026 he had understood all of Lortet\u2019s intentions from the very beginning.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: The Golden Daughter (3)Lortel was an extreme realist who was also very good at compromising.It was Lortel\u2019s fate to become one. She had big ambitions but lacked natural ability.Hearing that from someone else would probably make one wonder what it meant.This was because as soon as Lortel was admitted into the academy, she was one of the only three students who qualified for Class A by Professor Glast. She had a photographic memory, so much so that reading something only once was enough for her to memorize the core concepts of a book. Her mana resonance was also high, so high that ordinary students couldn\u2019t follow. And she even came from a rich background, coming from the Elte Company.However, no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t reach the very top.There was \u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019 in the Magic Department, who was treated as some sort of celestial being.Lortel\u2019s combat senses such as her agility, improvisation, and judgment were no match for \u2018The Spear from Nature Ziggs.\u2019Her family\u2019s background and her noble status, coupled with her innate personality and her ability as a leader, all of these were useless when compared to her nemesis, Princess Penia.Fate mischievously only allowed her to live a second-rate life.And the means that Lortel used to break through Fate\u2019s curse was \u2018pure desire\u2019.\u201cOh my, it\u2019s Yennekar.\u201dUnderstanding profits and losses, income and expenditure, doing calculations. It was Lortel\u2019s perseverance that made both arms of the scale lean towards her, even for a little bit.She had a compromising attitude that was willing to join hands with an awful and merciless realism or a necessary evil without any hesitation.Living her life like this stigmatized Lortel as an opportunist, but she didn\u2019t find that particularly insulting. Rather, she thought it far more disgraceful to not seize the string of opportunities that came her way.\u201cI was going to visit you with a present, but I ended up meeting you here.\u201d\u201cHm? Oh, you\u2019re\u2026 Lortel. You look really different with your hair down.\u201d\u201cI hear that often.\u201dThey met at a corridor in Ophelis Hall, the dormitory that boasted the most luxurious facilities among the three dormitories in Silvenia.For a student to be allowed to stay at Ophelis, one of the two conditions had to be met: overwhelming status or overwhelming grades.Yennekar satisfied the latter while Lortel satisfied both as the successor of the Elte Company. But this didn\u2019t mean their living conditions were significantly any different.Lortel was heading back to her room after taking an evening bath, attended by an Ophelis Hall maid. Due to this, her outfit was rather simple, and her hair, which was yet to dry, was untied. To Yennekar, her impression looked quite new.\u201cI caused a big commotion awhile back after I arbitrarily used intermediate magic during the Joint Combat Practice class. Truth was, part of me was particularly impulsive. It\u2019s been a while since the incident, but I still wanted to apologize.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dThe reason Lortel attached Yennekar with the intermediate ice magic \u2018Ice Spear\u2019 and \u2018Flash Freeze\u2019 was to gauge her skills as the top student of the second-years.There was no denying it, the leading force in Silvenia\u2019s Magic Department was the first years. But despite this, they couldn\u2019t be guaranteed a victory in a duel when their opponents were of a higher grade than they were.Nevertheless, Yennekar\u2019s title as being the best student among the second-years wasn\u2019t in vain.Among the first years, Lucy Mayreel was the undisputed 1st place so it didn\u2019t make sense to discuss who the top student was. But at least Lortel\u2019s name wasn\u2019t left out when discussing who was 2nd.But she wondered what the gap was between her and Yennekar. Unfortunately, Lortel\u2019s attempt to gauge it had not much meaning. Because even her intermediate elemental magic, which even third years couldn\u2019t handle, didn\u2019t cause any significant damage to Yennekar who summoned a high-ranking fire spirit.Arrogance was expensive. Even though it had been a while since the class ended, Lortel still needed to wear bandages inside her clothes due to minor wounds that hadn\u2019t healed yet.\u201cYour wounds haven\u2019t completely healed yet.\u201dLortel sharply caught on to the fact that Yennekar still felt a bit of guilt about her wounds.Yennekar Palerover was too nice. It was because of her good nature that the people around her felt a strong protective instinct towards her, making her an idol among the second years.Moreover, the second years had been feeling miserable from being overshadowed by the first years. As Yennekar was the only one who showcased her competency against them, she became a savior to second years as well. In a way, this was all due to Lortel, who she beat horribly in the Joint Combat Training class.She was just the adorable and cute top second-year student who was also an Elementalist, but now, she had become the only light and hope for the second years.Those eyes filled with anticipation, following her, had made her an object of envy.\u201cIt should heal soon. You don\u2019t have to worry about it too much.\u201dLortel believed that personal connections led to social power. Since Lortel had lived her life realizing this fact, she didn\u2019t put on a smile for the cute second year.Having someone indebted to you could be considered an asset. And it would be foolish of Lortel to not use the assets she had.With this in mind, Lortel thought of starting an exchange with Yennekar through her debt as an opportunity.\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t get along with Ed?\u201dOnce in a while, Yennekar\u2019s smile could truly take your breath away.In business, such a sly smile could be seen as being double-faced. This was because merchants were the type of people to take advantage of those with a kind and pure smile.But strangely enough, Lortel didn\u2019t feel any sense of malice in Yennekar\u2019s smile.Lortel was also pretty sharp by nature. Yennekar\u2019s question was a pure question. It was without any malice or hidden intention.\u201cI hear everything around the northern part of the forest. Spirits tend to be quite the chatterboxes.\u201dYennekar must have chased after Ed after he ignored Lortel\u2019s words. But wasn\u2019t the route he took leading towards the entrance of the northern forest?Originally, the northern forest was Yennekar\u2019s territory. That was because most of the spirits playing in the northern forest were on Yennekar\u2019s side.But Lortel could only see far enough into the edge of the entrance to the forest. And to say that Ed Rothstaylor was in Yennekar\u2019s territory was just ridiculous because the conversation Lortel had with him was not something she could just proudly reveal, even as empty words.Lortel thought of using money to buy Yennekar as a personal connection. And then use her as an opportunity to gauge Ed Rothstaylor who was currently stuck in a tight spot. He really wasn\u2019t in a situation to be acting this stubborn.\u201cYou probably have your own way of doing things but\u2026\u201dGiven the amount of respect Yennekar received, she was certainly worthy enough of being called a saint.\u201cEd must have his own way of doing things too. And from my point of view, I am more moved by his efforts.\u201d\u201c......\u201d\u201cOf course, your willingness to use gold coins as a means to become closer with me also made me feel really emotional, but sincerity isn\u2019t something that money could buy. Am I being too condescending? It\u2019s my first time having someone younger than me so I think I may be acting like I\u2019m too full of myself\u2026 Ah! This is so embarrassing\u2026\u201dEven after knowing what Lortel did, she didn\u2019t deny or swear at Lortel\u2019s methods.Lortel finally understood why everyone loved Yennekar.A girl who walked straight out of a fairytale.But this description of her, of someone who was cute and lively, also had a subtle diss.It could also mean that she was someone who didn\u2019t know much about the world, someone who had lived in a flower garden all her life. It sounded like that to Lortel.But they must have severely misjudged Yennekar.She understood the darkness of the other side of the world, she just chose to continue living her life without losing her cheerful nature.To be standing in front of such dazzling light, someone with a black heart would crawl back into the darkness in shame.If everyone lived in dirt together, then being dirty would be the standard appearance of all humans. But that was just an illusion, of course.Because there would definitely be people like Yennekar. And it wasn\u2019t like Lortel didn\u2019t know that.\u201cEd is probably someone who\u2019s much more strong-willed and funnier than you think.\u201d\u201cWhat? Is that so? But why do you think so?\u201dYennekar giggled and spun around, untying her braid.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201dLortel then realized they had arrived in front of Yennekar\u2019s room.Once Yennekar entered the room, she planned on relaxing comfortably by untying her braids and loosening the straps on her cute and frilly casual clothes.\u201cWell, the spirits always keep gossiping amongst themselves, but whenever something stands out, it seems very stalkerish.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t being friendly with spirits something to be proud of?\u201d\u201cThanks for saying that~ Hehe~ But I\u2019m the only one in the whole world who knows those fun facts.\u201dYennekar spun in front of her door and smiled brightly. Only she knew what the spirits had told her about Ed.\u201cI should get going now. Dean McDowell told me I should try and sign a contract with another high-ranking spirit next month. In order to do that, I have to study and prepare a lot of things.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just sign a contract with a high-ranking fire spirit?\u201d\u201cThese days, expectations from me have risen quite a bit. I need to work hard, hmm. Yeah, it\u2019s a good thing that people were expecting a lot from me.\u201dAfter saying that, Yennekar opened her door wider.\u201cAhh, that\u2019s right. Lortel.\u201dYennekar said her name with her unique and charming smile.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about last time. You got hurt a lot because of me, right? I hope you get better soon.\u201dYennekar slowly closed the door after saying that, looking relieved. And Lortel herself saw how much consideration Yennekar had for her for saying that.In front of the softly-closed door, Lortel thought it over for a long time.Ed Rothstaylor is definitely an interesting person.Lortel couldn\u2019t guess why Yennekar had such a high opinion of him.Looking back, there was a strange sense of danger in her lively and relaxed appearance.But no matter how hard she thought of what the reason might be, she couldn\u2019t come up with a clear answer right away.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 6Intelligence: 5Dexterity: 9Willpower: 8Luck: 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226b[ Newly Crafted Product ]Farming Fishing NetAfter weaving the net, it is installed onto a branch so it wouldn't collapse into the flowing stream.Caught fish could be kept alive for several days.Production Difficulty Level: \u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Production completed.

I made the fishing net for about half of it and used up the net immediately. But for the other half, I set up something like a hammock, making it a good resting place. I thought it wouldn\u2019t be so bad so I was quite satisfied with the results.I started to become greedy as my living space became more and more furnished. My diet had also diversified and improved in one way or another. And above all else, the amount of physical strength I needed to use had decreased a lot.In the past, running to the academic district rendered me exhausted the entire day. But I had started being able to lightly walk even on my way back just recently.Even if I were to fall asleep late at night, I could open my eyes feeling refreshed the next morning.I was becoming more and more confident and satisfied with this life.[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Low-grade MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700 Fast Casting Lvl 2\u0700 Mana Sense Lvl 5Fire Element Magic:\u0700 Ignite Lvl 10Wind Element Magic:\u0700 Wind Blade Lvl 10Since I hadn\u2019t been able to use any intermediate magic properly just yet, I could still only use two beginner magic skills. But since I could repeatedly practice these skills until I was sick of them, and because I was in an environment where I could only survive by actually maintaining a fire going, I was able to reach my initial goal of having a skill reach level 10.So if I focused on casting them, I was now able to knock down a thick tree in one fell swoop. Even controlling the campfire became a piece of cake.Of course, I wasn\u2019t able to use it freely since my inherent mana capacity was rather small. But with this, only a few of the first-years would be more skilled than I was when it came to\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0and\u00a0Ignite.After becoming more proficient in elemental magic, my daily life had become more convenient. Cutting firewood with just a small bit of magic or adjusting the fire during the night. It also helped a lot when processing materials for production.If I were being honest, I was actually having quite a lot of fun.Before going to the academic district in the morning, I looked at my camp, all of my things packed and ready to go. It may not be that amazing, but it was something I had built with my own two hands. And with this unknown sense of pride and satisfaction, I wanted to try doing many more things!First things first today, smoking meat was taking too much time and effort.I wondered if I could make a proper smoker so the smoke wouldn\u2019t spread and flow out. But I couldn\u2019t think of a good idea on how I should go about designing it.\u201cHm\u2026 I guess I could just make one some other time.\u201dAfter I finished trimming my bow, I checked on my laundry and then on my jerky on the drying rack, then sat back down by the fire.My schoolwork from today went somewhat well. After looking over Senior Professor Eskin\u2019s written assignment for Elemental Studies, I should be done for the day. Considering it was still early in the evening, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve developed quite the talent in managing my time and daily routine.I hummed while finishing up trimming my last arrow. These days, everything I did was producing better results so I couldn\u2019t help but feel good throughout the day.If I could somehow spend every normal day until graduation just like today, then, there wouldn\u2019t be any problems with my plan.Thinking about these relaxing thoughts, I wrapped up the day\u2014Bang!And just like that, a monster suddenly flew in, smashing through the drying rack that I worked so hard to make, its body rolling over on the ground before coming to a stop.A flock of birds flew overhead and a thick layer of dust obscured my view for a short while.When I looked down where I had been trimming my arrows, I saw a familiar witch hat that I was reluctantly getting used to.Sure enough, looking up a bit farther ahead was Lucy Mayreel on the ground, the smashed drying rack beside her. It was quite a spectacle to see her covered in dirt, face stuck on the trunk of an old tree.\u201cWh-what is this?\u201dI stood up, reacting a bit late. Lucy, who was lying down, responded slowly.\u201cI almost died\u2026\u201dThat wasn\u2019t a line I expected to come out of Lucy\u2019s mouth.Why was this girl, who was supposed to be walking around, floating like some sort of spirit, suddenly fall here in such a way?From what I knew, the only one in this academy who could fight Lucy on equal footing was Headmaster Obel at best.But if there was someone who could fight her to the point of nearly killing her\u2026 then there must have been a variable I wasn\u2019t aware of somewhere.In this suddenly escalating crisis, I stood up quickly and asked Lucy.\u201cYou almost died. Just who was it?\u201d\u201cBe\u2026 Bell Maya\u2026\u201dThe name of a senior maid at Ophelis Hall.\u201cWhat the hell!\u201dI picked up the fire poker that I could grab nearest and threw it at Lucy. I thought it would just bounce off, but surprisingly, she didn\u2019t use any reactive defense magic to block it.The poker triggered her like a finger flick to the forehead, making her tear up and lay down on the ground. Ah, the black mark on her forehead was quite impressive.\u201cIs lying down here the right thing to be doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m out of mana\u2026\u201dThat speed that couldn\u2019t be followed by mere human eyes, not to mention the tremendous aftermath\u2026 it must mean she used the high-ranking spatial-type magic\u00a0Space Leap.High-ranking magic was something that even professors were only able to use by reciting the incantation with full concentration.\u201cAfter dinner, I was going to skip the monthly meeting called by the head of the dormitory, but I got caught\u2026\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cBell was so angry that she clenched her fist and came towards me.\u201dI began to remember some of Lucy\u2019s even scenes that I remembered. This troublemaker whom no one could contain had one natural enemy - it was none other than Bell Maya.Lucy had no way to deal with the incarnation of fear that was Bell, who would tighten her fists as if to attack whenever Lucy caused an accident, or forgot her schedule, or wasn\u2019t keeping a tidy appearance. It was a stance with a deep-rooted tradition of overpowering troublemakers such as Lucy.It would be a bit funny to see Lucy, an extraordinarily rare genius, being overpowered by one maid.However, no matter how talented Lucy was, she wouldn\u2019t do anything absurd enough to touch the maids of Ophelis Hall. It was an unwritten rule in Silvenia that the maids of Ophelis Hall, who supported students without an inch of error, must always be respected.Before such an unwritten rule even made its rounds, the students living in Ophelis Hall already subconsciously felt a sense of indebtedness to the maids.Even though they were students already used to always being treated with respect, the Ophelis Hall maids\u2019 competence was enough for them to still be in shock. That\u2019s why they were considered an elite group of maids. Housework such as cleaning and cooking were basic skills, but they could also support the student\u2019s academic life or even demonstrate simple magic.Since they were extremely faithful to their job of supporting the students, they never took unnecessary actions and most of them were reserved. This meant Bell Maya\u2019s rougher outer appearance and personality were not her individually.\u201cI thought that it would hurt so much so I ran away. It all happened so suddenly.\u201dIn short, Lucy applied \u2018fast casting\u2019 and \u2018wordless casting\u2019 with spatial-type magic to fly, not just a far distance, but all the way from Ophelis Hall to here.If you forcibly increased the casting speed or overlapped the casting, or if you were thinking about other things, the magic efficiency would be ruined. Such actions were cause for worry, not just two or three times more, but two or three times\u00a0squared\u00a0more. On top of that, the magic Lucy forcibly used was high-ranking magic, not to mention spatial-type magic.It was the equivalent of flying a private jet to a convenience store right in front of your house. It was only natural that even Lucy\u2019s magic, which was overflowing like the sea, would run out in an instant. You couldn\u2019t even call Headmaster Obel over for this type of thing.Thinking about this absurd situation, I was left speechless.Bell Maya, who was very angry, approached her with a whirling fist, so like a cat who jumped on a cucumber that fell on the side of the road, Lucy flew all the way over here.Lucy, still on the ground in her loose pajamas, let out a whine.\u201cSo tiring\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you deserve?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m having an especially hard time these days. Particularly because of that senior maid who became extra sensitive\u2026\u201d\u201cBell Maya?\u201dThat robot-like maid who was always focused on her responsibilities without a change in her facial expression?\u201cYou might not be able to tell from the outside but I could\u2026 She\u2019s really sensitive nowadays\u2026 I guess there is someone she is worried about\u2026 But being like that, I wonder if her anger would fall on me too\u2026\u201dLucy, who was covered in dirt from lying on the ground like that, finally began to say it.\u201cYou know\u2026?\u201dShe would always say the same thing whenever she knew I was here. The end of her sentence was obvious without even having to hear the rest of her words.\u201cDo you have any beef jerky?\u201dShe must be really craving it.I took a deep breath and raised my finger, pointing at her.At the spot where Lucy had flown in and crashed into, were the remains of the drying rack and the strips of jerky that were drying on it.Needless to say, the jerky had fallen on the floor and was covered in dirt, obviously in a state where they couldn't be eaten.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dLucy\u2019s face quickly turned blue at the sight. I took advantage of that moment to flick my finger on her forehead.Lucy, who had no magic power left, just rolled on the floor, screaming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (1)The true nature of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 would start to appear the more you play it.The game was filled with small details that unexpectedly had an intent and meaning. Not to mention the fact that the story was full of hidden episodes where you could learn new things about characters, even the ones who were already out of the story.The game put so much effort into fleshing out the characters of various students, the faculty, and the side characters, that it created an immersive experience for the player. This was what made the players want to play the next episode immediately after finishing a chapter.This was also why it felt so impossibly unfair that I became a character whose role was done the minute the story began, and then, later on, was shown as a beggar.But that wasn\u2019t my point.My point was that, given how huge the story was, it was obvious how all characters could be given the same level of importance.It was only natural that there would be important and influential characters, and characters who would just be there in the backdrop.But there was at least one time when I felt this shouldn\u2019t have been the case.\u2018Inquirer Glast\u2019 was the Act 2 boss, while \u2018The Awakened Lucy\u2019 would be for Act 3, and of course, Act 4\u2019s boss was \u2018The Head of the House, Krepin Rothstaylor\u2019.It was clear the developers put more effort into making these bosses. They all had a variety of motives and circumstances and were coming from different backgrounds, resulting in a situation where they were blocking the main character Taylee.Defeating each boss gave the players a strange sense of appreciation for their aesthetics and their values, and the variety of powers they possessed.But that feeling didn\u2019t exist for the Act 1 boss, \u2018Yennekar Palerover.\u2019She was the only boss who had no sense of identity.She fell victim to the whispers of the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper. She released all the spirits she made contracts with using Velosper\u2019s \u2018Berserk\u2019 and wreaked havoc on the Student Center atop Nail Hall. Yennekar stood there and watched as the darkness took over the buildings\u2026 it definitely had some great impact.It left a strong first impression on players due to the gap between that image and when she was running around campus full of energyBut that was it.The Glasskan Subjugation Expedition marked the end of Act 1. It was the episode where Tayle realized the ways of the sword and succeeded in cutting down a high-ranking spirit for the first time, signaling the start of the game\u2019s grand story.I even had to consult an online guide to beat the chapter because the difficulty level was quite high. What was the nickname of the person who wrote the strategy? Was it Peppero? But yeah, it was such an old distant memory that it seemed useless to think about it now.Anyway, my point was that Yennekar was pushed to the sidelines due to the entire chapter focusing on Taylee\u2019s growth. Her story, and thus, many parts about her ended up becoming unknown.All they said about her was how she fell victim to the cruel whispers of Velosper and had her heart swallowed up by the darkness. It was so vague, what else could I do but move on?But I knew the game would never waste such an important character like that.They didn\u2019t even use some other character, but specifically used Yennekar as the final boss of Act 1. There must definitely be a reason, or maybe a message they were trying to convey.But till the very end of the game, no such thing was found. I passionately analyzed and thought about this plot point a lot as a dedicated fan of the game. But I didn\u2019t have many clues to go on.Maybe there were parts that got cut off during the production? Or maybe during the quality control inspection process?In the end, this part of the game left me feeling unsatisfied.Oh well, there wasn\u2019t anything that could be done about it anyway.\u201cJust as I thought. I need to build a cabin.\u201dI said with full determination.I had already raised my Vitality. I was now able to prepare materials faster using magic. And I had already gathered food to the extent that I didn\u2019t need to worry about what to eat the next day.With these things established, I needed to start working on the basics to survive in the forest long-term.I couldn\u2019t even lie and tell you the wooden shelter I had right now was durable. It wasn\u2019t useful enough for the amount of work I do to maintain it.A shelter without a proper roof and walls would have awful heating options. Of course, the weather was still good as it was still spring, but I had to take into consideration the fact that I had to spend three winters in this forest. This wooden shelter couldn\u2019t guarantee me a safe living accommodation, given how it kept on falling apart every other day.But not only that! My production skills would exponentially increase if I were to do long-term projects like building a wood cabin.This would be a great opportunity for me to raise my Daily Life Production Skills in one go, given how its increase had gotten slower. My Handicraft proficiency had been stuck at level 10 for a while now, and my Design proficiency\u2019s growth had been too slow, although this was indeed relatively difficult to raise compared to other skills.The goal was to utilize Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s innate talent in production. The only option for him was to focus on developing his production skills, which would positively affect his stats.This was no different from reality or other games. If you had a special talent, take advantage of it.\u201cHm\u2026 Come to think of it, I heard he already defeated the mid-stage boss for Act 1.\u201dIt seemed that there hadn\u2019t been any unexpected variables that would change the story\u2019s original progression.Lucy did beat Taylee up pretty badly during the Joint Combat Practice, but it didn\u2019t seem to be too big of a variable given how he still defeated the mid-stage boss \u2018Nosy Elvira\u2019 from the Alchemy Department. It was said that she passed out after being hit by Taylee.I also hear Princess Penia frequently visited the student council, and there had already been talks among faculty members about her being a candidate as the next student council president.There was also the episode where Lortel reconciled with Yennekar and seeing how Lortel\u2019s visit was a while ago, things seemed to be going well on that front as well.There was no reason for me to worry about the story\u2019s progression given how everything seemed to be going according to the timeline that I knew of.Besides, why do I keep on worrying about things I could do nothing about? What I needed to do was continue developing myself and taking care of the things I needed to do so I can live a comfortable life.\u201cI need to make myself busy\u2026\u201dI still had a bit of time before Act 1 finished. I also had to solve my tuition issue. Thankfully, my grades are coming along fairly decently, so I thought I could expect some surprisingly positive results.I began cleaning the fish I caught on my farm with a satisfied smile on my face. I actually caught a fairly large rockfish. This would be my first time cooking a fish like it so I thought a lot about how I should go about approaching it.Well, simple salt on the grill should make it delicious.Yeah, I should cook that for dinner. And using the herbs I had collected with Bell Maya\u2019s advice, I would also make some fragrant herbal tea to drink while I study later in the evening.Yennekar Palerover took over the Student Center the evening after tomorrow.The final phase of Act 1 came a month earlier.It was a catastrophic and unexpected change.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u203b This is PepperoPepe\u2019s \u2018How to Attack the Act 1 Boss for Beginners: Detailed as Much as Possible!\u2019(http://tuosihtepyttnodesaelp.co.kr/memopad15263)This is a summary of the basic information and strategies.\u203b If you want a more detailed strategy guide, please refer to the original article!1-10 Act 1: Final ChapterBoss: Elementalist Yennekar (The Elemental Summoner)This boss has a total of 5 phases.

I already selected the important information and summarized everything so please make sure to check the whole guide before entering the final stage.Good luck!* * *I heard an owl\u2019s cries somewhere in the dark forest.The cicadas buzzed along in harmony with the occasional sound of the leaves shaking in the wind.I realized that even the forest had its own charm in the middle of the night.I looked up at the countless stars that filled the sky like sand on a beach and had a sentimental thought strike me.I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how trivial the struggles I went through were from the perspective of this vast universe.It was such a useless though.But then another thought came to mind.There were no guarantee things would progress exactly as they did in the official timeline.That extremely obvious fact was so abrupt that I couldn\u2019t help but smile.I had already adjusted to this lifestyle. But I shouldn\u2019t completely lose my sense of urgency.I made up my mind and threw the poker into the campfire.It was time to end the day.I stretched my body before quietly laying down in my shelter.I hoped tomorrow would be another peaceful day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (2)An unexpected incident happened after two nights.I lived my days the same as every day. I went to the academic district in the morning and would come back to my camp afterward.I would\u2019ve usually already left the academic district by dinner time, but I somehow ended up staying quite late today.I set a goal to have a safer living environment for myself and to do that, I was going to build a proper wood cabin.The library was a great resource to learn the basic design of how to build one. It also had information on the necessary materials and how to properly cut down the trees to use.I didn\u2019t really need to worry about food anymore, and there wasn\u2019t anything that needed my urgent attention or couldn\u2019t be put off until the weekend, like homework. So I thought it should be fine if I stayed late in the academic district today.Nothing good ever came out of getting lazy after already deciding to work on it. I should use this time to collect information to build my cabin.Since I was so used to living life by the hour, it only made sense that I did everything I needed to do at the library all out once while I was already here. After all, the northern forest and the library were so far away from each other that it wasn\u2019t efficient to take frequent trips to and fro.The library also had a limit to how many books a student could check out, and I had already exceeded that limit for my academic studies. So since I was already here anyway, might as well get all the reading I could.It was around the time that I was passionately focused on reading for my cabin and had books piling up around me that I heard someone.\u201cIt\u2019s already closing time. You have been studying quite hard.\u201dAnother student approached me. She gave off a warm impression and was modest in appearance.I looked around and saw that I was the only one left. It seemed that time had passed by quickly while I was focused on my research.I hadn\u2019t even eaten dinner yet but now it was already time for the library to close down.I looked at the student who approached me and saw she had a blue badge on her chest. This meant she was a first-year and I could speak casually to her.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt had already grown dark outside the window.I looked at the books piled up like a mountain beside me. The librarian would have a hard time organizing all of these right before closing time.\u201cI would have cleaned up in advance if I had known earlier.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. You were totally focused so I actually felt sorry having to bother you.\u201dShe had light pink curly hair. I couldn\u2019t seem to remember her well\u2026 and yet I had this strange feeling that I had seen her before.Oh, she was an apprentice librarian at Silvenia\u2019s student library. What was her name? Moka? Elka? Delka? What was it\u2026 at the very least, she wasn\u2019t a main character in the story.\u201cEven though I know I should study, all I had been doing was sitting around eating snacks and gaining weight\u2026 Oh my! I overshared, didn\u2019t I? What am I saying?!\u201dI answered her half-heartedly as I closed the book. I planned to construct the base by the end of the day but I don\u2019t think that was still feasible.\u201cEven still, seeing an upperclassman like you motivates me to study harder. You don\u2019t come here often, but every time you do, you are always focused and so immersed in your reading that I can\u2019t help but respect you so much for it.\u201dShe smiled.\u201cMy name is Elka Islan.\u201dIt seemed she had been wanting to talk to me for quite some time now, considering how the flow of the conversation so naturally lead to an introduction.\u201cEd.\u201d\u201c......\u201dThis reaction of them freezing up after they heard my name had become all too familiar now, and honestly, had rather become boring.Though it had been a while since the entrance exam, rumors about Ed Rothstaylor never stopped. I had tried to stay on the down-low as much as possible, kept to myself, and studied quietly, doing what I needed to do. But it seemed my reputation hadn\u2019t gotten any better.Just how arrogant and hateable was this guy?I mean, in the first place, rumors never seemed to flow in a positive direction, but they always tend to flow smoothly like oil in a negative direction instead.I was not so naive to be upset and offended by every single rumor, but I couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh each time I get the occasional reaction like this.\u201cThis\u2026 might be a bit rude but\u2013\u201dNevertheless, if I lived as quietly as I could just doing what I had to do, all while diligently studying every day and striving to survive day by day, they would come a time when people\u2019s perception may change completely.\u201cYou\u2019re very different from the rumors.\u201d\u201cThe rumors?\u201d\u201cNo, uhm\u2026 I hope you don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird but\u2026\u201dIt was quite rude of her to be bringing up rumors. I should just go and quickly head back to camp. It was already pretty late.But she kept going on.\u201cI usually spend my time here at the library after school since I\u2019m an apprentice librarian. And every few days, you would borrow Elemental Studies books, right?\u201c......\u201d\u201cYou read and returned dozens of books with hundreds of pages each in just a few days, and you read five or six books all in just one sitting\u2026 seeing things like that makes me wonder if the rumors about you being arrogant while not knowing anything were actually lies\u2026 ack! S-Sorry if I offended you.\u201dShe suddenly hesitated to talk and quickly picked up the books.\u201cA-Anyways, I should clean this up quickly and head back to the dormitory. Have a safe trip back!\u201dShe talked in a hurry and rank away, right into a bookshelf.Then, out of nowhere,\u00a0 the bookshelves began to fall down like dominoes.* * *Living life outside of the main story could be quite exhausting.I couldn\u2019t help but feel helpless, put in a position where I had no choice but to accept the always-changing situations.\u201cEunghk!\u201dI pulled out the struggling librarian trapped under the bookshelves and put her on top of a table.It had been fifteen minutes since a thunderous sound reverberated throughout the academic district, and a great tremor struck the entire student library.Justifiably similar to an earthquake, the aftermath was just as enormous. The bookshelves had fallen all over, as did the books which had rolled over on the floor. The reading materials and even the consumables had become a mess.Even the expensive magic tools had smashed into pieces and the crystal orb, which acted as a light source, as well as all the candles, had gone out, rendering the library completely dark inside.\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cEgh\u2013\u201dShe seemed to have fainted, only mumbling out randomly.I thought about it for a while. I couldn\u2019t remember her clearly, but I had this weird feeling that I had seen her somewhere before. Considering I had played the game multiple times, I couldn\u2019t remember her, then she probably wasn\u2019t anyone important.It was probably already past 9 o\u2019clock, and there was no source of light left inside.However, I spotted a sort of soft purple coming from inside the reading room. My eyes hadn\u2019t fully adjusted in the dark yet but I was still able to roughly see it.After looking at it some more, I was surprised to realize it was actually coming from out the window.I went over and opened it. The student library was located on a small hill on the outskirts of the academic district, allowing me to see an entire view of the whole place.There was a reddish pillar of light coming from the Student Center. It crossed over the sky above the academic district, triggering a spatial seal barrier that circled around the whole area.The earthquake was surely the aftermath of casting such large-scale spatial sealing magic. And the fact that it was coming from the Student Center made it clear.\u201cHmm\u2026 Isn\u2019t this a bit early\u2026?\u201dEither way, there was nothing to be flustered about.Although I had been suffering from all sorts of hardships in Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s pathetic body, at least I had the advantage of knowing the information I knew.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI scratched my chin as I thought about it.I didn\u2019t know if this was something I should be worried about but there were still quite a few things I didn\u2019t quite understand.The first of which is the spatial-sealing magic activated by the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper through Yennekar. Velosper used the high-ranking dark magic\u00a0Shadow Curtain\u00a0to block off the entirety of the academic district from the outside.It was an impressive barrier, but it was just a plot device to set the stage.This was the Glasskan subjugation chapter. It was the episode that marked the finale of Act 1 and brought out all the all-star first-year students to join together and form a subjugation squad to attack the Student Center.But if you were to use your common sense, you would realize that this shouldn\u2019t have been possible.Glasskan was the most infamous high-ranking dark spirit among the elemental spirits. This shouldn\u2019t have been an issue solved by mere students. If the Student Center had been taken over, it should\u2019ve been the faculty members and professors who would\u2019ve obviously come to defeat it.That was why it didn\u2019t make any sense. In order to create an episode where Taylee could manifest the\u00a0Swordmaster\u2019s Skill, the developers made it necessary to block the faculty and professors from intervening.Hence Velosper\u2019s spatial-sealing magic.It was a barrier that locked everything from the inside. This made it easy to realize the space was locked from the inside, but it made it hard for those on the outside.And even if those from the outside were to recognize the barrier, it would still take them almost half a day to destroy the dark magic barrier using standard methods. The only way to quickly break through would be to use overwhelming destructive power.But using such an ignorant method would seem impossible. Although, as this was Solvenia, there were a few people who should be capable of doing such a feat. No need to look that far since Headmaster Obel would be able to destroy the entire barrier without even needing to examine it first.But the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper was cunning.This event happened late in the evening when most professors have already returned to their private labs or homes.It was already 9 o\u2019clock, which meant only a few professors would\u2019ve been remaining in the academic district as the professors\u2019 private lavs were grouped around their living quarters for convenience.Either way, the Act 1 finale was a battle against time.The goal was to defeat Yennekar before she could summon the highest-ranking dark spirit Glasskan before sunrise.Even though it would be destroyed anyway if left alone, it still delayed time enough for Glasskan\u2019s summoning to complete.I looked out the window and stuck my head out. It didn\u2019t seem like the spirits Yennekar had manifested were occupying the streets yet.\u201cI guess we haven't entered the first phase yet.\u201dThe flow of this Act\u2019s boss battle was as follows:Gathering a Subjugation ForceOperation Reclaim the Student CenterThe Battle at Nail Hall\u2019s CorridorFinal PhaseGlasskan SubjugationThis would start now and would end before dawn.Simply put, this was going to be extremely difficult. I couldn\u2019t help but pray for Taylee.I had to run around like crazy during Phase 1. I felt like a real idiot running all over the academic district trying to find all the scattered aces of the first-years to bring them all into one place, all while having to subdue all the spirits on the streets.\u201cHe should\u2019ve met up with Ayla by now.\u201dI was sure he\u2019d have figured out the solution by now.Taylee\u2019s childhood friend Ayla was well-versed in Spiritual Studies. And with all that spiritual energy flowing around the Student Center, she would have already told Taylee what was going on.The students needed to start working together from now on to defeat that monster of a dark spirit Velosper. Because the moment Glasskan gets summoned, the damage to the whole academic district would be indescribable. That\u2019s why gathering all the people who would help at the Student Square was needed.The soft purple I could see outside the window soon changed into an ominous dark red. The chanting to summon Glasskan must\u2019ve already begun.And it was clear who was doing it.The cute Elementalist star student who was admired and loved by all the second-years, that's who.\u201cLooking at it from here, it\u2019s quite the scene.\u201dTaylee should already be right next to the Student Center the moment the barrier magic was cast.The barrier\u2019s mana flow exploded, creating a reddish curtain covering the starless sky. I was large enough to cover the entire academic district.It could obviously be assumed that a large-scale event had begun just from seeing the barrier.Be it Glasskan or something else, I was sure Taylee would figure it out and solve it. Even if I just spend my time here sitting around reading books, this whole thing would eventually end.There was no reason for me to go out there and suffer. It would be better if I spent my energy and efforts on building my cabin instead. Getting unnecessarily involved could only get me hurt or suffer one way or another.Plus I didn\u2019t want to go where all the important characters in the story should be gathered by now. My biggest weapons were knowing the future and having inside information. Getting myself involved and creating an unknown variable would be like stupidly giving up my powerful weapons.\u201cWait\u2026\u201dHowever, a thought suddenly occurred to me.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the time for that thing?\u201dI sat on top of the library table looking at the imposing barrier.I remembered something from a strategy article I read a long time ago.If you intend on investing in your Alchemy or Spiritual Skills in the future, it will be beneficial to improve your Spirit Understanding and Spirit Resonance during this phase.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThe final stage of Act 1 was where dozens of spirits that signed a contract with Yennekar would manifest and show up. There would also be a large number of Fluid Spirits.It was an opportunity to improve my proficiency in both the annoying\u00a0Spirit Understanding\u00a0and\u00a0Spirit Resonance\u00a0at the same time.Spirit-type skill proficiency could only be accumulated through contact with a spirit. Whether it be through communication or contact, there needed to be an exchange with the spirit to increase one\u2019s proficiency. Combat experiences were great for filling up this proficiency.The problem was that ordinary people couldn\u2019t even see a spirit, that was unless they were lucky enough to be born with a tremendous amount of Spirit Resonance like Yennekar.The only way for ordinary people to come in contact with a spirit was with those manifested by an Elementalist.Spirit-related skills had such an exclusive requirement that acted like a difficult barrier. But the chance to easily overcome that difficult barrier is here, in the final chapter of Act 1.Because Yennekar was an Elementalist who manifested many spirits during this stage, this was somewhere you could accumulate a lot of combat experience through defeating them.It would be foolish of me to just sit around while an event as generous as a pot of gold was handing out experience points right around the corner.In addition, this would be an actual battle.The amount of experience I would get was gonna be very different from the type I would gain from mock battles throughout the school curriculum.My top priority right now should be to defeat as many spirits as possible and focus on my own growth.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been spacing out.\u201dI quickly jumped off the table and opened the door, ready to leave, when the apprentice librarian laying on the table caught my eye.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t think there would be any danger of being inside the library building but just in case, I picked up a piece of parchment and quill that I saw scattered about.\u201cDon\u2019t panic when you wake up. And stay right here. Everything should be over before daybreak so you should stay calm and block the entrance. And don\u2019t provoke the spirits. Always think about your own safety first and don\u2019t hastily move about.\u201dHmm\u2026 it didn\u2019t feel right just leaving one note behind.It was unlikely for a wandering spirit to invade the library\u2019s reading room and suddenly start attacking a sleeping girl, but there was still a possibility. If she were to get unnecessarily hurt or her life gets ruined\u2026 living with the guilt would leave a bitter taste in my mouth.I picked up a blackboard that fell over in the corner and grabbed a piece of chalk that was laying around. Then I wrote the same thing again, only in large letters. Just in case she missed my note on the paper.I covered all the windows before leaving, making it less dangerous since the spirits wouldn\u2019t be able to see inside. I also took a blackout curtain laying around and roughly covered the exit as it looked to be too wide open. Doing this, I hoped the entrance could be hidden and escape would be possible if she needed to.Covering everything made it a little bit darker inside. But since I wrote my note on the board, she should still be able to see it.It should be fine now.I hurriedly ran towards the hallway. There would be an event to gain lots of experience starting soon. I needed to move quickly.I should be able to easily handle Fluid Spirits, even Elemental Traces. I should even be able to defeat a low-ranking spirit if I really tried.As the player, I had to prioritize how to defeat that monster Velosper over my own growth, but now, thankfully, there was someone who could take that responsibility and handle all the hardships and adversities for me.Taylee.He could just figure it out and take care of it.It would probably be a lot of work\u2026Well, good luck to him!* * *\u201cNo matter what type of burden I may carry, it shouldn't be any heavier than the weight the princess carries.\u201d\u201cWhile it's definitely necessary to pay attention to politics and social problems, why don't you try putting your mind at ease? This isn\u2019t a place where the royal family needs to establish authority over everything\u2026 it\u2019s just Silvenia Academy.\u201dEd Rothstaylor\u2019s words suddenly came to mind.Though she could easily see into the hearts of others, very rarely had she had the experience of someone else taking a look into hers. This was why she couldn\u2019t easily forget it.His blunt matter-of-fact words that he indifferently told the princess.She thought she still had a long way to go\u2026But she once again set her mind straight.\u201cThis is the situation right now.\u201dA first-year named Ayla completely summarized the situation to them.Their temporary meeting place was the Student Square at 11:30 PM.This meant it had already been nearly two hours since the catastrophe had occurred.The square was packed with students who were trapped by Velosper\u2019s barrier.They collected all sorts of junk lying around and created a barricade around the fountain in the middle, blocking the entrance from the north, south, east, and west. Although crude, it provided them cover, at the very least, and blocked the spirits scattered about from coming in.\u201cThere was no way this massive barrier would last this long. It\u2019ll be discovered quickly and help will come from the outside. Once they notice it, the professors will surely come to help.\u201dThe crowd nodded their heads at Ayla\u2019s words.Princess Penia became the head of their temporary base, as voluntarily decided amongst the students.The most important thing in a crisis like this was a person who could take charge and control the situation. A person with legitimate authority and power who could control such a chaotic situation.Needless to say, Princess Penia was the best person for the role in their current situation. No one could question her authority.There were a total of 57 students gathered in the Student Square.This was largely attributed to Taylee McLaure, a freshman in the Combat Department. He plowed his way through the hordes of spirits occupying the academic district and acted as a messenger so that all the students could gather in one place.The result was more than half of the remaining students in the district were gathered together.The students who could be considered the core of the group were having a meeting at the center of the camp.These were The Benevolent Princess Penia, The Golden Daughter Lortel, The Spear from Nature Ziggs, Head Escort Claire, Failed Swordmaster Taylee, Companion Ayla, Nosy Elvira, Gloomy Clevius\u2026They were freely discussing the countermeasures they could take as they sat on the floor, while others leaned against the barricade, or modestly stood around. All the while, Princess Penia was at the center of it all.\u201cJust like I said a while ago, I believe we should enter the Student Center even if it was just us.\u201dThat was Taylee, who was covered in wounds due to making his way through hordes of spirits to gather everyone.He was standing up with that body full of small cuts and wounds, clearly stating his stance.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait for outside support. That barrier was purposefully made to stall help. There may be a large number of casualties if Glasskan gets summoned as Ayla said.\u201dComing from Ayla who was well versed in spirit-type magic and Taylee who ran around the whole scene\u2026 this information was shocking.The spiritual skill covering the night sky was magic used to summon the highest dark spirit Glasskan.There were only a few students in Silvenia with a good enough\u00a0Spirit Resonance\u00a0to be able to summon a spirit like that.Using the process of elimination, the culprit was probably the second-year star student Yennekar Palerover.\u201cPrincess Penia, I disagree with this plan. The most important thing here is the princess\u2019s safety. To act conservatively, the princess shouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave this base.\u201dOf course, Head Escort Claire only thought about Princess Penia\u2019s safety.\u201cPeople outside the barrier will notice soon enough. It should be resolved quickly once the Imperial Guard station and the professors take action.\u201d\u201cA barrier cast by a high-ranking dark spirit can not be easily removed unless broken by force. And to be honest, I\u2019m not sure if they will make it in time. I\u2019m not sure if Headmaster Obel will personally come, since you know he tends to be away often.\u201dClaire\u2019s words were rebutted by the Alchemy Department\u2019s first-year star student, Nosy Elvira. She was an alchemist who had a tomboy appearance.\u201cHmmm~ I agree with Taylee. Above all, if all the students of this quality were to work together, while it might be too much to take down Glasskan, don\u2019t you think we would be able to at least defeat a high-ranking dark spirit like Velosper? Hmmm~ Honestly, do you guys not have the confidence at all?\u201d\u201cSo, you want us to breakthrough\u2026 over there\u2026? Eeek\u2026 Nope\u2026\u201dA male student with dark circles around his eyes called Gloomy Clevius pointed towards the Student Center.The Fluid Spirits and low-raking spirits scattered about the academic district weren\u2019t that dangerous. If all the students here stuck together, then it should be 100% safe.But the situation at the Student Center was completely different.That was where the owner of all these spirits was located, Yennekar Palerover. There should be two or three times the amount of all sorts of mid-ranking spirits and even a spiritual beast standing guard.\u201cYou want us to push through all the mid-ranking spirits, defeat them, enter the building and then stop Yennekar? Is\u2026 is that even possible? That probably isn\u2019t even everything! There are also two high-ranking spirits inside! The high-ranking fire spirit Takan and the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper.\u201dEveryone fell silent at Clevius\u2019s words.They had all seen the power of a high-ranking spirit during the Join Combat Practice class. Takan was a giant fire-lizard that wrapped around the top of Nail Hall and let out a roar.Even Lortel, who was one of the students Professor Glast recognized and assigned to Class A, was completely overpowered without being able to put up a fight.What\u2019s even worse was that this Takan was more powerful than before since all the spirits in the area were affected by Velosper\u2019s\u00a0Berserk\u00a0magic. And Takan was no exception to that.\u201cI won't commit suicide like that! I won\u2019t!\u201d\u201cPlease calm down, Clevius.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Princess Penia.\u201dClevius bowed his head at Princess Penia's words.However, the words Clevius said had already affected the morale of the students around, making them feel despair.The 57 students in their small camp were wary of the situation. Their conversation could be heard by everyone, and she couldn\u2019t have anyone continue making such discouraging comments in this situation.\u201cEven if she is the top student among the second-years, isn\u2019t she a bit too strong? She already manifested this many spirits, can she even still summon Glasskan?\u201dAyla was the one to answer Lortel\u2019s question.\u201cMost of the power actually comes from Velosper. Yennekar is just a medium to express that power. That\u2019s why all Elementalists make sure to always have a clear mind so as not to be consumed by a dark spirit.\u201dPrincess Penia already knew what Ayla explained.Originally referred to as the natural enemy of an Elementalist, a dark spirit had an enormous amount of power but would never follow the will of an Elementalist.Rather, they were like demons who ruled over Elementalists and made them move according to their will.\u201cBut nobody knows how Velosper ended up taking control of Yennekar, who is more familiar with Spiritual Studies more than anyone else. She would definitely have known the dangers of a dark spirit better than anyone else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not important right now.\u201dThe Spear from Nature Ziggs, who was sitting in a corner, responded to Ayla.\u201cIsn\u2019t the important thing to do now is to figure out our course of action?\u201dA serious and dignified voice. The boy had long hair coming down just to his neck. He spoke indifferently, yet clearly.\u201cAnd the only person who can decide is\u2026 Princess Penia.\u201dSilence filled the air once again at Zigg\u2019s words.More than 50 students turned their eyes toward Princess Penia. Meanwhile, Head Escort Claire\u2019s worried gaze stung the princess\u2019s back.She understood that the most important thing for Claire was her safety. However, sitting around and waiting for help wasn\u2019t the princess\u2019s style.\u201cLet's enter the Student Center. If, by chance, we encounter anything different from what we expected, we will retreat.\u201dThe students had a divided response.Head Escort Claire and Gloomh Clevius, as well as the students who had a more conservative view, let out a heavy sigh. While the more proactive students let out a smile.\u201cHowever, there is no need for all the students to enter. Rushing in together will only increase the number of injuries. The right thing to do is to only enter with the people who are capable of taking care of themselves.\u201dA regular student would get swept away by a mid-ranking spirit, let alone a high-ranking spirit. There was no reason to take everyone.\u201cEveryone here, including my Head Escort Claire, the top students from each grade and department, as well as the Class A students, will all go. That\u2019s because your skills have already been verified.\u201d\u201cThen that means there is no reason for the princess to go?\u201d\u201cNo, I will also be accompanying them.\u201dClaire\u2019s face instantly became serious, like a flash of lightning. But Princess Penia shook her head.\u201cIt would be absurd not to go to the front lines when I am the one giving orders.\u201d\u201cPrincess, your body is not just your property. As a member of the royal knights, I have no choice but to stop you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Claire. I haven\u2019t been neglecting my magic training. Also, Taylee and Ayla, please accompany us as well. The two of you have walked around the outskirts of the Student Center while trying to search for students, so you probably somewhat already know the internal situation.\u201dAnd with that, the subjugation team members were decided. Sadly, none of the upperclassmen students were there. Except for Claire, who was an adult, everyone else was a first-year.However, each member of the team was a powerful student. The first-years had an unusual amount of strong students in the first place. Even though it was unfortunate that Lazy Lucy was nowhere to be found, even the upperclassmen wouldn\u2019t have been much better than this lineup they already had.\u201cWe will enter in an hour. Everyone, please finish your preparations. And also, prepare your heart.\"Everyone nodded their heads at the princess\u2019s words.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cPrincess! Princess Penia!\u201dA student came running in, breaking the solemn atmosphere.\u201cWe\u2019ve identified the remaining people in the academic districtA male student with reddish-brown hair came through the barricade and stood right in front of the princess. Identifying the number of people in a crisis was the most important thing to do.Time was crucial. The number of people trapped by the barrier in the academic district wasn\u2019t high since it happened when most people were already heading back to their living quarters. Thanks to this, they could somewhat estimate the overall number of people left by gathering information from the students with them.The male student who was in charge of investigating took in a big gulp of air as he began to report.\u201cThere were alchemy students at the Taneth Magic Supplies Storage. They were researching chemicals and started a sit-in of their own. There shouldn\u2019t be any reason for worry since they were mostly third-year students.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cThe faculty and staff who were in charge of locking the doors for the night, along with the building management, are gathered at Audrey Hall. However, as they are general staff, they don\u2019t have the means to deal with the spirits.\u201d\u201cDo they need support?\u201d\u201cI heard Professor Kali is in charge of that. However, it seems it would be difficult for them to join us.\u201dAlthough most of the professors would have already returned to their living quarters, it seemed that there was still a professor or two remaining.However, it would be difficult to take care of and manage all the general staff. The distance between where were and Audrey Hall was also quite far, so gathering those workers and having them move all the way here would be expecting a bit too much. However, they couldn\u2019t just be left unattended.\u201cThey have also decided to do a sit-in.\u201d\u201cYes, that is the best way to minimize damage. I shouldn\u2019t make a decision that would risk the safety of the administration and the teaching staff.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re the only ones who are capable of entering the Student Center.\u201dThe princess made up her mind once again. The place they were at was right in front of the center anyway. More than anything else, they were the ones who could quickly deal with the situation.\u201cOther than that, there was no other recognized stud\u2013\u201d\"There is!\"A girl raised her voice somewhere around the barricade.Everyone\u2019s eyes instantly went to her. A freshman girl was anxiously clenching her fist tightly, arms wrapped around her chest. With closed eyes, she shouted.\u201cI-I'm sorry... The atmosphere was too solemn so... I wasn't able to say anything.\u201d\u201cPlease explain in detail.\u201d\u201cI am\u2026 an apprentice librarian in charge of managing the student library. I\u2019m Tisika.... Actually, I still have a friend left behind at the student library.\u201dThe girl\u2019s twisted face looked like she was in pain. It seemed she was struggling to confess.\u201cWe usually close the library together, but there was someone in the reading room today and he wasn\u2019t leaving right until closing time. My friend said she would wait and close up the library herself, so she let me head back first. I was on my way home when\u2026\u201d\u201cThen that means there is one apprentice librarian and one student in the reading room who are still isolated. Wait\u2026 did you say librarian?\u201dZiggs stood up from his seat in the corner. He then approached the girl who was struggling to speak and looked her straight in the eyes before asking.\u201cYour librarian friend. What\u2019s her name?\u201d\u201cElka Islan.\u201dThe girl was sweating as she struggled to say her friend\u2019s name, trying to avoid Zigg\u2019s gaze.Zigg\u2019s eyes began to tremble as soon as he had confirmed the name.\u201cDid you say\u2026 Elka\u2026? Are you sure? You\u2019re sure you\u2019re not mistaken?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 we are learning how to manage magic books as apprentice librarians in class.\u201dZigg\u2019s clenched fist hit the barricade behind the girl. The girl was caught by surprise and closed her eyes, taking a step back. The barricade behind her made of wooden benches and various decorative objects had collapsed.\u201cShit! Princess Penia, I\u2019m going to go look for her now.\u201d\u201cZiggs?\u201d\u201cElka is really good at managing magic books and researching magic but she doesn\u2019t have the power to defend herself. She was just an aspiring scholar. If we leave her alone, she\u2019ll definitely be attacked by the spirits running rampant.\u201dZiggs walked back to the center of the camp and dropped to his knees in front of Princess Penia.\u201cI need to go to the student library and look for her right now.\u201d\u201cZiggs Eiffelstein, do you know that your words are filled with too much emotion?\u201dBut the one who responded was someone else\u2013The Golden Daughter Lortel.\u201cGoing from here to the library is going to take you too long, even if you run at full speed. You would also need to somehow pass through all those spirits. Who knows how long that would take? Rather than that, we need to prioritize stopping Yennekar right now. She\u2019s the cause of all of this, after all.\u201dA calm and assertive tone. A realistic plan.Polite and calm when talking to superiors, but relentless to those she considered as equals or lower.This was only natural for Lortel who grew up in the cold harsh reality of the Elte Company.\u201cI know you have some sort of attachment to Elka, Ziggs. But what we need right now is to figure out how this could work.\u201dElka Islan.\u2018The Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019 thought of her as his savior when he was near the end of the cliff.Elka supported and embraced Ziggs despite his lineage as part of the northern nomadic people. People who had walked a bloody path all their lives.Ziggs believed he could no longer live a normal life but Elka showed him what human warmth was.He remembered seeing her smile between the gaps of the thick magic books in the library\u2019s reading room. Because of her, Ziggs was able to leave his life as a bloodthirsty monster behind.For Ziggs, losing the smile of the girl who gave him a chance at a new life was more frightening than losing his own life.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBut at the same time, Lortel's words were irresistibly persuasive in that they were both rational and realistic.Lortel\u2019s words were always justified despite her being a sneaky and greedy merchant. That\u2019s just the type of person Lortel was.\u201cPlease calm down, Ziggs. Being this emotional isn\u2019t like you. Lortel had a point.\u201dZiggs had always been the calmest student among the three Class A appointees.Lucy was a weirdo while Lortel was always acting suspicious and was someone who couldn\u2019t be trusted. But unlike the two of them, Ziggs was always righteous and had common sense. He was also someone who communicated well. Zigg\u2019s calm demeanor actually earned him the catchphrase, \u201cIn Ziggs, we trust.\u201dBut that Ziggs and this Ziggs were vastly different. You didn\u2019t need Princess Penia\u2019s Insightful Eyes to know how important Elka was to Ziggs.\u201cTisika said there is still one other student in the library with her. Why don\u2019t you try trusting that student right now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Uhm\u2026\u201dIn front of them was the Student Center where the root of the problem was. It would be selfish to ignore that and run to the library.Ziggs knew that. That was why he couldn\u2019t refute the princess\u2019s words.\u201cAre you certain that there was another student with her, Tisika?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 That is\u2026\u201dTisika took a step back as sweat rolled down her face, avoiding eye contact with anyone.A sense of anxiety washed over the princess.\u201cIs there something you\u2019re trying to hide, Tisika?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Uhm\u2026 Eghh\u2026\u201dPaying no mind that he was in front of the princess, Ziggs kicked his chair and stood up once again.He quickly stomped over to Tisika and grabbed her by her collar.\u201cSay it right now!\u201d\u201cUhm... S\u2013 I'm sorry..!\"Tisika fell to her knees with tears in her eyes as she confessed.\u201cIt was\u2026 Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dAn ominous silence enveloped the group at the mention of the name.\u201cHe was just sitting there until late at night. And I didn\u2019t want to talk to him because he was so annoying. You know what I\u2019m talking about! What kind of person Ed Rothstaylor is! So I just left Elka to take care of everything. Elka\u2026 she isn\u2019t the type to care about rumors. And she didn\u2019t even know that student was Ed Rothstaylor so I thought it should be okay\u2026\u201dThe heavy feeling of guilt pushed her into a corner. The fact that she had taken advantage of her own friend was too heavy to bear.\u201cSo Elka let me leave early without making a fuss\u2026 that\u2019s what happened. I\u2019m\u2026 so sorry\u2026\u201dThe string of patience Ziggs was hanging onto finally snapped.Ed Rothstaylor.Ziggs was also taking the entrance exam when Ed came and caused a commotion. Ziggs had seen well enough just how ugly of a human being Ed was.\u201cLet go of me! Don\u2019t you know who I am? I am Ed Rothstaylor, the second son of the Rothstaylor family! Get your dirty hands off me, you pigs! Just where are you touching me?\u201d\u201cYou think I would stoop so low just to mess with a nobody failure like Taylee? Let go of me! These dirty and ignorant commoners! Do you even know what you're talking about!\u201d\u201cTaylee? Ha\u2026 A low-ranking failure of a student who's all talk.\u201dLuxuries and pleasures. Prideful and lazy. Incompetent too.Ed Rothstaylor was a pathetic human being with despicable qualities. He took advantage and threw away his closest friends when an opportunity arose, never caring about the kindness he had received. He was truly selfish in every sense of the word.It was obvious what everyone else at the base was whispering about.- \u201cEd? That Ed Rothstaylor? Doesn\u2019t this mean the librarian is in big trouble?\u201d- \u201cThere are so many rumors that he\u2019s seriously disgusting and pathetic.\u201d- \u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean the librarian is alone with such a person?\u201d- \u201cOh no...\u201dIt was too dangerous to leave the room with these many berserked spirits occupying the streets, let alone the building.The fact that that cruel Ed Rothstaylor and Elka were in such a situation\u2026Nothing good would come out of such a situation. Elka had no power in such an extreme situation, and she may even be taken advantage of by Ed Rothstaylor and thrown away. Or worse, he could even lay a finger on her fragile body.Ziggs had complete confidence he knew the type of person Ed was. The rumors about him also added credibility.The fact that Elka\u2019s fate rested in the hands of such a person made Ziggs lose all sense of reasoning.\u201cI\u2019m heading to the library right now.\u201dHis anger has already surpassed his limit. Rather than not, it now felt cold.Ziggs notified them in a soft subdued voice.The one he notified was The Benevolent Princess Penia herself, someone that even Headmaster Obel respected.Zigg\u2019s intentions were clear. He was rejecting a royal order.\u201cYou\u2019re crossing the line, Ziggs Eiffelstein.\u201dThe first person to step up was Head Escort Claire. But Ziggs didn\u2019t care.In Lazy Lucy\u2019s absence, no one among them could defeat The Spear from Nature Ziggs. Even Claire, who was a member of the Royal Guards, couldn\u2019t guarantee how many strikes she would be able to withstand.He was considered one of the best magicians amongst the first-years alongside Lazy Lucy and The Golden Daughter Lortel, the three of them recognized by Professor Glast solely for their skills.And as he was born among the northern nomads, he had been living his life with human blood on his hands for longer than he had matured.He had always lived a life at the crossroads between life and death, no one could compare to him in terms of practicality.If Lazy Lucy was like a tank or a fighter with how her magic cannot be blocked, then The Spear from Nature Ziggs was like a well-trained special agent his whole life. There may be a massive difference in terms of pure power and scale between the two of them, but within Zigg\u2019s specialized field, he would be able to fully dominate and demonstrate his power.And his specialized field was dueling with no outside interference.\u201cI\u2019ll beat anyone who tries to stop me from leaving.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201dThe Golden Daughter Lortel cast a spell. The moisture in the atmosphere froze in an instant, creating a huge ice spear in the air. It was\u00a0Ice Spear, the same intermediate magic that destroyed the ceiling of Nail Hall.The two first-year top students from the Magic Department of Silvenia. Ziggs and Lortel stared at each other. It was a rare scene for anybody to witness.Everyone gathered and watched nervously, swallowing their dry saliva at the sudden extreme turn of events.\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit, Ziggs. You are the strongest person amongst everyone here in terms of power. If you leave the subjugation, then our chance of success will sharply drop. Which is why, I\u2019m sorry but, you can\u2019t leave your position as a member of the team.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hilarious, Lortel. Do you think I\u2019ll cooperate if you try and force me to do so?\u201d\u201cYou have completely lost your mind. I know how much you cherish Elka, but you need to at least distinguish between your public and private life. Look over there.\u201dFollowing Lortel\u2019s gaze, everyone could see Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle gradually turning a darker shade of red. There was an assortment of spirits occupying the hall as well.\u201cAnd where would you be going to leave that behind?\u201dLortel looked Ziggs straight in the eyes. And she hated the burning passion within them.Passion, hot blood, spirit, loyalty, vigor, strong will.Lortel hated the fact that such words would show up in such an urgent situation.Humans needed to be calm and rational. No matter the predicament or harsh the situation may be, one needs to make the right judgement without being misled by wrong emotions.That was the type of person who would be extremely reliable.It didn\u2019t matter how many magic skills you knew, or how powerful you were. If your heart wasn\u2019t strong enough, then you couldn\u2019t be trusted. This was the first great principle that Lortel learned in business ethics.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to win over you in a one-on-one battle, Ziggs. But if I gave it my all, you wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away unscathed.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dZiggs was superior to Lortel in a duel. But that didn\u2019t mean Lortel was an easy opponent. They would be able to exchange even blows at first, but over time, someone would eventually get extremely hurt.It was too much pressure just for Ziggs to push through all the spirits and head to the library. And yet Ziggs shook his head.\u201cIf that's your opinion, then I have no intention of giving up either.\u201dThe atmosphere between the two shifted to that of one just before a big fight. The atmosphere where if one so much as steps forward, the fight would begin\u2026\u201cWhat are you two doing?! What would happen if we fight amongst ourselves?!\u201dPrincess Penia had reached her limit and shouted.\u201cBut Princess Penia! Right now\u2026 that Ed Rothstaylor\u2026\u201dZiggs responded. But his forceful words grew rather tame towards the end.With a face of complete desperation, Ziggs spoke in between tears. He was no longer the strong-minded and reliable The Spear from Nature Ziggs.\u201cIf something happens to Elka, I really\u2026 I won\u2019t know how to live anymore.\u201dHis tone had shifted from anger to sadness, and now desperation.Princess Penia did not expect this reaction.She would have scolded a furious Ziggs for his actions and taken control of the situation. But this Ziggs had now completely become desperate, so clearly visible with the princess\u2019s Insightful Eyes.His heart was more desperate than a dying man\u2019s. Elka was truly like family to him.\u201cB-But\u2026\u201dPrincess Penia stuttered at his sincere desperation. No sounds came out even though her mouth was open.\u201cThat guy. Ed Rothstaylor. Princess Penia, you also know what he\u2019s like\u2026!\u201dPrincess Penia, you also know what he\u2019s like.She couldn\u2019t nod her head at the words.Because she didn\u2019t actually know anything about him.Her thoughts were complicated when it comes to Ed Rothstyalor. Even the most obvious facts about him had become a fogged mystery.The clear image she gets when looking into somebody\u2019s inner self, and yet she couldn\u2019t even manage to figure out the outline of the guy.What was their current situation?They were in an extreme crisis where nothing was guaranteed.A reality where one minute, let alone one second, was a waste. Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle was increasingly growing darker, and the students\u2019 safety couldn\u2019t be guaranteed. Now everyone was looking amongst each other for decisions.And that decision-maker also became the person in charge. The weight of her title would stay with her for as long as she was alive. But here, it also meant that everyone in the base would follow her.The realization of this uncertain reality made her dizzy, driving her into a corner.\u201cE-Even so\u2026\u201dEveryone in the camp had their eyes on Princess Penia and Ziggs. It was an urgent situation that carried responsibility for the princess as everyone awaited her decision. A situation where a mistake in her judgment could lead to the loss of another person\u2019s life. A situation where nobody could speak up.And it came back to her\u2026The sound of a burning campfire. The back of a boy who poked the fire with a poker. Looking straight into her eyes without emotion. And those words that penetrated her heart as he left the training center.The distasteful act of crawling on the floor during the entrance examination. His back when he pushed past her to chase after Taylee with an emotionless face. His eyes that never clearly revealed anything.Princess Penia was completely pushed into a corner\u2026 and in that corner she suddenly uttered the words, pointing to the direction of where her sixth sense was leading her.\u201cEven so\u2026 how about\u2026 just once\u2026 let\u2019s just\u2026 believe in that guy\u2026?\u201dSilence filled the air once again.Everyone stayed silent for a long time. Not a single word was said.The expression on their faces showed how absurd they thought it was. As if the sun would rise from the west.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dZiggs lamented.\u201cWhy do you have to say such a cruel thing? The Princess of Benevolence that I know\u2026 she wouldn\u2019t say something so irresponsible!\u201dZiggs only saw her words as a disregard for his worries and opinions.\u201cI will\u2026 be on my way.\u201dZiggs shook his head as he headed towards the exit.\u201cWhere are you going\u2026?!\u201d\u201cLortel.\u201dUnexpectedly, it was Princess Penia who stopped Lortel from chasing after Ziggs. Although she was just in the middle of talking about how absurd trusting Ed was.To be honest, she herself didn't understand why she had said that.\u201cJust let him go.\u201d\u201cPrincess.\u201d\u201cHowever, you need to take responsibility for the outcome, Ziggs.\u201dThere were already too many things to think about. The Princess was at her limit.\u201cI will pay for all my sins when I get back.\u201dFinally getting permission, Ziggs bowed his head politely. He fully understood just how selfish his choice was. Nevertheless, since he had decided to save Elka, then even Princess Penia couldn\u2019t stop him.Ziggs slowly lifted his head and left the base with a stern face.\u201cPrincess Penia.\u201dWatching his back as he slowly walked away, Lortel called out to the princess.She turned her head to find Lortel staring at her in a rather obedient manner.Princess Penia could tell what Lortel was thinking without having to use her Insightful Eyes.Being an excessive realist, she would condemn Princess Penia\u2019s decision. Even if somebody were to get hurt or be harmed, she would tell the princess that she should\u2019ve never let Ziggs leave.The princess steeled her heart.But Lortel actually had a wide smile across her face.\u201cThinking about it, it may have been necessary to respect his opinion.\u201d\u201cLortel.\u201d\u201cIt must have been a decision made by the princess after much consideration. Anyways, he\u2019s always had a noble will, so he couldn\u2019t just blindly judge if something was wrong or right.\u201dLortel spoke so calmly and coolly, as if she didn\u2019t care about the tense situation just a moment ago. And she also affirmed the princess\u2019s decision.\u201cAnyways, if there aren\u2019t any changes in our original plan of entering the Student Center in an hour, we should begin preparing for the subjugation now. I\u2019ll be taking a short break and checking my body\u2019s condition. Princess Penia, I hope you too could get some rest.\u201dAnd with an elegant smile, Lortel Kehelland politely greeted Princess Penia as she walked by.Although the situation didn\u2019t go the way she had thought it would go, the way Lortel stepped down and even encouraged the princess\u2019s decision was that of a model vassal.However, it was very clear to the princess.Behind her heartfelt smile and act of encouragement was a deep feeling of disillusionment.She felt it the moment Lortel passed her by.Her relationship with Lortel wasn\u2019t very good, to begin with, but now she felt that this incident had somehow created a distance that couldn\u2019t be narrowed.Even if the world were to turn upside down, Lortel would never believe in Princess Penia.The princess had a strong feeling about that.\u201cI\u2019ll be taking a break too, Claire.\u201dShe spoke to her loyal escort as she leaned her back against the barricade in a corner. Claire nodded and went on guard with a stern face.And just like that, the tense situation in the camp had ended.They didn\u2019t know where Lazy Lucy was, the strongest person amongst them all.One of the most important combat forces, The Spear from Nature Ziggs, had completely left the base.And the most realistic and rational person, The Golden Daughter Lortel, was now psychologically and completely hostile towards her.Nevertheless, she was the only one who could manage the weight of these students.The princess hid behind the barricade so nobody would see, and held her knees to her chest.Either way, the atmosphere around the base was not that of taking a rest. It wasn\u2019t like a powerful spirit was going to attack them right away. As long as there was someone who kept watch, there was time to check themselves and their equipment.In her corner, where nobody could see, Princess Penia spoke quietly.It was something that a person of royal status should never say for the entirety of their life.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me too.\u201dEven though she was afraid that somebody might hear her by chance, she couldn\u2019t help but let the words slip from her mouth.\u201cReally\u2026 it\u2019s hard for me too\u2026\u201dShe was a girl who had never acted like a child in her life.Though it\u2019s sad, even saying those small words were accompanied by guilt.The time to defeat Yennekar was approaching.Looking up to the sky, Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle, which was dazzling in the night sky, was drastically getting brighter.* * *[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Ordinary MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700 Fast Casting Level 4\u0700 Mana Sense Level 5Fire Element Magic:\u0700 Ignite Level 10Wind Element Magic:\u0700 Wind Blade Level 10Spirit-type Magic:\u0700 Spirit Resonance Level 3\u0700 Spirit Understanding Level 3\u201cGasp, gasp\u2026\u201dCompletely exhausted, I dropped down to the ground, completely exhausted.It had been two hours since Phase 1 started. My proficiency in spirit-type skills rose as I captured and defeated Spirit Stigmatas and Elemental Traces around the library.I wiped off my sweat and felt a sense of satisfaction rose as I looked at my skills window. This would enable me to imbue spirit magic into my arrows. A breakthrough in terms of my combat power.\u201cAhh! But seriously\u2026 This is way too hard.\u201dI had been diligently training but there were still some dangerous moments because of the wind that kept pushing me away.I looked around. It seemed I had already cleared all the spirits wandering around the library. All that\u2019s left were traces of my continuous use of\u00a0Wind Blade, and the burnt debris laying around from using\u00a0Ignite. But if I wait a bit, I knew new spirits would eventually come.\u201cPhew\u2026 I need to get\u00a0Spirit Resonance\u00a0as close to level 10 as possible.

Wasn\u2019t that a known fact to anyone who lifted even just a little bit at the gym?This wasn\u2019t the time to be lazy. I needed to keep pushing myself to the extreme until there wasn\u2019t a single drop of strength left in my body. Surely, doing that much would bring me a significant stat change.Oh, I saw a bunch of new spirits approaching. I got up, filled with renewed fighting spirit. This wasn\u2019t an opportunity that would come by easily. It was time to train and train again until the moment I didn\u2019t have an ounce of energy left.\u201cI can still do more\u2026!

    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (3)The phrase \u2018rags to riches' wasn\u2019t enough to fully explain the miracle that was Zigg\u2019s life.The barbaric grasslands up north were a place that the empire has no rule over. It was a place where one constantly worries about their potential death every day. Ziggs was a descendant of the nomadic people who resided in these lands.By the time he had grown enough, he was already separated from his family. He didn\u2019t know when or why he was abandoned, or if he would ever be capable of reintroducing himself back to the company of others.Rather than learning how to read, Ziggs learned how to cut the throat of a deer. Rather than learning how to purchase things from stores, he learned how to procure supplies from roadside corpses. His life was closer to an animal than to a human being.\u201cZiggs, you\u2019re like a wolf that walks on two feet.\u201dZiggs reflexively nodded his head at Elka\u2019s words the first time they met.The reason why she said that was obvious. The first time they met, Ziggs had a filthy appearance as he dragged an elk\u2019s corpse behind him, his shaggy hair hanging down his face.Elka was the only one who knew how different his current neat and tidy appearance was from how he was before.But the reason why Ziggs nodded then was not just because of his shabby appearance.Their first meeting was but a distant story now. The civilized world moved much faster than Ziggs had expected, so much so that he could no longer remember what his life in the grasslands was like, back when his every day was the same.When Elka\u2019s archaeologist father discovered Ziggs\u2019s talent in magic. When they brought him to their mansion. The first time he had a proper meal of warm soup and bread. When he learned the rules of civilization, step by step. When he first used elemental magic to pull out an old tree in the mansion\u2019s garden. When he got admitted into Silvenia with Elka. And even the day they walked together to the entrance examination.Even these passing memories of his life were becoming a distant past.However, there were some memories that would come to mind whenever he looked up at the sky.\u201cZiggs, you\u2019re like a wolf that walks on two feet.\u201dHe had been living in the vast grasslands. He had eaten the bodies of animals found on the side of the road and had protected himself with the magic he had awakened alone. He had fallen asleep under the moon\u2026He was a baby wolf that had been abandoned by the pack.Ziggs had no choice but to reflexively nod at Elka\u2019s words.Thinking back on it, he had lived a very lonely life.The day he first met Elka, Zigss realized what loneliness was.That was a very old story now.\u201cGasp, gasp\u2026\u201dThe date had already changed. It wasn\u2019t until way past midnight when Ziggs finally arrived at the library.Fluid Spirits and low-ranking spirits were no match for Ziggs, but they were constantly rushing towards him, causing his Vitality to wear down as he ran and used mana to defeat them at the same time.He would\u2019ve arrived much later if he fought Lortel.In this situation, when every second and every minute mattered, he felt grateful to Princess Penia for stopping Lortel.He would have to eventually repay the favor, but paying the price for what he did would have to wait for now.\u201cGasp\u2026 Gasp\u2026 Phew\u2026\u201dContrary to what he expected, it was completely quiet around the library.The annoying spirits that ganged up and attacked him all the way here were nowhere to be found.However, he found traces left behind.\u201cThis, This is\u2026\u201dAnalyzing the situation using traces left in the environment was not uncommon for Ziggs, who had a strong sense of survival.There were traces of magic all around the entrance of the library. The cutting marks all over the floor and benches must have come from\u00a0Wind Blade, and the burnt marks on the empty floor and walls were signs of\u00a0Ignite.Ziggs calmly looked around.It was quiet around the library like usual. It was like nothing has happened despite the disaster that was taking place at the Student Center. The library located on a small hill was still completely in place.The traces of fighting started at the entrance of the library all the way to the outskirts of the district. This wasn\u2019t a simple defensive battle protecting the base, but a sign showing someone had deliberately beaten all the spirits circling around the area.There were even footprints at the exact same spot several times. They seemed to have secured the safety of the library like a guard.Whoever it was had beaten all the spirits around the library.But it didn\u2019t matter who it was who left these traces. Ziggs quickly rushed inside the library to find Elka. Through the large wooden doors was a lobby with an elaborate corridor extending to both sides.And right there in the lobby was a familiar boy, laying with his back against a statue. His name came out of Ziggs\u2019s mouth.\u201cEd Rothstaylor!\u201dA boy who was completely exhausted and was resting. A name that made Ziggs lose all reasoning.Ziggs ran to him like a bullet.\u201cEh? What. You.\u201dResting against a statue, he rose on one knee supported by an elbow.Ed Rothstaylor didn\u2019t look quite normal. His school uniform was torn and worn out. His body was a wreck, and his Vitality had completely depleted.A boy who is completely exhausted and resting. A name that made Ziggs lose all reasoning.He looked like he had been fighting to the extremes. But these were things Ziggs couldn\u2019t afford to pay attention to calmly.\u201cElka! Where\u2019s Elka?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 What are you doing here\u2026?\u201d\u201cTell me where Elka is first!\u201dEd frowned as he looked straight at Ziggs. In any case, he wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate with Ziggs right now, as Ziggs had completely lost his mind.\u201cReading Room 3.\u201dZiggs ran to the reading room even before Ed could finish his answer. He had to secure Elka\u2019s safety right away.He ran like crazy toward the end of the hallway, where a door labeled Reading Room 3 came into view.But it had an unusual entrance. There were bookcases used as a barricade and a blackout curtain was blocking it from view. Though simple, the reading room looked to be fortified.Ziggs removed the curtains hanging from the door, opening it with such force that it broke the sliding door.\u201cElka!\u201dZiggs entered the room yelling her name.And just as he hoped for, Elka was there, safely laying on a desk. She was unconscious, however.\u201cElka! Are you okay? Elka!\u201dZiggs took a deep breath and observed Elka\u2019s conditions.She was breathing peacefully. Looking at her from head to toe, there was not a single scratch, and it didn\u2019t seem like she had been attacked by a spirit.It felt as though black mud was persistently pushing down his throat.\u201cHaaa\u2026!\u201dZiggs collapsed into a chair, his whole body exhausted.Elka Islam was safe.That one fact felt like great salvation for the boy.\u201cThank goodness\u2026 Really\u2026 Thank god.\u201dHe wiped his face for a while, Elka sleeping peacefully in front of him.Five minutes passed by before Ziggs came back to his senses.After his breathing had calmed down, and his Vitality had recovered back to some extent, his rational and logical mind began to return. Having confirmed Elka was safe, he was now able to judge the situation objectively.Ziggs looked around the room.The windows were completely covered by large bookshelves. A rampant spirit looking through the window wouldn\u2019t have been able to see inside, the view completely blocked.And the blackout curtain hanging on the entrance. Since it was a doorway, it wouldn\u2019t have been a good idea to block it with a bookshelf like the windows. In a situation where you would need to run away, a bookshelf would only block your way out. Indeed, the blackout curtains were a good replacement for that.It was a decision that showed a lot of skill and thought. Since there weren\u2019t enough blackout curtains, the door at the back was blocked by another bookshelf, and outside it was a simple wall of defense, in case there were spirits in the hallway.It was set up in a way that any other entrance or exit other than the door nearest to Elka would have been dangerous.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Elka. No matter how urgent the situation is, you were always calm and made the right decisions. Of course, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t already know that.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t trust Elka, rather, he was so worried he couldn\u2019t bear it.However, the more Ziggs thought about it, the more he realized something seemed strange, The reading rooms as barricaded with bookshelves outside. They were so big that even adult men wouldn\u2019t have been able to lift them properly.It was hard to believe Elka did everything by herself. She was born weak, enough to even struggle to lift a hand ax.Then the person who did all of these\u2026By the process of elimination, there was only one person who could have done it.\u201cThat guy\u2026?\u201dCome to think of it, he didn\u2019t realize this at first because he wasn\u2019t in his right mind, but Ed Rothstaylor was lying in the middle of the lobby, looking completely exhausted.Ziggs heard he was an extremely cruel and selfish person, the biggest piece of trash there was, someone who had no problem backstabbing others.But looking at this situation right now\u2026 it was all too strange.The traces of a battle outside, and the simple fortress around the reading room to conceal an unconscious girl. On top of that, Ed\u2019s appearance looked like he dealt with all the spirits approaching the library to protect Elka.The endless onslaught of spirits from the Student Center until here, where a boy was holding his legs together in the lobby, looking worn.It wasn\u2019t difficult for Ziggs to figure it all out.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dAs someone who lived in the wild, it was obvious to Ziggs what the best course of action would have been in this crisis situation.It may sound cold and heartless but in a situation such as this, Elka was nothing more than deadweight.If you wanted to keep your own life and secure your own safety, the rational and logical way would have been to abandon Elka, or use her as bait and run away. Humans had no choice but to feel guilty for such acts, but humans in need also had no choice but to worry about their own survival.Ziggs thought that someone like Ed Rothstaylor would have no problem doing such things without any sense of guilt.That was why Ziggs lost sense of all reasoning and ran all the way here.\u201cThat guy\u2026 There\u2019s no way.\u201dZiggs couldn\u2019t help but repeat the words again.Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s reputation in the academy was already rock bottom. You wouldn\u2019t be able to find anyone who approved of him. Ziggs himself had seen that despicable side of his very clearly.There was no way a single slice of selflessness could be in such a person. That was what Ziggs thought.There is no way that there would be even a single piece of selflessness left in such a person. That\u2019s what he had thought.\u201cDon\u2019t panic when you wake up. And stay right here. Everything should be over before daybreak so you should stay calm and block the entrance. And don\u2019t provoke the spirits. Always think about your own safety first and don\u2019t hastily move about.\u201d\u201c......\u201dOn the other hand, this was written on the blackboard.Judging by the crooked letters, you could tell this was written in a hurry.Even though he was in a hurry and was most likely busy, he brought a blackboard all the way here and set it up, and then wrote this message\u2026 it was easy to figure things out.Ziggs was left with no choice but to sit for a while, staring off into space.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Ordinary MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700\u00a0Fast Casting Level 5\u0700\u00a0Mana Sense Level 6Fire Element Magic:\u0700\u00a0Ignite Level 12Wind Element Magic:\u0700\u00a0Wind Blade Level 11Spirit-type Magic:\u0700\u00a0Spirit Resonance Level 7\u0700\u00a0Spirit Understanding Level 7\u201cEhh, what a shame.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh as I crouched down in the lobby of the library.My beginner magic had finally broken through the wall that was level 10 after training against the spirits til I reached my limit.\u00a0Ignite\u00a0had reached level 12, to the extent that I could now one-shot low-ranking spirits with its fire.It was a good enough foundation to try and start acquiring intermediate magic. I was able to break some ground tonight.Nevertheless, I couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of regret.Spirit Resonance\u00a0and\u00a0Spirit Understanding\u00a0were both at level 7. Just a little bit more\u2026When the sum of the level of these two skills exceeds 15, the field of spirit-type magic would become available and Spirit Contract slots would open up. Then you could form a contract with an appropriate spirit in proportion to your Intelligence stat, your amount of magic power, and your\u00a0Spirit Understanding.My capabilities in combat and production would greatly expand if that were to happen. I would be able to apply various attributes to enchant my arrows using spirit skills. And by raising my production level, I could try and begin crafting basic magic tools with the spirits\u2019 protection.With such a hopeful dream, I fought and trained until I was completely out of energy in my entire body. But I was ultimately blocked at the very end of the threshold.I could no longer see any spirits wandering around the academic district. There were no new spirits coming towards the library either.That clearly meant the Glasskan Subjugation team had already entered the Student Center, marking the start of Phase 2. The main stage for the story would now be the Student Center, where Yennekar was summoning Glasskan.\u201cThis is too cruel. Even though I caught so many\u2026\u201dThe two spirit-type skills had been stuck at level 7 for a while. I kept hoping for one more level, just one more! With that in mind, I defeated and depleted all of my magic until my whole body was completely exhausted. But the experience points I needed at that level had already increased significantly, so both their levels had barely risen.\u201cI guess this is it\u2026 since I\u2019ve only been catching Fluif Spirits and low-ranking spirits.\u201dIf I were to catch a mid-ranking spirit instead, I could probably gain a lot of experience points all at once, and maybe even open up a Spirit Contract slot.But I would need to go to the Student Center to do that, and I would have to push past all the low-ranking spirits just to get there. It might be possible now with how much their numbers have dwindled since Phase 2 started, but my body was in too bad a shape to even attempt it.And not only that, but all the important characters of the main story would be there. And nothing good would come out of hanging around a place where the all-star cast of the first-years was gathered.I had no choice but to just wait for the next chance. Although disappointed, I called it quits and promised myself to do it another time.Main story.After ignoring it for a while, a question came to mind the minute it came up again.\u201cWhat is Ziggs doing here?\u201dI let him in since he was in a hurry, but now that I thought about it, Ziggs was a key member of the subjugation team.An ominous feeling dawned on me. At that moment, I realized I needed to reorganize this whole situation.Stomp. Stomp.I heard footsteps coming from Reading Room 3.Sure enough, I looked and Ziggs was slowly making his way down the lobby with Elka on his back.He stopped right in front of me and slowly asked.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201c.....\u201dI couldn\u2019t read any emotion in his voice. It must have been hard for him to completely ignore me when he saw I was resting and wounded.\u201cI asked what are you doing here.\u201dThis was a question I didn\u2019t need to lie to answer.\u201c\u2026training.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dZiggs laughed for a bit.\u201cHaha! That\u2019s quite some training.\u201dI didn\u2019t expect him to laugh. Ziggs continued to talk in a less serious voice than I had expected.\u201cThis is a crisis situation. We don\u2019t know what will happen next. There\u2019s a barrier all across the sky and spirits won't stop attacking us\u2026 and yet you were here training all by yourself? When you should be worrying about your life?\u201dAnd with that, Ziggs stopped smiling.\u201cNo matter how naive a person is, who would believe that.\u201d\u201c......\u201d\u201cOkay, I feel like I\u2019m beginning to understand you a bit as a human being. You\u2019re this kind of person in the first place, anyway.\u201dA stretch of silence engulfed us.Ziggs looked at me with a serious look on his face, and then after a while, he closed his eyes and got lost in his own thoughts.After standing still for a long time, what Ziggs did next was completely unexpected.With Elka still on his back, Ziggs bowed his head and bent all the way to his waist.\u201cI really owe you a great favor, Ed.\u201dZiggs suddenly speaking to him with respect was surprising enough, but the unexpected action made it even more difficult to figure out what would happen next.TN: Till now, Ziggs has been speaking casually to Ed.\u201cI will definitely repay this debt when the opportunity arises.\u201dIt was at this moment that I finally figured out what was going on. That girl Elka on Ziggs\u2019s back was definitely\u2026 his lover, or would be his lover, someone who had been with him since their childhood.I couldn\u2019t help but think about it. Zigg\u2019s past was not given much importance in the game. The name Elka was only mentioned in a supplementary book, so it was an unknown name for even the most dedicated of fans.\u201cThen hurry and go back to the Student Center.\u201dThe words came out on their own.Ziggs, who still has his head down, looked as if he had been stabbed in the lungs.\u201cDidn\u2019t you abandon the Student Center and run all the way here to save Elka?\u201dFortunately, he didn\u2019t ask me how I knew all of that. Ziggs was in shock and didn\u2019t have time to argue about such things.\u201cI\u2019m not going to scold you for making such a selfish decision. But now that you\u2019ve confirmed Elka is safe, you should go and hurry up and do what you have to do.\u201dThere was no need for me to say much.Ziggs was one of the most talented first-year students in Silvenia. Ziggs participation would determine the victory or defeat of the subjugation force. There was no need to worry if the main story was progressing the way it should, because if Ziggs was here right now, then the subjugation force itself won\u2019t get established in the first place.They may be able to go past Phase 2, but Phase 3 with the high-ranking fire spirit Takan was a different matterThe only way to break through Takan was with Ziggs.The main character Taylee would knock off some of Takan\u2019s scales, and then cut his tail off using the\u00a0Elemental Slash\u00a0skill. Then Ziggs, who had excellent battle sense and agility, would climb on top of Takan\u2019s body and directly inflict magic damage on its torn flesh.Takan would scream in pain from this. Meanwhile, Ziggs would make a hole in its neck, and Taylee would jump down from the ceiling to cut it off again.In order for this battle to happen, Ziggs needed to be there.\u201cGo and give Taylee a hand. Just do whatever he wants. Some way or another, everything will work out just fine.\u201d\u201cTaylee\u2026 Do you mean Taylee McLaure?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That guy who barely escapes failing every single day.\u201dAlthough, Taylee shouldn\u2019t be that weak nowadays, given that it\u2019s already the Act 1 finale. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d been training to increase his stats. Plus, he had already gone through various events at this point. He must have already gotten some sort of special skill or abilities.If he had been fostering his skills with optimal efficiency and not wasting an inch, he should be able to use intermediate magic. Although, I didn\u2019t think he would\u2019ve gotten that far by now.I was sure Taylee\u2019s efforts in raising the level of his skills were not up to my satisfaction. But he should still be trying his best\u2026 This episode was when he would receive a swordmaster skill, which meant that he would be able to take care of things by himself soon enough.Ziggs made a weird face.\u201cEd, don\u2019t you hate Taylee?\u201dShit!Since Ziggs saw the incident at the entrance exam, he would\u2019ve definitely felt something was off from my words.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be arguing about what\u2019s right and wrong.\u201dI waved my hand, dismissing the topic away.Either way, he was still an important character in the main story, so I didn\u2019t need to give him more information, nor should I get too close.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see why people value Taylee so highly\u2026 I never had the chance to talk with him properly yet\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not over-evaluating him. A particular example would be the high-ranking fire spirit Takan. You won\u2019t be able to deal damage to it unless Taylee uses\u00a0Elemental Slash. It\u2019s not about the destructive power, it's about the compatibility of the skills in a given situation.\u201dSince it had already come to this, giving this much of a tip should be fine.\u201cListen carefully. Don\u2019t go trying to break through Takan\u2019s scales with magic. Wait until Taylee cuts through the scales with his\u00a0Elemental Slash. I don\u2019t think there is anyone on the subjugation force with enough pure firepower to break through Takan\u2019s scales. So don\u2019t go around wasting your magic power trying to. Stay calm and wait for the right moment.\u201dThe key to this battle was to attack the part of Takan\u2019s scale that had been exposed by\u00a0Elemental Slash.I didn\u2019t really want to give too much away, but I figured I might as well tell him this for insurance. The moment Ziggs appeared at the library, the original timeline had already been messed up anyway. I thought it was only reasonable to take some backup measures such as this. Just in case.\u201c...I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dZiggs seemed like he still had a lot of things to stay, but he held them in and merely accepted everything I had said.It seemed he may have realized it too. That the summoning circle for Glasskan in the sky kept getting darker and darker. We didn\u2019t have much time left.\u201cThere is a temporary base that the first-year students had built in the Student Square. I\u2019ll escort you there.\u201d\u201cForget it. Go by yourself. There\u2019s not much time left so hurry up and get moving. I\u2019m going to just rest here.\u201d\u201cEd, you never know when the spirits might come over here again.\u201dPhase 1 had already ended. The library should be safe from this point onwards. But Ziggs didn\u2019t know that and was worried for me.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just go. I\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d\u201c......\u201d\u201cThe most important thing right now is for you to get back to the Student Center. You know that too.\u201dEven though he already knew that, Ziggs had already left everything behind just to come here. My words seemed to have hit a sore spot as a shadow passed over Ziggs\u2019s face.\u201cWhether you may be feeling guilt or shame, worry about that after all of this, okay?\u201dWith that, I was able to clearly deliver my message to Ziggs.Ziggs closed his eyes for a second to weigh in the pros and cons before nodding his with a tern expression. He fixed Elka on his back when he very clearly said.\u201cThank you for the advice.\u201dAnd just like that, Ziggs headed towards the entrance of the library.I let out a sigh as I leaned my back against the statue, watching Ziggs walk away.Ugh, what a headache.Anyways, this should be the end of that. As long as Ziggs returned back to the Student Center before Phase 3, in one way or another, things should work out fine...\u201cHold on a second\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, I thought of something that made me feel a weird sense of anxiety envelop my chest.A weird echoing of words was going through my head as I stared at Zigg\u2019s back as he walked away.I remembered the countless times I played \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordsmaster\u2019. I understood the basics, did my best to control the variables, and made sure that there were no harmful influences that would affect the main story.And yet\u2026 I still kept feeling the strange claw of anxiety in my chest. I had no idea where it could be from.No, if I really thought about it. It was\u2026\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see why people value Taylee so highly\u2026 I never had the chance to talk with him properly yet\u2026\u201dIt was because of something Ziggs said.From what I remembered, Ziggs was a supportive character that recognized and helped the main character Taylee. Whether it was a crisis or whenever deemed necessary, Ziggs would work together with Taylee, thus, creating a closer bond between them.To put it simply, he was a character designated to be the main character\u2019s friend. A \u2018reliable colleague\u2019 or a \u2018friend\u2019.So it was strange he didn\u2019t have much appreciation for Taylee. Wasn\u2019t Act 1 already about to end? Maybe, there wasn\u2019t enough time for them to build a proper bond just yet.But even then, Ziggs was talking about Taylee as if he had never even met him before\u2026 that was definitely strange.I went through my memory and wracked my brain for when Taylee and Ziggs became friends for the first time. It was\u2026\u2018Act 1 Chapter 9: End of Semester Evaluation.\u2019It was the first time Ziggs and Taylee fought each other in a duel. The story followed their battle and how Ziggs started to recognize Taylee, the boy continuing to grow each every moment of the battle.But after thinking that far, all kinds of possibilities unfolded in my head.Suddenly, a chill ran down my spine.\u201cHey, Ziggs.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI called to him as he made his way out.\u201cI changed my mind. I should go to the Student Center too.\u201dIt was a place where all the main characters would be gathering. There was no reason for me to go, originally.But unfortunately\u2026 everything had just collapsed.The finale of Act 1, Glasskan\u2019s Subjugation, was currently underway.However, I didn\u2019t know why but, the finale happened last night instead of at the end of the semester. It had moved a whole month forward.There was no way to know why Yennekar\u2019s actions had been accelerated so soon, or what type of variables came into play here. I wasn\u2019t sure if we would ever find out the in future either. But right now, every move Yennekar Palerover would make was like an empty piece of the puzzle.But there was one fact that I became certain of.Because Glasskan\u2019s Subjugation happened earlier than scheduled, \u2018Act 1 Chapter 9: End of Semester Evaluation\u2019 hadn\u2019t happened yet.And what did that mean?A phrase from a strategy guide I read a long time suddenly came to mind.\u25a0 Phase 3: The Battle at Nail Hall\u2019s CorridorAchievement Condition:Get to the Combat Practice Field where Elementalist Yennekar is waitingAppearing Enemies:High-Ranking Fire Spirit Takan x1\u203b The entrance will be different depending on what you chose after defeating Altair. The turning point will pass by quickly so make sure to pay attention.\u203b The key to defeating Takan is to continuously damage its tail using your\u00a0Elemental Slash,\u00a0which you should\u2019ve learned from Act 1 Chapter 9. After you cut off the tail using\u00a0Elemental Slash, use it again to attack the head.At this point in time, when Act 1 Chapter 9 still hadn\u2019t happened, Taylee didn\u2019t have\u00a0Elemental Slash\u00a0just yet\u2026But what this meant was that right now, Taylee couldn\u2019t beat Takan.Needless to say, it meant the collapse of all the major premises of the story.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (4)\u201cSomeday, by all means, please save Yennekar.\u201dI suddenly remembered the high-ranking wind spirit Merilda\u2019s message.I couldn\u2019t help but want to ask follow-up questions at such a request.How did it know what was gonna happen to Yennekar? It probably didn't have information of how the story would progress like I did.And what did it want me to do by asking me to save her?Did it expect me to just run to the Student Center and defeat Velosper? To go sacrifice myself and throw away my insider information about the future? How did it even think I could defeat Velosper?Or did it want me to read Yennekar's thoughts so I could prevent her from doing this? Like some mad god obsessed with controlling the variables to make it possible for Yennekar to live a happy life? There were certain degrees to how unreasonable demands could be.But Merilda wasn't an idiot.The one who delivered the message was Lucy Mayreel. Merilda kept track of every single move I made in the forest. This meant she took that into consideration before giving me the message. There must have been a reason for it.Trying to figure out her intention wasn't easy, nor was it important, right now.I already had so many things I needed to take care of. I didn't have the headspace to even think about some side problem.* * *The world was already filled with difficult challenges, so I found no reason why I should even challenge the impossible.The reason people had a hard time challenging the impossible was that they didn't even know it was impossible in the first place.From the point of view of someone who had already cleared \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 countless of times, who had measured all the skills of both characters and enemies, who had played through the game in various playstyles\u2014trying to beat Takan right now would be challenging the impossible.\u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 Act 1 Finale. The 3rd named boss. The high-ranking fire spirit Takan.Takan was already a high-ranking spirit with overwhelming specs, but with Velosper\u2019s\u00a0Berserk\u00a0buff, it now had an infinite advantage against magic. The hard scales that wrapped around its entire body nullified the power of any magic attack. The fact that a sword could even penetrate it already didn\u2019t make any sense.Anyone who had ever played a game would figure it out at this point. Takan wasn\u2019t a boss made to be defeated through skills and strategies.He was an event boss. A boss added by the story to have Taylee use his newly acquired\u00a0Elemental Slash\u00a0from the last chapter.Whenever a new skill, function, element, or anything else was introduced in a game such as this, the natural progression would be to make players learn how to use it. It would be ridiculous if they just kept adding skills but never introduced the players to how to properly wield them.As a result, this became a situation wherein I had to open a locked door without the key.That was impossible, obviously.\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. It\u2019s not necessary but it\u2019s good to have, just in case.\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 that so?\u201dZiggs asked me about the leather bag I brought out from the reading room. But there was no time to explain so I had held the bag in my arms as I crossed the hallway.Since I needed to make the impossible possible, my methods didn\u2019t have to be normal. If I couldn\u2019t open a locked door, then I just had to go through the back door.The story that was progressing smoothly somehow got derailed. I needed to put my stance of safely watching from the sidelines on hold. I had to flip it back to its original state. I needed to quickly adapt to the unfolding situation.I would have been able to solve this in a simpler way had I had enough time. Since I knew every single factor within the game, I would\u2019ve been able to plan more accordingly to my benefit.But I could only afford to deal with what i already had. And my method boiled down to my insider information, a privilege I alone enjoyed.Luckily, I came up with a good idea.Though the idea was ridiculous, it was the surest idea that would work out.* * *\u201cI'm sorry for being late. I will pay for the crime I had committed.\u201d\u201cNever mind that. Even if you were here, we would have lost anyway.\u201dThe time to face the subjugation force came earlier than I had expected.Ziggs dropped Elka off at the Student Square since he couldn\u2019t enter the Student Center with her on his back. We ran all the way here with all our strength since it was an urgent situation. But surprisingly, the subjugation team had already returned to the Square.And their condition was ridiculous.\u201cWe were lucky enough to retreat but\u2026\u201dPrincess Penia looked up at the vast night sky. Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle had almost completely turned dark red. It wouldn\u2019t even be strange if it were to be completed right now.The barrier covering the academic district was still intact, so it seemed moot to expect help from outside.\u201cHaving come all the way here, this is a situation where I have to enter headfirst and either sink or swim.\u201dTime wasn\u2019t on our side. Nobody would suggest waiting for outside help at this point, given how the summoning circle had filled the sky with red. But even if they were running out of time, the subjugation team already lost once and had wasted precious time from retreating.I looked around. How far did they enter? Where did they get stuck? And how much damage did they take?I was awe-struck by all the students gathered around me. All of these main characters who had individual roles were gathered together in one place like some sort of glorious event.The Failed Swordmaster Taylee, Companion Ayla, The Benevolent Princess Penia, The Golden Daughter Lortel, The Spear from Nature Ziggs, Head Escort Claire, Gloomy Clevius, Nosy Elvira\u2026They all had injuries of varying severity, big and small. Head Escort Claire, particularly, had one of her legs completely burned. She was now useless in terms of fighting power.Not only that, but Clevius was also wearing a split on one of his arms. It looked like a fracture. That meant he too had lost a great deal of value as part of the team\u2019s fighting power.But the most important thing was that Taylee looked okay. Considering that fact, I started to decide what steps we needed to take to keep the story progressing.Claire voiced her opinion, barely managing to keep her balance.\u201cIf you\u2019re planning on re-entering, I think it would be a good idea to gather volunteers from the regular students and then re-enter. Once the pain goes away, I will also hurry up and\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Claire. You will rest here.\u201dClaire shook her head.\u201cPrincess Penia, if you are really being considerate towards me, then please withdraw your command.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even walk properly, Claire. I too\u2026 have a heart.\u201dYou could infer from the princess\u2019s tone that the reason such a talented royal knight such as Claire was even seriously injured was that she had protected Princess Penia.The princess talked in a firm voice, keeping her resolve, but she must be a wreck inside.It was definitely like her to not show any weakness. However, just being strong-minded didn\u2019t mean the current crisis at hand would be solved. It wasn\u2019t a strong heart that would solve this crisis, but one\u2019s abilities.I looked around our surroundings.Surrounding the Square were Neres Hall, Obell Hall, and the Student Center.Of the buildings, Glockt Hall was completely destroyed, a result of entering the building to fight a mid-ranking spirit during Phase 2. The entrance to Nail Hall was also open, probably from when they defeated the spiritual beast Altair who was blocking it.Just as I expected. They got through Phase 2 but lost to Takan during Phase 3.Thankfully, they were able to retreat successfully. Although they ended up wasting too much precious time and even lost Claire, who was an important part of the team in terms of fighting power. The top first-year student of the Combat Department, Clevius, had also lost more than half of his fighting power.We didn\u2019t have much time and we were out of fighting power. It also seemed like the summoning circle would get completed anytime now before any sort of outside help could come. I couldn\u2019t just stay still but I also was not sure if we would be able to win if we were to re-enter right away.Princes Penia tightly clenched her teeth. She was in the position to lead the camp. She had to come up with some type of plan.\u201cLet\u2019s divide the subjugation team into two.\u201dI spoke the minute I was able to properly assess the situation.An outsider had intervened all of a sudden. The gloomy atmosphere due to the first-year aces getting hurt became even worse at my intrusion.\u201cLooking at the summoning circle, it seems like it\u2019s going to be completed soon. There\u2019s not enough time to defeat Takan.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2013 Ed Rothstaylor?\u201dGloomy Clevius said as he winced in pain from his fracture.\u201cListen here, does this situation seem like a joke to yo\u2013\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear him out first, Clevius.\u201dZiggs stopped Clevius before he could finish what he was saying.Everyone\u2019s eyes widened at the sight. They looked baffled. Something told me Zigg\u2019s attitude before he left and his attitude towards me now were vastly different. They must be thinking something happened at the library.But no matter what may have happened, I didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to such things right now.\u201cTakan relies on its hearing more than its sight when grasping the surrounding terrain and enemy\u2019s location. So making a loud noise should be enough to lure him away. It will be better if we have one team distract Takan while the other enters the Combat Practice Field.\u201d\u201cEd, you can only say that because you\u2019ve never fought Takan.\u201dIt was Lortel who responded. She had fought Takan one-on-one during the Joint Combat Practice class a while ago.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as when I fought it in class.\u201d\u201cI know. Velosper must have cast\u00a0Berserk. Fighting low-ranking spirits was enough for me to realize that.\u201d\u201cAttract his attention and earn time. That plan doesn\u2019t sit well with me. It was already a relief not to fall down or lose your life with each of its attacks. The only reason we were able to retreat was because we got lucky.\u201dLortel calmly explained.\u201cDid you escape when the pillar fell down?\u201d\u201c......\u201dHow did you know that?They all looked at me with the same questions in their eyes. But there wasn\u2019t enough time to explain.I wasn\u2019t comfortable intervening in the first place. I wouldn\u2019t have needed to explain anything if only there wasn\u2019t an unexpected variable that happened.I had decided not to do anything that would ruin the flow of the original story so as not to risk the knowledge I had.But I needed to put that aside for now.\u203b There are three cutscenes mid-battle where the pillars around the corridor will collapse. You will instantly die if a pillar falls on you so be sure to watch out for it!It wouldn\u2019t have been this hard if we had\u00a0Elemental Slash. But that was something you\u2019d only know if you had enough experience playing the game.If you led Takan under the large stone pillars found at three corners of the corridor, you would be able to time it and had them fall on him, giving the players a bit of time.\u201cYou were lucky.\u201dThey were lucky enough to have one of the pillars fall on Takan, giving them enough time to escape. It was like the heavens had truly helped them.Although that would only happen the first time, because Takan would cut the pillar with its tail after, meaning you couldn\u2019t bank on such luck twice.\u201cI won\u2019t press you for the details, but what you\u2019re suggesting is completely unrealistic, Ed. Takan was an opponent we couldn\u2019t do anything against, even when we all rushed him. So why would we split our fighting power into two? We may be able to buy a little bit of time, yes. But I don\u2019t think that small amount of time would mean anything in the long run.\u201dWhat Lortel said was realistic and reasonable. Her impressive level-headed reasoning was the biggest reason she got to where was today.The half who would be in charge of Takan would most likely get wiped out before they could even buy us some time. And if Takan joins Velosper at the field, that would just be the worst possible situation for us, taking care of the both of them at the same time.\u201dTo summarize the entire reason for her object, it was:\u201cThe risk is too high.\u201dBut that was not something I could say, knowing what I know.\u201cThe risk posed by an action can only be determined if there is another alternative path, Lortel.\u201dLortel momentarily shut her mount, unable to refute my words. She rolled her eyes, thinking of what else she could argue with, but she couldn\u2019t come up with an alternative path to deal with this situation.\u201cPrincess Penia, we shouldn\u2019t forget the most important goal we have right now. And that\u2019s to stop Yennekar who is currently possessed by Velopser.\u201dEveryone fell silent. Nobody wanted to agree with me even though everything I said was true.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to defeat Takan. We can just run past him and find a way to stop Yennekar in the practice field. With this group of people here, we should be able to defeat Velopser. No\u2026 not should. We have to defeat Velosper.\u201dWith all these main characters gathered here today, if we still couldn\u2019t beat Velosper, then it could only be attributed to a lack of synergy.This subjugation team could definitely beat Velosper and Yennekar during the final phase, even if they were lacking in fighting power. The key was Taylee\u2019s\u00a0Swordmaster\u00a0skill. Things would work out if enough people supported him during the battle.\u201cEd Rothstaylor.\u201dPrincess Penia was staring right at me, looking worse for wear.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *So many things and different variables must have pushed her into a corner.The hem of her dress, which had always been shiny, was now dirty and torn here and there. The tips of her silky hair had also been burned by Takan\u2019s flames. All traces of a gruesome battle.With her mind and body pushed into a corner, she looked straight at me.\u201cYou\u2026 It\u2019s you again.\u201d\u201cSince we don\u2019t have much time, I won\u2019t say much.\u201dThe students around us began to whisper.Who is he to talk to the princess so condescendingly?Isn\u2019t it crazy to follow Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s plan?Won\u2019t we all die at this point?Well, these were things not even worth reacting to.\u201cI am not lying.\u201dBut these students were not the ones who would make the final decision. Only one person in this base had a monarch\u2019s qualifications to take on such responsibilities.Princess Penia stared at me for a while\u2026 she seemed to be lost in her thoughts, but soon nodded her head.\u201cWhatever your intent may be, you didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true.\u201dA judgment made calmly.\u201cPrincess Penia! Are you taking his side?! That guy is Ed Rothstaylor!\u201d\u201cQuiet, Claire. I am not taking Ed Rothsaylor\u2019s side, I\u2019m just following the \u2018reasonable opinion\u2019 that he had brought up.\u201dPrincess Penia told the subjugation team after making her final decision.\u201cWe can\u2019t beat Takan right now. But what\u2019s certain is that if we defeat the Elementalist Yennekar, then Takan would also be defeated. But there\u2019s something we must first decide.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s going to stop Takan?\u201dZiggs said. Followed by a moment of silence from everyone.\u201cAh\u2026 isn\u2019t that just picking a person who wants to commit suicide.\u201d\u201cWatch what you say, Elvira.\u201d\u201cOh my, I apologize, princess.\u201dIn a state of disarray, Nosy Elvira quickly shut her mouth.\u201cOne is not specifically safer than the other. The opponent will either be a high-ranking dark spirit or a high-ranking fire spirit.\u201dThat\u2019s right.From their point of view, one was not safer than the other.But from my point of view of knowing everything, dealing with Takan was much more dangerous.Takan was an enemy designed to teach Taylee how to use Elemental Slash. That\u2019s why it was an overwhelmingly overpowered enemy.On the other hand, the high-ranking dark spirit Velosper was just a strong enemy.Defeating him would not rely on a specific attack method like Takan. Velosper was just a standard final boss you could defeat through strategy and properly using your abilities.Takan\u2019s existence is completely unreasonable, given the circumstances. A lock that needed to be opened without a key.But Velosper was just a complicated labyrinth. And with these many talented members, they could surely defeat him through pure effort.\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to deal with that fire-lizard!\u201dThe cowardly Clevius groaned.\u201cI will\u2026 I\u2019ll go with the team fighting Velosper! I\u2019d rather go that way! You even said it yourself, that it was more important to deal with Yennekar!\u201dAh, that\u2019s right. Right now, the biggest difference between the two high-ranking spirits was the fear that the subjugation team had felt.Tension spread throughout the group. The princess wasn\u2019t able to stop Clevius from saying such discouraging things.The enemy they hadn\u2019t met yet, versus the enemy they already lost against.It was obvious that the fear they felt for Takan was much stronger.Takan, the high-ranking spirit made even stronger by Velosper\u2019s\u00a0Berserk\u00a0buff. The embodiment of fear, who swung its tail around, letting out a mighty roar, knocking down the pillars in the corridor while it spewed out flames.It was only natural they didn\u2019t want to deal with it again.Nobody volunteered for the Takan subjugation team.There was tension among the students. Somebody had to take responsibility.\u201cI will take the position.\u201dThe first person to raise their hand was Taylee McLaure.\u201cDon\u2019t say something stupid.\u201dI shut down Taylee immediately.\u201cWhat did you say\u2026?\u201dThere was still hostility in his eyes whenever he would look at me. That much was expected.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that lizard even if you die and get reborn. You wouldn\u2019t even last a minute.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee someone else would be able to do it either. If we had to pick someone to sacrifice, it\u2019s only logical for that sacrifice to be me.\u201dTaylee looked around. All of the faces he saw were of the ace students of the first-year students. It wasn\u2019t everyday you would get to see these people gathered in one place, sharing their opinions.There was only one student here who was at risk of failing. Who was like a goose stuck amongst swans.I was sure he was well-trained now. But that alone wouldn\u2019t nearly be enough to deal with the overwhelming gap between Takan and himself.\u201cI\u2019m quick. I\u2019m not sure how long I could run away for, but if we needed a sacrifice, it\u2019s only right for me to do it.\u201d\u201cYou must have misunderstood. We aren\u2019t here to pick a sacrifice right now.\u201dI grabbed Taylee\u2019s shoulders and turned him around. I gave him a strong push toward the crowd at the base.\u201cStop making a fuss and get over there. You must be in the team who will deal with Velosper.\u201dI looked at Princess Penia after.\u201cI have an idea. I can keep Takan busy until the main force is able to take down Yennekar.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Is there even time to explain right now? It\u2019s a very long plan, so to speak.\u201dThe color of Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle up in the sky would no longer change. It was now completely dark red. It felt like the disaster that was Glasskan would come out any moment now.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to divide the subjugation force into two equal numbers. I just need two people. One to act as the vanguard, and another for firepower.\u201dThat was all I would say. I then closed my mouth.\u201cW-What? You want us to come with you, Ed Rothstaylor, to go take on Takan?! Who in their right mind would do that?! We might as well just pray to god! Rather than trusting and following you\u2026 it would be better to run away towards the barrier\u2019s outskirts!\u201d\u201cThe person in charge of the vanguard will be Clevius, who currently keeps on yapping about.\u201d\u201cWHAT? WHY?! WHY ME?! WHY?! I\u2019M SORRY!!! IT\u2019S MY FAULT! I DON\u2019T WANT TO DIE!\u201d\u201cDear god\u2026 you\u2019re so loud! Idiotic Clevius.\u201dNosy Elvira yelled as she grabbed a piece of cloth used to seal alchemy chemicals and shoved it into the injured Clevius\u2019s mouth, unable to deal with him anymore.Clevius started groaning through the gag while screaming on and off.\u201cAs for the person in charge of firepower\u2026 Lortel, you will come with me.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dThe Golden Daughter Lortel looked at me in surprise.\u201cAs you already know, I suffered a crushing defeat against Takan before, even without the\u00a0Berserk\u00a0magic.\u201d\u201cIs that even important? Is there even anyone here who can beat Takan one-on-one?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true but uhm\u2026\u201dLortel smiled.\u201cI also know how precious my life is. In this situation, regardless of who you ask, isn\u2019t it only natural to politely refuse? Even though I\u2019m not like that idiotic Clevius?\u201d\u2018Who are you calling an idiot?\u2019I could almost hear Clevius cry through the cloth, but none of the other subjugation force members cared.\u201cAlright. But your opinion doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\u201cThat's true too.\u201dLortel cooly admitted. There was only one person who could decide every action and policy regarding the subjugation force.I turned my head towards her. The girl who had the power to decide everyone\u2019s actions, The Benevolent Princess Penia Elias Kroel.\u201cPlease make a decision.\u201d\u201cWill you trust him?\u201d\u201cIs there any alternative?\u201dEveryone nearby had their attention focused on the princess. The students guarding the base looked rather skeptical. You would be living under a rock to not know Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s notoriety. I wasn\u2019t hoping for a favorable response.\u201cPrincess! You can\u2019t! No! You must never! You can\u2019t just trust that guy to take care of things!\u201dGloomy Clevius spat out the fabric in his mouth and shouted in objection.\u201cI think it\u2019s a worthwhile plan. If there are no other alternatives, let\u2019s go with the plan Ed suggested. Because that is the only option we have.\u201dThe Spear from Nature Ziggs was relatively in favor of me.\u201cYeah, It might be better to follow his plan. I\u2019m not sure about anything but I sure know it\u2019s better than doing nothing and getting killed, ahahah!\u201dNosy Elvira seemed to agree with me, but you could tell she was actually in favor of anything.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201dThe Golden Daughter Lortel quietly watched the situation unfold.\u201c......\u201dTaylee stayed silent, his thoughts must have been quite complicated.At the center was Princess Penia with her eyes closed, silent herself.Trying to figure out the correct decision among the many differing opinions.The princess had to carefully choose whose opinions to trust, and whose opinions to discard.After contemplating for a while, Princess Penia opened her and said.\u201cThere is one condition. It may be a bit hard to fulfill.\u201dWithout further complications, the plan seemed to be going into action.\u201cPlease don\u2019t die. You can\u2019t.\u201d* * *The subjugation force was divided into two groups.The team in charge of Takan consisted of me, Clevius, and Lortel.And the team in charge of defeating Yennekar consisted of the remaining members.I didn\u2019t have any big reason why I chose Clevius and Lortel. I just needed two people to be in charge of the vanguard and firepower position.The people who could\u2019ve served as the vanguard were Taylee, Clevius, Ziggs and Claire.Taylee was out of the question and Claire was seriously injured. So it was either Ziggs or Clevius. But it was better to put the stronger Ziggs on the team in charge of defeating Yennekar, as his role was more crucial in the subjugation.I just needed a vanguard who would attract attention, so I didn\u2019t really need someone who was strong. That was why I ended up choosing Clevius who was already injured.As for firepower, Princess Penia, Lortel and Elvira were my potential choices to be in charge of firepower. Ayla was still a bit too weak to be considered for the role.Princess Penia was out of the question. She would be in charge of creating the defense to block Velosper\u2019s magic attacks during the final battle. That\u2019s why she needed to be part of that team.The left Elvira and Lortel. There wasn\u2019t much of a reason for choosing Lortel over Elvira. Lortel was known as the Bad Ending Maker during Act 1 so I didn\u2019t want to put her next to Taylee. That\u2019s why I decided to take her with me instead.As a result, the group in charge of defeating Yennekar was Taylee, Princess Penia, Ziggs, Elvira, and Ayla.The group was a lot smaller compared to the original story. But they could definitely win as long as Taylee would obtain the\u00a0Swordsmaster\u00a0skill.\u201cWe\u2019re cutting it quite close\u2026\u201dThere was nothing to be worried about. I already considered everyone\u2019s stats and who would be the best member for each role, essentially creating the most optimal teams but\u2026 compared to how the story originally went, there were definitely more things to beThere was nothing to be worried about. At this point I have considered all the stats of each member, thought about who would be the best member for each role, and ultimately created the most optimal teams but\u2026 compared to the original timeline, there were definitely many more things to be nervous about.If they couldn\u2019t defeat Yennekar, then things would only get more complicated from there on out. But I had no choice but to trust them for now.What\u2019s more urgent right now was Takan.\u201cThings ended up turning out just like you wanted, Ed.\u201dIt was late into the night. Sunrise was slowly approaching. The time limit was almost up.The location we were headed to was the entrance to the Student Center. On either side of it were Neres Hall and Obel Hall.\u201cShit! Just why did I have to be here?! Dear God! Please spare my life!\u201dClevius was on the verge of tears. Even though he was acting like this, he\u2019s someone who always managed to do the things he needed to do. Even though he was irritatingly screeching like some mosquito next to my ear, he should be quite amazing at being the bait.The three of us stood side by side as we looked at the open entrance to Nail Hall. As soon as we enter the corridor, the battle would start right away.When we had managed to drag Takan out, the group in charge of defeating Yennekar would be able to sneak in behind and enter the Combat Practice Field where the final battle would start.I couldn\u2019t believe the battle against both Takan and Velosper would be happening at the same time. I was experiencing all sorts of weird things, getting myself caught up in all of this.\u201cIt\u2019s about time you tell us, right? How are we going to buy time against that fire-lizard?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201dLortel looked at me with an absurd expression on her face. Even Clevius was completely caught off guard.\u201cWhat? What the hell are you saying?!\u201d\u201cWe will die if Takan\u2019s fire so much as grazes us. Takan is also ridiculously fast, and we will be in a confined space, the pillars had already fallen down\u2026 how could we possibly buy some time? Even if we try to run away, we wouldn\u2019t be able to drag it on for more than five minutes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 those are words we can\u2019t just easily overlook, Ed. We\u2019re risking our lives here.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, I think we can have around five minutes, at the very least.\u201dI took my dirty school uniform coat off and pulled up my sleeves.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think of this as running away. You have to think of this as defeating it.\u201dClevius and Lortel looked dumbfounded at my words. It was a natural reaction for Clevius, but I had never seen Lortel look so puzzled before. She always looked so level-headed. It wasn\u2019t a common sight. Seeing it in person was kinda hilarious.\u201cJust do what I tell you. As long as we follow my plan, we will definitely win.\u201dI waved my arm around, signaling the team in charge of defeating Yennekar.It was to signal that it was time to enter.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (5)Takan\u2019s roar traveled all throughout the vast corridor of Nail Hall.The sound was sharp like a knife, enough to cut through one\u2019s eardrums and make everyone swallow their saliva dry.The vanguard leading the way into battle inside the corridor was Gloomy Clevius.\u201cWhatever! I don\u2019t care! This is the end of my life!\u201dHe was the top student among the first-years of the Combat Department.Clevius was prone to saying ominous things and was always complaining. Coupled with his gloomy appearance, one couldn\u2019t help but think of him as someone who\u2019s rather pathetic. However, he was actually pretty resilient in a crisis.Even with how cowardly he tended to act, he was still able to take the top spot in the Combat Department\u2019s first-year students. Although, strangely, he was unsure of his own skills. Maybe it was due to his past, maybe an unfortunate family upbringing or history, but whatever the case, it wasn\u2019t what was important right now.What was important was that he was able to withstand attacks at a level that anyone would be in shock of.\u201cWaaaaaaaah!\u201dHe had one of his arms in a splint due to a fracture, but Clevius was running across the corridor of Nail Hall as if it was nothing.Nail Hall was one of the three buildings in the Student Center. It was used as a venue for various assemblies and was also often used as a training field. It was properly managed as it was a building where crowds of people would come and go all year round. To prove this fact, not a speck of dust could be seen on the marble floor of the whole corridor which stretched all the way out.At the end of the corridor, about fifty meters ahead, was a large door that led to the Combat Training Field. It was where the first-years and second-years held their Joint Combat Training class every year. That majestic door that would normally welcome any student in Silvenia was now being blocked by a massive burning lizard.Just looking into its eyes would flood the fear of the previously attempted subjugation attempt.Takan slowly stood up, letting out a rather sharp ear-shattering roar. Fear began to take over Clevius the minute he saw Takan, his legs trembling.\u201cWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201dClevius clenched his teeth as he managed to get his trembling body under control. All of his senses were screaming at him to run away, but he knew there was no positive outcome if he were to throw everything away here.Fortunately, he had companions with him. He didn\u2019t need to deal with the overwhelming fear by himself. There was Ed Rothstaylor, who was, for some reason, overflowing with confidence while still remaining calm. There was also Lortel Kehelland, who was always able to stay cool-headed regardless of the crisis at hand. They were extremely different people compared to Clevius, who was prime to making a fuss and getting scared of even the smallest of crises.Clevius didn\u2019t think any of them would be able to deal any significant damage to Takan, but at least he didn\u2019t have to enter this hell alone. The fact that he wasn\u2019t alone served as solace in this hopeless situation\u201cIt\u2019s coming! The battle is starting! Now what\u2026?!\u201dAs he saw Takan run towards him, the burning lizard spirit looking like it was going to devour him, Clevius looked back at his teammates to ask about the plan.But nobody was there.Clevius didn\u2019t look back when he ran as fast as he could. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay attention to anything because he was in a state of panic, running with all of his strength.The corridor of Nail Hall stretched out far, and his teammates who should\u2019ve been running with him weren\u2019t there at all.A cold sweat ran down Clevius\u2019s back.\u201cI got tricked! You tricked me!\u201dClevius screamed, almost in tears.\u201cHEY, YOU CRAZY SHITS! HEY! WHERE ARE YOU?! COME OUT! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?! OF ALL PEOPLE, WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE SACRIFICE, HUH?! IF WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS, WE SHOULD HAVE JUST SENT TAYLEE! HE ALREADY VOLUNTEERED ANYWAY! SO WHY ME?! AHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201dClevius continued to scream in the most pathetic way as he ran like crazy, leaving Takan behind.If he knew this was going to happen, he shouldn\u2019t have trusted that damn Ed Rothstaylor. Clevius would\u2019ve persuaded Princess Penia, even if it meant hitting the floor and throwing a tantrum like an immature child.He blamed himself for believing in the commanding presence of Princess Penia and following this plan she approved of.\u201cWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?! AGHK! I HATE YOU! I HATE THIS WORLD! SAVE ME! PLEASE, I\u2019M SORRY! AGHHH!\u201dClevius running away with tears in his eyes was truly a pitiful sight.* * *\u201cAct like we\u2019re going to enter with him, and once Clevius is focused on Takan, we will run out of there. He wouldn\u2019t agree to this if we just tell him since he\u2019s such a scaredy-cat. That\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary we do it like this.\u201dThe light of dawn was rising from the east. This long night would soon come to an end.Lortel slowly closed her eyes only to open them again. She was in a corner of the Student Square where she could see the three large buildings: Nail Hall, which Clevius entered, the half-collapsed Glockt Hall in front of it, and right next to it was Obell hall, which Ed Rothstaylor just ran into.Pulling her full focus, she gathered all the magic power in her whole body.Her conversation with Ed a while ago played in her head again.\u201cThe first step is to make Clevius enter Nail Hall\u2019s corridor.\u201d\u201cSo you were just going to sacrifice Clevius in the end. It might not be a bad move, but morally speaking, criticism is inevitable.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said anything if it was such a one-dimensional plan.\u201dLortel focused on Clevius\u2019s screaming in the corridor, the sound ringing in her ears.\u201cYou have the most important role, Lortel. You\u2019ll be in charge of securing the entrance for the other group who will defeat Yennekar. You\u2019ll also be in charge of dealing the fatal blow to Takan.\u201dThere was no hint of hesitation in any of what Ed Rothstaylor said. In the midst of this confusing, chaotic, and urgent situation, he had no hesitation in making decisions. He had complete confidence in his own plans.Lortel closed her eyes.She had experienced countless crises since she was young, having been in business from an early ageThe reason a crisis was a crisis was because it was unexpected. From paperwork crises in logistics like the halt of distribution or an issue with the cash flow at a store, to a practical crisis like a business competitor\u2019s secret or scheme.From Lortel\u2019s experience, she knew very well that a crisis was a unique opportunity that gave insight into a human\u2019s true nature, as well as their worst qualities.She thought back to Ziggs just before he left the camp earlier.In an unpredictable crisis, he was disillusioned by his selfishness prioritizing his own emotions.She also remembered how Princess Penia helped Ziggs.She despised the fact that this person, who was supposed to be firmer and stronger than anyone else, made such a poor decision.A person who was truly trustworthy was one who looked for the answer in a time of unexpected crisis, while still holding strong to their beliefs. Someone who wasn\u2019t swallowed by fear or swayed by their emotions. And they should be someone who would never doubt their own beliefs.\u201cThe most urgent thing we need to do is to send the group that will defeat Yennekar into the Combat Practice Field. We can worry about how we can defeat Takan after. So make sure to focus on listening. When you think Takan is far away enough, destroy the wall next to the field to let them in.\u201dThe key was to keep Takan and Velosper apart.The worst possible outcome would be to deal with both of them at the same time.\u201cWhew\u2026 Well\u2026 I think he's showing off a bit too much\u2026\u201dLortel was originally in a position of directing others rather than receiving orders.But currently, she was only a first-year student. Not only that, but she was also in the same class as someone from the royal family.At Elte Company, Lortel had a quite high position that even old merchants would bow their heads toward her.She was someone who made her living in business, so she never had to be in an academic setting until now.But although she entered Silvenia out of a \u2018necessity\u2019, the essence shouldn\u2019t have had to change.A fallen noble. A person on the edge of a cliff with nothing left.She didn\u2019t have to listen to the orders of such a person.However, Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s words had a strange sense of conviction.He had confidence that they would overcome this crisis as long as they followed his plan. This crisis that even a monarch like Princess Penia was struggling with.The tone of his voice that had no ounce of doubt made it seem like he had already experienced countless crises.Just what was Ed Rothstaylor's worst quality?He returned Lortel\u2019s three gold coins when he shook her hand.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAs someone who lived in the slums before being picked up by The Golden King Elte, Lortel knew the mindset of someone pushed into a corner.She fully understood just how great of a temptation even a single gold coin was to a person who couldn't guarantee to live another day.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the type of person to jump to conclusions just by hearing mere rumors.\u201dLortel had a giant ice spear floating above her head. No matter how good Clevius was at taking hits or how fast his reaction speed was, Takan would eventually end up catching up.The only way was the aggressive decision to break down the walls of Nail Hall, walls that boasted a long history.It was quite a simple plan, but it wasn\u2019t a plan that would come to mind easily.They were students who usually walked around the academic district and visited the Student Center as if it was their own home.The magnificent Nail Hall was among the academy\u2019s pride and was a landmark that represented the Student Center.They never even considered or thought of it, taking it for granted, as it was a permanent part of their environment. To destroy it with their own hands was something they would have never thought of.But then, wasn\u2019t Glockt Hall already destroyed? No matter how many years a building has stood for, it could never take precedence over a person\u2019s life.These types of drastic decisions were needed in such a large crisis. It\u2019s just a building. They could just rebuild it. Either way, Takan was already going crazy inside anyway, so it probably already suffered a lot of damage.Who would be responsible for such destruction? This wasn\u2019t the time to be afraid of such things, but for inexperienced students, making these types of valid judgments was outside of their jurisdiction.The magnificent Student Center was the academy\u2019s treasure, it shouldn\u2019t be damaged so recklessly. In this situation, one wouldn\u2019t normally be able to make the best judgments, trapped by these rules and way of thinking.But if there was a fire in your home, you would have to break the window to escape. No matter how expensive the stained glass may be, no matter how valuable a piece of art might be, you would have to break that window without hesitation and escape. Destroying an old building like this, Lortel should have nothing to worry about.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I will destroy Nail Hall with my own hands. When else would I experience something like this?\u201dBut then again, Lortel had already blown off the roof of Nail Hall once.Having thought this far, she finally understood what Ed meant before he left for Obel Hall.\u201cYou\u2019re good at this type of stuff.\u201dLortel chuckled. Ed Rothstaylor really was quite an interesting guy.When this crisis is over, should she go and strike a casual conversation with him?BANG!!!Lortel smashed her ice spear into the outer wall of Nail Hall, nearest to the Combat Practice Field.Dust rose as the thick wall collapsed.She smiled neatly as she saw the other group waiting on the outskirts of the Student Square.Everyone\u2019s puzzled expression was quite memorable. Anyhow, their entry point had been secured.The only thing left to do was take care of Takan.They just had to buy enough time so the other group could defeat Yennekar. It was obvious what she needed to do now.\u201cIf we do something about its scales, then your magic will become effective against Takan. I\u2019ll take responsibility and figured out what to do about the scales, so just gather all the magic power you have and cast the strongest ice magic possible then.\u201dLortel became quite curious about this guy who gave such straight-to-the-point instructions.The possibility was slim, but perhaps, she had found someone just like her. Her heart would\u2019ve skipped a beat if that were the case, but she wasn\u2019t immature enough to get excited over such a slim possibility.Lortel quietly began to gather her magic as she watched the group in charge of defeating Yennekar enter the Combat Practice Field.This was a thousand times better than the commands of that princess who was still naive and easily swayed. Ed\u2019s was an unfounded conviction that it would all work out. And if this was the wrong way, then it would all be useless. But at least, right now, it didn\u2019t feel that way at all.\u201cKYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! LORTEL! I\u2019M GOING TO KILL YOU ALL!\u00a0 I WON\u2019T LEAVE YOU ALONE!\u201dClevius screamed as he ran out of Nail Hall, Takan almost catching up to him, on the verge of eating him whole.\u201cNEVER MIND! I\u2019M GOING TO DIE! IT\u2019S TOO DANGEROUS! SAVE ME! I\u2019M SORRY! I\u2019M SORRY I SAID I WOULD KILL YOU! I\u2019LL FORGIVE ALL OF YOU! JUST PLEASE SAVE ME!\u201dWatching him scream in a pathetic manner, Lortel gathered all the magic power in her body.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *BANG!!!Obel Hall was located on the southwest side of the Student Square. It was a building that Princess Penia would frequently visit when she become the Student Council president. It was full of privately owned rooms used as warehouses, along with conference facilities for the Student Council. It was a place of no importance right now, located outside of the current story.As I ran up the stairs like crazy, I could see the outer wall of Nail Hall collapsing outside the window.Lortel was able to secure the entry point as Clevius ran away in fear. Then I saw the group in charge of defeating Yennekar entering the Combat Practice Field. Having confirmed that everything was going according to plan, I continued my climb up the stairs.Act 1\u2019s finale has finally entered Phase 4. The Glasskan summoning ceremony was near completion, and the sun would soon rise in the sky from the east. I thought this would be our last chance. If we were to fail in defeating Yennekar here, then everything that would happen afterward would completely be unknown territory.This was such a crazy situation, the Takan and Velosper battles happening at the same time.It\u2019s completely arrogant to have a fair fight against Takan without\u00a0Elemental Slash.It would be like trying to burn a person to death when that person was wearing two or three layers of fireproof clothing.It might be possible to inflict a light burn or have them faint, but if you wanted to completely burn them to death, then there was no choice but to overwhelm them with firepower, or even use magma.But there wasn\u2019t a member among the subjugation team capable of doing that.Among\u00a0the subjugation team.BANG!I kicked open the door to Obel Hall\u2019s roof. The view of the entire rooftop greeted me\u2026 and a familiar witch hat caught my eyes.I would have stopped by Obell Hall first thing if I had the time, but I had to let the group in charge of defeating Yennekar in first because the summoning ceremony was just about completed. But it\u2019s a good thing I got to the roof of Obell Hall just in time to see this girl here. Everything would be okay now.If we were to discuss the method on how we should break through Takan\u2019s scales, we would have to go against the story of Act 1\u2019s finale. Instead, we would have to look at the first part of the strategy guide.\u25a0 Phase 1: Gathering your subjugation forceAchievement Conditions:Please gather these characters at the\u00a0Student Square!\u2018The Princess of Benevolence Penia\u2019\u2018The Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019\u2018The Golden Daughter Lortel\u2019\u2018Companion Ayla\u2019\u2018Nosy Elvira\u2019\u2018Gloomy Clevius\u2019For additional achievements, also gather:\u2018Romantic Adele\u2019\u2018Lazy Lucy\u2019\u2018Senior Maid Bell\u2019\u203b Meeting the additional achievement conditions only give a little bit of Likeability for each character. The characters will not participate in the subjugation. But try to meet \u2018Romantic Adele\u2019 since she gives a useful buff for attacking the boss later on.If you\u2019re trying to 100% clear the stage: Adele can be found playing ukelele in the grass behind the Western Archery Center, Lucy can be found taking a nap on the roof of Obel Hall, and Bell can be found next to a statue in Olin Square.There were barely any players who wanted to clear the additional achievements during the finale\u2019s Phase 1. The chapter was already short on time and finding the additional characters didn\u2019t mean they would participate in the subjugation, nor was the achievement itself that great in the first place. Additional achievements such as this were usually treated as useless content.But as I had already cleared this stage countless times, I already knew where the additional achievements were hiding. And I knew that among them was a weapon that would completely overturn the flow of the story.In front of me was a \u2018grenade\u2019 that could even break through the scales of Takan.A girl who was able to sleep through the ongoing crisis.A spear that would break through any shield no matter how thick it might be.If you were going against something irrational, then there was no choice but to counter it with something irrational yourself. If someone wasn\u2019t playing fair, then that leaves you no choice but to not play fair as well.I hadn\u2019t completely finished training yet. And my advantage of knowing insider information wouldn\u2019t enable me to defeat Takan.But there was no reason to be upset. This side was in desperate need as well.BANG!I jumped over the handrail and hurriedly picked up Lucy. She was so light that even the piles of firewood I carried every day seemed heavier.\u201cEh? Huh? Eghk?\u201dThis girl was taking a pleasant evening nap while the entire academic district was being destroyed. There should be a limit to how lucky someone can be.\u201cW-What? Ugh, so shaky\u2026 Uhhh\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even daytime anymore. It was already nighttime. This couldn\u2019t even be considered a nap at this point. I wanted to ask her why she\u2019d been sleeping for so long, but the reason was pretty obvious so I didn\u2019t.For Lazy Lucy, sleeping was a means to restore her power. And given how she ran away from the senior maid Bell last night, she consumed an enormous amount of mana and had not lost her energy.She used such high-ranking spatial-type magic with quick casting. It allowed her to skip the chanting altogether, and came all the way from Ophelis Hall to the northern forest. The only reason she ran out of magic power was because she did something this crazy. She needed to take a break if she wanted to recover that huge amount of mana back.It was very like her to be sleeping on the rooftop of Obel hall, but now is not the time to sleep.Besides, how many pieces of my jerky had she already eaten? She even ended up breaking my drying rack, something I had painstakingly made. She had to do something in return for it. There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world.But I'm not that cold-hearted. I took out the leather bag from the reading room and opened it. It was full of strips of jerky.\u201cHmm\u2026 Jerky\u2026? Something smells like jerky.\u201dShe was still half-asleep, so she didn't seem like she was conscious just yet. And yet she could still smell the jerky like some ghost.I grabbed a handful of the dried meat and stuffed it into Lucy\u2019s small mouth.\u201cEughk\u2013! Eugh\u2013!\u201d\u201cEat a lot.\u201dI then picked Lucy up once again and jumped over the railing once more.\u201cMughk! Mudhka!\u201d\u2018My jaw hurts! Too much!\u2019At least, that's what she sounded like.I could see the high-ranking fire spirit Takan over the handrail. And running away while crying from it was Clevius, who was excellently performing his part. Meanwhile, I could barely see Lortel, who seemed to be casting the largest ice spear she had ever made.Lucy\u2019s magic power probably hasn\u2019t fully recovered yet since her capacity to store mana was as deep and vast as the sea. It was likely she had only been able to recover a small portion of it.But that should be enough. Just like how Takan\u2019s existence was irrational, Lucy herself was also an irrational existence.\u201cOnce you\u2019re done eating, I need you to take care of that thing\u2019s scales!\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201dI positioned Lucy properly. She couldn\u2019t say anything properly because of all the jerky stuck in her mouth.Good thing the target was a lizard on fire, so we could clearly see it even in the dark.Would this distance be enough?There was nothing to worry about. I had already done this a bunch of times in the military.First, check the target.Second, remove the safety clip.Lastly, take out the safety pin and throw it!\u201cEveryone! Get down!\u201dI shouted with a voice so loud it spread across the Student Center.Then, I threw Lucy over the railing using all of my strength, straight to where Takan was visible.\u201cMuumama!\u201dLucy screamed, finally awake.\u201cMahfahaf Mafmad-!\u201dI think she said, \u2018This is too much!\u2019Sorry, Lucy. But from my point of view, this was the only way out.Lucy\u2019s screams, impeded by her mouthful of jerky, slowly echoed across the Student Square the farther she got away.This is too much\u2013 too much\u2013 too much\u2013There was a moment of silence as Lucy sailed across the sky.And then\u2013BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!It was the high-ranking lightning magic\u00a0Divine Judgment.The lightning magic spread around Lucy, covering the entire field. The shock happened in an instant, leaving behind a huge gust of wind that I had to hold onto the railing for support as it flew by.\u201cHah!\u201dNow that its scales have been blown away, us alone should be enough to take Takan down.I stood and climbed back onto the railing.It was about time to wrap things up.All this while, I\u2019d been worried my plan would fail, but having come this far, there was only one important thing left.It might sound a bit selfish considering the situation, but this was a serious matter.Takan was a high-ranking fire spirit. The amount of spirit-type experience I would get should be enormous\u2026 I couldn\u2019t let this go to waste!This was, somehow, the most important moment.\u201cLast hit\u2026!\u201dLast hit!I needed to get the last hit!I wouldn\u2019t give this up!I quickly ran to the side of the Student Square where Lortel and Clevius were.* * *\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, my beloved daughter, Yennekar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so proud to be your friend, Yennekar.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the hope of the second-years. You were the only one who properly showed off your skills this Joint Combat Practice.\u201d\u201cOf course, you can trust Yennekar.\u201d\u201cWithout you, us second-years would be the worst year. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Yennekar.\u201dThe memories leaking into her consciousness made her heart ache.Beyond the collapsed wall of Obel Hall, the sky had gradually begun to brighten.In the young girl\u2019s eyes, the twinkling stars had disappeared like melting snow.She couldn\u2019t help but sneer at herself as she witnessed such sentimental scenery.The number of students who came to defeat her was not as large as she had expected.She quietly stood up from chatting a choral song in the middle of the Combat Training Field.The oak wand she always carried was now stained black.The eyes of the spirits protecting her were different from usual. They were glaring. And those who saw it couldn\u2019t help but have their hairs stand on end.Hidden among the many fluid spirits, the low-ranking spirits, and the spiritual spirits\u2026 the young girl who was chanting a spell slowly glanced back.Shedding tears, she looked for the face of a certain boy.But that boy wasn\u2019t there. That was an obvious fact.The faces of the students who came to stop her were all stiff.Velosper\u2019s curse had embroidered itself all over her body like chains that bind her. She gave a regretful smile and quietly kept on reciting the mantra.\u201cWelcome.\u201dAct 1 Finale\u2019s final battle.The subjugation of Yennekar Palerover.Sadly, there wasn\u2019t much time left to talk things out with each other.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (6)The tip of her nose was tingling.This was a familiar feeling to Yennekar.Like when she would put too much pepper in her cream soup at the cafeteria, or when she would get into an argument with her close friend Clara, or when her beloved father got seriously injured after getting hit by a cow at the farm, or when she came back to Silvenia after the long break.Whenever it happened, Yennekar would endure the insistent feeling that would creep up the tip of her nose, a frown on her forehead.\"I guess I want to cry.\"She knew this feeling.She would always smile like a princess in some children\u2019s fairytales. Everyone knew there was no one more thoughtful than her.Just spending a day with her would enable anyone to see that the source of her uniquely youthful and relaxed attitude was, ironically, her extremely mature character.Everyone, from family to friends, to faculty, to upperclassmen, and to those who were younger\u2014all couldn\u2019t help but look at her in envy. She was a promising talent who never once lost her position as the top student among the second-years of the Magic Department.Yennekar lived her life with these expectations.She lifted her head and looked at the sight before her.The high-ranking dark spirit Velosper was leisurely reigning over the top of Nail Hall\u2019s Combat Practice Field. He had the arms and legs of a human but his head was strange, like that of a goat\u2019s. His bat0like wings were gigantic, stretching from his back and covering the whole of Nail Hall. He was holding a flaming mace in one hand, and it looked like it could wipe out all the seats in the field in an instant.Needless to say, he clearly had the appearance of a devil. It was an appearance that would surely inspire fear in those who would see him as they swallow their breaths and take a step back. However, the subjugation team firmly stood in their place with an unwavering gaze.Taylee McLaure, Ayla Triss, Penia Elias Kroel, Ziggs Eiffelstein, and Elvira Aniston.The face of each student was burning with a firm will and fighting spirit rather than a sense of fear.Yennekar looked at them, and then slowly closed her eyes. She naturally felt an impending sense of defeat.She would disgracefully lose this battle, that much was certain.However, the emotions pouring out of her chest were not frustration nor grief.She opened her eyes gently, and shortly after, lifted her oak wand.Just as she expected, the tip of her nose was tingling.To Yennekar, it was quite a familiar sensation.* * *I ran down like a madman from the roof of Obel Hall down to the Student Square and saw that they were nearly done finishing Takan off.Crash! Crash!\u201cEUGHAAK! KYAAGHK! DIE, YOU SON OF A BITCH! JUST DIE ALREADY!\u201dLucy\u2019s high-ranking lightning magic was frighteningly powerful, but it wasn\u2019t enough to kill Takan immediately.But even still, considering the fact that Lucy\u2019s power was not at its best and that she couldn\u2019t properly cast magic in such a sudden situation, the fact that Takan was still able to endure her attack deserved applause.However, she still managed to completely burn off Takan\u2019s scales, so his tremendous magic resistance was now gone.Magic would be able to finish it off now.This one fact had just decreased the difficulty of defeating this giant flaming lizard.Clevius continued to scream as he avoided Takan\u2019s attacks. And even though he was trembling in fear with tears streaming down his face, his movements were quite mysterious yet marvelous as he avoided getting hit and kicked by Takan\u2019s tail.This may have been due in part to Clevius\u2019s high Agility, but it was also because Takan\u2019s movement had noticeably slowed down compared to the beginning.Like an animal on the verge of death, it was making its final last-ditch effort to survive.Takan let out a piercing roar that echoed through the sky and over the Student Square.Its roar from before was fierce, similar to that of a belligerent warrior, rushing into battle. But now, Takan\u2019s roar was a scream due to intolerable pain.I would make that pain go away soon.I went to Lortel who was continuously supplying firepower.\u201cWhere\u2019s Lucy?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s rolling around somewhere. It\u2019d be nice if she could finish this off but I\u2019m not sure she has the energy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dIt was a relief, in fact. What if she ended up finishing Takan off? I was actually worried about that. Because no matter how low her magic power was right now, Lucy could definitely defeat Takan easily.As I had mentioned, my ultimate goal was to land the last hit on Takan so I could get that enormous amount of Spirit-type Skill experience points.And there was a high chance that Lucy\u2019s overwhelming power would most likely interfere with that.\u201cI didn\u2019t get to see it but Clevius is quite impressive as a vanguard. I didn\u2019t expect him to draw Takan\u2019s attention away to this extent with that injury. If only he would keep that mouth shut, then he would be a great warrior.\u201d\u201cNah, that blabbering mouth of his is his trump card.\u201d\u201cHEY! AGHK! YOU GUYS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STARING AROUND LIKE IDIOTS! SAVE ME! PLEASE! SHOOT SOME MAGIC! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! AGGGHK! I\u2019M GOING TO DIE AT THIS RATE! PLEASE!\u201dClevius\u2019s biggest strength was that people viewed him as insignificant. He screams like crazy no matter what he does, naturally making people look down on him. This makes them think they could easily take him down when, in fact, they couldn\u2019t.He may be imperfect, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t valuable. He was, after all, the top student among the Combat Department first-years.It was ironic how his low self-esteem often became his strength.I also understood where Takan was coming from. Clevius seemed easy enough to deal with as he buzzed around like a mosquito, like Takan could\u2019ve finished him off with a single flick of its tail. But no matter how many times Takan tried to get rid of him, it couldn\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019M NOT LETTING YOU GUYS OFF THE HOOK! REALLY! YOU\u2019RE USING ME LIKE BAIT AND YOU\u2019RE JUST SITTING AROUND! I\u2019M NOT GOING TO LET THIS GO!\u201dHe was eventually going to reach his limit with how he was running around and screaming like crazy.\u201cLet\u2019s wrap this up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. I\u2019ve already landed two ice spears but it just kept clinging for its life. It really does have all sorts of defenses.\u201d\u201cWe need to cut its neck.\u201dI gathered all my remaining magic power and focused it on my fingertips. After training to my limit at the library earlier, my remaining magic power was nearly all out. But it was still enough to cast a few beginner spells a few times.\u201cI\u2019ll do it, since your ice-type magic isn\u2019t suited to cutting cleanly. I\u2019ll take responsibility and finish this off so you just stop its movements once. You can do that, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. If we do it now.\u201dWhat\u2019s important was attacking Takan\u2019s weakness.Now that it has no scales around its body, even Taylee would be able to cut through it. Yes, even if Taylee is yet to finish his proper training according to the original timeline.I should be able to cut it off with a single strike using\u00a0Wind Blade, this skill having exceeded level 10 in proficiency.My problem was distance. Takan was able to destroy anything that came near it as it swing its tail and stomped its feet like crazy. If I enter Takan\u2019s range and make even a single mistake, I would be killed in one shot. It was truly amazing how Clevius was managing to avoid its attacks. It almost looked like a circus.\u201cYou need to restrict its movements the moment I approach Takan, and at that moment, I\u2019m going to cut its off head with\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0close range. If I don\u2019t defeat Takan then, I\u2019ll be in danger too.\u201dI tapped Lortel\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m risking my life and entrusting you with it, so you have to make sure to do this right.\u201d\u201cHaha! You always say things like, \u2018I\u2019ll take responsibility and finish it off\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m risking my life and entrusting you with it\u2019 so easily\u2026 but isn\u2019t this all just a gamble?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a gamble.\u201dWith how fed up I was with constantly having to deal with her in the game, I knew how to handle the Golden Daughter Lortel all too well. No matter what extraordinary event happened from Act 1 all the way to the final chapter, she was someone who was always able to regain her composure despite being taken aback for a moment. She was a monster when it came to being reasonable.There were many situations in the original story where she had to act with more urgency and carefulness than she was now. So even though she was acting like she wasn\u2019t sure, I already knew what was going on in that head of hers. This was why she\u2019s perfect in situations like this, situations where everyone needs to remain calm and composed until the very end.\u201cThis is an investment. Life isn\u2019t cheap so make sure to get the job done well.\u201dLortel\u2019s face hardened for a moment after my words, then she started to treat it as something fun.\u201cAn investment\u2026 That\u2019s my specialty.\u201dShe smiles a mischievous smile.\u201cBut frankly speaking, isn\u2019t it better to leave the close combat to Clevius? After all, he\u2019s the Combat Department\u2019s top student among the first-years. And if you\u2019re going to cut something off, isn\u2019t it better to use a sword?\u201dThat was a valid opinion. There wasn\u2019t any reason for me to get involved in close combat as a student from the Magic Department. Clevius, on the other hand, was expertly dodging Takan\u2019s attacks with such incredible movement. He should be able to get up close to the terrifying Takan and cut off its arms and throat.But I needed to do it.Why?It\u2019s because I needed to land the last hit!The high-ranking fire spirit Takan was a treasure full of enormous Combat and Spirit Skill experience points that I couldn\u2019t afford to pass up.But not like I could tell Lortel that. So I had to improvise with a believable lie instead.\u201cDoes it look like Clevius is in any capacity to do that right now?\u201dLortel\u2019s eyes seemed to slightly widen at my answer, and then she let out a beautiful smile, as if flowers were blooming.\u201cIt\u2019s true that distracting Takan and actually running up close to it are two entirely different issues. There\u2019s no way that scaredy-cat Clevius would be able to do that. Alright, then\u2026\u201dAll this while, Clevius was screaming his head off in the background as he was chased by Takan. Although nobody really cared about it.Maybe if Takan was still in his prime condition and had the\u00a0Berserk\u00a0buff applied. But it won\u2019t be able to easily defeat Clevius while in this weakened state. Clevius was so agile he was like a buzzing mosquito flying about.\u201cPlease don\u2019t die. You cannot.\u201dLortel spoke harshly, and the way she had her eyebrows raised in a funny way and acting all tough was definitely meant to rudely imitate the way Princess Penia speaks.\u201cYou\u2019re insulting the royal family.\u201d\u201cThe princess wouldn\u2019t punish me for such a silly impression since she\u2019s known for being benevolent. But if you\u2019re curious if really would punish me, why don\u2019t you try telling her, Ed?\u201dAnd the next thing she said was really quite something.\u201cFrankly speaking, I don\u2019t like Princess Penia. I\u2019m sure she has her own reasons but I\u2019m sick and tired of being told what to do by that naive leader.\u201d\u201cThose are quite dangerous words you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just hilarious that such a naive person will occasionally pretend and act like a monarch just because she was born with royal blood. We should be looking at people\u2019s abilities before their blood in order for there to be proper order in the world.\u201dI stood still without saying anything and just continued to listen.\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is quite dangerous, huh? It\u2019s been a while since I was able to fully expressed my true feelings.\u201d\u201cWhat would happen if I were to report this to the princess?\u201d\u201cWho knows? I can\u2019t say for sure. Maybe she won\u2019t believe you or maybe I\u2019ll face capital punishment. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know for sure unless you try, right?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose for saying all of this?\u201dWith a playful smile, what Lortel said next was just so like her that I couldn\u2019t say anything more.\u201cJust how you\u2019re risking your life and entrusting it with me, I\u2019m risking my life and entrusting it to you too.\u201dShe raised both of her hands as if to yield.\u201cBoth sides of a double-pan balance scale must always be kept level. That\u2019s the secret to the Elte Company\u2019s longevity and success.\u201dIt was a bit lame to point it out since we both knew that saying was hypocrisy.But if I were to think about it, this was just how Lortel Kehelland was. Even the way she pays respects was unnecessarily complicated. There was never a simple way for her to express her feelings.And that was one of the characteristics of a merchant.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *I should finish this up before Clevius ended up peeing his pants.As crazy as it may sound, the battle against Velosper and the battle against Takan were happening at the same time. And somehow, Act 1\u2019s finale, even though it was different from the original timeline, was actually looking like it would end well.Once the other group entered the Velosper battle, Taylee should acquire the\u00a0Swordmaster Skill, and from there on, there shouldn\u2019t be any more unexpected events.Though the skill\u2019s strength became a bit more ambiguous as time went on, its overpowered specs for Act 1 made it quite powerful. Every player knew how helpful the skill was to break through the early game story.As long as Penia was able to set up her defense magic and Ziggs was in charge of tanking, then Taylee alone would be enough to defeat Velosper.The story should go back on track the moment we finish off Takan and clear the road.It was obvious what was going to happen next. Velosper would cast another large-scale Berserk on all the spirits once Yennekar and the subjugation force face off. This would push the team into a corner but, at that moment, Taylee would use his\u00a0Swordmaster Skill\u00a0and cut down Velosper in one fell swoop. And just as Velosper was about to die, he would use Yennekar to trigger the incomplete Glasskan summoning circle.Of course, summoning Glasskan with an incomplete circle was not possible. However, Velosper would succeed in summoning the demon\u2019s right arm. Glasskan would begin to wipe out the subjugation force with his magic emanating from his right arm, how whole power covering the entirety of the academic district. But then Taylee would ounce again use his Swordmaster Skill and cleanly cut off the right arm.And at that moment, Taylee would realize the way of the sword, kicking off the rest of the story.If the story returned to progressing like in the original timeline, then I would only need to take care of myself from then onwards.Anyhow, this was a chance for me to defeat a named boss, the high-ranking fire spirit Takan. I couldn\u2019t waste this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The best thing to do right now was to defeat that lizard and exponentially increase my Spirit Skills proficiency, the proficiency that was just barely short of reaching my goal a while ago.\u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201dI took a long deep breath as I walked out of the Student Square. Lortel had already prepared an ice spear and nodded her head. The relaxed atmosphere between the both of us a while ago was nowhere to be seen. She completely believed that I was putting my life on the line and entrusting it to her.This was something that required a great deal of courage, but it wasn\u2019t impossible. I knew Takan\u2019s stats like the back of my hand, and he was also in a weakened state. This meant I could easily win as long as Lortel backed me up on time. The key was the attack Takan\u2019s weakness. To cut its throat.\u201cKYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201dClevius was still running around like crazy, having completely lost his mind by now. It looked like Takan had slowly realized that Clevius wasn\u2019t that easy to take care of, even though he completely looked easy, to begin with.As I quickly approached them, Takan turned toward me.Both Takan and I were in a state of total exhaustion.We both realized this fact.Then Takan roared as he charged at me. The ground shook beneath my feet, my ears pounding, Seeing Takan turned directly at me, I understood why Clevius was scared beyond his wits. Even though it was completely exhausted, Takan ran like crazy, dragging along its injured body with the determination to kill its opponent.No.Not yet.I needed to be closer.Lortel knew as she waited to fire her ice spears. I had to get closer, even closer, to make sure that his neck would be in the range of my magic.Then\u2013BOOM!Something unexpected happened all of a sudden. Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle embroidered itself in the sky.\u201cKYAAAAAAAAAAAH! WHAT IS THAT?!\u201dThe first person to scream was Clevius.Glasskan\u2019s summoning circle emitted a dazzling light in the morning sky as dawn rose from the horizon. And then a humongous right hand ripped through the circle covering the entirety of Nail Hall.Velosper had been defeated.It was the sound of the start of Phase 5. And once Taylee cut down Glasskan\u2019s arm, then the entire Act would be over.No matter where you were in the academic district, chances were, you could clearly see the disaster unfolding. The sight of a demon\u2019s right hand coming out of a summoning circle high up in the sky, a dark energy emanating from it, definitely would look like it was the end of the world.I knew this was going to happen, but the timing of it wasn\u2019t good.It was a sight impossible to take your eyes off regardless of who was watching. It looked like the apocalypse was upon us. It would be weird if you weren\u2019t paying attention to it.But Takan wasn\u2019t like that, and that was a problem.Seeing Takan still charge at me like a madman, I looked at Lortel. But even though she was probably distracted, the moment I shouted at her, an ice spear flew.The ice spear struck Takan right on its face, stealing its sight and hearing. Takan screamed.Lortel turned around and looked at me, her face serious. Even in the midst of such a crisis, she focused on me. Her lips were clearly saying \u2018Do it now,\u2019 entrusting me with the rest of the work.The next part wasn\u2019t hard.I turned back around and looked up to see a giant flaming lizard writhing in pain.I cast\u00a0Wind Blade, a spell I must\u2019ve used hundreds of thousands of times by now, and drove it right into its neck.\u300a You have defeated the high-ranking fire spirit Takan! \u300b\u300a Spirit-type magic \u2018Spirit Resonance\u2019 level has increased! \u300b\u300a Spirit-type magic \u2018Spirit Understanding\u2019 level has increased! \u300b\u300a Spirit-type magic \u2018Spirit Resonance\u2019 level has increased! \u300b\u300a Spirit-type magic \u2018Spirit Understanding\u2019 level has increased! \u300b\u300a Spirit-type magic \u2018Spirit Resonance\u2019 level has increased! \u300b\u300a Spirit-type magic \u2018Spirit Understanding\u2019 level has increased! \u300b\u300a Spirit contract slots have opened! You can now sign contracts with spirits! \u300b* * *\u201cI have seen so many people sincerely risk their lives throughout my life. Though they were all cowards.\u201dThe manifestation of Takan had completely dissipated, leaving no traces behind.I, along with Lortel, Clevius and Lucy, sat side by side under a Zelkova tree just outside the Student Square.Clevius was weeping terribly for a while until he completely passed out on the grass in exhaustion. Lucy was munching on jerky as she leaned on me, until she fell asleep. This stray cat would probably go off and disappear again anytime soon.The sun was rising over the half-destroyed Nail hall. Up high in the sky, there was a crack in the barrier covering the academic district.I didn\u2019t need to explain what happened after the right arm of Glasskan was summoned. Taylee jumped into the air and cut it down in an instant using his\u00a0Swordmaster Skill. It was so straightforward that I couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh. Of course, there must have been a really dramatic scene happening at Nail Hall, but this was all the view we got from the outside.I thought it was hilarious how the final chapter of Act 1 was about Glasskan\u2019s subjugation, and yer Glasskan was defeated in just one cut scene. I wonder if they had the same impression as when I played the game.Even still, the entirety of the academic district was engulfed in a gale as the manifested right arm of Glasskan was cut down, truly worthy to be part of the main character\u2019s story arc. Everyone was looking at the brilliantly splendid scene, well except for Lucy who was already dozing off at that time.And just like that, the curtain fell on Act 1.\u201cOf course, the main force of the subjugation efforts was the group who went inside the field, and they must have fought with their lives at risk. But didn\u2019t we also go out and risk our lives out here as well? We could go ahead and be proud of what we did. We really did risk our lives for this one.\u201dLortel said uselessly as she smirked.\u201cWell, in a life dedicated to business, risk is inevitable. Though this was my first time in such a situation. It was quite an experience.\u201dShe had so much audacity for someone who nearly died just a few moments ago. Well, I guess her life wasn\u2019t any less difficult than Taylee\u2019s. She must have experienced a few crises similar to this one already.\u201cYeah.\u201dI nodded as I looked up at the bright sky.Perhaps Lortel didn\u2019t like my simple reaction because she sat up with a grumpy expression on her face and pushed toward me.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? We overcame a life and death crisis but you don\u2019t seem too happy about it.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m so tired I feel like I\u2019m going to die. I also couldn\u2019t sleep at all. It should be the same for you too, no?\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. I\u2019m not even sure what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201dThe sun rose as the light of dawn lit up the day. It had been a long night.Finally, I saw one of the subjugation team walk out of the half-destroyed Nail Hall.Taylee was walking up front. Having acquired the\u00a0Swordmaster Skill, his black hair was not light gray and the color of his eyes had turned bright red. He was followed by Ayla, Princess Penia, Ziggs, and Elvira. Ziggs must have gone through a lot as the team\u2019s vanguard because he came out limping, and even Elvira looked as if she was on the verge of collapsing at any moment.At least everyone seemed safe. Things seemed to have followed the original story, somehow.Lortel stood up as she greeted and congratulated the subjugation force for their victory.Only to stop and suddenly look back, as if she had remembered something, She then reached her hand out to me as if to introduce herself, and cunningly said her own name.\u201cLortel Kehelland.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m officially introducing myself again. Well, I won\u2019t pull any crazy pranks against you. From now on, that is.\u201dWhen she said crazy pranks, she was probably talking about the last time when she suddenly approached me and gave me money.I knew it. She approached me then with hidden intentions. I already expected it, of course.\u201cAlright\u2026 Good choice.\u201dI thoughtlessly accepted Lortel\u2019s handshake since I was tired. But I didn\u2019t expect what she would do next.Lortel wrapped her small hand around my own and shook it a few times, before quickly letting go and putting her hands behind her back.She looked like a downright troublemaker with the way she was walking backward.\u201cI won this time.\u201dThat fox-like smile was her trademark.I opened my hand and saw three gold coins inside. She had taken revenge on me returning them to her last time.\u201cYou let your guard down, didn\u2019t you? Now, you owe me a favor. What should I do now?\u201dLortel kept grinning at me like the troublemaker that she is before she turned around to greet the party.\u201cSee you again, Ed.\u201dLortel left me with such words before she walked towards the subjugation team first.I sighed as I looked at the sun rising up in the sky.I knew Lortel had a foxy side to her. Well, just because I got some money while I was in debt didn\u2019t mean I would be swayed. Lortel knew that too, and yet she gave me the money anyway. She must have wanted to remain in contact in the future, and use this as justification for it.\u201cAn investment\u2026 That\u2019s my specialty.\u201dI can\u2019t help but want to give her a round of applause in admiration for putting her words into practice.Anyhow, the Glasskan Subjugation chapter had ended well.This was the perfect time to make such internal monologues while watching the subjugation force walking out of the hall with their backs against the rising sun.It was a difficult hurdle, but we got through it pretty well. As I watched the sky slowly turn brighter, I wanted to congratulate myself.Good work, me. Though it\u2019s just Act 1, I somehow managed to get through it all quite well.\u201c\u2026so what about Yennekar?\u201dI suddenly felt like a core piece of the story was still missing. There was an indescribable emptiness left, as if an important part of the story had been completely skipped over.It was the empty puzzle piece that had changed Yennekar\u2019s every move, and it still remained empty.The Glasskan Subjugation chapter ended well, and even though there was an unexpected hiccup in the middle, ultimately, the story returned to the original flow of the game. And there were no casualties. Shouldn\u2019t this mean that everything ended well\u2026And yet, there were so many things I was worried about that I couldn\u2019t just let things end like this.\u201cCome to think of it, I don\u2019t see our upperclassman Yennekar.\u201dFrom this distance, I couldn\u2019t see Yennekar with the subjugation force. Since they had defeated her, wasn\u2019t it only natural that someone carried her out on their back?\u201cWell, everyone\u2019s focus was completely on Glasskan\u2019s right arm during the battle. I\u2019m sure Yennekar was just left behind.\u201dLortel tilted her head at me as she walked away from the team.\u201cCome to think of it, I think I know what happened to Yennekar for her to do this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI happened to run into Yennekar in the hallways of Ophelis Hall some time ago. We made up with each other for what happened at the Joint Combat Practice.\u201dAnd as if it was nothing, Lortel continued to talk.\u201cI just happened to take a look into her room\u2026\u201dLortel continued to take slow steps forward as she talked.\u201cWould you like to hear my story? Hmm, Ed?\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Glasskan Subjugation Expedition (7)\u201cThank you.\u201dThe damp air of dawn blew against my face.Although now wasn\u2019t the appropriate time to be thinking about this, there was still something I wanted to say.The crisis just barely got solved before things turned for the worst thanks to the first-year ace students. Taylee seemed to have also acquired the\u00a0Swordmaster Skill, and as long as he had that skill, the story shouldn\u2019t run into any issues for the time being, which was a relief.The half-destroyed Nail Hall and Glockt Hall.The broken trees, the benches and fences that were piled up here and there that were used as a barricade, and the marble floor of the Student Square that had completely shattered into pieces due to Takan stomping around.The other parts of the academic district were not in a good shape as well.Calculating just how much damage had been done was meaningless. There was no way to exactly calculate it anyway.There were serious injuries and an uncountable number of minor injuries as well. Fortunately, there were no casualties.\u201cFrankly speaking, I still feel resentment towards you.\u201dTaylee had his head lowered and his whole body was covered in wounds. He was the one who ran all over the academic district and gathered the members of the subjugation force, and he was the one whose sword cut down Velosper and Glasskan during the battle.It was a glorious achievement that deserved praise from everyone around him but Tayle didn\u2019t have the corners of his mouth raised into a smile at all.\u201cI think you know the reason why better than anyone else.\u201dTaylee\u2019s eyes were still filled with hostility.I looked around. The subjugation force members who went through all sorts of hardships were gathered together in front of the Student Center. They have completed everything and are on their way to a glorious return.The students waiting at the base in the center of the Student Square would applaud and cheer for them once they return, and the long night\u2019s story would finally come to an end.It had been a long and tiring night but somehow, it was finally over. Act 1 ended on such a note. We would go straight into Act 2 next. The episode dealing with a war of nerves between the Elte Company and the academy.\u201cStill, I owe you a lot.\u201dAlthough Taylee said that, his hostility didn\u2019t disappear.\u201cI need to at least pay my respects. No matter how much I resent you, the subjugation wouldn\u2019t have even happened had you not blocked Takan in the first place.\u201dHe made sure to show his gratitude even though he was clenching his teeth with such hostility. This was the kind of person Taylee McLaure was.\u201cAh, Taylee. You\u2019re quite uptight, huh? Haha! If you hate me, just say you hate me. Why are you compartmentalizing your emotions and saying you\u2019re grateful for what I did even if you hated me?\u201dNosy Elvira burst out laughing despite being completely exhausted.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Tayle! You don\u2019t have to be polite to this guy. The only reason he helped was to save his own ass. Isn\u2019t he the type of person who\u2019d backstab you if your goals don\u2019t align? When we were taking care of Takan, he only used me as bait and treated my life like some measly fly's\u2026! Seriously! This dude\u2026!\u201d\u201cClevius, you\u2019re too loud.\u201d\u201cYou talk quite a bit, Clevius.\u201d\u201cBe quiet, Clevius.\u201dLortel, Princes Penia and Ziggs said one after the other, stopping Clevius from saying another word. He probably felt timid at being chastised so he quietly walked away with dropped shoulders.\u201cTaylee is right, Ed. I can\u2019t just blindly trust you but it\u2019s clear that you did quite a bit of work here. That\u2019s definitely something deserving of praise. If you submit a post of recommendation to the academic council, whatever it may be, it will be accepted.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go that far, princess.\u201dAnd then I spoke of some objective facts.\u201cThe biggest help during the Takan subjugation was Lucy, while Taylee was the one who cut Velosper and Glasskan down, so there\u2019s no need to give me such praise. Please focus on them rather than me.\u201d\u201cOh my, you\u2019re trying to give credit to others. Everyone already knows Lucy and Taylee played a big part during the battles. What we\u2019re talking about here is something else\u2026 or wait. Is it\u2026 are you, perhaps, embarrassed?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a whole year above you. Speak with some respect, Elvira.\u201dZiggs flicked Elvira\u2019s forehead, making her squeal as she stepped back, allowing Ziggs to come up and talk to me.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the details back at the base, Ed. We can't possibly come to a conclusion while walking on the street like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut I stood still, unmoving.The others were already heading back to the Student Square when they realized I was still where I was. They turned around one by one and looked at me.As dawn settled upon us, these exhausted and injured characters were to return home with a victory.Taylee, Ayla, Princess Penia, Ziggs, Lortel, Clevius and Elvira.I trusted that these main characters would be able to progress through the story from now on. Pure baseless confidence it may be, but I trusted that they would somehow figure out how to solve any ordeal that would arise in the future.I had been watching over them all these times, and they kept getting entangled in unexpected events due to changing variables.This Glasskan Subjugation chapter could have potentially been a story-breaking event. And yet they were able to handle it to this extent. Didn't this mean they should be fine dealing with future events that wouldn't have an outside variable to mess things up?I thought of that as I looked at this group of main characters.I had been maintaining my distance from them so I wouldn't affect the flow of the story. However, seeing them up close like this, I couldn\u2019t help but feel warm inside.I had been watching them do their designated roles in this world, solving their own problems day in and day out.There was Taylee who kept getting stronger with each ordeal he faced, and there was also Ayla who kept getting stronger so she could support Taylee. There was Princess Penia who was surely growing into an adult as she started to accept her destiny as the future queen, and Ziggs who was finding his own way in the midst of civilization. There was also Lortel who was starting to question her life of nothing but money, as well as Clevius who was starting to gain confidence in himself. And lastly, there was Elvira who was starting to realize that having fun wasn't everything life had to offer.I was well aware of each of their hardships and the challenges that they would face. At the same time, I also knew of the successes that would later come to them.Each of them had their own role. And although their roads may sometimes get bumpy and rough, the end of it was a sparkling red carpet for everyone.Success awaits them at the very end, and everyone would praise them as the kingdom's brilliant heroes.\u201cThere\u2019s something I left behind at Nail Hall. You guys go first.\u201dI knew that fact very well, so I turned my head and walked away.Now that the crisis was over, it was time to put the puzzle pieces together.I went back to Nail Hall\u2019s Combat Practice Field. I walked down the half-destroyed corridor and opened the large wooden door\u2026 to reveal what didn't look like the field at all.Ziggs's wind magic must have blown all the seats away, and the floor was littered with craters and gaps here and there. The curtains were all completely burned down and the walls were also full of holes as well.The air was cool inside as it blew in from the open ceiling where Glasskan\u2019s right arm had pierced through. The roofless hall revealed a sky in which darkness was beginning to recede.These were the traces of the final battle with Velosper.The stage where Act 1 ended.It was a place that would not show up again in the later chapters of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster.\u2019I walked between the spectator seats that had been blown every which way and headed for the podium up front. And right below it was the spare podium where Lucy took a nap that time during the Joint Combat Practice class.Rattle!I opened the door below and found Yennekar hugging her knees to herself as she giggled a soft \u2018hehe,\u2019 looking every bit as awkward since I caught her hiding.* * *It was cozier than I thought. I think I now knew why Lucy took a nap down here.The spare podium in the half-destroyed Combat Practice Field.I sat next to Yennekar as I looked up at the sky. The barrier that covered the sky and isolated the academic district was starting to crack little by little.\u201cI didn\u2019t know I would be found so easily. The other students seemed too busy with Glasskan that they had forgotten about me.\u201d\u201cWith something that enormous summoned through the sky, who would have the time to worry about you?\u201d\u201cEven then, it still hurt my feelings. I was doing this and that on such a grand scale but the moment everything was solved\u2026 I couldn\u2019t believe they just left me behind. \u2018Where is Yennekar?\u2019, I thought they would have at least asked that and looked for me, if even for just a bit.\u201dThe members of the subjugation force were already completely exhausted so they would have wanted to return to the base as soon as possible rather than search every nook and cranny of Nail Hall to find Yennekar who had disappeared immediately after the battle. The professors and faculty staff would eventually come and take care of the rest of the work here after they break down the barrier anyways.\u201cBut you were hiding because you didn\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to deny\u2026 hehe.\u201dYennerkar didn\u2019t look normal either. Her whole body was covered in dust and the shawl that was wrapped around her shoulders was torn in several places. The results of a fierce final battle.Hugging her knees, Yennekar looked up at the sky. Her body which was entirely covered by Velosper\u2019s curse a while ago still had some traces left. But once her magic power returns, she would be able to start purifying herself, and her body would quickly return to its original pale skin.\u201cI didn\u2019t know I would be found so soon. I wanted to hide for a bit longer.\u201d\u201cYou would\u2019ve gotten caught right away once the barrier is broken and the faculty comes in.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be alone until then. I didn\u2019t want to show myself to anyone.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dShe smiled at the question.\u201cUhm\u2026 I was planning on ugly crying.\u201dSaying that as if it wasn\u2019t weird\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s too embarrassing to show that side of me to others.\u201dBut hearing her words, I felt as if the question that had been plaguing me for years had finally been resolved.Why was Yennekar Palerover the boss for Act 1?Unlike the game\u2019s other bosses, her actions were rather passive. She also didn\u2019t have a distinctive aesthetic of her own, nor did she have a destiny she needed to achieve, nor did she have the qualities of a pure villain.Amongst all the amazing bosses of the game, Yennekar Palerover was given the role of the first boss who would begin the story. As a player, you couldn\u2019t help but think something wasn\u2019t right.I couldn\u2019t figure out the reason even after all the research I did. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the developers probably went with her because it would have a lot of \u2018impact\u2019 on new players.Yennekar was always bright, sincere, and loved by everyone. For someone like her to be taken over by a dark spirit and get in the player\u2019s way, wouldn\u2019t that be shocking and unconventional enough? Whatever hidden meaning there may be, the impact and reveal of her as the first act\u2019s boss had a significant enough impact to make up for the lack of it.After I came to this conclusion, I didn\u2019t think much of the darkness that was supposed to have fed Velosper, lurking in Yennekar\u2019s mind.But as it turned out\u2026 it actually wasn\u2019t that complicated.Rather, it was such an extremely easy and common story that it never even crossed my mind.\u201cI just happened to take a look into her room then.\u201dYennekar\u2019s room that Lortel had taken a look into. And the sight that she had seen. It was only after Lortel told me that I was finally able to put all the pieces together.Taylee was allowed to enter Ophelis Hall during Act 2\u2019s mid-boss fight where the player was tasked to defeat \u2018Ophelis Hall\u2019s Maid Elris.\u2019While chasing after the enemies inside the dormitory, the player was allowed to enter the room of different characters and among them was Yennekar\u2019s room.It was only a brief scene during an urgent battle, but the glimpse you get of Yennekar\u2019s room was definitely strange.She had a spacious room filled with all sorts of photos and writings. On her desk was a photo of her family, along with letters of support from them. Next to the letters are the messages from her loving friend and the awards and certificates from her professors and the faculty members, each of them filled with nothing but praises and expectations. And on the wall above her desk was a postcard from her hometown.And what was her view from her desk? There were cute accessories given to her by her friends and a vase of well-maintained lilies and roses gifted to her by the academy. On one side were her trophies won from competitions held by the academy, all regularly wiped sparkling-clean. On another side were four oak wands, all given as a gift by upperclassmen to congratulate her for signing a contract with Takan. She also had a beautiful cosmos-shaped wooden statue sent by her family that she had placed in a corner. Next to it lined up were accessories in the shape of elemental spirits, given to her as a gift by her Elementalist Studies professor. She also had a bouquet of flowers made by her friends from her after-school club. She also had all her used magic tools nicely packed and sent by her family. Although a bit bulky so she had them under her desk.Opening her drawer, you would find letters of admiration full of love and respect towards Yennekar. These were letters written to her by her family, her friends back in her hometown, academy alumni, and faculty members. Each letter was sincerely thankful. And each letter Yennekar had ever received, she had kept.But imagine this.Imagine Yennekar sitting there with her eyes closed.It was a spacious desk, and yet there was no room to properly open even one book.The letters that covered her wall weighed on her shoulders like bricks.Oh, but the solution was really simple. Everyone knew it.There was no need to treat every bit of sincerity and respect so seriously. It was important to know how to shake their weight off when they become too heavy to bear.If Yennekar took down all the supportive messages on her wall, and if put the sincere gifts that filled her desk somewhere in the corner of her room, and if she threw away all the letters that were too old to be needed\u2026 If she did\u2026But she hadn\u2019t.The fact that this was impossible for Yennekar to do was the start of her misfortune. It was her darkness.And Velosper latched onto that darkness.Yennekar Palerover was obsessed with giving the world all the sincerity and goodwill she could give at the same level of sincerity and goodwill she had received. She was truly like the main character in a fairytale.But that was a reckless point of view in life. No explanation needed.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThat knowledge alone was enough for me to know Yennekar\u2019s behavior that led to the finale happening a month earlier than the original timeline.The weight that was pulling her down had increased at a much faster rate than from the game.And if I were to think about the reason\u2026 it went all the way back to the Joint Battle Practice.The student who was supposed to receive the most attention from that class was Taylee, not Yennekar.It was an episode where both of them raised their reputation and became the two top students. Taylee, for winning his duel against Lucy, and Yennekar, for being the only second-year to win.However, since Lucy one-shotted Taylee into defeat, all the spotlight focused on Yennekar.And because the second-years were beyond frustrated by all their losses from the first-years, their expectations towards Yennekar exceeded that of a simple idol and almost entered the realm of religion.All in all, an unexpected variable at the beginning of the story ended up biting me in the ass and created another unexpected event in the end.The reason why all the attention was on Yennekar was because Lucy blew away Taylee in one shot.The reason why Lucy was able to one-shot Taylee was because she signed a contract with Merilda.The reason why Lucy was able to sign a contract with Merilda was because she had been going to the northern forest more than usual.The reason why Lucy had been visiting the northern forest more than usual was because she found a good place to take a nap there.And the reason there was a good place to take a nap was\u2026.It was because there was someone who got kicked out of their family at the start of Act 1 living there.Though the flapping of the butterfly wings was timid, the result became a hurricane.I couldn\u2019t even complain that it was too much.However, an involuntary sigh escaped my lips because the missing puzzle piece turned out to be different from what I had imagined.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *Something that had been bothering me for a long time had finally become clear. Why was Yennekar chosen as the first boss.The message of \u2018Silvenia\u2019s Failed Swordmaster\u2019 wasn\u2019t complicated at all.Yennekar Palerover was the opposite of the main character, Taylee McLaure.Taylee was someone who became stronger as time went on. There would be all sorts of agony and pain in his path but he would be able to overcome all these obstacles that stood in his way. He was that kind of main character.On the other hand, Yennekar lived a life opposite of Taylee\u2019s.She was born with good talent, was loved by her family, and received everyone\u2019s praises and warm sincerity. She was a girl who would never lose her smile.But she became the reason things turned out like this.I didn\u2019t know if there were actual people in the world who lived their life like a dramatic main character. Someone who overcame all sorts of hardships and achieved such dramatic success.People who live their life as supporting characters ultimately have to accept the consequences of failure despite receiving everyone\u2019s love and support. These people are who we call extras.Yennekar must have been chosen as the boss of Act 1 to show the dark side behind Taylee\u2019s actions. She was the antithesis to Taylee, the game\u2019s main character.And since she received that much attention during Act 1, it was no wonder she was chosen as the boss for it.However, the meaning hidden so deep like this\u2026 was just painful. What even was the point of all these obscurely hidden game elements?\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI involuntarily uttered words of admiration at the sight in front of me.Spirits had no concept of death. Cutting off the head of a manifestation would only release it, allowing it to return to its fluid state, their power significantly reduced. It would take a tremendous amount of time for them to recover.All this time, I hadn\u2019t seen a spirit with my own eyes. But looking around the training field right now, my eyes trained with enough Spirit Resonance\u2026 I could see the spirits hovering from all over the half-destroyed building. It was so beautiful with the sunlight shining down on them.With the\u00a0Berserk\u00a0magic lifted, all the spirits had begun to gather around Yennekar one by one, as if to comfort her.\u201cWhat will happen to me now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be sent to the Disciplinary Committee.\u201d\u201cWill I be\u2026 expelled?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201dShe didn\u2019t get expelled, as far as I knew, because her face showed up for a brief moment during the ending credits.However, what happened next to her from here on out was completely unknown territory.Yennekar was now a character who had come down from the stage. Someone who was now completely separated from the main scenario. A villain that no longer had a big impact on the main story. Pushed aside.The reason why that felt so familiar was because it wasn\u2019t exactly just someone else\u2019s story to me.\u201cThe fact that you were a victim taken over by Velosper would be taken into consideration to some extent.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cBut your crimes wouldn\u2019t be completely erased. Dean McDowell is the academy\u2019s head dean, and he tends to be pro-students so he wouldn\u2019t just carelessly expel the academy\u2019s second-year top student.\u201dThe second-years would be hopeless without Yennekar. So all the professors in charge of second-years would do their best to make sure she wasn\u2019t expelled.On top of that, she had a good reputation and was well-behaved. She had also contributed many things to the academy so the students would side with her. Probably even write a petition for her, if needed\u2026 If she was lucky, she would maybe end up with a probation or suspension at most. Though she was already quite lucky, if I were being honest.\u201cHey, Ed. Can I say something embarrassing?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI thought of something when the subjugation force arrived.\u201dAbove us, all of a sudden, the barrier began to break under the bright early morning sky. It sparkled as the sun rose from the east. It was quite a dazzling sight.\u201cI imagined that someone with overwhelming power would show up and take care of the entire situation, and he would run away holding my hand. Wouldn\u2019t it have been great if he could do everything so I wouldn\u2019t have to worry? And then he would kindly tell me that everything would be okay\u2026?\u201d\u201cWould such a thing even happen?\u201d\u201c...you're right. That\u2019s something that only happens in fairytales.\u201dYennekar let out a tiny laugh.Then, with a big smile on her face, she nodded her head, as if to say, \u2018Yeah.\u2019\u201cSomeday, by all means, please save Yennekar.\u201dThe wind wolf\u2019s message came to mind. It was a spirit that sincerely cared about and loved Yennekar.Though I didn\u2019t care about the message then, now that I thought about it, something felt strange.The fact that Yennekar would be taken over by Velosper and destory the academic district was future knowledge that only I knew.Even then, it asked me to save Yennekar, as if Merilda also knew about the future. But that couldn\u2019t be true though.Asking someone who knew about the future to save Yennekar was like asking them to take care of the ordeal that Yennekar was about to face.But Merilda\u2019s message shouldn\u2019t have had that intention.In other words, my information advantage had ended up giving me a role\u2026But, perhaps, Merilda had already noticed Yennekar\u2019s heavy heart then.But since giving encouragement, giving advice and being worried about her were poisonous acts towards Yennekar\u2026The more sincere someone was towards her, the heavier their sincerity became to her.What she needed was something light but not cold, like a warm drizzle of encouragement. Words that were more precious than gold.Everyone who loved Yennekar gave her their entire heart. Merilda must have come to the conclusion that a boy who had tried to push Yennekar away was more suitable to give her words of encouragement.It wanted Yennekar to have someone to rely on emotionally. Someone who didn\u2019t put pressure on her with a heavy heart.\u201cHey, Yennekar.\u201dAnd that\u2019s why I called out to her and told her,\u201cYou did great.\u201dWould my one message be enough to provide her the emotional support she needed?Yennekar forced out a smile as she quietly buried her face into her knees.In the end, Yennekar Palerover had failed.She tried to sign a contract with a new high-ranking spirit. But because she rushed the summoning ceremony, she ended up being taken over by a dark spirit and destroying the academic district.It was quite the massive failure. Something that would be too difficult to look past. In any case, her process and goal must have originally been sincere.Studying late into the night, training her magic power, smiling at her family, her classmates, and her teachers who sincerely supported her\u2026 she must have put a lot of energy and effort into meeting the expectations of these people.Since the process itself was beautiful, ironically, the failure was as well. I didn\u2019t know how comforting this thought was though.As if to comfort her, spirits flocked to Yenneka whose back was quietly shaking. They seemed to be trying to say that she had tried hard enough.Yennekar who would normally smile widely and hug the spirits\u2026 only for today, her shoulders shook without giving any response.The sun was setting. The stage had now moved onto the next act.Students cheered for the subjugation force as they returned victorious to the Student Square.The proud main characters walked up the stage as a round of applause and praises poured in.On the other hand, it was quiet and dark backstage. The Act 1 villain's exit was hidden by the main characters\u2019 grand success.Amidst the spirits, this girl who had experienced her first failure in life was left quietly sobbing.I didn\u2019t comfort or encourage her with all of my heart.That was the answer.Act 1.The first act of the game that I had repeated countless times.It felt like I had finally confirmed that this story arc had ended.* * *[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Ordinary MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700 Fast Casting Level 5\u0700 Mana Sense Level 6Fire Element Magic:\u0700 Ignite Level 12Wind Element Magic:\u0700 Wind Blade Level 11Spirit-type Magic:\u0700 Spirit Resonance Level 10\u0700 Spirit Understanding Level 10\u3008 New Spirit Slot: Empty \u3009\u3008 New Spirit Slot: Empty \u3009\u300a Low-ranking fire spirit Elgo has taken an interest in you. \u300b\u300a Low-ranking wind spirit Dries has taken an interest in you. \u300b\u300a High-ranking wind spirit Merilda has taken a strong interest in you. \u300b____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Yennekar Palerover (1)A gust of warm wind blew by.The warm sunlight tickled her skin as it came through the hidden flower garden deep in the lush forest.Yennekar sat there, picking flowers as she made a wreath. She had taken off her damaged academy uniform and had instead put on a comfortable beige skirt she used to wear back in her hometown. She carefully weaved the wreath together as she sang a beautiful tune.Suddenly, a boy arrived from the forest, riding a majestic white horse. He slowly dismounted from the saddle as the sounds of the horse's hooves clapping subsided.That boy was Ed Rothstaylor.Yennekar stood up with a big smile on her face as she welcomed Ed to the flower garden. Ed wore the flower wreath she had made and held her hand as they smiled at each other. Then the two of them began to dance.Hahaha\u2013Flower petals flew around them as the butterflies danced in the air. And as if the forest had blessed them, the trees moved out of their way to give them room as they moved.Hahahahaha\u2013Their steps were exactly in sync, as if they perfectly understood each other. The sound of an unknown lute and a harp resonated throughout the garden.It was truly a scene from a fairytale.Hahahaha\u2013Haha\u2013Ha\u2013....Chirp\u2013Chirp\u2013The chirps of the sparrows outside the Ophelis Hall windows tickled her ears. It was the sound of a new morning.Yennekar sat up.Her hair was a mess and her skin was a little bloated from last night's deep sleep. Yennekar buried her face into her pillow as she hugged it.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me\u2026 I\u2019m already this old but I\u2019m still having these types of dreams\u2026\u201dWaves of embarrassment and humiliation kept on crashing onto her as time passed by.* * *It was afternoon two days after when the disaster took place.\u201cClara, you know, why is the weight between liking someone and loving someone so different?\u201dClara was eating the tomatoes in her salad when Yennekar asked her the question. And Clara\u2019s expression, upon hearing it, grew serious. The same was true of their other friend, Anise. The two of them were Yennekar\u2019s best friends. They stopped playing with their forks and began to listen intently.It was lunchtime at the student cafeteria.Yennekar was the same as usual. She was out eating with her two best friends, having left the high-quality food of Ophelis Hall behind.Ten days have passed since Yennekar\u2019s Disciplinary Committee Hearing had been over.Not only did the three deans of each department attend, but Headmaster Obel was also in attendance. Their presence created a dreadful atmosphere as the hearing proceeded like a complete battlefield.Skipping the major events of the hearing would still take way too long to cover all that had happened.Yennekar had admitted to her wrongdoings and willingly accepted any punishment the committee would bestow her. She completely surrendered, white flag and all.However, the second-years and the professors in charge of them stood up for her, taking Yennekar\u2019s side during the first round of hearing. They attacked the student council and academic affairs\u2019 main office with petitions. A total of 1,417 copies were submitted, completely filling the academic proposal box that a separate collection box solely for petitions had to be brought in.During the second round of hearing, despite what Head Escort Claire had been telling her, Princess Penia declared that she would not charge Yennekar for the attempted murder of a member of the royal family. This was because she was deeply impressed by the students\u2019 petitions. And this particular decision by Princes Penia would be the fundamental cause of why she would receive overwhelming support from the second-years, helping her get elected as the student body president in the future.But that was a separate story from this one.The Academic Affairs Office also recognized the fact that Yennekar had not intended to do such actions as she was then taken over by Velosper. This had made the expulsion charges become invalid. However, that didn\u2019t mean that all of Yennekar\u2019s wrongdoings would simply disappear since her actions still left a lot of financial damages and injuries.This was where Lortel came in.Lortel would provide the funds to rebuild Nail Hall and Glockt Gall at a low interest rate. She would also subsidize all the sustained injuries completely free of charge. In exchange, she was able to negotiate half the customs fees on school supplies the Elte Company distributes to the business district. The leniency clause for Yennekar was just a bonus.Because of this, the Elte Company\u2019s products gained an absolute competitive edge in school supplies. This also earned them the status of proper creditors to the academy, rather than a simple sponsor. They even went as far as getting rid of the debt the promising elementalist, Yennekar Palerover, had.Lortel was someone who would never miss an opportunity. Head Dean McDowell couldn\u2019t help but front in front of Lortel on the day of the negotiation signing. But it was in Lortel\u2019s nature to answer him with a smile.While Penia and Lortel were adding chaos to the situation, the students were constantly running around and campaigning for a favorable hearing for Ynenekar.The final result ended up being a splendid feat.10 days of probation. 20 days of suspension. Removed from the Glockt Scholarship Foundation beneficiaries. Banned from entering Ophelis Hall starting next semester. Forfeit the benefits of being a top student. Return all academic honorary awards. And she won\u2019t be held back another year.The second-years jumped for joy and cheered. It was way more than they had hoped for. It felt like they were filming some type of emotional youth drama.However, behind the crowd of cheering students was Yennekar, still with her shoulders down. And none of them knew the reason why. Not a single one.\u201cWh-What\u2026 what are you saying all of a sudden?\u201dEither way, it was all in the past. It was meaningless to argue about it now. Clara was trying to help Yennekar not feel so down now that her probation period was over.The night before, Clara and Anise practiced what they would say and talk about with Yennekar after a long time of not seeing each other.They made sure to never mention the Glasskan incident. They also made sure to pretend they didn't care and to never mention how they felt about it. And since it had been a while since they met up together, they decided to get lunch and catch up on each other's personal matters.But they had already discussed everything they could talk about. Assistant Professor Cleoh tripped over while distributing test papers. The morning glory that had begun to bloom in a corner of the Defense Magic Training Center had now begun to wrap itself around the outer wall. The egg tarts from the bakery downtown that were so delicious everyone was fussing about them. Clara and Anise had prepared these sorts of topics.\u201cWhat\u2026 what does love really mean? It's a lot heavier than just the feeling of liking someone, right? That's what the dictionary says as well. And that's how I've been using it too. But\u2026 that difference in weight comes from our emotions\u2026 and the weight of our emotions depends on the person\u2026\u201d\u201cYennekar, wait a sec. Here, just eat this.\u201d\u201cHm? Hahaha, sorry.\u201dClara smiled as she took a bite of her tomato. She kept watching Yennekar with a smile on her face.But a cold sweat had already begun to run down the edge of her neck. And looking at Anise, the same looked to be true for her as well. They were maintaining a poker face with superhuman mental strength, but this conversation had already become a catastrophic ordeal.Yennekar had begun to sound like some philosopher. And out of all the topics she could be discussing\u2026 it turned out to be love. She was seriously contemplating the difference between actually loving someone and just liking someone.Clara and Anise had been really worried about how Yennekar was feeling. The image of her sitting in her room in Ophelis Hall, looking out the window, kept lingering in their minds. They didn\u2019t know what she could be thinking all alone in such a lonely place, extremely worried that she could be suffering from the guilt and taking on that burden all by herself. Fortunately, it seemed that Yennekar was free of such guilt.Ten days was not a short time. For the first two to three days, maybe even up to a week, they were worried that her heart would be aching and bruised but she seemed to have recovered to some extent, which was a relief.However, what they weren\u2019t expecting was\u00a0this.For Yennekar to suddenly be troubled by love\u2026 suddenly discussing the word felt like a precursor to a greater event that could have an unbelievable ripple effect.Slam!Claire unconsciously slammed her fork down the table. Yennekar, who was biting her sandwich, flinched in surprise.Clara got up from her chair and looked around, her expression serious. There weren\u2019t many students left in the cafeteria because lunchtime was nearly over. That was a relief, at least. This meant nobody nearby was listening. And since Yennekar didn\u2019t have anyone to properly talk to during her probation period, then she hadn\u2019t been able to talk to anyone about this topic apart from them.Clara sat down again, her mindset. She made eye contact with her reliable friend Anise next to her. Clara swallowed and nodded. In that brief glance, it felt like they\u2019d exchanged a whole conversation between them.\u201cSo\u2026?\u201dThe innocence of this girl needed to be protected. Clara and Anise had been putting enough effort this far and had overcome every single crisis without failure. Whenever Yennekar was about to get hurt or have a difficult time, they would always jump in and shield her from all the hardships that the world had to offer.They had protected Yennekar from the upperclassmen who were jealous of herThey had also protected her from an assistant professor who didn\u2019t like her because she was always favored and protected by her classmates.They even protected her from Ed Rothstaylor who was clearly one of the worst people in the entire world.And even though there had been some groundless rumors about the first-years about how Ed was just \u2018a rude punk that was actually more competent than one would think\u2019, they didn\u2019t want to be too quick to trust. His personality was definitely arrogant and wrong in the first place, and that was a fact.Clara and Anise couldn\u2019t let such risk factors approach Yennekar.\u201cWhy are you suddenly talking about that, Yennekar\u2026?\u201dClara was in control of the conversation. She brought up the topic with a strong heart. Anise, who was still struggling to manage her expressions, needed a bit more time to calm down.They need to carefully uncover this topic so as not to hurt Yennekar who had an extremely sensitive heart.The love story of Yennekar Palerover. Bad news would travel fast. If such a bomb of a rumor went off among the students, it would spread quickly. Every student would probably already know by tomorrow morning\u2019s assembly.Just how much damage would that bring to Yennekar\u2019s weak heart?Clara clenched her teeth and shook her head, wholeheartedly of the belief that she needed to stop it.Yennekar slowly began to talk.\u201cActually, about that\u2026 I heard this from a friend not too long ago\u2026\u201dNo! Yennekar!You had been stuck in your room for the past ten days so you definitely didn\u2019t meet anyone! Who in their right mind would believe that\u2026?!Clara barely held herself back from screaming.\u201cO-Oh. So\u2026 what did that friend of yours say?\u201d\u201cWhile she was mindlessly staring off into space in her room, suddenly, someone\u2019s face came to mind\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my! Would you look at that? I must have lost my mind! I promised to help Assistant Professor Cleoh this afternoon! I had completely forgotten! Sorry! I\u2019ll go first! Bye, see you next time!\u201dAnise had already decided that this was the best decision for her to make as she could barely keep her straight face for much longer.Clara looked at Anise, remembering their promise together, but when she saw Anise\u2019s entire face had gone red, even up to her ears, Clara had no choice but to let her friend go. Anise was no longer in a state where she was able to fight.A comrade had died.Everything was left to Clara now.The usually innocent Yennekar. That Yennekar was now a deadly poison to Clara\u2019s heart.She was already at her limit. She bit her tongue, holding back on asking all the questions she was dying to know: Who was the other person? Where did they meet? Why did her heart change towards him? When was there an opportunity for this? What will actually happen in the future?Clara\u2019s spirit and tenacity were that of a mighty general running through a field of arrows alone.Yennekar\u2019s innocence must be maintained. The faint memories of her first love should be a beautiful memory, not a shameful dark history.\u201cAnd\u2026 that person kept appearing in her dreams\u2026\u201d\u201cIs-Is that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. I heard there were even dreams where they were dancing together\u2013 or were they playing? In a flower garden. So\u2026 uh, what do you think\u2026?\u201dThe corners of Yennekar\u2019s lips were trying to form a smile. Clara seriously thought about grabbing a fork and jamming it into her thigh.\u201cSo that\u2019s what I\u2013 no, I mean that\u2019s what\u00a0she\u00a0said\u2026 about\u2026 uh, yeah\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I see\u2026 That\u2019s quite interesting\u2026 I don\u2019t think there is a reason, you know? When someone likes or hates someone else, there is always some type of reason.\u201d\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201dClara ended up saying some heartfelt words that were stuck in the back of her throat.In an instant, she felt like a parent sending her daughter off to get married and her imagination played a reel of some third-rate novel unfolding. But Clara knew all too well that that was a waste of time.Yennekar wanted to hide her love story. If Clara rushed her to uncover it, Yennekar would only end up getting hurt.Clara\u2019s heart as Yennekar\u2019s best friend was currently in a head-to-head fight with her heart as a girl curious about a friend\u2019s love story.This was more painful than running around on two legs to get favorable results for the disciplinary committee hearing.However, what was the most important thing in all of this? Yennekar herself, that\u2019s who.As she had been saying all this time, she needed to protect her purity and innocence. Clara took a deep breath and regained her composure.Plaster on a refreshing smile and\u2013\u201cYennekar, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re worried about this too much? Whether you like or hate someone, it\u2019s not as straight-cut as you might think.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. Sometimes, you might hate someone simply because of their attitude, and sometimes you may really like them because they were by your side when you were having a hard time or when you were happy. That\u2019s just how humans work. I don\u2019t think you need to worry about this too much.\u201dFinding the reason why we like or hate someone should be left to scholars in fields such as psychology and philosophy.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to put those complicated feelings aside and just be honest with your current feelings\u2013 No, I mean your\u00a0friend\u2019s\u00a0feelings. Wouldn\u2019t that be better for her?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 yeah. I think you\u2019re right. Ha\u2026 as expected of you, Clara.\u201dSeeing Yennekar smiling like so, it felt like a knife was stuck in Clara\u2019s heart.\u201cAlthough\u2026 Yennekar. Thinking from your friend\u2019s point of view, I don\u2019t think they would like it very much if their sensitive concerns were circling among their friends, don\u2019t you think? I think it\u2019s better that you thought about it on your own rather than getting advice from others.\u201dClara had just blocked the possibility of rumors spreading in advance. She was the type of person to say such things straight to the point.\u201cShould I not? But that friend\u2026 she\u2026 I don\u2019t think she cares about that sort of thing\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Yennekar. Even if that was the case, talking about such sensitive concerns to friends\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be good for your reputation.\u201d\u201cOh.. oh! You\u2019re right! You\u2019re not disappointed in me, are you, Clara?\u201dYennekar was such a lovely girl. Clara had to swipe her hand over her face before regaining her composure.\u201cIt's fine, Yennekar\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat. Anyways, thanks for giving me such meaningful advice. I should go back to Ophelis Hall and report on my suspension period.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll sit here for a bit more before I go. I have something to think about\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay! It\u2019s been so long. It\u2019s a relief to see that you\u2019re doing well. See you again after the disciplinary period is over, Clara!Yennekar left the cafeteria after saying goodbye.Clara put her face on the table after a while.I did it, Anise.She had lost every bit of strength throughout her entire body.Clara ended up staying still for a while, recovering her energy.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 7Intelligence: 7Dexterity: 9Willpower: 8Luck: 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226bI was heading back to the northern forest with my shiny new chainsaw, hammer, and a bunch of nails. I used some of the gold I had and bought some new tools to build my cabin. Now that I\u2019m done with the groundwork and all the preparations were complete, it was time to come into actually building the main body.My Intelligence had gone up by two levels the night the Glasskan subjugation took place.It was a stat that hadn\u2019t gone up for months no matter how much I studied magic and whine about it. The fact that it progressed as much was enough to make me emotional.In addition, my\u00a0Spirit Understanding\u00a0and\u00a0Spirit Resonance\u00a0jumped all the way to level 10 and opened up spirit slots. I was now able to use spirit skills and could even sign a contract with a high-ranking wind spirit.Of course, it would be too much to sign a contract with a high-ranking spirit right now given my stats, but Merilda wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Once I was able to raise my magic skills a bit more, I would call on Merilda and sign one.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cYour recommendation letter from Princess Penia had been confirmed. The Glockt Foundation provides many benefits. We\u2019ll do our best to be considerate of the student\u2019s opinion-\u201d\u201cA scholarship.\u201d\u201cFinancial support may be important for you, but first, why don\u2019t you listen to our explanation of the other benefits that-\u201d\u201cA scholarship.\u201d\u201cOur foundation provides academic support, preferential benefits when using living facilities, additional points for academic service scores, and most importantly, qualification to move to a better dormitory.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 fair kingdom my ass\u2026 never mind, just give me the scholarship.\u201dWhatever the benefits might be, they would all be meaningless if my name was not on the school register.Princess Penia had recognized my contribution during the subjugation and had given me a recommendation letter to the academic council and the Glockt Scholarship Foundation, just as she had promised.There wasn\u2019t any reason to reject this windfall so I clenched my teeth and received by exemption from next semester\u2019s full tuition payment.It had earned me some time to focus on training. It was such a relief.After such a disastrous night, the second act of the game had begun.I held the woodworking tools in my arm as I walked back to the northern forest.The flow of Act 2 was already playing out in my head.A battle of nerves between the Elte Company and the Academic Affairs over a purchase ware.What was interesting about Act 2 was that \u2018Golden King Elte\u2019, who had exuded the aura of being the act\u2019s final boss, was, in fact, just a fake boss. Elte would be kicked out of the story after his adopted daughter Lortel would stab him in the back at about the mid-to-late part of the act, and then the spotlight would move to the true hidden boss - \u2018Inquirer Glast\u2019.Glast was the senior professor in charge of the first-year students. He was not an easy opponent. Taylee still had quite a long way to go before he could even defeat the mid-boss to reach Glast. In Act 2, unlike in the first act, there were three mid-bosses.\u2018The Decoy Totte,\u2019 \u2018Maid Elris\u2019 and \u2018Golden Daughter Lortel.\u2019As the act progressed and each chapter and event happened, the three of them were given different roles. But among them, Lortel\u2019s arc was the one that stood out the most.She would later become the hidden heroine, but for Act 2, she was nothing but an overwhelming evil villain that made you hate her.Lortel had lived her life understanding and calculating profit while taking every opportunity that came her way. She used every single thing that she could get her hands on. She was a terrible villain who controlled the market, a merchant full of greed who did nothing but weigh her profits. In the end, she even ended up using her stepfather who had adopted her and had used her as well. She was someone who had truly lived a life of dark reality, her actions showing that she had been walking down a thorny road.Anyway, I learned a lesson during the Glasskan Subjugation chapter. I needed to carefully and consistently judge to make sure that the story was following the original timeline well or not.I wouldn\u2019t know how certain variables would change things, so, at the very least, I needed to do my utmost best to make sure I was not involved in any way so as not to ruin things.I mean, I was already busy taking care of my own life as it was.\u201cOh?\u201dI saw Yennekar in the distance as I passed by Ophelis Hall.Come to think of it, it was about time her probation period came to an end. All that was left was the suspension period. She must have wanted to get some fresh air.Now that I thought about it, I didn\u2019t have much of an opinion on Yennekar after Act 1.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt would be a bit awkward to pretend that we were close all of a sudden when I was openly trying to distance myself from her.But Yennekar had already completed her role and exited the main stage. She no longer had a significant impact on the main story. Right now, her importance didn\u2019t differ much from that of a senior maid.In order to live well in this world, there were many things I needed to do and accomplish such as train myself, obtain a good degree, and create a better living environment for myself.However, among the many types of assets there were, there was a unique power that could never be replaced. And that was personal connections.If I thought about it, Yennekar was such a promising figure that Elte Company had taken action and cleared all her debts. After she graduates from Silvenia with her degree, she could very well become quite an amazing individual.Furthermore, since she was already off the main story anyway, wouldn\u2019t it be okay for me to try and connect with her at this point?If there was anything I was nervous about right now, it was Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s changed evaluation. Among the main characters, there seemed to be some people who were highly evaluating me unnecessarily. The rumors circulating among the first-years had now upgraded me to a rude punk but with something else going on for me.But it was a completely separate matter what the second-years thought.Yennekar must have heard quite a bit of gossip about me today. And I was in an environment where my reputation could be flipped over at any time.Although Yennekar wasn\u2019t the type of person to be swayed by rumors like that. She usually treated me well.Wouldn\u2019t it be alright to say hello and try to become close? I didn\u2019t think it would be easy to have a chance to connect with someone like Yennekar.\u201cAlright\u2026\u201dI nodded as I walked towards Yennekar, who was slowly walking towards Ophelis Hall.\u201cHey, Yennekar. I guess your probation just finished?\u201dI casually greeted her.It would be normal for her to receive such a sudden greeting. After all, she was an idol loved by everyone in our year.Once she receives my greeting cheerfully, we could probably make some small talk about our personal stories superficially, then maybe say goodbye in just as cheerful a manner. Then I could return to going about my own business.I waited for her response as I drew out the plan in my head.\u201cUhm, yeah! Hm!\u201dBut as soon as our eyes met, Yennekar took a step back, tightly gripping her oak wand.\u201cYeah, Ed! Hmmm!\u201dShe looked like she had a hard time processing something. I couldn\u2019t even maintain eye contact with her as she kept looking everywhere else, rolling her eyes about, as if she had overloaded.\u201cI\u2019m..! I\u2019m going to Ophelis Hall! Something to do! See you next time! Bye!\u201dThen she ran away, as if she was afraid to talk to me any longer.Uh\u2026.?Now even Yennekar, who was such a rare saint, was cutting me off. Quite the amazing achievement, I must say.Rumors were seriously scary. But I could understand.No matter how strong her willpower was, she was bound to be swayed by these rumors, as they get repeated over such a long period of time. The power of a royal was indeed powerful.It felt terrible to lose the chance to establish a connection with such a great person. Although, I wasn\u2019t that badly insulted or depressed over it. I just couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. But hey, what could I do?I nodded my head in resignation and silently mourned my first-class human connection flying away from me.I won\u2019t be too clingy. Eat well and live long, Yennekar\u2026I gathered the materials I needed for the construction of my cabin and went on my way. Since the basic design work was completed, this was now a good opportunity to train my production skills.Now that I had more time on my hands\u2026 it was time to train some more.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Yennekar Palerover (2)The smell of gold coins.Lortel\u2019s sense of smell had always relentlessly caught the scent of money.She was at Tricks Hall, where faculty offices were located \u2013 the heart of the academic district.Outside, the building was made of neatly stacked black and red bricks, antique marble decor adorning the exterior. Regardless of what time it was, the glass windows were always spotless. The entrance to the hall was magnificent, always guarded by men on watch. There were also two extra guards watching the gate out back.It was where people who wielded administrative power and were at the top of the administrative system were. This was where people who made the final decisions stayed, along with people who managed the academy's finances, those who drafted the curriculum and schedules, those who reviewed student complaints, and those who decided on academic policies. Headmaster Obel and Assistant Headmaster Rachel's offices were located here.It was a place that very few students came to. Most of the people around were general faculty, professors, or outsourced personnel. Students were already busy studying as it were, they wouldn't have had a reason to visit the administrative building in the first place.Lortel smiled at the personnel guarding the entrance as she moved toward the lobby.The smell of gold coins irritated her nose. And walking into the main lobby finally revealed its source.At the center of the Tricks Hall lobby was the academy\u2019s treasure, encased in a glass display to show it off.It wasn't anything fancy. It was just a magic book that looked worn out, burned here and there.It was called the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019. And whoever it may be, they would be unable to help but thickly swallow at the name alone.It was the record of the academy\u2019s founder, Silvenia Robester. The person who had explored and discussed \u2018Celestial Magic\u2019.Celestial Magic predicted the flow of the stars and used that power to twist the providence of the world itself. It was known to be the most incomprehensible and profound branch of magic.Numerous researchers had tried to interpret and reproduce the records within that seal, but no study had ever been completed. It was a book that remained the ultimate challenge for academia.But aside from its academic value, the book was also a symbol of Silvenia Academy.The book had a fixed schedule for when it would come out of its glass case. It only ever left it when it was needed to study Celestial Magic, and for public events such as the entrance ceremony for new students, inauguration ceremonies for the student council or the headmaster, as well as for year-end graduation ceremonies.\u201cHmmm~\u201dLortel stood in front of the display as she took a deep breath, eyes looking at the Sage\u2019s Seal.\u201cIt really does smell like money.\u201dLortel whispered softly with a nonchalant smile.That book was the trigger that signaled the events of the second arc.The heart of Silvenia Academy.The Sage\u2019s Seal.And the first purchase target for the Elte Company.* * *[ Life Skills Details ]Grade: Beginner CraftsmanSpecialized Fields: Woodworking\u0700 Handicraft Level 10\u0700 Design Level 4\u0700 Collecting Skills Level 8\u0700 Woodworking Level 10\u0700 Hunting Level 7\u0700 Fishing Level 6\u0700 Cooking Level 5\u0700 Repair Level 5In my box were a saw, a hammer, a sharp ax, a sword used in place of a machete, and a bunch of nails thrown about at the bottom. It was less than one gold coin, all in all.Silvenia was an educational facility. I was worried they wouldn\u2019t be selling such woodworking items in the business district. Luckily, I was able to get a lot of quality items from the Elte Company\u2019s store. They sold everything.I sat on a log bench, stretching my body here and there.The Act 1 finale was now over. For the time being, there shouldn\u2019t be anything important happening in the main story.I didn\u2019t have to worry about the tuition fee until next semester. This left me with more time to train my body and make an effort to improve my standard of living.Act 2 would officially start come second semester. There was an end-of-semester evaluation episode before it but nothing big was set to happen there.Taylee would start to genuinely raise his grades and learn how to use\u00a0Wind Slash\u00a0or other such skills as\u00a0Elemental Slash. It was just a filler episode. Originally, it should have taken place before the Glasskan Subjugation but here we are.Vacation came after the closing ceremony. I could then spend all my time tending to my camp. I shouldn\u2019t waste such a golden opportunity.But more than anything, I needed to solve the safety issues of my living area first.I reviewed the design structure of the cabin I had mapped out in my head and nodded. It would\u2019ve been great had I drawn out a proper blueprint. But then again, even if I were, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to follow it as much. Immediate problems could only be solved by improvising and building as similarly as possible.Either way, it shouldn\u2019t matter if it were a little crude. It wasn\u2019t like I was going to sell it anyway.Life would be a lot harder for me for now than it had been compared to when I just started living out here. The good news was that every bit of hard work I put in would become the basis of my growth, so it wasn\u2019t like I was going to be blindly suffering.And this body had a natural talent for production. Somehow, I thought, it should all work out.It didn\u2019t provide much comfort but\u2026 I should work as much as I could and increase my proficiency level.Yeah. With that thought in mind, I stood up and held a sword.Then I marked the trunk of a large oak tree nearby with a horizontal stroke.Today was the first day I was constructing my cabin.Day 1I decided where I would build my cabin.My current camp was a little too close to the river right now. It would be catastrophic were the river to overflow.I chose a space that was moderately shady, large, and inconspicuous. I then proceeded to flatten the land.I removed all the trees and large stones that were in the way and flattened anywhere that was slightly sloped with my shovel.After I was done with the base groundwork, it was already time to sleep. I checked how much food I had left first. I noticed I was starting to slowly run out so I decided to restock tomorrow. After I had decided to go hunt the next day, I fell asleep memorizing the major events in history for my upcoming Magic History written exam.Day 3I started to collect the wood I would need. The proficiency level of my\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0was quite high now so it was relatively easy to do. However, using magic too much would affect my Vitality so I made sure to do it in moderation.But no matter, because trimming the wood ended up being harder than cutting them down. I had no way to mass-produce neatly standardized planks. I had to manually peel the bark off each tree one by one\u2026 and cut them one by one.Removing the twigs off, peeling off its bark, and turning it into lumber took more than two hours each. Looked like I would be working on them for quite some time.Another notable thing that happened was I met Yennekar but she ignored me again. Her friends Clara and Anise looked quite smug as she ran away from me without so much as a glance. They were smiling snidely, as if to tell me I shouldn't ever think of getting close to their friend for even a second. Well, it wasn't like I was planning to, anyway.Day 6I started to experience some muscle pain from working on the wood for quite a while now.It had been a while since I set up camp here in the northern forest. I thought I had gotten used to walking every morning and using my body to do strenuous physical activities every day, but my body had been screaming at me ever since I started building my cabin. I decided to endure it though. Because I knew that this would all benefit me in the end anyway.Day 11I was able to stick up on a bit of food but I still had a long way to go.I met a low-ranking wind spirit that looked like a sparrow while walking around the forest with my saw. Just in case, I asked if Merilda was uncomfortable with me violently cutting down all these trees. However, the spirit only turned its head the other way. Well, I guess the spirit was more generous than I thought.I debated if I should sign a contract with the spirit but I didn't want to unnecessarily waste one of my two spirit slots just like that.Day 14End-of-semester evaluations were coming up so I decided to stop working on the wood for the time being.I spent most of my nights invested in my studies. I was quite confident with my written knowledge but I felt that my practical skills were still lacking and I needed to train some more.Despite that, I knew my magic skills had come a long way compared to when I started. I was now more skilled than an average first-year student.I met Yennekar in front of the exam center at the academic district but she just ignored me again. Beside her, Clara and Anise looked quite satisfied at her non-reaction.Day 18I was almost done preparing the wood I'd need. Although they might still not be enough, I could just go out and make some more if I needed them.The closing ceremony was just ahead. My grade came out well. Not enough to receive a scholarship but as long as I kept growing at this pace, I could try again next semester.Wind Blade\u00a0had also risen a level. It was already a level 11 which was already quite high to begin with. But using it to cut down trees and removing twigs every day seemed to have trained it enough to increase it by another one.I didn't have any means to move the wood planks I had made, so I ended up borrowing a wheelbarrow from the ongoing Student Center construction site. It wasn\u2019t for free, of course. After paying for it, they allowed me to use it for as much as I wanted as long as they didn't need it.So I gathered and transferred every wood I processed one by one and moved them near my camp.Day 20Vacation had finally started. This meant I would be able to spend my entire days here at camp in the meantime.Most of the students went back to their hometowns. But since I didn't have any hometown to return to, I planned to use this time to start building my cabin.First, I used\u00a0Wind Blade\u00a0to cut the logs in half and use the flat surface to act as beams for my cabin. I only managed to get halfway done after working all day.When it was time to stock up on food, I checked the snare trap I set up the other day but found Lucy caught in it instead, sound asleep. I shouldn't have used jerky as bait\u2026 it was a mistake.I threw Lucy into the shelter and went back to work on the beams.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *Day 23Ziggs wandered into my part of the forest. He said he was jogging around as part of his training.I asked why he didn't go home this vacation and he said that since Elka couldn't go due to her academic work, he decided not to go back home as well. He was the same as always.He saw me building my shabby-looking cabin and asked if he could help.I considered rejecting his offer since I was building my cabin as part of my training, but then I thought it was better to get help with the things I couldn\u2019t handle by myself.He ended up helping me erect and fix a central pillar and four outer pillars. We also finished working on setting up the beams needed. We finished the hard work sweating like crazy on the floor.Ziggs went back to Ophelis Hall as it began to get dark out. He told me to let him know if I needed any more help later on.Day 27It was raining. The timbers were soaked with rainwater, making them too heavy to work with. And since they would need a day or two to dry, I thought I should focus on my other tasks in the meantime.Senior Maid Bell Maya came by at night and gave me some herbs and mushrooms. She asked me how things had been with Yennekar so I gave her an honest answer and told her it seemed like Yennekar now hated me.Bell only tilted her head in response. Afterwhich, she returned back to Ophelis Hall.Yennekar and her best friends seemed to also be staying at the academy this vacation.Day 30The shape of my cabin was beginning to come together with the beams and pillars installed in place. The next step was to stack up the logs I cut to build the outer walls.I couldn't just stack them on top of each other, of course. I had to cut out a little bit at the end of each piece of wood to act as a joint.It was like hell. Saw, chisel, hammer\u2026 just to cut out the joint so the wood would all fit together. I felt like I was going to lose my mind.But in the end, it all came together pretty well.Day 32The outer wall I had previously stacked together had collapsed around one of the pillars. I realized matching the joints together wasn't strong enough to hold the whole structure together.What a disaster.Day 34I came up with an idea to hold everything together. I would drill a hole in each piece of wood and then insert a sturdy iron rod into each joint. I went back to the general store run by the Elte Company and bought the necessary materials.I ran into Yennekar and her friends by the bakery while I was downtown. And like always, Yennekar ran away the moment our eyes met. I expected her friends to laugh at me with a satisfied look on their faces but it was only Anise who laughed.Clara looked at me, then at Yennekar, and began to sweat.Oh well. Guess she had a stomach ache.Day 37\u201cYou were right. It was just like you said. Taylee isn\u2019t half bad.\u201dStacking the logs all the way to the top and working on the roof were jobs too difficult to do alone, so I ended up calling Ziggs over when I saw him jogging by for some help.I had changed my mind these days. While it wasn\u2019t a good idea to get too involved with the important characters, if I were too far away from them, it would be too impossible for me to know how the story was progressing compared to the original timeline. I couldn\u2019t let the same mistake happen again. Which was why I decided to know about the going-ons of the other first-years from Ziggs.We were sitting on the roof of the half-finished cabin, drilling a nail into each joint.\u201cI dueled with him during the end-of-semester evaluation, and during the fight, he never gave up but kept on getting stronger instead. He was still no match to me, of course, but he might become quite a good swordsman in the future.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dI was able to confirm that Act 1 Chapter 9 was proceeding without any issues.\u201cDo we need to nail this down too?\u201d\u201cYou can leave that side. I\u2019m going to put a chimney there.\u201dAlthough my cabin was quite shabby, I planned to build a chimney for my fireplace. A space for smoke to escape was needed when heating the cabin. This required more materials aside from the logs I had cut but I would cross that bridge when I got there.Day 40Vacation was already halfway through. I took the day off because it was too hot out. I thought I would even suffer from a heatstroke.Day 42I worked with my top off because it was too hot out. The fine growing muscles that had covered my body had now upgraded to just being called muscles.Whenever it got too hot, I jumped into the river and collected mud to fill the gaps between the logs. Since the roof may leak, I also treated it the same way and then covered it with the large leaves I had used to make my wooden shelter. I also used the leftover net to tie everything down.I tied the little bit of the remaining net I had to a nearby tree to make a hammock. If I needed it for something else later, I could always just take it down.Day 45...In front of me\u2026Was my well-made cabin, welcoming me in.[ Newly Crafted Product ]Log CabinAfter the logs were trimmed down to a uniform size, they were stacked together according to the pillars and beams built into the foundation.It only has outer walls and a roof.There is nothing inside.Production Difficulty Level: \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u300a Production completed.

Production skills have increased. \u300b\u201cPheww\u2026\u201dI sighed and threw my ax on the ground.I then walked slowly towards my cabin. It didn\u2019t have a door yet, but I could use my suitcase\u2019s hinges and attach one in the future.I passed through the threshold and sat in the middle of it.It seemed to be a little bit more than 17 square meters. The logs I used were larger than I thought so it came out bigger than I expected. Not that that was a bad thing since now it just meant that it was wider. Although I suspect I would have trouble with heating the whole place but hey, it was nothing unacceptable.I also saved a space for a window but hadn\u2019t actually attached one just yet. There was also a space for a fireplace but I had no materials to make a stove right now so it was still left empty for the time being.I still had no flooring, nor had I insulated the walls. And there was no furniture. None at all. It was just a cabin simply made out of logs.But at least it has walls and a roof.If I installed a door, then no bugs would be able to come in. And if I get a light source inside, then it would be comfortable to study at night.Oh, and it would be perfect if I could find a desk and a chair. Or make them.I wiped the sweat off my face.I had a house.That simple fact felt especially touching, as it was proof of how hard I\u2019ve had it thus far.I had been trying so hard to just survive day by day that I had completely forgotten about how important this was. It wasn\u2019t until I had my own living space that I realized it.I decided to take it easy for now and just sit back as the day came to an end.[ Life Skills Details ]Grade: Beginner CraftsmenSpecialized Fields: Woodworking\u0700 Handicraft Level 13\u0700 Design Level 8\u0700 Collecting Skills Level 11\u0700 Woodworking Level 12\u0700 Hunting Level 8\u0700 Fishing Level 6\u0700 Cooking Level 6\u0700 Repair Level 5The completed cabin even had a level four production difficulty.I had delayed checking my Life Production Skills and my Dexterity stat, both of which had been rising like crazy. Even my Vitality stat had risen doing so much manual labor the past few days.My Advanced Production Skills would actually be unlocked soon\u2026 but I somehow didn\u2019t feel like checking them right now.I still had a long way to go.It would be a good idea to start getting the materials for the inner walls, flooring, some furniture, the fireplace, a fence, some extra food items, and maybe even a small warehouse to store firewood and some junk. I also had to install a door and a window.But for now\u2026 I just wanted to be underneath this roof, enclosed within these walls.And just like that, I stayed still in the middle of my cabin for a long time.\u201cOhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!\u201dIt was Lucy.She was hanging off from the windowless cut out in the wall and kicking her feet in the air, stars shooting from her eyes.This cabin, which was the product of my hard work, probably just looked like a huge cat tower to her. She started climbing up all over the roof, overly excited.I was thinking of kicking her out but\u2026 I still wanted to sit in this sense of accomplishment for a while more.Over the horizon, the sun was just beginning to set.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Yennekar Palerover (3)Senior Maid Bell was rumored to be the best and most reliable among the elite maids of Ophelis Hall.She had authority over the other maids. She was in charge of educating the newly hired maid. She would even scold them.Everyone had been speculating who would be next in line to Head Maid Elris, the current head maid and general manager of Ophelis Hall who was currently rumored to retire soon. The most likely candidate was actually Bell Maya.\u201cMs. Yennekar.\u201dBell was already treated with more respect than the other maids of Ophelis Hall, but that didn\u2019t mean her work differed from theirs because of her elevated status.Lower-ranked maids tended to the dirty and vulgar chores around the dormitory. They must also always be ready at a moment\u2019s notice for an order, making them ultimately responsible to take care of most things at Ophelis Hall.This also applied to dressing the students. Usually, senior maids barely did these types of tasks themselves, but Bell would still roll up her sleeves and do them herself.Just like this, Bell was combing Yennekar\u2019s hair in front of the mirror when she casually brought up a certain topic.\u201cI went to young master Ed\u2019s camp last time I went to the forest and saw something quite amazing.\u201d\u201cHm? Oh\u2026 You must mean the cabin?\u201d\u201c\u2026how did you know about it?\u201dYennekar shrugged as she began twisting the ends of her hair.\u201cI\u2026 I saw it while passing by.\u201d\u201cI see. He said he made it himself but I was quite surprised. It was much more impressive than I had thought. I had no idea he had quite the talent when it comes to that kind of thing.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cI wanted to look inside but I refrained from doing so. I was worried it might seem too inappropriate to ask. I wanted to look around and see how sturdy it was.\u201d\u201cI guess even someone like you wonders about that kind of thing.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m also human. Being curious is only natural.\u201dBell was the perfect maid. She was someone who really understood the meaning of serving someone else. She was never satisfied with just cleaning and doing her errands well.Doing everything for the person they are serving to their utmost ability, all without being too presumptuous \u2013 that was the true quality of a maid.\u201cWouldn\u2019t anyone who walks by and stumbles across that cabin be curious as to who built it, how did they build it, and what was inside? Such curiosity is a totally natural reaction to have.\u201dStrangely, Bell kept on bringing up the words \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018obvious\u2019, as if she had a hidden agenda. Yennekar felt like she was being pushed. She had also wanted to visit Ed\u2019s camp and see him. She also wanted to talk about things as well.But of course, such thoughts as doubting others\u2019 kindness or trying to guess their true intentions\u2026 there was no way Yennekar would think as such. To answer, Yennekar just nodded her head.\u201cI see. You\u2019re right. Of course, it was only natural. Seeing such a thing, of course, you couldn\u2019t help but be curious.\u201dYennekar accepted what Bell said with a serious face.Behind her, Bell let out a sigh of relief as she braided Yennekar\u2019s hair. It was only natural for a girl Yennekar\u2019s age to have feelings of affection and longing, but things would go well for her if she was this clumsy.Of course, to meddle any more than this would be too much so all Bell could do for now was trim Yennekar\u2019s hair as prettily as possible.For today, Bell used a bit more strength in her hands as she quietly brushed Yennekar\u2019s hair.The entrance to the northern forest was the same as always. The green vegetation was spread out, as if welcoming everyone to come inside.The entrance felt rather warm rather than dark despite the sun setting over the horizon. This was because of the fact that for Yennekar, the northern forest was a place she often visited whenever she needed to take a breather.She particularly enjoyed sitting down and leaning on The Guardian Tree of Merilda while she read books and enjoyed the breeze, the sound of the leaves swaying around her. It reminded her of sitting on a hill back in her hometown, the wind whistling past her ears.That was why she always visited this forest whenever she felt even a little bit homesick.However, she hadn\u2019t been able to enter the northern forest recently.She was ashamed to admit the reason herself, that it was because there was a high chance she would run into someone, that someone being a student who lived in the forest.It started with simple curiosity.The wind spirit Merilda, who was guarding the forest, would occasionally transform into a small fox whenever she had the time and come out of the forest to visit Yennekar and chat with her.They would sit by the windowsill in the moonlight late at night, chatting. For Yennekar, ending the day like that had become part of her norm.The Ed Rothstaylor that Merilda spoke of was much different from the rumors she\u2019d heard. Hearing his struggles just to survive in the forest, he sounded like some wild animal.He got an upset stomach after eating the bark of a tree, his wooden shelter kept on collapsing on him, and how he tied his hair while chopping up firewood. Yennekar couldn\u2019t stop laughing when she heard these stories.When he caught and cooked his first fish with the fishing rod he worked so hard to make, when he completed making the durable drying rack, even when he first succeeded in hunting small animals using his handmade bow\u2026 Yennekar couldn\u2019t help but proudly smile at hearing these stories.She enjoyed sitting by the windowsill and listening to all of Merilda\u2019s stories such as these. It reminded her of how her parents used to stroke her head while they read her fairy tales when she was young. Growing up, she became too embarrassed to ask them to do it again.Whenever she felt like going crazy, she knew she could always rely on wrapping up her day with stories of Ed.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dYennekar rolled her feet as she wandered into the entrance of the northern forest. Yes, she was aware of how pathetic she was acting.Was this because of the Glasskan incident? And yet, there seemed to be some signs even before then.It wasn\u2019t anything special.Her affection and longing for Ed were like light rain\u2013when she noticed it had been raining, her whole body had already been completely drenched.In her defense, Merilda\u2019s descriptions of him were way too detailed.The wind spirit described the details of Ed\u2019s muscles with his shirt off. Merilda even went into detail about his biceps and his abs that were starting to form. Yennekar couldn\u2019t help her blood rush to her head.She couldn\u2019t even look at him properly when she accidentally ran into him downtown. Her eyes kept on straying and glancing at the tendons near his collarbones and the veins on the back of his hands\u2026She left as if she was running away, her nose bleeding. Her best friend Anise even worried about her. Clara looked even more worried, a strange cold sweat running down her face.Yennekar didn\u2019t bleed to the extent of that worry. It was quite an overreaction, something she thought was unusual for Clara.\u201cJust what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing\u2026\u201dYennekar came to her senses. Every time she had a bit of time, she always found herself thinking about him. Was there anyone else as stupid as she was?She stomped her feet because of how pathetic she was acting.In the first place, Ed Rothstaylor was someone who had already been disowned by his family. Although he was often called Ed Rothstaylor out of habit, he was just now a commoner with a two-letter name\u2013Ed.This meant there was no longer a significant difference in their statuses. Truth was, Yennekar\u2019s imagination was already going quite wild.For example, she had already imagined the two of them working together back at their ranch in her hometown which was lacking workers. Or they could be doing research together somewhere like the Eastern Magic Society after graduation. Or they could stay in school together and become professors.Thinking such thoughts made her kick her blanket around when she lay in bed\u2026 imagining.She had no idea she was capable of such delusion, and as time passed by, her sense of shame continued to rise.\u201cHow long am I going to keep acting like this? Ed must think I\u2019m weird\u2026\u201dEd\u2019s reputation may have improved, but it still wasn\u2019t all that great.Ed was well aware of that fact, so he didn\u2019t think it was strange that Yennekar was avoiding him but\u2026 it was a completely different story for Yennekar.Objectively speaking, it would be rude to avoid someone so blatantly.Regardless of her feelings, it was basic human courtesy. She could no longer keep acting like this.Yennekar nodded her head as she began heading towards where Ed was.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *[Name: Ed Rothstaylor ]Gender: MaleAge: 17School Year: 2ndSpecies: HumanAchievements: NoneVitality: 8Intelligence: 7Dexterity: 10Willpower: 9Luck: 6Combat Skills Details \u226bMagic Skills Details \u226bLife Skills Details \u226bAlchemy Skills Details \u226bFinally. My Dexterity stat had reached level 10.From here on out, I could even be considered specialized in Handicraft-making.Moreover, my proficiency in production increased the moment it reached level 10. This meant that with the conditions met, I was able to acquire advanced production skills.Spiritual Infusion\u00a0allowed me to inject the power of a spirit into a product I crafted.Magical Engineering\u00a0allowed me to make different types of magic items.Magic Implementation\u00a0allowed me to give various effects to ordinary products.Craftsman\u2019s Spirit\u00a0allowed me to exert greater power in combat using the products I produced.And lastly,\u00a0Pharmacist\u2019s Eyes\u00a0allowed me to skillfully mix together various reagents and herbs to create something new....Advanced skills allowed the use of different special skills in their various forms, skills only obtained if the conditions were met and through combining Combat, Magic, and Alchemy skills together.The only advanced Production skill I could realistically obtain right now was\u00a0Spiritual Infusion. But I knew I would eventually be able to try out the other advanced skills if I worked hard enough.I felt a sense of accomplishment at the increase in growth I experienced as a result of working on my cabin. It gave me strength and encouraged me to work even harder,It was like a great and advantageous cycle. Meanwhile, I started to think of what I could fill my cabin up with, already thinking of different things I could build.The most urgent thing right now was a door. I already bought a hinge and attached it to a wooden board but it wasn\u2019t that durable. Another thing was that the size of the board I used didn\u2019t fit the threshold so a draft had come in.I continued to think of ways I could solve this problem while I cut some wood in front of my cabin.\u201cHe~y! E~d!\u201dSomebody greeted me off-key.I turned my head around to see that it was Yennekar. It looked like she came to the camp for some reason.Unlike her usual neat uniform, Yennekar was wearing a dark blue skirt and a large white blouse instead. She had a hat and shawl on, making her look quite warm. It seemed she may have worn them to avoid getting sunburnt. A smart decision, in my opinion. Yennekar had pale skin that seemed weak to sunlight. The sun wasn\u2019t that strong now as it had already begun to set, but hey, nothing good came out of being careless.On the other hand, I was holding a saw as I cut wood on my workbench, the sleeves of my shirt and the legs of my pants all rolled up. My raw and unfiltered appearance had quite a gap compared to hers.\u201cHey, Yennekar. What brings you all the way here?\u201dI naturally responded.In actuality, I was a little confused. Yennekar had been avoiding me for the last few days. I wondered if she had some business to do around these parts since she appeared to have come all the way here to my camp on her own.\u201cOh, it\u2019s totally nothing!\u201dYennekar started explaining herself.\u201cI was just passing by! Was on my way to see Merilda! Then I saw this cabin! And now I\u2019m here!\u201dShe talked as if she was in a rush.\u201cI saw the cabin so I became curious. Who built it? How did they build it? What does the inside look like? It's only natural to be curious, right? Hm, Ed?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 guess so?\u201d\u201cYeah! I saw your cabin and had a completely natural and obvious thought which led me to do the natural and obvious thing. And here I am! By the way, this cabin is so cool, Ed.\u201dI threw my saw by my workbench and wiped off my hands.\u201cYeah, I recently built it. Did the spirits not tell you?\u201dYennekar let out a hiccup as if stabbed by those words. She shook her head.\u201cDid I already tell you I just happened to be walking by? Ah.. yeah, there may have been something like the spirits telling me\u2026 but just a little? Like, a really tiny amount? Information so little it was practically useless? I don't talk to spirits that much anyway. Yeah, that's right! I only talk to them from time to time. Just like getting updates, you know? That's why I really didn't know how you were doing. I'm serious.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 alright, then. You can go in, if you want. It's pretty sturdy so it shouldn't be that bad at all. I'm quite proud of it, in fact.\u201dI nodded my head and pointed toward my cabin. Yennekar was strangely hesitant as she entered, touching and staring at every little thing.Yeah, it was just a log cabin.But I'm quite proud of the fact that I built it myself.Night came and with it, its usual fanfare.The buzzing of cicadas was pleasant to listen to as always. The moon had started to show itself just as the stars slowly began to map themselves across the sky.I made tea in a mug I bought from downtown using the herbs Bell had given me. Yennekar held the mug with both hands as she sat down, staring blankly at the flickering flame.I hadn't built a proper fireplace in my cabin yet so I dare not make a fire inside. I would be too upset to sleep if I ended up burning down my own cabin which I worked so hard on.This was why I decided that I would continue camping outside until I could properly finish its internal construction. But even still, just looking at my nearly completed house felt like my dreams had finally been realized.\u201cYou\u2019re quite amazing, Ed. Most people would have given up in your situation.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I did anything that deserves praise.\u201d\u201cNo, this is already quite amazing.\u201dThe strange hesitation she had before had already disappeared. The mysterious atmosphere of the forest at night brought about peaceful feelings that helped people calm down. Coupled with a cup of herbal tea, things were just perfect.\u201cI don't think I could've done anything if I were to end up in your place, Ed.\u201d\u201cUh, aren\u2019t you\u2026 going to have to move out of Ophelis Hall soon?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll probably end up going to Dex Hall.\u201dThe three dormitories of Silvenia: Ophelis Hall, Lorail Hall, and Dex HallDex Hall had the worst facilities among them. It was also home to the majority of regular students.Depending on how much you've paid, they had rooms for four, eight, or even ten students. It would be difficult to get used to for someone who came from Ophelis Hall.Well, Yennekar wasn\u2019t from a wealthy family so it shouldn\u2019t be\u00a0as\u00a0difficult.\u201cWhat about your tuition fees? Can your folks back home afford it?\u201dYennekar shook her head.\u201cFebri said she\u2019d lend it to me. I can slowly pay her back once I graduate.\u201dFebri was the second daughter of the Kroel family.That\u2019s fair. After all, Yennekar was someone who could do anything once she had graduated and gotten her diploma. It wasn\u2019t a risky investment. Even they had been trying to clear up their debts, it seemed.Even with that amount of support, Yennekar was stubborn about moving to Dex Hall. Lorail Hall would have been a better dorm for her but she didn\u2019t want to rely on her friends to live in a better dormitory after the huge incident she had created.\u201cI\u2019ve gained quite a bit of debt. I didn\u2019t know that everyone would help me so much during the hearing. Especially Princess Penia and Lortel. Even though I made such a huge mistake, for some reason, everyone was trying to comfort me\u2026 I\u2019m so thankful. I can\u2019t even begin to describe how thankful I am.\u201dYennekar still didn\u2019t understand that the problem stemmed from the weight of her sincerity. In the end, none of the underlying problems were solved.The vicious cycle was yet to be broken.\u201cHow should I\u2026 pay everyone back?\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t pay them back if you can\u2019t.\u201dDespite everyone\u2019s expectations and support, Yennekar ended up failing.The shock of it hadn\u2019t disappeared and yet, new debts just kept on piling up.\u201cIsn\u2019t that just a stereotype? That you\u2019re supposed to pay off what you owe? Do you really need to pay someone back just because they lent you something?\u201d\u201cOh. Wow. I\u2019ve never thought of that.\u201dThere were so many ways to not pay back what they owed. In the same way there were so many people who lived their lives never paying back theirs.However, this concept was completely unimaginable for Yennekar. That was just the kind of person she was.\u201cYou\u2019ve gone through a lot, either way. You\u2019ll have to move dorms soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure the facilities won\u2019t be that great once I move to Dex Hall, but I think it will still be a lot more enjoyable. I can spend the whole day with my friends once there. From early morning, to late at night. We can joke around with each other in the same room, we can hug our pillows at night before falling asleep, we can snack late into the night talking about this and that\u2026 yeah.\u201dOphelis Hall only housed one student per room.You could quietly rest in your own space after coming back from a hard and difficult day. It was a place to find one\u2019s peace of mind.In that one room, there were no classmates or underclassmen who stared at Yennekar with envy. Quietly sitting on her bed alone as she stared at the moon out her window every night was enough to take some of the burdens off her shoulders.Therefore, Dex Hall was a place that evoked a fundamental fear in Yennekar.It was no different from a prison. Yennekar would live every day chained up.Yennekar lifted her gaze from the campfire and raised her head back to look up at the sky.It was a clear night sky over Acken Island. The breeze was quiet. The darkness and bleakness of the early evening had turned cozy and warm.Yennekar looked strangely on edge. I was uncomfortable just letting her be.\u201cWhen you want to be alone, you can come and stay here anytime. I won\u2019t care.\u201dI casually said. If I unnecessarily sound too sincere and considerate towards her, it would only become poison.\u201cHm? Really, Ed? Yay\u2026 I\u2019m so happy. Hehe.\u201dIt was only then that Yennekar, who had been acting distant towards me these past few days, finally put on that stupid smile of hers after such a long time.\u201cHey, Ed. If you\u2019re having a really hard time or there was something that you\u2019re struggling with on your own, it would be really great if you would tell me.\u201dYennekar softly said as she looked up at the blue sky above us.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely help you then.\u201d* * *\u201cOphelis Hall is quite a mess these days.\u201dThe mug of herbal tea was now empty. Yennekar had grabbed her shawl and was straightening her clothes as she prepared to leave.\u201cIt\u2019s because there are rumors that the head maid will quit soon. I heard the head maid, Elris, had been under a lot of stress lately.\u201dYennekar told me while patting off her clothes.\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange? I haven\u2019t seen her that much but she definitely seemed quite bright and hardworking. Well, I\u2019m going to leave Ophelis Hall soon anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter to me too much but\u2026 I\u2019m worried, for some reason.\u201dShe smiled innocently.\u201cAnyways, thanks for showing me around your cabin, Ed. I\u2019ll come and see you often. Can I come every day? Uhm\u2026 No, maybe that would be too much?\u201d\u201cDo what you want.\u201d\u201cHehe! It was such a good choice to come and see you here today, Ed. Then, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow! No, I mean\u2013uhm, next time. See you next time!\u201dAs I said goodbye to Yennekar, I made sure to act as if the information she just told me wasn\u2019t anything special.Come to think of it, the second semester was almost here.The mark that announced the start of Act 2.\u2018The Occupation of Ophelis Hall\u2019It was just an event where struggling students who were unhappy with their unfair treatment took a day to properly express their dissatisfaction. Though didn\u2019t have much influence as no one really cared about them.However, the scale of the incident increased exponentially with the participation of the head maid bought by Lortel. It later developed into a main event in Act 2.This escalated the fight between the Elte Company and the Academic Affairs over the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019. It ended up becoming an event worthy of being called \u2018the beginning of all events.'Ah, pretty soon, you\u2019ll be having quite a hard time, Taylee.I waved my hand at Yennekar as she disappeared into the forest.I offered Taylee a silent prayer with all my heart.Really\u2026 it\u2019s really going to be a pain in the ass, Taylee.Good luck.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (1)My original goal was to create a safe living environment for myself before vacation ended.My crude wooden shelter was now dirty and deteriorating. I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time I had a good\u2019s night sleep.I thought I would be able to finish my cabin before our school break ended so I could start living in it once the second semester rolled in. But now that the second semester was just a week away, I realized I still had a long way to go.\u201cHmm...\u201dI looked at my cabin. It now had a wooden door and a window. I made sure to buy a big hinge this time. It would be a headache if it fell off again. Although I was worried it would quickly get rusty due to its size, and soon make that loud creaky sound. Well, it was still better than just falling off.Anyway, I still had more work left to do before I could live in my cabin.The most important things right now were a fireplace and some furniture.I was actually worried about the fireplace. Sure, it wasn\u2019t that cold this time of the year, even at night, but once the season changes, indoor heating would become a must.On top of that, a fireplace would provide my only source of light at night. It was also necessary to cook my food. Fire was needed for many other survival purposes. It was absolutely essential that I be able to start a fire indoors.But it would be a disaster if I make a fireplace out of wood and it\u2026 catches on fire. It would be a disaster. This was the reason I needed to build my fireplace with a stronger material. The first thing that came to mind was bricks.Elte Company\u2019s General Store downtown sold everything you could think of, but it would still be too much, even for them, to be selling bricks in an educational facility. I ended up going to Nail Hall\u2019s construction site and asked to buy some of their bricks, but they couldn\u2019t sell me any since their bricks were delivered exactly as inventoried.In the end, I decided to start making my own bricks.[ Newly Crafted Product ]Brick CastingConstruction scraps were nailed together to make a square.You can mold mud into bricks by filling it with mud.Production Difficulty Level: \u25d0\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dIt only took me five minutes to make a mold to cast my bricks in. I threw my hammer on my workbench and wiped off my sweat.I gathered mud from the river and squeezed it into the casting, making sure to press it in hard. I then took it under the shade and removed the cast. I planned to mass-produce standardized bricks by repeating this process tens, or even hundreds, of times. I would then dry them for a week and then stack them up in my cabin to create a decent fireplace and chimney.However, I would be using mud to stick my bricks together instead of cement. This worried me since mud wasn\u2019t as strong an adhesive as cement was. I thought I should make and attach a support fixture to keep everything together.It would also be great if I could make some furniture to use indoors but I didn\u2019t have any specific plan for that just yet.I could easily make some simple pieces of furniture since my woodworking proficiency was quite high. I had learned quite a few tricks here and there. The design behind each was actually quite easy to come up with.Items like tables and chairs were relatively simple as long as I had the materials.It should also be quite easy to create a bed frame. Although for the mattress\u2026 it should work if I were to buy something like a large piece of fabric or bag of sorts and fill it up with feathers, cotton, or hay.I would also like to install a glass window, if possible. But I wondered where I would even be able to purchase such a thing.I walked through the forest as I gathered my thoughts, my bow in hand as I searched for my meal for the day.[ Combat Skills Details ]Grade: Beginner CombatantSpecialized Fields: Bow\u0700 Bow Proficiency Level 6\u0700 Vital Points Snipe Level 3\u0700 Quick Shot Level 2\u0700 Retreat Shot Level 1\u0700 Sense of Aim Level 2\u0700 Field of View Expansion Level 1It was at times like this that I realized just how talentless Ed Rothstaylor was in Combat Skills. I always had to force myself to use the bow whenever I went out to hunt. But the vacation was almost over and my bow skills were still this poor.Looked like I would need some special measures to grow this as well. I would find a way, one way or another.\u201cI found one.\u201dI chanced upon a fawn walking through the forest. I hid among the trees and took out my bow.I had been finding all sorts of people at my camp recently.Bell Maya used to stop by and share various ingredients with me but she hadn\u2019t been coming over as much these days.Meanwhile, Ziggs would jog through the forest once every three or four days. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t only been running through the forest, but all over Acken Island instead. Just as I expected, his Vitality stat wasn\u2019t normal. If not for Elka being in the Magic Department, I was sure he would have joined the Combat Department.There was also that one innocent student who happened to pass by but ran away in horror at seeing me carry a bunch of dead squirrels.Then Claire, Princess Penia\u2019s Head Escort, also came to check on me to see how I was doing.Ah, how should I put it? Quite a few people now knew that I lived here in the northern forest. I hoped the news wouldn\u2019t reach the Academic Affairs Office and end up causing me trouble\u2026Well, not like the whole of Acken Island was managed by the school so there shouldn\u2019t be a reason for them to kick me off of it immediately. I didn\u2019t have to be too scared of that possibility.But of the guests who would often visit me, there were three students who were particularly special.Guest A was a one-of-a-kind genius magician whose visits were at complete random.Sometimes, this guest would come over in broad daylight, when the sun was still high up in the sky. She would then lie down next to my campfire and sleep. Other times, she would come over at midnight where I would find her sleeping on the roof of my unfinished cabin.There was also that time I came back after hunting by the river to find her laying down on my hammock. She was looking at my cabin with big sparkling eyes. She must have felt like she now had a new secret base or hideout\u2026She would then keep on asking me things like:\u201cHey, you know what? Are you going to make a chimney?\u201d\u201cOooooh! You installed a door!\u201d\u201cHow about you build a backdoor too!\u201dEven when I was cutting firewood by the riverside, she would just randomly appear from the top of a tree and say:\u201cCan\u2019t you install a glass window instead?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t collapse, will it? I shouldn\u2019t use my magic nearby\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about adding a window on the roof too?\u201dAnd when I went to check up on the hunting snares I had set up, she would randomly pop out of bushes and ask:\u201cCan I try using magic inside?\u201d\u201cHow about laying down some marten skin inside, huh?\u201dAnd then that time I was sharpening the blade of my dagger using a rock, she was right on top of said tock and kept on kicking her feet high up in the air to tell me:\u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t you try having the door open towards the sunlight?\u201d\u201cYou know, they say you need two windows for the wind to circulate better.\u201dAnyone would think this punk was bullying me.I was getting sick of answering her questions and suggestion one by one that I ended up picking her up, and throwing her into the wooden shelter. Every. Damn. Time.This was Guest A.Guest B was a second-year top student who was also quite the talented Elementalist. I was rather welcoming of this visitor.\u201cTa-da! I brought some eggs. Bell said it would be great if I could bring these to you so I came to visit.\u201dShe put down a basket of eggs by the campfire and did her classic \u2018hehe\u2019 laugh.This was a neighbor who I was grateful for since she would bring me food and other daily necessities that were rather difficult to find in the woods.Even though this Elementalist kept on coming over every day, she would just sit down by the tree and read her books while she talked with spirits. It was a rather pleasant sight so I allowed it.One day, she manifested a spirit that brought over a large washbowl and started boiling water out of the blue.\u201cI\u2019ll show you something amazing. Don\u2019t worry about anything and just sit there, Ed!\u201dI didn\u2019t pay any mind to the faint laughter I heard coming from her direction as I kept on pouring mud into my brick casting by the river. I finally came over when it was time to eat and found her with her sleeves rolled up and her skirt tied high while she continuously stepped on something in the washbowl.I went to check what it was and I found my uniform shirt.It was a shirt that I had been washing like crazy, crazy with force enough to nearly tear the fabric apart. Even still, I had to keep wearing it the entire semester. Therefore, it was only inevitable that over time, things like dirt stains that couldn\u2019t be erased would pile up.This particular guest seemed quite uncomfortable with this shirt.\u201cTa-da! I boiled salt water and pressed it down to make it white. Isn\u2019t it amazing? My parents used to do this when my clothes would get dirty back on our ranch.\u201dShe then opened up the completely white shirt with a proud smile on her face. Seeing that smile made it look like she was waiting to get praised. I couldn\u2019t help it. I have her a round of applause.I kept on clapping and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the best! So cool! It\u2019s amazing how you know such things!\u201d She just lowered her head through all the praises, all awkward and shy. She was someone who would always do the opposite of what you would expect from her.There were some things that were quite obvious about her, but there were also things that I couldn\u2019t quite understand. For example, whenever Lucy would randomly show up out of nowhere, Guest B wouldn\u2019t even be surprised and give her greetings, nor ask me things like, \u2018How often does Lucy come here?\u2019She was truly someone whose actions couldn\u2019t be explained.This was Guest B.But the main point of this was Guest C.Guests A and B were people who relatively showed up quite often. There was no particular surprise meeting them so I would just treat them as I usually did.But with Guest C, this thought came to my mind, \u201cWhy the hell is this person here?\u201dThe sun was starting to slowly fade in the west, bathing the forest in red.My first arrow missed so I ended up chasing after it for more than an hour. At the end of the day, I was able to catch a deer and hauled its corpse back into camp.Two unexpected people were waiting for me by the campfire.One of them was dressed in a neat maid uniform. She stood calmly, her two hands together.The other was sitting next to the fire, humming a song as she had her chin resting on the palm of her hand.\u201cOh my, Ed. I\u2019ve been waiting for you. Your work must have taken quite a while.\u201dTo the public, this person was called \u2018The Golden Daughter.\u2019She was Guest C.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianianJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018The Occupation of Ophelis Hall\u2019 was an event that marked the start of Act 2, and would take place in Ophelis Hall on the very last day of vacation.Just summarizing the main points would take quite a while.As the summer vacation came to a close, the lower-ranking students that had just returned to school would take over Ophelis Hall, overcome by resentment towards the students who lived there for having special privileges and treatment.At the heart of it all was Wilane, \u2018The Representative of Lower-Ranking Students,\u2019 whose speech spanned well over 20 chapters.They argued that top students who lived in Ophelis Hall were guaranteed a life of aristocracy. They had permission to select seats first when taking classes, they had first choice when it came to eating, and they even have maids dedicated to them.These frustrations that had accumulated over time suddenly exploded due to an incident that happened during vacation.Heavy rain began to pour down in southern Belor where Acken Island was located just as the students were returning to school. However, the academy announced that they would only provide carriages and ships for students from Ophelis Hall. The other students would need to figure out how to get back to the Academy on their own. But not only that, the academy would only give them a few days to return before they are expected back.The lower-ranked students who had to endure the heavy rain as they traveled back to the academy, all the while in fear of having points deducted for arriving late\u2013these students finally exploded. They met at Dex Hall and established a plan to come together and occupy the luxurious Ophelis Hall and express their dissatisfaction.It wasn\u2019t a realistic plan, of course.Not only was Ophelis Hall home to the top student in each grade, but even the maids who managed the dormitory were not easy opponents. Everyone in the building knew how to wield a rapier, and the senior maids even knew how to use intermediate magic.No matter how many low-ranked students gathered, there was no way for them to successfully take over Ophelis Hall. It was like watching a group of lemmings swarming over a cliff from a distance.And even if they managed to occupy the dormitory, Ophelis Hall was home to all sorts of aristocratic and influential people. This meant they would receive a heavy punishment. This made the scale of the situation a bit limited.But that was until Lortel intervened.\u201cThe low-ranked students are talking about quite an interesting plan among each other.\u201dLortel was smiling widely across the campfire. I kept sharpening the blade of my dagger without giving her much of a response.I looked up to check and the person next to her was definitely Elris, the head maid of Ophelis Hall.As if she was waiting for Lortel\u2019s orders\u2026 there wasn\u2019t anything strange about her quietly standing there without saying a word.She was the only person who had access to the protective magic inside Ophelis Hall. And although it was called protective magic, slightly twisting it in a certain direction would enable you to use it in a totally different way.There was no reason to explain just how important having that level of authority was.Only those who have worked long enough at the academy, all while receiving the school\u2019s full trust, could qualify as the head maid.In other words, Elris was definitely not someone who could have been easily bought over with just a few coins.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI want to ask for your help.\u201d\u201cYou need my help?\u201d\u201cYou suit the role.\u201dLortel deeply sighed and continued to talk.\u201cOriginally, the decoy\u2026 I was going to have Totte do the job but he got himself seriously injured.\u201dI put the dagger that I was sharpening down at her words.This was a story that I couldn\u2019t just ignore.\u201cOh, you\u2019re finally going to seriously listen to me, huh, Ed?\u201d\u201cWhat about Totte?\u201dDecoy Totte. He didn\u2019t have a very important role but it was a name I remembered clearly.He was the intro boss that appeared at the beginning of Act 2. His role was to get into an argument and get beat up by Taylee over vacation. He would later reappear as a one-phase boss in Act 2 Chapter 3: The Occupation of Ophelis Hall.It wasn\u2019t as big of an event as the Glasskan Subjugation was, but this Ophelis Hall event would have enough influence in the later stories.It had five named bosses.The 1st-floor boss, \u2018Decoy Totte.\u2019The 2nd-floor boss, \u2018Gloomy Clevius.\u2019The 3rd-floor bosses, \u2018Shaney, who is in charge of dishes\u2019 and \u2018Kelly, who is in charge of washing the beddings.\u2019The 4th-floor boss, \u2018The Representative of Lower-Ranked Students, Wilane.\u2019The 5th-floor boss, \u2018Head Maid Elris.\u2019First among these bosses was Totte. He was meant to set the atmosphere, get beaten up, and then disappear. If this was the original timeline, then he should have already been bought by Lortel to become part of the Ophelis Hall incident.\u201cAh, how should I say this? That guy wasn\u2019t one to take things seriously. Plus he didn\u2019t seem that trustworthy at all\u2026 but he knew to keep his mouth shut, at least. So I thought I would go ahead and trust him, but then I didn\u2019t expect Ziggs to beat him up\u00a0that\u00a0badly. He\u2019s in the hospital right now.\u201dSomething seemed to have fallen out of place in the timeline. I was sure there weren\u2019t that many influential large events that should have taken place over the vacation.\u201cZiggs beat him up?\u201d\u201cTotte seemed to have gotten into a fight with Taylee and Ziggs. Seriously, why did he go ahead and do something stupid like that?\u201dSo far, everything seemed to follow what I knew.Totte was another third-rate villain who was used at the beginning of Act 2. His only role was to get beaten up by the main character\u2019s group of friends after arguing over nothing.In fact, this character was only meant to make Ziggs look good. Totte came over and mocked the \u2018failed swordmaster\u2019 Taylee, saying his talent was fake. So Ziggs came over and hit him full-on.Taylee and Ziggs would have gotten quite close during vacation, so it was only natural to start Act 2 with such an incident. I knew that was going to happen.However, it seemed like there were some parts I didn\u2019t know.For example, what did Totte specifically say to Taylee?\u201cHe looked at Taylee and said, \u2018You\u2019re not even as good as Ed Rothstaylor\u2026 You\u2019re just a human that\u2019s even lower than an insect.\u2019 Weren\u2019t his words too harsh?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201d\u201cTo tell you the truth, Taylee and you were both insulted at the same time\u2026 but Ziggs was the one who got twice as angry.\u201dAh\u2026 this was why I was trying to minimize my involvement with any of the main characters\u2026 these situations were starting to become a bit too difficult to deal with.\u201cElvira told me that Ziggs would have normally been a little upset, at the very least. But he seemed more angry than usual that day. Well, he did apologize after his anger faded away, but Totte was still a bit too emotional at that time.\u201dLortel paused to catch her breath.\u201cI can\u2019t trust such an emotional person.\u201dThen she looked me straight in the eyes and said,\u201cYour task is not that difficult. All you have to do is get the key from Elris, stay in Ophelis Hall for a while, and then open the door to let the lower-ranked students in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure there are a lot of other people who could do that other than me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s actually not as many as you would think. No matter how the situation turns out, this is a job that needed someone to remain level-headed. And above all else, you have enough reason to participate.\u201dWhy was Lortel telling me all this?\u201cEven if I bribed someone with enough money, there was no guarantee they wouldn\u2019t rat me out to the school\u2019s internal investigators once the incident is over. \u2018Oh, the person behind all this was actually the first-year student Lortel.\u2019 If someone went ahead and confessed that, how do you think that would make me feel? There wouldn\u2019t be anyone I could trust.\u201dI finally understood why Lortel picked me.I had already been kicked out of Ophelis Hall. I continued attending the academy despite getting ridiculed and looked down on by everyone.I didn\u2019t really care, if I were being honest. Ed Rothstaylor deserved that kind of treatment in the first place. Sure, it was a little bit unfair to me, but right now, all I could really do was focus on my own survival.How students view me would fade over time, one way or another. The first-years seemed to have actually started viewing me favorably.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to hit them back, Ed?\u201cLortel smiled softly as she asked me.It seemed like she thought I was holding a grudge against the academy.Well, that was just pure speculation on her part.\u201cEh, not really.\u201d\u201cOh? Really?\u201d\u201cBut sure, I\u2019ll listen to your terms first.\u201dI didn\u2019t panic and came to a conclusion right away.If I rejected Lortel\u2019s offer, she would just go and search for someone else to do it. That would just make me even more anxious. I wouldn\u2019t know would replace Totte then.I\u2019d rather take the role, carefully open the door, then lose to Taylee.That was all his role was anyway.The only difference here was that Totte, the first phase boss, was currently unable to do his job. So as long as I was able to solve that issue, then the timeline would be able to go back to its original path.But that didn\u2019t mean I would just do it for free. Since Lortel was someone who would be able to pay me a lot, I ought to get as much as I could from her.\u201c20 Coins.\u201dThe pay seemed ridiculously high for such a simple task. But considering the fact that I would need to keep quiet after, the calculation seemed correct.Since I wanted the timeline to progress as smoothly as possible, there was no reason for me to reveal Lortel\u2019s involvement in the first place. In fact, this would be pretty much free money to me.As long as I behaved well, then there wouldn\u2019t be a reason for them to investigate me. I\u2019ll just keep quiet and stay out of the spotlight. I\u2019ll send Taylee on his way up and then hide out in Yennekar\u2019s room for a while, maybe even drink a cup of tea, before escaping.\u201cDeal.\u201dI began sharpening my dagger once again.A signal that there was nothing more to talk about here.I had now become the 1st-phase boss.* * *\u201cI feel like something\u2019s wrong.\u201dIt was night in the middle of the forest.The young merchant and the head maid walked side by side back to Ophelis Hall.The silent head maid, who had not spoken once, now spoke with a clear voice once she was alone with Lortel.\u201cHe never asked \u2018Why?\u2019\u201dIt was only natural for a veteran maid to see through people. At the very least, she could tell that Ed Rothstaylor was not a regular person.They didn\u2019t have much to talk about, but it was funny how she had deduced that something was different about Ed with that level of conversation.However, whatever the head maid felt was strange\u2026 and Lortel clearly felt it too.\u201cIt seemed that even you felt it too, Elris.\u201dLortel smiled.\u201cCome to think of it, he had always been like that.\u201dThere was no sense of curiosity from him, something that humans normally should have.With Lortel proposing such a thing, it would\u2019ve been only natural for him to ask \u2018why\u2019 countless times.Why did Lortel intervene in the Ophelis Hall Occupation?Why was Head Maid Elris with Lortel?Why aren\u2019t you disgusted by this initiative from lower-ranked students?There were so many other \u2018why\u2019s he could have asked. They should have kept on coming.This was a backdoor transaction for 20 gold coins. It was only human nature to wonder what their purpose was. Why were they doing such a thing? Lortel had even prepared some believable lies beforehand.And yet, Ed Rothstaylor only asked \u2018why\u2019 once.Why are you asking me, of all people, to do it?\u201cWith that kind of reaction\u2026 it only could be one of two reasons. He was someone not interested in anything else as long as he gets paid\u2026\u201dLortel felt her spine burning for the first time in a while.\u201c... or he was someone who was able to see through all of this.\u201dLortel still clearly remembered the warmth of those three gold coins he had placed back in her hand. At the very least, Ed Rothstaylor was not someone who would sell his life for gold.If so, using the process of elimination, there was only one possibility left.\u201cHow much does he know? I don\u2019t think there should be any clues.\u201dLortel closed her eyes gently before smiling her peculiar fox-like smile. It had been a long time since she had felt this feeling.This \u2018fear of the unknown.\u2019It was getting late into the night. Lortel kept on walking through the darkness of the forest without hesitation.Back there, all he did as she excitedly kept on talking, was to sit there and sharpen his dagger across the campfire.She wondered what he was thinking after she left.She couldn\u2019t figure out what he was feeling, which only made Lortel\u2019s heart run even faster.Someone who was the same as her.To the point where it was\u2026 terrifying.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (2)Among all her senses, Lortel was most confident with her sense of smell.After all, merchants survive in business by relying on it. The same was true for her.Someone with the business acumen to smell trends that others have yet to notice would enable them to act faster.And the opportunity to make quick and easy money usually came from that half-step difference. The way out of a tight situation also depended on that step.\u2018Proposal for Assistance of Ophelis Hall Students Returning to School\u2019Lortel folded the handwritten proposal in half as she sat at her desk in her room. She then put the letter inside an envelope and sealed it with some wax.\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s been raining quite a bit.\u201dRaindrops splashed on her window. The gloomy sky only served to look like it agreed with how regrettable it was that vacation was coming to an end.More than half of the rooms in Ophelis Hall were still empty. The deadline for returning back to the academy was not until this weekend, which was when the dormitory would spring back up to life like usual. But before then, it would continue to be a lonely and quiet place.Lortel felt gloomy walking the dark corridors alone, the rain whipping against the windows as she passed. Though, like a paradox, the gloomy and dreary atmosphere was rather comforting at the same time.This land of learning had too many sources of light for her.There were the students, all of whom were full of hopes and dreams that a beautiful future was waiting for them. They devoted themselves to studying and were always so dazzlingly bright.Was this the light of adolescence?The term had always felt a bit awkward to her. But that was only natural as it was a completely unknown world to Lortel.A bright light would only reveal all the dirt on one\u2019s body.When she looked down at her desk, all she could see were papers full of depressing intentions.She was in contact with the representative of the lower-ranked students, Willain.With his teeth clenched, he was looking for an opportunity to get at the academy but also at the students living in Ophelis Hall. This ongoing heavy rain as everyone returned to school was a sure opportunity for him.If they were to create a random cause that the lower-ranked to average-ranked students could rally behind, the complaints would surely start piling up. The Willam would come in, a master instigator who was also a master orator. He would then use that incident as a trigger to finish up everything else.The head maid in charge of Ophelis Hall was already on Lortel\u2019s side, part of the academy\u2019s Administrative Proposal Review Department as well. They would enthusiastically support Lortel\u2019s proposal for sure. It was a proposal to adjust when the Ophelis Hall students would need to come back to the academy.It was a completely different treatment compared to an ordinary student who had to tough it out and return back to school in this heavy downpour.But it didn\u2019t matter if the school would accept Lortel\u2019s proposal or not. Just the fact alone that they would seriously consider such a plan would be enough to infuriate the other students.\u201cThis peaceful atmosphere will soon be gone.\u201dThis incident needed to be as big and grand as possible, The more property damage there was, the better.No.If possible, it would be for the best if the whole of Ophelis Hall itself was completely destroyed.On top of the ledger was the academy\u2019s flow of money. This was completely Lortel\u2019s territory. The flow of funds and the structure of finances were things she could clearly deduce just by playing around with the academy a few times.Silvenia\u2019s finances were already in a crisis. The repair work of Nail and Glockt Hall due to the Glasskan incident already required funds from the Elte Company.The academy\u2019s chronic cash shortage would be easier than taking candy from a baby at this point. There wouldn\u2019t even be a need to open the school\u2019s financial records.Lortel had been able to clearly assess the situation with her own two eyes just by attending the academy for a semester. Estimating the school\u2019s quarterly cash flow would be easy to calculate with just a piece of paper, a quill, and some ink to write the formulas down.Headmaster Obel\u2019s perpetual external activities outside of school grounds also became clear.He had been trying to solve the cash bottleneck that had only gone worse this semester. The VIPs he had met were all extremely wealthy and influential people. He had been constantly running around on his own two feet with his sleeves rolled up, in search of a financier.The academy\u2019s financial structure itself was not that bad. But having a payment due date would be a disaster, and could destroy even the most sturdy asset structures at once. \u2018Assets\u2019 and \u2018Cash\u2019 were completely different concepts, after all.Bankruptcy caused by poor management was a reality that one needed to calmly accept. However, bankruptcies caused by a temporary cash bottleneck felt too unfair, to the point it could make blood flow from one\u2019s eyes.The academy\u2019s management would do their best to stop that from happening.Lortel pushed her creaky chair back and leaned against the window.Ophelis Hall was the most luxurious and magnificent among all the buildings in the academy.The dormitory was full of valuables and expensive pieces of art. The stained glass that was embroidered on the wall was handcrafted by a famous artisan whose name remained in history. The wallpaper, the carpet, and even the wooden furniture\u2013all were handmade by famous craftsmen.There were things that shouldn\u2019t even be in an academy. Noble families and other influential people had donated many pieces of art to inflate their egos.A bombastic incident right now would become a fatal blow to the school\u2019s finances since they were already in a tight spot.This would give the Elte Company an edge in the planned negotiations to purchase the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal.\u2019The magic book was the heart of Silvenia, but for an academy that was truly on its last legs, putting its heart out on the negotiating table was inevitable.\u201cWhen will the rain stop?\u201dThe rain continued its heavy downpour as Lortel looked out the window.No light could be seen under the gloomy sky. It looked like the sky she used to look up at from her shabby house in the ghettos. It gave her a sense of comfort.Whenever rainwater would drip into her shabby house in the ghettos, all the cockroaches that had been hiding in the corners would come out to find new cracks of darkness to hide into, avoiding the light. Lortel remembered the memory with a sense of kinship with the critters.This land of learning that was full of romanticism\u2026 had too many sources of light for Lortel.She, who had been living in darkness, her entire body that had been covered in dirt was clearer to see.The traces of a scheme lying on her desk were proof.The traces of a person who had always stabbed others in the back, doubted their own innermost thoughts, and lived a life devoid of sincerity. Her life had already become like this when she came to her senses after struggling to survive for so long. But none of that changed the fact that she was dirty all along.And so she became obsessed, wandering around, finding others who were just like her.Even in Silvenia, full of sparkling bright students, just maybe\u2026 maybe there was someone here who could sympathize with the life of a dirty gutter rat?Leaning on such fleeting hopes, Lortel looked up at the dark clouds in the sky and quietly said,\u201cI\u2019m lonely.\u201dNo matter how hard she tried, her nature would never change. Her stance on how to survive in this miserable reality would always be the same.She was the man behind the curtain, as the audience called it.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - kianianian* * *[ Life Skills Details ]Grade: Intermediate CraftsmenSpecialized Fields: Woodworking\u0700 Handicraft Level 13\u0700 Design Level 8\u0700 Foraging Level 11\u0700 Woodworking Level 12\u0700 Hunting Level 8\u0700 Fishing Level 6\u0700 Cooking Level 6\u0700 Repair Level 5\u300a Advanced Production Technique Slot: Empty \u300b\u300a Advanced Production Technique Slot: Empty \u300bShwaaaaaaa\u2026It was a heavy downpour.There had been times before when it rained a little bit, but this was the first long and ongoing heavy rain since I lived out here, surviving in the wild.Thankfully, I was able to set up a simple tent over the bricks I had been drying, but it was inevitable they would still retain some moisture from the air. If I had just a bit more time, maybe even just a week, then I could have used magic to finish drying them off and stored them separately\u2026 what awful timing.I would have no choice but to delay any outdoor work if it kept on raining like this. Well, of course, I would need to go out and hunt in the rain if I ran out of food. But I\u2019m not exactly short on food right now, at least.I sat by the fire under a tent, quietly listening to the sound of the rain falling on top of me as I read up on the upcoming second-semester Elemental Studies textbook.Rainwater kept on leaking inside my cabin so I couldn\u2019t relax inside at all. It seemed the mud I roughly applied by itself did not make it completely waterproof. Just as I thought, I needed to think of how I was going to solve my flooring and inner wall issues.I was completely focused on my studies even on such a rainy day like this. The most important thing I needed to concentrate on was Intermediate Magic Theory.Knowing how to do Intermediate Magic was a criterion for determining one\u2019s position as a professional magician. Knowing three or four different types of intermediate magic before the end of your third year in the academy meant you were a magician who had already achieved a lot. I needed to work even harder.School would resume in three days. The occupation of Ophelis Hall would take place on the last day of vacation.The time was near.The Ophelis Hall Occupation incident was a stepping-stone event.Lortel used this event to put the academy\u2019s finances in a tight spot before the main event of Act 2 began, which was the battle over the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019 between the academy and the Elte Company.It was an event that strengthened Lortel\u2019s position as the man behind the black curtain, someone who was manipulating things behind the scenes.For the players playing at that time, this was when the gap between Lortel and who she really was was at its widest.Either way, I already knew what Lortel was planning, what her goal was, and what would happen. I didn\u2019t have any reason to intervene in Lortel\u2019s scheme.She was someone who needed to create a power able to rival Princess Penia\u2019s student council. She would form \u2018The Top,\u2019 an independent interest group within the academy.From my experience when playing the game, I thought the balance of power between the two camps should be about the same.Princess Penia\u2019s idealism and tolerance have the power to unite the two groups. However, her high ideals were far from being realistic, thus creating contradictions and discrepancies in the academic policy.On the other hand, Lortel\u2019s realism and drive had the power to efficiently lead the groups, but her cruel and by-the-book judgment based on values and numbers made the members of her camp too cruel and cold-hearted.Ultimately, the important thing was which side Taylee would choose. Whichever side he would join would end up winning in the end. This meant I had to keep my eye on them to make sure I stick to the side that was most likely to win.If you just called me a complete opportunist, then you were absolutely right.It\u2019s better than being foolish, not knowing what was going on and then wasting precious once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.I also needed to eat to survive, you know?\u201cAhhh\u2026 I should head back to the dorm now. I thought it would stop raining today for sure.\u201dIt was only a little bit past noon, and yet the sky was gloomy and dark, as if it was already early evening.Yennekar squeezed her drenched skirt and went by the fire.\u201cYou must be having quite a hard time, Ed. Since I have a place I go back to, it feels like I\u2019m just out camping when I visit but\u2026 but you need to stay out here even when it rains like this.\u201d\u201cIt will get better as time goes by.\u201dPerhaps it was because she had always enjoyed being in the northern forest in the first place, but Yennekar would often visit the camp and use the campfire to cook, or sit under a tree and read a book.Since the new semester hadn\u2019t started yet, Yennekar seemed to be using all her time for her own healing. Here, she didn\u2019t have to be conscious of other people\u2019s opinions and she could spend her entire days with the spirits she loved.Of course, this camp was where I desperately struggle to survive.In a way, it was kind of rude of her to keep coming here and treating it like some resthouse. But considering all the tools and food she had been bringing, I thought it was a fair trade.\u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s almost time for me to leave my room at Ophelis Hall.\u201d\u201cAh, I guess it\u2019s almost time for that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I have to start throwing away a lot of my excess junk. Dex Hall is a lot smaller than I thought.\u201dStudents were expected to move into their dormitories a week before and after a new semester started.However, once classes started, students become busy and many ended up staying at Ophelis Hall for a few more days. They used the extra week to bring their luggage in or move it out.I wasn\u2019t sure when Yennekar would move out of her room but the fact that she had already started to pack up now meant she would only be staying at Ophelis Hall for a few more days.\u201cSo Ed, if you need anything, let me know. Don\u2019t you have a lot of things that you need?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. I have extra blankets, cushions, watches, lanterns, and such. Apart from those, I also have some daily necessities and consumables. It would be a waste to throw them all away, not to mention it would be quite a hassle to do so. Although if you need something like furniture\u2026 since that would originally be the dorm\u2019s property, I don\u2019t think I would be able to bring those out.\u201dI could make most pieces of furniture and other daily necessities as long as I had the materials. Plus it would be great for raising my proficiency level but\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to receive whatever I could get.After all, it would be hard to solve everything through production alone.\u201cThat would be great.\u201d\u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll be kicked out when the semester starts so I\u2019ll bring everything then.\u201dYennekar laughed as she warmed her hands by the fire.\u201cBut\u2026 does Lucy do that often?\u201d\u201c\u2026sometimes.\u201dYennekar mentioned Lucy suddenly, as if that had been her main point from the beginning.Lucy was currently standing still on the roof of my cabin.Heavy rain was pouring down. The rain that had fallen on my skin wasn\u2019t particularly cold but I was currently drenched in rainwater, an awful feeling.Lucy, on the other hand, had her silverish white hair tied neatly. It looked like it had been done by an Ophelis Hall maid. However, one side had already gotten wet and fallen loose. Her expensive school uniform was no longer properly doing its job of covering her.But Lucy paid no attention to all of that as she continued to stare up at the sky.She looked lazy, as she usually does. Like she had a few screws loose. Her clothes were all messed up and her big witch hat was crooked. However, she looked strangely different today. That could be because\u2026 she was currently reminded of an archmage she had met on a rainy day just like this.The great power that was beyond common sense that Lucy had was not something she was given for free.A chain called fate had wrapped itself around her.Although she had been living her life trying to escape from it, using her laziness as an excuse.She lived her life not complicating things, ignoring her promised fate. But after a while of living as such, she finally came to her senses only to realize that so many years had already passed.On a rainy day like this, even that girl with a few screws loose would think back on her life.\u201cShe seems to have a lot on her mind. How should I say this\u2026 Lucy has always been\u2026 free-spirited? Something like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just say she\u2019s a person who doesn\u2019t use her brain.\u201d\u201cErgh! That\u2019s a bit\u2026 that\u2019s too much.\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be helped. I was just stating a fact.\u201cShe sometimes acts like that when it rains. Don\u2019t worry about it too much. I tend to just ignore her.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Ed, you seem quite indifferent towards Lucy\u2026!\u201dYennekar exclaimed as if she had found out something amazing.\u201cBy the way, Yennekar.\u201dThere was something I needed to check before she headed back to the dorm.Just like I had mentioned, the occupation of Ophelis Hall was not a big event.The scale of the incident itself was quite large but there weren\u2019t many variables in play.The incident would start when the head maid Elris invoked a large-scale spatial defensive magic circle on the roof of Ophelis Hall. That magic circle made by the Assistant Headmaster Rachel was only accessible to the head maid and the general manager of Ophelis Hall.It was magic that was similar to that of a durable fire shutter.It was a high-ranking magic circle that covered every door, every window, every hallway, and every crack in Ophelis Hall. Of course, it was not something that could easily be broken.Late into the night before the first day of classes was set to resume, the students would all be busy cleaning up their rooms, and getting ready to leave early the next day for the opening ceremony.This spatial defensive magic circle was created to use against terrorism or if a disaster were to strike. Ironically, it ended up caging the Ophelis Hall students into their rooms like a barbed wire.All the maids would be oblivious to the situation since they were on their way to an emergency meeting in the staff room but\u2026 they also ended up getting locked in there.This would make the hallways of Ophelis Hall completely isolated.Those who would have access to these halls would be the students taking over Ophelis Hall or the maids who had teamed up with Elris.Other than them, only a few students would be lucky enough to be outside of their room when it happened, although the only two characters emphasized in the story were Clevius and Elvira.Of course, there were students who boast a ridiculous amount of strength, so they could have broken through the walls, or there were those who could have used all their magic power to escape from the spatial-type magic.However, it was impossible for them to know exactly what the situation was like outside of their rooms. It was difficult to guess whether it was a temporary accident or a major disaster, and whether or not it would be resolved soon. Therefore, it was not an easy decision for the trapped students if they should use all their magic power or all their strength just before school started.The occupation of Ophelis Hall was planned around that, taking advantage of such thoughts. It was that complacency that would lead to the destruction of Ophelis Hall.\u201cHm? What is it, Ed?I had called out to Yennekar just as she was about to head back to her dorm. I thought quietly to myself. Yennekar smiled innocently at my hesitation as she tilted her head.Either way, there wasn\u2019t much I needed to do that night.All I had to do was open the door at the right time, then check to make sure the magic circle was working until the lower-ranked students had occupied the fourth floor of Ophelis Hall.Taylee wouldn\u2019t have a choice but to enter Ophelis Hall because Elvira would have forgotten her precious medicinals in her room.Once Taylee and Elvira were inside, I could buy up a decent amount of their time before losing and then sending them upstairs. They would then enter Phase 2 where they had to capture Clevious who had been running away in fear.There wasn\u2019t really much to it. Even if I tried, an unforeseen variable couldn\u2019t possibly happen.But I couldn\u2019t let my guard down.Didn\u2019t I already learn my lesson during the Glasskan Subjugation? That the timeline could get twisted just because of one measly absurd reason.That\u2019s why I needed some insurance.A plan B.There was no harm in keeping some backup on standby to respond appropriately in case of possible emergencies.Yennekar was valuable manpower that no longer had any influence on the main story. She was perfect for the role.Besides, wasn\u2019t she the kind of person who would listen to her friend\u2019s request? To be honest, weren\u2019t we pretty close at this point?\u201cI have a favor to ask.\u201d\u201cHm? What is it?\u201dYennekar smiled widely as she waited for my response. I thought about it for a moment.How many students would be out late at night the day before school started? Most of the students would be resting in their rooms. Same for Yennekar if she hadn\u2019t left her room by then.If she was resting in her room, then she would be trapped by the magic circle summoned by the head maid.But if I were to keep Yennekar as my backup, then I should make sure she was waiting outside of Ophelis Hall.Though having her wait outside on a day when the heavy rain would be pouring down was a bit\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t have her too far away from the dormitory.\u201cCan you come out to the Rose Garden pavilion in front of Ophelis Hall at around 9 o\u2019clock in the evening the day before the opening ceremony?\u201d\u201c\u2026huh?\u201dI would give her a detailed explanation then. It would be impolite to keep her here any longer when she was already trying to head back.\u201cI have something I want to tell you.\u201dYennekar swallowed her breath in complete shock at my words. She looked around, as if making sure nobody else was there. She then lowered her eyes and held the hem of her skirt tightly.\u201c\u2026s-sure.\u201dShe agreed with a somewhat soft-spoken voice. And then quickly said,\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll get going then! Bye!\u201dAnd then disappeared into the woods.I wondered what was so urgent that she didn\u2019t even properly put on the hood of her robe which she had been using in place of a raincoat.\u201c......\u201dI sat by the fire and slammed my book shut. I stared blankly at my cabin, my chin resting on my hand. Lucy was still blankly staring up at the sky.It continued to rain heavily. The sound of the raindrops falling on the tent calmed me down somehow.The forest after the rain smelled different than usual. The soggy smell of grass was thicker.The rain would stop on the morning of the first day of school. I would then be able to see the dazzling sky which I haven\u2019t seen for quite a while now.After that, the forest would start to smell like fall.I hoped this event would finish up quickly so I could start thinking about honing my advanced production skills.I thought about it some more as I sat down and threw a couple more pieces of firewood into the campfire as I listened to the falling rain.The long vacation was finally coming to an end.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (3)\u201cTomorrow will be the start of the second semester.\u201dWhile training alone in his room, it suddenly occurred to Ziggs Eiffelstein that quite a decent amount of time had passed.As he looked out his window, the pouring rain beyond it failed to raise his spirits. Due to the gloomy weather of the last several days, he hadn\u2019t been able to start his day with his usual jog. The conditions weren\u2019t great for training his magic power outdoors, either.His plan to train as much as he could over the vacation was ruined. He had planned on developing various basic skills to keep up his progress in the class, but he still felt that it was a long way off.Professor Glast\u2019s curriculum for Class A was quite daunting for Ziggs, who didn\u2019t have a knack for learning. While Lucy was out of the question due to her tendency to solve every problem with her overwhelming level of magic power, he wanted to watch and learn from Lortel\u2019s delicate use and management of her magic power\u2014as well as her ability to solve problems and adapt quickly.Although Ziggs was considered ahead of her in terms of practical combat skills, he was far behind Lortel in terms of know-how and the skills required to thrive in a civilized society.\u201cI really need to stop letting my emotions cloud my judgement\u2026\u201dZiggs let out a heavy sigh.His companion, Elka, was genuinely angry that he had beaten up Totte in a moment of rage. It was very rare for Elka to get angry at Ziggs. In the end, it was Ziggs who went to Totte and apologized\u2014even though his anger hadn\u2019t fully faded.\u201cHm?\u201dSuddenly, he caught a glimpse of a familiar face in the garden through the pouring rain. Wearing a robe as they ran through the rain, they entered Ophelis Hall. It was definitely the guy that lived in the cabin in the northern forest.\u201cWasn\u2019t he kicked out? If he is trying to force his way into Ophelis Hall, the maids will just kick him out\u2026\u201dHe was worried that that guy might get hurt unnecessarily, but Ziggs already knew him all too well. That was why he didn\u2019t have to worry about such a thing happening.Ziggs leaned back and looked away from the window.* * *Once you opened the main door of Ophelis Hall, you could see the first floor main hall.Every time a student entered the dormitory, the maid in charge of the entrance would quickly check them before letting them in.Unless you wore the red brooch that was given to those allowed in Ophelis Hall, it was impossible for them to check you in and let you enter. Additionally, the maids memorized the faces of all 53 students staying in the dormitory, so you couldn\u2019t fool them.\u201cYou must be Sir Ed? I received the message from the head maid.\u201dOriginally, I would have had to stand in the rain in front of a tightly closed entrance. However, today Ophelis Hall was open.\u2018Kelly, who is in charge of laundry.\u2019She had a small figure and was neatly dressed in the lower maid\u2019s uniform. She was one of the mid bosses in the Occupation of Ophelis Hall Event.There was no way that the loyal Ophelis Hall maids would willingly participate in the occupation. However, Shaney and Kelly\u2014who were trained and raised by Head Maid Elris\u2014were different. They were persuaded to participate in the plan by Elris.Shaney, who wielded a rapier, was in charge of being the vanguard. Kelly was to take control of the hallway with her decently high proficiency in beginner magic. Although you would meet them on the third floor as enemies, they honestly weren\u2019t all that difficult to deal with as opponents. As long as you could defeat Kelly, who was in charge of the firepower, it would be easier than you\u2019d think to break through.Well, that was all something that Taylee would take care of.\u201cIt would have been a disaster if you were any later. We\u2019re going to switch rotations soon.\u201dAnyway, right now Kelly was still in charge of the entrance. As she was instructed in advance, she let me enter Ophelis Hall.\u201cSoon, I\u2019ll be switching places with another maid to go take care of my work. Celara might be a child, but she is a new maid. Still, you should be able to defeat her without much force. She shouldn't be carrying anything like a weapon on her.\u201d\u201cIs it okay for a little kid to be in charge of the main entrance?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult of a job to identify and let people in. In the event of an emergency, there is also a magic tool that allows you to contact the head maid directly, but today she won\u2019t answer the call.\u201dI nodded my head.I would hide inside the hall and, when the time arrived, I would defeat the maid that was guarding the entrance and open the doors. The lower students would then enter and proceed upstairs.By that time, Head Maid Elris would have activated Ophelis Hall\u2019s Defensive Magic Circle. That would seal off the entrance to each room. All I would have to do then is walk around the first floor and check that the magic was working.From there, once I determined that there wouldn\u2019t be any problems, I would come back to the first floor\u2019s main hall and wait for Taylee.According to the original timeline, the members that would overcome this event were Taylee, Ayla, Elvira, and Clevius.However, Clevius wouldn\u2019t join up with them until the second floor, so all I had to do was deal with the other three.\u201cWhat about the other maids?\u201dI looked down the empty hall as I questioned Kelly.\u201cOther than essential personnel, most of them have gathered in the conference room. The head maid gathered them all there, saying there was an important issue to discuss.\u201dShe was thinking of putting them all in a room and sealing the entrance. As expected, once the head is hired on, the plan becomes quick and easy.\u201cI have prepared the things that you requested.\u201dKelly groaned as she brought out a basin near the entrance. It was filled with a thick liquid.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cShould I just leave it in the corner?\u201dI nodded and looked up at the hall.As it was such a luxurious building, it was glamorous even from the entrance. The main hall\u2019s marble floor was sparkling clean. The height of the ceiling was high, making it feel like you were still outdoors.A magnificent chandelier hung from the ceiling, and smaller chandeliers were hung around it. It gave off the impression of stars decorating the moon.As you looked and walked around the center of the hall, it was enough to make you feel quite lonely. The decorative cabinets lining the wall, and even the stone door leading to the hallways, were antiques.\u201cThe walls and floor are all made out of marble.\u201dIt was definitely a luxurious place. I had already visited this place from Taylee\u2019s point of view as a part of the storyline, but seeing it in person was definitely different.I opened the door of a cabinet that was in the corner and put some of the things I had prepared inside. After grasping the location and structure of various things in the hall, I nodded my head and made a rough estimate of what would happen next.Following the original timeline, the boss battle on the first floor wasn't anything special. It just took a bit of time.The key was to take up just a little bit of Taylee\u2019s time before he moved on to the second floor boss battle. Once that was over, the rest would probably go smoothly.The boss on the second floor was \u2018Gloomy Clevius.\u2019It was an event where you would have to chase after Clevius, who broke down a wall because he was afraid of being alone, despite the fact that nothing major had happened yet. It was a scenario in which Clevius, who kept saying he was going to run away, was subdued and then forced to join the party.So until I heard Clevius break down that wall, I needed to stall for time. It was my job to make sure that the timing lined up perfectly.I had no choice but to admit it. There was something that I had realized during Act 1\u2019s boss fight, and that was that the butterfly effect was truly unpredictable\u2026 The fact of the matter was, having the determination to try and control every single variable in the world was nothing more than arrogance.Therefore, once the boss fight on the first floor was completed, I would go out to the rose garden and watch the situation until the very end with my backup: Yennekar. That way, we could respond immediately if any abnormalities occurred.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to check out Taylee\u2019s specs.\u201dIf his specs weren\u2019t enough to clear this event, it\u2019d be a big problem. In particular, the final boss of Act 2, \u2018Inquirer Glast\u2019, was a terribly painful opponent. His Celestial Magic and curses would make you experience the pain of being stabbed with an awl constantly, which would eventually break your heart.It was hard to deal with unless both your stats and mental strength were well trained.I made sure that I had put all the things I had prepared into the cabinet and snapped the door shut.* * *After that, everything went smoothly.As I hid between the main hall\u2019s cabinets, a little after 8 o\u2019clock the new maid and Kelly changed shifts at the front door.- \u201cWe won\u2019t stand by and be treated like this anymore!\u201d- \u201cThis is a land of learning! At least ensure equality in grades!\u201d- \u201cAnswer our voices!\u201dThe cries of the lower and regular students echoed through the main entrance. They gathered in front of the locked Ophelis Hall, chanting loudly. The person at the front, leading it all, was \u2018the representative of the lower students, Willain.\u2019He had short, light blonde hair and horn-rimmed glasses. The brown-gray robe he was wearing was already soaked by the rain.Ophelis Hall symbolized the nobility of the privileged students that attended Silvenia. The students gathered together in front of that symbol, sitting down and studying.Originally, it was all supposed to just end there. They didn\u2019t have a choice but to sit and express their dissatisfaction and resentment towards the privileged students. That was because Ophelis Hall\u2019s front door was shut tight.\u201cEuaaaah! What is this?! I need to report this to the head maid\u2026!\u201dThe new maid, who was taken aback by the sudden situation, trembled as she began to look for the magic tool she was given. Taking advantage of her confusion, I quickly jumped behind her and covered her eyes with a scarf.\u201cUghaahk! What\u2019s happening?! Who are you?!\u201dI lifted the blindfolded maid up onto my shoulder, holding her wrists together tightly with one hand so that she couldn\u2019t untie the scarf. I then unlocked the front door with my other hand and kicked it open.- \u201c...Huuuuuuuuuuh?!\u201d- \u201cWh-WHAT!\u201dThe group of students, taken aback by the sudden change in situation, started to panic. However\u2026- \u201cOphelis Hall\u2019s door has opened! Let\u2019s go inside!\u201dThe representative Willain shouted as the crowd suddenly rushed into the hallways of Ophelis Hall.- \u201cThe management office is on the fourth floor! Let\u2019s take over the fourth floor and issue our statement!\u201d- \u201cLet\u2019s make our voices heard!\u201d- \u201cEqual Treatment! We don\u2019t want much, just equal treatment!\u201d- \u201cLet\u2019s go! Let's show them our potential!\u201dI watched the crowd of students roaring in as I continued holding onto the maid.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re Ed Rothstaylor?\u201dThe 3rd year student Willain, who was leading the charge, reacted after seeing me. It seemed that even the 3rd years knew of my name.\u201cIt was you who Lortel had ended up hiring\u2026?!\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m in charge of being the lookout on the first floor.\u201d\u201cWhy are you\u2026?\u201dI used the lines that I had prepared beforehand.\u201cThere was something that I deeply sympathized with amidst the words that you\u2019ve been shouting. Of course, I lived a comfortable life in Ophelis Hall before\u2026 but once I was kicked out, I realized just how privileged I was. \u201d\u201cEd Rothstaylor\u2026!\u201d\u201cI have just come to realize it! Everything that you said was right\u2026! Until I was kicked out, I was a part of the privileged class. Because of that, I couldn\u2019t relate to the words you were saying. Now I must prove myself through my actions!\u201dAt those words, Willain\u2019s hands trembled in admiration. Ed Rothstaylor was a man who had lived a life of privilege before being kicked out of that cozy cradle. The more human you became, the more you started to realize just how many privileges you enjoyed.\u201cThat\u2019s great! You really have contributed so much to our demands for equal rights! I didn\u2019t realize that you were such a righteous person! I heard the rumors and ended up judging you so unfairly\u2026!\u201d\u201cOf course not. I used to be such a terrible person. The only thing that happened was that I was so impressed with what you said, and I just did all that I could! It was all thanks to you, Willian.\u201dI responded with that before I urged Willian to hurry on.\u201cPlease, go upstairs immediately. You need to hurry up to the fourth floor management office to issue a statement!\u201d\u201cR-Right! Thanks for your help!\u201dWillian was in a position to accept all the responsibility once this incident finished.He would be subject to a heavy punishment for the act of instigating students and urging them to violate school regulations.If all of the students here were severely punished individually, the school would never return to normal. That\u2019s why they would decide to use his punishment to make an example out of him.The students who had simply participated in Willain\u2019s plans would ultimately only be blamed for being tempted by his incitement, thus engaging in destructive behavior. Compared to Willain, they would only receive a mild punishment. It wasn\u2019t beneficial for me to be disciplined over nothing, but considering the importance of 20 gold coins and being able to keep the timeline flowing smoothly, it was an acceptable risk.That is why the key was to keep on stating, \u2018I\u2019m only taking action because I was moved by what Willain said!\u2019 and \u2018I am only following Willian\u2019s goals!\u2019I needed to make sure all the responsibility that I had would fade away from me as much as possible.Though, Willian had no intention of destroying Ophelis Hall.He had just intended to peacefully end the situation by simply occupying the dorm and then officially issuing a statement\u2026 But everything doesn't go the way you plan.\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 no matter what I do, I'm in a position of facing heavy punishment\u2026 it should be fine to just ride on his back, right\u2026?\u2019\u201cHead up quickly, Willain.\u201d\u201cAlright. I won\u2019t forget you, Ed! You\u2019re the best underclassmen\u2026!\u201d\u2018I am sorry!!!\u2019\u2018Stay strong, Willain\u2026!\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *The gentle light coming off the magic circle filled the dark hallway. At the entrance to each room, the defensive magic was doing its job perfectly.- \u201cWhat the hell is going on out there?! Is it really fine to just stay in my room like this?\u201d- \u201cIs anybody out there? The door won\u2019t open. Can\u2026 Can I break it down? It looks expensive though\u2026\u201d- \u201cI saw a bunch of students rushing in through the window, just what the hell is going on?\u201d- \u201cI-If I just wait, then it will all be restored right? It\u2019s not a big deal, is it?\u201dAs I crossed the hall, I heard the voices of the confused students in their rooms.The first floor was mostly full of 3rd years. I checked each room carefully to ensure that there weren\u2019t any missing magic circles. If the story went the same as in the original timeline, then there wouldn\u2019t be any magic circles missing. But even so, I still wanted to make sure of it with my own two eyes.After about 15 minutes of inspection, I came back to the first floor hall and found something that I didn\u2019t want to see.Outside the wide-open main gate, it was pouring rain. I didn\u2019t see the new maid anywhere. Surely she must have just gone to report the situation to her superiors. Unfortunately for her, they all should have been locked up in the fourth floor conference room.The marble floor, which had always been kept sparkling clean, was completely dirty from the muddy shoes that rushed in. Some of the cabinets and shelves were completely knocked down.\u201cOh my. It started much more impressively than I had thought.\u201dThe girl pushed her way through the heavy rain and entered, shaking off her clothes.\u201cAs expected of you, Ed. I\u2019m glad that I trusted you.\u201dShe smiled while taking off her wet robes. Pulling down her hood, she revealed pure white skin.\u201cEghk! My socks got all wet, too. This is why I hate rainy days.\u201d\u201cSo you were watching from outside, Lortel.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t determine if the situation was going well or not if I was trapped in my room. Also, I had to make sure that the students were all gathered up outside. But I didn\u2019t expect it to rain this much. Eghk. Even the inside is all wet.\u201dLortel smiled like a fox as she took off her robe and shook it. Her casual clothes, a white one piece and skirt, that she was wearing underneath it were all soaked through. They looked terrible.She grabbed her reddish-brown hair, which was unusually loose, with one had to dry it out. As she did, she used her other hand to roll up her robe once she had shaken off all the water.\u201cIf the school staff gets involved, we\u2019ll quickly be defeated. We have to get things moving before then.\u201d\u201cAlright. Work hard.\u201dLortel grinned as she finished tidying up. Then she made her way down the hall. She\u2019d probably head up to the fifth floor to discuss the plan with Elris.The situation would get more intense once they handed over the magic circle, which was covering Ophelis Hall with defensive magic, to \u2018the representative of the lower students, Willain.\u2019Then \u2018the representative of the lower students, Willain\u2019 would become the fourth floor boss, with all of the different kinds of defensive magic that protected Ophelis Hall. According to the storyline, you were forced to defeat Willain, who was unable to come to his senses because he was caught up in the endless magic circles running wild, as quickly as possible.\u201cEd, can I ask you something that\u2019s a little out of the blue?\u201dAs if she had a thought in mind, Lortel paused on her way down the hall as she spoke to me. The question she asked was unexpected.\u201cHave you ever killed someone before?\u201dLortel\u2019s voice was still as lively as ever, but the atmosphere suddenly felt as dreary as the weather.I frowned as Lortel let out a laugh, before she smiled and turned her back to me. Her drenched reddish-brown hair was gathered together, cascading down to her shoulders.\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cNeither have I. Haha.\u201dThen Lortel continued to speak, as if she were confessing.\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019ve done a lot of similar things.\u201dLortel\u2019s past was by no means clean.All of the tricks and acts of fraud she had committed while a part of the Elte Store were actions that would have ultimately led to the destruction of someone else.It may not have been a crime when compared to murder, but it was in line with ending another person\u2019s life.Lortel knew that fact better than anyone else.\u201cAt first, I had to survive.\u201dTo survive in a reality that was like a thorny path, it seemed all too natural to stab someone else in the back. The first few times you did it, you might have felt a sense of guilt. That, however, would soon disappear.After accepting the honorable title of a \u2018wealthy merchant\u2019, there were suddenly a lot of people that she had to step on.The world was full of people that, whenever they had a chance, would put a dagger in their own heart. After making it that far, she had begun to wonder if she had been living the wrong life.She had trampled on other people\u2019s lives in order to survive, and to prevent herself from being stabbed in the back, she had betrayed others first.She had lived a life committing such acts with such excuses, but when she thought about it deeply she realized that it was merely self-justification.\u201cEd, what do you think of such a person?\u201dEven though she had realized it later, that didn\u2019t mean that all the stains on her body would be gone.After that, whenever she did a good deed, it would only be considered hypocrisy. She also could never make the bold decision to give up all the wealth that she has built up over her life.Now that she had come this far, she could never turn back.She knew too many of the ugly secrets hidden by several tradesmen, aristocrats, and other influential people to escape from a life of commerce. The moment Lortel\u2019s name lost its value, it would be over.In the end, she had no choice but to run towards the final train station like a runaway locomotive on its tracks. She had come too far now to be hypocritical.As a merchant, a villain, and as a black curtain; the moment she took her first step in that swamp, it began to eat her up little by little. By the time she had come to her senses, her whole body was already settling in the darkness.Who was she going to ask to save her? It was a disaster that she had brought upon herself. She knew better than anyone that she didn't deserve sympathy.That's why she was searching for someone just like her.\u201cIf it were you, Ed, would you sympathize with such a person?\u201dBecause I was already in the sewer up to the top of my head, I understood the truth. I could also never be fully accepted or sympathized with.Regardless of the good or the bad, the feeling of loneliness would come, just like it came for her.The only way to escape that loneliness was to find someone like herself, someone that was also stuck rolling in the mud. She could only be saved once she found someone else that would become used to living at the bottom of the swamp with her.\u201cNo.\u201dOf course, that person isn\u2019t me.\u201cYou should be responsible for your own choices, Lortel.\u201dHearing those words, Lortel\u2019s face blanked for a moment before she finally smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dLortel Kehelland was a girl who had lived her whole life only pursuing reason and rationality.I was already tired, knowing that fact all too well. Until the day that the storyline for \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 came to an end, she would not once show a loss of rationality or become obsessed with anything.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought up such nonsense. Sorry about that. Heh.\u201dLortel\u2019s expression quickly returned to her mischievous smile as she quickly rid herself of her emotional expression.\u201cI should quickly get to my job, then. There\u2019s not much time.\u201dWith those words, Lortel climbed up the stairs and disappeared.I nodded my head as I picked up a chair that had fallen over and took a seat.From that moment on, I would sit still and wait for Taylee to come in.Anyway, I was already familiar with the stats and skills that Taylee, Ayla and Elvira would have during Act 2.Even with the absolute difference between our numbers and stats, that alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to defeat me easily. Though, it wasn\u2019t like I had to defeat them completely. I just had to waste some of their time. It wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal.As long as I bought some time before losing, Taylee would go on up to the second floor.Still, as we fought there was the risk of a few hits landing or injuries being sustained.Well\u2026 It would be a necessary sacrifice\u2026* * *\u201cWhy is there a carriage this late at night\u2026?\u201dSitting in the corner of the rose garden\u2019s pavilion, a short distance away from Ophelis Hall, Yennekar looked down the main road.A magnificently large carriage passed in front of the rose garden. She had never seen such a luxurious carriage before. The golden crown that was drawn on top of it was quite impressive. It seemed like there might be some type of great person visiting.- \u201cSomething that I need to take care of suddenly came up, so I might be a little late. I\u2019ll be there as fast as I can, so please just wait a little longer. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe folded the note that Ed had left behind and held it close to her chest, staring at the pouring rain amidst the beautiful roses.This was actually a good thing. She had time to calm herself down.\u201cD-Did he prepare anything else\u2026?\u201dThe rose garden\u2019s pavilion was somewhere that she had seen every day. This was because it was a place that was right in front of the main entrance of Ophelis Hall, along the path you\u2019d take as you walked towards the teacher district.It was late at night, so she couldn\u2019t see the entirety of Ophelis Hall. However, she could still see part of it through the rain.It felt like some type of accident had occurred.Many students seemed to be heading toward Ophelis Hall, and just now a huge carriage had disappeared in the direction of the dorm.Yennekar was curious, but she didn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t want to move unnecessarily and accidentally miss Ed.For the last three days, she had been unable to sleep as she kept thinking, \u2018What is it that Ed wants to tell me?\u2019Perhaps\u2026 Was it that? No way\u2026 Maybe she was just overreacting? Or was there another reason for him to have called her there? Talking to herself and saying such things made her close friends worry about her.Though she felt guilty about it, she kept on listening to Merilda about every move Ed made.More people than she had realized knew about Ed\u2019s camp. Merilda said that she had seen not only Lucy, but also Princess Penia, Bell Maya, and even\u00a0Lortel\u00a0of all people visit Ed\u2019s camp.Merilda didn\u2019t keep close surveillance on him 24 hours a day, so there could have even been more people that came out to visit him that she didn\u2019t yet know of.The fact that most of the people who visited were female students was heartbreaking for Yennekar, but\u2026 She wasn\u2019t in a position to fuss about it.What would it be like to be in a position to meddle about it, anyway? Such thoughts made the blood rush to her head again.\u201cI-I shouldn\u2019t have worn this. D-does it not suit me?\u201dAfter not wearing it for some time, she had come out wearing an orange persimmon hairpin that had been sent from back home. She had brushed her hair out once more as well, and made sure that her clothes fit nicely, with no wrinkles.As she came all the way out here, she had started to think that the cosmos pin she wore at the festival was prettier. She didn\u2019t think that it went well with what she was wearing, as it was dark outside and it was hard to see. Maybe a brighter color would have been better?\u201cS-Should I just go and change my clothes now\u2026?\u201dYennekar continued to sit still in fear of missing Ed, even as a crowd of students and a large wagon passed by. It would be ridiculous to go all the way to her room now, just because of a hairpin.\u201cM-Maybe If I quickly run there and back, it will be okay.\u201dOnce you make up your mind, it\u2019s better to take action quickly rather than waste time.Yennekar swallowed her saliva as she ran out back into the rain with her robe\u2019s hood on.She was worried that her hair, which she had tried so hard to keep nice, would get ruined by the hem of the hood. Even so, Yennekar ran quickly.If her hair did end up a bit messy, she would just have to hurry up and fix it in her room.* * *\u201cIs it really the right decision to enter Ophelis Hall?\u201d\u201cDo you know how much all the herbs I have in my room cost, Taylee?!\u201d\u201cStill, isn\u2019t it better to wait for the school to take care of the situation themselves\u2026\u201dThe rain was falling heavily. In front of the main entrance to Ophelis Hall, Taylee, Ayla, and Elvira were arguing.\u201cIf I don\u2019t collect the herbs on time and use preservation magic on them, they'll change properties! The difference in the smallest details can change the results of the entire experiment! Do you know how important that is,Taylee?!\u201dElvira puffed her cheeks as she grilled Taylee.Elvira was actually secretly testing reagents in a secret laboratory built on a cliff along the coast without the school\u2019s permission. Because of that, she didn\u2019t really want to get entangled with the Ophelis Hall incident in the first place. Even so, the herbs that she had left in her room were bothering her so much that she ended up grabbing anyone she could see, making a fuss to get them to help her get into Ophelis Hall.Those sacrifices were Taylee and Ayla.\u201cThey\u2019re all just a bunch of lower students, so the three of us can beat them up! All we have to do is take care of the leader, Willain!\u201dAs she said as much, Elvira began to take long strides towards the entrance of Ophelis Hall.\u201cAyla, stop her\u2026! She\u2019s trying to enter Ophelis Hall by herself!\u201d\u201cC-Can\u2019t we just pretend that we don\u2019t know? Elvira is a top student in the alchemy department, she should be good enough to take care of herself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Elvira who is in danger, it's the lower students! Elvira is just going to spray whatever reagents she has in their eyes!\u201dHearing those words, Ayla gulped. Elvira, who was currently behaving completely out of character, really could end up throwing all sorts of regents at the lower students.Taylee was right. It wasn\u2019t Elvira who was in danger, it was the lower students.Taylee and Ayla followed Elvira, who was hastily walking towards the front entrance of Ophelis Hall.\u201cElvira! Stop! Stop!!\u201d\u201cStop nagging and follow me already! I need you to come help me break through, all the way to my room on the fourth floor!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 will it be fine if we just take you to your room? You\u2019re not going to do anything else?\u201d\u201cExactly. I only need to keep the herbs safe, after all.\u201dTaylee let out a sigh once he heard those words, tying up his hair.\u201cAlright. Then, let\u2019s go to your room Elvira.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone blocking my path, I\u2019m going to break my way through them. Got it, Taylee?\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t go around hurting people, Elvira.\u201dTaylee said those words as he looked at Ayla. Taylee\u2019s companion, Ayla, sighed deeply as she followed the two of them.After a short while, they reached the front of Ophelis Hall. Elvira quickly kicked open the front entrance. The door opened with a bang as the first floor's spacious main hall came into view.In the center of the hall, all by himself, a man was sitting in a wooden chair.The man lifted his head, observing the party that entered Ophelis Hall\u2019s first floor hall as the sound of the rain filled the room.Act 2, Chapter 3: The Occupation of Ophelis Hall. The first floor boss that was different from the original timeline.The fallen aristocrat that was excommunicated, Ed.Just like the day he had defeated Takan, he sat with his arms folded and hands clasped together as he waited for the party.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (4)The rain was still falling heavily outside.The sound of rain falling echoed throughout the wide main hall of Ophelis Hall.After Taylee and his party came in and closed the main entrance, the sound was replaced with the tapping of the rain hitting the outer wall.Lightning struck, briefly lighting up the hall. Ed was sitting in the center of the hall, greeting Taylee and his party with a blank expression.\u201cEd\u2026 Rothstaylor\u2026\u201dThough he had been excommunicated from the family and no longer had the right to call himself a Rothstaylor, for Taylee that name would always be the same.\u201cYou\u2026 Why are you here, in Ophelis Hall?\u201dTaylee\u2019s voice was cold. It has been nearly half a year since the incident and his emotions had subsided quite a bit, but for Taylee, Ed Rothstaylor was a person he could never become close with. \u2026\u2026Both Ayla and Elvira were well aware of this fact.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dElvira quickly understood the situation that was developing in front of her.The marble floors of Ophelis Hall, which were always kept sparkling clean, were now covered with muddy footprints. Cabinets had fallen over, no longer in place.These were the leftover traces of the group of students that had gone charging through, and the man sitting quietly in the center had to be guarding the path.\u201cHahaha. What should I say? This is by no means a normal situation. This is too fun. It\u2019s beyond my expectations.\u201dElvira let out a loud laugh. She didn\u2019t know everything that was happening, but what she did know was that things were going to get interesting.\u201cI\u2019m sorry but,\u201dEd, who was still sitting in the middle of the hall, spoke.\u201cI can\u2019t let you go any further than this.\u201dIf they were to ask why? Naturally, there was no reason for him to answer. There was no sign or implication that he would do so. Even though he didn\u2019t express it with words, it was written in his appearance as he sat there with his mouth closed and his face expressionless.Following that, Elvira's response was obvious.\u201cHaha, this is too fun. Do you really think you can stop\u00a0me\u00a0if I say that I'm going to pass?\u201dElvira Aniston was a 1st year student in Silvenia Academy\u2019s alchemy department.Students in the alchemy department didn\u2019t train directly for combat. Most of the students focused on interpreting the structure of magic, exploring the properties and sources of matter, and analyzing and studying the efficiency of various herbs and magic reagents.However, if you were to ask if it\u2019s okay to ignore students in the alchemy department when it came down to a combat situation? The person being asked would have no choice but to shake their head in denial.The students of the alchemy department owned all sorts of magic reagents, wore different types of magic tools, and could easily control the entire battlefield\u2026 They were joker cards that created variables in combat related situations and had the power to completely reverse the difference in power.Seeing the students of the alchemy department overflowing with their uncontrollable antics even made the professors in charge of them admire them. Even though the magic department was rumored to be full of freaks, the alchemy department was even worse than them.Elvira Aniston was considered to be the biggest freak in the entirety of the alchemy department.Though she didn\u2019t specialize in direct melee combat or magic, she was at least at a level where she wouldn\u2019t be pushed around by a 2nd year who could only use beginner magic.Elvira chuckled loudly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to get hurt, you\u2019d better move aside.\u201dAlready, Taylee was giving Ed a look dripping with hostility. The fact that Ed, who had very little to do with this situation, was sitting in such a place and blocking their way seemed to have made him fully aware that something was wrong.It didn\u2019t seem that this story would end with a peaceful demonstration and statements from the lower students. That gut feeling began to bother the entire party.Even then, the situation itself was still not too burdensome.Even though Ziggs had once said that Ed\u2019s beginner magic proficiency was quite excellent, right now his lack of absolute firepower and the sheer difference in numbers between them was something that couldn't be overcome.It was 3 vs 1.A swordsman that was starting to hone his skills, a magician who could use magic at an average level of a 1st year, and an alchemist who boasted the greatest skills amongst her grade level.Ed continued waiting in the middle of the hall, looking quite intimidating. But that didn\u2019t mean he would be able to overcome the overwhelming gap in power.Taylee drew his sword.\u201cWhat is your purpose here, Ed Rothstaylor? Tell me what is going on upstairs, right now!\u201dEd didn\u2019t open his mouth as he sat still, continuing to stare at the party.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 I\u2019ll just have to force you to open your mouth!\u201dWith those words, the battle began.Taylee kicked off the ground as Ayla got into position and started gathering mana. The moment that Elvira tried to reach into her alchemy bag, which was filled with all sorts of reagents, Ed kicked his chair and stood up.- Crash!The chair was rolling around on the floor as Ed began to gather magic power in his hands. Elvira could immediately grasp the flow and basis of that magic power. It was the beginner level wind magic, \u2018Wind Blade\u2019. But who was the target?Taylee, Ayla, or Elvira?Out of the three, the one that Ed, as a magician, had to be the most conscious of was Taylee.The most important thing for a magician to keep in mind during battle was maintaining distance. Victory could only be achieved when they could continuously gather magic power and cast magic.In a battle between magicians, maintaining distance was less important. But when there was a fighter that was skilled in close combat involved, it became the key to victory.As soon as the swordmaster closed the distance, a magician\u2019s chance of winning was completely gone. That meant that the first target that Ed would try to take down was Taylee McLaure, who was approaching him.Meanwhile, if Elvira and Ayla\u2019s supporting fire hit Ed\u2026 It would be an extremely easy victory for the subjugation team.- Whoosh!However, his \u2018Wind Blade\u2019 wasn\u2019t directed towards the party\u2026 it was instead aimed at the sky.The blind spot in their train of thought, the ceiling.In the luxurious and large main hall, a single stroke cut the connection that was supporting the chandelier. With a screech of metal, the huge chandelier crashed right into the center of the main hall.- BOOM!!- CRASH!Of course, there was easily enough time for Taylee to react.The forward momentum of his body was offset by him having to quickly kick off the ground in the opposite direction. After a short while, the main chandelier stood in the spot where Taylee had been moving. Dust rose, obscuring the view of the hall.\u201cKyaaah!\u201d\u201cAyla! Are you okay?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, Taylee! I just fell down because of the shock, that\u2019s all!\u201dAfter the loud crash that filled the hall faded, the sound of people talking started to fill Ophelis Hall. The students that were trapped in their rooms were starting to get anxious. They seemed to be starting to seriously consider breaking down the walls and doors of the expensive building to escape.The first one to succumb to that fear was Clevius, but it didn\u2019t seem that he had come out of his room quite yet.\u201cElvira! Are you\u2014?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about\u2026!\u201d- Whoosh!Elvira's bound citrus-colored hair flew. A few strands were cut by the \u2018Wind Blade\u2019 as it flew through the air.The blade\u2019s target hadn\u2019t been Elvira\u2019s hair, but rather the bag she was wearing\u2014the one that was full of alchemy supplies. The leather was torn and the magic reagents that were inside were pouring out.-CLATTER!Ed choosing to send the large chandelier crashing into the floor without any hesitation had been completely unexpected.They thought that, after trading blows for a few rounds, they would eventually be able to defeat him.The antique interior of Ophelis Hall had given off an atmosphere that it should never be damaged. The unconventional act of destroying that expensive-looking chandelier without any hesitation\u2026 How was he going to take responsibility for that?It seemed to Elvira that Ed\u2019s behavior was reckless, but Ed Rothstaylor was never the type of person to do something so drastic.If things went according to plan, the entirety of Ophelis Hall would end up completely destroyed. Nobody would care about the fact that the main hall was ruined, nor would they end up being held accountable.Since he knew that fact quite well, to him even that magnificent chandelier was seen only as a tool to create a variable in the fight. Of course, from Elvira\u2019s point of view there was something wrong with Ed\u2019s attempt to prevent the party from entering any further.\u2018Looking at that... That means that he\u2019s serious, right? There must be something going on upstairs.\u2019Elvira looked back at the reagents that were scattered all over the floor.All kinds of low-grade reagents had fallen, but none of them were broken. After all, these were reagent containers that were reinforced using a spell cast by Elvira. Until Elvira canceled the spell, the bottles wouldn\u2019t lose their strength.The moment Elvira tried to move her body towards them\u2026- FWOOOSH!A pillar of fire extended from Ed, separating Elvira from the reagents.That wall of fire that stretched out in a straight line was created by the beginner magic \u2018Ignite\u2019, but the scale and heat itself wasn\u2019t normal. It was the results and a clear sign of his extremely repeated practice and his mastery of \u2018Ignite\u2019.Ed\u2019s fire wall divided the main hall into pieces, as if he was cutting cake.A 2-, 3-, 4-layered wall of fire. The flames surrounding the chandelier separated the main hall into separate spaces.\u2018This... isn\u2019t good.\u2019Building a battlefield naturally, like the flow of water, Ed Rothstaylor's judgment was quick and accurate.Elvira was the core of the subjugation team. However, the most fatal drawback for an alchemy student was that they had almost no direct combat power unless they could rely on their magic tools or reagents.Even if it was just a bag full of her alchemy supplies, Elvira\u2019s power was halved just because the contents had fallen out. With the wall of fire set up, she wouldn\u2019t be able to reach them.Usually, alchemy students wore emergency magic tools in the form of a ring or necklace. Elvira, who was overconfident in her skills, didn\u2019t do so because it was too much of a pain.She wondered if it was really possible that he had predicted this moment to that extent, but she shook her head as if admitting that there was no way he would be able to do such a thing.Anyway, using such a large scale \u2018Ignite\u2019 would be difficult in the long-term for Ed, whose amount of magic power was average. It looked like he was aiming for something.'Kghk\u2026\u2019There was a very brief moment where she had lost concentration at the shocking sight of the chandelier falling down. It ended up being a big mistake that allowed him to throw out an attack without any hesitation, with full determination to hit her bag.\u2018Fortunately, there\u2019s still some things left\u2026!\u2019Elvira took out a small glass object from her shirt. It was a magic tool in the shape of a rabbit. That magic tool had been left out in advance because there was something else that she was researching. She had gotten lucky.By smashing it on the floor and breaking it, Elvira\u2019s artificially created familiar spirit manifested.- \u2018Krrrrrr\u2026\u2019It was a rabbit.But its ferocious molars and sparkling eyes didn\u2019t belong to a herbivore. Its size was no different than that of a dhole or a jackal.Elvira quickly gathered her magic power and carved a fire resistance spell into the rabbit\u2019s skin so that the familiar spirit could go through the fire.Since it was crudely created, she was sure that it was going to have a bad effect on the familiar spirit\u2019s body, but\u2026 It didn\u2019t matter if she just used it this one time and then threw it away after... Blood sprayed out of the rabbit\u2019s skin as it screamed in pain, but Elvira forced the fire resistance spell into it.- Fwooosh!Another strike of \u2018Wind Blade\u2019.Perhaps he had determined that Elvira no longer had any combat power, as this time it headed towards Ayla.\u201cKyaaah!\u201d-Clang!Taylee\u2019s \u2018Elemental Slash\u2019 blocked the \u2018Wind Blade\u2019.\u201cGet it together, Ayla!\u201dThe hall was filled with a wall of flame as well as the huge body of the chandelier and the dust that rose from it falling.He couldn\u2019t follow Ed\u2019s movements as he kept moving in and out of the small spaces created by the wall of fire.'Kghk...!The wall of fire was able to be controlled to some extent by the one that had cast \u2018Ignite\u2019. There was no reason for it to create any smoke or grow any bigger in size\u2026 but the heat was real.Taylee was someone who was born to the way of the sword. He could cut down fire or wind if he so desired, but his growth was still lacking so he couldn't control it over a wide range.He might have been able to break through the wall of fire, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to defeat his opponent, who constantly kept moving locations.On top of that, in a furious rage\u2026 Ed was blatantly aiming towards Ayla.Ayla Triss might be well versed in magic knowledge, but in terms of combat power she wasn\u2019t very strong. She was at the level of a 1st year student who was just starting to learn beginner magic. It was impossible for her to use the defensive magic that would enable her to block Ed\u2019s high proficiency beginner magic.As a result, unless Taylee was next to her constantly protecting her, she could be easily defeated at any moment.If Taylee were to boldly close the gap to try and defeat Ed, then Ayla would be completely defenseless.\u201cTaylee! It\u2019ll be better if I leave the hall\u2026! At least until you win\u2026!\u201dAyla was clear on the fact that she was nothing more than a burden. Even though she knew she was a nuisance, she was able to come up with an immediate solution rather than being worried by it.Now that the situation has become like this, It was better for Ayla to escape to a safer place.- \u2018Kyaaaaaaaaaak!\u2019The giant rabbit, imbedded with fire resistance, rushed towards the chandelier. There was almost no burden in terms of magic power, and since it was a familiar spirit that was simply made it was difficult to expect any great results. But at the very least, for a moment it will be able to stop Ed\u2019s movements and expose his position.\u201cTaylee! If you could narrow the distance between the two of you, would you be able to defeat him?!\u201dAmidst the flame, Elvira shouted. At that moment, she had lost most of her magic tools and reagents. Even so, she was still able to create a chance to defeat Ed.\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you can or can\u2019t! You have to do it!\u201d\u201cAlright! Sounds like a plan!\u201dElvira grinned. She put on her wet robe and jumped through the wall of flames.\u201cElvira!\u201dTaylee let out a cry of shock as Elvira ran across the thick walls of flames and rolled on the ground on the other side. She quickly shook off her burning robe and threw it. On one side of her head there was a flame that she quickly put out, leaving a burnt patch of hair behind. Her right forearm also looked a little burned, but she decided to not worry about it right then.Magic reagents were scattered all across the floor. She was only away from them for a short while, but she missed them all so much.Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s tactical advantage came from the fact he took control of the space and obscured their view.If she were to use the reagents or magic tools, it would require her to take aim and throw them. That would take up too much time. Because of that, the only choice they had left was to take advantage of the difference in fighting power.\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve prepared quite a bit, but on our side there\u2019s a warrior who can fight in close-combat\u2026!\u201dShe picked up a magic reagent that was quite valuable and threw it at the chandelier the middle of the hall.- Clink!- FWOOOOOOOOSH!* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *A heavy magical energy permeated throughout the room. A reagent made by chopping up chestnut flowers along with brown mushrooms that was given a \u2018discharging\u2019 spell. The effect itself was so famous that everyone knew what would happen.The restraint of diffusing the magic power in the area.The temporary suppression of the byproducts created by using magic power.A drug that was like a magician\u2019s natural enemy.The principle of it was that, by twisting the flow of magic power irregularly, it would become difficult to use. It wouldn\u2019t work for middle-high class magicians who had a high proficiency in Mana Resonance, and the effect itself only lasted for a few minutes at most, so it was hard to use unless it was a short-term battle.However, her opponent was only using beginner magic. It was the perfect time to use it. Taylee clearly must have understood that fact, as he quickly took an offensive stance.The wall of flames that had filled the hallway was now fading away.Across the chandelier, hidden in the dust and ash, was a man covered in blood.A hunting dagger was held in one of his hands, and in the other was the dangling corpse of a rabbit whose body was as large as his own.He was covered in the rabbit\u2019s blood as he kicked the corpse with his foot. The rabbit rolled over on the floor, quickly turning to ash and disappearing. She had bought enough time, her part was done. For the amount of effort that she put into making it, the results weren\u2019t that bad.The man\u2019s right shoulder was scarred from the rabbit\u2019s teeth, and his uniform was covered in blood.However, he was still standing there as he watched the party without any change to his expression or movements. Just looking in his eyes was terrifying.\u201cEd Rothstaylor!\u201dTaylee ran at him, shouting as Elvira checked the labels on the reagent bottles one by one.The chestnut flower reagent that she had used would interfere with using magic power in this hall for a while. It was a fatal blow to the magicians, Ayla and Ed. However, since Ayla\u2019s power was rather weak in the first place, it was worth it.For Taylee, who used swordsmanship, and Elvira, who used magic tools and reagents, this was a brief moment where they had significantly more power.Right now, it was their turn to attack and deliver a fatal blow to Ed.- Clang!However, Ed Rothstaylor didn\u2019t intend to block Taylee. Instead, he kicked down the cabinet next to him.The thick liquid from inside the basin quickly began to flow across the hall. It was the preparations that he had asked Kelly for in advance\u2026\u201cThis smell\u2026 It\u2019s oil! Taylee!\u201d-Fwooosh!Ed kicked a candlestick in the corner of the hall and knocked it over. The oil began to catch on fire. A new source of light swept over the dark hall as a new fire began to take over the space.This wasn\u2019t a magic flame that was caused by \u2018Ignite\u2019. It was a real, oil-based fire. The wooden parts of the chandelier, as well as the cabinets lined up along the walls, began to catch on fire.\u201cAre you crazy? This is Ophelis Hall!\u201dElvira shouted at him.Unlike the pillar of fire that he created using \u2018Ignite\u2019, the flame that was burning now was the equivalent of a natural disaster. It would burn every single thing here equally.If the fire ended up spreading to the hallways, there could even be casualties.Thinking of that, she quickly looked around and once again, goosebumps ran over her skin.Since it all happened so quickly, she didn\u2019t have time to check properly.There were less cabinets in the hall than there usually were. Also, most of the excessively combustible pieces of furniture and valuables had been removed in advance, minimizing the number, and the smoke that was building up blocking their view was actually being let out by the open windows near the emergency stairs.As said before, the floor and walls of the main hall were all made out of marble, and the main entrance and door leading to the hallway were all made of antique stone. As long as this place remained closed off, there was a place for the fumes to go out, and a means to block the smell, a fire of this magnitude wouldn\u2019t even be noticed from the hallway. It was just a couple of cabinets that were burning in this magnificent hall.The fact that the fire in this hall had been prepared in advance, so that it wouldn\u2019t spread any further\u2026What did that mean?\u201cEverything was planned, even to this point\u2026!\u201dElvira clenched her teeth as she gathered her reagent bottles. Flames were flaring out as a bright red light filled the hall. In the center of it all, she could see the blond, bleeding fallen aristocrat.If he had planned for this, he could have done it from the start.If he hadn\u2019t used \u2018Ignite\u2019 to create a fire he could control with magic in the first place, Elvira wouldn\u2019t have used the chestnut flower reagent.If there was a reason for him to progress the situation\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s right! You can\u2019t use magic anymore!\u201dTaylee yelled out again from the burning flames.The biggest variable that was restricting Taylee\u2019s movements was the presence of Ayla. As long as there was no way for him to target Ayla from a safe distance, Taylee wouldn\u2019t have any issue in closing the distance.The heat of the burning flames was intense, but for Taylee, who was born to the ways of the sword, it was easy to cut through the flames.Elvira was completely aware of the sense of confusion and discomfort that was creeping down her spine.Though their opponent was just a regular 2nd year magic student, he was against a warrior that used swordsmanship and a top student from the alchemy department. Just emphasizing the difference in power was hilarious.But the way he handled everything thus far was too flawless.It was as if he already knew everything about his opponents. If they were to act in a certain way, then he was already prepared for it and had another move already prepared.From neutralizing Elvira\u2019s magic tools first, then making it difficult for Taylee to close the distance, to always being out of range of Ayla\u2019s attacks\u2026 There was no flaw in his plan and there was no waste of movement in executing it.Just how much fighting power they had, to what strategy they would use, or where their psychological weak spots were, even to what was in Elvira\u2019s bag. It felt like he had known every single thing. It felt as if they were standing there, bare naked, and Elvira\u2019s sense of confusion was only making things worse.Magicians were usually people who got flustered and ended up making mistakes the moment their magic was blocked.However, his method of fighting closed the gap in specs and controlled the battlefield\u2026 He was more like a tactician than a magician.If that was the case, then the current situation was strange.Without being able to use any magic, he was just a useless piece of paper in front of Taylee, who was like a burning fire.With just one prepared stance and perfectly timed attack, Taylee could cut down the flames and break towards Ed. If he did that, he would be able to see his movement at a glance and even receive Elvira\u2019s support.If that was the case, that brief moment would be the key. But Ed Rothstaylor was no longer able to use magic\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t, Taylee!\u201dThinking that far ahead, Elvira screamed at him.However, Taylee had already started to use \u2018Elemental Slash\u2019 to cut through the fire and narrow the distance to Ed\u2026 He had too much energy pushing forward, and he could no longer stop now.Progressing the situation this far meant that he still had a \u2018hidden card\u2019 left over\u2026!He could somehow still attack, even without using magic\u2026 There was a physical long-range attack that Taylee and the rest of his party didn\u2019t know about!It was too late. Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s hand was revealed as Taylee cut through the flames with his sword\u2026 there was a bow. He must have put it in the fallen cabinet in advance.That bow\u2026 He knew how to use it?He had already finished taking aim.Taylee would not be defeated by a single arrow. He could just swing the sword using his natural reflexes to simply deflect the arrow. Rather than limiting Taylee\u2019s movements, it could only create the opportunity for Ed to counter attack.Therefore, in order to restrict Taylee\u2019s movements, he wouldn\u2019t have been aiming at Taylee. Instead, it would be aimed at Taylee\u2019s companion, who was sitting far away in the corner of the hall.\u201cAyla\u2026!\u201dBy the time he realized, it was too late. The bowstring was released, loosing the arrow. It flew relentlessly towards its target.One of the most common things that 1st year students learned was beginner defense magic.It was a magic that minimized the \u2018physical power\u2019 that strikes one\u2019s body. It was also a type of magic that Ayla could use, but\u2026 coincidentally, Elvira\u2019s chestnut flower reagent was effective against all magicians\u2014friend and foe alike.An arrow flew at Ayla, who had no method to defend. Taylee used near superhuman reflexes to turn around and rush towards Ayla, but there was no way he could be faster than an arrow that was already flying through the air.- Phwoosh! Crash!But that arrow never reached Ayla.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dThe sound of a glass marble breaking was heard.Elvira had more than 20 types of magic tools, and this was one of them: \u2018Claw Hand\u2019.It was a glass marble that had the power to attract small objects towards it, even from a distance, as long as it was within her field of vision.The arrow that was flying towards the hallway towards Ayla suddenly lost strength as it fell into Elvira\u2019s hand.\u201cFinish him, Taylee!\u201dAs soon as he saw that, Taylee turned towards Ed with his eyes full of rage.Elvira didn\u2019t want to think about what was happening any more. No matter how much he wanted to stop Taylee and his party from entering, crashing down a chandelier and setting everything on fire was just crazy.Wasn\u2019t this just supposed to be a demonstration of the lower students occupying the building?She didn\u2019t know what else was happening upstairs for him to go to this far to prevent them from going any further in Ophelis Hall, but\u2026 shooting an arrow at Ayla was completely over the line. That was completely different than just simply threatening them with magic.If such an arrow had penetrated Ayla\u2019s fragile body, it may have even killed her. That act was clearly a crime.Thinking about it, Elvira tightened her grip on the arrow. And the moment she looked at the end of the arrow\u2026 her breath caught.The arrowhead had been removed.The arrowhead, which was supposed to be sharp and made of iron, was cut off. A bit of hay was even tied around it to offset the physical force as much as possible.It was a clear sign that he was trying to eliminate any sort of lethality.Did he already know that it would be too hard for them to check the state of the arrow in such a high-pressure situation?Of course, if you are unlucky then you could be blinded or injured just by the impact from the shaft. But even then, the direction in which he was aiming was between the lower abdomen and thigh, where there were very few vital points. At worst, if you were unlucky, you would just be left with a bruise.\u201cWas he going easy on us\u2026?\u201dThinking that far, once again Elvira screamed at Taylee.\u201cTaylee! Watch out! He still\u2026\u201dThe moment she was about to say \u2018He still has something left\u2026\u2019-CLANG!On the 2nd floor, the sound of a wall being broken and a coward\u2019s scream filled the air.When he came to his senses, Ed had already been struck by Taylee and was hanging against a wall.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dSitting quietly and leaning against the wall while watching Ed, whose body was covered in blood, trying to recover\u2026 Elvira once again had a strong feeling that something was wrong.* * *\u201cAre you insane?\u201dThe chandelier was broken and most of the cabinets were burned. Ed sat against the wall of the main hall, which was a complete mess, and shook off his blood-stained clothes\u2026 but he still remained as expressionless as always.\u201cThere must be a reason why you did all of this!\u201dTaylee fist trembled as he screamed at Ed.Watching them, Elvira stayed silent.After he was defeated, the obvious result of a match between a magician and a close-combat warrior, Ed eventually gave Taylee and his team access to the upper floors.Though they had a hard time, they managed to defeat him.However, Elvira didn\u2019t feel a sense of relief inside her at all.Throughout the battle, Elvira\u2019s heart\u2026 It kept on feeling like it was getting looked into, over and over again.It felt as if the entire battle played out into Ed\u2019s hands.If Ed Rothstaylor was really trying to defeat Taylee, then he would have knocked the chandelier down without ever revealing himself.It may have been different if he was just a foolish magician that was trying to show off his skills, but the difference in Ed\u2019s appearance during the fight was indescribable.She couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he had some sort of hidden agenda.Taylee and Ayla seemed unable to think that far ahead due to the urgency of the situation, but Elvira was completely stiff, contrary to her usual childish appearance.\u2018As expected, something is strange.\u2019Elvira looked at his face from behind Taylee, who was screaming in anger.Despite his loss, he didn\u2019t feel any sort of resentment. He was truly just sitting against the wall, waiting for Taylee to stop screaming.After a while, Taylee took a deep breath as he managed his emotions. Then Ed spoke, raising his head.\u201cAre you done?\u201dEven though the situation has come this far, he never once lost that calm tone to his voice.\u201cIf you\u2019re done, go on up already. Stop whining.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t even telling them not to go up.\u201cWhat did you say\u2026?\u201dElvira pushed Taylee out of the way as she stood right before Ed, looking down on him. Coming this far, she couldn't help but ask him.\u201cWhy did you go easy on us?\u201dEd\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change a bit at that question. Rather, it was Taylee and Ayla who were surprised by it.\u201cWhat do you mean, Elvira?\u201d\u201cThis person? Went easy? On us?\u201dElvira continued glaring straight at Ed, ignoring Taylee and Ayla\u2019s questions.\u201cAnswer me.\u201dAgain, there was a moment of silence. But Elvira was unwilling to break it.She continued to stare at him as she leaned against the wall, refusing to move until Ed responded.But of course, she couldn\u2019t keep on questioning him forever.- Thud!!The main entrance of Ophelis Hall opened up again.The soft sound of the rain falling against the outer wall was briefly buried by the sound of the heavy rain coming through the main entrance.Lighting struck.In that brief moment, everything was illuminated. A girl stood there, struggling to shake off the water that fell on her hood. The girl who had stayed up all night picking her persimmon hairpin was revealed from the darkness.Who could scold such a foolish, love-struck girl? It may have all been in her head, but even imagining such things was all her own choice.However, the difference between one\u2019s imagination and reality is sometimes cruel.The boy who she had thought would show up to the pavilion looking handsome had been attacked by a group of people and collapsed on the floor, covered in his own blood.Against the backdrop of the pouring rain, the girl\u2019s expression in the darkness suddenly went cold.Her usually bright and lively eyes were now empty, full of darkness.\u201c...What are you doing?\u201dWith a heavy voice, she questioned them.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (5)\u201cSomething that I need to take care of suddenly came up, so I might be a little late. I\u2019ll be there as fast as I can, so please just wait a little longer. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt would be a lie to say that something didn\u2019t feel right.From the tone of his voice in the note he left her, it was clear to her that Ed Rothstaylor had gotten caught up in some unexpected trouble.Nevertheless, Yennekar put away her worries about Ed Rothstaylor. He was someone that was always able to deal with any crisis or problem in a smooth manner.He never took any unnecessary actions and would always finish the job quickly. Whether it was simply chopping firewood or making tools for survival, to intervening in the student center\u2019s subjugation team that was in a tough spot because of Yennekar\u2019s mistake.Ed Rothstaylor was someone who had created a certain expectation around himself that he could somehow solve any problem, no matter how big or small.Only after being stabbed in one\u2019s blind spot, hidden in their complacency, is one able to truly reflect on themselves.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely help you then.\u201dShe remembered when she told Ed those words, sitting in his camp and looking up at the stars.She meant for him to ask her for help whenever something difficult arose, or if there was something too burdensome for him to take on alone.Yennekar Palerover was fully aware of her own strength. She didn\u2019t often reveal it because of her humble and sympathetic nature, but\u2026 she had complete confidence that she would surely be of help to him in the event of a crisis.But Ed Rothstaylor never asked her for help.He fought until the point where he was covered in blood, but ultimately ended up collapsing with a beaten body. He had ignored Yennekar, who had told him that she would always lend him a hand whenever he needed it, and fought by himself to the very end.What was the reason for that?What was the reason he left her a letter that was so unusual, why he made sure that she was outside of Ophelis Hall, and why he had to fight here, to the point that he was bleeding?She didn\u2019t know what was happening in Ophelis Hall, but she wondered if he was just trying to make sure that she wasn\u2019t involved.Yennekar Palerover\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t at the level that Ed would need to worry about it.However, Yennekar had already been given various disciplinary actions due to the Glasskan Incident. Creating any more trouble here would only ruin all of the hard work that her peers put in to support her and to make sure that she would only receive a light punishment.Seeing Ed Rothstaylor fighting all the way to the end, until he was completely covered in blood\u2026 If Yennekar saw such a thing, would she be able to hold herself back? She immediately shook her head.That was why Ed Rothstaylor had made sure to push Yennekar away from the battlefield.Considering that, an unbearable anger surged from inside Yennekar\u2019s chest.She didn\u2019t know why Ed Rothstaylor was fighting until things became like this. However, at the very least she knew quite well that he was not the type of person who would commit irrational actions or evil deeds like the rumors claimed that he would.What was she doing while Ed Rothstaylor was fighting here, to this extent?While someone was walking out towards a battlefield by himself, what was Yennekar thinking?She worried about her clothes, making her hair nice, and the color of her hairpin, all while she stayed up late at night in excitement, as her imagination went wild like any other girl who had fallen in love.The direction of her anger was towards herself.But right now, it was the time to put that anger aside.Shwaaaaaaa!With her back to the sound of the falling rain and her head lowered, she quietly asked Taylee and the rest of the party a single question.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThere was a chill in her voice.\u201cYennekar?\u201dTaylee was the first to respond.It went without saying, but at this point there was no way for Taylee to understand Yennekar\u2019s feelings.\u201cThankfully you didn\u2019t get caught up in this situation, Yennekar! Right now, Ophelis Hall is being occupied by other students. But\u2026 I don\u2019t think it will simply end like this. Seeing as Ed went this far to stop us, that must mean there\u2019s something else\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dWith her head down, it was hard to see Yennekar\u2019s eyes. However, the fact that she was glaring directly at them was obvious.At that moment, a huge amount of magic power fluctuated around the main entrance of Ophelis Hall.The mana resonance level of the 2nd year magic department\u2019s top student was impressive enough to even make alumni stare in awe. Her collar stood up as the wind hit her skin. The small chandeliers on the ceiling began to shake like crazy as they threatened to crash down next to the main chandelier.\u201cWh-What?!\u201d\u201cYennekar! What are you doing?!\u201dShe didn\u2019t summon the high-ranking fire spirit Takan.Because of its enormous power, it hadn\u2019t fully recovered from the damage caused by its previous battle.Though, she didn\u2019t need to borrow the power of a high-ranking spirit against three 1st year students.Mid-ranking fire spirit Olgoas, mid-ranking wind spirit Pesci, mid-ranking water spirit Flan, mid-ranking earth spirit Tyke.The four mid-ranking spirits were summoned together to deal with Taylee\u2019s party.Besides those four, many other fluid spirits and lower spirits also began to rise, creating what looked like an army.On the 1st floor, the windows began to shatter as the wind swept around. The rain mixed with the pieces of glass that was caught up in the storm of mana that shook the entire main hall.\u201cGet a grip, Taylee! She\u2019s an enemy!\u201dElvira, who was the first one to realize the situation, quickly picked up all of the reagent bottles. She put them, one by one, into the hole of her torn alchemy bag. The rain was flying around like crazy and obscuring their vision.\u201cYou know\u2026 What you guys were doing, I wasn\u2019t even curious about at all.\u201dWhat Yennekar wanted wasn\u2019t that complicated.Did you guys do that to Ed?To that extent\u2026 She didn\u2019t ask that question in such a straightforward manner.What was happening at Ophelis Hall, and what Taylee and the rest of his party were thinking of by trying to enter Ophelis Hall, was no longer Yennekar\u2019s concern.\u201cYennekar!\u201dThrough the wind and rain, she heard that boy\u2019s voice.He couldn\u2019t hold himself up properly, but from the bottom of his throat he was able to squeeze out Yennekar\u2019s name.Seeing the boy\u2019s wrecked body, Yennekar's heart was struck with pain. She didn\u2019t want him to use his strength unnecessarily, so she quietly responded to Ed.\u201cJust wait one minute, Ed.\u201dAt most, it would be just a minute.That was more than enough time to sort this situation out.It was obvious that the aftermath would lead to the destruction of Ophelis Hall, hurt her juniors, and would break school rules. Nevertheless, the thing that was pushing Yennekar to go to such extremes was her past self.She wanted to live up to expectations, she never wanted to harm others, and would always try her hardest for the people close to her. That was most definitely who she saw in the mirror.On the other side, reflected in the mirror was Ed. Ed, who was trying to take on all the work by himself for Yennekar\u2019s sake, to the point that he collapsed, covered in blood.His appearance was what had triggered Yennekar Palerover\u2019s wrath.Yennekar knew herself just how sad and grief-stricken she was, which is why she couldn\u2019t leave Ed Rothstaylor like that.An eagle made of fire, a raging lion formed by the wind, a giant shaped by water, and a horse created with mud all stood for their summoner. Each and every one of them was a mid-ranking spirit that could only be defeated with 4-5 people rushing it.Taylee and his party began to break into a cold sweat as they took their stances.\u201cWe have to run away, Taylee.\u201dElvira understood the situation.She didn\u2019t know why Yennekar was so angry, but knew that it would only be suicide to attack that ridiculously powerful magician.Even Lortel, who was one of the members of class A who was also known to be one of the best in terms of delicately managing magic power\u2026 She couldn\u2019t even let out a sound in front of that monster.\u201cLet\u2019s just accept the obvious. There\u2019s no way that we can pass through here.\u201dAn unexpected presence. Ed Rothstaylor, the fallen aristocrat that was guarding the 1st floor of Ophelis Hall.It took a long time to defeat him, even with their overwhelming difference in power, but now even the 2nd year top student had shown up, summoning mid-ranking spirits. It would be ridiculous to get themselves any further involved in this situation just because of a few expensive herbs.\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2019s right, but\u2026\u201dHowever, Taylee couldn\u2019t get rid of that uncomfortable feeling.It seemed that whatever was happening now in Ophelis Hall wasn\u2019t just a simple occupation. He was sure that there was some greater darkness hiding behind it\u2026 he sensed the presence of a black curtain.In Taylee\u2019s position, this might have been someone else\u2019s matter to deal with. It was a completely different story if it meant that there were actually going to be students that would be harmed.Taylee\u2019s sense of justice was innate, and his dominant attitude in the face of hardship was a quality that would drag him to his grave.It was obvious that Taylee was going to live the life of a protagonist.The huge wall that stood in his way, Yennekar Palerover, was one he had experienced before. Could he simply overcome the overwhelming difference in power with just tenacity?However, that uncertainty wasn\u2019t important to Taylee.Taylee was a person who would always act in accordance with what he believed was right. He even survived seemingly impossible hardships and evils doing so.However, Taylee\u2019s recklessness could only be seen as correct, because the world had recognized him as the protagonist.However he managed to overcome hardships, Taylee would end up growing because of it\u2026 So as long as the storyline of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 kept moving forward without breaking, the cycle would continue to repeat as he grew.However, the Yennekar that he once again met was an enemy that was outside of that \u2018storyline\u2019.Would Taylee\u2019s disposition as the protagonist end up being ruined because of this enemy, who showed up outside of the original flow of the story? Could he even overcome this trial, full of overwhelming strength, that was standing before him with just his disposition alone?As everyone knows, hardships in real life are never as easy to overcome as in a game\u2019s dramatic storyline.If there was a severe power difference, then defeat was only natural. A sudden awakening of power, the interference of an opportunity granted by fate, a development that allowed one to accidentally overcome a trial\u2026 those were all just moments added to a game scenario.\u201cTaylee! Get a grip! Face reality already! Since all the windows are broken, let's get out that way\u2026\u201d\u201cGo while you can\u2026!\u201dIt was Ed Rothstaylor who stood up and interrupted Elvira.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *\u201cYennekar! It\u2019s fine! I\u2019m alright, so calm down!\u201dYennekar was boiling with rage to the very top of her head, looking like a disaster waiting to happen.The hem of her robe was fluttering and her light pink hair was completely wet, making her look like a ghost that had climbed out of a swamp.My plan was to just send Taylee upstairs as I went to sit down under the rose garden\u2019s pavilion with Yennekar. I planned to talk with her and watch the occupation at Ophelis Hall come to an end.I even left a note for her, promising that I would be there soon\u2014just in case she was going to go somewhere else.I thought that if I made such a promise and apologized then Yennekar, who was born naive and kind, wouldn\u2019t leave her spot\u2026 I don\u2019t know what happened for her to come back to Ophelis Hall.In any case, Yennekar\u2019s kindness ended up backfiring.I thought that we had gotten pretty close after talking about all sorts of things as we spent time together back at the camp\u2026 But she was also a great person, one who would never sit back after her friend had been beaten up to a pulp like this.If I didn\u2019t do something about this, Taylee and his party would end up getting beaten up.\u201cListen. I\u2019ll take care of Yennekar, so you guys go upstairs to the 2nd floor as you planned.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAyla Triss looked at me with a face full of shock.\u201cJust a bit ago you were trying so hard to block our path, but now you want us to just go to the 2nd floor?\u201dIn the first place, I had just used a few tricks to test out Taylee\u2019s specs. If he didn\u2019t have high enough specs to clear Act 2, then there would have been an issue. That was the only reason I did it.\u201cI changed my mind, so hurry and go up.\u201d\u201cHahaha. Really? You\u2019re going to stop those spirits? Your body is completely covered in injuries right now.\u201dI walked over to Elvira, who was laughing her heart out at the situation, and thumped her on the head. Elvira took a step back, clasping her head as she let out a pained sound.\u201cTake your reagents. I\u2019m sorry that I tore up your bag.\u201dThe various effects from the reagents that Elvira had was going to be useful in the battle against the twin maids on the 3rd floor. Elvira was the most troublesome opponent of members in this Ophelis Hall subjugation team, so I had to make sure to seal her reagents first so she couldn\u2019t fight\u2026 I didn\u2019t think there would be anyone this annoying to deal with later on.In the first place, the occupation of Ophelis Hall wasn\u2019t that difficult of an event. It looked like they had enough power, so it was fine to relax and loosen up for the remainder of it.\u201cWh-What\u2026? This, and then that, just what\u2026?!\u201dElvira looked at me, completely dumbfounded. However, I couldn\u2019t keep worrying about her.I made my way to the center of the hall, through the rain and wind that was full of broken glass from the windows.I could only see Yennekar\u2019s eyes through the swarming spirits. Her cold eyes were completely different from usual.Anyway, the reason why Yennekar was so angry was because of her natural personality.That was something that having good personal connections also meant\u2026Thankfully, I was already friendly enough with Yennekar to be considered close to her.Knowing lots of people was the best advantage that you could have in your life.Relationships that came from family, school, or even fate\u2026! The trinity of personal connections\u2026! I was always grateful for them, as they could overcome the frustrations of life.No matter how rich, capable, or respected your family might be, you should always remain humble and nice to the people around you. You could never know how they would come back to repay you\u2026!Now was the time for me to benefit from that personal connection with her.I walked straight towards Yennekar.All sorts of spirits filled the hall, but they didn\u2019t care about the ones that their master wasn\u2019t hostile towards.I walked straight in front of Yennekar, pushing through the gap.\u201cEd, don\u2019t push yourself too hard. Just stay to the side, I\u2019ll finish up the rest.\u201d\u201cYennekar.\u201d\u201cYou can explain the details to me later. First, I\u2019ll quickly finish this up and we can get you treated\u2026\u201dI put my hand on Yennekar\u2019s shoulder and clearly said,\u201cI\u2019m really okay, so you don't have to go overboard.\u201dThe sudden skinship could be considered a symbol of rudeness. I knew just how burdensome it was for someone to put their hand on your shoulder without saying anything, staring straight at you.However, when dealing with someone whose emotions were out of control and their ears closed, it was necessary to make such a gesture to have them hear you out.\u201cUh? Ehh?!\u201dOnly then did Yennekar start to go back to her regular self, little by little.\u201cE-Ed! Your hand! Your hand is on my shoulder!\u201d\u201cYennekar\u2026 First, get rid of the spirits. The wind is too strong, so I\u2019m having a hard time standing\u2026\u201d\u201cUh, yeah?! Of course. It must be hard for you to stand up. I\u2019m sorry\u2026! What did I do\u2026? I\u2019m such an idiot\u2026\u201dAfter that, it all happened in an instant.The raging storm of magic power quickly died down, and all the spirits waiting for their master\u2019s order to attack disappeared.After a while, the main hall of Ophelis Hall was once again filled with the sound of the falling rain.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTaylee and his party were staring, completely stunned, as I quickly waved my hand at them.They all looked as if they had seen a ghost.At this rate, they might end up missing Clevius, who was wandering around on the 2nd floor. If that happened, it would be troublesome to deal with.\u201cHurry and go\u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much time left\u2026\u201dSaying that, I finally lost all of my strength.The completely confused Yennekar was frantically holding my collapsed body up.* * *Shwaaaa\u201cI\u2019m really upset.\u201dThe pouring rain only added to the atmosphere.Sitting and holding her knees, Yennekar\u2019s voice was low and didn\u2019t sound very good.The main hall on the 1st floor Ophelis Hall was a complete mess. Taylee and his party went up the stairs to the 2nd floor while Yennekar and I sat alone, leaning against the wall and listening to the rain.We looked quite funny as we were both completely drenched, but\u2026 sometimes, after getting rained on, for some reason you could feel a sense of freedom and exaltation.Anyway, I thought that Taylee\u2019s specs were growing quite well. There didn\u2019t seem to be any issues.Looking at the range of his \u2018Elemental Slash\u2019, as well as the speed and precision in which he struck, I could figure it out\u2026 It seemed that all of the regular events had been completed well.Of course, from my point of view he wasn\u2019t completely perfect. But that was only because I was someone who would completely foster my specs to the furthest extent\u2026 I should have just been happy that he had attained the specs to be able to clear it.In any case, for a short while it would just be a matter of mental strength. As the story progressed, it would push a human\u2019s sanity to its furthest.Professor Glasts\u2019 Celestial magic would trap Taylee in the cracks of time, causing him to experience hundreds and thousands of deaths.Lucy\u2019s supreme-rank magic would put Taylee on the brink of death, and Mebula, who was the evil god summoned by the head of House Krepin, would trap him in his worst nightmare.Despite that, even in the ordeals that would test one\u2019s mind to its limits, Taylee would never give in.I had said it quite a few times already, but\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to take on such hardships.I was planning to just take care of myself and rake in the success, but\u2026 when I came to my senses, things had become like this. As expected, not everything in the world goes as planned.\u201cWhy do you never say anything and get hurt? I told you to come talk to me if there was something going on\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was a reason for it this time. Next time, I\u2019ll tell you everything\u2026\u201dI persuaded Yennekar, who was twisting my arm to go see a therapist immediately, as we sat on the 1st floor of the main hall and waited for the event to come to an end.Though it was originally supposed to be in the rose garden, now we were waiting in the main hall of Ophelis Hall to check if there were any possible variables, and if everything was going as planned.For quite some time, I sat next to Yennekar as we watched the rain pour down outside the half-destroyed main hall.Although there were some variables, somehow we passed the 1st floor event safely and Taylee\u2019s specs were growing without any issues.The job itself went as I had planned\u2026\u201cThey really went too far. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but there shouldn\u2019t ever be a reason to attack someone to this extent. Next time we meet, I\u2019m going to get really angry at them.\u201dIt was completely understandable that Yennekar would say such a thing, as she didn\u2019t know about the chandelier I made fall\u2026 or the fire that I set\u2026 or the arrow that I shot.I was grateful that she was unconditionally on my side, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable explaining everything that happened to her.Well, it would be fine to put it aside and do it later.\u201cAnyway\u2026 Ed\u2026 Don\u2019t go around getting hurt, okay? You got it? Promise me.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thanks for worrying about me.\u201dConsidering that, I calmed down and let myself rest. It was a little different from what I had planned, but in the end I had done my part as the 1st floor boss\u2026Now, I could take a break and take care of the work at my camp.I felt a sense of relief, listening to the sound of the rain.My heart felt a little more at ease.That was, until I heard what Yennekar had to say.\u201cBy the way, Ed. When I was sitting in the rose garden, I saw a very big carriage.\u201cIt went by so quickly that I couldn't see it well, but\u2026 There was a golden crown on it. Thinking about it carefully\u2026 isn\u2019t that a carriage from the Elte Store?\u201cI read about it in a book long ago. That golden crown\u2026 For sure, the head of the Elte Store\u2026 That\u2019s the pattern for \u2018The Golden King, Elte\u2019, right?\u201dThe fake boss \u2018The Golden King, Elte\u2019, who would leave the stage after being stabbed in the back by Lortel in the event that took place after the occupation of Ophelis Hall: \u2018The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal.\u2019The fact that he had arrived in Silvenia way before it was planned\u2026It was completely outside my range of knowledge\u2026 That meant that something unexpected must have happened.Once again, I started to get anxious.* * *\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt anywhere else, are you, Taylee?\u201d\u201cYea, I\u2019m okay. Ayla also seems fine. What about you, Elvira? Do you have enough reagents?\u201d\u201cI have enough, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dOphelis Hall that was still getting rained on.The three members of the subjugation team climbed the stairs as they checked on each other\u2019s strength and healed any wounds they had.They had felt that something was happening in Ophelis Hall, but they needed to make sure of that fact.At least from the 1st floor, the fact that Ed Rothstaylor went to such extremes to stop them was unusual.It was too tiring to face off against Ed Rothstaylor, since it was impossible to figure out what he was thinking or feeling. Even Yennekar Palerover was about to enter the fight as their enemy.They couldn't figure out what was happening yet, but they wouldn\u2019t let down their guard any further.From the next floor, the enemies who would be blocking Taylee and his party would be just as difficult and complicated as on the 1st floor\u2026 Or maybe they could be even more troublesome. Just thinking about it gave them goosebumps.Nevertheless, they had no intention of going back down.Calming themselves, the group continued to climb up the stairs. They couldn\u2019t ever let their guard down.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (6)\u201cYou know, Elris? I got dumped.\u201dThe fifth floor hallway of Ophelis Hall was home to the equipment storage and the maid lounge. Other than that, it only had a utility room and was as quiet as always, despite the events occurring downstairs.In the first place, the student\u2019s had no reason to go up to the 5th floor. All of the housing rooms were downstairs, and most of the maids were trapped in the 4th floor conference room, so the spacious hallways on the 5th floor were completely quiet.A commotion was heard from downstairs. It seemed that Ed Rothstaylor had blown things up on a bigger scale than she had originally thought. The bigger the situation, the better news it was for Lortel.Before long, the cries of the scared Clevius were heard as the students trapped in their rooms became more and more anxious. If the situation became any worse, they would eventually break down their walls and escape.Elris stood modestly in the dark and looked at the girl speaking to her.\u201cElris, you know him too. The one who seems a bit evil and mean when you first look at him.\u201d\u201cYou mean Young Master Ed? The person we met at that camp last time?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the type of person you like? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s pretty good looking, but it\u2019s not like that.\u201dLortel Kehelland was sitting on top of a wooden cabinet in the equipment storage, drying her hair. She had just finished checking on the situation, to make sure everything was going as planned.\u201cThe smell I get from you, Elris. I thought that I had smelled it coming from him, too. But he ended up making a bunch of emotional comments, which wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cHe ended up throwing it all away without hesitation. Saying that I was responsible for my own choices.\u201dLortel lifted up her hair, sweeping it away with a smile.\u201cPeople that are like us live by hearing those words.\u201dElris could neither nod nor shake her head at hearing those words.Elris was the head maid of Ophelis Hall, who has served as a veteran maid for over 20 years.At the young age of 15, when she didn\u2019t know anything, she began her career as an apprentice maid. She later became a manager at Ophelis Hall, as she was recognized for her ability relative to her age.All of the veteran maids held a great level of wisdom, including her. That was why such people couldn\u2019t be easily bought with money.If you wanted them to do something that went against the beliefs engrained deep in their hearts, you would need to spend a large sum of money\u2014enough to destroy those values.That was where the largest investment was made to forcefully increase the scale of the occupation of Ophelis Hall event.Abandoning the job that she had been loyal to her entire life, increasing the scale of the situation, then destroying Ophelis Hall while taking all of the responsibility for these crimes\u2026If you wanted her to commit such crimes, then you would need a large enough sum of money that would pay for all of the crimes committed and give her a life where she would no longer have to worry about money.Thanks to that, there was a large hole in the books of Elte Store\u2019s Silvenia Branch. Appropriate investments were essential for greater profits, but it was too much of a loss to just purchase the loyalty of a mere veteran level employee at Silvenia Academy. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to make up.But Lortel didn\u2019t waste that expense at all.It was not simply for the sake of an investment or for a greater profit. It was a part of a series of actions that was also an act, to find people that were just like her.She had seen numerous people that would break their own faith by being attracted to mere gold coins.They were those that were usually at the end of their rope, or those who were only living their lives, dedicated to small, meaningless beliefs and values.Such people were not worth being called the same type of person as her.The real proof was those who threw away their stubborn beliefs and values that they had devoted their entire lives to in the face of those gold coins.The more noble and valuable those beliefs and values were, the more Lortel\u2019s heart would pound in excitement. That was the only way for her to relieve her sense of loneliness.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re here, Elris.\u201dEven the veteran maid, who had served the students at Opehlis Hall for more than 20 years, crumbled in the face of greed.In front of a tower of golden coins, whatever honorable values she had were lost.Lortel knew all too well that it was all just useless self-consolation.A life that was led by following gold coins and throwing away everything else\u2026 It was nothing more than a psychological defense mechanism to survive living such a life.Despite her awareness of it, Lortel never stopped searching for her own kind.\u201cWithout you, how could I have ever established such a plan?\u201dThere was no need to stress just how much the involvement of the head maid of Ophelis Hall had contributed as a variable in this situation.\u201cAs things are going, as long as we match the timing of the representative of the lower students, Willain, who is in the 4th floor management room, and half-heartedly give him ownership of the defensive magic that is spread out, then\u2026 One way or another, Ophelis Hall will be destroyed.\u201dConsidering the people Lortel had trampled on all her life thus far just to survive, this level was nothing more than a bit cute.On a straw mat that was laid out in the ghettos, or in the rush of merchants that were risking their lives for a single gold coin\u2026She lived a life where, if she didn\u2019t stab someone in the back first, she would be stabbed to death.However, even if it was done just to survive, there was no justification for such an evil deed.Saying that it was just a means of survival to protect oneself\u2026 Although it may be considered commonplace, that didn\u2019t mean that it was justified.\u201cThe situation seems to be going as planned, so I\u2019ll just stay here in the storage room. I have to act like a good student, one that is simply afraid of the ongoing situation and doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why I hid up here in the storage room in the first place.\u201d\u201cI understand, Ms. Lortel.\u201dRegardless of her unfortunate past and the circumstances that pushed her to the corner, Lortel was clearly a villain and a black curtain.If the afterlife happened to exist, she would surely burn in hell forever.She was neither understood nor did she deserve sympathy. Lortel knew that fact all too well.So in the end, the thing that she was looking for was one of her own kind.She desperately wanted a companion, one who would sink to the bottom of the swamp with her.Though she knew that there was no way such a person existed.\u2018You\u2019re such a pathetic person.\u2019\u2018You\u2019ll die in solitude, alone for the rest of your life, never loving someone else like a girl your age should. Or will you have someone that\u2019s like family, who you can open your heart up to?\u2019Elris sighed with regret at that fact.\u2026 She then took out her rapier and pointed it at Lortel.\u201cMs. Lortel. Thinking about it, let me tell you something.\u201dAt this point, for a magician to deal with a sword that was pointed at them at this distance\u2026 It could no longer be considered a fight.\u201cI am not someone like you.\u201d* * *\u201c...It\u2019s not as difficult as I thought.\u201dOphelis Hall\u2019s third floor hallway.It was still raining heavily outside the window.Walking alongside Taylee, they continued to move forward.Taylee, Ayla, Elvira, Clevius.They had caught Clevius, who was running away on the 2nd floor, and forced him to join their party.On the third floor, \u2018Kelly, who is in charge of washing bedding\u2019 blocked the parties' way. However, she was defeated in a timely manner.- \u201cI am sorry, Ms. Elris\u2026 I couldn't finish what you entrusted me with\u2026\u201dKelly kept talking to herself until they had tied her up and thrown her into a corner of the hallway.Come to think of it, where did her twin sister, Shaney, who was with Kelly almost every day, go off to?Of course, Taylee hadn\u2019t considered it up to that point.\u201cAt this pace, we\u2019ll be there in no time\u2026\u201dAnd in no time at all, they had arrived on the 4th floor.Was it because they were nervous? They felt that things were going much better than they had thought.In the first place, the 1st floor\u2019s difficulty was, oddly, way too difficult. Since then, nobody had tried to strategically attack Taylee\u2019s weakness.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dElvira had an expressionless look on her face, unlike her usual self.She kept on thinking of that 2nd year magician, in the midst of burning flames, standing there with his blood soaked shirt rolled up.His experienced movements, which gave her goosebumps, were the complete opposite of his appearance at the entrance examination. There, he had been rolling on the floor in a disgraceful manner. That fact kept bothering her.Elvira was someone that was full of pride. The fact that Ed had lost on purpose left a stain on her arrogant character, but she didn\u2019t completely lose her temper.\u2018It\u2019s bothering me. I\u2019m sure that he was hiding his true skills.\u2019It seemed necessary to confirm that fact.Once Elvira became curious, she wouldn\u2019t stop, no matter the difficulties. Clearly, Ed Rothstaylor had a hidden side that Elvira didn\u2019t know about.\u201cR-Run away\u201d\u201cKaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghk!\u201dElvira\u2019s worries only lasted for a moment.At the end of the hallway on the 4th floor, a crowd of lower students were pouring out. They all started to run past Taylee in complete terror as they went towards Ophelis Hall\u2019s exit.\u201cThe defensive magic is going wild!\u201d\u201cWillain\u2019s such an idiot! I told him not to touch it carelessly!\u201d\u201cShit! Where are all the maids who are supposed to be managing the defensive magic?! Whatever, let's just get out of here!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know! I really didn\u2019t know that this would happen!\u201dThe students that came running out screaming like that turned the hallway in a complete mess in no time at all.\u201cW-Wait! What?! What\u2019s wrong with you all?!\u201dTaylee shouted as he tried to stop the students, but it was impossible.The ground started to shake as Ophelis Hall began to vibrate, little by little.In the corner of the hallway on the 4th floor, by the entrance of the management room, a situation occurred.The 3rd year magic department student, representative of the lower students, Willain.All sorts of defensive spells were curling around his body, spells that were so delicate to deal with that even experienced magicians wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Usually, it was just a spell that could be easily managed with just four to five maids who had a decent level of mana resonance.Since it was an emergency barrier system for the entirety of Ophelis Hall, unless you were someone who had clear authority, it wasn\u2019t something that you could just access. It was not natural at all for Willain to be taken over by such a spell.It was all a scheme created by Elris and Lortel, who had left the crystal bead that activated the management system of that spell in the middle of the management room.\u201cAg-gghk! H-Help me!\u201dWillain staggered as his body was wrapped up and pressured by the spell. When he would swing his arm to one side, all sorts of magic circles engraved on the walls and ceilings were triggered, completely breaking down the outer wall on one side of the hallway.With a loud crash, dust rose and rain began to fall inside the hallway.\u201cI can\u2019t handle it! Save me!\u201dWillian slipped and fell on his face in an unsightly manner. That ended up actually being some sort of triggering method, as it began to blow out the ceiling and break down the other wall.All across Ophelis Hall, self-defensive mechanisms were carved into the stone. It was originally designed to protect the students, who held a noble status, from outside invaders.But now, it was like putting a weapon in the hands of a child without teaching them the dangers of using it improperly, and that weapon was pointed directly at the wielder.\u201cFirst off, we have to knock that delusional Willain unconscious! In his current state, it will be too difficult to get rid of each magic circle one by one!\u201dEven though her practical magic power resonance was quite low, Ayla was an excellent source when it came to magical knowledge. She quickly grasped the ongoing situation.As soon as she finished explaining, Taylee nodded his head and jumped out. He was thinking of lowering his sword and beating Willain with the backside of it.\u201cKaaaaghk!\u201dHowever, if you suddenly jump out like that, no matter who it was, it was only natural that they would be taken aback and position themselves in a defensive stance. In doing so, it ended up triggering another magic circle.Baaaaam!Taylee got knocked back by a wave of magic power that flew out from the windows and the bathroom door. He fell down but quickly stood back up, taking his stance. However, a new spell began to fill the halls, following Willain\u2019s scream.\u2018Wind Bomb\u2019, \u2018Ignite\u2019, \u2018Earth Wall\u2019, \u2018Shadow Blade\u2019, \u2018Earthquake\u2019.All sorts of magic circles began to activate, creating complete chaos in the hallway and also cutting off access to Willain.Needless to say, all the various murals, the wooden cabinets that were lined up against the walls, and the walls and floors themselves ended up broken and torn.Meanwhile, the students that were stuck in their rooms were already trembling from the sound of the chandelier falling earlier. Their patience would eventually reach its limit.- \u201cWhat the hell is going on out there?!\u201d- \u201cIf I stay here like this, won\u2019t something really bad happen?! I\u2019m going to break down the wall and get out of here!\u201d- \u201cJust what the hell are the maids doing?\u201dBoom!In a room in the corner of the second floor, a girl broke through her wall as she started to evacuate.This was clearly different from the time Clevius did it. This time, the building really was about to collapse. They would just end up dying if they kept on sitting in their rooms like that.Crash!Boom!As several people began to break through the walls, the students soon got caught up in the crowd as they started escaping from their rooms in different ways.Students on the 1st floor broke their windows and ran out into the rain. On the higher floors, the students who could use flying magic or had the skills to safely land after jumping out from such a height broke their windows and left.Students who couldn\u2019t do that broke down the outer wall of the hallway instead, or used their magic power to cast a brief spatial-type magic that broke the floor, falling safely down to the 1st floor.BOOOOOM!Bang! Bang! Pwooosh!Screeeech! Pssskt! Pssskt!The sound of destruction that echoed throughout Ophelis Hall seemed like it would never end. All the students kept evacuating in all sorts of different ways to protect their lives.Taylee\u2019s party had a feeling that things were going well, but despite that, the violence of the defensive magic circle that Willian was in control of never stopped as it continued its destruction.\u201cElvira! Do you have any chestnut flower reagents left?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say something so idiotic, Taylee! That reagent only twists the magic power of a magician, it doesn\u2019t work against pre-carved magic circles!\u201dElvira clicked her tongue as she lowered her body. She then sprayed a reagent around her feet that was made by mixing and melting the eggs of a devil fish with the mashed shell of emperor clams. In the center of it, energy from the magic power began to rise as all the different types of beginner magic that came from the defensive magic circles were temporarily blocked.It wasn\u2019t very practical because of its short range, but in such a narrow hallway it was a reagent that did its job well enough.\u201cAnyway, that defensive magic circle is only a secondary type of magic! The amount it has is quite amazing, but the power itself is bearable! Break through and knock Willain out!\u201dSaying that, Elvira quickly grabbed Clevius, who was hiding quietly behind the wreckage of a cabinet, by the collar.\u201cAgggghk! Kaaaagkh! What\u2019s this?! I thought nobody knew!\u201d\u201cYou idiot, Clevius! It\u2019s because you always try to hide whenever you have the chance!\u201dElvira kicked Clevius in his ass as she yelled at Taylee.\u201cWith the two of you rushing in, you guys should be enough to defeat him! I\u2019ll support you from the back, so hurry up and defeat Willian before the damage gets any worse!\u201dTaylee nodded his head at the remark while Clevius remained completely dumbfounded.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *Crumble!Boom!The outer walls of Ophelis hall were falling down. The battle against the 4th floor boss had begun.Considering the fact that, other than the 5th floor boss Elris, the difficulty wasn\u2019t all that high\u2026 It wasn\u2019t long before the occupation of Ophelis Hall would be over.\u201cEd, where are you going?! Your wounds are going to open!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad! Most of this isn\u2019t even my blood!\u201dI ran around Ophelis Hall in the rain as Yennekar quickly followed behind me.A little while after, I found a large carriage standing in front of a staff passageway behind Ophelis Hall.The carriage, with its various gilded edges, looked expensive and dazzling at first glance. But considering who was inside, it couldn\u2019t be much more frugal than this.Originally, when that man would travel somewhere he would come with at least ten of these carriages. Coming here with only one carriage meant that something urgent had come up, so he had shot out like an arrow.Looking at the carriage, it seemed as if it had been standing still for a long time. Almost as if\u2026 he was waiting for Ophelis Hall to be destroyed.Eventually, from the staff exit, a woman that was neatly dressed in a maid uniform came out holding an umbrella.\u2018Shaney, who is in charge of dishes.\u2019She was one of the orphans brought up by the head maid Elris. She should have been on the 3rd floor of Ophelis Hall with her sister, Kelly, stopping Taylee\u2019s party.However, unlike the original storyline, Shaney had run away from the scene and was now knocking on the door of the carriage.The story was going off track. And this was clear evidence of that.As Shaney took a step back and curtsied, a skinny gentleman from inside opened the door and exited the carriage. He was Victor, an old executive of Elte.Victor opened the door and lifted the umbrella politely, setting the stage for the owner of the carriage to come out.Eventually, he stepped out of that magnificent carriage.He wore a tight-fitting white shirt and leather pants that were tightened with a dark red belt. Honestly, it made him look quite frugal. However, he also had all kinds of gildings and jewels hanging from his coat, as well as jeweled rings on each of his fingers that were as expensive as a house.He was neither young nor old. He had a well-groomed beard that stood out. His dignity was like an extension of his body.The Head of Elte Store, \u2018The Golden King, Elte.\u2019I had a hunch.Now, at this spot, this was the starting point for all of the unexpected events.If I remembered correctly, the Golden King Elte only visited Silvenia long after the Occupation of Ophelis Hall. It was during \u2018The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019 event.Elte\u2019s position within the company was being threatened. Because of that, he tried to turn things around with the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal. It was because the Rothstaylor head of house, Krepin Rothstaylor, asked for the book at a ridiculous price.However, he was eventually sent off after being stabbed in the back by Lortel. After that, he ended his life as a merchant.And yet, he was at Ophelis Hall.I didn\u2019t know the process, and I was only left with the end result.What had happened, and where did it take place? How it had all ended up getting this twisted was completely beyond my understanding. It would have been arrogant to try and figure it all out at this point.However, it was possible to infer what would happen in the future.Maid Shaney and Maid Kelly, the twins who were completely loyal to Head Maid Elris.Amongst them, the fact that Shaney was already in contact with the Golden King Elte this soon meant\u2026 That Head Maid Elris and the Golden King Elte were secretly in contact with each other.But in the original timeline, it was clear that Head Maid Elris had been completely bought out by Lortel.She received a huge sum of money from her and took on the entire responsibility for not properly managing Opehlis Hall\u2019s defensive magic circle.After receiving various disciplinary actions, as well as punishment from the workplace that she had been loyal to for decades, she had completely let go of her career.She was not a person that could be simply bought over with a bit of money. Elris was a person who held firm beliefs and values.Though, how Lortel ended up being able to buy over such a person through money wasn\u2019t explained in much detail. I had just assumed that she must have given her a ridiculously large sum of money.In the first place, Lortel was able to entice even the most noble and honorable of men to break their faith in the face of money.However, the scene I was looking at was clearly different from the original timeline. That definitely looked like\u2026\u201cEd\u2026 You\u2019ll catch a cold\u2026! Your body temperature is also dropping because you lost so much blood!\u201dYennekar, who followed after me, took off the shawl that was under her robe and approached me, quickly wrapping it around me.\u201cYou\u2019re making me so upset! Seriously!\u201d\u201cYennekar.\u201d\u201cUh, hm?\u201dThis is not a situation in which I could just sit still. I hadn\u2019t figured it all out yet, but I could predict enough of what would happen in the future.\u201cI have a favor to ask you. It\u2019s urgent, and it might be too much for me to handle by myself.\u201dWith her arms stretched out, wrapping the shawl over me, Yennekar kept listening to me absent-mindedly\u2026 then she tilted her head.It was clear what Yennekar\u2019s answer would be. Hearing something like that, out of the blue, most people would ask about the situation first\u2014saying things like, \u2018What is it? Is it urgent? What did you get caught up in? Explain the situation first.\u2019How could I explain it so that Yennekar would agree to help\u2026? How could I explain the gist of the situation in a short time and in as much detail as possible\u2026? While I was thinking about how I should explain, Yennekar immediately replied.\u201cAlright.\u201dWas it because she was being considerate, since I said it was urgent? Or did she really just not care about things like that from the beginning?\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dShe skipped all the usual questions, and asked me straight up, in such a cool way, exactly what she needed to do. I thought to myself that I had really made such a great friend.* * *[ Letter sent to Elte Kehelland ]Greetings, most honorable head of the Elte Store, the Golden King, Elte Kehelland.My name is Elris, and I am the head maid at the prestigious Silvienia Academy\u2019s Ophelis Hall.When you finish reading this letter, it will burn to ashes with an Ignite magic circle that is imprinted on it. Please be careful, so that you do not get burnt.Even though we have not yet met, the reason I am writing to you, who must be extremely busy, is because of your adopted daughter, Ms. Lortel Kehelland.In order to purchase the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019 as you had ordered, she is creating a financial crisis in Silvenia's academic affairs department by inducing the destruction of Ophelis Hall.The plan is progressing at a fast pace. Sooner or later, it is certain that I, Elris, the head maid here at Ophelis Hall, will fulfill my duty.If the plan ends well, Silvenia\u2019s academic affairs\u2019 finances will be in a tight spot. Thus, the Elte Store will have an overwhelming advantage in regards to the purchase of the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal.\u2019However, \u2018for a certain reason\u2019 I have come to know her true intentions.Mr. Elte. Your adopted daughter, Ms. Lortel Kehelland, is not your ally. You must never trust her.She knows the truth. She knows that you killed her biological parents. I also know about the fact that you had recognized her talent, drove her life into a corner, and forced her to take your hand.She is planning to coax the top six Elte merchants and executives without your knowledge to force you to step down as the head of Elte Store.The negotiations for the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal is also bait to attract your attention to Silvenia Academy, thus preventing you from dealing with any unexpected events that may occur at any moment back at Elte\u2019s headquarters.I am keeping the secret letters from her room, as it could later serve as evidence.Though she thinks that she definitely burned them in the incinerator before disposing of them, it\u2019s the maid's job to light the incinerator.No matter how thorough she was, she would have never thought that the maids of Ophelis Hall would go through each scrap of paper that went into the incinerator.I am always prepared for her.No matter which way this situation ends up going, I will be punished for my failure at properly managing Ophelis Hall.If I give out Lortel\u2019s name, then I will not be the only one who falls into hell.However, there is no such thing as free work in this world.On the condition that I remain silent on the matter, I was promised a huge sum of gold coins by her.The only thing that would block a huge sum of gold coins would be an even larger sum of gold coins.The content I have listed on the attached paper are the names of the \u2018organizations\u2019 I secretly and regularly manage. The number of gold coins that are delivered to those organizations will determine my actions.I am losing my eyesight and, for some reason, I have almost completely lost my sense of hearing. There is no reason for me to explain the reason in detail, but this year will probably be the last that I can work as the head maid.I am the only person who knows all of the facts of this situation, and I am someone who is in a tight spot with no one supporting me anymore. Depending on which side I\u2019m going to support, the situation may become either more complicated or simpler.I hope you will be merciful and judge wisely.- Sincerely, Ophelis Hall\u2019s Head Maid, Elris[ Attached Sheet ]Seren Region, Crook\u2019s OrphanageKohelton Orphan ShelterAthens Crocell Orphan ShelterOdell Region, Alton OrphanageTemil Region, Public Orphan Shelter* * *\u201cEd\u2026! You\u2019re injured! If you move too fast, your wounds will open up\u2026!\u201dWhat I had come to realize was that the variables in the world were too complex to control all of them.All I could do was give my best effort. All I was doing was taking care of the larger variables, so that there wouldn\u2019t be any problems.While pushing through the rain with Yennekar, I was organizing my thoughts.I didn\u2019t know why, but\u2026 If Elris had really betrayed Lortel, it was safe to say that the fall of Lortel would be inevitable.How important was Lortel Kehelland to the original timeline?In Act 3, she needed to confront Princess Penia and lead a political battle within the school. She had an important role in gathering talents for the right mountain\u2019s scouting mission. And she played an active role as a representative of the top forces during the Lucy Subjugation\u2026 She was someone that held a tremendous level of importance.In Act 4, she had the position of being one of the helpers on the protagonist\u2019s team, which would develop into a great friendly force that would directly confront the Rothstaylor family\u2026 Other than that, she had a major influence in other, smaller episodes as well. It would be impossible to list them all.The fall of Lortel.It is just one sentence that would break down the entirety of all those scenarios.Lortel Kehelland disappearing from the storyline\u2026 That was a dark world that I would have no information about. Future knowledge and my informational advantage would completely collapse, and I wouldn\u2019t be left with a single advantage.But if I could completely fill in the role of Lortel\u2026 It might have been possible, but it would be a very difficult and arduous road. I\u2019d been saying this like it was some sort of habit, but it was already hard enough for me to make ends meet. Adding in that kind of hard work was something I absolutely rejected.Unless I was planning to give up on my degree at this school and go out to live a life in an unknown fantasy world\u2026 Lortel Kehelland\u2019s exit from the story was absolutely unacceptable.\u201cYennekar, do you happen to know where Ziggs\u2019 room is? I think I am going to need to ask him for help as well.\u201d\u201cUhmm? Well\u2026. Since we aren\u2019t that close\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201c... Alright, we\u2019ll just have to look everywhere then. He may have already escaped from the building.\u201dWiping the rain running down my face, we came back to the main entrance of Ophelis Hall. The evacuated students were running around screaming, unsure of what to do.The occupation of Ophelis Hall was coming to an end.Since the defensive magic had been activated, the faculty would be arriving in a few minutes.Lortel Kehelland was a person that couldn\u2019t be sympathized with or understood just because she had fallen. No matter how dramatic her situation may be, she was a true villain.Encouraging good and punishing evil, the universe corrects all wrongs, justice will always triumph.All of those were true sayings, but we had to ignore the lessons that came from such folktales for now.The existence of a black curtain that covered all the truth on the stage was indispensable.Nobody knew what direction the villain's missing storyline would go, or how the snowball would roll. It could end up destroying the world.In the falling rain, at the main entrance of Ophelis Hall.Thinking of how to deal with the situation to the best of my ability, I looked up at the half-destroyed Ophelis Hall with Yennekar.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (7)\u201cUgh-Heeeek! Heeeeeeek!\u201dThe injured Taylee was holding Willain down on the floor. By attacking with Clevius, he succeeded in cutting through the magic circles and was finally able to get close to Willain.However, Ophelis Hall was already a complete mess. Precious, expensive pieces of furniture and art had fallen on the floor. The outer wall was covered in holes that looked like stars, and no longer intact.Taylee knocked Willain unconscious and tied him up, letting out a sigh as he wiped the rain from his face.The outer wall on the fourth floor hallway was completely destroyed. Because of that, they were exposed to the pouring rain. The party was soaking wet as they kept wiping their faces.\u201cPhew. Isn\u2019t it almost over, then? We just have to wait for the faculty to come.\u201d\u201cNo, Taylee. Something\u2019s definitely not right.\u201dHearing Elvira\u2019s words, Taylee appeared puzzled.\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou felt that something was wrong as well, Taylee. Not just anyone can access Ophelis Hall\u2019s defensive magic circle. You would have to be at least the general manager of the building or the head maid to be able to use these magic circles to your heart's content, without facing any disruption.\u201d\u201cThen that means\u2026?\u201d\u201cI haven't finished yet. There\u2019s a black curtain that made this happen.\u201dHowever, after coming all the way to the end of the hallway on the fourth floor of Ophelis Hall, there wasn\u2019t a single person left that could be their enemy.That meant that all that was left was the stairs to the fifth floor.\u201cThe real culprit must be on the fifth floor. If we don\u2019t catch them before they escape, then what would have been the point to all of our suffering? After coming this far, I\u2019m going to finish the job and get a reward from the school.\u201dElvira rolled up her sleeves as she walked towards the staircase. Clevius was shouting, asking \u2018What\u2019s the matter now?\u2019 while Ayla was at a complete loss on what to do.\u201cElvira, if it\u2019s as you said\u2026 then that black curtain must be\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It must be Elris, the head maid that takes care of Ophelis Hall. What are you standing around for? It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s on the fifth floor, so let's hurry up and catch her quickly to get rid of all these defensive magic circles.\u201dTaylee sighed as he was ordered around by Elvira. After going through everything that they had and coming all the way here, it wasn\u2019t like he could ignore it.There certainly seemed to be a black curtain behind the entire occupation of Ophelis Hall incident. Thinking about it, it was clear that Elris\u2014the head maid\u2014was the culprit.* * *There was no such thing as kindness without reason or faith without a basis in the world.It was such a natural understanding for Lortel that she had never once doubted it.She lived in the world of business, where you would get stabbed in the back the moment you let your guard down.Lortel was someone who had never experienced family, siblings, close friendship, or camaraderie. For her, a relationship built on trust was always a rationally designed structure based on thorough evidence.Therefore, a relationship where one trusts each other unconditionally was like a flower that bloomed on a cliff.It existed, but it couldn\u2019t be reached\u2026 A treasure that existed only in one's imagination.She was not obsessed with it, because she couldn\u2019t reach it. Obsession was a feeling that formed from nearly being short of reaching it.The only realistic option for her was to increase the number of people that were just like her.People who would break their values and sell their beliefs for money. Those who provide evidence to the fact that there was no unconditional trust or favor. That was what was important to her.While her perception might have been wrong and twisted, it wasn\u2019t a particularly bad thing.But once in a while, even something as sturdy as steel would shake.Even though his life was teetering on the edge of a cliff, there was a man who returned the three golden coins that she had placed in his hand.Even though he agreed to Lortel\u2019s plan for twenty gold goins, his expression showed that he had little interest in money in the first place.That man\u2019s code of conduct was far from the vocabulary of market value, payability, economics, rationality, etc.In fact, there were a lot of people like that. They were human beings who acted emotionally, risking their lives for loyalty and love. Rather than being cool-headed, they were foolish people.But Ed Rothstaylor didn\u2019t seem to be like that. He was not a man who got swayed by his emotions like Ziggs, nor was he as nice as Yennekar. That wasn\u2019t to say that he wasn\u2019t swayed by money, so seeing such a person made her heart fill with the desire to bring him in as one of her own.The smell of another person just like her that had been constantly tickling her nose, filling Lortel with certainty. It was the conviction that he would be the same as her.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou should be responsible for your own choices, Lortel.\u201dBut just like that, she was dumped.What was surprising was that, instead of feeling frustration or anger, she felt a sense of relief.As she had often said before, there were too many sources of light in Silvenia Academy. It was completely different from the world of business that she lived in.When you walk through a garden full of the smell of flowers, you often risk mistaking the smell of those fragrant flowers as coming from your own self. No matter how hard she tried to remind herself that she was just a sewer rat walking through the sewers, her heart was broken.Looking at people like Taylee and Ayla, Ziggs and Elka, the feelings that she had rejected before were once again rising up inside of her.Jealousy.Obsession.She wondered if the day would ever come that she would be able to build a trusting relationship, free from bias and personal interest. In fact, the cliff where that flower had bloomed wasn\u2019t all that high or steep.Let\u2019s not dream about such things. I am a villain who will stay in a world run by business, backstabbing other people until the day I die.\u00a0That was a promise that she swore by.Looking at Ed and Yennekar, the desire that had been buried deep inside her was finally completely awakened.\u201cDon\u2019t move. Soon, Mr. Elte will arrive at Ophelis Hall.\u201dThe result was a rapier pointed at her neck.Elris, the head maid of Ophelis Hall, was a senior worker who had spent most of her life at Silvenia. However, her health was deteriorated by heavy work and a chronic illness. It tortured her endlessly. She had asked the school to adjust the amount of work, but\u2026 There were only a few people who had the experience to take on the work for her.The management of Ophelis Hall, which was full of distinguished guests, must always be steady and safe. Elris' life has been a constant sacrifice for the goal of making sure that system was stable.On the day they had made the backdoor deal, approaching Elris and watching her tell her backstory\u2026 Lortel had also ended up revealing her own story.That was a mistake that she would have never made in the world of business. She had hastily come to the conclusion that they could embrace and understand each other\u2019s pain. When she visited Ed\u2019s camp, accompanied by Elris, they were even able to share their feelings together.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect you to react in such a way. I thought you were a bit more cold hearted\u2026 Well, that\u2019s not something I can really say.\u201dWhat expression did Lortel show? Lortel herself didn\u2019t know, so she didn\u2019t try to understand.\u201cMiss Lortel, you said that you were going to get revenge against the Golden King Elte. However, I apologize. From my point of view, you two aren\u2019t that different. There\u2019s no human being in this world without their own personal stories and reasons.\u201dShe closed her eyes and added on.\u201cAnd I am the same.\u201dBang!At that moment, the door to the fifth floor swung open.\u201cI found you, Head Maid Elris!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s holding a hostage! Be careful, Taylee!\u201dTaking advantage of Elris\u2019 astonishment as she looked towards the entrance, Lortel quickly rolled out of her range.\u201cLortel! Are you okay?!\u201dElvira cried out, checking on Lortel.\u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019\u2018Look over there.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s the person behind this entire incident.\u2019\u2018We need to take her down quickly.\u2019It would have been the best choice to quickly put all the blame on Elris and run away\u2026 But Lortel couldn\u2019t open her mouth.\u201cL-Lortel! What\u2019s wrong with your expression?\u201dJust what was the expression on her face? Lortel looked back and forth between Elris, who stood still without an unchanging expression, and her classmates, who were saying things she couldn\u2019t understand.Then, after holding her breath for a while, Lortel ran down to the first floor.The Golden King Elte was coming.Elte\u2019s dismissal plan was in its final stages. If she could just make up some type of excuse, then it would nearly be complete.But if Lortel, the center of the plan, was captured\u2026 it would all be ruined.Lortel\u2019s volition might have been firm, but she was still a girl whose body was extremely fragile. If she was tortured, even just a little, she would confess everything.Every cloud has a silver lining.The good news was that Elte had gone directly to Silvenia.He was not sure of which of his followers had decided to side with Lortel, so he came to deal with the matter himself.If she was able to reach out to anyone back at Elte\u2019s headquarter right then, it would be fine. Lortel knew quite a few commercial executives that were at the head office.The plan was to manipulate the books, steal property, maximize damage, and then hand over the entire responsibility to Elte\u2026 It was already quite a concrete plan. However, the scale was too big, and if Elte himself was at the headquarters then he would definitely find out.Elte intended to defeat Lortel without fail with that trip. The moment he left his seat, he committed to seeing it through to the very end. The dice had been rolled.Lortel needed to head back down to her room on the first floor and send the homing pigeon that she was hiding in secret, then find somewhere she could hide until it was over.Lortel clenched her teeth as she ran down the stairs frantically.A longing that that was at your fingertips, just out of reach, would drive anyone crazy. If it had never touched her fingertips in the first place, she would never have been that obsessed.She couldn\u2019t help it. No matter how cold-blooded she pretended to be, a lack of affection was a deadly poison that would slowly eat away at anyone.It was only then that she realized that there was a difference in the latent period, and that was just a moment of collapse.It was all because of the romanticism at Silvenia Academy. If she had never left her cold-blooded world, that latent period would have lasted much longer.She\u2019d had enough of being betrayed and stabbed in the back. Only now, after going to the Academy, did her heart break and her actions lose consistency.Nevertheless, Lortel had no choice but to continue running away.Either way, she had to run. If Elte arrived at the main lobby on the first floor before she did, the way back to her room would be completely blocked off.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *Slam!!Yennekar\u2019s magic struck the wall as the sound of its collapse rang out.\u201c\u2026\u2026.?\u201dLooking inside the room, she saw Ziggs. He was continuing to work out by himself, despite the urgent situation.As the wall suddenly collapsed, he looked towards me with a puzzled face.\u201cW-What is going on, Ed? This is\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you still in your room when the situation outside is like this\u2026? Didn\u2019t you hear all the noise?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m not going to act rashly. Even if the building collapses, it\u2019s not like I would die anyways.\u201dSince Ziggs was born naturally strong, he didn\u2019t really recognize the situation as a crisis. He thought that the faculty would figure it all out and take care of it themselves, so he could keep on doing what he needed to do.In fact, some of the other students also hadn\u2019t left their rooms. Even if the building did collapse, as long as you had the specs to protect yourself there wasn\u2019t a need to stay out in the rain.\u201cBut Ed, I didn\u2019t expect you to completely break down the wall of my room like that. Won\u2019t it be too cold when I sleep now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re only saying that because you haven\u2019t seen the situation outside. Anyway, this entire building is going to need to be renovated.\u201d\u201cThe situation is that bad?\u201dZiggs stood up from doing his push ups and shook out his arms.Who in the world would think that Ziggs was a magician\u2026?\u201cAh. Yennekar is also here. This is my first time greeting you properly. During the Glasskan incident\u2026 we didn\u2019t really have a good relationship, though.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201dYennekar looked down at the floor, a little hesitant. To Yennekar, that incident was the lowest moment in her life. However, Ziggs was not a good enough person to pretend like it never happened.What happened already happened.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so down, Yennekar. The disciplinary action is already over, you know.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 that\u2019s right. Thanks Ed.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until he heard us exchange such words that he let out a sigh, realizing that he might have brought up something useless.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019ve been doing well since then. You two seem to be on good terms.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI also have enough sense to recognize these things. Ed, aren't you the type that prefers keeping your distance from the 1st years? Well, there are many of my classmates that ignore others if they look even a bit weak\u2026 as an upperclassman, it would only make sense for you to do it, too.\u201dZiggs stretched his body out as he sat back down on the bed, relaxing his legs.\u201cBut seeing you act so comfortable with Yennekar, it\u2019s refreshing to see that new side of yours. Are you two dating?\u201d\u201cNo! No! No! It\u2019s not like that!\u201dAt that moment, Yennekar started to tremble, shaking her arms as she glanced at my face. Perhaps it was because she thought that I denied it too strongly\u2026\u201cE-Ed, does it make you feel bad?\u201d\u201cNo, I'm fine. It was just a rude question from Ziggs.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201dAfter a polite apology from Ziggs, his expression slowly became more serious as he sat on his bed.\u201cSo, there must be a reason why you broke down my wall and came to see me.\u201d\u201cDo me a favor. I promise I\u2019ll pay you back later.\u201d\u201cIn the first place, aren\u2019t I the one who\u2019s in debt?\u201dZiggs responded while letting out a smirk. He was talking about a debt that he has yet to pay off.I decided to respond by bringing up how he had helped me, whenever he had time, with building my cabin and other jobs that required physical labor.\u201cThat\u2026 I just wanted to help you. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s why I did it.\u201dAfter that response, I put on my overcoat.\u201cLooking at this atmosphere, this doesn't seem like it\u2019s going to be an easy job.\u201d* * *According to the original timeline, Elris should have cooperated with Lortel until the end of the Occupation of Ophelis Hall event.There was no immediate way for me to figure out why she was involved with Elte.However, that didn\u2019t mean that there was no answer at all.The battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal, which was meant to happen after the occupation of Ophelis Hall.The school and Elte Store played a game of tug-of-war over the research records related to Celestial Magic, left by the great sage Silvenia. With that event, Lortel\u2019s plan to overthrow Elte would blossom.During Elte\u2019s long stay at Silvenia, the forces aiming to overthrow him would begin gathering at the headquarters of the Elte Store.There\u2019s no better timing than now.Elte tried, but failed, to monopolize the sale of grain from large farms in the northwest region of the Empire. He had also signed an exclusive distribution agreement meant to monopolize cotton with the Collet Store\u2014from the Kingdom of Theron across the sea\u2014but failed again due to a steep drop in prices.No matter how well-informed and callous a merchant might be, it was only natural that they would surely experience failure and have moments where they lose money over the years.If they were unlucky, such incidents could happen three or four times in a row. Though. from the position of a business, this would surely have a negative impact. That would jeopardize even Elte\u2019s position as the head of the store. Especially since he was one to advocate for meritocracy.How long had she been making plans? I didn\u2019t know much about the details.However, at the time of the occupation Lortel\u2019s plan to dismiss Elte should have been nearly complete. As long as she made some type of excuse, everything would be fine. But at that moment Lortel, who was the focal point of the plan, had her feet cut out from under her.Lortel was someone who always handled everything with confidence and rationality. At what point did she make a mistake?First Floor Main Hall.Wham!A group of mercenaries, numbered at about 15 or so, had been hired from the commercial city of Oldek. In the middle of the group was Elte, wearing his luxurious clothes.The size of the group that Elte had brought in was too small for someone of his status. From that alone, I was convinced that Elte didn\u2019t want to make this situation a big deal.\u201cAre you students? Hurry up and evacuate.\u201dI was the only one in the way while blocking Taylee, but this time there were two more with me able to greet him. The 2nd year star student, Yennekar Palerover, and the 1st year runner up, Ziggs Eiffelstein\u2026 Even though they were students, they were both promising individuals that wouldn\u2019t disappoint.Yennekar stood behind me, glancing around as Ziggs stood, leaning against a nearby post.\u201cBy chance\u2026 Are you Sir Elte Kehelland, the head of the Elte Store?\u201dI called out to Elte with a cunning voice. Standing in the center of the mercenaries, the merchant nodded his head as he signaled for us to get out of his way.\u201cNo way! It\u2019s such an honor to meet you. Sir Elte, the merchant who rules over the entire continent. I don\u2019t know why an important figure such as yourself has come all the way to Silvenia, in such a remote location\u2026\u201dThe Golden Daughter, Lorte.The Golden King, Elte.The Head Maid, Elris.In the end, those three were the only ones who fully understood the situation.Lortel, who sought to overthrow Elte, avenge her childhood, and overthrow the head seat.Elte, who was trying to stop Lortel\u2019s plan and succeed in purchasing the Sage\u2019s Seal.And Elris, who was stuck in between those two.After all, the underlying cause for the story going off track was because of Elris\u2019 sudden behavior. The cause was still unknown, but either way, there was no need to run all the way up to the fifth floor and defeat the head maid.Since the rest of the story was still following the original timeline, Taylee\u2019s party should ultimately be able to defeat the head maid. I\u2019d already confirmed that his specs were high enough, and that all of his party members were reliable.With that taken care of, the party that I was in charge of had a duty to take care of Elte.\u201c\u2026 We are making sure that nobody can enter this building. Since the building is at risk of collapsing, for safety reasons nobody is allowed inside until the faculty members arrive.\u201d\u201cDid you get those instructions from the school?\u201d\u201cNo, we are acting at our own discretion. Isn\u2019t this an unexpected situation? Here in Silvenia, when it comes to something like this, we have a system that will award prizes.\u201dThat was a perfect excuse. But Elte would also be able to read the hidden intentions behind it.\u201c\u2026 If someone as noble as you is here, then there must be some justifiable reason. However\u2026 Why don\u2019t you try talking with the school first, and be treated accordingly?\u201dAfter saying all of that, I kept my mouth shut.Elte definitely didn\u2019t want to make the situation too big.It couldn\u2019t be revealed that the black curtain behind the incident was Lortel.No matter how old she was, Lortel still belonged to the Elte Store and was the adopted daughter of Elte.If it turned out that there was any sort of influence from the Elte Store behind this incident\u2026 Then the Elte Store wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the responsibility of covering the cost for restoring the destroyed Ophelis Hall.In the act of trying to trap her enemy, she ended up falling into it herself. If there was a part that the head maid Elris had not recognized, it was that.From Elte\u2019s point of view, just sending Lortel off to hell didn\u2019t mean that everything would be okay.Lortel needed to be handled by Elte himself, not by the school.And the ones who knew the truth behind the incident were Elris, Shaney, Kelly, Willain, and myself. Thus, we also had to be convinced to keep our mouths shut. He still had quite a long way to go.\u201cYou\u2019re on Lortel\u2019s side, aren\u2019t you?\u201dI hadn\u2019t talked to him for too long, but he already noticed that I knew at least some bits of the truth behind the incident.\u201cI\u2019ll give you twice as much gold as that child gave you, right now. So get out of my way.\u201dThis was no time to unnecessarily raise emotions or compromise. Given the conditions of the incident and the urgency of the situation, he quickly named the maximum value that he could. A number that the other person would never be able to refuse.\u201cThank you. But I haven\u2019t even received the gold coins I was promised yet, so what\u2019s the point in paying double of it?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dElte briefly let out a laugh.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a good eye for people. Do you think I\u2019ll treat you special just because you\u2019re loyal to that girl? Were you perhaps bewitched by that child\u2019s beautiful appearance?\u201dAt that, Ziggs smiled and responded with an \u2018Ohhh\u2019 while Yennekar nodded and looked back and forth between me and Elte. She didn\u2019t seem to care about Elte at all.\u201cThat child was born with the blood of a fox. She is someone who stabs others in the back the moment she meets them. I\u2019ve been raising her since she was a child, so I know her better than anyone else. I didn\u2019t expect her to turn that blade against me, not after I took care of her all this time.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s someone that would betray her own father. Instead of being loyal to gold coins that you may or may not receive, take the definite profit that\u2019s laid out in front of you. That would be the only natural and correct choice.\u201dHe then looked into my eyes again. The reason why he didn\u2019t give orders to the mercenaries immediately was probably because he didn\u2019t want to escalate the situation.\u201cOr is there another reason for you to put so much trust in that child?\u201d\u201cDoes there even need to be such a grand reason?\u201d\u201cAlright. I can see that we aren\u2019t communicating.\u201dI didn\u2019t necessarily have a lot of affection towards Lortel.However, there was no way that I could explain to him that it was because of the original timeline. That was why I ended up using a reason based on \u2018just because.\u2019There was no reason other than my belief in her.Elte would click his tongue at such absurd remarks, but I had my own personal reason. And I couldn't ask for his understanding.I lowered my voice and spoke quietly to Yennekar and Ziggs.\u201cI\u2019ll go and check out the situation. Buy me some time.\u201dI left Ziggs, who nodded his head, and Yennekar, who looked a little anxious, behind. Slamming the door behind me, I quickly entered the main lobby.I needed to find Lortel and inform her about the situation.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026 As it turned out, I didn\u2019t need to run around Ophelis Hall.She was already looking at me, her pupils dilated, from the opposite corner from the door. Needless to say, it looked like she had figured out the situation outside as Elte was trying to enter the building.\u201c\u2026 You weren\u2019t able to get out?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t have her usual foxlike smile. Lortel was trying to say something, but her voice wouldn\u2019t come out. Instead, she nodded her head.Her usual appearance\u2014one of calmness and composure, regardless of the crisis\u2014was missing. She was probably surprised at seeing me covered in blood stains from my attempts at blocking Taylee\u2019s entrance.\u201cIt\u2019s good that I don\u2019t need to waste time explaining things. Let\u2019s go around to the back door and get out. Do you still have the energy to run?\u201dThe rain mixed with blood as the rainwater rolled off the back of my hand. I quickly shook it off and swept away my messy bangs, which were getting in the way because of the rain.\u201cDon\u2019t fall behind. Stick with me.\u201dI was getting involved with the main characters of the storyline more than I should, but wasn\u2019t it already an unexpected situation? It was only for the sake of fixing the flow of the story, which was already broken. Afterwards, I would just go back to keeping my distance from them.In the first place, I had already gotten involved to the point that I couldn\u2019t turn back.I nodded my head as I picked up the pace with Lortel.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (8)Goodwill and trust were always accompanied by motive.Slogg, one of the six major merchants of Elte, joined forces with Lortel because he wished to be the next chairman.The Melburak Company\u2019s head, Seton, also joined in on Lortel\u2019s plan. He believed that an internal disruption within Elte Company would bring new change to the power structure of the commercial city of Oldek.The reason that Sharo, a receptionist with the Elte Company, flirted with Lortel was the hope of making money by having her leak information.Kadan, a trade worker, kept approaching Lortel because she often gave him tips.Teeny, a pet dog raised by the school, stuck to Lortel because the food she gave him was of the highest class.Attached to every favor was a motive. At least, that was the case in Lortel\u2019s world.In most cases, if that reason became clear then you could see through other people's intentions and psychology at a glance.There was no blood related family, lover who made promises, or allies that she spent a long time with. Paradoxically, she could maintain a cynical attitude towards all those human relationships because, for Lortel, a person who would do a favor for another without a reason didn\u2019t exist.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s time to discuss the details. But anyway, did Elris betray you?\u201dEven though she knew all of that, she still decided to trust Elris. What a stupid, idiotic mistake to make.Her attitude towards life, one of never completely trusting another person, had become less important.The person that came to mind was Yennekar Palerover\u2026Growing up receiving kindness and love, she was like a princess in a fairytale that treated the world with only that same kindness and love. If you looked at her warm eyes as they stared at Ed Rothstaylor\u2026 She couldn\u2019t help realize that this was the love of a beautiful girl who had not been negatively influenced by the world.Seeing such a thing, she couldn't forget just how dirty she was herself.She shouldn\u2019t have gotten drunk off of the romantic scenery of Silvenia Academy, or allowed it to cause her to mistake herself as one of those beautiful, romantic people.\u201cI saw Shaney meet up with Elte. Wasn\u2019t she a maid loyal to Elris?\u201dEd Rothstaylor kept talking as they ran down the first floor hallway.\u201cBut even then, neither Elris nor Elte would report you to the school. The Golden King Elte obviously wouldn\u2019t want the school to find out that the Elte Company is connected to this incident.\u201dFive people were bribed by Lortel for the occupation of Ophelis Hall.Head Maid Elris, the twin maids Shaney and Kelly, the lower student representative Willain, and the fallen aristocrat Ed.Elris, Shaney, and Kelly all went over to Elte\u2019s side.Ed should have been tempted to join Elte, as well.She suddenly stopped walking. Ed, who was running ahead, quickly looked back with a puzzle expression marring his face.He called back to her.\u201cThere\u2019s no time to waste. What are you doing?\u201dLortel finally calmed down and pulled herself together, forcing a foxlike smile\u2026 She ended up saying something, unsure as to why she said it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ed. I can\u2019t guarantee the twenty gold coins I had promised you before. As you can see, the current situation has become quite precarious.\u201dAfter being betrayed by Elris, her emotions felt strange to her.Lortel hated to admit it. She was now in a psychologically weakened state.If she weren\u2019t in such a state, she wouldn\u2019t be making such a foolish mistake.She didn\u2019t know why Ed Rothstaylor sided with her, rather than with Elte.With that in mind, it was best for her to quickly figure out his intentions and take advantage of him.But she was a fool to make such a confession.\u2018Just what kind of stupid mistake am I making?\u2019She couldn\u2019t believe that she was willing to turn herself in just because there wasn\u2019t a reason for him to be on her side.\u201cWho asked? You\u2019re going to die, so what are you standing around for like this?\u201dHowever, Ed\u2019s way of shutting down Lortel\u2019s words removed her worry.\u201cIf you get caught by Elte now, your life will be over. No matter what you are planning to do in the future, you should run away, first.\u201dEd was dripping blood as he kept on scolding her, standing across the hallway.It must have been her request that he block the first floor that led to Ed being hurt so badly.Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t complain that it was all too much. If it had been her, she would have complained ten times over about how the work was out of her paygrade.\u201cOr do you have a better plan?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you have one, let\u2019s go with it.\u201dThere was no hint of doubt in his voice. He was prepared to follow Lortel to the end.He was so certain of her that he was willing to follow along with anything that she decided.As she had repeatedly said, goodwill and trust were bound to be accompanied by a motive.But that man\u2019s goodwill and trust\u2026 There was no such motive.No matter how rationally she considered it, he definitely should have fallen for Elte\u2019s offer. If he were to ask the same thing of one hundred other people, every single one of them would have taken it.If you couldn\u2019t determine their motive, you shouldn\u2019t believe in them. She didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to her, not fully understanding what he was thinking yet.Just before, she had believed in Elris in the same way. Ultimately, it caused her to make a crucial mistake, resulting in the current situation. She couldn\u2019t repeat the same mistake.However, her mouth began to move on its own. Her inner voice was crying out, trying to stop her, but her heart was a complete wreck at that point. She was unable to hold out any longer.Flying out of her mouth was a confession about the internal affairs of the Elte Company, and the fight for power that was happening inside of it.\u201c\u2026 There was a plan that was being developed at the company\u2019s headquarters to control the market price. It was probably my father who came up with the plan.\u201d\u201cExplain it to me.\u201d\u201cThe market price of equipment plunged after a massive conquest of monsters in the eastern mountains last summer. After buying and monopolizing all the remaining equipment, they repeatedly made internal transactions\u2026\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 Illegal transactions. You can just briefly explain the rest.\u201dEd calmly cut her off in the middle of her explanation.After monopolizing the equipment in the area, mainly in the base of the subjugation forces, they would repeatedly buy and sell the goods at the market.The key was insider trading.The merchants, who were secretly bought out by the Elte Company, had continuously repeated transactions between themselves.If you brought in three merchants\u2014A, B, and C\u2014and had A sell the equipment to B for one gold coin, B would then sell it to C for two gold coins. C would proceed to sell it to A for three, slowly raising the market price.Eventually, the gold coins and equipment would circulate in the hands of the Elte Company as the market price steadily rose.In doing so, the market price could be maintained until the demand rose during the next monster subjugation. Then, they could sell the equipment off for a ridiculous profit.Manipulating the market price by using such a hit-or-miss strategy made sense, and it was a surprisingly classic technique. However, it was an unrealistic method because of the huge amount of capital that it required.\u201cFor the plan, my father took out bonds from Duke Aldogar and Countess Opel. However, by the time the date to pay them back had arrived, the plan for the monster subjugation had been pushed back. It was a situation in which they needed money urgently.\u201d\u201cWas the solution to this problem the Sage\u2019s Seal?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEd was very quick to understand, even though she hadn\u2019t explained much. It felt as if he had studied this beforehand.\u201cMy father\u2026 He told me that he had found someone who would buy the Sage\u2019s Seal for a high price\u2026 So he ordered me to enter Silvenia as a 1st year student and figure out a way to obtain it.\u201d\u201cAlright, I got it. You don\u2019t have to explain any further.\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re fine with just that much?\u201dEd grabbed Lortel by the wrist. He told her it wasn\u2019t the time to be standing still as they began to quickly run through the hallway again.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of talking about all of this after the fact? In order to put the school\u2019s finances in a tight spot, you wanted to increase the scale of the occupation in Ophelis Hall. Then the negotiations for the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal would become a reality, so he would take it as bait. He would come all the way here, leaving Elte\u2019s headquarters empty. You thought about selling off the equipment during that time.\u201dWhile he was running down the hall, he explained the gist of the situation with a surprising amount of accuracy. The speed at which he was able to understand the situation wasn\u2019t normal.Lortel looked at Ed, completely stunned by his remarks. He didn\u2019t seem to care at all.In the end, mutual trust was the key to manipulating the market price through illegal transactions.The act between the three merchants\u2014A, B, and C\u2014was meant to artificially raise the market price by exchanging money and goods among each other.However, it was a business structure that would never be able to be established if even one of the three merchants betrayed the others. It was a situation in which, if one of them ran off with the stock, the other two would get screwed over.A, B, and C were examples, but\u2026 Considering the size of the business and the market, there would be more than a few dozen middle-class merchants involved.Over the previous six months, about a third of them had been placated so that\u2014if the timing was right\u2014a large-scale sale of the equipment could induce a plunge in the market price all at once.It would not be difficult to plunge the price, as it was an artificially created price in the first place. Prices were difficult to raise, but as long as you started selling competitively, they would drop in an instant.For the Elte Company, which had a lot of equipment in stock, the plunge in prices would be recorded as a huge loss.From a very broad perspective, it would only have narrowed the surplus, but in the immediate short term there would be a huge deficit in the trading books.The important thing was the immediate moment. The big picture, which couldn\u2019t be immediately seen, wasn't what was important.Due to the various damages he had caused, Elte\u2014who was already starting to lose his position within the Elte Company\u2014would finally lose his seat.In addition to that, when the allegations about the account book manipulation were added in and the demand for liability over the losses was made, there would be sufficient grounds for his dismissal.Was it possible for Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s to picture all of this in his head, with her saying only that much?No matter how fast the gears in his head might turn, there was a limit to a person\u2019s processing speed. There was no way that he should have been able to picture everything with only Lortel\u2019s brief explanation.\u201cThen there\u2019s only one thing that you have to do.\u201dBut Ed's words were spot on, like always.\u201cYou just have to send a message back to headquarters, telling them to start selling the equipment right away. Right?\u201dIn order to repair the internal assets on such a scale, approval from the shareholders was required.However, when the head left his office, the six major merchants under his command took over the rights for the immediate handling of the business.Slogg, one of the six greats of Elte. An old fox that joined Lortel after being promised a position as the next head of the business.He would happily put a stamp of confirmation on the sale of the equipment, all while keeping a straight face\u2026 and then would be sorry to say that the responsibility all belonged to Elte.Even if Elte angrily tried to punish Slogg, his defeat would already be certain, as the cause of his dismissal was already established.Originally, those plans were supposed to take place during the \u2018The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019 event.The event would end with Lortel smirking under a robe, sitting in the corner of a wobbly wagon as an enraged Elte screamed her name.After that, Act 2 would end after they chased after and took down Professor Glast, who stole the seal and fled to a secret laboratory. That was the main event of the act, on a scale that was much larger.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *\u201cIf we go to my room, there is a homing pigeon. It\u2019s a direct link to the internal forces at headquarters.\u201d\u201cIf we send the homing pigeon off and hide until the sales plan is implemented at headquarters, we\u2019ll win.\u201d\u201cHowever, I\u2019m sure that my father has predicted this to some extent. He\u2019s going to try and capture me tonight, to make me confess to my plans and the names of the traitors that I have on the inside.\u201dThe moment he left his seat, nobody knew what would happen. Even though Elte realized that, he came to Silvenia anyway. At that moment, he wasn\u2019t able to tell who his true allies and who his enemies were.It would have taken place on a smaller scale, without anyone finding out, but the news would have reached the company\u2019s ears in an instant.They had bet everything on each other. The final battle was a chase between father and daughter.\u201cLet's go out the back door, walk along the outer wall, and go through the window into your room.\u201d\u201cI was going to say that, too.\u201d\u201cAlright, we\u2019re on the same page.\u201dThey really communicated well. It was a gentle exchange of opinions that meshed well together.Quick to understand, active in coordination, and not easily swayed by emotions.Lortel gasped as she watched Ed running down the hall, holding onto her wrist.They could see the back door of Ophelis Hall. Although it was not as magnificent as the main entrance, the luxurious patterns and paintings represented the dignity of the building.\u201cListen carefully, Lortel. Since they have already discovered your position, you\u2019re in a tight spot. The best thing for you to do now is to keep hidden and make sure nobody finds you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a separate villa in the Mine region. If I can just catch a carriage up there\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I was Elte, I would have already put people on standby at both bridges out of Acken Island. He\u2019ll absolutely catch you that way.\u201dEd was right.The coachman that drove Lortel\u2019s carriage was a reliable person, but the appearance of the carriage itself was already quite eye-catching.If she passed over the bridge, she would surely be followed.\u201cTalk to the coachman waiting in the commercial district and tell him to send an empty carriage out of Acken Island. Instruct them to abandon the carriage and escape to a safe area. That way, they\u2019ll think that you\u2019re outside of Acken Island for sure.\u201d\u201cThen what about me\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a cabin I built in the north forest. You\u2019ll just have to deal with living there for three days.\u201dIt was always in the last place you would look. The forest right next to Silvenia. Nobody would think that she would be there.\u201cI\u2019ll go to your room and send the homing pigeon. As long as we write a message telling them to \u2018sell it right away\u2019, headquarters will be able to handle the rest of the more complicated issues, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dLike a merchant who had been working with her for a long time, Ed\u2019s movements and actions didn\u2019t waste a single step.When she looked at Ed, who was able to solve every issue, she felt that it would be okay to trust in him and leave everything to him.Even though she knew that such a romantic relationship couldn't be, her broken heart whispered in her ear once more.\u2018This time, it might really work out.\u2019As she had repeatedly stated, obsession was not an emotion that resembled a flower blooming on a distant cliff.It\u2019s something that bloomed at the tip of your fingertips, just out of reach.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEd slowly opened the back door and looked out through the crack, then quietly closed it again.\u201cListen, Lortel. There\u2019s someone watching the back gate.\u201dEd quickly explained the situation in a quiet voice.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing good that will come out of them discovering your location or what you\u2019re planning. So I\u2019ll go out and run towards your room, taking care of it myself. In the meantime, if there\u2019s nobody in sight, run straight to the commercial district. Got it?\u201dLortel hesitated, before nodding her head. Ed furrowed his eyebrows in discontent as he scolded Lortel.\u201cAre you sure your head is in the right place? Why are you so distracted?\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 I understand.\u201dEd grabbed Lortel by her shoulders and pulled her straight against the wall next to them. Lortel's lip began to tremble for a moment, but when she thought about it, she realized that he only did it to keep her out of sight.\u201cOnce you get to the north forest, they won\u2019t be able to keep pursuing you. After that, it\u2019s up to you.\u201dEd opened the back door and turned to leave.\u201cEd.\u201dIt was not until she called out his name that Lortel realized she was flustered.She couldn't stand the idea of not asking him.\u201cJust why, to this extent\u2026 Why are you helping me\u2026?\u201dEvery favor had a motive. Once you figured out that motive, you could see through someone's psychology and principles at just a glance.But asking someone what they were hiding in a straightforward way\u2026 that was a mistake that not even a beginner merchant would make. And yet, those very words came out of Lortel\u2019s mouth.That was because she couldn\u2019t figure it out using common sense. Regardless of what others said, it was only right for Ed Rothstaylor to unconditionally take Elte\u2019s side.Whether it was financial gain, the chances of winning, or for leverage, Lortel was currently inferior in every way.Nevertheless, Ed was on Lortel\u2019s side.Ed frowned for a moment, as if he was wondering how to answer that question.\u201c\u2026 Just because? I just kind of feel like I should, I guess?\u201dHe responded in a vague tone, and then\u2026 He stormed out the back door.Shwaaaaaaaaaa.Boom, Clang!The sound of rain coming in from the open door and the sounds of a battle resonated throughout Ophelis Hall.The noise seemed to be coming from the battle on the fifth floor, between Head Maid Elris and Taylee\u2019s party.Boom, Boom, Boom!The noise from the fierce battle marked the final battle in Ophelis Hall. Lortel had a hunch that Taylee and his party would win. Regardless of the fact their opponent was the head maid of Ophelis Hall, the moment Taylee started using his Swordsmaster skill he would be able to overpower her.After being pushed against the wall, Lortel stayed still for a while longer.She couldn\u2019t figure out what Ed Rothstaylor was thinking at all. There had to be a motive behind every favor and attempts to gain someone\u2019s trust, but she couldn\u2019t see it.There was no financial gain, no ideological reasoning, and he wasn\u2019t the type of person to be swayed by emotions. Just what other reason did he have?\u2018Were you, perhaps, bewitched by that child\u2019s beautiful appearance?\u2019Suddenly, she remembered the interrogation that Elte had given him earlier. However, she quickly shook her head. As she has said before, Ed Rothstaylor wasn\u2019t the type of person who would be driven by his emotions.In the first place, Ed Rothstaylor always had Yennekar Palerover next to him.However, the feeling of unease stemmed from the fact that those two weren\u2019t dating.It was obvious from a glance that Yennekar was always staring passionately at Ed. But\u2026 That feeling of affection seemed to be one-sided.Boom, Boom, Boom!In the background, the sound of the fierce battle continued to echo throughout Ophelis Hall. Lortel slid down the wall and sat down. She was already tired from running, but also from the fact that she was in trouble. Her legs had become weak.\u2018It\u2019s just that. I wanted to help you, so I helped you.\u2019Why did that sentence get so stuck in her heart that she couldn\u2019t breathe?Suddenly, she realized that something was wrong. The building they were in wasn\u2019t shaking at all.Considering the sounds coming from the fight in Ophelis Hall, shouldn\u2019t the building be shaking from the vibrations? Or parts of the building flying off?But looking out the window at the rain pouring down peacefully, Lortel realized the true reason for her sense of unease.Boom, Boom, Boom!She couldn\u2019t believe it, but that sound was actually Lortel\u2019s own heart.* * *Shwaaaaaaa!The rain had begun to slow, which made me think that it would soon come to an end.On the top floor, there was the ongoing final battle between Taylee\u2019s party and the head maid, Elris.On the first floor, Ziggs and Yennekar were probably showcasing their skills as they continued to block Elte.The back gate was far from that sort of flashy battle. Through the dark night air, I could see a maid standing in the rain.How long has she been standing there? Probably in hopes of preventing Lortel from escaping through the back gate, she was just waiting there. She was ready to capture Lortel for the sake of the person she was most loyal to, Elris.The maid\u2019s outfit was completely soaked from the rain and her lavender hair was loose.Slowly looking back to see who it was, it turned out to be Shaney, one of the twin maids that should have blocked Taylee's path as the third floor bosses. She quietly raised her head as she made eye contact with me.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see young master Ed out here. How unexpected.\u201dShe had come out there after hearing Elte\u2019s orders to guard the back gate and block Lortel\u2019s escape route.Without getting rid of her usual cold expression, she pulled out a rapier.Unfortunately for her, I knew Shaney\u2019s abilities and attack patterns like the back of my hand. She was even the type of boss that could only really show off her abilities when she was teaming up with her sister, Kelly. Being separated from her, she could only show off less than half of her actual skill level.Wasn\u2019t it a bit lame for the last hurdle?I confronted Shaney in the pouring rain.The painful occupation incident was finally coming to an end.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39The Occupation of Ophelis Hall (9)Act 2, Chapter 3: The Occupation of Ophelis Hall.The fifth floor boss: the battle against Head Maid ElrisIn the center of the fifth floor hall, Taylee\u2019s party remained as calm and composed as ever.The maid\u2019s well managed appearance remained unchanged. From head to toe, there was not a single spot on her that was messy. Even though the head maid\u2019s outfit was fancier and more decorated than that of the regular maid\u2019s, there still wasn\u2019t a single spot that was ruined.In one hand she held a rapier, heavily decorated with a gorgeous rose pattern. In her other hand, she was gathering mana to cast intermediate magic.Not only that, but all of the defensive magic circles that were protecting Ophelis Hall had returned to her, as Willian had passed out.She had sword skills that could rival those of a combat student, was capable of intermediate magic, and even had access to the defensive magic circles of Ophelis Hall.She was different from Willain, who had been taken over by the magic circles and ended up destroying Ophelis Hall. Being the head maid of Ophelis Hall, she was already familiar with the system and the practical uses of the defensive magic circles.Nevertheless, she could not beat Taylee. After all, Taylee McLaure was the protagonist.Regardless, the final battle of Act 2, Chapter 3 had begun.And in an absurdly quick manner, the conclusion was met.* * *The rain fell onto Shaney\u2019s rapier.I was almost out of mana. I only had enough left to cast basic magic another two or three times.I closed my eyes quietly as I began to remember.Shaney's first strike would be a stab between my lower abdomen and thigh. It would always be the same, even if she were to repeat it a hundred or even thousands of times. That was because all of the maids in Ophelis Hall used the sword in a similar way. Even if they didn\u2019t like it, their body has already come to remember that exact pattern.The rain continued pouring.Shaney\u2019s feet kicked off the ground as she broke through the rain, narrowing the distance between us in an instant.If you looked at the fluttering hem of the maid outfit's puffy skirt from the front, it looked like a blooming flower.In an instant, Shaney twisted her body. The hem of her skirt, which used to resemble petals, curled up and disappeared. While I was unable to determine its whereabouts, a rapier struck my thigh.Well, it\u00a0should\u00a0have struck it.Smash!Instead, Shaney\u2019s rapier was crushed into the ground by my foot.My body responded naturally, even before Shaney approached me. It wasn\u2019t a matter of how fast my reaction speed was, it was because I had the foresight.Shaney's power was primarily optimized to work well with her sister Kelly\u2019s magic.Unlike Kelly, who was in charge of attacking from the back and being their main source of firepower, Shaney took on the role of vanguard. She drew out the holes within the enemy\u2019s defense with her quick and subtle movements.There is almost no direct firepower, and her unnecessarily flashy and dynamic movements were only meant to attract attention. She might have been quite agile and quick, but her muscle strength was rather lacking.\u201cWh-WHAT?!\u201dShe had approached me quickly, thinking I was going to cast magic, but my act of preparing to cast beginner magic was all just a ruse.A magician could never give up distance. That was because magic required one to stand still for a certain amount of time to properly cast it, but it could only happen while maintaining a safe distance.In addition to that, their muscle strength and agility would naturally be greatly inferior when it came to close combat. To sum it up, those who were fighting against magicians were bound to focus on closing the distance.Unfortunately, there was a difference in weight class between Shaney and me.\u201cAghk!\u201dShaney was startled as she tried to take out a dagger, hidden between her thighs.However, my hand reached it first as I stopped her from pulling it out.I bent Shaney\u2019s wrist and kicked the bundle of knives, which were tied to her thigh, with my foot.Clang! Clang!All of her secondary weapons, which she had stored just in case, were now useless.For a brief moment, Shaney\u2019s eyes began to turn red as the flow of mana began to leak around her bent wrist.The twin maids Shaney and Kelly could share some of their skills. It was the privilege granted to the twin sisters born with a blessing of the stars.The dagger that had been knocked onto the floor suddenly began to float in the air. Kelly\u2019s low-ranking telekinesis magic. It was a \u2018living weapon\u2019 that allowed swords, spears, and the like to attack the enemy directly.About four or five daggers began to float up and spin in the air, aiming for me\u2026 Before they suddenly stopped.As Shaney grabbed her rapier and her strength returned to her hand, the daggers rushed towards me. They were rushing at me like birds of prey, but I didn\u2019t look towards them.I lowered my body to protect my vital points and shoved my shoulder into Shaney.Shaney\u2019s magic wasn\u2019t as sophisticated as Kelly\u2019s. She could only borrow that power. In the end, it was still nothing more than an act to attract attention.One by one, daggers flew into my thigh, right shoulder, and forearm. However, it would be ridiculous to say that I had gotten struck as they fell right away. It was like a child throwing something at an adult. The only damage was a small amount of bleeding.I didn\u2019t lessen my strength while I bent Shaney\u2019s wrist.From the beginning, Shaney\u2019s goal was obvious. The flying daggers were just a trick to steal her opponent\u2019s attention and force them to respond. Much of Shaney\u2019s fighting power came from her unique agile movements.Once you took control of those movements, she would never be able to gain the upper hand.My blood started to drip as my elbow rested on her solar plexus, laying on the floor.\u201cCough!\u201dShaney stopped breathing for a moment. I stabbed my nail into her forearm and added some strength to scrape her skin.\u201cKaaaghk!\u201d\u201cEu-Eughaak!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI kicked away her rapier, which was rolling on the floor.She was an opponent that made up for the difference in muscle strength with her sleek movements and high agility. Once she lost her weapons and her movements were suppressed, there was no hope for her.It took less than a minute to get to that point.\u201cEugaaaaaaaaaaagkh!\u201dBut as the rainwater kept on falling into her bloodshot eyes, she grabbed my chest and pushed at me. She kept on scratching me with her fingernails, kicking me in the back with her thigh, which altogether began to drive me mad.\u201cI can\u2019t disappoint Ms. Elris after coming this far! Move! Get out of my way!\u201dHer elegance and polite manners were a thing of the past as she began rolling around on the muddy ground. I wiped my blood off and grabbed Shaney\u2019s neck tightly as I spoke straight to her face.\u201cElris will lose.\u201dThe blood dripping from my face fell onto Shaney\u2019s white cheek. The drops of blood running down her face and around her ears mixed with the rain as it wet the ground.\u201cWhat do you know? What do you know about Ms. Elris?\u201dTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know much.The occupation of Ophelis Hall was just a stepping stone event. The personal backstory of the event boss was beyond my realm of knowledge.\u201cDo you have any idea how much Ms Elris has suffered? Even in this situation, do you even know how hard she fought to stay true to her beliefs?\u201dTo be honest\u2026Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster didn\u2019t go into much depth about Elris\u2019 personal situation.There were many episodes that needed to be processed, so maybe they thought that adding development to each side character would end up increasing the volume too much and slow down the pacing.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s none of my business.\u201dWith those words, Shaney\u2019s eyes widened. Since I didn\u2019t have the answer, I was left speechless. She was not wrong.BOOM!A huge explosion erupted coming from the fifth floor of Ophelis Hall. The white spectacle that lit up the darkness of the late night had clearly come from Taylee\u2019s Swordmaster Skill.The battle against the head maid Elris was nearing its end.Shaney, with her bloodshot eyes, took advantage of my shock and reached her hand out towards my face.She used her fingernail to stab my arm to make me loosen my grip, but I had already grabbed her by the side of her neck and pressed down hard. Little by little, she was starting to run out of breath as she began to faint.In a last ditch effort, she began to scratch at the back of my neck and collarbone like crazy.\u201cYou don\u2019t even know! You don\u2019t even know a thing about Elris! So how can you be on the side of that wicked girl\u2026?!\u201dReaching out her hand, Shaney choked as her voice was filled with hatred.\u201cDo you have any idea how many orphans Elris saved?! I was one of them! If it wasn\u2019t for Elris, I couldn\u2019t have gotten such a job, made any money, or even continued living in the first place!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d\u201cKgh, ughk.\u201dRegardless of the scratches that she made around my face and neck, I kept pushing on Shaney. I was shocked by the hate in her bloodshot eyes, but I didn\u2019t change my expression.\u201cI won\u2019t forgive\u2026 I can\u2019t believe\u2026 Taking\u2026 Lortel\u2019s side\u2026 E-Ed Roths\u2026 Keughkkk\u2026\u201dHer white hands, which were gripping my face, gradually loosened. Both of her arms fell into the mud.I relaxed my grip as I looked down at Shaney, who had fainted.I slowly stood up.My whole body was muddy as the defeated Shaney\u2019s body lay in front of me. Her bloodshot eyes and flowing tears were imprinted into my memory.It was a shame, but I didn\u2019t know any of the extras' storylines. What did she expect me to do when I didn\u2019t know?Just how did Elris end up saving Shaney and Kelly? What did she have to go through to become the head maid of Ophelis Hall? Just how much did Elris struggle through to get there? There was no way for me to find out.Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that story. There was no story in the main storyline that had shed light on them.In the first place, there were many stories in this world that had never been shown.I turned my head and looked up at the half destroyed Ophelis Hall.On the top floor, Elris, who was one of the main people behind this situation, must be getting defeated by Taylee.Nevertheless, the half destroyed Ophelis Hall wouldn\u2019t return.The financial damage had already been done, which would put pressure on the school. Some of the students wouldn\u2019t have a place to live now, so they would end up complaining. And there may have even been some students who had gotten injured by the falling debris.Furthermore, the pressure on the school\u2019s finances may even result in a reduction in student benefits and welfare, the size of scholarships may reduce. A major change in dormitory policy was needed, and some students may even have to give up on their studies.What\u2019s the point in trying to weigh the damages caused by this incident when compared to the relief efforts Elris had done before, just to figure out if she was in the right?Who was Elris to weigh the importance of good and evil, and to what extent could she overlook evil in the decisions she made and the methods she took?Or was she a villain that was on the same level as Lortel or Elte\u2026?People who could make philosophical comments and decide on their own choices in life were those who were living a privileged, fulfilling life.However, my life choices and ultimate goal had never changed, not even once, since I ended up possessing this body.It was to survive.I knew exactly what kind of crazy storyline the world is progressing into.That was why I had taken Lortel\u2019s side to survive. That was it.Unfortunately, there were no profound philosophical reasons for agony or personal morals that went into this decision.As it was with all of the decisions we made in life.[You have defeated Shaney, who is in charge of dishes!][You have acquired the combat-type skill \u2018Pain Endurance\u2019][You have acquired the combat-type skill \u2018Battlefield Vision\u2019]The \u2018Pain Endurance\u2019 skill, which temporarily allowed you to forget pain and delayed the consumption of Vitality.And the \u2018Battlefield Vision\u2019 skill, which allowed you to momentarily process the opponent\u2019s movements in slow motion.\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019ve finally learned it\u2026\u201dIn the pouring rain, I looked at the scratches all over my body while organizing the thoughts of what my next steps were in my head.There was still work that had to be taken care of.I picked up a stone and quickly went on my way again. Now I had to enter Lortel\u2019s room.After that, everything else would be a breeze.Crash!I broke her window as I crawled into Lortel\u2019s room.Crack!Stepping on the fallen glass shards, I looked around Lortel\u2019s room.It was spacious and grand, as expected of a room in Ophelis Hall. On the other hand, it felt a bit awkward.Yennekar\u2019s room, from my memory, was a room full of cute ruffles and pretty decorations, with a variety of things that were just like her\u2026 but her peer\u2019s room, was strangely more business-like.Luxurious pieces of wooden furniture and various decorations seemed to have been arranged out of necessity. Her desk was covered in papers and the books were angled without a single error, resembling soldiers lining up in a row.The gap between Lortel and Yennekar was so clear that I couldn\u2019t help but let out a bitter smile without realizing it.\u201cThat\u2019s so like her.\u201dI spoke to myself as I pulled out a large wooden box from underneath her desk. Inside was a bird cage with, naturally, a bird inside of it.I took out the cage, put it on the desk, and pulled out a pen from the corner of the desk. I flipped over a random piece of paper lying on the desk and began to write.Elte is in Silvenia. It will take at least three days for him to get back to the headquarters.Sell all the equipment that you have secured.I rolled up the piece of paper and put it in a small container tied to the leg of the pigeon.Then, I took out the pigeon and let it spread its wings in freedom.The homing pigeon, which flew through the rain in the night sky, would return with Elte\u2019s head.I was relieved to think that I had finished a major task and sighed.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *It had been a long time since I\u2019d last seen the northern forest.The northern forest. It was a place where I struggled desperately to survive, each and every day. But after going through many trials, I ended up realizing that there was nowhere else like the forest.No matter how shabby and ugly my house was, it was still my house. It was the most comfortable place for me, and there was nothing I could do about it.The rain had nearly stopped. No, it\u00a0had\u00a0stopped.There was a unique atmosphere in the forest right after the rain.Though it wasn't raining, the heavy moisture that pressed down on my skin still remained, making it difficult to move.However, the pleasant feeling of the damp atmosphere was a mystery of vegetation. Thanks to the humidity, it felt like I was a part of the forest as I made my way through the thick scent of grass.However, to claim to be a part of this beautiful nature\u2026 My appearance was too off-putting.A shirt covered in blood, wounds on my thighs and shoulders. The bleeding had stopped, but the blood stains remained as I limped around like a zombie.Still, those kinds of wounds would recover quickly when you considered my past experiences. It was better than being attacked by a wild boar or falling while picking fruits from a tree. As long as I put something over them, then they would heal quickly.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dI let out a deep breath as I began to speed up my steps. It wasn't a trail\u2026 It was just a path, close to the mountain road that cut through the grass.If the entire plan went well, Lortel should have been waiting at the cabin.There wasn\u2019t much time left for Elte. Being in his position, a person couldn\u2019t help but break out in a cold sweat.Before the homing pigeon arrived and the sale went through, he would have to find Lortel and make her admit the truth. It would be in a somewhat violent and cruel way.Originally, it wouldn't have been too difficult.Using common sense, nobody would imagine that the head of the Elte Company would be in such a place at such a time. Neither Lortel nor I did. For a man of his stature, rumors usually would spread a few days ahead of his visit.Without the help of Ziggs and Yennekar, and other events that worked out in my favor, Lortel would have ended up going down a merciless path of failure.Still, there was a fairly high chance of succeeding. That was because time was on Lortel\u2019s side. Somewhere along the path the pigeon would take between that night and the next afternoon was the Maginot line.Once he heard that Lortel\u2019s wagon had escaped outside of Acken Island, Elte definitely wouldn\u2019t stay still.There was no way for him to search from inside of Acken Island calmly in such an urgent situation.There was a high possibility that it would all just be a waste of time, chasing the wagon that escaped while trying to deduce Lortel\u2019s whereabouts and the carriage\u2019s path.Even if he was able to catch the coachman quickly and make him confess her whereabouts, he would then need to turn around and go all the way back to Acken Island. The failure to win at Ophelis Hall would become his bitter, disappointing mistake.\u2018Please, when I return to the cabin, please let Lortel be waiting there.\u2019As I thought that, I suddenly saw a girl at the bottom of the small hill.Maybe it was because of the long night\u2019s hardships, but her reddish colored hair\u2014which usually resembled a blazing flame\u2014had no shine.Her hair, which was tied to one side, had fallen loose. Her wet body didn\u2019t seem to be drying, even though the rain had stopped.A girl who had lived her entire life in a world revolving around golden coins and calculating, understanding, estimating every move. She was the Golden Daughter, so to speak.I couldn\u2019t see her expression as she was wearing a hood.\u201cWow, did you come all the way here to see me? How kind of you.\u201dI playfully threw out those words, but no response came back.Maybe she was quite exhausted, stumbling down the path coming here.The rain stopped and the clouds began to clear as the rising moonlight cast a shadow. It ended up making it even harder to decipher the girl\u2019s expression.And then she pulled out a sharp, silver dagger from under her arm.Goosebumps rose all over my body.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dDid she pick up one of the daggers that Shaney was using? If she had come out through the back gate after I defeated Shaney, she would have been able to obtain one.The use of magic power was too conspicuous, so maybe she was going to just keep a dagger as a means of self defense?I shook my head.\u2018Pull yourself together. That\u2019s just a very hopeful interpretation.\u2019I tried to step back, but I couldn\u2019t take another due to my injuries.Yeah, did I get a little too complacent?She was the Golden Daughter, Lortel.She was someone who was cruel and ungrateful. Someone who took advantage of people as much as she could before throwing them away.Right. From Lortel\u2019s point of view\u2026 Now was the time to get rid of Ed Rothstaylor.Regardless of what ended up happening to Elte, those who knew the truth about the relation between the Elte Company and the occupation of Ophelis Hall had to be reduced to the smallest number possible.There were five people that she had brought in.Elris, Shaney, Kelly, Willain\u2026 And me, Ed Rothstaylor.Even if she ended up overthrowing Elte, she still needed to keep the mouths of those five people shut.Elris was a person that moved according to the logic of money. Even though she may not be able to open up her heart to her again, as she has already been betrayed by her once, she could be confident that she could shut her up with enough money. The reason she had betrayed her in the first place was probably because of the amount of money.And not just that. If Elte were to lose his position, Elris would have no choice but to fall into Lortel\u2019s hand. As long as she could clearly see the circumstances, then she could use her to her heart's content.Shaney and Kelly were maids who were loyal to Elris. As long as she could persuade Elris, then those two would keep their mouths shut as well.Willain, the representative of the lower students, was brought into the plan with money from the beginning. He always wanted to be the voice of the lower students, but whenever he was given money he was easily swayed and taken advantage of.And the last variable was Ed Rothstaylor, who was out of her control.At first she thought that he could be bought with money, but now she was unsure if buying him over with just money was possible.She had to take into account the risk of being stabbed in the back, while trying to forcefully figure out his inner thoughts and plans.A remote part of the northern forest.Nobody would notice amidst the chaos of the Ophelis Hall incident.The opponent\u2019s whole body was a wreck. He was in a state of total exhaustion, with an injury that made him unable to even properly hold his body up.There was a sharp weapon in her hand.She was a girl who was like the incarnation of greed, who unconditionally seized even the smallest opportunities.I knew better than anyone else that she wasn\u2019t a person who would give up an opportunity like this.Let\u2019s calm down.I could overcome the situation.She was as tired as I was, and we weren't so deep in the woods that it would be impossible to make it to the Teacher District if I ran away immediately.In addition, there are also quite a few spirits in the forest that were favorable to me. With their help, we could interfere with Lortel\u2019s movement for a while.Well, I needed to admit what was obvious. I had gotten a bit complacent.I couldn\u2019t take into account the situation because I was busy dealing with so many sudden variables.Even despite that, I should have never forgotten the nature behind the character \u2018Lortel Kehelland\u2019.Act 2, Chapter 10: The battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal. It took place after Act 2, Chapter 3: The Occupation of Ophelis Hall.Did I already forget about Lortel\u2019s role in the climax?Lortel Kehelland was an evil girl who would take advantage of anyone, regardless of who they were, and immediately throw them away afterwards.Someone who stabbed her own adoptive father in the back, took advantage of Taylee and his party by knowing their every move, and then ran away with all the benefits by herself in the end.I still remember the scene where she mockingly smiled in front of the school, holding onto the Sage\u2019s Seal. When she smiled, head down, as she listened to Elte\u2019s screams. Those scenes were still stuck in my mind.This was not the time for me to be acting like this. I need to use my brain.The moment I tried to straighten my body and come up with a decent escape plan\u2026Rrrrrrrrip.Lortel used the dagger to tear a hole into her expensive-looking robe.She then stumbled forward, walking towards me.\u201cYou ended up getting hurt\u2026 to this extent\u2026\u201dWith the torn fabric\u2026 she tied it around my wound.I could see her expression now that she was closer\u2026 It looked like she was going to cry.\u201cI\u2019ll help you. I lit the campfire, since it stopped raining. First, we should warm up.\u201d***Crackle, Crackle.\u201cSo, did everything go as planned?\u201d\u201cEd, you're really quite\u2026 Of course it did. I\u2019m Lortel Kehelland.\u201dThe moon and stars came out like usual. The sky after the rain had stopped. It felt rather cozy.She grinned, holding onto a mug next to the burning campfire. She had finally returned to her foxlike appearance.\u201cI got a promise from the coachman. He said that he would try his best to attract their attention and buy some time. He\u2019s even willing to risk his life.\u201d\u201cHe was that loyal? What type of trick did you use?\u201d\u201cYou want to know?\u201dJust by looking at her wide smile, I could tell that it wasn\u2019t a very honorable method. I refrained from asking any further questions. Don\u2019t tell me, she wouldn\u2019t have taken their family hostage, right?\u2026 Right?\u201cWell, it was a lot different than I had planned, but\u2026 Anyway, I am in great debt to you, Ed. Thank you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cDid you know? If this plan goes well, then I'll join the ranks of those highest in power within the Elte Company.\u201dThe position of head would be taken by another senior merchant, but since she was the one who actually created an empty seat for the new head, she would become an influential figure within the business.\u201cThe fact that I owe you a debt, isn\u2019t it something incredible? What do you think? Don\u2019t you feel a lot of pressure on your shoulders? Don\u2019t you think I'm amazing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, that reaction was so lame.\u201dI felt relieved to see that her sparkling smile while saying those words was no different from her usual smile, the one that hid her evil intentions.While laughing so mischievously, she took a sip of the herbal tea from the mug\u2026 and quietly lowered her voice.\u201cThank you so much. I will never forget it.\u201d\u201cGive me the twenty gold coins you promised me on time, then.\u201d\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s\u2026 of course I will.\u201dShe never got rid of her smile, as if everything was great. Blinking and staring straight at my face, I felt uncomfortable\u2014as if she was trying to see what was hidden in my heart.\u201cThat\u2019s that. But there\u2019s something I wanted to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you still have something to take care of? Is it about Elris?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing like that. I\u2019m going to take care of that stuff on my own\u2026 What I wanted to ask about was Yennekar.\u201dIt was a natural technique for merchants to change a topic naturally like the wind.\u201cEd, you\u2019re very close to Yennekar. Right?\u201dI tilted my head at that question and answer immediately.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m close with Yennekar. She\u2019s a good person.\u201d\u201cShe is definitely a nice, and great upperclassman that I respect. She\u2019s always considerate of others and good hearted.\u201d\u201cYeah. So, what's up?\u201dSaying that, Lortel looked down at the herbal tea and then looked up at the sky. The sky from the river in the northern forest was as high and clear as usual.\u201cI\u2019m not that nice of a person.\u201dShe recited those words while quietly holding onto the mug gently closing her eyes.***Booooooom!The first floor of Ophelis Hall was no longer only partially destroyed. It was now completely destroyed.Ziggs Eiffelstein finished the battle and straightened his body. The mercenaries brought by Elte were less impressive than he had expected.They didn\u2019t look like mercenaries under direct control of the Elte Company. Though even at that level of quality, if there were too many then it could have become hard for Ziggs. Quality was important, but quantity could always make up for it.However, the mercenaries\u2019 training was so poor that Ziggs and Yennekar alone were enough to defend Ophelis Hall.\u2018Were they just mercenaries who were brought over in a hurry? It must have been quite the urgent situation, or perhaps a situation in which he didn\u2019t want anyone to know that he had left his seat?\u2019Coming up with such a guess, Ziggs sat down on the rubble near him.\u2018For some reason\u2026 I have a feeling that we are going to have another fight. I\u2019m a little worried about the head maid, as well. It seems like there is something weird going on.\u2019He didn\u2019t feel completely relieved, but that couldn\u2019t be helped given that the situation had become like this.\u201cPhew. Good work, Yennekar.\u201dEd suddenly requested help and, without fully understanding the situation, he ended up helping. Though, somehow everything ended well.Elte suddenly received a report from his subordinate in the middle of it all, and rushed out. It seemed that he was no longer interested in Ophelis Hall.Was this all according to Ed\u2019s plan? He hoped that he could at least hear a detailed explanation of the situation from him later.With that in mind, Ziggs looked towards Yennekar.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAmong the mid-ranking spirits there was a girl. At first, she looked a bit worried. But as the battle continued, the spirits grew stronger and stronger\u2014to an unbelievable strength.Since he was afraid of casualties, he had to keep an eye on Yennekar.\u201cYennekar?\u201dFrom Ziggs\u2019 point of view, he could only see Yennekar\u2019s back. Looking at her, it was like he had seen a ghost. Chills ran across his body. Ziggs took a moment to take a deep breath.\u201c\u2026 Yennekar, is something the matter? By chance, are you angry?\u201dThe girl was smiling gently.\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201dHowever, because of her protruding veins, Ziggs felt uncomfortable talking to her.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Cat, Cat, Cat (1)Clara, A 2nd year magic student and one of Yennekar\u2019s best friends, had been standing outside the half destroyed Ophelis Hall since morning. That was because there was someone that she wanted to meet with.\u201cHello, Ms. Bell.\u201dA day has passed since the major destruction caused by the occupation of Ophelis Hall had come to an end. Although the detailed investigation had yet to be completed, amongst the students there were rumors that the maids were somehow involved with the incident.Clara had felt that the rumors were nothing more than that: mere rumors. The school\u2019s inspection department would eventually come to a conclusion after discovering more details.\u201cGasp.\u201dThe reconstruction site of the half destroyed Ophelis Hall.Since it had barely been two days since the incident, no sort of significant reconstruction work had been started. The faculty and maids were busy trying to figure out the extent of the damage.At the entrance of the rose garden, she ran into Bell Maya. She was busy taking notes. Clara let out a gasp.Bell Maya, unlike usual, was wearing a dark red maid outfit covered in beautiful decorations. Looking at the blue rose brooch on her chest, the blue frills that came down the hem of her skirt, it was definitely the outfit that only the head maid was permitted to wear.\u201cAren\u2019t you a close friend of Lady Yennekar? What brings you all the way to Ophelis Hall?\u201d\u201cOh! Hello, Ms. Bell. Did you recently get promoted?\u201d\u201cDue to Ms. Elris' personal circumstances, she was no longer able to fulfill her duty as the head maid. As such, I have been promoted from a Senior Maid to the Head Maid.\u201cI\u2026 I see. It somehow feels like your position is much higher\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no reason to feel uncomfortable. Our main duty is to help others. If you need anything, please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I wanted to talk to you about a personal matter\u2026 How should I say this? Nevermind, you look quite busy right now.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 I am a bit busy, but\u2026\u201dBell looked down at her checklist, then glanced back at the half destroyed Ophelis Hall before shaking her head.\u201cMost of the work has already been done, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to give out any further orders. I was going to take a break anyway.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d\u201cSo, what was it that you wanted to talk about?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too surprised. This is top secret. You can never leak this out, and you\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0act too surprised.\u201dClara\u2019s face stiffened as she leaned in towards Bell with a serious tone to her voice.Bell wondered just what kind of shocking secret she was about to tell her as she paid close attention.\u201cIt\u2019s about Yennekar\u2026 I think she likes Ed\u2026 Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dHaving already known that fact to a surprising degree, she wondered if she should at least pretend to be surprised.\u201cI just don\u2019t get why someone like Yennekar would fall so madly in love with that\u00a0thug\u2026 And as her friend, my feelings are mixed.\u201dThey had moved over to a bench in the rose garden. Clara, who kept on looking around nearby to make sure that nobody was passing by, soon confessed all of the troubles buried deep in her heart to Bell.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for three days and nights already, but\u2026 These days, Ed\u2019s reputation has improved a bit. I\u2019m sure Yennekar also has something on her mind, so I came to the decision to cheer them on. But I still feel very, very uncertain about it all.\u201dAs she listened to every word Clara lamented, Bell thought that Yennekar had truly made a great friend. That was because in this world, there are very few people who would truly care for their friend\u2019s relationships to that extentEven though she could have easily ended up interfering in something that was none of her business, Clara made sure to not cross that line and only worried about Yennekar\u2019s love life.\u201cFirst off, if Yennekar really thinks of him like that\u2026 Then as her friend, I really do hope that Yennekar and Ed work out well.\u201d\u201cI see. You must have been very worried about her, Lady Clara.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 that\u2019s not the point!\u201dBell tilted her head. Right as she was going to respond, Clara interrupted, spitting out another girl's name.\u201cLortel Kehelland! You know that name, right? You must, because you were a senior maid at Ophelis Hall!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, of course I know of her.\u201d\u201cRecently, Yennekar has been saying her name quite often. Even though she\u2019s a 1st year, ever since the joint combat practice she has been involved with them quite a bit. Though, it doesn\u2019t seem like anything is happening.\u201dClara looked around nearby once more, before quietly lowering her voice and whispering to Bell.\u201cSo I looked into it personally, and I\u2019m not sure, but they were both absent on the day of the opening ceremony. They were also together yesterday, during their shared first period. Thinking about Yennekar\u2026 it seems that she\u2019s in quite a pickle.\u201dFor a girl, the existence of a rival was like a disaster\u2026 At first she thought that she may have just had a simple misunderstanding.\u201cMs. Bell, I\u2019ve heard a lot about you from Yennekar. She said that she relied on you quite a bit and you always gave her helpful advice\u2026 I heard that you are quite an insightful person.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re flattering me.\u201d\u201cAnd you also know both Yennekar and Lortel quite well\u2026 so I came here because I wanted to ask for your opinion.\u201d\u201cLady Lortel is quite a famous person. I\u2019m sure that you also know of her, don\u2019t you?\u201dRumors about the Golden Daughter Lortel were spreading throughout the school, regardless of the grade.\u201cI know of her. But seeing just a bit of her\u2026 I just can\u2019t see Yennekar winning\u2026\u201d\u201cI think that Lady Yennekar is a person that is also plenty attractive.\u201d\u201cOf course I also think that, too. But Lortel is like\u2026\u201dClara\u2019s words didn\u2019t come out, but Bell nodded her head.Indeed, Lortel Kehelland is definitely a foxlike girl. She is always well behaved and her actions were full of grace. But when an opportunity struck, she was like a little devil that couldn\u2019t hide her true, dark feelings. Clara knew that quite well.Her life as a merchant didn\u2019t go to waste, so surely she had a better understanding of how to develop relationships and gain the interest of others.\u201cI don\u2019t have much relationship experience, but\u2026 Ultimately, relationships between men and women are a game of push and pull\u2026\u201dBell had no choice but to nod her head at Clara\u2019s complaining.Yennekar Palerover was innocent and positive by nature, so she only knew how to pull and not push.Lortel, on the other hand\u2026 Being a merchant, there was no way that she wouldn\u2019t be completely capable of controlling the speed of a relationship's growth.No matter how attractive and loveable Yennekar might be, in front of Lortel\u2019s skilled tug-of-war she couldn\u2019t do anything\u2026 She was like a fish on a line.Clara clenched her fist.\u201cThat can\u2019t happen! That\u2019s why\u2026 I think Yennekar should learn how to play hard to get!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter what, I really want Yennekar to learn how to do that. It\u2019ll be too painful for her to lose a relationship because of adult charm from a girl a year younger than her. At least she will have gone through a learning experience if she gets rejected by that awful guy instead\u2026 but to be robbed of a relationship will only hurt!\u201dBell wanted to applaud Clara, who was passionately expressing her frustration, but she refrained from reacting. To cry to such an extent, worrying about a friend's life.\u201cWhat do you think, Ms. Bell? I heard that you always say the right thing!\u201dThose burning eyes of hers turned towards Bell. Honestly. It was a bit awkward.\u201cWh-Who can say? I\u2019m really not quite sure\u2026\u201dIn any case, Bell was already acquainted with Ed, Yennekar, and Lortel. Compared to Clara, who is somewhat biased, she could judge the situation a bit more objectively.\u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think that there is a reason for Lady Yennekar to have to say something that doesn\u2019t suit her.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You think so?\u201d\u201cAnd your thoughts could be perceived as a bit biased as well, right? I think that it\u2019s possible that Lady Yennekar is quite a bit more capable than you think, and Lady Lortel could also be less experienced in human relationships than expected, as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not sure\u2026 It\u2019s hard to agree with that part\u2026\u201dAnyway, it wasn\u2019t a good idea to unnecessarily meddle in other people's love affairs. That was the conclusion Bell had come to, so she had no intention of supporting the extremely worried Clara\u2019s objective.\u201cIn the first place, I don\u2019t even know much about Ed Rothstaylor! Is he just a ridiculously stubborn person, or was he just born an unpleasant jerk?!\u201dIn the end, Clara\u2019s hostility all ended up being directed towards Ed Rothstaylor.\u201cIn fact, it's kind of ridiculous that she keeps looking at him like that, but he doesn\u2019t even realize it!\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, for young master Ed\u2019s case\u2026 Rather than being a stubborn person or a complete jerk\u2026 I think it\u2019s just because he\u2019s in a situation where it's difficult to have an interest in a relationship\u2026\u201dEd Rothstaylor was someone who had set up a camp in the northern forest, taking care of food, shelter, and clothing all by himself.Sometimes Bell would come by to give him some food ingredients, herbs and other medical supplies, but\u2026 Ed had been taking care of the bare fundamentals of survival entirely on his own.In addition to that, he was also studying the academy\u2019s curriculum. He was living a life where he had to strategically divide each hour of the day into a task.He was in a spot where getting distracted by a woman for even a few days risked him running out of food. It was already almost autumn, with winter quickly approaching. There would be a lot of other concerns that he will need to prepare for, as well.\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible. Well, he was just born lucky. Having good luck when it comes to girls\u2026 I\u2019m sure that he has his mouth open like a creep, drunk on his own popularity. I\u2019m getting the chills just thinking about it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBell didn\u2019t respond as she clenched her fist, leaving Clara to continue with her story. Well, sometimes it was enough of a relief to just vent to someone else about your issues and worries.Bell closed her eyes as she thought about Ed\u2019s situation. Right now, it looked like he was struggling to survive. Would it really be a situation for him to be enjoying his luck when it came to girls? Considering all of that, she gave him a silent prayer.Ultimately, when she thought about all the girls around that boy, she could only think of them as cats and other animals.Lortel Kehelland was like a feisty stray cat, sitting in front of a fish shop.Yennekar Palerover was like an innocent kitten, trembling in fear in front of a tiger.Lucy\u2026 well she was just a cat.Either way, she could clearly see Ed struggling amongst all of those girls as she tried to give him some encouragement that would never reach him.It seemed that she needed to take some time to go and visit Ed\u2019s camp.She wanted to check it out, seeing that Clara was worried to such an extent, but\u2026 there was also a message she needed to deliver from Head Maid Elris.Though, it was not good news.* * *It had been a while since the weather was so good. I went over to the stream next to the camp to wash my face and decided to check my Life Skills.[Life Skills Details]Grade: Intermediate CraftsmenSpecialized Fields: WoodworkingHandicraft Lvl 13Design Lvl 8Collecting Skills Lvl 11Woodworking Lv 12Hunting Lv 8Fishing Lv 6Cooking Lv 6Repairing Lv 5<Advanced Production Technique Slot: Empty><Advanced Production Technique Slot: Empty>Since the advanced production technique slots were currently empty, acquiring a new technique that I could use was of the highest priority.I\u2019d already decided on what skills I was going to learn.I planned to start learning Spiritual Infusion\u2014which has a good compatibility with Elementalists\u2014as well as Magic Engineering, which would be great for making daily necessities and other types of combat-related equipment.Spiritual Infusion was acquired automatically once you made a contract with a spirit and produced a product that contained Elementalism. Magic Engineering, on the other hand, was acquired once you succeed in dismantling and assembling a magically engineered item of a certain level.Compared to Combat-type skills and Magic-type skills, the methods to acquire them were quite simple and quick. That was the benefit of Production-type skills.I didn\u2019t want to waste a spirit slot unnecessarily, but if I wanted to start training Spiritual Infusion in advance, it would be better to just make a contract with a low-ranking spirit immediately.In that case, I thought it would be better for me to make it with a spirit who was of an attribute different than mine. Earth or water spirits.If I start dealing with spirits properly, then I\u2019d start to increase my spirit-type skills\u2019 proficiency quickly. Then, once my magic-type stats were able to support me, the day that I could make a contract with a high-ranking spirit would come sooner than expected.In that regard, it might have been better to go and get some help from Yennekar.My body condition wasn\u2019t great. I couldn\u2019t push my body too far doing things that required a lot of work. In other words, because of the Occupation of Ophelis Hall incident, I ended up pushing myself too far. Because of that,when it came down to labor intensive work, I couldn\u2019t do much of it.Well, what can you do\u2026? It was a necessary sacrifice.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *In any case, I was able to prevent Lortel, one of the main characters of the story line, from leaving. The plan seemed to have worked to some extent, given that there had been no significant response from Elte yet.The rest needed to be fought out back at Elte\u2019s headquarters, so the only thing we could do was wait for the situation to play itself out and wait for good news from the homing pigeon, which would eventually fly back.\u201cHi, Ed! Now that the rain has stopped, the weather has gotten a bit chilly!\u201d\u201cOh. Hey, Yennekar.\u201dYennekar still visited the camp every day. It was great, as she would bring all sorts of food ingredients with her.\u201cIs Lortel doing okay?\u201d\u201cYeah. She\u2019s just resting in the cabin.\u201dI told Yennekar the entire story.After explaining Lortel\u2019s situation to her and how she had to be in hiding for a while, Yennekar had nodded her head and accepted that fact. After that, she started coming over to see if she was okay every single day.However, it was already the start of school and the second semester\u2019s curriculum was already underway.Lortel had no intention of going to class until her safety was ensured, and since my uniform was a wreck, I ended up borrowing Ziggs\u2019. However, I needed to adjust it to fit me. It would be really difficult to attend class until I was able to finish fixing it.So Lortel and I weren\u2019t able to go to class until our situation got better. Yennekar, on the other hand, had no such reason. And yet, she still came by the camp every day to sit down and read her magic textbooks.\u201cYennekar, you\u2019re not going to class?\u201d\u201cHm? My head hurts and my condition isn\u2019t all that great, so I\u2019m just going to rest here in the northern forest and enjoy the breeze. I already told the professors, and they just told me to take care of myself.\u201d\u201cReally? You didn\u2019t get hurt while trying to help me, right?\u201d\u201cNo way. Definitely not. You should just do what you need to do. I\u2019m just going to sit here enjoying nature, then head back when it\u2019s time.\u201dEven though Yenenkar said that, she didn\u2019t seem to be in any sort of pain.She sat down on a wooden stool by the campfire the entire day, reading her book. She would also sometimes glare at the cabin, almost like she was surveying it.It seems that Yennekar didn\u2019t fully trust Lortel quite yet. That was understandable. After all, Lortel's past was something quite special.***\u201cI see, Ed. Well, it\u2019s a shame that you can\u2019t explain the details of the situation to me\u2026 But at least I was able to pay off my debt.\u201dAs the sun went down, I was off chopping firewood when Ziggs came by to ask about the situation from the previous night and help me out. I gave him a brief explanation of the story, and answered the questions he asked me.\u201cWell, it seems that they can\u2019t really tell that we destroyed part of Ophelis Hall. The building was already half-destroyed in the first place, so it wasn\u2019t obvious that we destroyed part of it.\u201d\u201cWhat about the disciplinary actions against the students?\u201d\u201cMost of it was put on that upperclassmen, Willain, as well as some other students who were dealt a minor punishment. The head maid is still being interrogated, but it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s opening her mouth.\u201dSeeing as there was no mention of Lortel, Elris must have been staying silent. She couldn\u2019t hastily confess without knowing if Lortel or Elte was going to win.Once it was safe, she would probably try and secretly make contact as fast as possible.\u201cAlright. Anyway, this time I owe you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Next time as well, make sure to let me know if you need anything. I\u2019ll be heading out now.\u201dZiggs waved at me as he left. I dropped the axe I was holding next to me and let out a deep sigh.It was probably better that Lortel stayed hidden in the cabin.I could just keep on sharing food with her, and once some time passed and we heard news of our victory, we could both return back to our normal lives.I hoped there wouldn\u2019t be any major accidents before then.I sat down in the middle of the forest to take a break, smelling the breeze of the upcoming fall, hoping for a peaceful time.Most of my wounds had healed, so they weren\u2019t bothering me too much anymore.* * *The quiet atmosphere inside the cabin calmed her down.Lortel sat, leaning against the rough wall, quietly waiting for time to pass by.Although the Occupation of Ophelis Hall Incident had come to an end, there was still a lot of work left for her to do.The first thing was to win over the former maid Elris again.The rumors going around said that the head maid Elris was keeping her mouth shut in front of the investigators. As she couldn't tell who the winner would be between Lortel and Elte, she was going to stay quiet until she knew for sure.The second thing was to lay the groundwork for the negotiations on the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal.Elte losing his position had ended up happening earlier than expected, but since there was still an opportunity to purchase the Sage\u2019s Seal, she couldn\u2019t waste it. Once the plan was established, Lortel\u2019s position in the Elte Company would be one of the most influential. Even the head wouldn\u2019t be able to touch her easily.Even though she was quite busy, she couldn\u2019t do anything about it unless she could quickly fly over to the headquarters. Though, by living in the northern forest she first had to make sure that she was completely safe before she could head back to take classes as a student of Silvenia.She should have been a bit frustrated at having to quit her life as a merchant and stay in the cabin for the next three days or so, despite being so busy. However, her heart was warm knowing that Ed came to check on her often, making sure she wasn\u2019t inconvenienced in any way.It wasn\u2019t all that bad, considering the fact she had lived a splendid life full of luxury before suddenly moving into a cabin in the wilds\u2026 Though, she was sure that it was all thanks to that boy she was with.Her heart would beat fast sitting down next to Ed Rothstaylor.His unconditional goodwill and unrequited trust made her feel like she was snuggled in a fluffy bed.For some that was only natural, but for Lortel\u2014who had lived her entire life on a cold distant path\u2014that feeling was more precious than gold.It went without saying, but she didn\u2019t want to give him up to anyone else.Especially\u00a0that\u00a0person. Yennekar Palerover.A girl who had lived her life like a protagonist in a fairytale. To her, a relationship with unconditional goodwill and trust must have been oh so natural and common.Whether it was her friends or family, they would all support her. To Lortel, though, that man was a luxury. A heartwarming relationship, where she knew that he would never betray her. For Yennekar, he was no more common than a pebble on a street.If she had that many, she should at least give up this one.Lortel had thought she was too cruel, and couldn\u2019t understand her at all.Being like that, the only thing left was to fight dirty. Unfortunately for Yennekar, that was Lortel\u2019s specialty.Not just that, but spending three days with him was such a massive and perfect advantage for her.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHowever, how would their relationship as a man and woman progress?She had taken the initiative in human relationships countless times before, but she didn't know if it would work the same way in a more affectionate relationship between man and woman.That was right. She had been living her life thus far in a brutal business world, where she had to weigh humans by interests alone. That was why she didn\u2019t have any knowledge about how a romantic relationship between a man and woman developed.\u2018Unexpectedly, this is something I suck at\u2026\u2019 Lortel thought, as she tried to view herself objectively. It was unlike her usual self.\u201cLet\u2019s just do it my way.\u201dShe kept on saying those words to herself as she decided to do things her own way.After all, the easiest way to gain someone\u2019s favor was with money.If she buried his shabby cabin with gold coins, then wouldn\u2019t he look at her with sparkling eyes anyways?\u201cBut I'm short on money\u2026\u201dEven so, she was still in the middle of reaching out to various businesses. It would affect Lortel\u2019s personal assets as well. Still, selling a villa in the Mine Region or a certificate of land on the outskirts would have a similar performance.However, when she imagined Ed Rothstaylor\u2019s eyes full of childish greed, she shook her head.In the end, since it would be a relationship formed out of money, there wouldn\u2019t be any sense of affection. Thinking of seeing him look at her with such eyes, smiling only for his own greed, broke her heart.But even then, it wasn\u2019t right to sit around and do nothing.Just by watching Ed throughout the day, she could tell that he was living a hellish life. Without wasting a single minute, or even a single second, he clenched his teeth and struggled to survive.Before her selfish desire to be favored and loved\u2026 She also felt a sense of affection, a desire to help him.But on the other hand, she was worried that it might be looked at as pity, and thus would eventually lead to a relationship made out of money\u2026 Lortel sat down, cross legged, as she scrunched her toes.\u201cHa\u2026\u2026 Isn\u2019t it okay to help with his tuition?\u201dIf she gave him that much money, that wouldn\u2019t be too much like pity, right?Being a girl who had never given a favor without a cost in the first place, she couldn\u2019t even imagine what she should say or how to give him the money. Some examples of the lines she came up with while thinking on it were\u2026\u2018D-Don\u2019t get the wrong idea. I-I\u2019m not just giving this to you because you\u2019re my upperclassmen.\u2019Lortel cringed as she curled her hands and kicked the wall of the hut. She was embarrassed by those lines, but for some reason they felt very natural to her.Didn\u2019t she live a life hidden under a mask, with a foxlike smile hiding her dark inner intentions and ideals? Now, even in such a ridiculous situation, she couldn\u2019t take off that mask and show her face.Taking a deep breath, she regained her composure. She straightened out the thoughts in her head as she thought about how to get through to him in a seductive, desirable manner.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the first place, if you wanted to watch how and where a relationship between a man and woman crossed the line, it was just a matter of waiting and observing.Anyway, at that moment Ed didn\u2019t see Lortel as a woman in the slightest. The development of a relationship would eventually stem from a change of perception. The first course of action would be to change his perception of her.Lortel thought up that \u2018plan\u2019 in her mind as she nodded her head, as if she had decided on what to do.It was impossible to realize at that point just how ridiculous that \u2018plan\u2019 was.As said before, Lortel was good when it came down to controlling or shaking up someone's mind. But when it came to simple and affectionate relationships, which she was awful in, even Yennekar was years ahead of her.\u201cThen\u2026 Specifically, I will need to\u2026\u201dHowever, it would take time to come up with a specified plan of action. For the next three days she would be hiding out in the cabin, so she had plenty of time to think it over.She thought that, as long as she planned it out carefully, she would be able to beat Yennekar in no time at all.With a sly smile, Lortel hugged her knees.***\u201c\u2026Can you move over? You\u2019re in my spot.\u201dHowever, there was an unexpected event. A new girl had arrived.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201d\u201cYawn\u2026\u201dShe was familiar with that large witch\u2019s hat, the school uniform with long sleeves, pigtails that easily came down past her waist to her butt. Someone that she would often meet in Professor Glast\u2019s class, and one of the three students in Class A.Just when did she enter the cabin? When did she come in from the roof? And when did she learn spatial-type magic? The girl whose movements were impossible to predict, and who would always make the people around her bewildered\u2026\u201c\u2026Lucy\u2026? What are you doing here\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis is the best place. It\u2019s where the sun shines down the best.\u201dShe then pushed Lortel away as she threw some Marten skin down on the floor, pressed on it hard, and then laid down on top of it\u2026 She then fell asleep peacefully, arms wrapped around herself.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn a moment of complete confusion, Lortel wiped her face.\u201c\u2026 Just what\u2019s with this girl\u2026?\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Cat, Cat, Cat (2)Even for someone like Lortel, who grew up meeting all sorts of people, Lucy Mayreel was a girl that was nearly impossible to understand.Walking through the school grounds, you would sometimes catch her peacefully sleeping in a nice and sunny spot. She was someone that you would consider an oddball as you walked past her.However, she was also someone that had once been seen destroying a high-ranking spirit at the top of a mountain on the northwest side of the island. There was also the time that she got rid of a bunch of monsters that resembled sharks with a single motion of her hand\u2026Lortel had often heard stories of people seeing her around, wielding an immense amount of transcendental strength.But during the Glasskan or Ophelis Hall incident, she could be found sleeping in a corner\u2014not even thinking of helping out with her powers. There was a limit to how ridiculous a person could be, even if they were the type that lived at their own pace.In the first place, Lortel\u2019s resources didn\u2019t have a single bit of information about Lucy Mayreel\u2019s identity or life.She couldn\u2019t even take a guess as to where she came from or what she did before entering Silvenia.In addition to that, it didn\u2019t make any sense as to why she would be attending the academy when she already had the strength to destroy an entire city.She regularly attended classes, but most of the time she was dozing off. Even then, the professor in charge\u2014Glast\u2014would never lay a finger on Lucy.In the first place, there wasn\u2019t a sign that he was trying to teach Lucy anything. One time Ziggs, who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, actually went up to complain to Professor Glast about her behavior.\u201cThat student is not at a level where it would matter if I taught her or not. You shouldn\u2019t worry about her. She\u2019s the type that, once there\u2019s something she needs to achieve, she will realize it and grow by herself.\u201dShe was a student at the level that even a professor, whose entire job was to guide and nurture students, would say such a thing. In the end, Ziggs and Lortel had no choice but to leave Lucy to her eccentric ways.Although the situation bothered her a little, Lucy didn\u2019t really bother Lortel. Actually, they had never even talked before in the first place.Always walking around school with a blank expression, eating when she was hungry, and sleeping when she was tired\u2026 Wasn\u2019t she just like a stray cat?Before, Lortel had wished that Lucy could become a personal connection to her so that she could make use of her transcendental strength. However, the more she saw her, the more she gave up on her hopes of being able to use her.Thinking of things like that, she had become quite adjusted to Lucy.\u201cMughaaaaak!\u201dHumph.Ed lifted up Lucy on his shoulder as he carried her to the wooden shelter outside. He then opened up the door again and entered the building.\u201cOh. Sorry. You woke up, Lortel. I guess Lucy came to hide out in the cabin. I got rid of her already, so you can just relax like it\u2019s your own home.\u201dEd wiped off his sweat, as if he had just finished all the cleaning that had been delayed.The Second Morning of Lortel\u2019s Life in the Cabin.The first day went insanely quick.For the first time in her life, she washed herself out in a stream. Since her clothes were drying, she wore extremely worn-out clothes as she sat awkwardly in the corner of the cabin. Ed minded his own business as he cooked up some fish and gave it to her. Eating it, she felt a strange sense of warmth and comfort.Looking up at the starry sky, she started to soak in the romantic atmosphere\u2026 There were all sorts of exciting and heart-racing experiences that had happened to her, so many that it was hard to summarize in just one sentence.As someone being chased, it was fun to finally go outside. Since she had spent most of her time stuck inside the cabin, just sitting outside in the camp gave her a strange sense of satisfaction\u2026 Even though the wooden floor was hard and tough, she was able to get a good night\u2019s sleep on it.However, calling her life hiding out in the camp a romantic healing experience\u2026 it was a bit difficult to call it that. Being on the run from someone had also played a role in it, but the most inconvenient thing for her was her natural enemy.\u201cI heard that Yennekar stopped by this morning. I guess she came over to read some books at the campfire, then do some spiritual training. If you need anything, you can also just let her know.\u201dThe night before, Yennekar had stayed as late as possible\u2014until curfew, when she had to return to Dex Hall.She returned to the northern forest early in the morning. She seemed to be spending all her time there, over the full three days that Lortel was there, sitting at the camp.Occasionally, when they would make eye contact outside the door, Yennekar would smile with the brightest, most positive expression in the world. Not falling far behind, Lortel would respond with her own bright, energetic smile. It felt like they were getting tired of dealing with each other.Anyways, over the three days that she had given up her life of being a merchant, the only enemy for Lortel was Yennekar.\u2026At least, that\u2019s what she thought.\u201cLucy seems to come by the camp often?\u201d\u201cTell me about it. I just think of her as a natural disaster.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLortel felt her unique gut feeling starting to growl.Thinking about the fact that she saw Lucy both that day and the day before, she wondered if she was spending too much time at the camp.Whenever she had the chance, she would sit next to Ed\u2019s side, pick up some jerky on the drying rack, sleep somewhere like the roof of the cabin, or go over to the rocks that were near Ed while he chopped firewood to tell him random stories.In the first place, there was no reason to have any suspicions about Lucy, due to her nature. However, that was only with the way things were currently.Even Ed began to think of her visiting the camp as a natural thing, like a part of the scenery. Whenever she came to her senses, she was always sitting next to him. Wasn\u2019t that pretty dangerous?As said before, the opportunity for a relationship between a man and women to progress came from a change in perception. If Lucy were to change her behavior and feel some sense of love or desire towards Ed\u2026 There would be another disaster, one other than Yennekar. Actually, it could be even more troublesome.It was one of the many lessons she learned while living in the world of business. If you found the seed of a disaster, it was best to remove it immediately.However, the way of doing so was troubling. If someone were to ask \u2018How?\u2019, she couldn\u2019t help but respond with a vague answer.\u201cIt may get a bit noisy, but I\u2019m very busy, so please try to understand.\u201dEd brought over a pile of bricks that came out of seemingly nowhere and began to pile them up.Lortel nodded her head timidly as she glared at the wooden shelter, barely able to see through the crack of the open door.Wearing clothes that were completely messy and not straightened, Lucy\u2014who was laying down stuffing her mouth full of jerky\u2014had fallen asleep\u2026 Her appearance definitely suggested that she had no interest at all when it came to love, or the desire to keep Ed to herself.In the first place, it was clear that she had built up some sort of wall for those emotions\u2026 Lortel started to wonder if she had just overreacted.Anyway, Lucy was hard to understand from a normal person\u2019s perspective, due to her unpredictable actions.There was no harm in being too careful, but there was also no need to overreact and tire herself out for no reason.The relationship between Ed and Lucy was a matter between those two, and not for someone like Lortel to intervene in. Even though they weren\u2019t in a romantic relationship yet, trying to restrain her partner\u2019s actions seemed like a tiring move to make.After some degree of self-reflection, Lortel nodded her head as she leaned back against the wall of the cabin.She wondered if she had become unnecessarily sensitive to those unfamiliar feelings. Slowly, she started to enjoy her appearance, which was now quite different from the norm.She held her knees as she placed her chin on them, playing with her hair and taking secret glances at Ed\u2019s back as he carried the bricks.She couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh like an idiot, though she didn\u2019t want to ruin her image of being an experienced and merciless merchant by showing off that side of herself. She ducked her head.Right then, Lortel\u2019s mask was her most powerful weapon.Either way, she currently believed that she didn\u2019t need to be too sensitive about Ed\u2019s other relationships.She had more than enough time left.* * *[Newly Finished Product]Handmade BrickA brick formed by pouring mud into a mold to keep its shape.After it is thoroughly dried, Ignite magic is applied to burn it into a brick.Production Difficulty Level: \u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u300a Production completed.

I had no choice but to make use of the afternoon or work late into the night to do it.Still, I was satisfied with the level of the finished product itself, which was a great feeling that I hadn\u2019t felt in a while. Just a bit more, and it wouldn\u2019t be long until the day I could move into the cabin fully.I had a safe environment to live in. What a dream-like thing to say.\u201cOh my. The smell is quite unique. Did you add basil?\u201d\u201cBell gave me some last time. You could figure it out just by smelling it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite confident in my sense of smell.\u201dLortel, who was humming a song. Yennekar, who was glaring at her. And finally, me. The three of us gathered around the fire as I finished preparing lunch.It was a dish made from raw fish, cut into filets and then grilled on a grate with various spices as seasoning.As my cooking skill proficiency increased as time passed, as well as the fact that I was in an environment where I could gather and use a variety of ingredients, it felt like the types of food I could eat had risen quite a bit.Well, it was still all food that came from the wild\u2026 But anyway, the taste had been improving each day, which was a positive. Once I finished constructing the cabin, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to try and grow some small vegetables myself.Taking a bite with a stick, it proved to be full of juice, which seeped into my mouth and made it water.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any sort of significant movement this morning. I think things are probably going as well as planned.\u201dLortel covered her mouth with a modest movement as she chewed on her food and continued speaking. Yennekar seemed to be upset, as she was pouting without saying anything.\u201cAfter coming this far, all that\u2019s left is to wait it out for the results.\u201d\u201cAlright. That\u2019s a good thing, but don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d\u201cOf course, Ed.\u201dLortel smiled brightly as she spoke in a cheerful voice, which was unusual.\u201cWell, there's a lot of work that needs to be done now. There\u2019s lots of things to clean up in the aftermath, and I also need to pay you back.\u201d\u201cTwenty gold coins isn\u2019t a big deal for your wallet though, is it?\u201d\u201cNo matter how small the amount is, it must be paid back thoroughly. After all, I'm a merchant. Is there anything else you want, other than the cash? There is some remaining inventory in the branch warehouse that I can allow you to have.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I feel like you\u2019ll take advantage of me by giving me goods instead of money.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dLortel twisted her reddish hair as she laughed aloud.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t play a game to try and trick you. Why are you trying to make me sad?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 As for something that comes to my mind right now\u2026 Maybe construction materials? \u2026 No, I know what I want. How about leftover magically engineered goods?\u201d\u201cMagically engineered goods?\u201dI had already finished deciding on what to choose for my production skill slot. Magic Engineering and Spiritual Infusion.Between those two, the Magic Engineering related skill required you to be exposed to as many magically engineered products as possible if you wanted to increase your proficiency. That was why it was a lot easier if you knew someone who could distribute them.\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be practical. Just any cheap leftover items you have.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dLortel put her hand on her chin, seemingly lost in thought.\u201cYou can let me know after you check your inventory.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll think about it now. I\u2019ve pretty much memorized everything already.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve memorized all of that?\u201d\u201cWatching and checking the inventory\u2019s stock everyday, I can always memorize certain items that don\u2019t have much of a change.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure. It wasn\u2019t something that I was seriously considering at the moment, but Lortel was already considering my request more seriously and aggressively than I had expected.\u201cBut is there a reason for why you\u2019re asking for cheap, unpopular items?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s not going to be all that useful, and it would be ridiculous to ask for something expensive, creating another debt or a burden.\u201d\u201cAhh~. If that\u2019s the case, then\u2026 Just wait a moment as I try to find something\u2026\u201dLortel smiled as she stepped out of the way for a moment, falling into thought. I waited for a minute or two\u2026 but after she sat there thinking for a while, I reached out to grab some more food.\u201cCome to think of it, Yennekar\u2014I would like to ask you for a favor.\u201d\u201cHhmng?\u201dYennekar, who was eating a piece of fish, trembled. Perhaps she was surprised by me suddenly calling her name, or maybe she was just choking. I quickly handed her some water.\u201cPuhaaaaa!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have a favor to ask?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - HarleyJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *I had been hesitant to bring it up, but after thinking about it for a bit, I realized that there was no reason for me to be so worried.\u201cThese days, I\u2019m trying to learn more about spirit-type magic. I also want to try making a contract with a low-ranking spirit. I was wondering if I could get some help with that.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dYennekar twisted her braided hair, humming thoughtfully. Suddenly, she let out an \u2018aha!\u2019 and nodded her head.\u201cThinking about it, Takan has been talking about you so much, Ed. His neck is still a bit stiff after you cut it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look like that, Ed. Takan may be a bit grumpy, but I still made it clear to him. Because of the circumstances, you didn\u2019t have a choice. I told him to quit being so emotional, or I\u2019d get mad!\u201dPicturing her getting mad, all I could picture is her just stamping her feet and puffing her cheeks out. Of course, that wasn\u2019t very trustworthy.There was nothing good that came from being on bad terms with a high-ranking spirit, but\u2026 He probably wouldn\u2019t take his anger out on me, right?\u201cTakan still hasn\u2019t fully recovered his strength yet. Still, I know that you were the one who was able to block him while he was affected by Berserk\u2026 He\u2019s grumbling a bit, but I don\u2019t think he has any hard feelings. Anyway, Ed. Your Spiritual Resonance must be quite high.\u201d\u201cI guess that\u2019s right.\u201dThat was the result of defeating not only Takan, but also all the other spirits that were under Yennekar\u2019s control.I was sure that Yennekar knew quite well that it was a situation that I didn\u2019t have another choice in.In the first place, Yennekar still seemed to hold a significant amount of guilt over what happened, and she didn\u2019t want to keep talking about it anymore.\u201cThen\u2026 Can you see it\u2026?\u201dYennekar suddenly spoke, spreading her arms wide.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I guess your sensitivity to see spirits that haven\u2019t been manifested yet is too weak\u2026 Do you want to try grabbing my hand, Ed?\u201d\u201cYour hand? All of a sudden?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, no. That\u2019s not what I meant! It\u2019s because there is something I want to show you. That\u2019s all!\u201dI didn\u2019t really have any suspicions in the first place as I grabbed her hand.\u201cO-oh. Ed, y-your hand is bigger than I thought.\u201d\u201cYour hand is just small.\u201dSaying that, I closed my eyes for a moment before opening them back up. I couldn\u2019t help but be startled.\u201cFifty-three animals\u2026 that\u2019s a bit less than usual\u2026\u201dRabbit, hawk, deer, tiger, eagle, puppy, sparrow\u2026 numerous animals, the number of which was difficult to list, were all around us. Each of them had a different size and element making up their body. It was an incredibly rare sight to see.Sitting on Yennekar\u2019s shoulder was a sparrow made of wind. Wrapping around her right arm was a baby boa constrictor. A puppy, who had dirt falling off its feet, was hanging around her feet. There was a deer made of fire rubbing its face against Yennekar\u2019s cheek.\u201c\u2026Is it always like this?\u201d\u201cUsually they are more spread out, but whenever I come into the northern forest they always come here and gather like this. This snake, you can see it clearly, right? It hasn\u2019t been long since it changed into a low-ranking spirit from a fluid spirit.\u201d\u201cHow many spirits did you make a contract with in the first place?\u201d\u201cHm? I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I haven\u2019t made a contract with all of these guys here\u2026 Hm\u2026 There\u2019s one high-ranking spirit, six mid-ranking spirits, and as for low-ranking spirits\u2026 I haven\u2019t been counting each and every one of them. Though, I think it has definitely passed triple digits.\u201dReaching the lowest level of the Spiritual Resonance and Spiritual Understanding skills, you get two spirit slots at most.Really, she was just a girl that was born loved by the spirits.There are around 15 spirits that I could see, but also considering the ones that I still couldn\u2019t detect, just how many are there?\u201cAnyway, if you\u2019re interested in spiritual studies, I can teach you some things. But I feel that I am much better in terms of the sensory aspects, rather than the theoretical aspect\u2026 If it\u2019s just simple magic theory, Ayla is much more knowledgeable than I am\u2026 But even then, it\u2019s still more important for you to develop your practical Elementalism sense\u2026\u201dTaylee\u2019s companion Ayla was a bit uncertain when it came to fighting power, but she had a deep knowledge of magic.Just like the way areas of science and senses were different, Yennekar was an Elementalist type that is extremely developed in terms of senses.If you wanted to learn spiritual studies, which had a thick barrier of entry, then it was best to get help from another elementalist.In terms of spiritual studies, nobody had a more developed level of sense than Yennekar. At least within Silvenia.\u201cAnyway, seeing as how you\u2019re already thinking about your first contract, you must have quite a high level in terms of Spiritual Resonance. When I first met you, you were a complete stranger to it all. You\u2019ve grown up so fast, Ed. It seems like you have quite a bit of talent.\u201dI'm sure Yennekar knew why I was able to grow so fast\u2026 More than anything else, the biggest reason was because I cut off Takan\u2019s head.\u201cOther than that, I\u2019d also like to get some help from you in terms of senses. There\u2019s a limit to how much I can do in a simple academic spiritual studies class.\u201d\u201cSure! Don\u2019t worry about that!\u201dYennekar Palerover was someone who was hard to make a personal connection with on purpose. Having such a reliable fellow student, I should have been benefiting from her.Where else could I get one-on-one tutoring from an elementalist at that level? If I could take advantage of it, then I needed to do as much as I could\u2026 but I didn\u2019t think it was right to say it like that.Anyway, Yennekar was helping me out of pure goodwill.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be Ed\u2019s master!\u201dYennekar laughed before clearing her throat.In order to act dignified, she put her arms on her hips and she cleared her throat, all while huffing confidently. Though, rather than dignified, her expression and appearance was more cute than anything else.Still, I didn\u2019t want to provoke Yennekar\u2014who was starting to feel better\u2014unnecessarily, so I clapped my hands while exclaiming, \u2018Ohhhh!\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t worry! When it comes to spiritual magic, I\u2019ll take responsibility and raise your senses! I\u2019ll make it so you can make a contract with a mid-ranking spirit in no time!\u201dSeeing her smile while clearing her throat, I inclined my head in gratitude.\u201cThen\u2026 I guess you're having a hard time when it comes to communicating directly with spirits?\u201d\u201cSometimes my voice seems to reach the lower-ranking spirits that I see, but I can\u2019t really hear what they are saying to me.\u201d\u201cReally? Hm\u2026 Considering the level of magic you deal with, that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Your Spiritual Resonance and Mana Resonance have raised to a pretty decent level already, no?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah they did.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Are you sure that it\u2019s not just that the spirits aren\u2019t talking with you? Even if you can\u2019t hear them clearly, you should at least be able to hear the spirits vaguely\u2026\u201dYennekar said that as she thrust her index finger at the sparrow sitting on her shoulder.The cute sparrow quickly moved onto Yennekar\u2019s index finger.\u201cCharis! Will you try to talk to Ed?\u201d[Lady Yennekar! This guy\u2026 because\u2026 can\u2019t!]Oh\u2026! I really could hear it vaguely\u2026!As I started to focus on my senses with magic power, the voice started to become clear.[In the first place, in order to hear what we are saying, he will need to raise his resonance to a higher level!]\u201cIs that so? But I think Ed\u2019s rate of growth is already quite fast.\u201d[Think about this man\u2019s daily life! Just how much time would he have to train in magic! You know it, too! At our weekly report meeting at your window in Dex Hall, room 203, there were reports that he was running out of food in his storage and that he needed to focus on the construction of the cabin immediately. So he didn\u2019t have time to put his mind to anything elseaughka\u2014]The flow of magic power began to twist as the sparrow-shaped spirit, once sitting on the palm of her hand, disappeared in an instant.\u201c\u2026 Did you hear that?\u201d\u201cVaguely?\u201dPure Silence.\u201cBut what is this weekly report meeting?\u201d\u201cWell, as you know, the northern forest is a place where a lot of spirits live. So, it\u2019s like a meeting to report on any major changes that occur, or something else they want to report to me, so I can check in on the place? It\u2019s also where they can report to me if they feel uncomfortable with something. While it happens sometimes, just a little bit, news about you may come up. Though it\u2019s really not a whole lot. How should I say it\u2026? They just bring up you briefly, for the sake of manners\u2026? It\u2019s like the feeling of greeting a neighbor that you met in passing?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201dIt seemed that she was speaking in a weird, roundabout way. What was important right then was ultimately my spirit-type magic training method.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll regularly check on things like your Spiritual Resonance. I\u2019m probably the best within this academy when it comes to senses. In the first place, there aren\u2019t many people who have even developed spirit sense.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thanks for that.\u201dIn any case, with the help of a skilled elementalist, my spirit-type magic would improve quickly in a short amount of time. It really was great that I could become friends with her.Though, I\u2019m still thinking quite a bit about Magic Engineering.\u201cOh, are you finished talking?\u201dStill grinning like always, Lortel entered the conversation.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s finish discussing the magically engineered items. It seems that we have way more left over than I thought, so I can provide you with more than enough.\u201dI was getting good news from this side, too.\u201cAnd most of the products are actually being treated as useless assets, since they have either already expired or have not been sold for more than a certain period of time.\u201d\u201cOh. Then, can you sell it to me for the lowest price possible? You can calculate using the twenty coins you promised me and take it from that.\u201d\u201cSelling at a lower price? I\u2019m quite upset hearing those words come from you. Anyway, it\u2019s not a huge amount of money, and they are practically just dead assets\u2026 So, even for free\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, Lortel shook her head for a moment, looking back and forth between Yennekar and me.Lortel looked at me with a puzzled expression, before smiling again with that foxlike smile.\u201cFree\u2026 Having the title of a merchant, maybe that\u2019s a bit too much for me, hm?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I already completely understand your position, anyway.\u201d\u201cStill, I\u2019ll sell it to you for the lowest price possible. Whenever there is a useless piece of inventory, we can continue making business. However, since it involves the exchange of money, we need to write a contract\u2026 Also, whenever I sell it to you, I need to write a certificate of sale.\u201d\u201cDo you usually go that far just for a contract of sale?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s because we have a special compromise, that\u2019s why. Because I\u2019m giving it to you for cheap? Hahaha. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201dLortel smiled happily as she continued.\u201cSince you\u2019ll have to renew the contract every time, you should visit the Elte Company\u2019s branch in the commercial district every so often. Well, since you\u2019ll be going anyway, it\u2019ll be great for us to have a cup of tea and exchange stories with each other. Considering the change in sales, the more frequent the contract the better, so how about once a week\u2026 No, how about once every three days?\u201d\u201cWell, since it\u2019s a contract, I guess it can\u2019t be helped but be a bit cumbersome. Don\u2019t even think about trying to take advantage of me.\u201d\u201cOh my, as I told you last time\u2026 The secret to Elte Company\u2019s longevity is having a conscience.\u201dIt was really important that I have a place in which I could be provided with magically engineer items safely.I would just have to fix up the details when I went there later. It wasn\u2019t not that I didn\u2019t know how to look at magically engineered items.\u201cBut\u2026 Is it really okay to give this much to me for free\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, Yennekar butted into the conversation.\u201cEd helped you so much this time. If it\u2019s an amount that won't cause too much damage to the books, then there\u2019s no need to be so strict on the contract.\u201dYennekar spoke in a strangely stiff tone, and Lortel responded in a firm tone.\u201cI\u2019m still a merchant. Even though he may be my savior, I can\u2019t just give away items for free. That is against my work ethic.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying! That\u2019s just making excuses!\u201d\u201cExcuses? What excuses?\u201dBlinking her eyes with an innocent expression on her face, Lortel looked at Yennekar as if she was a girl that didn\u2019t know anything about the world.Of course, there was no way Lortel would be such a girl.In fact, there seemed to be room for further consideration in regards to negotiating the price.There was a high chance that, if Lortel was grilled about her involvement with the Occupation of Ophelis Hall, I would have a more advantageous position in the contract.That was quite a sharp point that Yennekar realized. You couldn\u2019t ignore Lortel\u2019s heart, which would do anything evil just to make a single coin more.I sat around thinking for a while, considering how I should end the conversation.\u201cOh my. I didn\u2019t expect to see Lady Lortel here.\u201dTurning my head and looking into the forest, I saw the face of a familiar visitor.\u201c\u2026 Ms. Bell?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s the matter?\u201dSeeing me, Lortel, and Yennekar all sitting around the campfire, Bell suddenly pressed on her temples and closed her eyes gently.\u201cNo, I apologize. I feel like my head is already spinning, seeing all of you here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cThis situation doesn\u2019t seem to be very peaceful. I apologize for coming here so suddenly.\u201dLortel was the first person whose eyes went cold.She didn\u2019t want to see anyone related to Ophelis Hall. She didn\u2019t want her location to be discovered.Though, actually, at that moment Lortel\u2019s victory was pretty much guaranteed. It was already time for the sale of the equipment to be finished. If Elte was trying to defeat Lortel, he should have made it to the cabin by the night before.Nevertheless, just in case something had happened, she was waiting to come out of the cabin for a little longer. She wanted to be sure to enjoy the fireworks, she was just waiting for concrete news of her victory.Still, Bell\u2019s uniform seemed to make Lortel feel uncomfortable.Compared to her usual neat and tidy senior maid uniform, this one was fancier. It was the outfit of the head maid.The fact that Bell had already taken over the position as the head maid after Elris meant that the Ophelis Hall incident had finished up well, at least according to the original timeline.Bell arrived looking as elegant and peaceful as ever as she sat down carefully across from the party.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry that I have come to bring you some unfortunate news, but\u2026\u201dAnd with her eyes closed\u2026 she continued to slowly talk.I could already guess what Bell was going to say, so I looked away from her quietly.Staring at the crackling bonfire, I threw in a few more pieces of firewood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Cat, Cat, Cat (3)The assistant professor, Cleoh Elpin, had her head down on the desk in her private laboratory.Her fluttering, wavy blond hair was spread out across the table as she grabbed her glasses from where they sat beside her.Most assistant professors\u2014who would begin working as teachers after receiving a degree in elemental studies\u2014spent the first month enjoying the romance and beauty as they walked around campus.However, once they realized how much they needed to endure before becoming successful professors with influence, they quickly changed their minds. They would then desire to return back to their degree program, focusing on their studies.The same was true for Cleoh, who was in her second semester as an assistant professor.\u201cI want to die\u2026\u201dCleoh was proud of her appearance\u2014pale and baby smooth skin, with eyes that could instantly captivate others. Despite her increasing age, she was quite protective of her uniquely youthful beauty.But when she looked up for a brief moment and saw herself in the mirror, she resembled a walking corpse.Despite the fact that she took good care of her skin every day in fear of having dry skin, the dark circles under her eyes were gradually expanding. Soon, they would be big enough that they would resemble two continents coming together.\u201cI want to die\u2026!!!\u201dEven though she was yelling quietly, no one was listening.Even if it was just a beginner course, there was still so much to do to prepare for it.At the same time, she also has to pay attention to the academic growth of each student.Then, in addition to that, over just one semester she had submitted more than six research proposals to the Organization of Magicians. However, every single one of them was rejected.It would have been great if they had explained the reason for the rejection, but it seemed like it was mostly due to their stance of not trusting rookie assistant professors.In regards to her research, since she couldn't proactively update the amount of data, the sources she was able to include in her paper were limited.Because of the lack of research results, the school was starting to put pressure on her as well.In the meantime, she had to wonder just what was with the sheer number and types of incidents that were occuring. Most of the post-processing work regarding those incidents was left to Cleoh, the assistant professor.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe had fear trickling down her back. She worried that, at her current rate, she would become a wrinkly old lady by the time she was a professor.Cleoh used to be called a gifted child, having been sent to academy at an early age. Then, at the young age of twenty, she had completed all of her advanced degree programs. Later, she even received her own private laboratory as an assistant professor.Other than a few honorary professors, she was the youngest person to achieve such a feat within the school. Nevertheless, her life was now like this.She had thought that her life would have started blossoming, but instead she had no idea that all of these difficult hardships would be waiting for her.Knock, KnockAs she was moping pessimistically about her life, she suddenly heard a knock coming from her door. Did her assistant come to give a report after checking the equipment for the elemental studies class?Whoosh!Before Cleoh could tell them to enter, the door swung open as she looked up. She spotted someone with a skull-like face.\u201c... Were you taking a break?\u201dIt was the senior professor in charge of the 1st years, infamously known as \u2018The Mannerless Skull Face.\u2019 He also happened to have been Cleoh\u2019s advisor from the moment she started her degree.Cleoh had lived more than five years of her life as a student of the stubborn Professor Glast. Having that type of history between them, seeing him here now there was nothing to feel awkward about.However, she had a bad feeling about this. It stemmed from him coming all the way up to her lab.\u201cOh, my. Professor Glast. What brings you to my laboratory? Would you like a cup of coffee?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine, Cleoh. I\u2019ll just talk about a bit of business, then head out.\u201dCleoh felt a cold sweat running down the back of her neck, but continued to smile without showing her unease.\u201cWh-What reason\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid you receive the report on the accident at Ophelis Hall?\u201d\u201c... Yes.\u201d\u201cThe inspection department has finished their investigation regarding the truth behind the incident. And the date of the disciplinary committee meeting to punish the one behind the incident has been set. Though, the school said there seems to currently be a lack of members that are going to observe the meeting. At this rate, only the dean himself will go.\u201d\u201cI-I see. What about the 3rd year senior professor, Olveig\u2026?\u201d\u201cFor academic reasons, he will be going to the Organization of Magicians.\u201d\u201cProfessor Kelbraim\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s busy consulting the royal family of Kroel. I couldn\u2019t interfere with his affairs with the imperial family.\u201d\u201cOh! I heard that Professor Delphina has returned from her vacation!\u201d\u201cShe got hurt. She is currently experiencing back pain.\u201d\u2018What about yourself, Professor Glast?\u2019 is what she wanted to ask, but she held it in. She was sure that he would go off to research his Celestial Magic, making up some ridiculous excuse.\u201cYou can just read over the report regarding this case and make your own judgment. Then, you can write your opinion on the given form and leave the rest of the simpler paperwork to an assistant under you. But make sure to make the important decisions yourself.\u201d\u201cProfessor Glast, I\u2019m sorry. However, as it\u2019s the beginning of the semester and I'm in charge of the beginner course\u2026 I\u2019ve been quite busy lately. And I also have more than three research papers left that I need to write, so I'm already in a bit of a crisis\u2026\u201d\u201cI see. Then you\u2019ll just have to sleep less.\u201dNodding her head and accepting her fate, she watched Professor Glast drop the files on the relevant materials before leaving the laboratory.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCleoh opened up the files without a change in expression. Looking it over and checking through it, it was a brief summary regarding the truth behind the occupation of Ophelis Hall.It was considered a \u2018one man crime\u2019 by Elris, the head maid of Ophelis Hall.She had tried to persuade Shaney and Kelly, and negotiated with Willain to use Ophelis Hall as a hostage to voice her dissatisfaction.The primary motives behind the dissatisfaction came from the fact that, despite her worsening health, she was still required to continue with the same amount of labor intensive work.Nobody expected her to cause such a large amount of damage, as she was viewed by others as sincere with a good character.In addition to that, Taylee, Ayla, and Elvira were also brought up. As were Ed, Yennekar, and Ziggs\u2014who were listed as subject to further investigation\u2014but\u2026 If the truth was clear, then they would consider skipping any sort of additional investment into the investigation.There was no reason for Cleoh to think it was strange that Lortel\u2019s name was not brought up anywhere in the files.Anyway, after looking through it all she got an estimate of just how much work there was to take care of.\u201cWhat the\u2026? This isn\u2019t even all that much.\u201dCleoh took off her high-grade glasses, holding them in her hand.\u201cChecking through the investigation proposal, submitting the academic opinion file, determining if further investigation is necessary\u2026 Attending the committee, checking to make sure there were no mistakes in the short hand report\u2026 Reporting it to the academic management team and the dean's office, then reporting back to Professor Glast. Basically, as long as I report on it well and submit the collected data to the records room, I\u2019ll be done\u2026!\u201dAt the same time, shouldn\u2019t she be doing both academic work and research work?Cleoh folded her glasses as she put the stack on the desk and opened the window beside her, shouting into the air.\u201cEven though I\u2019m the youngest professor, I\u2019m still only a human\u2026!!! Someone save me\u2026!!!!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I forgot to tell you, but several research projects have been rejected this semester due to a lack of budget. They wanted you to go check and report on assets that the academy can sell. You can just have your assistant do this\u2014\u201dSuddenly, she looked back and found Professor Glast standing in the room.Cleoh hiccupped as she turned her head. The skull-faced professor stood still, as if he didn't care.\u201c... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cTry to finish in a day or two. I don\u2019t really care, but just make sure to take care of your work.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes\u2026\u201dCleoh sat down as she lowered her head. She looked like someone who had already given up on life.On the second night, the homing pigeon came flying back.\u2018The proposal for the sale of equipment has been completed. Review of the proposal for the dismissal of the head has been completed. Elte\u2019s authority has nearly been fully revoked. His removal is guaranteed. The situation is nearly complete. Please report your personal status.\u2019The tiny parchment was full of compressed information. Despite it being so simple, it was a note that was full of secrets and held a terrifying amount of power.\u201cIf the situation has progressed this far, then my father should already be back at the headquarters, fighting his last battle. Even though it\u2019s a useless struggle\u2026 Anyway, at the very least there\u2019s no reason for him to pay attention to Silvenia anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the chance that Elte has something else hidden up his sleeve?\u201d\u201cWell, since he is as cunning as me\u2026 It\u2019s probably not zero. Though, I still don\u2019t have a choice but to trust in Slogg. He\u2019s aiming for a position as the next head. Since I\u2019m far away from the action, there\u2019s not much else I can do.\u201dThe burning campfire drove away the darkness of the night. As it was now late, Yennekar had already left for the dorms.Late summer\u2026 Or was it early fall?The northern forest was on the border of starting to change its clothes. Some of the broad-leaved trees in the outskirts had already begun to change their colors.The sound of the bugs had reduced greatly compared to the middle of summer, and the forest at night had become much quieter.When it came to changing clothes, it wasn\u2019t just the forest. It was the same for me, too.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit too shabby, considering it\u2019s a uniform that has been mended?\u201d\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 This much is fine.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Hmmm\u2026\u201dThere was nothing good that would come from me prolonging my absence any longer, so I planned to go to school the next day. I went ahead and tried on my uniform, which was thankfully pretty clean.\u201cWell, right now I\u2019m safe\u2026 So that\u2019s a relief.\u201dWith a big smile, Lortel pulled at her robe\u2019s hem and sat down.\u201cI have quite a lot of work to do right now. I guess it\u2019s just deciding what to do first\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter how hard they work to restore Ophelis Hall, it will still take at least a semester.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ll have to check and see if there are any spaces left in the temporary accommodations\u2026 Then I'll have to clean up the rest of this incident\u2026 But most things seemed to have ended quite well.\u201d\u201cI heard that empty academic offices in the teacher district, as well as the closed buildings in the southern part of the island, were quickly remodeled and turned into temporary accommodations.\u201d\u201cThough they had done so as nicely as possible, being an improvised accommodation filled with students that are coming from Ophelis Hall\u2026 There\u2019s no way they will be satisfied. Though, I guess being in such a situation, there\u2019s not really a choice but to endure it.\u201d\u201cElris seemed to be of the biggest concern, but now it seems like that has all been \u2018concluded\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI threw some more pieces of firewood into the campfire.\u201cElris didn\u2019t disclose the fact that you were the black curtain behind this incident, right?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way she would have. That\u2019s because I\u2026 \u2018paid in advance.\u2019\u201cPaid in advance?\u201d\u201cThink about it, Ed. The head maid Elris will be trying to stay closest to the side that wins between Elte and me.\u201dLortel took out a small piece of parchment. It was given to her by Bell Maya, who had visited after the incident was over.The parchment was a list of orphanages that Elris had sponsored her entire life, the cost of maintaining them for a year, and the method that she could use to sponsor them.\u201cSince my victory was already certain to a degree, she tried to rejoin my side. It's just that\u2026 It\u2019s hard to regain trust, since it was already lost.\u201dElris had already betrayed Lortel once before.Now matter how necessary it might be, would Lortel be able to trust her again?Even if trust was given back out of necessity, it was likely to be disregarded the moment the value of it disappears.Nobody would trust a man who had already betrayed them before.\u201cMs. Elris\u2026 you must already know that I wasn\u2019t planning on trusting you. But as a means to instill confidence in me, you tried to prove yourself by keeping your mouth shut. Well, from my point of view, I don\u2019t want the fact that I am the black curtain behind the entire occupation incident to be revealed. As such, I have no choice but to be on the same side as you.\u201dElris was also a malicious person.Even though her health was deteriorating, the school never listened and the hard work never ceased.Eventually, she would not have been able to work and wouldn\u2019t have been able to take responsibility for the orphanages she was in charge of\u2026 In the end, she bet her whole life on that plan.The back door of Ophelis Hall on that rainy day.I still remembered Shaney\u2019s face, when she looked up at me with her bloodshot eyes.At least those who followed Elris had some understanding of her situation and psychological state.\u201cDo you have any ill feelings towards Elris? After all, she betrayed you.\u201d\u201cOf course I'm very angry. If I meet her again, I won\u2019t hesitate to slap her.\u201d\u201cEven considering that, you look quite relieved.\u201d\u201cWell, right now I'm fine. I'm just rather short on time.\u201dStaring across the fire looking at me, she put her chin in her hands and smiled like a fox.\u201cIn the first place, I\u2019m not a nice enough person to walk around with my heart wide open. If necessary, I\u2019ll even use someone who has stabbed me in the back before. After all, in my world there\u2019s no such thing as an eternal enemy or ally.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then let\u2019s not have a relationship where we hold grudges or hate each other.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dLortel laughed as she stood up from her seat, shaking off the ends of her skirt.Now that her safety was guaranteed to a certain extent, it was time to get to work.Even if Elte\u2019s demise was set in stone, there was no way that a girl as greedy as Lortel would give up on the Sage\u2019s Seal. Since the scale of the incident had gone so far already, I was sure that she would get her hands on the seal.It was time for her to go back to her world, which revolved around business and her life as a merchant.Staying in camp and doing nothing all day except staring blankly at the campfire, or laying down on the ground counting the stars that she could see in the sky through the plentiful trees in the forest\u2026 Such a romantic, peaceful life was only a brief deviation for her.\u201cI'll get going, too. You\u2019re going to come by the company\u2019s local branch later this week to sign the contract, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI put down the bow I was holding, took out poker that was in the campfire, and then cast \u2018Ignite\u2019.For the time being, it would be sustained to some extent by magic power and would take on the role of a torch. The forest got dark at night, and without being familiar with the geography such a light source was a necessity.I went over to Lortel, who was getting ready to leave, and handed her the torch. Lortel looked down, deep in thought, as she let out a \u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019\u201c\u2026 What are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 It\u2019s just that you\u2019re taller than I thought.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cNo matter how hard it may be, maybe I should do something a bit extreme to overtake that girl\u2026\u201dSuddenly, she started to mumble something that was hard to understand. I stuck out my hand with the torch to try and send her on her way quickly.But Lortel didn\u2019t take the torch, and instead randomly began to talk about something else.\u201cDid you know? Relationships are all about push and pull.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just like your tie. See how it\u2019s all crooked?\u201dLortel approached me with a smile as she grabbed my tie.\u201cYou have to pull the back part of the knot like this, and push the front part like that, to tie it nice and straight.\u201d\u201cEither way, there isn\u2019t anyone here looking, so why would I wear it so uncomfortably?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing wrong with always being well behaved? We are students from SIlvenia, after all.\u201dBefore I could say anything back, Lortel grabbed my tie with one hand and pulled on it sharply.To my surprise, my head was pulled forward. Lortel, thinking it was time, stood on her tippy toes\u2014\u2026\u2026\u201c... The raspberries we had for dinner were so good, right? Thinking of it again, it was quite nice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my. I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be so serious.\u201d\u201cWatch the line.\u201d\u201cYou upset me\u2026\u201dOnly then did Lortel take the torch and take a few staggering steps back.Ignoring the fact that she said she was upset, she covered up her smile with her hand. If this girl had a tail, it would definitely be a fox\u2019s.\u201cIf you pull or push too much, you won\u2019t be popular. Next time, I\u2019m going to have you pull me, Ed.\u201dShe turned her body away from me, but still looked back with a smile as she added on.\u201cI\u2019ll have to practice pushing, as well.\u201dAnd so, Lortel disappeared into the dark forest. The light from the torch gradually moved further away, and even though it would shake once in a while or even fall to the ground, she still wouldn't lose her way.I stood in the place that I said goodbye to Lortel as I wiped my face.I felt like I had been hit hard in the back of the head with a hammer. First, I needed to calm down and get a hold of myself.I tried to avoid getting involved with the main storyline characters more than was necessary. However, as expected, things didn\u2019t go the way I wanted them to.Above anything else, Elte\u2019s demotion had been brought forward way earlier due to the occupation of Ophelis Hall.One of the main storylines\u2014Act 2, Chapter 10\u2019s \u201cBattle for the Sage\u2019s Seal\u201d\u2014was the story in which Elte was\u00a0supposed\u00a0to be demoted.In other words, as the story progressed there would be a big hole in the storyline.However, since it was either Elte or Lortel who would have ended up taking their leave, in the end there was no choice other than taking Lortel\u2019s side. She had more of a role within the main storyline\u2026 In the first place, I didn\u2019t have a choice to make at all.Anyway, Elte\u2019s demotion was something that was bound to happen. I needed to try and think of it as the story\u2019s sequence being changed a bit, and that it wouldn\u2019t have much of a major impact on the storyline\u2026 But even as I considered that, I started to feel my anxiety grow.I\u2019d already experienced it many times over. The fact was, even the smallest of influences could have big changes on the progression of the story.Theoretically, as long as I thought that everything was going smoothly, the major progression of the story should have been about the same. However\u2026 I couldn\u2019t be sure of that anymore.Looking up at the sky, the stars above were as beautiful as always, and the moon was bright.The chirping sound of bugs lingered as the crackling of the campfire remained the same, but\u2026 I felt like the path the story was heading in would only continue to twist and change.Watching the storyline progress smoothly from the sidelines, while only taking action when necessary, was my plan of action. That had never changed.Nevertheless\u2026 I felt anxious, as if I was starting to get sucked into the center of the story against my will. As I considered that, I couldn\u2019t help but scrub at my face.I wasn't someone with ambitions. I just wanted to receive my diploma and take care of my own specs.That plan of action seemed all too simple\u2026 But it wasn\u2019t all too far in the future that I would start to realize how foolish and difficult of a challenge that was.Summer had passed and autumn had arrived.It was the start of the second semester.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Anyone Can Be a Professor (1)[The fire fox kissed Young Master Ed.]It had already been more than three days since the second semester began. The classes were slowly starting to progress along, like a sail that caught the wind.For an honor student like Yennekar, the progression of class was of little meaning to her. So, under the pretense of an illness, she was absent for three days. And yet, she still had no burdens in terms of school.Still, for writing-related subjects such as Magic History and Magic Power Theory, if she didn\u2019t pay attention her grades would be ruined in the blink of an eye. Because of that, it was time for her to pick up the pen again. Nevertheless, having constant communication with the spirits was also the main job of an Elementalist. It wasn\u2019t something she could neglect, so it was a busy time for her.Leaving Dex Hall, which was across from the bottom of the right mountain and on the outskirts of the commercial district, Yennekar was sitting and leaning against a zelkova tree. The spirits gathered around her, like usual.For some reason, the number of spirits that crowded near the zelkova tree were quite high that day. Both the mid-ranking wind spirit Pesci and the mid-ranking fire spirit Takan were gathered together, as if they were stationed at a military camp.\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d[You can\u2019t leave this alone, Lady Yennekar.]It had always been the case that they would report, one by one, on trivial things that occurred in the northern forest. But recently, it felt like the stories the spirits brought up regarding Ed had been increasing in number.As for Yennekar, she listened to those stories with a sense of unease, though she didn\u2019t particularly hate listening to them.However, today\u2019s breaking news as the spirits were chatting amongst themselves came out of the blue.[There\u2019s no way to know when that firefox-like girl will strike again. If we don\u2019t get our hands dirty\u2026][What are you going to do with your hands?]Charis, a low-ranking wind spirit in the shape of a sparrow, flapped her wings as she vented her anger. Meanwhile Pesci, a spirit in the shape of a lion, kept responding to her politely.[This is something for Lady Yennekar to decide. What can we do about it?]\u201cWait a minute. What are you talking about? They kissed?\u201dYennekar, who could not follow along with the story, asked again. But this time Takan, who was lying around the zelkova tree with his huge body, responded.[I saw it, too. It was quite passionate. As expected, youth is great.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[The firefox-like woman knows how to play with a person's heart. A game of push and pull, to stimulate one\u2019s ticklish heart\u2026 I was watching Ed, and if it weren\u2019t for that guy being the way he is, she would have gone overboard.]\u201cWhat are you even talking about?!\u201d[Are you going to make me repeat what I already said, Lady Yennekar? I\u2019m saying that I think the firefox has crossed the line.]\u201cWhat about Ed? What was his reaction?!\u201d[Oh, that\u2019s a question that gets straight to the point. When I looked at him, it seemed that he kept his distance. Even though he kissed her, his expression didn\u2019t change one bit\u2026 I was quite amazed by what I saw.]As if to console the stunned Yennekar, Takan continued to talk in his serious and profound tone.[He took it so coldly. Just watching it made me cringe. I couldn\u2019t believe that his reaction could still be so cold after all of that. It must be either one of the two things. The fallen aristocrat was either a eunuch, or he doesn\u2019t see her as a woman at all.]\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026 A relief\u2026\u201dYennekar tried to catch her breath, before she suddenly gulped it down. A relief. Just what was a relief? Was this really the time to catch her breath, saying it was a relief?[Takan, I think you are being too straightforward. As always.][Geez, why do you always gotta do this, Pesci? It would be worse for me to be considerate, constantly changing my words around. It didn\u2019t look like you were all that relieved, Yennekar. Well, it\u2019s not exactly great that that fallen aristocrat is trying to distance himself from that firefox to such an extent.]\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dTakan was a high-ranking spirit, who had lived for such a long period of time that it would be impossible to count by hand. Seeing all sorts of people throughout his life, he could naturally see through anyone.[In my experience, that firefox-like girl is the type who gets more obsessed the more she gets knocked down. Just as she seems to be a human full of greed\u2026 Once she decides to make someone her own, she will take out their liver, gallbladder, and rest of their insides all for herself. If you don\u2019t do something, he\u2019ll be taken away, Yennekar.]\u201cBut\u2026 But even then\u2026 You said that Ed\u2019s reaction was cold\u2026\u201d[Usually, guys like him are good at offense, but weak in defense. No matter how stubborn of a person he may be, as long as she keeps pushing with all her heart then\u2026 What I\u2019m trying to say is that, ultimately, there\u2019s no such thing as a fortress that won\u2019t collapse.]As Takan started to grow uncomfortable with the way he was laying down, he adjusted himself. The low-ranking spirits around him were swept away. Whenever he would change the position of his gigantic body, all the other spirits would have to keep their eye out to not fly away.[Like a princess in a fairytale, if you shyly sit around falling in love thinking \u2018Someday he\u2019ll look after me~\u2019, do you think that relationship can ever come about? Not in real life. There\u2019s a rule that you need to get filthy and fight dirty to win.][Takan, don\u2019t you think your way of talking is too old and crude.][Did I say something wrong?][It\u2019s not wrong, but\u2026 You could phrase it more nicely, you know.][Why should I have to change up the way I speak? That\u2019s too frustrating.]Takan swung his tail as he moved his reptilian-like eyes towards Yennekar.Yennekar had already turned pale from Pesci and Takan\u2019s words.[Anyway, Yennekar. Don\u2019t just sit around doing nothing. Start making some progress. I heard that you agreed to teach him some spirit-type magic. There will be a reason for you two to be alone for a while. Are you planning on wasting such a great opportunity?]\u201cE-Even so\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d[What do you mean you don't know.? Then next time you meet, you\u2019ll have to start with a kiss. Since you\u2019re falling behind, it\u2019s fine to get a little angry and impatient, Yennekar.]At that moment, as she started to let her image run wild, she opened her mouth and leaned back against the zelkova tree again. She wasn\u2019t exactly being interrogated, but she still stepped back as if she was being pushed. Stuttering out she responded,\u201cWh-why would you say something so shameful\u2026?!\u201d[The fact is, that firefox randomly kissed him out of the blue. That situation doesn\u2019t even make sense in the first place. Something like that has already happened, so are you going to keep sitting down, smiling kindly?][Takan\u2026 Aren\u2019t you asking too much from Yennekar, who is so innocent?][Well, wouldn\u2019t it be a good thing if it all goes well? I\u2019m not really fond of that fallen aristocrat, but\u2026 Well, for a male he is pretty good. He seemed to be born with a calm nature, and he was able to cut off my head while I was under the influence of Berserk\u2026 And he gets along decently with Yennekar, who is quite emotional.][Seriously\u2026 Please refrain from making those comments. It sounds like you\u2019re trying to find a groom for your granddaughter.][Well, it can\u2019t be helped, since I\u2019m old.]The pace of the story\u2026\u2018I can\u2019t keep up with the pace of this story,\u2019 is what Yennekar thought as her thoughts grew troubled.\u2018Do\u2026 Do I really have to do something? But what am I supposed to do\u2026?\u2019For Yennekar, who got overwhelmed just by holding his hand, kissing was in a realm far away from hers.If it were a situation where she needed to consider doing something more\u2026 she would need to overcome the fear of something so massive and indescribable\u2026 The so-called cosmic horror realm.Perhaps seeing Yennekar break into a cold sweat, the mid-ranking wind spirit Pesci added a few words as well.[Well, you don\u2019t have to be so nervous about it, Lady Yennekar. I don\u2019t know about that part Takan was so rudely referring to, but\u2026 I felt a strange sense of comfort in the way young master Ed was treating you. Much different than how he treated that firefox.]\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d[Yes. I\u2019m not just saying that. Certainly, if you look at it carefully, with sharp eyes\u2026 Ed seemed somewhat comfortable when dealing with you alone. With the other first year students, it felt like he was drawing some type of psychological line. However, it seems that he hasn\u2019t done the same with you.]The detailed Pesci knew about that difference intuitively, but he couldn\u2019t manage to describe what that feeling actually was.Ed\u2019s light and comfortable behavior when dealing with Yennekar was only because she was someone that was no longer a part of the main storyline.Unfortunately, nobody there realized just how powerful of an advantage that was. In the first place, there was no way for them to realize that.[That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have to be in such a rush, Lady Yennekar. After all, you are most charming when you are being yourself.]\u201c\u2026 Is that so? Really? E-Even though Lortel is so aggressive, you\u2019re sure Ed won\u2019t budge\u2026?\u201d[\u2026\u2026]\u201cWhy?! Why didn\u2019t you answer?! Why?!\u201dPesci knew that there was no way to know what the result of hastily agreeing with her would be. Pesci couldn't give her any more insurance than that.Unfortunately, that would only raise Yennekar\u2019s level of anxiety.[Ehhhh! You guys are all so frustrating.]Yennekar was fiddling with her hair, deep in thought about what to do. Pesci was awkwardly scratching his back on the tree trunk.\u2018Can\u2019t we just drop the subject already? Even though it may be an old-fashioned way of thinking, it was still correct.\u2019While having such a fleeting thought, Takan kept his mouth shut\u2014as if to say, \u2018There\u2019s nothing more to say.\u2019[Come to think of it, I sensed a strange flow of magic power coming from the outer part of the northern forest. We should check it out when there\u2019s time.]That\u2019s right, the reason that all the spirits and Yennekar had gathered and were reporting regularly was to make sure there were no abnormalities or difficulties in regards to the spirits.Recently, news of the fallen aristocrat seemed to have changed the focus from that. However, Takan brought them back on topic.\u201c\u2026 Hm?\u201d[It seems to be a magic circle related to Celestial magic, as it\u2019s only active at night. Merilda is figuring out the exact location. If you haven\u2019t been seeing much of her these days, it\u2019s because of that.]\u201cDoes it seem dangerous?\u201d[Well\u2026 It doesn\u2019t look particularly dangerous, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a look.]Although Yennekar was just a student, who didn\u2019t have to take any sort of responsibility to the safety of the school, the events taking place in the northern forest weren\u2019t something that she could ignore as an elementalist.She had to stay at the school for at least another two more years, until she was a fourth year. As such, she can\u2019t afford to fail to pay attention to the northern forest, which is the home to all of the spirits.[I\u2019ll explain the details later. Next time you meet that fallen aristocrat, you must produce some plan\u2014like giving him a kiss or something. Otherwise, you should just give up on him. Something like that.]At that moment, Yennekar began to blush beet red as she kicked Takan. Though her lashing out at him in embarrassment like that didn\u2019t even hurt Takan\u2019s body.Yennekar knew it as well, but she had to do something, even though it might not work.[In the first place, what do you want her to do, Takan? If the firefox girl has already gone so far, there\u2019s nothing left to do. If she finally kisses him now, then she will just be considered a latecomer.][That's quite a sharp point, Pesci. Even though I told you to go ahead and do something like that, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be anything as intense as what she did. Rather, it wouldn\u2019t even be a bad idea to bring out a more innocent and refreshing appearance instead. Anyway, this is a situation where you need to make some type of move\u2026][Oh\u2026]For Takan, who was quite stubborn and stereotypical in the way he thought, it was a pretty good point. Even Pesci had to agree.\u2018Your charm is more important than your actions.\u2019[But Yennekar\u2026 Try thinking it over. What do you think\u2026? What do you feel, thinking of the scene and exciting situation, being with him\u2026?]He knew that it would be hard to get a plausible answer out of Yennekar, as she was already overloaded, but he couldn\u2019t help but ask.What was Yennekar\u2019s picture of romance like? It was really important to confirm the point, for the sake of her future progression. It was something that required more courage than you would think, as it was embarrassing to reveal one's own fantasies. However, it was something that had to be clearly decided on.Yennekar, who was at her limit, leaned against the trunk of the zelkova tree\u2026 Difficulty ended up forcing out an answer.\u201c\u2026 A relationship where we support each other\u2026\u201d[\u2026\u2026][\u2026\u2026]In the first place, that was just the type of person their master was.Realizing that fact again, both Takan and Pesci had no choice but to let out deep sighs.* * *\u201cOkay\u2026 Ahh~. Say Ahh~.\u201d\u201cAhh~.\u201dI blew on the soup before putting it into Lucy\u2019s Mouth. The small spoon fit perfectly inside her small mouth.Lucy ate the soup as if she were a baby bird eating its food\u2026 She swallowed it in a gulp, then stuck out her tongue.\u2018Eughk-! Gross-!\u201d\u201cAs expected, it's hard to get any sort of flavor without having a variety of spices. Should I put off on my training until I can expand the ingredients I have to work with?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t use other people like tasting machines.\u201dWith my blood boiling, I stood back up on my feet and poured the rest of the soup back into the pot, no longer caring.Lucy may have not looked like it, but the flavor of it was actually quite high class. However, it was hard to make a variety of dishes with stronger flavors\u2014like spiciness, saltiness, or sweetness\u2014with just the preserved foods I had in storage.Still, in order for me to properly raise my cooking skill proficiency, I needed to cook proper dishes more often. I couldn\u2019t just make preserved foods.However, I felt like my palate had deteriorated quite a bit since I started living out in the wild. I couldn\u2019t help but ask other people, who had better palates, to taste test for me.Still, considering the impact of the Cooking Skill\u2019s proficiency on the Dexterity stat, I couldn\u2019t simply neglect it\u2026 However, no matter how diverse the ingredients I had available might be, it always seemed to be lacking.[Life Skills Details]Grade: Intermediate CraftsmenSpecialized Fields: WoodworkingHandicraft Lvl 14Design Lvl 9Collecting Skills Lvl 12Woodworking Lvl 13Hunting Lvl 10Fishing Lvl 7Cooking Lvl 6Repairing Lvl 5<Advanced Production Technique Slot: Empty><Advanced Production Technique Slot: Empty>\u201cHm\u2026\u201dAfter finishing chopping up the firewood for the day and sweating up a storm, I went to check on my Life Skills.I tried to check on my Production Skills as much as possible as well, since it was an important groundwork towards my growth. A new problem that had come up recently was the gap between the proficiency of my skills.As I said, the higher the skill\u2019s proficiency was, the slower rate of growth. The Dexterity Stat, which I had the highest number of stats in, was heavily connected to my Life Skills proficiencies. That\u2019s why the growth rate of my Dexterity Stat had inevitably slowed down.That was why it was necessary to raise my lower-proficiency skills as much as possible. After all, compared to my other skills, its growth rate was still okay.I felt like I was going to need to start raising my beginner production skills, which I hadn\u2019t done yet, as well as training the other skills that were lagging behind\u2014such as cooking and repairing\u2026 The problem was, I was too busy just trying to get by with my life as it was.I wanted to spend some of the money I was promised from Lortel on things like ingredients and daily necessities, but\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to waste any money on consumables when the production of my cabin wasn\u2019t even complete.\u201cAs expected\u2026 There isn't enough time\u2026\u201dTo make matters even worse, school had started. I could only spend about five or six hours a day on survival activities. But that was only possible if I actually fell asleep when I was tired.It was time for me to think more on how to efficiently manage my survival activities.\u201cAs for the storyline\u2026 It's probably still fine.\u201dThe worst thing that had happened so far was Elte\u2019s early dismissal. I still wasn\u2019t sure of the cause, but at least the problem was somehow taken care of.I didn\u2019t know what type of effect this incident would cause, but for the moment there didn\u2019t seem to be any noticeable changes.Whenever I had the chance, I was making sure to keep a close eye on the main characters of the story. Thankfully, there didn\u2019t seem to be any problems with them.In the end, the most important characters in the main timeline were the protagonist and the four heroines.Taylee was\u2026 Well, he was part of the combat department, so I didn\u2019t see him too often. However, the rumors suggested that he was no longer considered a failing student. With his current talent and spirit, he might even be able to enter Class B by third year.\u2018Companion Ayla\u2019 seemed to be doing her role of supporting Taylee. When I asked around about her, it seemed that she was always sticking close to Taylee, worrying and supporting him.\u2018The Princess of Benevolence Penia\u2019 also seemed to be doing well, without any problems. Though, it was almost time for her to start her clash with Lortel. I needed to keep an eye out for that.\u2018The Golden Daughter Lortel\u2019 was the most unstable situation, as I didn\u2019t know what type of changes would occur due to Elte\u2019s early dismissal. Apart from that, there didn\u2019t seem to be a change in her plan. She was still trying to take control of the Sage\u2019s Seal. As she had to take the role of Act 2, Chapter 10\u2019s mid boss, I had no choice but to pray that there would be no major abnormalities in regards to her.As for Clarice\u2026 She wouldn\u2019t be starting school until next year, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that.For the time being, I had no choice but to watch the situation as if I were walking on thin ice.Above all else, against Glast\u2014the final boss of Act 2\u2014Taylee\u2019s Swordsmanship skill was needed. That was the only way he would be able to be damaged. In the first place, Celestial magic had a unique structure, so it was hard to control with magic power alone.Taylee\u2019s influence was important, but the behavior of the faculty was also that important.\u201cI\u2019ll have to set a date and time to check them out. But\u2026 I need to make sure to not get involved more than necessary.\u201dAnyway, the work that I had to do immediately was to check the traps and dress the meat. I stretched my shoulders as I walked into the woods.With the cabin\u2019s chimney completed, I would be able to live a stable life. Let\u2019s cheer up\u2026* * *\u201cI have gathered all the records of the case here, Assistant Professor Cleoh.\u201d\u201cThank you, Anise.\u201dOne of the biggest difficulties for a first-year assistant professor was trying to find an assistant that would work for you.Only a few students would actually want to be assigned a new professor as a supervisor, so compared to veteran professors, there wasn\u2019t a lot of willing manpower.For Cleoh, Anise was a student that she was grateful for. She had a gentle personality, a neat way of taking care of things, and was a model student who didn\u2019t judge a professor by their experience, respecting them all equally.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything else from the school\u2019s inspection department?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct. If you need anything else, please feel free to call me any time.\u201dWith a bright smile, she waved to Anise as she took her leave. Anyway, Assistant Professor Cleoh was also a professor, so she had to maintain at least some level of respect towards her.Though in fact, Cleoh was often perceived as a close sister rather than a dignified professor. But with that said, there was no way for her to actually be that close to a student.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dCleoh dropped her head on top of the piles of paper again. There were more files than she had expected regarding the Occupation of Ophelis Hall incident. She read through them carefully, but she still couldn\u2019t get rid of that uneasy feeling.From the perspective of being the youngest professor, who was in charge of all sorts of chores, she thought about doing things half-heartedly\u2026 Though at the end of the day, some part of her had an uneasy suspicion that kept on bothering her.For some reason, it didn\u2019t feel like everything had been completely figured out.Checking Elris\u2019 records, sorting out the incident by time, and then checking the witness testimonies\u2026The story itself came together well, but why did it still feel like some piece of the puzzle was missing?\u201cIn the first place, just how much do I need to worry about coming to a proper conclusion\u2026? I\u2019m so tired that I feel like I\u2019m going to die\u2026\u201dIt was just a regular chore that Professor Glast had left behind, so why couldn\u2019t she just finish it up roughly, report back to Professor Glast, and be done with it.She kept on thinking about it, but in the end Cleoh had a personality where she couldn\u2019t finish things half-heartedly.\u201cHmmm\u2026 Hmm\u2026\u201dShe kept looking at the files while worrying about that sense of discomfort. It was like she could feel the presence of a black curtain that hadn\u2019t been revealed yet\u2026 Was that just an overreaction? Did she read too many novels full of conspiracy theories?Even then\u2026 If she felt that something was off, it was still better to solve it to the end.Cleoh thought it would be best to meet with the \u2018Additional Investigation Subjects\u2019 listed in the file and hear their side of the story.Ed, Yennekar, and Ziggs.She wondered if there really was a black curtain behind this entire incident, but\u2026 there was no harm in being extra careful.\u201cYennekar and Ziggs are quite famous, so I get that. But Ed\u2026 Ed\u2026 I feel like I've heard that name often before\u2026\u201dThen she remembered his full name, the one that he was no longer referred to by. Ed Rothstaylor.A descendant of the Rothstaylor family, who was now an excommunicated fallen aristocrat.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCleoh quietly looked down at the files, stroking her chin. Though she couldn't see it\u2026 It felt like\u2026 The bottom of the iceberg was\u00a0right there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Anyone Can Be a Professor (2)\u201cOh my! I\u2019m so sorry, Ed.\u201dThe morning of the second day, I went out to the commercial district for the weekend. Cutting through the crowded commercial district to the southwest, I went all the way over to Mexes Bridge. It was one of the two bridges that led outside Acken Island. It felt like I had walked nearly two hours to get there.When I entered Elte Company\u2019s Silvenia Branch\u2014which could be clearly seen after passing over the bridge\u2014the staff led me to a sitting room, as if they had been waiting for me. It was uncomfortable to see them act so oddly polite towards me.Lortel, who was sitting quietly in the room waiting for me, apologized and explained that she had forgotten to prepare the contract that she promised.\u201cEven though I made a promise to you and made you come all the way out here, these days I've just been so busy that I didn\u2019t have time to prepare it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m really sorry. Maybe it would be a better idea to come back sometime next week, instead. Though as an apology, I prepared some tea and other refreshments for you. Also, there were a few magically engineered items that were left off the ledger. On your way out, please pick them up at the counter.\u201dLortel was acting very differently from her time at the Teacher District.Instead of her usual school uniform and robe, she was now wearing a long, flared skirt, a white blouse, and a beret with a fancy golden frame.When I caught up with her after the last incident, the only looks I\u2019d seen of hers were drenched wet from the rain and her wearing that tattered robe. It was quite a new look from what I\u2019d seen before.It was too luxurious to be considered a casual outfit, so I asked her if she had some sort of appointment to attend to.\u201cI have a very important appointment later today, so I dressed up. How do I look?\u201dShe asked this with a bright smile.\u201cAn important appointment?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dPerhaps she didn\u2019t want to answer, as she responded with a smile instead. I nodded my head in response.I sat in the seat across from her in that luxurious room as I brought up my main question.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you about something. Do you also happen to deal with furniture?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to buy some cheap but decent furniture, but all the products here at the branch are a bit too high class. Could you perhaps prepare something like a simple desk, chair, or cabinet? Something that would be good enough for me?\u201d\u201cOh! Since you're asking for that, you must have finished the cabin.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost done. I just need to finish the details and it will be complete.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 As you know, here there is quite a high demand for products that are of an aristocrat\u2019s level. That\u2019s why products that tend to focus on practicality and a cheap price aren\u2019t ordered. I should be able to arrange it myself, but it might take a bit of time.\u201dLortel put her hand on her chin as she fell into a deep thought. Suddenly, she started to grin.\u201cIt would be a bit of an issue if I were to give something away for free. As I told you before, giving away something for free wouldn\u2019t be right, considering the ethics that come with being a merchant. Plus, all the other merchants would end up looking down on me.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing that can be done about that.\u201d\u201cWell, there is somewhat of an intuitive method to get around that.\u201dLortel stood up from the sofa in the room and walked over to her work desk. Then, as she gathered magic power into her hands\u2026Crack!\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWoodworking is your specialty, right? If you reconnect the leg that broke off, you can use it again. For me, it\u2019s already trash. As such, I have no use for it any longer. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just have to throw it out.\u201dIt was a chair engraved with a fancy deer pattern and an eye catching, luxurious gold frame.\u201cHow much was that chair?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if it could be called passion, or if she just got caught up in the momentum. Either way, she was a girl that was full of spirit, who did what she wanted.Lortel\u2019s gaze left the chair as it began to move to the cabinets, windows, and so on. I couldn\u2019t even carry it all in the first place, so I tried to stop her.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll send you these trivial pieces of \u2018trash\u2019 later.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Okay.\u201d\u201cAnyway, there is something that I wanted to say to you.\u201dLortel returned to the sofa and sat down, taking a sip of tea from her cup. It looked like she was trying to act elegant, but when compared to the way she had just smashed that chair, the gap was only growing.\u201cDo you know the assistant professor, Cleoh? Cleoh Elpin?\u201d\u201cHm? Yeah.\u201d\u201cHer behavior is quite unusual\u2026 So, I've been trying to keep my eye on her recently. Well, she\u2019s still a very childlike person, so it\u2019s probably not particularly dangerous\u2026 But still\u2026\u201dCleoh Elpin.She was a young woman appointed as an assistant professor for that very year. She was also one of Professor Glast\u2019s best students, who had been dealing with him for nearly ten years.From what I recalled, she appeared in the final chapter of Act 2 as the second phase boss in the Glast Subjugation\u2026 It was about time for her to start showing up in the storyline.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 She\u2019s strangely intuitive and happens to oversee the school\u2019s report on the occupation of Ophelis Hall. Well, I\u2019ll take care of it myself, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it\u2026 I just thought I should tell you.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201dAfter responding, I took a sip of the tea. Lortel looked at me strangely.I looked back at her, wondering if she had anything else to say. Lortel cleared her throat, stood up, and then began walking towards me.Sitting down on the table, she leaned her head towards me.\u201cHow do you manage to never change your expression? That\u2019s quite a winning move on its own.\u201dSeeing that she clearly looked upset, I immediately realized what it was about.It was about what had happened when we said goodbye to each other\u2026 Right before she took the torch.\u201cIn the first place, Ed\u2026 You don\u2019t even see me as a woman, do you?\u201dLortel bounced her foot as she twirled her finger on the table.\u201cWell, what\u2019s the point of me trying to twist my words? Ed, I see you as a man. It\u2019s exactly as you think. Everything that I asked of you was because of my hidden intentions.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know what you want me to say, but\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t expect you to answer. As you know, I never take a fight that I don\u2019t have a high chance of winning.\u201dLortel let out a deep sigh as she pressed her hand against my chest.\u201cI know exactly what you would say if you were to give me an answer now. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll only take a bet when my victory is guaranteed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter all, merchants are people that fight to win. Right now, you may feel lukewarm about it all, but\u2026 Who knows what will happen in the future?\u201dLortel smiled as she talked in a collected manner.\u201cI\u2019m not the only one here who\u2019s a bit nervous, am I?\u201dIf you looked closely, you could see Lortel\u2019s fingertips trembling.Her charming smile was the same as always. Regardless of whether she was guaranteed victory, or instead pushed into a corner.It was the characteristic of a merchant who would never let their secrets be betrayed by their own body.* * *You have acquired the advanced production skill \u2018Magic Engineering.\u2019One Advanced Production Technique Slot has been used.There was a marble that would fit in the palm of my hand, as well as a stand to hold it up. The structure of these magically engineered items was much simpler than I thought, so I could analyze them quickly.The strange sense of accomplishment that came from finally learning an advanced skill tickled my heart.I thought it would be a good idea to organize the rest of the magically engineered items in the hut, so I walked through the camp full of items.After the sun went down, a chill started to fill in the air. It was autumn.When I started living in the forest, it was still only early spring. Because of that, I had put aside taking measures against the cold and instead focused on securing food, clothing, and shelter.However, with the colors of the leaves beginning to change, the chill in the air was something I couldn\u2019t ignore.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe time had come that I really couldn\u2019t sleep outdoors any longer.In addition to that, when winter came and the snow started to pile up, it would become increasingly more difficult to hunt animals and gather meat in the forest. Plus, the number of edible plants that were available also became a problem, meaning that finding food that I could eat would be a major problem.I had to prepare for winter.A cozy atmosphere coming from the falling snow\u2026 The warm romance that I usually associated with winter was beautiful only because it took place in a sturdy home, with food in the refrigerator. That wasn\u2019t the case where I was.Still, my situation wasn\u2019t all that desperate. That was because I had money.\u201cEighteen\u2026 Nineteen\u2026 Twenty.\u201dI opened the leather bag that Lortel handed me. It was filled with twenty shiny gold coins.If I were ever pushed to such extremes, I could always spend a bit of money. However, I couldn\u2019t waste it. I needed to set a policy to minimize expenditure on one-time use goods.For the current semester, I could survive off the scholarship provided by the Glockt Scholarship Foundation. However, from next semester\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what would happen. I needed to spend my money effectively to be able to pay the tuition fees each semester.It was obvious that Lortel liked me. However, relying on her goodwill because of that fact would be too unsafe of a plan. Even if something were to happen between us, it would have to happen after the storyline was complete. It would be impossible for it to happen before then.It would be a bad idea to try to calculate and take advantage of other people\u2019s goodwill\u2026 I wasn\u2019t just saying that because it was the right thing to do, either.If I got too close to a main character in the storyline, then it would break my policy. But if I was willing to give up on that policy\u2026 Well, a human\u2019s mind was like a reed, so you never knew when it would easily change.Being self-sufficient was the core of survival. It would be an extremely dangerous decision to give up control of my own life to temporarily rely on another's goodwill. No matter what anyone said, I had to take responsibility for my own life.Though, I\u00a0was\u00a0willing to spend some money on reinforcing the cabin and preparing some decent woodworking tools.That was because they were items that I needed to keep using in the future and would help me improve my daily life skills immediately.But I couldn\u2019t spend too much money on food or firewood. Maybe it would be fine to spend some money on spices and oil, but I could never spend any money on items that could be procured from the forest.\u201cIgnite.\u201dCasting \u2018Ignite\u2019 to light the fireplace had become as easy as breathing.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *Fwoosh.The fire burned in the decently made fireplace, and the smoke went up the chimney that took two days to complete.The fireplace itself was also larger than I thought, as it took up almost two thirds of the wall.The reason that it ended up bigger than my original design was to make a bigger fire\u2026 In other words, it was to increase the firepower. Though it was more like a fire oven rather than a fireplace at that point.The firewood itself could be procured easily, so I made the choice to focus on firepower first\u2026 Thanks to that, the chimney also had to be bigger to release the smoke. It was all a pain in the ass.Crackle, Crackle.The sound of burning firewood echoed faintly inside the cabin.It wasn\u2019t even early evening yet, but the inside of the cabin was already very dark. The warm light from the fire filled the inside. It was quite bright and made me feel good.I stared blankly at the burning flames for about five minutes, before sitting down and leaning against the cabin wall.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dSitting down against the wall, I let out a deep sigh before laughing. I felt satisfied.The idea of \u2018warming up\u2019 while doing outdoor camp related activities was nearly impossible.Warmth wasn\u2019t something that I had particularly sought, but once I laid down it had become something that I had gotten addicted to. It made me move closer to the fire.I have a roof and a ceiling.The walls and roof were covered with mud, and the floor was covered in leather.Both materials retained heat well, so once they started to heat up, they wouldn\u2019t get cold again easily. Once the air was heated, that warm feeling would spread throughout the cabin.The problem was that the fuel efficiency was not as good as I had thought it would be\u2026 There seemed to be no other solution than to spend more time gathering firewood. If I didn\u2019t have enough time, I wouldn\u2019t have any choice but to use magic to cut down the trees. It wasn\u2019t too hard to start a fire since I can just use \u2018Ignite\u2019, so I didn\u2019t think it was all that much of a pain.As expected\u2026 I thought there needed to be some way to increase my magic power efficiency.I still had to prepare more firewood, but I was finally moving into the cabin. Once I got some furniture, my safe living environment would finally be complete.The warm air pressed against the side of my face.It felt like heaven. I was so relieved, as if I had lifted a heavy burden off my chest.\u201c\u2026 How long has it been already? I should go and check the traps.\u201dI had recently begun installing not just traps for small animals, but also ones for larger animals.I really hoped there would be a good harvest.* * *\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, it may very well be true.\u201dAssistant Professor Cleoh presented her opinion that there still seemed to be something missing regarding the Occupation of Ophelis Hall incident.With that said, Professor Glast neither confirmed nor denied the possibility. Though, he didn\u2019t seem to have much interest in the first place.\u201cAssistant Professor Cleoh, strangely enough you have a really good sense of intuition. Sometimes, you even produce very plausible hypotheses with it. However, you also tend to make poor decisions when it comes to important things. With that said, please refrain from being overconfident in your judgment when time is crucial.\u201d\u201cThe way he said that was too much. Right? Hm?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTrix Hall Student Counseling OfficeWith a desk between them, Assistant Professor Cleoh and Ziggs Eiffelstein were facing each other.\u201cI-I see.\u201d\u201cListen to me, Ziggs. You should also know, as you take Professor Glast\u2019s class, but why does he always have to act like that? I've been his pupil for nearly ten years already, and I\u2019m struggling with a mountain load of work, but still! Is giving just one or two words of encouragement that difficult?\u201dResponding carefully to her questions, Ziggs was sweating up a storm.Cleoh, who was the faculty member in charge of the Occupation of Ophelis Hall investigation, had a strange feeling while reading the files regarding it. Thus, she decided to conduct a further, independent, investigation.The school\u2019s investigation office had not yet thought to place Ed, Ziggs, and Yennekar under investigation.The first one up was Ziggs, who was called to Trix Hall. But rather than a hearing or investigation, it ended up becoming more of a lament.At first, it was a conversation between the two. They spoke with a sense of dignity, but at some point, she started speaking informally and letting out deep sighs.It was obvious that, if her assistant Anise or the other students responsible for helping her saw that scene, they would only cover their faces in disappointment as they let out a deep sigh.\u201cOh geez, this is not the time to be doing this. Ziggs, since you have a reliable image, I just ended up complaining to you without realizing it.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m flattered to hear that.\u201d\u201cSo, I have this strange feeling about everything. Right now, it\u2019s probably just that I\u2019m just misunderstanding it all\u2026 But there were a couple of eyewitness testimonies that claimed that they had seen the Golden King Elte at the scene\u2026 Plus, the motivation behind Elris\u2019 actions doesn\u2019t seem to hold up. Well, she did admit to everything, so it seems like there isn\u2019t much room for any further investigation\u2026\u201dZiggs gulped, his mouth drying out.Assistant Professor Cleoh was a seemingly childish idiot. He wondered if people like that should really be teachers in the first place.He realized that the amount of academic knowledge someone had, and their ability to think logically, were completely different things.The results from her thesis and academic research were certainly amazing, but\u2026 She seemed to have a screw loose that made him wonder if it was even okay for her to be like that.However, there were many times where her strange sense of intuition seemed to see through everything.\u201cDon\u2019t you think there might be some kind of black curtain that we can\u2019t see behind it all?\u201d\u201cF-For Example?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 Like, you know the Golden King Elte\u2026 His daughter lives in Ophelis Hall. I mean Lortel.\u201dThose words made Ziggs\u2019 breath catch.\u201cHowever, I\u2019ve already received testimonies that Lortel was being held captive by Elris when Taylee and his party went to defeat her. At least, I think so? Anyway, after that she supposedly ran from Ophelis Hall, and her whereabouts from there were\u2026 Well, nobody knows where she went.\u201d\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no way that Lortel would be such a bad girl! Her grades are good, and her personality is so pleasant! Last time, she brought me a whole bunch of tarts to cheer me up since I was working overtime.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAssistant Professor Cleoh said all of that while smiling brightly. Then, she quietly lowered her voice as she continued to talk.\u201cI believe that Ed Rothstaylor is a bit suspicious, though. The one that has been excommunicated.\u201dIt was weird to see her whispering quietly like that, as if anyone would be listening. In the first place, only Ziggs and Cleoh were there.The name was so unexpected that Ziggs\u2019 expression turned rather stiff.\u201cMy upperclassmen, Ed?\u201d\u201cYeah. It may just sound like some conspiracy, but hear me out, Ziggs.\u201dIn the first place, Ziggs was only called over for questioning. Why did he have to listen to such a story?It was such a strange thing for the assistant professor to do, but Ziggs couldn\u2019t reject her.\u201cEveryone else at the scene were either students living in Ophelis Hall or people that were involved with it. Basically, people that had no choice but to get caught up in the whole incident. But Taylee and Ed were the only two involved that had no connection with Ophelis Hall. It was clear that Taylee was brought along because of Elvira, and he was also part of the party that helped solve the issue, so he should be excluded from the list of suspects. But the other person is Ed. Just what was Ed doing at Ophelis Hall at that time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Ed was the black curtain behind this whole incident! They always say that the criminal goes back to the scene of the crime!\u201dSeeing her make a \u2018Ta-Da\u2019 sound effect with her mouth, acting as if she was proud of her deduction, made it clear that she was just a child-like idiot.\u201cTh-then wouldn\u2019t there be some sort of reason behind his actions? Wouldn\u2019t there need to be some sort of benefit for Ed for him to do such a thing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to figure that out! I\u2019m going to go ask Ed himself!\u201d\u201cIdentifying the culprit, then figuring out their motive and method\u2026 Isn\u2019t the order usually the opposite?\u201d\u201cOne method to find the answer is to take a look at it in the opposite direction, Ziggs.\u201dCleoh\u2019s gut feeling was lasting for more than just a day or two. Thus, Ziggs started to worry that Ed might get caught up in all that trouble soon.\u201cWell, Ziggs. You don\u2019t look all that suspicious, and you also don\u2019t know much about the situation, so I\u2019ll just let you go.\u201d\u201cThen are you going to go and call Ed to Trix Hall for further investigation?\u201d\u201cNo. If he has time to prepare a bunch of excuses, he will just slip away like an eel. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to hit him from the side.\u201dThat meant that Ziggs\u2019 plan to give Ed an early warning went down the drain.\u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gone off to live since leaving the dormitory\u2026 Though, he\u2019s apparently been seen around the northern forest quite a bit. I\u2019ll head over there and question him myself.\u201d* * *If you decided to take action, you needed to do it with momentum. That was Cleoh\u2019s policy.She was busy writing out research proposals whenever there was time, checking over the next week\u2019s course materials, and reading over student suggestions. Because of that, she was constantly busy out of her mind\u2026 But once she was given a job, she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to do it half-heartedly.She was planning to search through the northern forest before the sun went down, but she ended up having to do more work than expected, so the forest had already become very dark.\u2018Hmm\u2026 I guess I should have just come tomorrow. But other than the weekend, I don\u2019t have much free time.\u2019The atmosphere of the forest, which was gradually getting swallowed by the darkness, was as dreary as always. She couldn\u2019t see that far ahead of her, so searching wouldn\u2019t be all that effective.In the first place, Ed was unlikely to be walking around through the forest in the dark. Unless he was eating and sleeping out in the forest, what would be the point of going out in the middle of the night?She decided to just return when it was light out. It was at that moment, just as Cleoh made up her mind and started to turn around, that she heard it.Swish, Swish.At the sound of the grass moving over by the trail, Cleoh held her breath as she quickly hid behind some nearby trees.She stuck her head out, wondering if it was perhaps a wild animal that was just walking through the forest, but it ended up being Ed. The fallen aristocrat, surrounded by rumors\u2026On one side, he was holding the body of a bloody baby deer under his arm.And on his other shoulder\u2026 He was holding an unconscious human body.\u2018What\u2026? What is that\u2026?!\u2019Huffff, Huffff\u2026Ed breathing made it sound as if he was completely exhausted, resembling that of a wild animal. His eyes also seemed to shine in the dark.Cleoh gasped in pure astonishment.She was sure that the person that boy was carrying on his shoulder was\u2026 Someone that even Professor Glast praised as a rare genius. Lucy Mayreel.She seemed to have no intention of resisting while she was carried by that boy. She looked completely defeated.\u2018Lucy\u2026 That student is definitely Lucy\u2026!\u2019There was not a single person amongst the school's faculty that didn\u2019t know her name.Even the principal of the academy, Obel\u2014who was comparable to the archmage Glockt, who had helped found Silvenia\u2014had to do his best when it came to dealing with Lucy.That was Lucy Mayreel. A girl that was born with such an unfathomable amount of talent.Seeing such a girl subdued, being carried on his shoulder\u2026 Cleoh stared blankly at them as they started to disappear into the forest.Cleoh didn\u2019t even think about jumping out from where she was.She thought that she needed to dig a bit more into everything first. Also, as expected, her intuition wasn\u2019t wrong.\u2018I\u2026 I really may have been gifted with the talent of a detective\u2026!\u2019Even Professor Glast might be completely surprised by the piece of information that she intended to bring back.Cleoh followed Ed\u2019s footsteps, her eyes shining bright.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Anyone Can be a Professor (3)Late at night, the northern forest\u2019s darkness wasn\u2019t kind to intruders.For those who called the forest their home, such as the wild animals that played around or Ed\u2014who treated it like his front yard\u2014it might be a familiar space. For Cleoh, however, it was too foreign.Every time she accidentally stumbled or heard the occasional rustling sound from the grass, Cleoh would be frightened to death. However, she continued to patiently follow Ed.Eventually, Ed\u2019s camp appeared at the end of the trail.No, the size of it was too large to be called a mere camp. At that point, you could even consider it a hideout.\u201cWh-What the heck is all of this\u2026?!\u201dSmoke was coming out of the cabin\u2019s chimney, which really helped complete its look.The campfire settled at the space in front of the cabin had a smoker, drying rack, workstation, toolbox, and other equipment laid out all around it. On the other side, there was a wooden shelter that looked quite durable.On the right side of the cabin there was a tree with a hammock made of netting hung on it, as well as piled up firewood stored in a simple storage space made of nails and plywood. There were also pieces of timber, cut to the appropriate size, leaning against the wall of the cabin.The smell of it all was reminiscent of normal daily life too much to call it\u2026 a hideout. Cleoh was in utter shock as she hid behind a tree.Ed dropped off the baby deer\u2019s body near the campfire before he then roughly tossed Lucy into the wooden shelter. He then fixed her rolled-up skirt and threw a leather bag containing some jerky near her as he sat down near the fire, trimming some pieces of wood.\u2018Did she faint\u2026?\u2019No matter how lazy Lucy might be, there\u2019s no way that she would be sleeping in that kind of situation\u2026!Cleoh didn\u2019t realize Lucy\u2019s true ability to sleep, even in such a situation.On the surface, it looked as if she had been knocked out, kidnapped, and then dragged to his hideout.\u2018He managed to defeat Lucy\u2026?\u2019Completely unconscious, Lucy was laying in the corner of the shelter, not moving an inch.\u201c\u2026Ah, come to think of it\u2026 I have plans early tomorrow morning.\u201dSuddenly Ed started talking to himself with a soft voice.\u201c\u2026 Uh, I have so much work to take care of. Still, I should go to bed early today for my health. Hm\u2026\u201dEd quickly muttered to himself as he finished what he was working on. Then he put out the fire.All that was left was burning embers in the darkness of the front of his cabin.Ed picked up pieces of cloth for a blanket and went into the cabin.A subtle flame lit up the window, where there still wasn\u2019t any glass. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine Ed laying down inside the cabin near the fire.\u2018I need to save Lucy\u2026!\u2019She didn\u2019t know the exact circumstance, but after witnessing her being taken away like that, she couldn't leave Lucy alone.No matter how you looked at it, Cleoh was a member of the faculty. Practical combat magic wasn\u2019t her major, but a mere student would be no match for her.But she still couldn\u2019t let her guard down. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for someone who had a weak body like Cleoh to try to physically attack Ed. Aside from that\u2026 She didn\u2019t know what kind of secret weapons he could be hiding that allowed him to defeat Lucy.It was best to approach the camp as carefully as possible, and quickly escape carrying the unconscious Lucy.You could tell just from her appearance that Lucy was light as a feather. Even without blatantly using magic power, Cleoh should still be able to drag her out of the camp by herself.Cleoh slowly approached the camp, swallowing hard and bending down.She was nervous, not knowing when the cabin door would open or when Ed would pop out.In order to respond to any unexpected situations, she focused everything on her magic power resonance.Holding her breath and slowly moving towards the wooden shelter, she saw Lucy laying on her stomach exhaling like a baby.\u2018Slowly\u2026 As quietly as possible\u2026!\u2019The moment she crouched and placed her hand on Lucy\u2026Whoosh!Thud!It all happened in a blink of an eye.Lucy suddenly opened her eyes, quickly gathering magic power as she blew away Cleoh\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat?!\u201dCleo let out a short scream in shock.Lucy was also startled, holding onto her witch\u2019s hat as she ran towards the fire.She looked down at Cleo with cold eyes.It was clear that day that it wasn\u2019t a friendly look.\u201cL\u2026 Lucy\u2026?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dGoing off the metaphor that Lucy was like a stray cat, in that same aspect she was someone that didn\u2019t take kindly to strangers.Cats had a keen sense, which closely resembled that of a wild animal. No matter how deeply asleep they may be, they were quick to recognize contact with someone not granted permission to touch.However, it was too much for her to not recognize the fact of the assistant professor Cleoh, who was one of the faculty members in charge of her year. That was because Lucy lived by the beat of her own drum.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026 Lucy\u2026!\u201dBefore Cleoh could continue speaking, Lucy did as she always did and quick disappeared, taking the bag of jerky from the wooden shelter with her.She was so quick that, by the time Cleoh came to her senses, all that was left was a few stray leaves in the place where Lucy disappeared from.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dOnce again silence fell over the entire camp.\u2018\u2026 First, let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019It didn't seem like Ed had noticed Cleoh\u2019s presence yet. She didn\u2019t have any clue about what was going on, but it seemed clear enough that Ed was suspicious and that was all she needed to know.\u2018I'm sure that I\u2019ve found some sort of clue. The next thing to do is to question Ed once I\u2019ve gathered some solid evidence.\u2019\u2018Until then, I need to slowly and carefully figure out the main point of all of this.\u2019Cleoh organized her thoughts, nodding her head.\u2018Anyway\u2026 There\u2019s not a single person that knows that I was here in this forest, other than Lucy! In the meantime, nobody will know!\u2019* * *The morning of the following day.\u201cI heard that the assistant professor Cleoh entered the northern forest yesterday. Did you see her, Ed?\u201d\u201cHm? Really? I didn\u2019t see her.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201dI met with Yennekar in front of the student square quite early.The wooden benches placed around the magnificent looking fountain were completely empty. It was still early enough for the fog to be lingering around.It was about the time where the other students would still be waking up, rubbing their eyes, and getting ready to start their day.\u201cWhy did she stop by the northern forest? Did you hear anything else about it, Yennekar?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I only heard it from someone else, so\u2026\u201dI felt quite nervous hearing her name. Cleoh.Although she wasn\u2019t a super influential character, she did have a role in the storyline. And she was the type who wandered off because of her keen sense of curiosity.From what I had seen of her during the second phase of the Glast Subjugation\u2026 It was certainly nothing more or less than absurd. Her difficulty as a boss was so easy that you could practically walk past her.However, what\u00a0was\u00a0important\u2026 She had an active role in Professor\u2019s Glast\u2019s theft of the Sage\u2019s Seal.Assistant Professor Cleoh wasn\u2019t a morally flawed professor, and in the first place she was just someone that was sick of Professor Glast.That was why it was surprising that, without being blackmailed or tricked, she was willing to agree with Professor Glast\u2019s plan.According to the original timeline, it was explained that she had just followed the instructions of her advisor\u2026 But that reasoning seemed too weak.\u201cWell, maybe the school just sent her to take care of some random job? I was just worried that she might have gone to bother you about living in the forest.\u201d\u201cIn the first place, the forest is a bit too much for the school to manage on their own. It's pretty much always left unattended\u2026 So long as I don\u2019t do anything to stand out, I should be fine.\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201dYennekar smiled as she nodded her head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you out so early in the morning, Ed. Clara and Anise have been telling me to stop staying out so late at night\u2026 I\u2019ve been getting back to Dex Hall past curfew recently, so I\u2019ve gotten scolded quite a bit.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Well, the camp and Dex Hall are quite far away from each other. It must have been hard for you to keep visiting the forest.\u201d\u201cY-You know, Ed\u2026\u201dYennekar suddenly lowered her head in embarrassment, and her bangs started to cover her face as she spoke shyly.\u201cY-You know how I visit you at the camp everyday\u2026> Can you keep it as a secret from others as much as possible\u2026?\u201d\u201cHm? Do I have to?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 How should I say it\u2026? It\u2019s embarrassing for me to say this aloud\u2026 But I have a lot of friends.\u201dIt was obvious she would be embarrassed to say that.Yennekar was the hope of the second years, and the top of her class. It must have been tiring for her to keep greeting every single person she met, one by one, as she walked around campus.\u201cSince it\u2019s your house and all, I would feel sorry for you if it started getting too crowded because of me. Heh.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s just keep it to ourselves, hm? What\u2019s the point of having more people show up at your camp?\u201dThinking about it, for someone like Yennekar\u2014who was born with a deep sense of sincerity\u2014all the people constantly looking at her must be burdensome.She was apologizing to me, but she actually just needed her own place to rest.\u201cI still don\u2019t think people view me all that highly here in school in the first place\u2026 So, it shouldn\u2019t be something that you need to worry about too much.\u201d\u201cBut these days there are less bad rumors about you. Since you\u2019ve just been quietly taking care of your own work, and since you did all sorts of other things to help people, too.\u201dYennekar pulled the shawl around her shoulder as she stumbled over her words, coming back to her senses.\u201cAnyway! The main point! Main Point! The reason we agreed to meet today!\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dYennekar put her oak wand off to one side of the bench as she opened her hands.The magic power energy swirled around as small sparks burst from her hand.The burning flame slowly changed its shape, resembling a bat.It then flew from her hands, sitting on Yennekar\u2019s shoulder as it folded its wings and took a stance.\u201cThis is the low-ranking fire spirit, Mugg. Do you want to try focusing your magic power to communicate with him?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI gently closed my eyes. A moment later, I opened them once more, looking at that fire bat. Soon enough, I started to hear a voice in my ear.[Nice to meet you, young master Ed! I am the low-ranking fire spirit, Mugg! It has already been four years since I grew from being a mere fluid spirit! The previous people I made contracts with include young master Roden of Schnen, young master Kuru of the Samal province, and it is now my honor to also be with Lady Yennekar!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[At last week\u2019s regular report meeting, we went over the election for young master Ed\u2019s contract with a spirit. I passed the first round of screening, second and third round of interviews, and finally the fourth round of discussions with the other spirits. Thus, I have qualified to be the spirit that will make a contract with you! I am confident in the fact that I have the best efficiency when it comes to magic power in the northern forest, and I have the best communication skills amongst the other low-ranking spirits!]After saying all of that, he lifted his head up 45 degrees to look at me, stiff as a rock and not moving a muscle.Just what kind of military training did he go through to act like that\u2026?\u201cYennekar\u2026. Uhm\u2026\u201d\u201cHm? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dI couldn\u2019t seriously ask Yennekar, who was grinning like an idiot, if he always acted like that.Yennekar was someone who knew a ridiculous number of spirits. That was why I asked her to introduce me to a decent spirit, one that I could make a contract with. I knew that I wasn\u2019t in a position to complain, but\u2026\u201cSince you asked me to introduce you to a good spirit, I picked one of the spirits I previously made a contract with. He is also efficient when it comes to magic power. The process of picking them was\u2026 Well, it was quite the process, but Takan took care of it all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, Takan said\u2026 He\u2019d \u2018deal with it\u2019 himself\u2026\u201d[It is an honor to be able to make a contract with you, young master Ed! My heart is burning with passion! Well, my body is already on fire, but I promise to burn with even more determination to support you fully!]Was it the second or third time I played \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019 that I leveled up my spirit-type skills?Among the spirits I made a contract with that time, there was the water spirit Cleo and the wind spirit Pesci.Back then, I\u2019m sure there wasn\u2019t this type of feeling though\u2026?Laughing together, exchanging jokes, giving each other support during battle, and manifesting them to fall asleep on top of their fur\u2026 It was definitely the feeling of having a close companion.[Just give me the order!]\u2026\u2026Well, I had nothing to say about the elite amongst the lower-ranking spirits.[Magic Skills Details]Grade: Proficient MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:Fast Casting Lvl 8Mana Sense Lvl 8Fire Element Magic:Ignite Lvl 14Wind Element Magic:Wind Blade Lvl 13<Intermediate Magic can now be learned!>Spirit-type Magic:Spiritual Resonance Lvl 12Spiritual Understanding Lvl 12Spirit Manifestation Lvl 1Sense Sharing Lvl 1<Spirit Slot: Lower-ranking Fire Spirit Mugg>Resonance Level: 2Spiritual Efficiency: GoodInnate Skills:Blessing of Fire Fortune (Temporary immunity to fire)Explosion (Low-level Explosion)Increased fire-type magic ability<New Spirit Slot: Empty>\u201c\u2026Oh? It\u2019s warm?\u201d\u201cYou can feel the heat, right? When you start to resonate with a spirit you are contracted with, even without manifesting them you can feel the physical or magic power of that spirit. If you resonate too strongly, you will start to get hot. So please make sure you control it well.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take much time to complete the contract with Mugg. With just a small magic circle, I was able to make a contract with the low-ranking spirit.Mugg sat down on my shoulder, which ended up startling me because of the faint heat.\u201cTh-Then if I control my level of resonance\u2026 The \u2018firepower\u2019 will change, too\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sort of strange to be calling it \u2018firepower\u2019, as that\u2019s more of a mechanical device\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 This is\u2026\u201dOnly then did I lift up Mugg with a bright face.[Hahaha. I\u2019m embarrassed, young master Ed.]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *It was a portable stove\u2026!The long,\u00a0long\u00a0winter\u2026 He was something to stick onto my body that released warmth, whether I was inside or outside the cabin\u2026 A tool for survival. Something more important than I could put into words\u2026!Plus\u2026 He didn\u2019t even use any firewood\u2026!Of course, he instead ate away at my magic power. But due to my spiritual resonance, the mana efficiency of the spirit's flames compared to the amount of magic power I use to cast \u2018Ignite\u2019 was like heaven and earth.Spiritual Resonance was the level of efficiency in terms of mana power when communicating with a spirit or manifesting them.The higher level your Spiritual Resonance was, the less magic power you needed to deal with stronger or more spirits. No matter how inherently cursed you were when it came to the amount of mana you could store, if your resonance was high you could deal with a wider range of different spirits.Due to its unique characteristic, mana efficiency was completely different from general magic. That was the greatest strength of Elementalists.Of course, it wasn\u2019t like it didn\u2019t consume any magic power at all. You couldn\u2019t keep it running all day long like a boiler. But I could still use it when I was working outdoors in the frigid winter, or when I needed to stay inside the cabin before it was heated.When I was running low on firewood, I could use the fire bat with magic power instead\u2026 That meant that I could be flexible and constantly switch between firewood and magic power whenever needed.\u201c\u2026Thank you, Yennekar! I love it so much! Let\u2019s get along well from now on, heat\u2014\u2026 No, Mugg.\u201d[Hahahahaha! I don\u2019t know what to do with my body, seeing you act so happy!]I put Mugg into my hands, turning around excitedly.Making him fly into the air, I also checked the intensity of the heat by adjusting the level of resonance. Raising the resonance to the highest amount was enough to surpass the warmth of a campfire. Of course, doing so had a terrible level of magic power efficiency, but with my spirit-type skills\u2019 proficiency, growing it would only get easier.It\u2019s so different to actually experience a contract with a spirit when compared to seeing it in the game. Was it always possible to share this sense with a spirit you made a contract with?With half admiration and half pure excitement, I tested out all sorts of different things with Mugg.\u201cI\u2019m glad you look so happy, Ed. You always look so down, like you\u2019re going through a tough time. I\u2019m so happy to see you like this. Hehe.\u201dYennekar kept watching over us for a while, smiling bashfully.\u201cLet me know if you ever need anything else, Ed. Then, before my first class I\u2019ll teach you more about resonance and sense. After all, it'll be faster if you practice it with me. Also, so that you can quickly get up to a level where you can make a contract with a mid-ranking spirit, we should practice spiritual combat as well\u2026 I\u2019ll make some time and rent out a practice room! And\u2026 Uhm\u2026 There are a lot of different accessories that can help increase resonance efficiency\u2026 They\u2019re all in my room, so\u2026 the next time we meet, then. Hyug!\u201dYennekar, who had been talking excitedly, suddenly choked. It seemed like she had just thought of something.She quickly shut her mouth, before she let out a slow exhale and looked towards me.\u201cUhm, Ed\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cActually\u2026 I\u2019m busy! I\u2019m a busy person!\u201dYennekar straightened her back as she shut her eyes, clearing her throat.\u201cI\u2019m also the top student in our grade. So, there are all sorts of people that are waiting in line for me to teach them, you know? So\u2026 It\u2019ll be hard to make time! Hm!\u201d\u201cI see. Well, I guess that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too much for me to be teaching you spiritual magic\u2026? Hm?\u201dShe kept on grinning while saying that, though her lips were clearly trembling.It was\u2026 a kind of push and pull. I wondered if she was acting so differently from her normal self in an attempt to imitate Lortel\u2026 But then I realized that all of what she was saying was the truth.It was easy to forget, as she was spending her time back in the camp with me every day, but normally it would be fairly expensive and valuable to have an opportunity to have one-on-one lessons from an elementalist like Yennekar.\u2018It\u2019s so great having a valuable personal connection~\u2019 is what I had thought, all while giving nothing back to her\u2026 I was sure that I had crossed the line.\u201cI didn\u2019t think of that, Yennekar\u2026 Though, it\u2019s so obvious. I\u2019m really sorry. I took your goodwill for granted.\u201d\u201cUh, hm? No, I didn\u2019t mean for you to apologize like that\u2026 It\u2019s just that Clara keeps telling me\u2026 To try pushing you\u2026 No, never mind. That\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 What should I do\u2026? Isn\u2019t it only right for me to pay you back with money, for your time and sincerity? Though, I probably can\u2019t give you a suitable amount\u2026\u201dEven then, I was sure that it would be possible for her to give me a discount, since we were friends\u2026 Right? After all, Yennekar knew all about my situation.I had no choice but to whip out the calculator and check how much I could spend, while also considering my survival activities.\u201cWhat? Money?\u201dHearing that word, Yennekar was taken by surprise.\u201cMoney! What money?! Ed! You\u2019re in an urgent state, one where you must worry about surviving! How can you think of just wasting your money like that?! You need to save it all! Don\u2019t waste it! Don\u2019t even think about paying me, either! I\u2019ll get mad!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you brought up paying for this\u2026 That\u2019s too cold of you! We're closer than that! Seriously, you make me so upset!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you bring up the cost of it all in the first place?\u201dYennekar gasped, stunned by those words. Though it looked like she had realized that, thinking back on it\u2026 I was right.I had no idea how to guess the rhythm she wanted me to dance at.\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with you all of a sudden?\u201dThat was when Yennekar started to confess everything.\u201cIt was because Clara gave me some advice\u2026 I\u2019m someone that tends to be a bit too nice to others, giving things out too much\u2026 No, that\u2019s not! Hm\u2026 Uh\u2026 It\u2019s more like, I must work on raising the price for helping others, is what she said\u2026! Sort of like negotiating? Maybe a bit more chic? I need to know how to say \u2018no\u2019 when I mean it\u2026 I need to be a bit colder that way.\u201d\u201cNothing she said is wrong. I\u2019m also quite scared that one day you might get scammed by someone somewhere. You made quite a great friend.\u201d\u201cRight, I guess that\u2019s true\u2026? But\u2026 I\u2026 I just don\u2019t treat anyone like that\u2026\u201dWriggling her fingers and glancing at me from the side, she was surprised the moment our eyes met.\u201cAnyway! I\u2019ll go into more detail next time! Next time, I\u2019ll see you at the combat practice room! I\u2019ll make the reservation, then let you know! I\u2019ll bring a nice accessory, too! Also, let me know if you need a resonance textbook to practice! Since I have morning class soon, I\u2019ll get going\u2026! Bye, Ed! See you later!\u201dAnd with that, she jumped off the bench and ran away.I didn\u2019t have time to say anything back to her, so I was left with no choice but to watch as Yennekar ran away.* * *Rumor had it that the school\u2019s finances were in quite a tight spot.Professor Glast was quietly sitting in his laboratory, flipping through the pages of his academic books. Research regarding Celestial Magic was extremely limited, so barely any progress had been made at all.Regarding the study of Celestial Magic, which twisted and broke the rules and challenged the perceived truth\u2026 Barely any progress had been made since the work of the great sage Silvenia.It was hopeless for any scholar to try and study the Sage\u2019s Seal in the first place.If academic research was a field where only a few chosen geniuses could contribute, then was the role of a scholar such as himself only to remember and systemize the knowledge of his predecessor to pass onto future generations?Professor Glast let out a sly laugh, troubled over his old-fashioned way of thinking. He had realized that his life had become comfortable enough that his worries were nothing serious.In any case, Glast\u2019s role had become clear.In a world full of trash, he was going to be someone that would find a gem of a talent that would shine, changing the world forever.Such a brilliant talent would be capable of speeding up the progress of research, regardless of the field.Thud!Assistant professor Cleoh Elpin broke the silence, bursting into the laboratory.\u201cProfessor Glast!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to knock?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s urgent!\u201dCleoh went outside again, closing the door and knocking. Professor Glast let out a deep sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just come in.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dCleoh strode in, holding a bunch of files and a crystal ball. She dropped it all over Professor Glast\u2019s desk.\u201cI have something to report! This is a really big deal! Get ready to be surprised!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEd Rothstaylor! Do you know that student\u2014Ed, the one who was excommunicated?!?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t bother remembering the names of every piece of trash that doesn\u2019t have a drop of talent.\u201d\u201cThere you go again saying such a thing! Just hear me out first!\u201dCleoh kept on making a fuss, slamming on his desk.\u201cYou know Lucy, right?! Lucy! The one that you really adore, Lucy Mayreel!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLucy was defeated by Ed. To the point where she couldn\u2019t do anything?! No, what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 I was suspicious about the Occupation of Ophelis Hall incident, so I went to do some further investigating\u2026 No, even before that, I need to explain why I even went to the northern forest\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no point for you to keep rambling on, Assistant Professor Cleoh.\u201dShe had a lot of things that she wanted to say, but since she was so excited, she couldn\u2019t organize the story at all. Professor Glast let out a sigh, thinking that she must act the same way in front of her students.\u201cSo, what I mean is\u2026 I went around and ended up using the thoughtography recording magic back on the first floor of Ophelis Hall!\u201d\u201cThoughtography recording magic? Did you get permission from the school?\u201d\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t! I just went up to the department in charge of the magically engineered thoughtography equipment, made up an excuse, and I got my hands on it! Really, it\u2019s so great being a professor! They weren't even a bit suspicious of me when I did it! I couldn\u2019t even dream of doing this before I got my degree!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThoughtography Recording magic was a reenacting magic that allowed you to replay what happened in the past at a certain location.As it was magic that dealt with time, it consumed a great deal of magic power unless you used knowledge from Celestial Magic theory, which didn\u2019t have much research on it.Most of it was created by archmages that could create magically engineered items. Though, the price of just one of those items would be equivalent to the price of a building.The price was quite expensive, and the method to use it is complicated, so permission from the school was needed to officially use it. However, Cleoh used her authority as a teacher to exploit the equipment to her heart\u2019s content.It wasn\u2019t something that got worn out the more you used it. Though, it was a blatant abuse of power.\u201cJust get ready to write an apology.\u201d\u201cI already knew you would say that, so I filed it out in advance!\u201d\u201cIs that something to brag about?\u201d\u201cEven then, you\u2019ll take it into consideration with this! Here, take a look!\u201dCleoh filled the crystal ball with the thoughtography record.\u201cThe school\u2019s investigation department didn\u2019t even use Thoughtography recording magic at all during the investigation! I started to wonder why, but I guess that since the head maid Elris\u2019 confession was so clear, and the testimonies at the scene were all consistent, it just happened\u2026 In the first place, the Thoughtography recording magic doesn\u2019t record all that much!\u201dCleoh\u2018s mouth didn\u2019t stop moving as she pushed magic power into the crystal ball.\u201cSince it's a magically engineered piece of equipment that is complicated and difficult to set up and use, it would be too inefficient to set it up across Ophelis Hall. That\u2019s why I chose to not extend the investigation out that far! There was no need to! It was more valuable for me to just use it in one place, rather than the whole building!\u201d\u201cSo, what are you saying?\u201d\u201cJust in case\u2026 Following Taylee\u2019s testimony that he met Ed on the first floor, I only used it in the main hall on the first floor! The method to set it up was too complicated, so I just slapped it together!\u201dRegardless of if you were a faculty member, there was a limit to how much you could do. He was starting to get tired of Assistant Professor Cleoh\u2019s straightforward behavior every time she had a gut feeling.If Professor Glast had agreed that there might have been an issue, it would have been sent over to the disciplinary committee right away, but\u2026 Glast wasn\u2019t that type of person. There was also a shortage of people in the academy.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cLook at this! It caught Ed! I brought it over to you quickly since the image won\u2019t last long.\u201dThe scene was the moment Ed sat alone in the main hall of the first floor, greeting Taylee. At first glance, it seemed like a still picture, but you could tell it was clearly moving by the raindrops hitting the window.\u201cLook at this! He\u2019s just like a black curtain, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see the way he\u2019s sitting? He looks just like he\u2019s saying, \u2018I\u2019m the black curtain behind all of this\u2026\u2019, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dProfessor Glast ran his hand over his face as he looked straight at Assistant Professor Cleoh.\u201c\u2026 Is this everything?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI asked if this was all you brought in, seeing as you stomped in here and slammed the door.\u201d\u201cNo, uhm\u2026 I also told you how Ed was carrying around Lucy, who was completely knocked out\u2026\u201d\u201cLucy Mayreel is the type that is extremely lazy. She will fall asleep whenever there is time, and the moment she does, she won\u2019t wake up easily. Are you sure he wasn't just moving her somewhere else while she was sleeping?Unfortunately for her, that was what actually happened.\u201cBut when I approached her, she definitely had a big reaction\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t just you. That\u2019s Lucy\u2019s usual reaction when somebody touches her while she\u2019s sleeping. Ironically, you just ended up proving that she was, in fact, asleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah! Not only that, but Ed also built some sort of hideout to live in up in the northern forest\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd can you explain just what, exactly, that has to do with the Occupation of Ophelis Hall?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u00a0 I\u2026\u201dProfessor Glast let out a deep sigh.\u201c\u2026 Cleoh. As I told you before, you tend to rely too heavily on your intuition, pushing ahead with things without enough thought.\u201dShe had nothing else to say.Ed was certainly a suspicious student, but there was no physical evidence to speak of.Ed had already finished giving his testimony regarding the occupation. The file itself was a little sketchy, but given the circumstances it made enough sense.The reason Ed had visited Ophelis Hall was because he had a personal appointment with Yennekar. They had agreed to meet out in the rose garden in front of the building. Yennekar had also affirmed that fact.But then, realizing that something had happened inside Ophelis Hall, he went into the building to see what was going on. He later decided that the building was dangerous.Therefore, he had tried to block Taylee and his party from forcing their way into the building. Of course, Ed eventually ended up failing.He was just a respectable upperclassman that was trying to stop his underclassmen from entering such a dangerous place. Well, at least that\u2019s what the testimony said.Aside from Ed\u2019s strange behavior, there was nothing to prove his testimony false. Even though she might feel completely heartbroken about it all, that was a completely different matter.\u201cThink of the difference between your emotions and the physical evidence, Cleoh.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026 I apologize\u2026\u201dIn the end, completely speechless, Cleoh lowered her head.\u201cJust bring your apology over.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dHer excitement was gone as she left the laboratory with a heavy sigh.Professor Glast sat back down, gathering all the files.Finally, when he grabbed the crystal ball that Cleoh had brought, there was an image of Ed standing up. It looked as if he was in combat.Previously known as Ed Rothstaylor, but now just Ed.Given that Professor Glast didn\u2019t remember much about him, it must have meant that he was someone born with little talent.The total amount of magic power he had seemed small, and the level of magic that he used wasn\u2019t all that high.He was someone that you could find anywhere. Someone without talent.Standing in the way of Taylee, Elvira, and Ayla, it was more reckless behavior rather than courageous.This was also all written down in the files. Ed had tried to stop Taylee and his party, but they had broken through in no time.That was just the way things were in the world. Nothing could be solved alone.Professor Glast was a professor that oversaw the magic department students. Though, he had also seen the students from the Combat and Alchemy department before.While he didn\u2019t have the authority to directly appraise any of those students, he had certainly identified a few talented individuals amongst them.Taylee, who was born to the way of the sword. Elvira, who was born with the natural insight to be an alchemist.Those two weren't people that just any normal person could stop.Considering that, Professor Glast continued to look into the crystal ball.He wanted to reaffirm the talents of both Taylee and Elvira.Glast was someone who liked to identify talents, much like a jeweler who appraised shiny gemstones, to determine their value.\u201cOhhh\u2026.\u201dProfessor Glast continued to watch the battle between Ed and Taylee\u2019s party for a long while.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a while, Professor Glast held his chin as he got lost in thought.Stuck in such deep thoughts, he continued to stay still for a long time.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal (1)My peaceful daily life passed by like a fleeting spring. It wasn\u2019t until the season got cold that you came to realize how blessed you were by the clear skies and warmth.Though I couldn\u2019t really say it was all that mild of a life for me, with my busy schedule, compared to when I first started living in the wild it had gotten a lot better.Since my cabin was finished and ready for me to lay in, I had gathered quite a bit of meat, vegetables, and spices up in the storage. I even had a bunch of firewood piled up. I had managed to solve my homelessness issue.The waves that shook my somewhat stable life\u2026 It all came from the senders of three different letters.* * *Keeping up with the school\u2019s curriculum had slowly started to pay off.Even with a body that wasn\u2019t exceptionally talented when it came to magic, I was starting to maintain an above-average performance. It was especially so in the written subjects, and it seemed that I was starting to stand out. My name was being passed around amongst the teaching assistants.Lessons that only required simple memorization and theoretical arrangement could be accomplished at any time with just a bit of effort.By cutting down on sleep and using any spare time to practice repeatedly, I was able to shove all the information into my brain. That was completely different from having talent in magic.My training had also made considerable progress.I\u2019d already increased my stamina quite a bit, to the point that it wasn\u2019t far behind that of an average adult male. It was quite an impressive development when compared to the spring, when I was skinny and as weak as an anchovy.On the other hand, my combat-type skills still seemed to be a bit slow\u2026 But there were plenty of ways to help with that.[Newly Finished Product]--Ceremonial Dagger: ExplosionA ceremonial dagger that has been infused with explosive magic.The infused magic can be activated within a certain distance.As it has been infused in advance, the activation speed was quick and the magic power efficiency is excellent.Spiritual Infusion: Spirit-Type Magic - Explosion (Low-ranking fire spirit Mugg)Magic Power Accumulation Capacity: MediumResonance Distance: NarrowProduction Difficulty Level: \u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb[Production completed. Production skills have increased.]A pattern of flames glistened on the surface of the dagger.It was the ceremonial dagger that had been with me for a long time, ever since I started living in the wild. After setting things up and imbuing the dagger that I loved with magic, I felt a sense of pride.[The magic has been infused with the dagger quite smoothly. The more the user has used the equipment, then the more efficient it becomes. I can clearly tell that you have been with this dagger for a very long time, young master Ed!]Sitting on my shoulder, Mugg caught my attention by speaking to me.[You\u2019ve taken another step forward, young master Ed! This joyous occasion makes me so happy! Though I may be unworthy, let me sing a joyous song for you to express my pleasure! This is a shepherd's song, passed down for generations by mouth in the Pulan region\u2026 Eghk!]I grabbed Mugg\u2019s wing as I put him down on the tree stump next to me. As I sat staring at him, it seemed as if he was uncomfortable, his body shifting around.[Y-Young master Ed! I have made a mistake! Please allow me to pay the price for my sin! The most embarrassing thing is, I am unsure what I have done wrong! Please, tell me the sin I have dared to do so I can sincerely reflect on it, correct it, and grow from it\u2026]\u201cHey. Speak to me casually.\u201d[\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what?]As expected of a spirit carefully selected by Yennekar, Mugg was quite the amazing low-ranking spirit.He was proficient in mana resonance, and he constantly called me young master. In an instant, the infusion of spiritual magic was completed. His way of thinking was flexible, and he was quite nimble\u2014which was helpful while hunting.Not to mention, he also acted as my portable heater and was a great companion in my social life. Thus, he was worthy of a perfect score.But if I had to label just one fault of his, it would be that he was overly polite.\u201cI said speak casually. It\u2019s uncomfortable for me to keep listening to you like that, seriously.\u201d[Th-there\u2019s no way. There\u2019s no way I could do such a thing!]\u201cWhy?\u201dOriginally, the relationship between an elementalist and a spirit was a simple contract, rather than one between a master and servant.The lower-ranking spirits that dealt with Yennekar were excessively respectful towards her, as she was an exceptionally strong elementalist.A spirit that moved away from being a fluid spirit and was on the path to becoming a lower-ranking spirit gained magic power through contracting with an elementalist, which raised their status.If they could make a contract with a competent elementalist with a high level of resonance, then\u2026 It was customary for the spirits to thank them by becoming subservient. Therefore, if you wanted to have equal footing in a relationship with an elementalist like Yennekar, who had a massive amount of resonance, then you would need to be a high-ranking spirit.The reason that Yennekar was surrounded by so many spirits all the time was simply because it was her nature to attract spirits\u2026 After all, it was her high resonance that was extremely attractive for the spirits.In particular, the fact that Yennekar had decided to sign a contract with a lower-spirit like Mugg was very appreciated\u2026 So of course, he had no choice but to bow his head.However, as I was only a novice elementalist that had just started out on my journey, there was no need for him to be so polite. There was a high possibility of running into communication issues if we established me in such an unnecessary position of authority.\u201cTry calling me Ed. It\u2019s only two letters.\u201d[Young master Ed! This really is not right!]\u201cIsn\u2019t it weird in the first place? There's no reason to be this respectful, since signing a contract with me isn\u2019t that big of a deal. What was the deal with all those interviews and the election process?\u201d[Uh\u2026 Um\u2026]I must have hit the nail on the head, as Mugg flapped his wings and struggled to respond.\u201cDid you make some other type of promise?\u201d[Well, that\u2019s\u2026]\u201cJust relax and forget about all of that. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ll only see each other for a day or two, right?\u201dAs I said that, I looked down at Mugg.He shuddered as he suddenly began to wail loudly.[Oh my, young master Ed! What\u2019s the point in me hiding it anymore?! If I sign a contract with you and am recognized for my ability, I will be guaranteed nearly double the amount of refined magic power from Lady Yennekar than the other low-ranking spirits\u2026 In the end, this was all a means for me to speed up my growth\u2026!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs I thought.[That\u2019s right! This overflowing respect and loyalty towards you, young master Ed, didn\u2019t come out of pure awe. It was because of my lust for success, engraved on this dirty unworthy body of mine! I am deeply ashamed of myself!]\u201cAlright\u2026 There, it\u2019s good to be honest like that. Is there anything else you want to let out?\u201d[Other than that\u2026 I\u2019ve been looking into your reputation here at the academy, and I have heard quite a bit about your strong authoritative tendency\u2026 So, following that, I was trying to please you\u2026]\u201cIs that so?\u201dI lifted the dagger with the spiritual magic infused in it. I turned it over, swinging it around a few times. It didn\u2019t feel any different from before.If the spiritual infusion were poor, it could affect the quality of the equipment itself by making it heavier or lighter. That would make it difficult to manage. However, the spiritual infusion that Mugg had completed was clean and showed no notable change.I threw the dagger into the wooden stump nearby.Thud!With the connected spiritual magic, I gave it a little push, creating a small explosion. With that much magic power put into the explosion, it could also work as a small explosive if I wanted it to.As the rising smoke spread out, I could see the dagger stuck in the stump. It was completely fine, not a scratch on it. It seemed that even the fire resistance had been implemented well, as it hadn\u2019t been affected by the explosion. It was perfectly done, up until the very end.\u201cWell, thanks for being honest about it all. Why are you apologizing so much, to the point you're wriggling around like that?\u201dIt was said that, when creating relationships with other people, a pure heart was only maintained until elementary school. After all, once people started to mature they had no choice but to put their self-interests, no matter how big or small, first. This was the case even when dealing with others.The old-fashioned way of thinking, the one that claimed a pure heart must be maintained in a relationship, had long since ended. In the end, one\u2019s skills and attitude were all that mattered.The spiritual magic itself was neatly infused into it.Though asking around about my reputation before we even signed a contract could have been seen as rude\u2026 From another perspective, it also proved that he had done some preparation and shown a level of sincerity.As for me, I was also the type that tried to figure out people in advance, putting in the time to get things right\u2026 So, from my point of view, I could see that he was the type to be thorough about such things.As long as you didn\u2019t treat everything as too materialistic, it could also be considered a useful way of thinking.\u201cAlright, I got it. You can speak casually already.\u201d[Th-that\u2019s\u2026]\u201cI told you I understood, so you can speak casually with me. Your circumstances all make sense to me, so what\u2019s the issue?\u201d[Young master Ed\u2026!]Mugg was touched by my words, speaking in a grateful voice. I wondered how much guilt and shame he had been feeling.[To be honest, it was so hard for me! Waaah! In the first place, the hierarchy of spirits is unfair! Just because you were born earlier, you can take advantage of others? Does that make any sense\u2026?! Waaaah!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[Well, I\u2019ll continue speaking politely towards you. It\u2019s more comfortable for me to do so!]I was about to say something when it occurred to me.I think I heard before that it\u2019s quite burdensome to tell a new employee or recruit to \u2018take it easy\u2019 or \u2018speak casually\u2019.It was only natural to be uncomfortable with such a thing. In some cases, forcing someone to be comfortable would just make them more uncomfortable. So being uncomfortable meant that you were comfortable\u2026 It was all too complicated.Well, he\u2019d figure it out and take care of it. From what I could tell, it seemed that his social life was already at its max level, so he must have had a good sense about how to behave.I pulled out the dagger, put it in a leather case, then tied it around my thigh with string. With that in place, I could stand up and reach down to grab the dagger at any given moment. Plus, it didn\u2019t look all that bad.[By the way, what do you want to do with these letters? Do you want to read over them right now, or should I bring them over to the cabin?]Mugg flapped his wings, sitting down on a wooden stump across the campfire. He was biting three letters, waving them around.One was delivered in a clean, business-like envelope that was folded roughly and lacked a seal. It was delivered to me personally by one of the teacher\u2019s assistants, Anise.The second one was decorated with a golden border and a clean wax seal. A middle-aged employee of the Elte Store had delivered it.The last one was a magnificent, flashy, high-class piece of paper that was written with brilliant and luxurious ink. Claire, Princess Penia\u2019s lead escort, had personally delivered it.\u201cI\u2019m going to read through them now.\u201dEach letter spoke of different topics, but the most shocking was in the last letter.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *Silvenia\u2019s royal residence was quite a magnificent mansion, but compared to Ophelis Hall, the size of it couldn't even compare.However, even though the size might have been smaller, the overall construction cost was quite similar. It was impossible to imagine just how luxurious the interior of the residence must be unless you were someone who had entered before.A woman with a ponytail and an upgraded set of light armor opened the door to the princess\u2019 room.\u201cI've just come back from the northern forest. I have delivered the letter, just as you instructed.\u201d\u201cWell done, Claire.\u201dClaire, the lead escort of third princess Penia Elias Kroel, had been feeling quite troubled of late. For her, as someone who was solely dedicated to Princess Penia, the recent situation had not been very pleasant.The first time the princess stepped foot in Silvenia on her journey to study, she had felt rather pleased by it all.The life of Princess Penia, who was constantly watched by the royal household, on the outside looked splendid. However, if you knew her full story\u2026 None would envy her.Ever since Emperor Kroel\u2019s only son\u2014Lindon\u2014had declared that he would give up the throne, the war of nerves between the royal ladies became suffocating to watch.Both Princess Selah and Princess Perscia had their suspicious eyes on Princess Penia for quite some time.No matter how much she expressed that she wasn\u2019t coveting the throne, because of Princess Penia\u2019s position and the support of the people, she could have reached out and taken the throne at any given moment.In the process of it all, some measure of secrecy and fighting would be necessary. Though influential people that wanted to support Princess Penia were widely available, the order of succession could be \u2018adjusted\u2019 at any time.One way or another.Of course, Princess Penia wouldn\u2019t make such a move. That doesn\u2019t mean people wouldn\u2019t still be suspicious of her.Her entrance into Silvenia Academy was a clever move to convince people of her honesty.It was only possible for those who had no desire for the throne to declare that they would leave the royal household, seeking academics at such a crucial time. That was because she would have to stay in school for at least four years.What kind of place was Silvenia?Wasn\u2019t it a land of academics, where the virtue of learning was greatly emphasized above all else?She thought it would be a good time to get far away from the Kroel Royal Family\u2019s authoritative atmosphere, and to spend a few years making memories and gaining knowledge\u2026 Though such plans didn\u2019t always work out the way you wanted them to.\u201c\u2026 You don\u2019t look pleased, Princess. I\u2019m sorry to be intruding, but\u2026 Do you perhaps have any concerns?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not sure.\u201dPrincess Penia bound her platinum blonde hair back as she let out a deep sigh, burrowing herself into the luxurious sofa.She decided to come clean and admit it.She had made the decision to step away from the Kroel Royal Family to instead focus on her studies in this land of learning, but\u2026 she also had a fervent desire to escape.Getting into a secret battle whenever there was time, gaining authority, proving her talent as a potential sovereign or else risking dying off\u2026 She had escaped from the cruel fate that came with being a part of the royal family.Having lived her entire life like that, she had asked herself, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be okay just to take a few years off?\u2019That was because she had thought that, after a few years, the tedious dispute over the succession of the throne would end on its own.However, even after escaping all the way to Silvenia, in the end that was what happened. As a human being, it wasn\u2019t possible to escape from her true nature. Whether it was intentional or not.\u201cI\u2026 thought that, for the rest of my life, I was destined to live while fighting a dark battle.\u201d\u201cPrincess.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to try to comfort me, Claire.\u201dThe night before, Principal Obel came to visit her, whispering in her ear.The financial situation of Silvenia Academy was already quite a severe problem. They desperately needed money to even make the payment dates for that quarter.Even though he went all the way to visit Princess Penia personally, there was nothing that she could do to help immediately.Although Princess Penia's influence would allow her to receive some funds, there was no guarantee that the money would arrive in time for the payment. But most of all, there wasn\u2019t any justification for it.Although the school was partially supported by the royal family, ultimately Silvenia Academy was a private education institute that was founded by the great sage Silvenia. If such an institute needed further funding from royalty, there would need to be a reasonable justification.The third princess did not control the treasury of the royal family, and at that moment she was in no position to be a part of the royal family.In the end, she had no choice but to turn down Principal Obel\u2019s request. Considering the sheer size of Silvenia, the educational budget wasn\u2019t just a matter of a simple coin or two. It was an issue that couldn\u2019t be dealt with through mere sympathy.That was where the problem should have ended.\u201cIt seems that the sale of the Sage\u2019s Seal will become a reality.\u201d\u201cYes. Of course, there will be strong opposition coming from the students and the academic staff\u2026 Though more than a direct sale, it will just function as a guarantee or collateral.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty sly. Ignoring the rights to possess it and instead focusing on buying the rights of ownership, then taking the product step by step. As expected of the Elte Company.\u201dThe concept of possession and ownership were entirely different.When news got out that the Sage\u2019s Seal, which was the heart of Silvenia, had been sold for money\u2026 There would be a great deal of opposition from the school. In the matter of possession\u2026 That was just a case of acknowledging the right to keep storage of the seal.As time passed, and the attention around everything all started to cool down, they would create some sort of justification to move the Seal from its exhibit at Trix Hall over to the warehouse. Claiming that it was to further research regarding the seal seemed like the most appropriate excuse.The day that Seal would once again be on display would probably never come to pass.\u201cPrincess Penia\u2026 As I thought, you don\u2019t look well.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern, Claire. I\u2019m fine, so you can go rest.\u201dPrincess Penia pressed on her temples as she loosened her shoulders.Penia had been living in a world of secrecy for many years. Seeing the data that Obel brought, along with the way things had been going, it started to seem like there was a black curtain behind it all that she couldn\u2019t see.Her gut instinct pointed to the young Lortel Kehelland, the authority behind the Elte Company.That girl, with her bound reddish-brown hair, always smiling like a fox playing among gold coins. She never seemed to speak honestly.According to Penia\u2019s Insightful Eyes, that girl\u2019s true colors were those of a con artist that plotted and extorted others as naturally as she breathed.She couldn\u2019t get the image of her during the Glasskan Summoning. As the entire sky lit up and buildings collapsed, Lortel sat in a corner and smiled softly. It was truly a level of strength that transcended humans.Thinking of that same girl, plotting to buy the Sage\u2019s Seal as everything played out in the palm of her hand.She decided to admit it.She was scared. It was extremely frightening.In Penia\u2019s eyes, Lortel was a demon covered in gold coins. She was someone that, if wanted to, might even be able to deceive God.She was surely going to end up at the top of the Elte Company. She couldn\u2019t picture Lortel taking orders or being under someone else\u2019s leadership.Someone that could make Lortel follow their orders\u2026 Did such a person even exist?\u201cI don\u2019t need to be hostile towards her yet, but\u2026\u201dBuried in the sofa, Princess Penia silently spoke her last few words.In any case, the suspicions between the school and the Elte Company regarding the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal was strictly an internal matter. It wasn\u2019t an issue for Princess Penia to personally intervene in.Nevertheless, Princess Penia couldn't help but take out a quill as she began to compose a personal letter.A 'new party\u2019 had joined the negotiations for the Sage\u2019s Seal.As for that third party\u2019s actions, it was because they couldn\u2019t leave the situation alone.* * *Ed! Ed!It felt as if I had fallen into water, faintly hearing sounds coming from outside. I wondered if someone was calling my name, but I didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to that.The reason that my head was all mixed up was because of the letters I had received.The first and second letter didn\u2019t say much.They didn't say anything that important, it was just information that I needed to know.The third letter, however\u2026 it was something I needed to read with my full concentration.I couldn\u2019t be taken aback by a change of flow in the timeline, even if it was different from what I had originally thought it would be.It was only natural for that to happen. It couldn\u2019t be helped, as the story had been twisted from the very beginning. I just had to keep an eye on the situation and try to make the progression of it follow a similar course.Either way, if Taylee followed the proper course, everything could be solved\u2026 There wouldn\u2019t be anything else that I would have to get involved in.In Act 2, all that needed to happen was for him to use the second technique of the Swordmaster Skill and prepare his Celestial Magic resistance.But that method would not be allowed. The flow of the story had already slowed down quite a bit.The evidence was right there, in my hand.\u201cEd.\u201dLooking at the cause, it came from Elte\u2019s early dismissal.Elte, the Golden King, was originally meant to be defeated by Lortel during the battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal event.However, for some reason the flow of the story changed, and he was dismissed earlier into the story\u2014during the occupation of Ophelis Hall.Because of that, just what kind of changes did it cause?The reason that Elte tried to purchase the Sage\u2019s Seal was so he could resell it at a higher price.In other words, there was another person who asked him to procure the Sage\u2019s Seal.That person\u2019s name was\u2026 Sadly, I'd already heard it so much now that I was sick of it.I quickly realized why the princess had sent me a personal letter. It was because I was a man on the inside. Her ulterior motive was to ask me if I had any information regarding that person\u2019s actions or intentions.\u201cEd!\u201dI suddenly came back to my senses.Yennekar was pushing her face in front of mine with a tearful expression. It seemed that she had been shaking my shoulder.\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cGet a grip on yourself! What\u2019s the matter?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Yennekar. There was something I was thinking about, so I was distracted for a bit.\u201dAt some point, Mugg had moved to Yennekar\u2019s shoulder as she let out a sigh of relief. Then, as she seemed to realize that the distance between our two faces was too close for comfort, she quickly took a step back.\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too hard! It\u2019s good to be working hard, but\u2026 It\u2019s best to stay healthy!\u201dLooking at Yennekar, who was bubbling over in rage, I put both hands by my side as I bowed my head in apology.As I mentioned before, the one who had commissioned Elte Kehelland to purchase the Sage\u2019s Seal was the head of House Rothstaylor, Krepin Rothstaylor.For Krepin, who was researching the magic of eternal life, the Sage\u2019s Seal\u2014which dealt with Celestial Magic\u2014was well worth looking into.But with Elte dismissed\u2026 that client now had no choice but to roll up his sleeves.\u201cEd, you don\u2019t look so great right now.\u201dYennekar spoke with a worried look on her face. It was understandable.The letter from the princess said that she had a lot to ask me about the head of House Rothstaylor, which I used to be a part of, so I should visit her royal residence. Additionally, she wrote down some of her suspicions regarding Krepin\u2019s actions.Originally, the Sage\u2019s Seal negotiations was a tug-of-war between the school and the Elte Company.However, now it has become a three-way race between the school, the Elte Company, and the Rothstaylor family.The head of house, Krepin Rothstaylor, was a boss that appeared in Act 4 of \u2018Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster.\u2019He was a boss in the later half, who was exposed by Princess Penia, who had both internal power within the school and the power of royalty, as the one behind all the evil deeds that had occurred. There was no need to explain his difficulty level.It was safe to say, at that moment, there was no way to take him down.The good news was that his goal was simple: the Sage\u2019s Seal. If he got his hands on the Seal, he would go back to where he came from peacefully.However, there was no way for me to know what would happen after he got his hands on the Seal\u2026 It would be a completely unknown world.It wasn\u2019t just a matter of no longer having the advantage of knowing all future events. It was also a matter of whether it was possible to clear.In the first place, the confrontation between Princess Penia and Krepin Rothstaylor was a storyline that shouldn\u2019t even have been happening that early on.Krepin Rothstaylor. If it was true that he planned to join in on negotiations for the Seal, then I would have to do whatever I could to try and keep him out of it.He couldn\u2019t be on the main stage of the storyline yet. As a character that came out in the second half meant that he really shouldn\u2019t come out until later.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Yennekar. I shouldn\u2019t have made you worry.\u201dI relaxed my expression as I threw a few pieces of firewood into the fire.I lowered my head as I quietly began to organize my thoughts.Yennekar sat holding her knees with her arms across the campfire. Suddenly, her expression soured as she continued to stare at me.\u201cI\u2019m not going to move from here until you tell me what you\u2019re worrying about.\u201dThat stubbornness didn\u2019t suit her at all. I almost let out a laugh.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal (2)\u201cEd Rothstaylor is a person worth using.\u201dThere was much to eat at the table.The Princess wasn\u2019t one to have a big appetite, so more than half of the food remained. As she was a member of royalty, the food at the table always needed to be more than plentiful.Though it was a waste, due to her status she wasn\u2019t permitted to eat a simplistic meal.After she finished eating, Princess Penia went to the student center in the teachers\u2019 district and found a nice bench to sit on. It was a wooden bench near the square with a table in front of it. There were no other available seats with such a perfect amount of shade to sit under.As she sat down, the attendants that accompanied her quickly took out a parasol to create shade, serving her tea with a tea set and using magic to boil the water.\u201cHe seems to have knowledge regarding the internal affairs of the Rothstaylor Family. He\u2019s been keeping up his act and playing dumb, but perhaps if we appease him more, he may open his mouth. If we can convince him to join our side, perhaps he can act as a spy.\u201dStanding with her hands behind her back, Claire continued to speak to Princess Penia, who was drinking her tea. Their discussion from dinner had yet to reach a conclusion.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was still some time before her afternoon class.Princess Penia swept her platinum blonde hair back with thin fingers as she suddenly looked up at the clear autumn sky.Princess Penia\u2019s Insightful Eyes was screaming in the direction of Krepin Rothstaylor.He pretended to be a benevolent and dignified aristocrat, but there seemed to be a slimy and dark madness that lurking within him.However, without any sort of physical evidence she had no way of doing anything about it. At the very least, she was convinced that the Sage\u2019s Seal should never fall into his hands.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that negotiators from the Rothstaylor Family will arrive at Acken Island sometime next week.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. The decision to sell the Sage\u2019s Seal is something extremely dishonorable, so they would have wanted to keep others out of the conversation as much as possible. How did Krepin, who is a third party, manage to send negotiators?\u201d\u201cThat boy\u2026 It could have come from a report from Ed. Since he lives on school grounds, he might have overheard a rumor.\u201d\u201cDoes he have a reason for that? He has already been excommunicated from the Rothstaylor family, so there is no reason to show loyalty towards them anymore.\u201d\u201cIf I were in that boy's shoes, I\u2019d do whatever it took to be recognized again so that I could return to the family.\u201dClaire explained her view as she nodded her head.For that boy, who was living in the forest, the luxury of being a member of the Rothstaylor family was surely something to be missed. She heard that he struggled through the arduous work every single day, just to survive\u2026 Perhaps he wished to return to his previous lifestyle.\u2018After being excommunicated, he seemed aloof to the hardships in life. Was it really that hard for him to bear the difference from his life as an aristocrat?\u2019Princess Penia gently closed her eyes as she felt a sense of irony from it all.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201dThe one who responded came from elsewhere else. Claire and Penia turned their heads towards a familiar face as the girl approached, sitting opposite of Penia.Her charming eyes and playful lips made her look like a mischievous devil.Her reddish-brown hair, which was usually tied to one side and left to fall over her shoulder, was left loose that day. Her usual hood, which she wore to hide her expression in the shadows, was refreshingly down that day.She wore a headband with a blue rose attached to it that matched perfectly with her reddish-brown hair, creating a somewhat calming air around her.Rather than a mysterious vicious merchant, she looked like a girl that had dressed up.But everyone there knew very well that if you were tricked by that girl\u2019s appearance, you would fall to your own death.\u201cDespite my lowly status, could I have the honor of having a cup of tea with the Princess?\u201dShe had a wide smile on her face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile Princess Penia glared at her, an attendant brought out another cup of tea, placing it down in front of her.The scent of the finest herbs wafted through the air, though ultimately neither of the two reached for their teacups.Lortel Kehelland, who was already a powerful person within the Elte Company, was also a girl who was expected to become the head of it when she was older. It was all a matter of time.Since she wasn\u2019t planning to have a conversation with Lortel, the princess felt rather nervous.\u201cIt may be presumptuous of me to say, but I wanted to answer your speculations regarding Ed taking the side of the Rothstaylor family.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected of you, Lortel.\u201dPrincess Penias' eyes narrowed. Lortel was reflected in her eyes. She had rolled up a bit of the hem of her robe as she slowly reached towards the teacup to enjoy the scent.Princess Penia decided against beating around the bush.\u201cI thought that you hated me.\u201d\u201cOh my, that\u2019s not fair to say, Princess Penia. If that were the case, then why would I have come over here to talk with you?\u201dCleverness to that extent was an art in and of itself.\u201cThe one that brought Krepin Rothstaylor into the negotiations for the Sage\u2019s Seal was not Ed. It was my father, Elte\u2019s, doing.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dPrincess Penia had heard rumors about Elte. News that his dismissal was almost certain, as nearly all his influence and power were gone.Princess Penia had a feeling that something was wrong, since Lortel had a carefree appearance despite the fact her father\u2014who had adopted her\u2014was being pushed into a corner.\u201cThe Elte Company had planned to purchase the Sage\u2019s Seal and sell it to Krepin for a higher price. There seemed to be some agreement between my father, Elte Kehelland, and Krepin Rothstaylor. Though, I don\u2019t know much about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, even if my father has been dismissed, the plans to purchase the Sage\u2019s Seal haven't changed. After all, Elte Company has already put much time and effort into it.\u201dPrincess Penia sat listening to Lortel\u2019s story. Before she realized it, she wasn\u2019t talking much at all.\u201cIt\u2019s about time to change the people who are \u2018responsible\u2019 for the Sage\u2019s Seal, so it\u2019s an ideal time to negotiate the purchase of it. The Elte Company will be busy with that, too. If we don\u2019t pay close attention, then we might lose the seal to the Rothstaylor family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all too strange. Isn\u2019t the Elte Company planning to buy the Sage\u2019s Seal in order to sell it to the Rothstaylor family? If that\u2019s the case, then there should be some sort of consensus between the two. So why do the Elte Company and the Rothstaylor family seem to be competing over the purchase of the Seal?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026 I don\u2019t wish to sell the seal to the Rothstaylor family. I\u2019m in a bit of a special situation right now, so I don\u2019t want to be too close to a client that is connected to my father.\u201dHearing those words, Princess Penia was left speechless.\u201cAnyway, I wasn\u2019t the one who had agreed to sell the seal to the Rothstaylor family. Since it was a confidential contract, even if they complain to the Elte Company, it won\u2019t have much of an effect. That\u2019s why Krepin Rothstaylor personally joined the negotiations for the purchase of the seal.\u201d\u201cWhy are you telling me about this\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe enemy of my enemy is my ally.\u201dSaying that, Lortel smiled with her eyes closed.The fact was, the school was backed into a corner because of their finances, and only a few knew the insider information regarding the plan to sell the Sage\u2019s Seal. Even the true intentions of the Elte Company, as well as the current position of the Rothstaylor family\u2026 She had never imagined that Lortel would give up so much information.\u201cIt seems that you, Princess Penia, want to keep the Rothstaylor family in check. So, isn\u2019t this a win-win situation for the both of us? The Rothstaylor family is pushed out of the negotiations, and I\u2019ll be glad to walk away with the seal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe should have a friendly relationship, haha. After all, we are schoolmates that share a lot of the same classes.\u201dHer smile was like that of an awl. Even though she appeared useful, if you reached your hand out to her it would be easy to get stabbed.Lortel Kehelland and Penia Elias Kroel\u2026 It was like a relationship between two sides of the same mirror. They probably wouldn\u2019t understand nor acknowledge each other until they died.\u201cWell, I thought that Ed, who is innocent, would be hurt by all of this. As his underclassmen, I was worried.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 were worried about him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already been cut off from his family and is now living a new life. Wouldn\u2019t it be unfair to mistake him as a part of the Rothstaylor family?\u201dPrincess Penia narrowed her eyes again.There was no way that girl would think of helping another in purely good faith. It seemed certain that she had some other intention behind her defense of Ed.\u201cEven so, that boy\u2026 There\u2019s definite value in using him.\u201dAt that point, Ed was the only one who would have an idea of the internal situation regarding the Rothstaylor family.Indeed, having lived most of his life as a member of the Rothstaylor family, regardless of how incompetent or arrogant he might have been, there was a high chance that he had at least\u00a0some\u00a0information.However, judging people by their value and using them like consumables\u2026 that was not Princess Penia\u2019s style.\u201cI tried to ask for help person-to-person, as well as using my authority to give orders\u2026 But if he still doesn\u2019t open his mouth\u2026\u201d\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I\u2019ll have no choice but to \u2018use\u2019 it.\u201dThe Princess of Benevolence Penia was someone that treated everyone with respect, but didn\u2019t always fall into idealism.If necessary, there were also times where she needed to have a cold heart. She didn\u2019t realize that.In response to Princess Penia\u2019s reply, Lortel\u2019s face stiffened for a moment. Suddenly raising her hand, as she flung her hood over her head.She trembled a bit as her head lowered, hidden beneath the shade.\u201cLortel Kehelland?\u201dJust what type of reaction was that? Was she lost in her thoughts?Without appearing to care at all about the bewildered Princess Penia, Lortel kept her head down for a long time.Soon after, a splendid-looking pigeon flew in and landed on Lortel\u2019s shoulder. Nevertheless, Lortel continued to keep her head down for a while, before reaching her hand out towards the pigeon.\u201cO-oh my\u2026 A homing pigeon sent from the main headquarters\u2026\u201dSpeaking softly, with a trembling voice, Lortel raised her head. Princess Penia was briefly taken aback. Claire, who was guarding her, felt her blood start to boil.Lortel had been forcibly holding back her laughter and looked about to burst.\u201cYou tricked and used me.\u201dLortel, who could no longer hold it back, stood up as she spoke.\u201cWho did what to whom?\u201d\u201cYou! This blasphemy\u2026! How dare you do that to the princess\u2026?!\u201d\u201cPrincess Penia.\u201dLortel Kehelland already had a complete understanding of Ed Rothstaylor.Even though he might be backed into a corner, she thought that there was no way a princess like Penia\u2014who grew up constantly pampered and protected\u2014would be able to take advantage of him.Normally, she would have been laughing secretly as the Princess attempted an impossible task.\u201cPrincess Penia. Only in this instance are we allies. The Rothstaylor family, who are the public enemy, must be driven from Acken Island. Thus, I would like to offer you my sincere advice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try and take advantage of him half-heartedly, as he might just end up taking advantage of you instead.\u201dAs Lortel spoke, she stood up\u2014still holding the homing pigeon.\u201cI hope you have the generosity to excuse my rudeness. That is my whole-hearted advice to the princess.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going, Lortel?\u201d\u201cI have an appointment with someone. Even though I dressed up quite a bit, I ended up messing up my hair by unnecessarily wearing this hood. Ugh. It wouldn\u2019t be polite of me to continue interrupting the Princess\u2019 break time, so I'll take my leave.\u201dLortel courteously gave her greetings.\u201cI hope you remain healthy.\u201d\u201cYou have to hold her accountable for her disrespectful actions, Princess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Claire.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *Though she didn\u2019t like to establish her authority, Lortel\u2019s actions were certainly rude. Princess Penia didn\u2019t feel great about it either, but she had many other things to worry about instead.Above all else, Lortel\u2019s attitude toward Ed seemed to have changed drastically.Simply put, Lortel was someone who, on the outside, would appear superficially courteous towards her superiors. On the inside, however, she had a tendency to constantly weigh their worth.Determining her intentions and understanding the way she treated Ed was too confusing.Even after being excommunicated, he had adapted surprisingly well to academy life, had performed fairly well in a few subjects, and was often said to be a more hard-working person than expected.On top of that, he had even caught the attention of the Elte Company\u2019s fox, Lortel. Thus, she started to have doubts on whether or not her Insightful Eyes were wrong.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, little by little, she started to feel a strong sensation on one side of her heart.Ed Rothstaylor.It was because Princess Penia herself was the one who had caused his excommunication. Even if she didn\u2019t intend to, that fact wouldn\u2019t change.Ultimately, the emotion that was flowing inside of her was a sense of guilt, though it was only a small amount.The difference between their status was massive, and there was no other special relationship between the two.Being swayed by the guilt of causing an inconvenience to such people over a momentary mistake would only stand as an obstacle to her growth as a monarch.As a monarch, she must also know how to deliberately ignore even the slightest sense of guilt.\u201cClaire. I sent a personal letter, but please personally check on it. We\u2019ll have to summon him so that he can visit the royal residence soon.\u201dAnyway, it would be necessary to keep an eye on Lortel Kehelland\u2019s movements. She was quite the scary opponent.She wondered if she would ever be able to see that girl be taken aback or at a loss.That idea alone seemed too far-fetched. Princess Penia let out a sigh.The path that a monarch took while dealing with others was a long and difficult one.* * *\u201c\u2026 What is this?\u201dLortel sat down on the sofa in the sitting room with a puzzled expression. She looked completely bewildered.\u201cIt just happened.\u201d\u201cHi, Lortel. Long time no see. How have you been?\u201dYennekar smiled and greeted her warmly. Her smile was so bright that it almost seemed like flower petals were flying around.Despite its clean and fancy appearance, the sitting room of the Elte Company\u2019s Silvenia branch was not frequently used.Very few VIPs came to the store\u2019s branch, which was built out in Acken with limited space. Thus, using it even four or five times a year was considered a lot. Given how beautifully decorated it was, it was quite the shame that it was used so infrequently.Lortel and Yennekar faced each other as they exchanged greetings, smiling as if they were the happiest people in the world.\u201cI apologize. I didn't realize you were coming, so I was only able to prepare two cups of Pulan Mountain rosemary tea. Would you like some cold water instead?\u201d\u201cSure, that\u2019s okay! It seemed like there was a lot in storage, but I guess you can\u2019t use it since it\u2019s for sale?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right! If you had told me you were coming in advance, I would have prepared it sincerely. I thought that I would only be eating with Ed, so I didn\u2019t think to prepare it in advance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just drink cold water. Here, Yennekar. You drink it.\u201dYennekar smiled as she responded with a \u2018sure\u2019, taking the cup of tea. Lortel sighed, glaring at her with a look of disgust in her eyes.\u201cWell, I checked over everything in the letter. Looking through it, it was about Elte.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. The Elte Company seems to have finished the process of his dismissal, but it appears that he\u2019s up to something. He accepted the dismissal a lot easier than I expected.\u201dThe climax of Act 2\u2019s storyline, the Glast Subjugation, followed the battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal. It didn\u2019t seem that there had been any major changes.However, the unexpected change following Elte\u2019s early dismissal and Krepin\u2019s participation seemed like it needed to be dealt with properly.Krepin Rothstaylor, who dealt with the power of the evil god Mebula, was not someone who could be defeated at that point in time.I had to \u2018delay\u2019 that from happening until after Taylee and I raised our specs some more.In the first place, Princess Penia\u2014who would stand opposite Krepin in his subjugation\u2014was still too weak.She couldn\u2019t use any of her power as part of the royal family due to being kept in check by the first and second princesses. She could not speak up on behalf of the school, either, as she had not yet become the student council president.\u201cI was worried that Ed might be getting harassed. That\u2019s why I called on you, to see if there was anything wrong.\u201d\u201cI see. Surely, with Elte being in a tight spot, it\u2019s impossible to be sure of what he is going to do. We\u2019ll have to be sure to stay on top of it.\u201d\u201cEven so, there\u2019s a limit to what he should be able to do with such little influence and power. Oh, that\u2019s right. Would you like to take some of the magically engineered items back with you?\u201dAs Lortel spoke, she opened a cabinet and pulled out various crystal balls, magic books, a quill, ink, and the like.\u201cThese are items that haven\u2019t sold for a long time, so there\u2019s no issue with having you take them.\u201d\u201cLortel. Aren\u2019t these all brand new products, without even a speck of dust on them? You\u2019re going to be criticized for giving these things away for free, as it goes against a merchant\u2019s ethics.\u201d\u201cOh my, Yennekar. It seems like you really don\u2019t have a good eye for these things. Look here, they\u2019re all defective items.\u201dHearing that, Yennekar went over to the cabinet and checked each item. There was a small crack in the crystal ball, the quill was broken at the tip, and the magic ink was slightly opened, some already poured out.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you did it on purpose! Does it make any sense for there to be such flaws in these brand-new items?!\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s not for me to judge. The only thing that\u2019s important is whether or not I can sell it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, considering Ed\u2019s position, it's also important whether or not it will help him.\u201dAs Lortel spoke, Yennekar was left speechless.\u201cI appreciate it, but receiving all of this for free is a bit\u2026 I haven\u2019t even paid off all the magically engineered items you gave me last time.\u201d\u201cOh, I already transferred the payment to the next contract. It\u2019s more convenient to just pay it all at once. Plus, the later the payment date, the more convenient it gets, right? It\u2019s always better to have the payment date pushed back.\u201d\u201cThat is true, but hasn't the payment date already been moved back four times?\u201d\u201cWell, there is no problem as long as you keep coming back to renew your contract. From our position, this is just a small amount of money.\u201dLortel looked at me and tilted her head, smiling brightly. Yennekar suddenly began to puff out her cheeks.\u201cIsn\u2019t it more convenient to just finish paying it all off, ending the contract as quickly as possible? What if Ed was planning to spend that money on something else? Now he has to end up spending it all on this instead?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s something for \u2018me and him\u2019 to discuss on our own, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cAhh! Seriously!\u201dYennekar grumbled as she stomped her foot on the floor. Lortel ignored her, acting as if it were nothing. Meanwhile, I laid back on the sofa, not thinking much of either of them.- \u201cEven then\u2026 Ed is\u2026\u201d- \u201cThe place he does that is\u2026\u201dOnce again, a familiar sensation started to spread throughout my body.It felt as if I was swimming in water. Recently, I\u2019d been falling into that state quite a bit.The surrounding sounds began to fade into distant echoes as I let my mind drift into a state of weightlessness, the sensation of floating through the air washing over me.Come to think of it, I still had a lot of work left to do after my visit to the Elte Store.I needed to go and put away the jerky that was drying back at camp before Lucy came and touched it.I also needed to clean up inside of the cabin again. I would have to finish cleaning before I put the chair, desk, and bedframe inside.Then there was the mattress I needed to make for my bed. It might have been impossible to make a modern mattress with springs, but I thought I\u2019d be able to make it somewhat fluffy by cutting up some material and stuffing it with feathers, random pieces of clothes, and leftover fabric.I also needed to trim the baby deer that I had caught the day before yesterday. The process of tearing off its skin for leather, taking out the intestines, and then cutting and smoking each piece took a lot of time.I also didn\u2019t finish my Elemental Studies and Introduction to Intermediate Magic assignments. There was also the other Magic History assignment to do, as well as preparing for my Herbology practical next week as well.Come to think of it, I was completely out of arrows. I needed to make sure that my exercise clothes were dry in time for my jog to school the next day. The cabin\u2019s window needed to be completed, and I needed to prepare some more firewood before winter arrived. There was also the issue of food preservation, which I still needed to solve, and I needed to learn how to make proper winter clothes.- \u201cEd. Ed!\u201d- \u201cHey, Ed?\u201dAs I slowly organized all the work I needed to do, I started to feel hazy again.It was as if I was swimming through water as I felt myself getting buried deeper into the sofa, little by little.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026[You have been inflicted with an abnormal condition!]* * *- \u201cThat guy, he seems to have gotten his act together.\u201d- \u201cAll he does is quietly listen in class, finish his assignment, then go home.\u201d- \u201cI heard that he was kicked out of the dorm. Where is he living now? I would imagine it's hard to find a decent place to stay on such a remote island. Plus, he\u2019s completely broke.\u201d- \u201cSurprisingly, he\u2019s quite good at his studies. He actually seems to be trying quite a bit?\u201d- \u201cHe seemed to be so arrogant and rude before, so I didn\u2019t want to get any closer to him. But now, even though I hate to admit it, he seems like a hard worker and a regular guy.\u201d- \u201cThinking back on it, it\u2019s true that he really was a terrible person before. As time passed, maybe he became more aware of it and started to change?- \u201cSometimes I see him in the classroom, but he doesn\u2019t say a word. He seems to be really focused on his studies. I wonder what\u2019s with him?\u201d\u201cWas he actually an honest and hardworking person?\u201dWhen someone turned over a new life, trying to become a better person, at most they would last a month.After about a month or so, they would revert to their old ways. But for Ed, he had been living that ridiculous lifestyle at that camp for almost half a year.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA private bedroom in the royal residence.At a large, luxurious personal table, Princess Penia sat alone, letting out a sigh.It was about time for her to admit it.Seeing his honest, hardworking appearance as he fished back at his camp, his appearance during the Glasskan Subjugation, where he proceeded to form a good plan of action without getting flustered\u2026 Not to mention, his reputation among the students of being someone that was heavily focused on his studies\u2026 And Lortel\u2019s warning not to carelessly make judgements about him\u2026Other than that, there was her intuition and the clues that kept whispering to Princess Penia.\u2018Maybe, just maybe, my Insightful Eyes were wrong.\u2019If that was the case, her judgment ended up causing a healthy, hardworking boy to be kicked out of his family, leaving him broke and forced to survive in the woods\u2026 Did she really make that mistake?Either way, she had sent Ed a personal letter through Claire, asking him to visit the royal residence immediately.Since it was an order from a member of the royal family, he was bound to come by and visit the royal residence.She would then have the chance to properly determine who he was.And if, by chance, her judgment was wrong\u2026 She would truly come to accept the truth.\u201cPrincess.\u201d\u201cClaire.\u201dWith that thought in mind, Claire knocked on the door. She must have come to report on something, and it was obvious what it was about.\u201cDid you finish the schedule for tomorrow? What time will Ed Rothstaylor be\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m afraid that he will not be able to visit for the time being.\u201d\u201cWhy is that? Regardless of his circumstances, it was still a royal order\u2026 If he has the intention to refuse, shouldn\u2019t it be accompanied by a justifiable reason?\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to use her authority, but either way a personal letter written by Princess Penia was no different than a royal order. Refusing such an order meant that there had to be some sort of reason.\u201c\u2026 He has collapsed from overworking.\u201dHe had always been a strong man.Thus, hearing the news, Princess Penia couldn\u2019t help but have her doubts.\u201cHe must have overworked himself past his limit, trying to manage both his survival activities and his studies. Currently, he is in an unconscious state.\u201dHowever, there was a limit to one\u2019s diligence.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal (3)[Abnormal Condition: Exhaustion]High fever, indigestion, chronic fatigue, migraines, periodic unconsciousness, shortness of breath, vision loss, maladjustment to magic power, state of muscle atony.Please get sufficient rest to get rid of your abnormal condition!I knew the fact that there was a limit to a person\u2019s vitality very well.While it was great to work hard on my survival activities and training until the day I graduated, I also realize that it would all be meaningless if I didn\u2019t take care of my health.Because of that, I had tried to check on my physical condition consistently and to live as healthily as possible, making sure to consume a variety of nutrients. However, it couldn\u2019t be helped that I still had an absolutely enormous amount of labor-intensive work to take care of.Although they say that the symptoms that come from being overworked differed between individuals, I had no idea that the fatigue would come on as quickly as it did. It hit me like a storm. Before I could even attempt to straighten myself out, I ended up fainting. I couldn\u2019t resist it in the slightest.Everyone experienced moments throughout their lives where they had fevers that were hard to endure.Even when lying down not doing anything, it could be hard to breathe.Even when you tried to straighten out the haziness in your mind, you would find yourself caught up in the sensation of floating out into space again.You would return to your senses, lose them again, and then later return to them again.As my vision briefly returned, through my vision it appeared that Yennekar, whose face was completely stiff, and Lortel were talking about something.After that, I lost my sense of clarity once more and I fell into a dreary world made up of my old memories.Memories of playing Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster\u2019s Act 2, Chapter 10\u2014the battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal and the Glast Subjugation.The finale of Act 2, told through Taylee\u2019s eyes after he got caught up in it\u2026 It had definitely begun when Professor Glast kidnapped Taylee\u2019s companion, Ayla.I faintly recalled the story of the act\u2019s finale, which I had watched absentmindedly through a monitor.An extraordinary scholar, born with an immense academic talent that surpassed anyone else in history. He made dozens of magical advances that no ordinary person could easily achieve. His name was the great sage, Silvenia.I clearly remember Glast\u2019s story, where he tried to resurrect Silvenia by studying Celestial Magic that twisted the providence of the world.He tried to reopen the doors to the age of progress once more by infusing Silvenia\u2019s spirit into the body of Ayla, who was also born with a scholarly talent\u2026 It was the story of a madman.A character that failed to achieve his dreams, dying by falling from the top of the tower of magic power he had embodied.Just what was that guy\u2019s research about, and what was the deal with the age of progress\u2026? Why did he make such a ridiculous choice, abandoning his ethics and career? Even amongst the players, there were lots of people who questioned Glast\u2019s actions.Though, I guess if you could understand it easily, you couldn\u2019t call it the story of a madman.Most of all, before all his plans came to an end and he fell from the top of that tower of magic, his final words were rather unexpected.The last line he had uttered before his death; about his dreams of academic progress, the age of progress, and dedicating his entire life to discovering those with talent.The top of the tower of magic power, made up of Celestial Magic. Spreading both of his arms out, talking about the world and confessing his will just before his death\u2026 What\u2026. Was it\u2026?\u201cZzzz\u2026\u201dMy eyelids snapped open with a start. As if against my will, it was telling me that it was time to wake up.My entire body was heavy, especially my lower abdomen. What was this chunk of meat on my lower abdomen? When I looked to see why I had a hard time lifting my torso, I saw a girl with a giant witch hat\u2014the size of her head\u2014lying on my stomach.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Too\u2026 Salty\u2026 Only a little\u2026\u201dThat kid\u2026 How can she be so annoying, even when asleep?I tried to lift her up and throw her aside like usual, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t lift her.Lucy is just as light as she looked. So light, you had to wonder if she was really even human\u2026 To the point that you could easily carry her while moving.Lucy seemed to be the same as always, so maybe the reason that I couldn't lift Lucy was because of my physical condition.I was in a completely weakened state. Even though I had a mountain of work to do, my body had reached its limit. I let out a deep sigh as I laid back down.The scenery is familiar. It was my cabin, but the blanket was new\u2026 It must have been a product from the Elte Store. I didn\u2019t know exactly what happened, but I have a vague idea.Without much trouble, I could remember the image of Yennekar and Lortel making a fuss.\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dMaybe as a response to me moving, Lucy opened her dopey eyes with a blink.She rubbed her sleepy eyes and sat up, looking straight at me while still sitting on my lower abdomen.Then, staring back blankly into the air, she said\u2026\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cDo you really do nothing besides sleep and eat?\u201d\u201cOh. Congratulations. You\u2019re conscious again.\u201dShe then raised up her hands into the air to roll up her overly long sleeve before she pressed her index finger against my solar plexus.She continued to speak slowly, in a rather soft whisper.\u201cYour magic power got really twisted. Since you have been constantly overdoing your training the last few months, familiarizing yourself with elementalism, and not properly resting, you ended up like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe flow of magic power will gradually come to a stop while you are asleep. By taking advantage of that time, when you wake up and move your body around again you can do so more efficiently. Didn\u2019t you learn that in your Magic Power Studies class? By training your magic power to your very limit right before sleeping, only to barely sleep at all\u2026 That\u2019s why you ended up like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Even though you\u2019re always sleeping in class, I guess you\u2019re quietly following along with everything.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t listen because I already know everything.\u201dThe flow of magic power began to swirl around Lucy\u2019s finger, the one that was pressing down on my solar plexus.Lucy continued to stay still with a blank face, acting as if nothing special was happening. Before long, her collar and wide-brimmed hat began to flutter.\u201cI\u2019ve been pushing down on you like this so that the flow of magic power won\u2019t get any more tangled. It seems to be untangling a bit now.\u201d\u201cDid you keep doing this while I was sleeping?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing too hard. Though, I fell asleep a few times, since it\u2019s so boring.\u201dA refreshing feeling spread across my body from Lucy\u2019s finger. While I was unconscious, I had felt the sensation of the energy in my body returning at times, but that must have been thanks to Lucy.\u201cThat gaze.\u201d\u201cGaze?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 When I\u2019m next to you, there are people that keep on looking at us. It\u2019s annoying. Well, what I'm doing is necessary, so they can\u2019t really say anything about it.\u201dAgain, I felt that relaxing sensation go through my body. It made me feel much lighter. Taking in a deep breath, I felt as if I was starting to gain back some of the strength in my body.\u201cAs for the physical issues regarding your vitality, there\u2019s nothing that can immediately be done to help besides getting some rest. Though, I\u2019m sure the magic power has all been taken care of.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dCalling out to Lucy with no real purpose, she glanced down at me without a single change in her expression.Her light gray eyes, which didn\u2019t move an inch, seemed to be calm and peaceful. Rather, that dull feeling of hers made me feel more comfortable.\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get sick. It\u2019s difficult when you\u2019re sick. There are even people that die when they get sick.\u201dThat line. If you knew about Lucy Mayreel\u2019s past, it wasn\u2019t something you could easily ignore.The archmage Glockt, who had given her the blessing of the stars.A rainy night.Lucy sat next to Glockt, who was like her grandfather, as he lay dying in bed.I didn\u2019t know how many days I was unconscious, but it was clear that it wasn\u2019t a short amount of time.Thinking about the fact that she was sitting next to me all that time, pressing down on my tangled magic power\u2026 it must have been an unbearable pain to her, being around someone that was sick.No matter how much of a jerky thief she was, or how much she resembled a stray cat by breaking into my house in her free time\u2026 Even though her expression never changed, and you couldn\u2019t determine what she was thinking\u2026 I had no choice but to guess what was hidden inside of her.As a result, there was no choice but to at least say thank you.Squeak.\u201cOh, you\u2019ve regained consciousness. I didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay to use the stove inside the cabin, so I set the fire outside\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the cabin door swung open and an unexpected person walked in.After sweeping his long, unkempt hair back, Ziggs Eiffelstein entered with a lively greeting before suddenly going stiff.Lucy was on top of my lower abdomen, pressing down on my chest, when she turned her head and looked up at Ziggs.With her blank face, she grabbed her hat and vanished in an instant. Only a fleeting afterimage of the wind was left as proof that that lazy genius had been there.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZiggs swiped his bangs up at once as he entered the rest of the way, sitting down comfortably on a wooden chair with a look of disbelief on his face.\u201cEd, just how many people have you\u2026? A-as expected. It\u2019s not that unusual for a strong male to have several females.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this\u2026 the open mindedness that comes from a civilized society\u2026? Perhaps I have been looking at a civilized life with too much of a stereotype\u2026\u201dIf I left him as-is, when Ziggs went ahead and laid his hand on another woman, Elka would lose it.First, I had to clear up the misunderstanding.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *\u201cSince Yennekar was sick at the start of the semester, it would be dangerous for her to miss any more classes. Lortel kept on pushing back her work at the store, but when it got to the point where she couldn\u2019t do it anymore, she went back to the commercial district.\u201d\u201cI see. But how did you end up taking care of me in the cabin?\u201d\u201cLortel came and asked me to. Though, I\u2019m kind of dense when it comes to something as delicate as taking care of someone else. Women tend to be a bit more dexterous and delicate when it comes to these things when compared to men. I asked her if it would be better to ask a girl\u2014like Elka, Anise, or Clara\u2014instead, but she said that this was a life-or-death situation, and I needed to do it\u2026 So that\u2019s what happened.\u201dZiggs scooped up some soup from a pot and handed it to me.I at least had enough strength to hold up the bowl and spoon, so I took a bite. It didn\u2019t taste that great.It seemed that he had made it with a bunch of random ingredients and poor skill.\u201cIn the first place, don\u2019t you manage your school life yourself? There aren\u2019t many people who know of you or are that close to you. They had to find someone who would agree to help, which is why they came to me.\u201d\u201cI see. It must have been a pain. Thanks.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Either way, I was just going to either rest or train, so I was able to just do it here. I hope you can take care of yourself. When I first saw Yennekar\u2019s face, I thought there was going to be some sort of funeral.\u201dZiggs let out a sigh as he poked the fire with a poker.\u201cWell, since it\u2019s not a chronic disease, and it only happened from overworking yourself, there\u2019s no need to make a fuss. You\u2019ll get better after a few days of rest. For the time being, you won\u2019t have much strength in your body. Just take this chance to take a break from classes.\u201d\u201cYeah. I got a bit complacent when it came to taking care of my body. I feel bad making the people around me worry so much.\u201d\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. This is something we\u2019re doing because we want to. You should just focus on recovering your health.\u201dTo be honest, the soup tasted awful, but hearing Ziggs\u2019 words\u2026 I felt as if my body was soaking in nutrients. I kept forcing myself to move the spoon.My current prerogative was to time to check on the things that I needed to investigate.\u201cThinking about it\u2026 I heard that the alchemy students were caught up in an accident, something about secretly mass-producing Mandragora?\u201d\u201cOh. It was Elvira, that troublemaker\u2026 In the end, Taylee and Clevius took care of it before it became a bigger issue. It didn\u2019t make its way to academic affairs.\u201dAct 2, Chapter 5, \u2018Exploring the Alchemy Department\u2019s Society\u2019, seemed to have ended well.\u201cI heard there was a rumor that a monster the Telos Religious Group was taking care of snuck back into the underground waterways of the school.\u201d\u201cTaylee and I took care of that. Ayla accidently dropped a pendant into the underground waterways, so we went to find it. There, we happened to cross paths with the monster, so we took care of it\u2026 Was there really a rumor about that?\u201dAct 2, Chapter 7, \u2018Devil of the Underground Waterways\u2019, also seemed to have been completed without any problems.I could have inferred that the incidents were resolved by the rumors and the external changes that came around from time to time\u2026 but I was relieved to have heard it directly from one of the characters involved.I wondered if the only big event left really was the battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal.With that thought in mind, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't yet confirmed what I needed to check.\u201cCome to think of it, how many days have I been unconscious?\u201dI thought that it was only going to be a day or two as I brought up that simple question.Ziggs responded light-heartedly, though I wondered if it was even okay to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s been ten days. Everyone is going to go crazy when they see that you\u2019ve woken up.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThough, they won\u2019t be able to see you today. At this hour, Yennekar should be at school, and as for Lortel\u2026 She had an important negotiation to prepare for tomorrow, so it would be hard for her to come.\u201dThe negotiations regarding the sale of the Sage\u2019s Seal.Tomorrow was the day it would take place.My breath caught for a moment.I hadn\u2019t finished gaining a proper idea of the current situation.I had no way of knowing how the tables may have turned while I was unconscious.\u201cHey, Ziggs? Can you tell Lortel something for me?\u201d\u201cWhat? Is it something urgent?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 It might sound a bit weird, but\u2026\u201dIf I had enough time, I\u2019d consider more options as I tried to pick the safest course of action. But in the current situation, I had to use every method that I could.\u201cSo\u2026 Uhm\u2026 There\u2019s something that I want. If I just have that one thing, then\u2026 Really, I think I can answer any request you make\u2026 Anything it may be\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 All of a sudden?\u201d* * *Call meeting with the negotiators.Luncheon.Verification of the Sage\u2019s Seal condition.Confirm purchase method.After collecting each person\u2019s bidding price written down on a parchment, the highest bidder will purchase it.Proceed with the transfer of the \u2018resonance owner.\u2019Afterwards, dismissal.After reading the report on the itinerary for the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal, the piece of paper in Princess Penia\u2019s hand burned to ash.The fact that the Sage\u2019s Seal was going to be sold had yet to be publicized.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrincess Penia had asked the school to allow her to attend the negotiation as an observer.Although there was no need for the Princess to attend the negotiation, as it had nothing to do with the royal family, the school listened to her request as it came from royalty. As long as there was an excuse, it would be fine.In any case, negotiations involving such a hefty sum of money were often accompanied by witnesses to observe and provide public credibility. As she was a part of the royal family, her public credibility was as heavy as the weight of her lineage.The number of people participating in the negotiation for the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal was small. In the first place, there weren\u2019t many groups that could afford to pay that much.In the end, the Elte Company and the Rothstaylor family were the only ones left.It had appeared that there would be fierce negotiation between the two over the purchase. Surprisingly, the decision seemed as if it would end in an instant.The young principal, Obel Forsyth, had come up with a pretty clever idea. It was like an auction, as he was going to sell it at the price they named.However, he wouldn\u2019t disclose a suitable starting bid.The Elte Company and the Rothstaylor family.With the two bidders submitting their price on a piece of paper, he would end up selling it to the one with the higher price.\u201cFor this\u2026 It\u2019s highly likely that the bid will go in Krepin\u2019s favor.\u201dThat was why Princess Penia\u2019s nerves were on edge.Simply put, the Elte Company was involved with the negotiation with the intention of buying a \u2018product\u2019 to make a bigger profit.On the other hand, the Rothstaylor family seemed to want to get their hands on the Sage\u2019s Seal for a bigger reason. If it wasn\u2019t to make a profit, there was a high chance that they would be willing to spend a considerable sum of money, to the point that one would wonder if it was really okay.Even if he did end up losing the deal, he\u2019d be prepared to then negotiate with the Elte Company, who would be the new owners of the seal.Of course, there was no way of knowing what an appropriate amount might be, and they couldn\u2019t randomly spend a large amount of money. That was why there was going to be a war of nerves between them.\u201cTelling them about this method only a day in advance\u2026 The Elte Company and the Rothstaylor family must be experiencing headaches over this.\u201d\u201cOf course, Claire. If they let them know too far ahead in advance, they could end up meeting and negotiating how much they would charge.\u201dIf the school wanted to make a profit, they needed to make it so that it felt as if the Elte Company and the Rothstaylor family were fighting against an \u2018unknown enemy.\u2019The pressure of not knowing how much the other would spend\u2026 They wouldn\u2019t be able to know how much they should raise to safely get their hands on the seal.\u201cPrincipal Obel was quite smart about it. You don\u2019t want to drag on the negotiation for too long, as it may start to spread strange rumors. It\u2019s good to handle it this way and end the bidding as quickly as possible. There\u2019s also a lesser chance of losing money. But\u2026 No matter how hard I consider this method, Krepin will surely get his hands on the seal.\u201dThe Elte Company was unlikely to see any real value in the Sage\u2019s Seal.\u201cAs expected, I\u2019m uneasy about this\u2026\u201dJust what was Krepin trying to do by getting his hands on the Sage\u2019s Seal?The lack of information on Krepin also made her feel uneasy. If only they could have figured out what the mysterious Duke was thinking, then\u2026 The situation would probably have become a lot clearer.Unfortunately, Ed\u2014who was the clue to it all\u2014had been unconscious for nearly ten days. Because of that, she was completely in the dark.If she couldn\u2019t ask Ed directly, then why not try asking the people around him? She had thought of doing that before.After all, anyone who was close to Ed might have heard something of his inner thoughts or background.However\u2014according to the rumors\u2014Ed was always quiet during school, just listening during his classes and focusing on his practical training. He seemed like someone who didn\u2019t have many relationships. Also, he always appeared to be rather busy, as he was working hard just living one day to the next.Princess Penia sighed as she sat still on the corner of the school\u2019s bench.\u201cWhen I traced the rumors about him at school, it said that the only person who could be considered close to Ed Rothstaylor was the second-year top student, the elementalist Yennekar Palerover.\u201dClaire, who was standing next to her, tried offering her advice.\u201cI could try and call on her, though I am unsure if we can get any sort of meaningful information from her.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to. I had already met her once, as I was walking through the school grounds.\u201dA person would have to have been living under a rock to not know of Yennekar Palerover.Both when she was caught up in the Glasskan incident and during the disciplinary committee hearing afterwards, Princess Penia had assisted her.The pink-haired girl had once sent a letter of sincere thanks to the royal residence, in order to formally show her gratitude.Since she was a girl who was loved and gave love to everyone\u2026 The princess felt a bit jealous.Wherever she went, she brought the impression of flowers blooming. Everyone smiled brightly as they spoke to her.Everyone lived happily ever after.She was truly a girl that should have been the main character of a fairytale.\u201cI asked her about Ed Rothstaylor during a joint elemental studies class about a week ago.\u201dHowever, it was after Ed had fallen unconscious.When Penia met Yennekar at school\u2026 Yennekar looked at her with cold eyes.She had no idea just what kind of change of heart she had.Yennekar played around at school with her usual bright and lively manner, but towards Princess Penia alone she lacked a friendly attitude. She tried to not show it too much on the outside, but it was clearly visible to Princess Penia.The reason for that\u2026 It was obvious. It was the same with Lortel.Even that innocent girl, who was loved by everyone in the school, was not on Princess Penia\u2019s side.Considering that fact, Princess Penia took a deep breath.The autumn sky was high and clear.\u201cAnything?\u201dIt was a hectic time. She had wanted to visit the cabin to check on Ed\u2019s condition at least once, but the work regarding the Elte Company was piling up and weighing down on Lortel\u2019s shoulders.Lortel, who had her hair tied to one side, let out a sigh. She then offered a cup of tea to her unexpected visitor.\u201cAnything? I didn\u2019t expect Ed to say such a dangerous thing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, Lortel. I\u2019m sure you also know his true nature.\u201dAs Ziggs sat down on the sofa in the sitting room and drank his tea, he let out a sigh.Lortel, who was already weighed down by her work, straightened her shoulders and gave a sly smile.\u201cAnything, huh? You\u2019re a merchant that you\u2019ll do anything\u2026 You\u2019ve made quite an unusual mistake, Ed.\u201dIn the sitting room, where the darkness started to slowly settle, Lortel tried to stifle the smile threatening to spread across her lips.Just what was she imagining\u2026? Even if she tried to stay still, that crazy smile of hers started to show. It was terrifying to Ziggs, who was watching her. He could still see her worry about Ed, who had only just gotten out of bed.\u2018I\u2019m glad that Elka is so pure.\u2019The world of civilization was a world that was both mysterious and terrifying.The time for the negotiations had come.Sadly, nobody realized yet that the boy laying in a cabin in the woods held all the keys.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal (4)It would have been faster to find the parts without any fancy decorations.A jacket lined with gold frames and a cape embedded with a flying eager pattern. Mahogany cotton pants underneath a shirt with voluminous frills. Every corner of his outfit was covered with jewels.The loose jewels and decorations he wore symbolized his vanity.After all, the most direct way to show off one\u2019s wealth and high honor was to have a luxurious appearance.Strangely enough, Krepin Rothstaylor looked rather serious and sharp, even in such flashy attire.He had a sharp jawline and eyes that didn\u2019t match his age. He was a peculiar person that didn\u2019t make any unnecessary movements, while at the same time giving off an aura of gentleness and class.You could tell with just one look that he was not an ordinary person.As the head of the Rothstaylor family, he was one of the few key influential figures in the Kroel Empire\u2026 He had the vigor to make others intimidated just by glancing towards them.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Headmaster Obel wasn\u2019t able to personally attend. I\u2019m quite worried, as his health appears to be deteriorating. I hope he gets well soon.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll make sure to tell the headmaster that Duke Krepin has asked about him.\u201dKrepin, who took a sip of soup in a dignified manner, expressed his regrets towards Deputy Headmistress Rachel, who had shown up in place of the headmaster.It was extremely discourteous that the president had not come out directly to greet Krepin despite his visit. Either way, the expression of regret ended shortly after as Krepin, who had one of the highest statuses in the room, changed topics.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you look healthy, princess. His Majesty was quite worried about you, seeing as you have come here to study.\u201d\u201cThank you, Duke Krepin. Please tell my father that I am adjusting well to my school life and studying hard.\u201d\u201cAs your command. Additionally, though it has been a while\u2026 I haven\u2019t yet been able to formally apologize. I heard that you had quite a hard time because of my stupid child. It has already been quite a while, but I have since excommunicated him, as you ordered. It still bothered me greatly that I had yet to properly apologize to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Duke Krepin. Don\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201dPrincess Penia humbly rejected Krepin\u2019s apology with a somewhat stiff face.Meanwhile Lortel, who sat at the luncheon for a while watching over them, didn\u2019t say a word.Krepin also did not appear to care about Lortel\u2019s presence.The Deputy Headmistress of Silvenia, The Princess of the Nation, and a Duke from the Rothstaylor House.It was a meeting of nobles with names that were enough to make others kneel without hesitation, regardless of where they went.The fact that Lortel, who was born in the slums, was sitting at the same table as them was practically an insult. It was only natural that she wouldn\u2019t open her mouth rashly.The position of chief executive at the Elte Company was by no means light, but it was not an official title.Elte\u2019s dismissal was almost certain, and the next person to become head would be entirely on Lortel\u2019s side. The weight of power that Lortel would come to hold\u2026 Even they wouldn\u2019t be able to take that lightly.However, \u2018as of now\u2019 that situation was taking place entirely inside of the Elte Company. Since there was no official announcement, it was only natural for her to still be treated in such a manner.So Lortel continued to smile as she kept her head down\u2026 She looked over at Krepin with eyes that were as sharp as the knife in her hand.That man was one who shared the same blood as Ed Rothstaylor.He was famous for his honorable, dignified, benevolent, and wise household.Indeed, that reputation of his wasn\u2019t false\u2026 She even felt a sense of sincerity coming from the vassals that followed him.She could feel the sense of respect directed towards Krepin from each and every one of them.\u201cAs for you\u2026 You must be the stand-in for the Elte Company.\u201d\u201cYes, my name is Lortel Kehelland. It\u2019s such an honor for me, who is not worthy, to be sitting here.\u201d\u201cThe Golden King, Elte Kehelland\u2019s only child. I am familiar with your profound insight and your spirit in taking on challenges.\u201dIt was just a formal compliment from Krepin as Lortel responded with gratitude, giving off her business-like smile.She was sure that he was well aware of what was currently happening to Elte inside of the company, but the two of them kept on smiling.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you had your eyes on the Sage\u2019s Seal. As expected, when there\u2019s something good on sale it will always attract the attention of merchants with good eyes.\u201dLortel gave a humble smile in response to Krepin\u2019s cunning words.\u201cWe always head towards the scent of money. If there's something for sale that will make a good profit, we will always make sure to visit there.\u201dSoon after the luncheon ended, the Sage\u2019s Seal was brought out to the central conference room in Trix Hall.A few moments were given so that both the Elte Company and the Rothstaylor Family could use the scholars, who were experts in magic books, they brought over to verify the authenticity of the seal.After taking time to report on the condition of the seal, the amount of magic power inherent in it, and the current situation of the resonance owner, the meeting moved onto the main event.\u201cAs for the situation\u2026 I won\u2019t be going into detail.\u201dThe situation in which the Sage\u2019s Seal needed to be sold off was a major disgrace for Silvenia.Even though they didn\u2019t want to make it into a big deal, they couldn\u2019t sell it off at a low price to those who didn\u2019t have the power to purchase it at a larger price.\u201cFrom our point of view, we want to avoid a situation in which negotiations are dragged on to the point that unnecessary rumors begin to circulate. As you both heard last night, I\u2019m asking you to both write down your bid and submit it\u2026 We will then sell it to the person who listed the higher offer.\u201dA sheet of parchment was placed in front of Lortel and Krepin, who sat far away from each other in the conference room.The carefully opened parchment was imbued with all sorts of preservation magic.It was a method to prevent the use of magic ink to change what was written halfway through.Krepin stroked his chin, lost in thought.Lortel slowly closed her eyes.The Sage\u2019s Seal was a unique, one-of-a-kind item in the world. Though, there were previous sales of similar books recorded in the history of commerce.Lortel knew about all the previous, unprecedented large-scale book transactions throughout history. For her, such market knowledge was no different than multiplication tables. It was only natural that she would memorize everything.\u2018The Magic Book of Order\u2019, which had dozens of materialistic type magics imbued in it by the genius alchemist Karl, had a final bidding price of 8100 Plen gold coins.\u2018The Book of Habitual Routine\u2019, which was the only magic book on organism replication magic analysis and was currently stored in the imperial library, had a final bidding price of 6730 Plen gold coins.Finally, the Archmage Glockt\u2019s personally handwritten magic notes, regarding his visit to an unknown continent down in the south, had a final bidding price of 7020 Plen gold coins.The value of the inherent magic, the value of being an academic material that still needed to be researched, and the value of it simply being a luxury item all had to be considered when determining the bid.In the end, the key was how much profit you could make off it.Watching the two quietly look down at their parchment, Princess Penia\u2014who came as a notary\u2014carefully watched over them.\u201cI have received your bid. Thank you both for expressing your valuable opinions.\u201dThe school\u2019s staff greeted them politely shortly after, and Deputy Headmistress Rachel unfolded both of their submitted parchment.The result was the exact opposite to what Princess Penia had expected.Attendee: Krepin Rothstaylor (Representing the Rothstaylor Family)Presented Amount: 8900 Plen Gold CoinsAttendee: Lortel Kehelland (Representing the Elte Company)Presented Amount: 9400 Plen Gold Coins* * *\u201cAll she has to do is raise the price and it will work out. Even if she goes on the offense to get her hands on the Sage\u2019s Seal, she still won\u2019t face a loss.\u201d\u201cIs that so? But isn\u2019t that something you don\u2019t know for sure?\u201dSitting next to the fire, Ziggs handed me some more soup.On the second day, it felt like my body had regained some of its energy. After having my magic power untangled, it seemed like my body\u2019s condition was recovering rapidly.\u201cThe Elte Company isn\u2019t the type of business to go around randomly digging for gold, right? I didn\u2019t expect Lortel to accept your offer so easily, especially since she\u2019ll face a loss if she\u2019s not able to sell it at a higher price.\u201d\u201cNo matter how high she raises it, the Rothstaylor Family will buy it from her. Either way, she won\u2019t end up facing a loss.\u201d\u201cDoes the Rothstaylor family really place that high of a value on the seal? To the point where they are willing to buy it, again regardless of the price she asks?\u201dLooking at Ziggs, I nodded my headBut that was a lie.I had no idea just how much the Rothstaylor Family would be willing to spend on the Sage\u2019s Seal.If Lortel really ended up buying it at such a ridiculous price, then even the Rothstaylor Family might give up on the seal.In any case, Krepin was researching eternal life, while the Sage\u2019s Seal was related to Celestial Magic. It was only acting as a secondary piece of research material, to assist with his goal. In other words, he could still continue with his research even without it.There was no way that Lortel, who was an outsider, would know that. Even if she did, Lortel had still agreed to what I asked of her.There were two reasons for that.The first was because Lortel felt affection towards me.The second was that she was betting on the unique fact that I used to be a part of the Rothstaylor Family.She had invested in my suggestion because she thought I might have been aware of some of the internal circumstances within the Rothstaylor Family.Just listening to my explanation of it all might make it sound like I was complete trash.It seemed like Lortel was spending an astronomical amount of money just to prevent Krepin from purchasing the Sage\u2019s Seal.Well, most of the money could be returned, even if she had to sell the seal at a lower price. It wasn\u2019t not as big of a loss as one might think\u2026 But it still wasn\u2019t a small amount of money by any means.In my defense, it didn\u2019t matter how much money Lortel used in the first place.She wouldn\u2019t even have to pay for it.In any case, the Sage\u2019s Seal would end up getting stolen by Professor Glast the day before the sale took place. In the end, the deal would never go through.That was just so that I could make sure to keep Krepin, who was trying to squeeze his way into the current flow of the story, away.Rustle.Suddenly a rustling sound came from a patch of grass. As Ziggs and I turned our heads, a girl whose face we were quite familiar with came walking into the camp. Breathing hard, it seemed like she had run over in a hurry.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Yennekar. It\u2019s not even lunchtime yet, but you\u2019ve already made it here from the teacher\u2019s district?\u201d\u201cYeah! My morning class is already over! There\u2019s no other class that I need to attend, and I can just take care of my assignments later tonight!\u201d\u201cEven so, you should have eaten lunch first\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry!\u201dYennekar smiled faintly as she took off her outer layer, twisting the ends of her light-pink hair as she walked over to the campfire.\u201cEd! You\u2019ve regained consciousness!\u201d\u201cOh, Yennekar. I\u2019m sorry that I made you worry. I heard all the details from Ziggs. It sounds like I\u2019ve caused you a lot of trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cHm? No, no way!\u201dYennekar waved her arms around in an exaggerated gesture as she shook her head, taking note of my complexion.\u201cI really wasn\u2019t worried, not even a bit! So don\u2019t say that you're sorry because you thought I was worried! Really! I wasn\u2019t worried a bit! Not in the slightest! I didn\u2019t even care!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Yennekar. There was even a rumor that you ran across the school grounds on the verge of crying. On top of that, when you went into the school\u2019s conference room last time\u2026\u201d\u201cHaaaa! Heeey!! That\u2019s quite a funny story, Ziggs! But look at today! Isn\u2019t the weather quite chilly?! Better be careful!!! You don\u2019t want to catch a cold!!!!!\u201dSeeing her breathing heavily after running through the forest, I felt even worse for her.She was definitely a girl with a big heart. Even though she was worried, she didn\u2019t want to hear someone apologize for making her worry.Yennekar, flustered, looked around\u2026 After taking a few deep breaths, she came towards me and sat down.As soon as she did, a bat suddenly popped out from behind Yennekar\u2019s back.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *[Please kill me, young master Ed! Please kill me! I am unworthy, as I had no idea that young master Ed was overworking himself!]\u201cWh-What? Mugg? You were there?\u201d[I wanted to come out right away to bow in apology, but I was worried that manifesting this worthless body of mine would only hurt young master Ed\u2019s magic power more. So right now, I am now using Lady Yennekar\u2019s magic power instead!]Yennekar nodded at those words as she looked at me.Mugg flew around before he landed on my lap, bowing in apology with tears running down his face.\u201cWhy is he making such a fuss?\u201d\u201cConsidering how you looked while unconscious, isn\u2019t much that of a fuss.\u201dHearing what Ziggs said, my face went pale. They said that I resembled a corpse and, when considering just how unsightly I was, I couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cI guess so\u2026 being unconscious for ten days, it makes sense\u2026\u201dTen days.\u201cWait a minute\u2026 Ten days\u2026?\u201dI quickly rose from my seat. Even though I hadn\u2019t fully recovered my strength yet, I managed to slowly move my body over to the underground tunnel I dug out to check on the meat I was storing.All the meat that I\u2019d been working so hard to smoke\u2026 As I poked my nose inside to take a look, a rotten smell filled my nostrils.\u201cU-Ughk!\u201dI furrowed my eyebrows as I quickly plugged my nose.The smoked meat could only be stored for about five days without any issues, so I was consuming it according to the order I was preserving it\u2026 But after being unconscious for ten days, all of it had gone bad.Also, when I went out to the river to check, the fishing net was torn up after not being maintained. All the fish that I had previously farmed had swam away in search of freedom.\u201cI\u2019ve lost all my food.\u201dI let out a deep sigh as I returned to the fire and sat down. It was my fault that I hadn\u2019t properly taken care of my own body, so there was nothing I could do about it.It seemed as if I didn\u2019t have much of a choice but to use some of the money I'd been saving up on food so I could eat. It was not a big loss, but it\u2019s still a painful mistake that would hurt in the long run.When I started thinking about having to survive through the winter, there was still so much work I needed to take care of. But having been pushed back so much\u2026 I let out a deep sign.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of overdoing it again, aren\u2019t you Ed?\u201dAs if Yennekar read my thoughts, she came rushing closer to me.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ed. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cI can lend a hand until the next exam period. If it\u2019s simply hunting or carpentry, I can definitely help out.\u201dZiggs spoke as if it was no big deal as he shoved the poker into the fire.\u201cAs long as we keep on working little by little, eventually we can get the job done, right?\u201dHearing his words and seeing that smirk of his, he truly seemed like a man who had survived out in the wild on his own.As long as I took care of the work bit by bit, I\u2019d somehow be able to make it through it all.Sitting by the fire and looking up, I watched Yennekar and Ziggs put their heads together, contemplating what problem we should take care of first. Suddenly, I was reminded of a similar scene from the previous spring.Sitting down, completely broke in the woods, without anything to my name\u2026 I slept while hugging myself under a wooden shelter that I built in a hurry.Falling asleep by myself while being bitten by bugs in the dark\u2026 I suddenly realized that such a past hadn\u2019t been all that long ago.That\u2019s right. There was a lot of troublesome work to take care of, but I\u2019d managed to deal with even worse situations while living out in the woods.The flow of the original timeline had gone awry, but there\u2019s no reason for me to complain all that much since I\u2019d been able to solve every major issue.As for the work regarding my survival, I could get help from the two of them as I slowly recovered my health.The flow of the story\u2026 If Krepin lost the bid, then there wouldn\u2019t be any other variables. That meant there wouldn\u2019t be any major problems.But just in case, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down.* * *The bid submitted by the Elte Company had ended the negotiations for the purchase of the Sage\u2019s Seal.Krepin Rothstaylor was bewildered, though he soon got rid of that expression as he looked towards Lortel with a gentle smile.Lortel smiled back at him.Only a few transactions of that magnitude regarding a magic book had taken place before.Of course, the Rothstaylor family would have come up with a price according to the market price.The highest price ever for a magic book in history was only around 8000 gold coins.In other words, he thought that if the main goal of the Elte Company was to \u2018make a profit\u2019, they wouldn\u2019t submit a higher price than that.That\u2019s why Krepin had chosen to go from 8000 coins up to 8900 coins.Lortel had read that far in advance and called for a higher sum of money to surpass Krepin.It was a battle in which Krepin had lost from the very start.That was because the goal of the Elte Company was ultimately to \u2018make a profit.\u2019\u2018Wasn\u2019t her goal to make a profit\u2026?\u2019Sitting in the audience, Princess Penia\u2019s expression was frozen.A merchant was a man whose actions were for the sake of creating a profit. Lortel\u2019s offer of 9400 gold coins made no sense, considering how much would be needed to break even.Considering the prices of magic books in history, it\u2019s unlikely that she would be able to resell the Seal at a higher price.Lortel was not the type of person who would bet on making profit when there was only a small chance of success.She must have had another intention than making a profit.However, Princess Penia\u2019s Insightful Eyes were crying out. The true nature of Lortel truly only consisted of the greed for gold coins.If making a profit wasn\u2019t the goal, then what made that foxlike girl to do something like that?In the first place, it was difficult to use the true strength of the Sage\u2019s Seal unless you were an owner with a proper resonance with it. Even with that in mind, without a proper understanding of Celestial Magic there\u2019s no use in it.If it wasn\u2019t to take advantage of the seal\u2019s magical strength, and it wasn't for its academic value, and it wouldn\u2019t generate a profit\u2026Why did Lortel go so far as to accept the bid for the seal, despite all those reasons against it?If you ruled out all those values, just why would she make a bid for the seal?\u201cHm\u2026\u201dKrepin had an unusual expression on his face.He politely greeted the audience as he left the meeting room with an awkward expression on his fac. He didn\u2019t seem all that happy.Only then did Princess Penia feel as if she had been struck by lightning.If you looked at the purpose of the Sage\u2019s Seal, ignoring all of its pre-existing value, the goal of owning it was to make sure Krepin Rothstaylor was kept in check and not able to go ahead with his plans.That was the reason Princess Penia was so concerned in the first place.\u201cPrincess Penia. Only in this instance are we allies. The Rothstaylor family, who are the public enemy, must be driven from Acken Island.\u201dThat line from Lortel stung Princess Penia\u2019s heart again.However, there was still one thing that was strange.Lortel had tried to prevent Krepin from being able to buy the seal at a lower price.However, if you ended up buying it at that high a price, what was the point of trying to keep Krepin in check?What if she didn\u2019t care about purchasing the seal in the first place\u2026?What if she was just trying to keep the seal out of his hands instead?There was no other explanation. Otherwise, someone like Lortel\u2014who lived and died to make a profit\u2014wouldn\u2019t have bought the seal at such a high price.With that being the case, a new question arose.Just why on earth was Lortel trying to keep Krepin in check?Princess Penia knew the answer. Krepin was a seemingly dignified and benevolent duke, but he was actually a villain that hid his evil intentions.However, even with the authority and power that came from being a princess, she didn\u2019t have evidence to prove his sly innermost thoughts to the world.Krepin was so meticulous that he made sure to never leave a trail.Even with Lortel\u2019s power and influence as a merchant, she shouldn\u2019t have been able to find anything related to Krepin\u2019s innermost darkness. No matter how influential she might be, she couldn\u2019t dig up information on someone like him.Even if she were able to, there would be no reason for Lortel to step up and take action to stop Krepin\u2019s dark plans.That was because there would be no reason for her to confront such a powerful, influential person.What was needed was a sense of justice against wrongdoings. Or a sense of duty to punish the evil.Those things\u2026 That was too different from the type of person Lortel truly was. In other words, it wasn\u2019t Lortel\u2019s intention to stop Krepin.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dPenia blurted out her words in a stream of thought.If that was the case, then there was someone who had used or manipulated Lortel\u2026 Did it even make any sense for such a person to exist?As a merchant, she had a rare, exceptional talent\u2014going as far as to be called the Golden Daughter\u2026 Just who could control someone like her?Lortel was, to say the least, a person who tended to reign over the situation. She wasn\u2019t the type of person who liked to be under someone's thumb. Penia had thought that she was like a wild wolf, unable to be tamed by anyone.\u201cPrincess Penia, you don\u2019t look so well. Are you uncomfortable?\u201dPenia bowed her head down quietly in the corner of the conference room. She didn\u2019t bother to respond to Claire\u2019s words.There was someone that tried to stop the Sage\u2019s Seal from falling into Krepin\u2019s hands.If that proposition was established, then there needed to be a prerequisite.There had to be someone else that knew Krepin Rothstaylor\u2019s dark nature.If there were someone like that at Silvenia\u2026\u201cPrincess Penia?\u201d\u201cIt may be presumptuous of me to say, but I wanted to answer your speculations regarding Ed taking the side of the Rothstaylor family.\u201dLortel\u2019s words regarding Ed stabbed her heart like a dagger.Excommunicated from his family, tossed into the wild, clenching his teeth while working hard to survive, to the point that he had collapsed from overworking\u2026 If he was the one that was trying to fight the darkness inside of the Rothstaylor family\u2026It was Penia Elias Kroel herself who had brought such a person down into the abyss.* * *Certificate of Sale.Buyer: Lortel Kehelland (Elte Company)Seller: Obel Forsyth (Silvenia)Sale Price: 9400 Plen Gold CoinsDate of Contract: Transfer of resonance ownership (7) days after the certificate signing.Further Details of the Contract....Rolling up the signed certificate of sale, she held it close with a bright smile.According to Ed\u2019s message, no matter how much she bought it for, the Rothstaylor family would buy anyway. She believed in his words and aggressively raised the price.She was willing to put half of her trust into Ed. After all, he was an insider from the Rothstaylor family.As for the other half\u2026 Well, if things didn\u2019t go the way Ed said, Lortel was skilled enough to resell it for at least 8500 gold coins.The difference of 900 gold coins could be considered a loss, but thinking of it as the cost of a free pass from Ed\u2026 It was a bargain.\u201cAnything\u2026\u00a0Anything, he said\u2026\u201dLortel let her hair fall loose as she put in some accessories.The mysterious, foxlike appearance that she had shown at the negotiation table was nowhere to be seen. Standing in front of a mirror, she was putting on a rose-shaped blue headband.\u201c\u2026 Anything? Really?\u201dShe began to blush.Even that devilish, cold face of hers at the negotiation table would turn into that of an innocent, sweet girl in a game of tug-of-war between man and woman.Because of that large gap in appearance, she seemed to be out of her mind. All she was able to do now was look at the newly received piece of jewelry she placed on her head.If the Princess had witnessed that scene, she would have vomited blood.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50The Battle for the Sage\u2019s Seal (5)[He looks like he\u2019s having a tough time.]The wind blew by. The natural wind that flew through the forest was always pleasant, but the wind that tickled Yennekar\u2019s cheek was not one from nature.It was the high-ranking wind spirit, Merilda.Her grayish-brown fur, which pleasantly fluttered in the wind, appeared to be lighter than it actually was due to her size.Merilda whispered to Yennekar, who was leaning against the guardian tree.[Yennekar, as you already know the school\u2019s curriculum isn\u2019t all that easy, right? Even for a top student like you, you\u2019re still so busy. But since he\u2019s also been taking care of the camp, he must have reached his limit.]\u201cSo you also think the same, Merilda.\u201dShe definitely had a different attitude then when she dealt with Takan.Holding her knees in her arms and swallowing her saliva, she listened carefully to her close friend\u2019s words.[But this is still a chance, Yennekar. Even that firefox won\u2019t be able to come to the camp, as she is extremely busy with negotiations and the like. You need to take advantage of this time.]\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d[Humans fall for one another easier when they are pushed to their limits. Don\u2019t feel guilty. Take advantage of this crisis as much as you can. It\u2019s okay to act a little bit sly or greedy since you need to make him fall for you immediately. You are going to need to control the situation.]\u201cCan you explain it more thoroughly?\u201d[Hm\u2026]Unlike her appearance, Merilda\u2019s voice and behavior were quite delicate and modest. Though, there was no way her thoughts could be considered the same.[Whether you like it or not, you must act somewhat like a fox to snatch him up, Yennekar. In that respect, that firefox is a bit smart. You need to learn what you can from her.]Merilda sat with her feet folded and her head raised. She then cleared her throat.[For example, your outfit.]Yennekar was completely shocked at the fact that Merilda\u2019s love advice was so valuable.Since she thought of trying to cook some dishes at the campfire, she had been secretly taking a bunch of ingredients from the school\u2019s cafeteria. Usually, that wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Luckily Bell, who understood the situation, turned a blind eye to it.Since she was planning to cook, her outfit was rather simple. She rolled up the sleeves of her blouse, which she had washed several times over. She also wore a shawl around her waist, cinched tightly over her navy-blue skirt. It was something that she had often worn back on the farm in her hometown.She remembered Lortel\u2019s glamorous and beautiful frill dress from before. She had let her reddish-brown hair\u2014usually tied to one side\u2014flow down, and she wore a headband with a large blue rose and an amber accessory with it\u2026 She was so beautiful that one couldn\u2019t help but stare in awe.Then comparing that to her current self\u2026 Yennekar\u2019s appearance was closer to a vibrant village woman, rather than an attractive one. There was quite a big gap between her current appearance and her usual neat and cute school uniform.[100 points, Yennekar. You have become a fox.]\u201cHm?\u201dThe one who calls herself a so-called genius of love advice (No practical dating experience) gave out a favorable comment.\u201cDon\u2019t I look pretty ugly right now?\u201d[Yennekar, you\u2019re also quite sly. You have your own charm. That current overwhelming vitality of yours, which is unlike your usual cheerful and energetic self, that gap\u2026 Men are obsessed with that. That appearance of yours, pretending that you\u2019re not sly, that appeal is great.]\u201cR-Really\u2026?\u201d[Let\u2019s try rolling up your sleeves and tying your hair up. Try to give off the picture of a wife that stays by her husband\u2019s side, even through a difficult moment. That\u2019s great.]\u201cOh, yeah! That\u2019s right! I have to be at least this sly!\u201dSeeing Yennekar rolling up her sleeves, acting as if that was her plan from the start, Merilda let out a sigh inside. Yennekar seemed to think that she had been acting perfectly sly.It would have been great if Lortel had pushed some more so she would act a bit greedier, but at least she was finally smiling again. She really was like a sheet of clean white paper.How would she end up dating someone at that rate?She was going to get tossed aside with a broken heart after following the advice from a third-rate romance novel.Merilda was very interested in the various cultures that the humans had created.Sometimes, she would try to evaluate artwork that humans tilted their heads towards. Other times, she would use inexperienced transformation magic to turn into a human and borrow books from the library,Merilda remembered the third-rate romance novels that she had occasionally read. Yennekar seemed to have the same characteristics of the girl who got a broken heart in the book.A young girl, who gripped down on her handkerchief as she called out the name of her lover, who was no longer with her. With that scene and classic direction constantly coming to mind, Merilda couldn\u2019t help but worry about Yennekar.She didn\u2019t want her to copy an outdated method like that merchant girl, who was playing hard to get.Though, if she wanted to seduce him, she at least needed to know how to make him long for her.[Anyway, you\u2019re planning to go see him later today, right? If you throw away this golden opportunity, even if the gods forgive you, I won\u2019t. Go make some type of progress today. Alright?]\u201cWh-What? Progress\u2026?\u201d[Never mind. Just tell me now. What were you going to do at the camp today while helping him out? How were you going to try to narrow the distance between you two?]\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2026\u201dYennekar lowered her head, avoiding eye contact, and spoke as if she were embarrassed.\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t planning to do that.\u201d[Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]Nearly bursting into flames, Merilda began to thoroughly question Yennekar.[Does that make sense?! With an opportunity like this! Do you think there\u2019ll be another time someone like him suffers to this extent?! Look at the way he\u2019s growing! It\u2019s at a ridiculous pace! An opportunity like this doesn\u2019t come easy! There\u2019s no better way to win than to spend time with someone in a crisis! You need to act as the person who will support him during this tough time! Even if it\u2019s a little greedy of you! Or a bit manipulative!]\u201cW-Well that\u2019s true. So\u2026 I wasn\u2019t planning to do anything\u2026\u201d[Huh?! Just what the heck does that mean?!]\u201cNo, I mean\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s just what I think\u2026\u201dAfter hearing Yennekar\u2019s following explanation, Merilda was left completely speechless from shock.Afterwards, taking a moment to think\u2026 She started to think that it was just like Yennekar.Merilda nodded her head as she thought. Perhaps that could also act as a means of attack.[Fine. It\u2019s very much like you, Yennekar.]At that remark, Yennekar buried her head in embarrassment.* * *\u201cYour nickname as the \u2018Golden Daughter\u2019 will soon be a thing of the past once Elte\u2019s dismissal becomes official.\u201dLortel had no idea that Krepin Rothstaylor would personally travel all the way to the sitting room at the company\u2019s Silvenia branch.His actions were so unexpected to Lortel that she was forced to prepare for his arrival as quickly as possible to sit down with him.\u201cTo travel directly to the residence of a lowly merchant, who only knows of greed and how to count coins, I feel both honored and a bit worried at the same time. Perhaps my staff\u2019s attitude was disrespectful towards you in some way?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much.\u201dKrepin sat across the table as he brought the cup of tea to his mouth.Though the store prepared the best product they had, it was probably nothing more than plain water for someone like Krepin.Lortel slowly lowered her gaze as she sat opposite of him.She was counting every breath she took, doing her best to keep from choking on her own spit.Krepin Rothstaylor was someone that you couldn\u2019t relax in front of.However, as his intentions were somewhat predictable, there was no reason for her to be overly nervous.\u201cI\u2019ll buy the Sage\u2019s Seal from the Elte Company.\u201dThe tone of his voice sounded as if it was already decided that the Elte Company would sell the seal.\u201cIf you just tell me the amount that you were thinking of, I\u2019ll give you even more. In the first place, isn't that what you planned?\u201dThe reason that the Elte Company had raised the price when buying the Sage\u2019s Seal was because they were confident that Krepin Rothstaylor would buy it in the first place.That fact\u2026 It felt as if Krepin already knew it.\u201cBut\u2026 It's strange.\u201dKrepin lowered his head as he spoke in a low voice.\u201cDid you know beforehand that I was going to spend so much to get my hands on the Sage\u2019s Seal? As far as I know, the Elte Company wouldn\u2019t normally make such a risky investment like this.\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as if you\u2019ve heard about my true intentions and feelings from someone else.\u201dLortel didn\u2019t make the mistake of changing the pace of her breathing or stuttering over her words.However, Krepin\u2019s statements themselves were cutting straight to the point.\u201cDo you have an informant that knows about what\u2019s going on within my family?\u201d\u201cYes. Something like that.\u201dMaking up a ridiculous lie would only raise new suspicions.If she starts to act complacent here, Ed Rothstaylor would end up getting hurt.There\u2019s nothing strange about a businessman using an informant to make a profit. As Krepin\u2019s own actions led him to making a mistake, he wouldn\u2019t be hostile towards the Elte Company. However, he would never let the inside traitor get away freely.No matter how benevolent Duke Krepin might be, he would still harm Ed, who has been selling away the family affairs after being excommunicated.\u201cHowever, as they are located far away, it\u2019s a bit difficult to communicate with them. Also, as they are someone with a rather higher status, the amount of money they have asked for is rather large. So now, I will need to get back as much as I have invested\u2026 That is the essence of business.\u201dLies are more effective at deceiving an opponent when mixed with a bit of the truth.Rather than thoughtlessly and constantly denying the fact, or claiming to not know, it was more efficient to skillfully guide the opponent in a direction that is different from the truth.It was easy to judge whether another person\u2019s words were true or false. However, the act of clearly dividing the line between truth and lie\u2026 No matter how much intuition you might be born with, it was not an easy task.Lortel was a negotiator who knew how to use that fact effectively.\u201cSo, how much will you charge?\u201d\u201c12000 gold coins.\u201d\u201cGood. Once you receive the seal from the school, I\u2019ll buy it immediately.\u201dThere was no reason to bicker over negotiations any further. On the surface, it was a very straightforward deal.The Elte Company had officially won the bid for the Seal from the school, so once the transfer of possession was complete, they would have the right to resell it. Until then, all they could do was wait.\u201cAh, there was one more thing I wanted to say. I\u2019ll get a headache if things get any more complicated, so I\u2019ll let you know in advance.\u201d\u201cOh my. What is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about your father, Elte Kehelland. As he has already been demoted, he\u2019s none of my concern any longer. However, if it starts to get in the way of my business, it\u2019ll only be my loss. That\u2019s why I will tell you this in advance.\u201dKrepin lowered the cup of tea as he continued to speak in a low voice.\u201cAfter his dismissal was certain at the head office, he gathered some of his personal assets and a mercenary group. I received a document the day before yesterday that reported he was crossing through my territory on the way to Silvenia.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *\u201cWhat?\u201dLortel had already known that Elte\u2019s actions were suspicious, but she didn\u2019t think that he had already started taking action.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not going to try to do anything crazy at Silvenia Academy, as it receives the empire's protection\u2026 At the very least, he seems to have something in mind. I hope that I won\u2019t have to get caught up in this situation, which will only delay my business.\u201dWith that, Krepin gathered his servants as he left the sitting room.Lortel saw Krepin out before she sat alone in the room, drinking the remaining tea. She needed some time to organize her thoughts.In any case, the reselling of the Sage\u2019s Seal seemed to have been set.In the first place, Ed had only asked her to buy the \u2018Sage\u2019s Seal\u2019\u2026 which she did without violating his request.Ed also knew that she was going to resell the Sage\u2019s Seal in the first place. All she did was follow through with Ed\u2019s request.Thus, as soon as the purchase of the seal is complete, she would be able to ask Ed to do \u2018anything\u2019 she wanted.What a sweet sound. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer until she could have it.Even with just that one simple word, \u2018anything\u2019, Lortel\u2019s girlish imagination began to spread its wings.\u2018Really\u2026 If I can\u2026 Then I\u2019ll do this\u2026 And this\u2026\u2019While flowers began to bloom\u2026 Suddenly thinking of something else, she was able to calm herself down.She had received a piece of information that she couldn\u2019t ignore.Elte Kehelland was coming.To be honest, it wasn\u2019t all that scary. It was just a last-ditch effort before he fell into the abyss.It was a big miscalculation to think that he could use force against Lortel after hiring a few mercenaries.In the first place, there was no way that many mercenaries would be allowed to enter Silvenia Academy. Plus, Lortel\u2019s own strength wasn\u2019t weak.\u201cIf he has another plan, then\u2026 is it taking a hostage?\u201dNow that she thought of it, there was something in mind.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll treat you special just because you\u2019re loyal to that girl? Were you perhaps bewitched by that child\u2019s beautiful appearance?\u201dElte seemed to be under the misunderstanding that Ed had taken a major liking to Lortel.The reality was quite the opposite, but either way, they had both shown support for each other through a crisis. It was enough proof to be considered a trustworthy relationship.If it wasn\u2019t about Lortel, who was always protected by her own store\u2019s escorts and whose strength wasn\u2019t weak\u2026 but instead Ed, then the story was different.If he was seriously thinking about kidnapping Ed and using him as a bargaining chip\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s crossing the line.\u201dIn the corner of the room, sitting silently in the darkness, Lortel covered herself with her robe.* * *\u201cTa-Da! Isn\u2019t it good?\u201dI laid down for the entire day.I tried to do something, but I kept getting dizzy, so I thought that I needed to rest for a few more days.What I was most thankful for was that Yennekar had been helping me out a lot.It had been two days since I had started to recover from my exhaustion. Yennekar, who had been getting a bunch of ingredients from somewhere, had been making a lot of dishes with her proficient cooking skills.It was already quite late into the night. Maybe because it was the day before the weekend, Yennekar didn\u2019t seem to be heading back to the dormitory anytime soon, even though it was so late.The light of the campfire was chasing away the cozy darkness.The sound of the bugs, which usually buzzed excitedly at night, had died down to some extent as it fell. It was replaced with the sound of owls crying and the leaves rustling in the wind.The stew that Yennekar made was really delicious when compared to the one that Ziggs had made before.I started thinking that I really needed to learn more regarding my cooking skills, but I needed to focus on my recovery rather than my growth. With that in mind, I decided to put off on my training for now.\u201cI used to cook stew every day back in my hometown. Did you know, Ed? When I was young, I used to raise cows all the time\u2026\u201dI slowly closed my eyes as I quietly watched Yennekar sit beside the campfire, smiling as she spoke. My body was slowly starting to recover, but I hadn\u2019t regained all my energy.\u201cYou look tired, Ed.\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cYou should get some rest. Hm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry that all I can do is show you this exhausted appearance, despite you helping out so much with everything, Yennekar.\u201d\u201cHm? No, not at all. I didn\u2019t really do anything special.\u201dThings like cooking and cleaning didn\u2019t seem like difficult tasks for Yennekar.She seemed to be very skilled when it came to helping sick people and taking care of them. She had said that her father, who worked on the farm, often got hurt. She would help a lot.I started to feel my fever rising again, so I put my hand up to my head. It was quite hot. My headache and low-grade fever seemed to be coming back again as I let out a sigh.After entering the cabin, I laid down on the bed as Yennekar, for some reason, followed. She sat down in the corner of the cabin, smiling and giggling.\u201c\u2026 What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything, though?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do anything?\u201d\u201cI'm just going to stay next to you.\u201dAs I looked at her in disbelief, she responded.\u201cEd, I know you\u2019re having a tough time. It\u2019s the same for anyone when their body and heart becomes tired. I know that you have been working hard and living through a more difficult lifestyle than anyone else. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have to pretend that you\u2019re not having a tough time.\u201dClearing her throat with a smile on her face, she puffed up her chest\u2014as if she was telling me to compliment her.\u201cWhat does that have to do with you sitting here doing nothing?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much strength I\u2019m giving you just by being by your side, not doing anything? It must be because you haven\u2019t experienced it!\u201dThen she looked down as she began to speak in a softer voice.\u201cThere have been lots of challenging times for me, too. I received a lot of consolation, and there were also many people who helped me, but\u2026 the thing that gave me the most strength was when someone didn\u2019t try to hastily comfort me. They just stood by me without saying a word. As it helped me, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s going to help you, Ed. Just try dealing with it!\u201dAfter saying that, Yennekar came up near the bed I was lying in\u2026 she leaned back against the bed frame as she calmly sat down. I was worried that the floor might be cold, but as it wasn\u2019t quite winter yet, it didn\u2019t seem to be all that cold.To me, it didn\u2019t look all that great. I was lying down in the bed while she sat on the floor, but Yennekar didn't seem to mind at all.\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot, hm? You did an excellent job.\u201dHowever, with her eyes closed she kept on smiling.\u201cNo\u2026 You don\u2019t have to do that\u2026\u201d\u201cHmpf!\u201dSeeing her get angry, she looked cute rather than aggressive, so it wouldn\u2019t have been weird at all if I had let out a laugh.\u201cIt was difficult! You have to admit it so you can finally get some decent rest! Admit it! Ed, you\u2019ve had a tough time!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSitting up and leaning back, I slowly lowered my voice.It might have been because I couldn\u2019t admit it easily, but I turned my eyes away.\u201cYeah\u2026 It\u2019s been hard.\u201dI\u2019d lived the entirety of my previous semester, and another half, by dividing up the hours. I couldn\u2019t even remember a day that I wasn\u2019t tired.\u201cIt was really hard for me. Really.\u201dI felt as if I could finally get a good night\u2019s sleep as I slowly let my body be overtaken by drowsiness.***After falling asleep for ten hours, I woke up to my body being completely back to normal.It was the first time in a long time that I felt completely recovered, even emotionally.Shortly after waking up, Yennekar came into view, bobbing her head by my knees.I couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh seeing her drooling and sleeping, completely passed out.It was an unexpected surprise.* * *\u2018The decision to sell the Sage\u2019s Seal had been made. The person in charge of Trix Hall needs to get ready to transfer the \u2018resonance ownership\u2019 over, as well as submit their report.\u2019Professor Glast was responsible for the transfer of the resonance ownership of the magic book the school used to own.In reality, most of the work was left to the library staff, all while he simply held an empty title.However, for a transfer of that scale, the person in charge had to personally step in and take care of certain matters themselves.\u201cProfessor Glast! The staff member in charge is looking for the seal!\u201dAssistant Professor Cleoh burst through the door of Professor Glast\u2019s\u2019 office.What she saw was Professor Glast sitting still in the faculty seat, staring out the large window.Professor Glast\u2019s desk was already piled high with various reports regarding the sale of the seal.\u201cWhat, you\u2019ve already received the reports? Then I\u2019ll go ahead and process the paperwork and report it to the school\u2026\u201dCleoh, who had noticed that Professor Glast was not responding, tried calling out his name once more.Professor Glast continued to sit still, staring out the window.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since it was a holiday, I could be a bit more relaxed.My body felt refreshed. From the moment I got out of bed, I noticed that my body was back in perfect condition.Health really was so strange, as you didn\u2019t even feel the weight of its importance until you were already sick. I really needed to start taking good care of my body and stop pushing myself. I couldn\u2019t get sick like that again.I picked up the passed out Yennekar and I laid her on top of the bed. Then I went out to the stream to wash my face with cool water. While I was there, I decided to check my stats and found that, compared to Taylee\u2019s early-mid core stats, mine were also keeping pace.Simply put, it would become harder to keep up with Taylee as his growth rapidly changed in the second half\u2026 But at least I was able to raise my core stats as much as I could.That was just how much my stats\u2019 growth had plateaued. Whether it was skill proficiency or core stats, I knew that my growth would slow down once I passed level 10. Though, I did still feel a bit frustrated seeing the way the growth rate declined.From that point on, each time I raised my stats I would definitely feel the effect. Rather than blindly training without any results, I needed to come up with more of a systematic plan.\u201cCome to think of it\u2026 I\u2019ve barely done any research on the magically engineered items.\u201d[ Life Skills Details ]Grade: Intermediate CraftsmenSpecialized Fields: WoodworkingHandicraft Lvl 14Design Lvl 10Collecting Skills Lvl 13Woodworking Lvl 13Stonemason Lvl 6Hunting Lvl 10Fishing Lvl 7Cooking Lvl 6Repairing Lvl 5< Advanced Production Technique Slot: Spiritual Infusion>Technical Proficiency: 2Power Amplification: 3Infusion Success Rate: 91Fire-related Spiritual Proficiency: 4Wind-related Spiritual Proficiency: 2Contracted Spirit: Low-Ranking Fire Spirit MuggSpiritual Resonance Level: 12Spiritual Understanding Level: 12Unique Skills: Blessing of Fire Fortune, Explosion< Advanced Production Technique Slot: Magic Engineering>Technical Proficiency: 2Magic Engineering Understanding: 3Fast Production: 3Collected Production Formulas:Weak Wind Generator: Lvl 1Loud Noise Generator: Lvl 1Automatic Resonance Magic Power Chessboard: Lvl 1??? ????? (Analyzing)?? ??? (Analyzing)Advanced Production Techniques had a major impact on core stats, and were also very versatile, so it couldn\u2019t simply be compared to a regular skill.However, as useful as it was, training it was difficult.It would have been nice if I could just use spiritual injection like a factory, constantly pumping them out. However, for each spirit that used spiritual injection, there was a certain recovery period that was needed before you could do the next one. It was like a cooldown timer.Magic Engineering, on the other hand, could be trained freely\u2014as long as you have the conditions for it. Preparing the right conditions was quite difficult.Just by researching the already completed magically engineered items, I was able to gain some proficiency in the skill. If I was lucky, I could also resemble the items. That would teach me the production method, as well.However, it was standard that, for most magically engineered items, you actually needed to acquire the production method itself. The efficiency of doing so was also better.The problem was that production formulas for magically engineered items mostly came as rewards in the main storyline quests. That meant it would be difficult for me to get my hands on them.\u201cShould I ask Taylee\u2026? There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll give them to me\u2026 No, he can\u2019t in the first place.\u201dI sat on a flat rock by the stream as I got lost in my thoughts. The production formulas for the magically engineered items were \u2018knowledge\u2019, rather than physical objects.Since Taylee didn\u2019t have any particular intention or reason to train his Magic Engineering, it seemed like a waste.If that was the case, then\u2026 As the main storyline progressed, wouldn\u2019t it be fine for me to take care of the scroll-type production formulas that dropped?Taylee wasn\u2019t going to train in Magic Engineering anyway, so the magic engineering production formulas wouldn\u2019t be anything more than pieces of paper to him. There was also a high chance that he just wouldn\u2019t even take them.Techniques were like goldmines to me. Once I graduated from Silvenia and started living on my own, it would be immensely helpful in making a living if I was able to train a reliable skill like Magic Engineering to its limit.In fact, I was even well-informed of where and what ways the important production formulas were dropped or hidden. If I could catch and get a hold of them, it would greatly help my skill proficiency.Teaching myself by repeatedly disassembling, analyzing, and then reassembling the products Lortel managed to supply me with clearly had a limit in terms of my growth.I was starting to feel the importance of securing efficient, useful, and expensive magic engineering production formulas.\u201cHmm\u2026 Come to think of it, it\u2019s almost the end of Act 2. I\u2019ve been training out of my mind, not to mention the fact that I was unconscious for ten days, so it\u2019s gone by in an instant.\u201dIn the middle of the tranquil forest, right at daybreak, I gazed up at the sky.It was a peaceful sight to look at. But when I closed my eyes, I could imagine the scene of the tower of magic power. It engulfed the entire sky over the school, and Glast had imbued it with Celestial Magic.Using high-ranking time-related magic, creating and using all kinds of golems and experimented monsters, and even using his own disciples and other academic staff members as shields\u2026 He was a madman scholar that had finally gained resonance with the Sage\u2019s Seal.The final chapter of Act 2, The Glast Subjugation.Thinking that far, the memory of his research room flashed across my mind.\u201cThe Soul Library\u2026!\u201dI clenched my fist and nodded my head.There were four stages of battle in the final chapter.A detour to the teacher\u2019s district, the underground waterways, Glast\u2019s secret research room, and the top of the tower of magic power.Among them, Glast\u2019s secret research room was notorious for being long and difficult, but it also had the Soul Library\u2014which had a collection of all sorts of valuable magic books, references, and priceless magic documents.It was a stage where you had to run around and catch the librarian, who would fly through the plentiful bookshelves and magic books. The stage\u2019s boss, the librarian of the Soul Library Raina, was hard to defeat without the use of the Swordmaster's Skill.Well, even though things were like that, Taylee's present specs should have been high enough to defeat her. I\u2019d already asked around for information, so I was sure he was fine. My interests were in a different area\u2014the contents of the Soul Library.It was full of valuable Magic Engineering production formulas. As far as I could remember, the number of them was in double digits. Plus, there were two in particular that could produce legendary grade magically engineered items.If it was a magically engineered item of a legendary grade, as long as you can get the materials to make it, it could be a lethal weapon close to the level of the Swordmaster's Skill.It might not be able to keep up with the uniqueness of the Swordmaster's Skill, which was effective when fighting against particular storyline bosses, but the sheer firepower of a weapon at that level couldn\u2019t be easily ignored.I searched through my memory carefully.\u2018Glockt\u2019s Eyes\u2019 temporarily amplified your innate amount of magic power and all resonance-related skills\u2019 proficiency.\u2018Dell Heim\u2019s Sandglass\u2019 reverted all physical conditions back a few seconds.\u2018Glockt\u2019s Eyes\u2019\u2026 If I could use that, I'd be able to temporarily amplify my Spiritual Resonance. That would allow me to make a contract with a high-ranking spirit, which I normally wouldn\u2019t be able to do at my level.\u2018Dell Heim\u2019s Sandglass\u2019\u2026 There was a high possibility that it would be the key to saving my life at least once in a desperate situation.Those\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just ignore them.\u201cI can\u2019t let this golden opportunity slip through my fingers\u2026\u201dThe advanced production techniques for magic engineering had a uniquely designed balance to them.As for grant-type skills such as Spiritual Infusion and Enchant\u2026 you could only be granted those advanced skills once your body raised its proficiency and mana resonance to a high enough level.However, for production-type skills like Magic Engineering\u2026 it was balanced by \u2018the rareness of materials.\u2019In other words, no matter what type of advanced production formula I got my hands on, if I couldn\u2019t get the materials for it I wouldn\u2019t be able to utilize the power of an advanced magically engineered item.No matter how early you obtained a legendary type production skill, it wouldn\u2019t mean much if you could only obtain the items in the latter half of the storyline.That meant that the system was designed to prevent players from making excessively strong magically engineered items at the current point in the storyline\u2026 Luckily for me, though, I had a friend that could give me a \u2018chance.\u2019She was a main character in the storyline, one who I\u2019d been trying not to get close to as much as possible. However, she could get any material she wanted, even if it was on the other side of the map.I didn\u2019t know what she would ask for in return, but the fact that I had a source in the first place was the important part. If all went well, I\u2019d be able to work with a level of magically engineered items that shouldn\u2019t even exist in the current ongoing storyline.\u201cJust what are you thinking so hard about?\u201dAs I turned around, trembling, I saw a girl with reddish-brown hair sitting on a fallen tree.I thought she had said that braiding her hair over one shoulder was more comfortable, but I\u2019d been seeing her with her hair unbound or neatly combed recently. I thought her hair was always braided when she was working.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure, but you showed up right away.\u201d\u201cOh my, have you been thinking about me this early in the morning? I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201dSeeing her smile, she looked more like a girl her age than a merchant. But that quiet voice of hers and insidious smile made me rethink that.\u201cDon\u2019t you know? Many a little makes a mickle. Something that starts off small will build up into something bigger. If you want to get rid of me, you will have to try harder~\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t even realize you were nearby. When did you get here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a secret. It\u2019s been quite a while.\u201dLortel jumped off the fallen tree, trying to catch her balance.\u201cI\u2019ve been so busy that I haven\u2019t been able to see you lately. At that rate, I thought I might have forgotten what you look like. It would have been great if you had the sense to visit my store.\u201d\u201cYou already knew about my situation. Well\u2026 Thanks for the furniture.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dLortel strode up to me with a coy expression, grabbing my shoulder and lightly pushing me. She made me sit back down on the rock. Then, after looking me up and down with a sour expression, she let out a deep sigh.\u201cI\u2019m relieved to see that your condition has returned to normal. I was so surprised by it all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a relief to see that you look healthy.\u201d\u201cDo I look healthy? I\u2019m already suffering from chronic fatigue. My hair has become all frizzy, and I\u2019ve gone through so much to stop my face from getting puffy. There are so many things I need to deal with, and I also have to head back and take care of my schoolwork.\u201d\u201cEven though you\u2019re so busy, you came all the way to the northern forest?\u201d\u201cWell, I need to rest when I can. Also, I have something I need to tell you.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *After saying that, Lortel pushed on my waist. She was trying to tell me to make some room, since the rock was so small. Moving my butt over, I made some room for her to sit. Sitting down gently, she looked at me with a satisfied smile.\u201cIt\u2019s about what Ziggs told me. How if I bought the Sage\u2019s Seal and showed it to you, you would do anything I ask.\u201dI took a deep breath.It was an urgent situation. Even though I needed to keep Krepin in check immediately, since I had overworked myself by passing out, I had no choice but to take care of it in any way possible. And this was the result.\u201cOnce my father\u2019s dismissal is completed and the transfer of power from the head seat is finished, the Elte Company is planning to change its name. Wouldn\u2019t it be sort of weird to call it the Elte Company when Elte has been dismissed?\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWe are planning on completely reorganizing the company's structure. Until then, I\u2019m thinking that we will get rid of the name \u2018Elte Company\u2019 and use a simple name like \u2018Top Class\u2019 instead. There\u2019s going to be many personnel changes, and in the process my authority and influence will definitely become stronger.\u201dFrom just that much, I could get a rough idea of what Lortel was trying to say.It was a specific type of kidnapping called \u2018Scouting\u2019.\u201cOnce the business branch's restructuring is complete, we will need a lot of new hands-on staff. It will be a pretty high up position, too. From employee management, asset management, sales flow, and even external affairs, you will oversee nearly everything\u2026 You will practically be one of the few people at the top with major authority.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cImagine that. When we wake up in the morning and go to work in the company\u2019s building, there will only be a single wall between us. How great of a deal is that? As I was one of the people with authority back when it was the Elte Company, I\u2019ll still have a decent share of personal assets that I will share with you. We will be just like a married couple\u2026 Oh my, why do I keep running my mouth and saying such nonsense? Hahahaha.\u201dBy the middle of her speech, I could feel Lortel getting carried away in her excitement. She was usually so calm and collected, but she was so excited that she was talking rather quickly.Seeing her smile, it didn\u2019t match that insidious smile that I had seen earlier\u2026 I was confused as to what rhythm she wanted me to dance at.\u201cWe will occasionally see each other at work, and we will exchange glances and greet each other. When we go to the front together, we might have challenging times, and even be suspicious of each other, but\u2026 They say that the ground will harden even after it rains, right? As long as we have each other\u2019s back as we develop the company, eventually the sun will rise again\u2026 As we slowly age, we will also become much more skilled in managing the company. So even though we made a lot of enemies on the way, at least we will be strong allies to each other\u2026 Ed, I\u2019ve seen you be quick-witted, intuitive, and you also seem to have good sense when it comes to bookkeeping and personal management. You will definitely be an amazing merchant\u2026\u201d\u201cLortel.\u201dShe was going to give me a key corporate position at her company, share some of her private assets with me, and even my living conditions would improve greatly.It was a mouthwatering offer. But there were many reasons why I would have to swallow my spit.Needless to say, the events that would take place in Silvenia would ultimately also affect the world.I couldn\u2019t rely on the temporary emotions and skill set of a successful merchant like Lortel, or invest my entire life in such a risky job.Above all else, Lortel\u2019s behavior was completely irrational, unlike her usual self.\u201cGoing this far just for me\u2026 It\u2019s too strange.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCalmly bringing up the reality of it all, as if she realized it herself, Lortel got rid of her disgraceful appearance.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI know how you are feeling, Ed. \u2018Just what is wrong with that girl?\u2019 You can't agree to such a major deal based on a little girl\u2019s momentary feelings. That must be what you're thinking. I\u2019m sure that you just want to keep a business relationship with me, up until the very end.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how people usually feel. But there is something that you don\u2019t know.\u201dLortel lowered her shoulders as she continued to speak in a dispirited voice.\u201cDo you know what you start craving the most in the world of business? Do you know what the most important thing is when living in a world where every little gesture, or every slight breath you take, changes the entire flow of hundreds of gold coins? One where, if you don\u2019t stab someone else in the back first, you will be the victim?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cA person that will never betray you. Even if everyone else in the world turns their back on you, a person that will always stay by your side. A person that, if you wake up one day and all the money you\u2019ve saved up vanishes, will stand by you.\u201dTo some, it might be their family. To others, perhaps a lover. Or maybe it was an ally that had been by their side for decades.Even though her life had been short thus far, Lortel must have witnessed the rise and fall of some of the greatest merchants of all time.As was often the case for those who lived a life blinded by greed, she must have always been alone and miserable.The fact that she might one day be the one that falls\u2026 That fear would always live deep inside the hearts of those who stood on top.There was no way for her to know if the people around her were looking at her for who she was, or if they were looking at the tower of gold coins under her feet.That was why, if you needed that sort of relationship, you would have no choice but to make it yourself.\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to get such a person. Looking past their interests, all you can do is share each other's feelings and help one another.\u201dIt was nothing special and nothing all that great.It might be in line with buying a meal for a friend who didn\u2019t look like they were in a great spot.It was common in a person\u2019s social life for someone that helped you when you were having a tough time to later develop into a better and closer companion.People who trusted each other in hardships would never betray each other. Maybe her story was something like that.However, Lortel\u2019s actions showed a different type of urgency.Lortel, who lifted both her hands to hold my right hand in between hers, spoke with a weakened face.\u201cNothing more and nothing less. Can\u2019t you please just stay by my side?\u201d\u201cLortel\u2026\u201dThen, I eventually said it.\u201c\u2026 First, stop laughing. Then you can try asking me again.\u201d\u201cAhh! You didn\u2019t fall for it!\u201dLortel burst into laughter as she put down her clasped hands, leaning back.Seeing her come back to her usual self, she was like a fox wagging her tail.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad! I almost had you!\u201d\u201cYour voice was getting too excited in the middle of your speech, you little\u2014!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only human, so I couldn\u2019t help but get a little excited. How was it, though? Did it trigger your protective instinct at all? Usually, by showing someone my vulnerable side like that, their heart would begin to tremble.\u201d\u201cWell, it did wake me up.\u201d\u201cEhhh, what a shame. Though, still\u2026\u201dLortel lowered her head as she added on something else.\u201cNot everything I said was a lie.\u201dThere was a long moment of silence. For a while, I stayed completely still, listening to the rustling of the leaves and the flowing stream.Surprised by the sudden silence, I turned my head to try and look at Lortel. For some reason, she had lowered her head even further, hiding her expression underneath her hood.I couldn\u2019t guess the reason at all; whether she was embarrassed, regretful, happy, or sad.\u201cI\u2019m planning on graduating from Silvenia. Until then, I don\u2019t have any intention of leaving school.\u201dI could list many reasons.There were all the disasters that would take place at Silvenia. That was the most important reason.It was also the only place that I could use my future knowledge. That means that, at least until I graduated, there was no better place than the school for me to efficiently develop my growth.Other than that\u2026 It was to lay the groundwork for surviving alone in the world, without having to rely on anyone else. Plus, I didn\u2019t want the time and money I spent already to go to waste.\u201cAs for what I\u2019m going to do after graduating\u2026 I haven\u2019t decided that yet.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess you could just wait until graduation. But Ed. Did you know? You don\u2019t have a choice in the first place?\u201dLortel smiled as she took out a piece rolled up parchment from her pocket, then she pressed it against my chest.Accepting it, I unrolled it to see\u2026 The certificate of sale for the Sage\u2019s Seal.When I looked up, Lortel had moved far away before I had even realized it. I couldn\u2019t see her expression well because of the robe, but hearing the tone of her voice, she must have had a wide smile on her face.\u201cIt was nice to see you again after such a long time. I\u2019ll come back with my free pass soon.\u201dUnfortunately, it was my victory.Completely certain about the turn of events, Lortel trotted off and disappeared into the woods. Only then did that appearance of the rare, one-of-a-kind female merchant finally return.I sat by the stream, scratching my chin a few times.Thinking about what was going to happen later\u2026 I felt like I had done a really terrible thing to Lortel.From Lortel\u2019s point of view, I didn\u2019t think she would have figured it out yet, but\u2026But still\u2026 I felt like it left a debt on my heart\u2026***\u2018That was dangerous\u2026!\u2019Lortel was already out of her mind, fighting back the smile that threatened to cross her face.After suffering through a heavy workload, she came to see Ed\u2019s face for healing. However, halfway through she had to put all her concentration and thought into maintaining her facial expressions.Originally, she had planned to approach him calmly and show him the certificate of sale. She planned to declare \u2018you\u2019re mine, now\u2019, and end it there. But when she saw Ed contemplating in the early morning sun, her plan was disrupted.Either way, she ended up speaking nonsense, and went completely off track from her original plan, but\u2026 It was a relief that her foxlike merchant persona seemed to be well maintained. If she had left even a bit later, surely her true expression would have been exposed.\u2018I couldn\u2019t even give him his change\u2026!\u2019Most of the money Ed had was in gold coins.The price of the magically engineered items he\u2019d bought from Lortel for cheap were for paid using a single gold coin. Lortel had put the change in her leather bag before coming.Since she didn\u2019t know when she would be able to visit the camp again, she felt uneasy pushing it back any further.That being said, she didn\u2019t have the confidence to see Ed\u2019s face again. Instead, she went behind the stream and headed back towards Ed\u2019s camp. As long as she threw it somewhere near his cabin, Ed would be able to find it and take care of it.The distance between the stream and the camp wasn\u2019t that far. Lortel was going to stop by quickly and place the leather bag near the campfire in the middle of the camp, where he could clearly find it.Thud!At that moment, the door of the cabin opened.Yennekar walked out holding onto Ed\u2019s pillow, yawning with messy hair.\u201cYaaawn\u2026\u00a0 Ed\u2026 went to the stream.\u201dYennekar had seen Ed go out towards the stream while she was pretending to be asleep. She hadn\u2019t slept because of the exhaustion that was flooding her body and the nervousness from spending a night in the same room as Ed, so she had pretended to sleep without saying anything\u2026 But she actually ended up falling asleep like the innocent girl she was.\u201cBefore I head back, I should at least eat something simple\u2026\u201dRubbing her eyes as her vision started to come back, she made eye contact with Lortel, who was coming from the stream.Seeing each other\u2019s faces was a disaster in their eyes.\u201cWhy are you coming out of there, Yennekar\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy are you coming from the stream, Lortel\u2026?\u201dIt was also the beginning of a new disaster for Ed.* * *\u203b\u00a0The article you\u2019re reading is PepperoPepe\u2019s \u2018How to attack the Act 2 Boss for beginners, briefly focusing on the main points! (http://sihtdaerotevahtnoduoy.co.kr/memopad=11231)\u00a0A summary of basic information and strategies.\u203b\u00a0Please refer to the original article for detailed strategic information!2-11; Act 2, Final ChapterBoss: Inquirer Glast (Seeker of Truth)\u25a0 Phase 1. Chasing GlastAchievement Condition: Chase after senior professor Glast, who is fleeing from Trix Hall after kidnapping Ayla!(Conditions for additional achievements.) Have \u2018The Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019 join you.(Conditions for additional achievements.) Have \u2018Romantic Adele\u2019 join you.(Conditions for additional achievements.) Have \u2018Gloomy Clevius\u2019 join you.(Conditions for additional achievements.) Have \u2018Nosy Elvira\u2019 join you.Enemies:Low-Rank Magic Golem* 50Mid-Rank Magic Golem* 10Head Researcher Melverick* 1Student President Verus *1Lazy Lucy *1\u203b\u00a0Once you\u2019ve met the specific conditions, your colleagues will join you in rescuing Ayla partway through.\u2018Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019: During Act 2, Chapter 7 \u2018Devil of the Underground Waterways\u2019, tell him the story about Ayla\u2019s pendant.\u2018Romantic Adele\u2019: When asked about Ayla\u2019s Magic Power Resonance, you answered honestly.\u2018Gloomy Clevius\u2019: During Act 2, Chapter 3 \u2018The Occupation of Ophelis Hall\u2019, Clevius is slapped and reprimanded by Ayla.\u2018Nosy Elvira\u2019: During Act 2, Chapter 5 \u2018Exploring the Alchemy Department\u2019s Society\u2019, losing the debate with Ayla.\u203b\u00a0The Magic Golem is barely affected by magic power. It is easier to use physical strength to break through, incompatible magically engineered items, or modified alchemy reagents to neutralize it.\u203b\u00a0You can skip over the head researcher Melverick, who appears midway through the chase, by taking a detour. If you don't need a particular achievement or skill proficiency related to Magic Engineering, take the detour to save supplies.\u203b\u00a0The student president Verus\u2019 swordsmanship can invalidate nearly all blocking-related skills. If it\u2019s difficult to quickly dodge her attacks, it is okay to just use Swordmaster's Skill one time. However, if you have used it once during the battle with Verus, make sure to avoid using it again until right before the boss.\u203b\u00a0If certain conditions are met, Lazy Lucy will appear as a hostile enemy. Make sure to avoid it as a bad ending is inevitable. The pre-conditions that are necessary are quite complicated, so it\u2019s an event that rarely occurs. But if your goal is to complete a certain achievement, please refer to the original article for the detailed conditions!\u25a0 Phase 2. Chasing Glast 2Achievement Objective: Continue chasing after senior professor Glast, who has now hidden in the underground waterways!Enemies:Low-Rank Magic Golem* 70Mid-Rank Magic Golem* 30High-Rank Magic Golem Hayton* 1Third year top alchemy student, Dorothy *1Assistant Professor Cleoh Elpin *1\u203b\u00a0The High-Rank Magic Golem Hayton is resistant to most attacks. Use the Swordmaster's Skill to defeat it or buy enough time for the event where the entrance to the underground waterways collapses. (Don\u2019t waste any of your consumables!)\u203b\u00a0You can\u2019t see the map while in the underground waterways. If it\u2019s too difficult to remember the correct path, put your hand against the left wall and keep walking until you reach the entrance to the secret research room.\u203b\u00a0Through a dialogue choice, you can skip the battle against Dorothy. Each time the option will be different, but if you express the fact that she\u2019s being deceived by Professor Glast as much as possible, it will work.If combat begins, fight her in the same method as you dealt with the Act 1 mid-boss Elvira. You can quickly and easily clear the battle if you are careful about your distance while she is throwing reagents.\u203b\u00a0There is not much direct combat with Assistant Professor Cleoh Elpin. If you destroy the shield she created with beginner magic, a cut scene will occur and you can move on to the next phase.\u25a0 Phase 3. Searching Through the Secret Research RoomAchievement Objective: Advance to the deepest parts of the secret research room!Enemies:Alive and Moving Dolls* 80Magic books with souls *440Floating Bookshelves* 30Soul Library Librarian, Reina* 1Escaped Subjects* 30Blue-blooded Kobold* 40Gremlins with wings cut off* 10Distorted Vampire Bat* 40Celestial Researcher Koom* 1Revived Devil of the Underground Waterways* 1\u203b\u00a0This is a tricky phase. The number of enemies are high, and they are all quite powerful. Gather your senses and handle it properly!\u203b\u00a0The order follows first the Soul Library - Monster Research Room - the central hallway. If the order is messed up you will need to do it again, so please take notice.\u203b\u00a0Enemies that appear as Souls barely take any damage from physical attacks. However, if \u2018Romantic Adele\u2019 joins the subjugation team she will be able to cast soul-fixing magic, allowing you to inflict physical damage. It\u2019s very convenient to have, so make sure to bring her along.\u203b\u00a0The Soul-type magic used by the librarian Reina reduces your mental strength and restrains the flow of your magic power. You will also periodically fall victim to hallucinations, so be careful to not accidentally attack a member of the subjugation team. If you are in a state of hallucination, it\u2019s better to just focus on avoiding attacks.\u203b\u00a0Celestial Researcher Koom uses beginner level Celestial Magic. He\u2019s immune to all forms of attacks and his magic attacking strength is very high, though he doesn\u2019t move locations.If you steadily keep lowering the number of monster subjects that he is summoning, eventually Koom\u2019s Celestial magic circle will run wild, causing him to self-destruct. Don\u2019t waste any consumables here unnecessarily.\u203b\u00a0The attack pattern of the revived devil of the underground waterways is nearly identical to the one you faced in Act 2, Chapter 7. However, as its body has become much bigger and the number of arms has increased, it is more difficult. Its range of attack is much larger, and the arm attached to its shoulder is able to cover its weak spot behind on its\u2019 back, so you will have to face it with standard tactics.Try to block as many attacks as you can, then attack it with full strength. If you have failed to acquire the appropriate clear specs, you will get stuck here. Make sure to check the level of your specs.\u25a0 Phase 4. Advancing to the Tower of Magic PowerAchievement Objective: Attack Glast, who is resonating with the Sage\u2019s Seal at the top of the tower of magic power.Enemies:Wandering Skeletons* 30Magic Powered Guardian Golems *20Cyclops* 1The Golden Daughter, Lortel* 1\u203b\u00a0You just need to deal with the enemies that appear while taking a straight path up the tower of magic power.\u203b\u00a0Note that some of the wandering skeletons shoot arrows. Also, deal with the elite monsters wearing armor first.\u203b\u00a0Due to its massive size, the Cyclops will move very slowly. However, if it hits you even once you will die. If you have brought along \u2018The Spear from Nature Ziggs\u2019, he will take the position of vanguard, making it very easy to clear.\u203b\u00a0The battle against Lortel can be skipped by picking the appropriate option. After the subjugation, if you promise to hand over the ownership of the Sage\u2019s Seal to her the battle will not continue. However, if the seal is damaged in a later battle, the Sage\u2019s Seal will disappear from the clear rewards.If you are careful of her intermediate ice magic, it will be much easier than you think to defeat her. So don\u2019t unnecessarily sacrifice the reward and continue with the battle.\u25a0 Phase 5. The Glast SubjugationAchievement Objective: Subjugate Glast!Appearing Enemies:Inquirer Glast* 1\u203b\u00a0He uses lots of tricky Celestial Magic and carries many magically engineered items. Listing the unique things to be wary of:Miniature Time Reversal: Temporarily recovers all wounds and sends out an attack, fainting the entire battlefield.Time Prison: At the start of the battle half of the subjugation members will be trapped in a time prison, unable to move. Until Glast\u2019s vitality reaches the halfway point, they will remain detained.Reinforced Claw Fingers: A magically engineered item that pushes back the vanguard of the subjugation team, giving him an advantageous position. It\u2019s usually used with elemental magic, so make sure to fix the battle formation quickly.Shock-Enhanced Wave Ball: If you are hit at close range, you will immediately fall off the tower of magic power. Always make sure to keep your distance from it.In addition, he regularly summons golems and monster experiments, as well as using magic common amongst other enemy magicians like elemental magic, spirit-type magic, and spatial magic. Please refer to the original version for information regarding the attacks of each phase.\u25a0 Etc.At the end of the time limit, Ayla will die, resulting in a bad ending. Make sure to move quickly.Throughout the storyline, try and sufficiently raise the proficiency of the Swordmaster's Skill up to 4 or 5. It\u2019s a skill that is necessary to be proficient in when facing off against the Act 3 and Act 4 bosses.This is an important act that lays the key foundation for the future storyline. It\u2019s better to play through it without skipping as much as possible.* * *I sat alone by the stream, looking towards the slowly rising sun. With this newly refreshed body, I was encouraged to get started on some work.I slowly stood up and turned around.I remembered the three letters that I received before I collapsed from overworking.One was a letter from Lortel, which contained a message to take care of myself, as Elte\u2019s movements were suspicious.Another was a personal letter from Princess Penia, who was trying to summon me for information regarding the Rothstaylor Family, since Krepin\u2019s movements were suspicious.And the last letter had come from the school. The person who had sent it to me was completely unexpected.The senior professor in charge of the first years, Glast.It was a message saying that he wanted to meet with me personally after the academy's scheduled training at the end of the month.Sadly, as I was still unconscious during that time, I couldn\u2019t go see him.There\u2019s no way for me to know why he had called on me, or what he had wanted to discuss.Act 2 was now coming to its final stage, and his story was reaching its end as well.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Glast Subjugation (1)Lucy always laid down facing the stars.Laying down on the rooftop of Trix Hall, looking up at the sky, the twinkling starry night high above her and pressing down like a comfortable blanket\u2026The heat and cold weren\u2019t particularly important factors for Lucy, as she wore various protective magics over herself. However, being in the sunlight, having a good view of the open sky, and hearing the occasional rattling of the leaves or the flowing of the stream were more important to her than you would think.On the other hand, being completely blocked in by walls and ceilings wasn't good.That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t like Ophelis Hall, despite the well-lit, sunny rooms, the expensive beds, and the high-class bedding.Even though the maids were neck-deep in work because of the half-destroyed Ophelis Hall, the maids still didn\u2019t slack when it came to keeping tabs on Lucy.Every day, they made sure Lucy wore her freshly cleaned uniform properly and neatly as they gently combed her white hair, which tended to fly all over the place. Even then, her behavior was still no different than that of a stray cat on the street.\u2018There is no end when it comes to learning, Lucy. I\u2019m sure that Mr. Silvenia must have also thought the same thing.\u2019That old man.The worn-out wizard hat full of creases\u2014originally worn by the magician Glockt before he gave it to her\u2014held the fragrant scent of rosemary. Sniffing the sleeves of her clothes, she could smell the same scent. While Lucy was sleeping, the maid\u2019s continued to do the laundry as they saw fit.Suddenly, she remembered the day Glockt passed away. A day where the rain poured down heavily.The memory of the time she sat down in Glockt\u2019s cabin, holding onto his hat as she blew away all those who approached him, felt so far off and distant\u2014like the starry sky. She even attacked those who tried to touch the archmage Glockt\u2019s corpse as they pleased.Compared to that time, had she become gentler?Though, compared to back then she hadn\u2019t exactly become any more dependable. Rather, it was more appropriate to say that she had become lazier. Aside from the maids, there was no one left to discipline Lucy.If you were to ask if her life had gotten boring, she wouldn\u2019t think so.Even on the rather confined Acken Island, there was a surprising number of beautifully scenic views, delicious food to eat, and many crazy events.Most of the time, Lucy\u2014who was distant because of the hardships she had experienced in her life\u2014found none of it interesting. Either way, it didn\u2019t seem as if her life was particularly boring.\u2018You may have been born with the natural gift of talent and the blessing of the stars, but that's no excuse to stop learning, Lucy. Even if everyone in the land of learning is beneath your talent, there must definitely still be something there for you to learn. That\u2019s why you must always be learning. Be humble and use your power for the sake of everyone.\u2019\u2018And\u2026 Be careful of the loneliness that will one day slowly creep up on you. With the strength to defeat everyone else, it is bound to be accompanied by a bitter loneliness\u2026 Lucy, I am sorry that I am leaving you first.\u2019The form that loneliness takes differs from one person to another. The cold blade of loneliness would eventually find everyone, in some way or another.But Lucy was still too young to understand that fact. Even now, that fact still hadn\u2019t touched her heart.That tingling feeling inside of her was closer to longing than loneliness.He was like an old man that would nag her all day long. Whenever she was asleep out on the outskirts of the magic forest, he would lift her up and throw her aside, always getting angry while scolding her. Though, now that he was gone there was a strange feeling of emptiness left in his place.They would probably never see each other again.There was a time where a part of her heart suffered from that fact, but as time passed the pain of that wound slowly began to fade away.Now, the satisfaction of just having a bag of jerky in her arms was enough to hold off that feeling of longing.\u2018That\u2019s very much like you\u2014\u2019It was funny, thinking of what Glockt\u2019s\u2019 expression might be if he saw what she was up to now.Though what was lost, was lost. She has had enough experience to know that trying to get it back would just be a waste of energy.All she had to do now was stare up at the starry sky and be lucky enough to enjoy her time.There wasn\u2019t much else to do, either. The lessons in class were too easy. She could memorize the contents of a book just by quickly skimming through it. Practical class also required no more than a flick of her finger. The Glockt Scholarship Foundation was fully taking care of her tuition. And the professors didn\u2019t particularly bother her.One day, she remembered his wrinkly old hands that used to pat Lucy on top of her head.At some point in time, the feeling of missing Glockt had become as natural as the first time she had felt comfortable with him.For Lucy, the feeling of leaning on someone and beginning to miss them had come so naturally.Even though it was annoying and frustrating, she was someone who would one day feel suddenly empty, realizing that there was no one around her.After realizing what longing truly was, she didn\u2019t want to make any more relationships of that type.It was a feeling that the young genius magician never wanted to experience again. Thus, she had become detached from the world, and by the time she came back to her senses she had already become extremely lazy. In a way, she was living quite a ridiculous life.She knew well that, when the day came that her fate caught up to her, she would still have to get up even if it was annoying.However, it wasn\u2019t yet that time.Lucy swung her feet off the dangerous handrails on the roof of Trix Hall. Just in case her hat flew away, she held it down with one hand, biting a piece of her jerky and looking up at the autumn night sky\u2026 It was quite vast and pleasant.For the time being, it seemed as if the autumn skies would stay sunny and clear. At least it wouldn\u2019t be pouring down rain.Feeling good about that fact, Lucy started to hum\u2014unusual for her.* * *Act 2\u2019s final chapter was starting.As for the other events that took place, I didn\u2019t have a choice but to hear about them from Ziggs, Yennekar, and Lortel.I didn\u2019t want to get unnecessarily close to everything, but I didn\u2019t have that type of freedom. Also, there wasn\u2019t really a good excuse or reason for me to get involved with what was going on between the main characters in the first year.As long as I could confirm the fact that the story was progressing smoothly towards the end, without any major issues, there wasn\u2019t a problem.However, the situation had changed a bit as it neared the final chapter. That was because a reason for me to get involved had appeared.If there was a magically engineered item production formula that was going to be wasted anyway, I definitely wanted to get my hands on it. That was because there was no better option when it came to creating a solid foundation for my growth. If I got lucky, maybe I\u2019d become stronger at an explosive rate.[Good work, young master Ed! Now there\u2019s no longer any issues regarding the camp\u2019s food reserve level!]\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit lacking if it\u2019s going to last me through the winter.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long to collect food, stocking up the camp\u2019s food reserve for now. In the first place, I was already somewhat used to hunting, and after raising my specs it had become a lot easier than I thought to catch wild animals.[But you can\u2019t overwork yourself! If you want to get six hours of sleep on schedule, you should slowly finish up your studies for the day. Also, you didn\u2019t eat enough meat or vegetables today, young master Ed! You need to make sure to make up for it at dinner! Also, you haven\u2019t been drinking enough water!]\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dMugg began to report on each aspect of my daily life, one by one. By that point, it felt like I had a personal secretary instead of a spirit that would enter the battlefield at my side.[If you end up fainting again, I will really die! Please make sure to live a long, healthy life for me! I really want to maintain our contract relationship for a very long time, young master Ed!]After fainting that one time, Takan seemed to have scolded Mugg heavily on what he was doing, since he was always next to my side. However, it was the same regardless of where you went\u2014the ones at the bottom were always left to take blame.I\u2019m really sorry about that, Mugg!***\u201cAfter all, people that are too nice aren\u2019t all that great. Right, Ed?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cToday, my friends fought amongst themselves, and I couldn\u2019t say a thing to them.\u201dAfter finishing up my daily schedule at school, I returned to camp with Yennekar.It started to become normal for Yennekar to return to the camp with me instead of going to Dex Hall. It was at the point where it didn\u2019t feel strange in the slightest. I started to wonder if she was even really sleeping back at Dex Hall.Thinking over how Yennekar must have felt uncomfortable at Dex Hall, it was something that I could understand. After all, I was the one who told her that she could come visit my camp whenever she wanted in the first place.Yennekar came back to my camp, automatically taking out her own mug and making some herbal tea on the table with mine.At first, it was uncomfortable to see her using the spirits to help maintain my camp sometimes or seeing her roll up her uniform sleeves to do my laundry. That was because, from my point of view, I had nothing to repay her with.She even took the time to teach me about spirit-type magic. When I asked her how I could repay her, since I didn\u2019t have anything, she had quickly waved her arms and said that it was okay. I even started to have bad thoughts, wondering if that was how a pimp felt.\u2026 Alright. Let\u2019s stop thinking such bad thoughts.\u201cClara and Anise had a fight today. You know them, right? The two friends that I am always hanging out with.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know them.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal. We were all just chatting while walking to monster ecology from elemental studies, when they suddenly started bickering over something minor, which then turned into a fight. But\u2026 Since I was in between them, they ended up feeling sorry for me.\u201d\u201cThat must have been confusing for you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 I started to feel weird when I thought about how considerate they were of me before they started fighting.\u201dYennekar grabbed her mug as she looked down at the campfire sadly.\u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s always been like that. Everyone is always so nice, kind, and considerate towards me\u2026 Even though they don\u2019t have to do it. It\u2019s like some obsession that they all have.\u201dI wouldn\u2019t deny the fact that Yennekar was well known for being a fairy in this world. But it was interesting seeing that others' consideration towards her was only making her tired.No, that wasn\u2019t it. Thinking of it as a Yennekar-type of reaction, it all started to look natural and make sense.\u201cBut if I bring it up, they will start to think I'm someone who gets annoyed easily, so I can\u2019t say it. I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll end up saying something like, \u2018Why do you feel uncomfortable when we\u2019re only being considerate towards you?\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true to some extent. You can\u2019t really be mad at them if they\u2019re just being nice and considerate towards you.\u201d\u201cUgh, Ed, your words are always so blunt. But I can\u2019t deny what you\u2019re saying, since it is the truth.\u201dLooking at Yennekar playing around with her feet with a stupid grin on her face, it definitely seemed that her feelings had changed recently.\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m going to be bad. I know I tried it several times already, but this time I\u2019m going to do it for real.\u201dSaying that, she started going into a peculiar stance. She put both of her hands on her waist as she started to act a bit sassy, like she was saying \u2018I\u2019m bad!\u2019. Honestly speaking, I had no idea what she was trying to do.\u201cCome to think of it, I had a favor to ask you.\u201d\u201cOkay! What is it?! Is it urgent?! You can tell me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter Yennekar spoke, she held her breath and put her mug down. Thinking about what she should say next, or how to say it, she suddenly began to speak slowly.\u201cIf it\u2019s a request\u2026 Then maybe I will be able to help, or maybe not\u2026 But how about you try saying it first\u2026?\u201d\u201cBut I feel really bad having to ask you for help for free. It might be very troublesome, or even dangerous. Though, I think it will all be okay somehow.\u201dAs I lowered my voice and spoke carefully, the moment Yennekar realized I was serious she changed expressions.\u201cThere are some items that I have lost, and other ones that I want to find, so there is somewhere I want to go\u2026 Though, it\u2019s somewhere that\u2019s a bit dangerous to go alone.\u201d\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cThe underground waterways. There\u2019s a big entrance on the outskirts of the teacher district that you can enter from.\u201d\u201cReally? Is that place really that dangerous? I don\u2019t really know, as I haven\u2019t been there before\u2026 But since you said it was, it must really be dangerous.\u201dI had created a plan, to a certain extent.The final chapter of Act 2 began at Trix Hall, then proceeded into the underground waterways, the secret laboratory inside of it, and finally the tower of magic power.While the protagonist Taylee began to make his move, I was thinking of grabbing all the production formulas and magic tools in the Soul Library located in the secret laboratory, then heading back out.But it would be inefficient to try and get past the secret laboratory\u2019s strict security system and all the guards. Plus, it might affect the timeline, and I wasn\u2019t even sure whether it would be possible. Even if it was possible, I didn\u2019t want to take on such a difficult job personally.So, the key to the operation had to be changed to 'following Taylee\u2019.The plan was, while Taylee cleared all the obstacles on his way to the final battle, I would carefully follow behind him and grab only what I needed before running away.\u2018The Badge of Honor\u2019 was dropped by the student president Verus in Phase 1. That accessory greatly increased magical resistance to all elemental magics\u2026 Well, it was going to be quite useful getting through future storylines, so I\u2019d let Taylee take care of that one.There wasn\u2019t much reason to take any of the magically engineered items dropped by Assistant Professor Cleoh during Phase 2. While they might be beneficial in progressing the storyline immediately, in the long run they would just become headaches to deal with.The main focus was during Phase 3, at the secret laboratory. All the replica high-end magic books and the various production formulas were located in the Soul Library. I would also have to collect as many magically engineered items as I could while I was there.Taylee\u2019s Swordmaster's Skill seemed to have already improved up to its fifth skill, and I\u2019d heard that he was considered at least within Class B in order to be at the top in terms of swordsmanship. Since Taylee\u2019s specs didn\u2019t seem to be lacking, I could rest easy for a bit.In the first place, the final chapter of Act 2 was a bit complicated and had some unnecessary instances where you would end up with a bad ending. Though, if your specs kept up the fights were pretty simple. Most of the conditions that led to a bad ending were extremely unique, so there weren\u2019t any major issues with that. Though, naturally I shouldn\u2019t let my guard down. I would need to make sure to check on that, as well.Since I decided to follow him, I also might end up facing a situation that puts me in a crisis\u2026 That was why it would be perfect if I was accompanied by a colleague who could lend me their fighting power.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - HarleyJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *As for a person who was both kind towards me and willing to lend me their fighting power to support me\u2026 In my small group of acquaintances, that person was obvious.\u201cWhile I was walking around over there, I ended up dropping one of my belongings into the underground waterways. That\u2019s why I need to go down there and find it.\u201d\u201cThat sounds like it might be a bit difficult, but I\u2019ll help you, Ed!\u201d\u201cThanks, Yennekar. The underground waterways are very dark and damp. Plus, there are a few spaces that are quite narrow\u2026 It\u2019ll be better if you wear clothes that can get dirty. Thanks. I\u2019ll make sure to make it up to you.\u201d\u201cYeah, of course, Ed! But\u2026 You said it\u2019s dark and narrow\u2026?\u201dThe hand that was holding Yennekar\u2019s mug began to shake as she cleared her throat. The mid-ranking spirits that I couldn\u2019t see must have been whispering something in her ear, as she was waving her arms in the air like she was trying to get rid of them.\u201cW-Well, there\u2019s nothing we can do about that! Yeah! I\u2019ll just have to stick right next to you to make sure I don\u2019t get lost!\u201d\u201cAlright, thanks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly, after saying that, Yennekar began to clear her throat again as she gripped her hair.It seemed like she was organizing her thoughts.\u201cAs expected, I\u2019m too easy\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I-Is that so?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 If I don\u2019t come along, you\u2019re going to go by yourself, right? You would just run around in that dark place, trying to find it all by yourself, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t deny that.\u201d\u201cThen, that\u2019s not right\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t figure out why she was worrying about such useless thoughts, but either way, Yennekar seemed to be contemplating something.She was a girl who lived her entire life like a princess from a fairy tale. Her entire life had always revolved around accepting large amounts of kindness from others and repaying it back with her own love.You couldn\u2019t really call that a bad thing or blame her for being a person without a sense of reality.Yennekar\u2019s nature wasn\u2019t inherently a terrible thing, and it also wasn\u2019t like she was a person that lived while disconnected from reality. Rather, Lucy seemed to stand out more in that regard.All she was doing was happily living her life in a flower garden filled with goodwill. There was no one who could blame her for that.However, if Yennekar was the one who said that she wants to escape that fairytale life and enter reality, she would have a lot of responsibilities to take on.Sometimes, there would be moments where she would have to turn down someone\u2019s favor, or the inevitable moments where she would have to shake her head and decline someone\u2019s sincere request.If someone who was as good natured as Yennekar wanted to achieve that inner growth, a reasonable opportunity needed to present itself.No matter how nice a person might be, if their life became too difficult, there would come many instances where they would accept others\u2019 honest goodwill with suspicion and an ill heart.For an innocent girl, who had come straight out of a fairy tale, to become a full-grown adult\u2026 She would need to go through a difficult and desperate moment.But it didn\u2019t seem like that moment was going to happen\u2026 All I can tell her was to cheer up.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go together when the school\u2019s schedule is a little more relaxed\u2026 Maybe we will get some free time while the school is busy with something else\u2026 Maybe it would be perfect if we went during the Seal\u2019s Resonance Transferal.\u201dThe news about the Sage\u2019s Seal was being publicized to some extent. Of course, it wasn\u2019t something that the school was proud of, so the rumor only circulated lightly inside the school.Although it was rumored to be more of a mortgage-type transaction than a full-on sale, there was actually no doubt that it was the sale of the school\u2019s heart for money.Either way, Yennekar knew enough about the general situation for me to say that.\u201cSure, Ed. I\u2019ll be at the entrance of the underground waterways then. Oh wow, it\u2019s already gotten this late.\u201dAfter school ended for the day and we returned to the camp together, I finished making some bricks down by the stream and prepared some firewood while Yennekar was cleaning the inside of the cabin and preparing dinner.Before we knew it, the sky had turned dark, and one or two stars began to appear.\u201cToday is the student meeting back at Dex Hall, so I should hurry and head out. I hope you have a good night, Ed!\u201d\u201cAlright, Yennekar. Take care of yourself and watch your step as it gets darker.\u201dAnyway, Yennekar had a knack for making the people around her have a gentler and calmer attitude. In a way, it\u2019s rather ironic that she wasn\u2019t proud of it, despite being blessed with that nature.She laughed as she waved her hand at me, slowly walking away. I sat down alone by the fire, carving my arrows.* * *\u201cNext semester, the number of students in Class A will increase. Two other students will be promoted. In just one year, two more students have gone up. This year\u2019s class definitely has a lot of talented individuals.\u201dGathering students from the magic department, Professor Glast was in charge of the Class A that he had put together.There was no specific course name. though Professor Glast\u2019s special class\u2014which taught all aspects of magic\u2014was only available to a few select students.Currently, only three first-year students were allowed to attend the class. Ziggs, Lortel, and Lucy.\u201cClass B\u2019s Adele and Class C\u2019s Ayla are the most likely. Even joining the class halfway through, it won\u2019t affect the class\u2019s lessons, so there is no reason to worry.\u201dThe special classrooms located in the teacher district for Class A were spacious. However, there were only three students that were seated in that large lecture hall.There was one honest and hardworking boy sitting down and listening to Glast, while another girl was trying to read through Glast\u2019s inventions with an underlying smile. The last girl was in a deep sleep.There was no need to say who was who.\u201cOh my, it\u2019s Adele and Ayla. I guess those two didn\u2019t actually have poor and uncertain talent when it comes to magic or their combat abilities.\u201dAlthough Lortel dared to try and provoke the senior professor, Professor Glast showed no particular sign of displeasure.He would always treat those with talent with a larger amount of generosity and tolerance. You could say that, in that sense, his attitude was rather consistent.\u201cThey were not simply selected because of their amount of magic power or their level of magic power resonance. As long as they are individuals with some type of talent in magic, they will be admitted to Class A.\u201dThe school had complete trust in Professor\u2019s Glast\u2019s screening process. That meant that he had some level of freedom guaranteed to him when it came to picking students for his class.In return for that trust, Professor Glast\u2019s eyes were always able to accurately distinguish those with talent.Always playing musical instruments or singing, Adele always had a relaxed smile, making her famous amongst the students as a wandering minstrel or romanticist. Her strange talent, which let her use magic to play an instrument, was quite interesting even to Lortel.Ayla was less impressive when it came to her amount of magic power and her weak sense of resonance. However, her knowledge and academic ability were comparable to even the professors. In addition, Lortel had overheard before that she seemed to show an abnormal resonance to a unique magic power, instead of just regular magic power. Though, since it was outside of Lortel\u2019s interest, she didn\u2019t know many details.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t there be complaints brought up amongst the other students who want to join Class A?\u201d\u201cThat is something that I will need to take care of.\u201dThere were lots of students that were full of complaints against Professor Glast\u2019s class.\u201cHm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to say this, but\u2026 There were also a few other students whose magic power and resonance level didn\u2019t seem all that bad\u2026 So, if those students end up complaining\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste any of my time on those with uncertain talents.\u201dProfessor Glast responded sharply to Ziggs\u2019 comment. However, Ziggs continued to speak with a displeased expression on his face.\u201cI\u2019m saying this as carefully as possible to avoid being rude, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be careful with your words. Tell me exactly what you are feeling as it is. It won\u2019t hurt me in the slightest.\u201dEven though Ziggs\u2019 stuttered over his words a bit, he got his message across clearly.\u201cYou mentioned those with uncertain talents, but there are also people who are trying their hardest in a desire to be recognized. You don\u2019t know what ways they may or may not be able to improve, but I\u2019m sure their skills won\u2019t be low. That\u2019s why, when it seems like you are ignoring them because of their lackluster skills, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. It seems like you are unfairly demeaning their efforts.\u201dAs Ziggs continued to speak, he briefly looked up at Professor Glast\u2019s expression.Sitting down a few seats next to him, Lortel let out a sigh. Staring at Ziggs, she looked like she really couldn\u2019t understand him at all.Ziggs seemed to think the act of directly questioning Professor Glass' policy was disrespectful. He still really hadn\u2019t figured out just what type of person Professor Glast was.Even though it was a situation where it wouldn\u2019t be all that strange to get mad, Professor Glast continued to calmly respond in a rather subdued tone.\u201cDid you think that by demeaning and despising their efforts, I was looking down and ruining those kids lives, Ziggs Eiffelstein?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSilence suggested that it was true.\u201cI apologize for that. I don\u2019t particularly think that way. Rather, the surest way to ruin their life would be to hastily instill a sense of confidence in their uncertain talent by pushing them forward.\u201dLortel stopped listening to what he was saying.To someone like Lortel, who had gathered information regarding the personal histories of the academic staff, Professor Glast\u2019s remarks held a different meaning.Professor Glast\u2019s only daughter Myuri was a former student of the magic department at Silvenia and died after hastily participating in a monster subjugation.Just like a beetle is a beauty in the eyes of its mother, Professor Glast had expectations of Myuri as she seemed to have a talent for magic.And because of that sense of overconfidence in that uncertain talent of hers, there was no need to explain the details of what had happened when she jumped into participating in the monster subjugation.His excessive obsession with proven talents and respect towards the man that brought forth the age of progress.The reason that he was more passionate than anyone else for the birth of someone extraordinary, someone who could make the majority of those without talent follow behind them, was probably\u2026 To ultimately eliminate such unnecessary sacrifice.To some it might seem like a noble action, while to others it might be seen as extremely pitiful. Lortel didn\u2019t want to give any sympathy to him because, in this sense, it was purely self-righteousness.\u201cI understand.\u201dZiggs quietly lowered his eyes as he nodded. Digging any deeper than that would just be considered nosy.\u201cAnd Lortel Kehelland\u2026 Hmm\u2026 There\u2019s something I need to discuss with you that isn\u2019t related to this class. I will call on you later.\u201dIt must be because there was something he needed to discuss regarding the Sage\u2019s Seal Resonance Transferal.Lortel was the person who had bought the Sage\u2019s Seal, and Professor Glast was the one who was left responsible for the Seal\u2019s Resonance Transferal by the school.It was a matter that took place aside from their relationship as a teacher and student, so it wasn\u2019t something he could currently discuss at the podium.* * *[ Magic Skills Details ]Grade: Proficient MagicianSpecialized Field: ElementsCommon Magic:\u0700\u00a0Fast Casting Lvl 8\u0700\u00a0Mana Sense Lvl 8Fire Element Magic:\u0700\u00a0Ignite Lvl 14Wind Element Magic:\u0700\u00a0Wind Blade Lvl 13<Intermediate Magic can now be learned!>Spirit-type Magic:Spirit Resonance Lvl 12Spirit Understanding Lvl 12Spirit Manifestation Lvl 1Sense Sharing Lvl 1< Spirit Slot: Low-Ranking Fire Spirit Mugg>Resonance Level: 2Spiritual Efficiency: GoodUnique Skills:\u0700\u00a0Blessing of Fire Fortune (Temporary Immunity to Fire)\u0700\u00a0Explosion (Low-level Explosion)\u0700\u00a0Increased Ability of Fire-Type Magic< New Spirit Slot: Empty>It was about time to start learning Intermediate Magic.For students in the magic department, whether or not you could acquire mid-level magic was extremely important.The level of mid-level magic, also known as intermediate magic, was the boundary between an expert magician and a rudimentary one.Unless you were originally born with a talent for magic, you would usually start dealing with intermediate magic during the second year\u2019s curriculum or at the start of your third year. Even if you were only able to use two or three mid-level spells, it would be enough for you to be treated as a professional magician.In other words, a magician\u2019s ability was judged by how diverse and powerful their mid-level magic was. Only about 10% of Silvenia graduates were able to reach that level or beyond.Even with the same mid-level magic, the power it had was certainly different depending on the individual level or proficiency. For example, even though Lortel\u2019s Ice Spear was mid-level magic, it certainly exceeded the power of the other mid-level magic used by the second years.As for high-level magic, unless you were at a level higher than the faculty, you would only be able to use it partially. Even among the graduating fourth years, only students that were considered elite held a command over it.And if you were looking at the highest level of magic\u2026 In the first place, within Silvenia\u2014even counting the professors\u2014there were only one or two people who would be able to command it\u2026 Except for unusual cases, like Lucy.Anyway, my specs had risen to the extent that there shouldn\u2019t have been any problems with using mid-level magic. Considering where I started, I\u2019d grown so much that I had forgotten how weak I used to be.By the next elemental studies class, I would be able to partially fulfill my role as a real magician.Feeling satisfied by my progress, I closed my book where I was sitting in the corner of the classroom. Today\u2019s elemental studies class went rather deep, and there were many things for me to learn.\u201cEd, you have been called upon. After your next lecture ends, please go down to Professor Glast\u2019s laboratory, which is underneath the school\u2019s conference rooms in the teacher district.\u201dIt was when I was gathering my books about to leave the classroom that I heard the voice.It was the elemental studies teaching assistant, who I was already quite familiar with.\u201cHm? Are you saying I\u2019ve been summoned?\u201dCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t respond to Professor Glast\u2019s summons last time. It was because I ended up collapsing after overworking myself.I had forgotten about it, but because he called on me again, it seemed like it was important business.As far as I knew, Professor Glast shouldn\u2019t have been able to meet with anyone at the moment. The Seal\u2019s Resonance Transferal was in a few days, so he should be neck-deep in work. Of course, I was also busy.I still had to finish the work back at camp, prepare for final exams, and there were a few things I needed to check on regarding the storyline, so I didn\u2019t have much time to spare.I wanted to take care of my business slowly, as I didn\u2019t want to end up pushing my body too far. Though, I wondered if I was going to start getting busy again soon.\u201cHm\u2026. Alright. Tell him I got his message.\u201dThat was what I told the teaching assistant as I finished gathering my books.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Glast Subjugation (2)This concludes my magic notes, regarding my experiences while visiting the southern continent.After looking around the world, there were many truths about magic that I had yet to realize. My title of \u2018archmage\u2019 is nothing but an embarrassment.As expected, the study of magic is as wide and deep as the ocean. It\u2019s also become difficult for me to draw an outline of it all with these blurry old eyes of mine.I\u2019m reminded of Silvenia\u2019s belief, to not hastily infer the depths of learning.It seems that this book will most likely be the last one that I write. It\u2019s a shame that time keeps passing by.Back in the day, my hands were strong enough to break even steel, but now there are wrinkles between each of these fingers of mine.I\u2019m sure that if the Great Sage Silvenia, who was the greatest teacher and an idol to all scholars, saw me now\u2026 She would burst out laughing.Silvenia, who died at a young age, is still a beautiful woman in my memory.Because of her death, I decided to dedicate my life towards academics. Looking back on my life, it seemed to pass by in an instant.It did not seem all that great at the time, but now that I am in my final years, I see that my life was actually quite eventful.The sadness that ate at my heart the day my teacher died has now become nothing more than an old memory.Still, when living a long life, it\u2019s inevitable that you must occasionally face a sense of longing.As I watch over the starlight at dawn, or the slowly setting sun on the horizon, such emotions suddenly fill me without any warning.Longing is ultimately accompanied by a bitter loneliness.Sadness that comes from losing someone will sometimes even hinder your reason.There are certainly times when suddenly I am faced with the desire to break the providence and twist the truth of this world just to see Silvenia\u2019s face once more.However, those who are lost are lost.And those who have lost must become stronger. Sadly, that is the case in life.And that is why you must be strong.I dedicate the last sentence of this book to you, who has been the period to the end of my life.Lucy.-\u00a0\u300eClosing Text\u300f, Magic notes about his experiences when visiting the southern continent (Written by Glockt) Excerpt.* * *\u2026 There are times when a bad hunch occurs to you for no reason at all. When that happens, you need to organize your thoughts carefully.When your gut feeling starts to cry out, there is always a good reason for it.And my present situation was a perfect example of it.\u201cW-Why are you here\u2026?\u201dThe girl who entered the empty laboratory, with its door open, was someone I was very familiar with.Her short, wavy brown hair that fell into that innocent face of hers was one that I was extremely familiar with. In the first place, if you played Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster she was someone that you could never forget.The girl who always remained by the protagonist Taylee\u2019s side, supporting him as they grew together. One of the most important main characters in the storyline. No matter what you did or what route you took, she was a character whose presence could never be lost. The main heroine.The moment I ended up confronting Ayla Triss in the teacher district\u2019s conference room, all sorts of thoughts flooded my mind.\u201cWhy were you waiting here for me\u2026? D-Don\u2019t come any closer to me\u2026! Heeek\u2026!\u201dAs for me, since I had been called upon by Professor Glast, I went to his personal research lab. However, since there wasn\u2019t a single seat, I decided to sit on the sofa in the waiting room instead. Ayla thinking that I was waiting for her was just a misunderstanding.I just sat completely still on the sofa as I turned my eyes towards Ayla, who shuddered and ran away towards a wall in a corner of the laboratory by herself.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe reacted like she had come across a suspicious person. I wasn\u2019t really doing anything, so wasn\u2019t the way she was treating me a bit much?Well\u2026 Even though I felt that my reputation amongst the students had gotten better recently, there was no way Ayla was ever going to show a favorable attitude towards me.The most fundamental reason that she despised me so much was because of the incident at the entrance examination. As it happened over ten months ago, she might have lessened her anger to some extent, but\u2026 Well, it wasn\u2019t like I hadn\u2019t run into her in the meantime.Above all else, I was the one who kept persistently attacking Ayla, who was weak in terms of practical fighting power, back during the occupation of Ophelis Hall. Even though it was terrible of me, I had used her as their weakness, shooting her with my arrow.I couldn\u2019t really tell her that I had made it weaker by wrapping the arrow beforehand\u2026 Either way, from Ayla\u2019s point of view, there was no way she would ever look at me favorably.Well, her attitude wasn\u2019t the reason that my mind filled with such thoughts.It was because of the timing.The Resonance Transferal of the seal was just around the corner. It was likely an event to signal the start of Act 2\u2019s final chapter.By the time the resonance transfer took place, Ayla would already be subdued by Glast.I searched through my memories. Before and after the event, just what was Ayla up to?Of course, it was extremely difficult to try and search back for such a specific moment\u2026 But I was able to clearly recall a scene of her, right around the resonance transfer.In the main lobby of Trix Hall, the center of the school's administration, the Resonance Transferal of the Sage\u2019s Seal was taking place.While representatives of both the school and the company sat down together, the seal was to be removed by Professor Glast.The current resonance owner, Headmaster Obel, would release his authority over it, then leave the stage to allow Lortel to take ownership.Shortly after, an explosion would go off. All of the pre-engraved Magic Circles around Trix Hall and the Seal\u2019s display shelf would activate after being triggered by magic power, throwing the lobby into chaos.In the meantime, Glast would steal the seal that no one currently had authority over as he ran to Ayla, who he had subdued with his \u2018Time Prison\u2019 magic, back in his Trix Hall personal laboratory. He would then escape into the underground waterways.\u201cHey.\u201dAfter thinking back on it, I had a minor question regarding Ayla and her actions.By the time the Seal\u2019s resonance transferal took place, Ayla was already supposed to be subdued by Professor Glast and trapped in his personal laboratory back at Trix Hall.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Just\u2026 Professor Glast called on me\u2026 Never mind, it\u2019s none of your business.\u201dI started to think that my ominous gut feeling was starting to become a reality, little by little.My brain started spiraling.It was almost time for the meeting. That means that Professor Glast would soon return to his personal laboratory.As I strained on my ears, I could hear weak footsteps coming from the end of the hallway. It was highly likely that they were coming from Professor Glast, who had completed his work at school. It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to run down that hallway, as there was a high chance I would run into him one-on-one. Down the hallway of the secluded laboratory, there wouldn\u2019t be any witnesses, either.I quickly stood up from my seat as I strode up to Ayla, who was by the entrance. I pulled out the dagger wrapped around my thigh as Ayla flinched in surprise.\u201cKyaaaaaghk! Wh-What are you doing?!\u201dI didn\u2019t care about her reaction. I stuck the knife into the edge of the entrance\u2019s wall and turned around, looking at the empty laboratory.Professor Glast\u2019s private laboratory, which was more than 142 square feet, was full of piles of books and documents.All sorts of school administrative documents, academic books, personal research journals, entry-level magic books, and more were piled up, filling the entirety of the spacious lab.I quickly glanced over each cabinet, one by one, as well as the documents that piled up on his desk.I quickly flipped through the pages of the personal journal that I found in one of the drawers, quickly reading the notes and memos he\u2019d written down.Most of the content was things I had already known about, so I could read through it quickly. I had already figured out about 90% of the situation already. It was no more than a habit of mine to check if there was even a\u00a0chance\u00a0that the future I knew of could have possibly changed.Nevertheless, there seemed to be no significant variables that would have changed anything.Just why in the world did Professor Glast call me personally to his personal laboratory?\u00a0 I decided that figuring out the reason was urgent, but no matter how much I looked, it seemed as if the storyline was still following the original timeline properly.At that rate of progression, without any changes, it wasn\u2019t hard to picture the final scene, where Glast was defeated by Taylee.However, if there was a small mix-up in the timeline, I would definitely need to check and fix it.Considering the circumstances, after quickly spinning the gears in my head to figure out what was going on, it seemed that Professor Glast had called Ayla to his personal laboratory to kidnap her.That wasn\u2019t all that difficult to predict. Because there wasn\u2019t much time left before the Seal\u2019s Resonance Transferal, he would need to start taking action soon.The question was, why did he also call me there?Very dimly, my gut feeling started speaking to me. I wasn\u2019t particularly safe, either.Thump, Thump, ThumpThe sound of Professor Glast\u2019s footsteps started to creep closer as he approached the laboratory across the hallway.\u201cHeeeeeghk\u2026! Heeeeghk\u2026 Help me\u2026\u201d\u2018All I did was pull out a dagger and approach her. Was it really all that scary\u2026?\u2019But as I thought about it, I had to change my mind as I realized that it must have been plenty scary for her.I was sorry for that, but I was in quite a hurry, too.I poked around Professor Glast\u2019s desk quickly, opening all the drawers. I unfolded all the documents that I could find, reading through them quickly before throwing them down. Then I opened all the magic books, trying to determine what each of them was about.Opening the cabinets as the contents fell out, I went through all the folders that were finished being handled, all while quickly going through all the official documents he had stored.Most of the information I found were things I already knew, unimportant, or not related to the incident at all. As I searched through the papers like a thief looking for valuables, I found a file in the corner of a filing cabinet.\u2018Record of investigation into the Occupation of Ophelis Hall and the current status of investigation.\u2019Unfolding the documents, underneath there was a large crystal ball. Among them, there were traces of their investigation into what I had done at Ophelis Hall.None of this was Professor Glast\u2019s work. Looking at who from the school was in charge of handling this document, there was a name that I recognized.\u201cI heard that the assistant professor Cleoh entered the northern forest yesterday. Did you see her, Ed?\u201dSuddenly, the piece of information that Yennekar had given me popped into my memory, its importance suddenly clear.Looking at the crystal ball laying among the documents, it was definitely the thoughtography crystal ball that the school used. Even though the magic power that was infused into it didn\u2019t reveal anything, it wasn\u2019t difficult for me to infer just what scene the crystal ball had captured.At that moment, I realized I had to figure out just how things were turning out quickly.Thud!Professor Glast opened the door, entering the room.He was dressed in a neat faculty uniform, wearing a white magician's robe. His skinny body and hair, which stuck out and looked rather fussy, were the same as usual.\u201cP-Professor Glast!\u201dAyla, who was startled, quickly got up.She quickly hid behind Professor Glast as her body trembled in fear.\u201cH-Help me, please! That guy is holding a dagger\u2026!\u201dHeeeeeeeeeeghk!Hwaaaghk!Magic power began to fill the entire laboratory. Professor Glast\u2019s collar began to float as if he were in outer space, and for a brief instant my body was hit with an immense pressure.\u201cKyaaaghk!\u201dProfessor Glast had reached his hand out to Ayla, who had fallen.Unlike ordinary mana, which was a clear color by nature, the magic power that Celestial Magic used had more of a reddish color to it.A sense of magic power, as thick as mud, began to envelop Ayla. Shortly after, the Celestial magic power began to restrain the unconscious girl.The Celestial Magic \u2018Time Prison\u2019.Once she was subdued by \u2018Time Prison\u2019, she hardened like stone\u2014completely stuck in place.Interestingly, until the magic ended, she would not be able to be affected from the outside in any way.Pushing, scratching, hitting her with a stone, or cutting her with a knife. It wouldn\u2019t have any effect on Ayla.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dProfessor Glast\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest.As if he was just taking care of his business as usual, he reached out towards me without even declaring that I was next. Dark red magic power began to rise from Professor Glast\u2019s body, heading in my direction immediately.\u201cMugg!\u201dIt took less than a second to make a decision.The elemental magic \u2018Explosion\u2019 that was imprinted in the dagger that I had stuck into the wall by the entrance activated itself.By nature, Explosion was also accompanied by quite a long casting time. By imbuing it with the elemental spell beforehand, I was able to omit the entire process producing only the result.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *Boom!\u201cKeughh!\u201dCaught up in the unexpected explosion, Professor Glast disappeared into the smoke.I confirmed that he was taking a defensive stance just before he disappeared. He wouldn\u2019t have been defeated just by that one attack.In the first place, right at the start of the explosion he had instantly cast noise suppression magic to keep the disruption from getting any bigger. It was an incredible show of reflexes and agility, to the point it gave me goosebumps.Either way, the entrance near that side was blocked, so I couldn\u2019t move hastily. I quickly jumped over to the side, pushing myself underneath Professor Glast\u2019s desk.\u2018Time Prison\u2019 didn\u2019t work unless you directly touched the Celestial magic power.Basically, that dark red mana was really difficult to handle, so if you lost focus even a little it would fade away. As long as I was able to avoid it, I shouldn\u2019t get hurt by it.\u201cYou\u2019re rather quick at figuring out the situation, Ed Rothstaylor. Your actions are extremely smooth.\u201dIn the rising smoke, the light in his eyes started to shine.\u201cIn that short period of time\u2026 Did you really manage to go through all my research papers and academic paperwork?\u201dHe seemed to think that I had found out about his true intentions after reading through all of his documents.There wasn\u2019t any reason for me to do that in the first place. I already knew from the very beginning just what course of action Professor Glast was planning to take.However, I didn\u2019t expect to get caught up in it.\u201cI can tell that you were anticipating and preparing for my attack just from your movements and the way you are currently handling the situation. But it\u2019s strange. There\u2019s no way you should have been able to figure out my true intentions just by going through all these documents.\u201d\u201cProfessor Glast, is there really a need for you to subdue me?\u201dWith the desk between us, I started to cast \u2018Ignite\u2019 on the tip of my finger.Before Professor Glast arrived in the laboratory, I gathered all the papers together and piled them up near his desk.At that point, there was no way to determine what was important and what was not.But if I were to burn the entire stack of papers, it would certainly cause a problem.Actually, losing just a few of those papers wasn\u2019t that big a deal.If I burned a few of his papers, it wasn\u2019t like the entire plan would fall apart immediately. However, I was almost certain that it would set things back.The Resonance Transferal was that day and the next, so it would be a disaster if things were to go wrong.Because of that, I could use those documents as a hostage\u2014to some extent, anyway.Of course, it was a very weak attempt.If I were to make a mistake, I would just end up sacrificing all of those documents and he would subdue me. However, Professor Glast would want to subdue me quietly using Celestial Magic, trying to avoid as much damage to the documents as possible.Taking advantage of any cracks in his thought process, if there was even the slightest bit of hesitation an opportunity for negotiations would present itself.\u201cProfessor Glast. This is just a groundless guess, but the reason you need Ayla\u2026 Is it because she has an unusual resonance with Celestial Magic? If that\u2019s the case, you have already subdued her, so you\u2019ve achieved your goal. There should be no reason for you to subdue me as well. My lips are sealed, so you won\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\u201cIf that were the case, I wouldn\u2019t have called you to my laboratory, would I?\u201dAs long as he had Ayla, wouldn\u2019t everything go according to plan?I couldn\u2019t understand why he would want to go as far as to call me out and subdue me.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason to have you here. Because of that reason, I hope you don\u2019t think too badly of me.\u201dMaking such vague statements\u2026 Wasn\u2019t that too much? Couldn\u2019t he just explain?Well, to be fair, he didn\u2019t even say a single word when he had subdued Ayla. Maybe it was obvious that he would treat me the same way.At the rate things were going, if I were subdued, I\u2019d be dragged to Professor Glast\u2019s secret laboratory with Ayla.A laboratory that was located in the middle of Trix Hall. It wouldn\u2019t be good if things got any bigger, so he was going to try and subdue me with as little magic as possible to avoid attention.With that being the case, I tried to think of a way to beat Professor Glast and escape from Trix Hall. Though, while thinking of just breaking through the wall altogether, a new possibility suddenly came to my mind.\u2018\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it just be okay to get kidnapped?\u2019That was the sort of reverse-thinking I came up with.Because \u2018Time Prison\u2019 ate up a lot of magic power, there was clearly a time limit. If he were to subdue the two of us, then he would run out of magic power within just a few days.Just like the original timeline, he\u2019d steal the Sage\u2019s Seal and lock me and Ayla down in his secret laboratory. Then, he would eventually release us from the Time Prison.Even if things didn\u2019t work out, Taylee\u2019s party would eventually storm down into his secret laboratory and make a scene. At that time, wouldn\u2019t it be best to just grab the things I needed and run away?The secret laboratory\u2019s layout was something I knew so well, I was completely sick of it. I didn\u2019t have to get a headache dealing with the waterways and secretly following the subjugation team or making Yennekar go through a hard time unnecessarily.Taylee\u2019s specs were also more than high enough. Plus, the other members of the subjugation team were not weak by any means.Then\u2026 Should I just get kidnapped?\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dMy mind started to spin again.Even if I succeeded in escaping, Professor Glast wouldn\u2019t just stand still and do nothing about it. Rather, it was more likely that the schedule for the Resonance Transferal would be disrupted because Professor Glast would be trying to subdue me after I saw his true colors.On the other hand, deliberately getting kidnapped was also risky. If things started to go wrong and the storyline went awry during my absence, there would be no one who could take measures against it.I\u2019d been thoroughly checking the flow of the story, to the point that I wondered if I really needed to go that far, but it was impossible to really know when or how something else would get tangled up.I had no choice but to weigh each option, determining which one has the bigger risk, eventually choosing what I will do.\u201cIt would be great if you didn\u2019t resist futilely. Since I don\u2019t have time to give a long explanation, I'll have to skip over it. Trust me, it won\u2019t be all that bad a story for you either, Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dI carefully came out of hiding, stepping away from the desk and looking directly at Professor Glast.\u201cOh, did you want to stand against me? Or did you come up with some sort of plan?\u201dFacing Professor Glast, I stood still with my eyes wide.The magic power began to rise as he fired it towards me.* * *Whoooooooooosh!With Professor Glast\u2019s Telekinesis Magic, he returned all sorts of documents and magic books back to their original spots.In his personal laboratory, which had been cleaned up to some extent, there were two people who had been completely hardened.One was the form of Ayla, who was rolling on the floor with a face of terror.The other was the form of Ed, who was standing up straight and taking Professor Glast\u2019s magic head-on, not avoiding it.Professor Glast sat down at his work desk, opening Ed\u2019s investigation report once again.Bit by bit, he started to remember the conversation he had with Assistant Professor Cleoh, who was in charge of making the report.\u201cMagic history, Introduction to Spiritual Studies, Elemental Studies Writing, Monster Ecology, Common Magic Power Studies, Principles of Resonance Analysis, Magic Studies, Introduction to Magic Engineering, Herbology, Introduction to Magic Circles, Separate Elemental Studies\u2026 He got nearly perfect scores in all of his writing subjects.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! As soon as he entered his second year, his grades all jumped up! His practical classes are still a bit uncertain, but they are still slowly on the rise. His overall magic power is still a bit below average compared to the other second years, but his pace of growth is just ridiculous. Apparently, he even made a contract with a spirit, so it makes sense that he collapsed from overworking.\u201dAssistant Professor Cleoh spoke excitedly as she tapped the papers.\u201cWhen I first saw the change in his grades, I was quite suspicious. I couldn\u2019t believe that he achieved so much in his studies, all while living in the wilds. It\u2019s like he\u2019s living every day by himself for forty-eight hours! Really!\u201dAssistant Professor Cleoh was looking over Ed\u2019s transcript, which she had received from the school\u2019s headquarters.In the first place, she wasn\u2019t in charge of his grades, and the number of students she dealt with daily wasn\u2019t small. Because of that, it wasn\u2019t possible for her to know of all the developments in his grades.However, after her attention started to focus on Ed, she checked over his personal information. Seeing it, she couldn\u2019t help but be completely dumbfounded.Assistant Professor Cleoh had a pretty good sense of self-management.She looked like someone with a screw loose, but there was a reason she was a professor even at her young age.Since she was like that, she could clearly see just how ridiculous the amount of effort Ed had been putting into his daily work and lifestyle was.\u201cThis is\u2026 This is the result of really putting in effort, with his life on the line. You should also know this Professor Glast, but Ed\u2019s talent isn\u2019t at a level that could be considered outstanding by any means.\u201dBefore she knew it, Cleoh\u2019s tone of voice was starting to quiet.\u201cJust how much effort did he put in? To the point he was coughing up blood\u2026 I can\u2019t even guess the amount.\u201d\u201cWhether or not he\u2019s the black curtain and the reason you\u2019re getting this excited over him are completely different matters, Assistant Professor Cleoh.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, that\u2019s true. But\u2026! I just didn\u2019t expect his record to be like this\u2026!\u201dProfessor Glast closed the folder and tossed it aside.Laying back in his chair, he quietly stared at Ed, who had been completely frozen by \u2018Time Prison\u2019.Even at the moment the ominous magic power hit him, he didn\u2019t blink once. His expression also showed no signs of anxiety. It was the moment that he had been hit by Glast\u2019s magic that Professor Glast felt a certain confidence instilled in him, rendering him speechless.Until he was excommunicated from the Rothstaylor Family, where he had been treated with all sorts of nobility, he lived a life that even a King would even be jealous of.But less than a year after that fact, his hands were now full of calluses and his body was covered in all sorts of scratches.His body, which used to look rather slender and weak, was now already full of fine muscles. Even from his collar, you could just start to see his muscles taking shape.Also, the sense for combat he had seen through the crystal ball was something that couldn\u2019t be easily overlooked.Controlling the battlefield, thoroughly analyzing his opponents, and taking advantage of all available means to win was an ability that one who was born with natural talent and could defeat everyone could never have.It was the way the weak fought.Even if one humbly admitted that they were weaker than their opponent, it was a peak that could only be reached if, and only if, they didn\u2019t give up on winning. The mind had to be stronger than the body.What came to mind was someone he had \u2018lost.\u2019It was a wound that he thought had healed.The memory of seeing his only daughter\u2019s back as she went out on her way to assist in the monster subjugation, all to improve her father\u2019s name.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlast, who was sitting completely still and organizing his thoughts, ultimately never noticed what was happening.A small figure, shaped like a bat, popped out from underneath Ed\u2019s collar and quickly flew out the door.For Professor Glast, who only had the fundamentals of spiritual resonance, didn\u2019t catch that brief moment. There was too much for him to think about.In the first place, the plan was to only kidnap Ayla. However, he ended up having to subdue Ed as well.Still, Ed\u2019s social circle wasn\u2019t very large, and he had a mixed reputation, so there wouldn't be a big fuss if he were to disappear. At least for a few days, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.It wasn\u2019t an issue to the point that it would cause a major setback in his plans.Thinking that, Professor Glast quietly started to relax, ridding himself of his nervousness.***Smoke rose from the campfire.The camp was in the northern forest. Over the campfire was a well-made chicken soup, boiling and waiting for someone to taste it.An elementalist girl continued to hum as she stirred the soup. Meanwhile, another magician with a small frame slept, snoring away on the roof of the cabin.The two of them looked natural, as if they were living their daily lives\u2026 Though the actual owner of the camp was nowhere to be seen.As the examination period approached, there were many things to take care of coming up to the end of the semester. It was only natural that his return home would be delayed.Since he was a person that was always busy, it couldn't be helped. With such thoughts in mind, the elementalist girl stared blankly up at the night sky.As she did so, a burning bat urgently flew through the grass, coming to sit on the girl's shoulder.As it whispered something into her ear in a desperate manner, little by little the girl stopped moving.The wind blew by as the trees in the forest began to shake.The autumn night kept on going on.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Glast Subjugation (3)Ayla, who had gone to meet with Professor Glast, has not returned.Sitting in a corner on the campus grounds, Taylee\u2014who had stuffed a sandwich in his mouth\u2014suddenly tilted his head.The Monster Ecology course\u2019s lessons were rather easy, similar to an elective course. Since it was Ayla, who was already well versed in such subjects, passing the test wouldn\u2019t be a problem even if she missed a few classes.However, it was strange that she hadn\u2019t been seen at all, given that she had both Elemental Studies and Combat Magic classes in the teacher\u2019s district.It was Ayla, who had extremely poor proficiency when it came to combat-type skills. There was no way that someone as hard-working as her would miss a class specializing in an area she was weak in.\u201c\u2026 Did she head back to the dorm?\u201dHis long, two-handed sword\u2014embedded with many jewels\u2014seemed to be perfect in length.The jewels were filled with magic power, which supported the various magics imbued in the sword.Not only that, all of the other accessories he was wearing were also imbued with various smaller effects. He had become rather proficient, even in other secondary support skills. No longer could he be called a failing student wherever he went.He still had a long way to go, but he had managed to complete a decent amount of meaningful training over the past year.Taylee picked up the sword he had put down nearby while eating his meal, turning his body to look around. As his Swordmaster\u2019s Skills increased, his vitality also increased. He wouldn\u2019t have a problem with his physical condition, even if he were to push himself a little more after classes.\u201cDid some type of important business come up?\u201dTaylee kept talking to himself as he started walking away.There were two days until the Sage\u2019s Seal Resonance Transferal.It was only a matter of time before Taylee would hear the rumors claiming that Professor Glast had kidnapped two students.* * *Without any notice, my eyes suddenly snapped open.I suddenly woke, no trace of the feeling I would normally get after a good night\u2019s sleep.In my slightly dazed state, I couldn\u2019t focus immediately. Soon after, I remembered the situation I had been in right before I lost consciousness. I held onto my sense of reason.\u201cEeeeeek!\u201dAfter quickly recovering my memories and promptly raising my upper body, I heard a strange noise.The first thing that I saw was a ceiling made of stone. Looking down a little lower, there was a smooth wall made of the same material.There was an iron bar set up on one side. Looking around, the immediate image that came to mind was a prison cell. Inside of it, a girl was trapped alongside me.\u201cD-Don\u2019t come any closer!\u201dThe girl crouching in a corner of the prison wall shouted at me with a shaky voice. On one hand, she was taking a defensive position and holding her body close. However, seeing her so full of fear only proved that she didn\u2019t have the power to resist.Really. If I were a black-hearted criminal she definitely would have been the perfect prey.Well, it wasn\u2019t a crime to be scared, but\u2026 It wasn\u2019t the smart thing to do.\u201cAyla Triss\u2026 Right\u2026?\u201dI tried to suppress my growing headache as I used my hands to wipe across my face. I stood up from my seat, taking in the scene once more and checking to see what was outside of the bars.I thought I knew the reason that Ayla was so terrified.Looking through the bars in the room across from ours\u2026 There was a monster being kept in the prison.Its lower body appeared to be that of a lion\u2019s or a tiger\u2019s, but its upper body was on the large side\u2014even compared to other monsters. Looking somewhat like a rugged Ogre, with feathers protruding from its forearms, half a demon\u2019s wing on one side of its back, and a bluish discharge trickling out of its severed ear\u2026 Not only did it have two arms, but there were all sorts of arms protruding from its waist and its back.Since it was asleep, it didn\u2019t appear hostile. However, its looks were enough to make your breath catch from nerves just by looking at it.It was Act 2, Chapter 7\u2019s \u2018Devil of the Underground Waterways\u2019. Professor Glast\u2019s research team was holding it to study it and further research on monsters.Ayla had been called to a professor\u2019s laboratory, only to be attacked suddenly and fall unconscious. Then, once she\u2019d woken up, she had come face to face with a sleeping monster.Not to mention, she was in the same room with the unconscious fallen aristocrat that was an enemy of hers\u2026 I could understand Ayla\u2019s dramatic reaction.\u201cI see you\u2019ve regained consciousness, Ed Rothstaylor.\u201dOn the other side of the bars, a man that appeared to be the caretaker came into view.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the poor treatment you\u2019re receiving despite being a precious student.\u201dHis face was full of wrinkles. He was wearing a mask to hide the burn scars that he had received while researching elemental studies. Right on the edge of the mask, I could see a bit of the scar that certainly caught my eye.His bent spine, small stature, patchy hair\u2026 It all showed the passage of time and stress, making him look like a scruffy old man\u2026 Either way, he was the most well-rounded of all Professor Glast\u2019s colleagues and followers.Koom, a researcher of Celestial Studies.In the final chapter of Act 2, Professor Glast\u2019s laboratory phase, he played the role of the final boss.He was an enemy with quite a tricky pattern, but if you avoided his attacks and bought time, the Celestial Magic Power would eventually eat away at him until he self-destructed. After that, the Devil of the Underground Waterways would escape from the laboratory once more, buying Professor Glast some time to escape.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what Professor Glast is thinking, but I have been instructed to take care of you thoroughly, as you are both necessary talents.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re calmer than I thought you would be.\u201d\u2018Opening my eyes to find myself in Professor Glast\u2019s secret laboratory\u2026\u2019\u00a0 That was something I had already predicted would unfold, even before I had fallen unconscious. It was something that was supposed to happen, so there wasn\u2019t a reason for me to be taken aback by it.\u201cI thought you would jump at me and cause a ruckus like Ayla. You\u2019re quick to understand what I say, more than I had expected.\u201dFrom what he was saying, it appeared that Ayla had started screaming to be let go as soon as she\u2019d come to her senses.As he turned his head and looked towards Ayla, she flinched and took on a rather pathetic defensive stance once more. As for me, I didn\u2019t have the slightest intention to do anything of the sort. My paranoia over getting seriously hurt was a disease.\u201cWell, Professor Glast must have a reason for all of this.\u201dWhen I responded with such a simple answer, both Ayla and Koom tilted their heads in confusion.No matter how much confidence I might have in Professor Glast\u2019s academic achievements and abilities, it wasn\u2019t normal for me to say such a thing after being subdued and kidnapped without a single explanation.I didn\u2019t particularly believe in Professor Glast as in the first place. Being a character that would meet his fall at the end of the storyline anyway, I really couldn\u2019t.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll be at the end of this corridor looking over some research data while I monitor everything, so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dAfter saying that, Koom walked towards the end of the hallway.Sticking my head out, I looked down the hallway and\u2014as expected\u2014it had the exact same layout as the game.If you went across the hallway, you would probably find the Monster Research room. It was pretty much the central location here in Professor Glast\u2019s secret laboratory.I still couldn\u2019t believe I was able to go deep into that place without any risks. The route I needed to take had been shortened quite a bit.There was nothing else I had to do. All I needed to do was sit around and wait. Everything would be fine.While I sat there and waited mindlessly, Taylee would eventually show up with his subjugation team to save the kidnapped Ayla. They would make a complete wreck of the laboratory. During that moment, I would take the opportunity to escape, and head straight to the Soul Library.To get all the way down to the monster research room, they would have to go through the Soul Library and defeat the librarian. Once Taylee arrived, the library would have already been fully cleared.No matter what I ended up doing, there wouldn\u2019t be any magic books or bookshelves with souls in them to interfere, as they would have already been subdued. Also, there wouldn\u2019t be any angry soul librarians as I wandered the library.With the area completely free of those that would get in my way, I could run around and finish my plans\u2014gathering all the various magic book replicas and magic engineering production formulas that I wanted.And what would I have to do during that time? What will I have to take care of?Absolutely nothing.\u2026 The idea of reaping so many benefits without putting in any of the work was starting to make my conscience hurt.\u201cHeeek\u2026 Eeek\u2026\u201dWell, it was a bit mentally exhausting being in the same space as Ayla while she trembled in fear.Professor Glast really made a poor choice. Why kidnap Ayla, of all people?That woman was just a ticking time bomb, one that was heavily favored by the main characters of the world. Since he picked the wrong person, he should at least be prepared to have his laboratory completely destroyed.Even as I said that, I do feel a little sorry for Professor Glast. He didn\u2019t have the luxury of knowing the full situation.\u201cIf you take even one step closer, I\u2019ll scream. I\u2019ll bite my tongue, so don\u2019t come any closer. I\u2026 I\u2019m serious! D-Do I look like I\u2019m lying? If I fight back with all my might, even you won't be able to walk away unscathed! So don\u2019t move an inch!\u201dI wasn\u2019t moving. I didn\u2019t say a word, and I really don\u2019t care whether she bit her tongue or not. I was just blankly staring into the air, trying to organize my thoughts as Ayla\u2019s legs suddenly fell asleep and she started spewing out sharp words at me.When I glared at her, she gathered some weak magic power and created a low-grade defense.Her beginner Elemental Magic proficiency had improved somewhat, but not enough to keep up with her grade. With a defense as weak as that, I would be able to shatter it even casting a quick and half-assed \u2018Wind Blade\u2019. Though, considering that her body was still trembling in fear, she did put up the best defense that she could.After everything that had happened, I didn\u2019t think it would be of use to tell her that I didn\u2019t have any hostility towards her.If I had to decide how I felt towards Ayla, it would have to be more friendly or kindly.I had already played Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster several times. Within every route, at any point in time or in any situation, I was able to witness her honesty and sincerity as she stood next to the protagonist time and time again.It was quite commendable, so I viewed her highly. Why would I ever think of her with hatred or hostility?Given the situation, and what Ayla thought of me, it couldn\u2019t be helped that she would stay away from me like that\u2026 But still, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to at least say everything that I have to say to her either way.\u201cI\u2019m not going to attack you, so you don\u2019t have to overreact.\u201dI decided to only speak facts.\u201cI don\u2019t have any ill feelings towards you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Did you say\u2026?\u201dSitting in a corner of the prison cell, I sighed deeply as I stared up at the ceiling.Ayla still hadn\u2019t relaxed at all, despite my totally disinterested behavior towards her. For a long time, she kept staring at me as she breathed heavily. Then she slowly lowered her arm, though she still had that anxious expression on her face.As the magic power flowing along her arms stopped, the defense she had been keeping up gradually faded. It didn\u2019t mean much in the first place since Ayla\u2019s level of magic power meant that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep that defense up for an extended period of time anyway.\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re lying.\u201d\u201cIf I did want to harass you for some reason, would it make any sense for me to waste this golden opportunity? Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dIn a place where no one could get away, where our vast difference in strength meant that Ayla couldn\u2019t fight back\u2026Ayla must have been completely horrified, trembling in fear because she recognized that fact.\u201cStop wasting your strength saying stupid things and just sit still, Ayla.\u201dI spoke to Ayla with a confident tone to my voice.\u201cAs long as you wait, Taylee will eventually come to save you.\u201d\u201cTaylee\u2026? You\u2026 Do you even have the right to say his name\u2026?\u201d\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t? Well, I am sorry about what happened at the entrance exam, but there was a reason I had to do that back then. There\u2019s also the fact that he helped tremendously during the Glasskan Incident.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sorry\u2026?\u201dAyla glanced down at me with her eyes full of confusion, staring at me again.\u201cSaying that you\u2019re sorry\u2026 Did you just apologize? Right now, you\u2026? Are you really Ed Rothstaylor?\u201d\u201cAre you suspicious of me just because I apologized? Seriously, why can\u2019t you just trust me?\u201dThat wouldn\u2019t have been a strange reaction if I were the same Ed from before I entered his body, but it had already been a year since then.At that point, she needed to calm down and accept it already. Whether the character Ed had changed, gone crazy after being excommunicated, or he was like that from the beginning\u2026 Just accept one of those reasons as fact and realize that I no longer had the desire to pick a fight with her like before.As long as the main storyline didn\u2019t get twisted, I didn\u2019t really care what she did. None of that was of interest to me.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t believe in me, you can believe in Taylee, right?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come and rescue you. He\u2019ll find out that you\u2019ve been kidnapped and he\u2019ll somehow figure out his way down to this secret laboratory, destroying everything in his path as he comes to get you out of here. So don't be scared for no reason at all. Just trust in him while you wait.\u201dChanging my strategy, I started mentioning Taylee\u2019s name a lot more as her expression relaxed a bit. Nevertheless, that defensive stance of hers didn\u2019t change one bit. Sitting in a corner and trembling like a little puppy in front of a wild beast\u2026 Seeing that, I felt sorry for her instead of angry.\u201cI believe in Taylee.\u201d\u201cAlright. That\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t want Taylee to come to my rescue.\u201dWhat nonsense was she talking about now?Ayla continued with her story with her face buried in her knees.\u201cI\u2019m nothing more than a useless lump of baggage for him. Taylee has gone through all sorts of hardships in his life. If he ends up risking his life breaking into this place, which is full of monsters, all because I was kidnapped\u2026 Then I\u2019d rather\u2026\u201d\u201cAyla Triss. You\u2019ve been watching over Taylee all this time, so you know perfectly well that he\u2019s the kind of guy that becomes stronger with each hardship in his way.\u201dThe protagonist of <Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster>, Taylee McLaure.A boy who had faced countless hardships in his life but grew stronger because of them.If I were in his place, I would never want to live a life like that. However\u2026 It wasn\u2019t about me. It was about him.\u201cJust think of it as another hardship that will make him stronger as he moves forward. All you have to do is leave it to him, alright?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s not something you can say when all you\u2019re doing is receiving his help.\u201d\u201cOf course. We should also thank him. Either way, the important thing is that you stop jumping to conclusions, quit making a fuss, and stop being so nervous. Honest to a fault, you just have to believe in him. He\u2019ll definitely come to your rescue. Got it?\u201dAfter saying all of that, Ayla\u2019s defensive stance seemed to be a little more relaxed than before. It would have been great if she stopped whining. I was sure that she was probably at least a little bit better.\u201cEd Rothstaylor, I had no idea you would say such a thing\u2026\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 I saw you insulting, looking down on Taylee.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Well, that is true\u2026\u201dAs far as I knew, Ed was definitely that type of person.\u201cWell, I had a reason for that. Don\u2019t try to figure everything out.\u201dIf explaining something became too annoying or was something you couldn\u2019t say, it would be best to just gloss over it quickly. I didn\u2019t want to tell her everything unnecessarily and I don\u2019t want to get involved with her any deeper than I had to.\u2018Please just stay quiet and patiently sit down as we wait for Taylee. Don\u2019t waste your energy for no reason.\u2019Since I didn\u2019t want to say anything unnecessary, I just sat there with my mouth tightly shut.I had checked as much as I could have before I had been kidnapped. So far, it seemed that there hadn\u2019t been any major cracks or twists. As long as I sat still like I was doing, it should have been enough.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - PlumperProofreader - Harley* * *After sitting in the prison cell like that for a while, I heard something.[Young master Ed! Are you okay?! Are you hurt anywhere?! Is that a major wound on your forearm? Do you feel exhausted at all because of your response to magic power?! Is your vision alright?! Are there any problems with your sense of smell or hearing?! Is the sensation at the tip of your fingers down to your toes all okay?! Do you feel tired or exhausted in any way?! Did your complexion worsen in any way, or did your heart rate accelerate too high? How about your pulse?!]Mugg suddenly appeared in between the bars, bombarding me with a strange number of detailed questions about my physical condition.[Since I was only following your reaction to magic power, I was a bit late! Young master Ed\u2019s spiritual resonance level was still at a normal level, so with some time, I was able to detect it! Even though I may be worthless, please accept my apologies! I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t see you for that short while!]I reached out my hand pleasantly towards Mugg, who was greeting me politely. Where had the little guy been all that time?It was tiring having to talk to Ayla, who kept defending herself with those sharp comments of hers. I was really glad that I would have someone else to talk to before the rescue team arrived.\u201cMugg, you were able to find where I was.\u201d[Yes, I was quite surprised as well! I had no idea that there was a laboratory this deep in the underground waterways! I had no idea the size would be this big, either! That professor. I was wondering where he was going to spend all of his money, but he ended up creating this!]Did he manage to sneak into the deepest part of the laboratory by flying around with that small body of his? I could say with certainty\u2026 Yennekar\u2019s assessment of him as a competent spirit wasn\u2019t a lie at all.[I was really surprised when you ended up being subdued back at Trix Hall! I\u2019m so relieved to see that you aren\u2019t hurt anywhere!]\u201cYeah. Thanks for worrying about me, Mugg.\u201d\u201cI-Is that\u2026 a spirit\u2026? Is that really one?\u201dAyla was also well-versed in Spiritual Studies. With some level of resonance, she seemed to be reacting to Mugg\u2019s appearance.Though, it seemed that she didn\u2019t have a high enough resonance level to be able to communicate with Mugg. It also seemed like she couldn't hear him.\u201cEd Rothstaylor, you can deal with spirits? But last semester, couldn\u2019t you just barely manage beginner elemental magic?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Well, it\u2019s none of your business, right?\u201d\u201cUhm, well\u2026\u201dThis time I responded with something that would blindside her. She started to get a bit timid, knowing that what I said was true.However, when she started to act shy, she really acted shy. That made it impossible to figure out the rhythm I needed to match to her.\u201cW-Well\u2026 If there\u2019s a spirit\u2026 And you can handle it, then that means you can send a request for help\u2026! You can notify the school faculty members and other professors that are able to deal with spirits about the situation!\u201dThere was no need for me to reiterate that there was no way that I was going to do something that would increase the chances of creating variables.As I considered how to respond, Mugg suddenly spoke up.[There\u2019s no need to worry, young master Ed! I have already informed the most reliable person, Lady Yennekar, of the entire situation! I\u2019m too useless and undeserving, so I couldn't keep young master Ed safe by myself. However\u2026 I\u2019ve been trained more than anyone else on the emergency reporting system!]\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201d[Haha! It\u2019s a bit embarrassing to say this myself, but I'm very calm when it comes to situations like this. Knowing what to do or how to act, I\u2019ve memorized the rules when it comes to something like this, to the point that it\u2019s second nature! Soon, Lady Yennekar will come to rescue you! Either she will come by herself, or she will come leading a party. Either way, she will come down here and save you somehow\u2026 So don\u2019t be too worried! Let's stay calm while we wait here!]\u2026 What is he saying?\u2026 That little!\u201c\u2026 You reported it to Yennekar? When?\u201d[It took me half a day to get here due to avoiding the eyes of the countless monsters, golems, and researchers\u2026 It must have been about two days by now!]Come to think of it, the story was like that.Originally, Ayla had been kidnapped and brought over to the laboratory, which meant that the Sage\u2019s Seal Resonance Transferal had gone as scheduled and that the first phase of the storyline had already begun.That meant that, according to the storyline, Taylee\u2019s rescue plan should already have been underway.[Lady Yennekar's face when she got angry was so beautiful, cute even\u2026 Though the coldness that was in her anger was real. That\u2019s why\u2026 She\u2019ll definitely be down here soon to rescue you!]\u201cEd Rothstaylor\u2026 Why is your expression like that\u2026?\u201d[Not only that, but that firefox merchant and the small magician that wears that big hat and comes to visit the camp so often seemed like they might join in as well\u2026 With those three, it was basically like having a million troops! So don\u2019t worry one bit, young master Ed! Even though I may be weak, I\u2019m quick to take action! Hahaha! HAHAHAHA!]I took a deep breath before hitting myself in the cheeks a few times.Ahh\u2026\u201cI changed my mind! I can\u2019t stay trapped here! I have to get out!\u201d[Y-Young master Ed?]Why did he go and do something that I didn\u2019t ask him to do?!Since this situation was urgent, I\u2019d put off scolding and complaining at him later.Anyway, I know the structure of the laboratory and where all the core items were quite well. It\u2019s quite obvious where they all were.\u201cListen well, Mugg\u2026\u201dI thought about hitting him with a big finger flick right away, but I decided to calm down first. I shouldn\u2019t be swayed by my emotions.I whispered all sorts of instructions to Mugg.[Ahh, I understand!]\u201cHey! Hey you! The researcher at the end of the hallway! Koom!\u201dClang! Clang! Clang!After catching my breath for a bit, I stood up and began to bang on the bars.Seeing me suddenly change expressions and start pounding on the bars, Ayla\u2019s expression became completely dumbfounded.There was no time for me to be bothered by that. I grabbed onto Mugg, holding him tightly as I continued making noise.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right! Get me out of here! I really can\u2019t stay here! I\u2019m not joking!\u201d\u201cEd Rothstaylor! You\u2019re too noisy. If you continue talking like that, that devil across from us will wake up.\u201dThe devil that was asleep on the other side of us was intentionally put in that condition using sleeping magic. But it wasn\u2019t a type of magic that was absolutely effective, so Koom came over just in case.\u201cYou were so quiet and collected before, but now you\u2019re making such a ruckus about how you're treated all of a sudden\u2026 Is it because you started to realize that the situation is scary after organizing your thoughts?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that! I told you I have to get out of here!\u201d\u201cAhhh, seriously\u2026 As expected, you are a student around that age after all. There\u2019s nothing I can do\u2026 Try and not worry too much. As long as you keep doing what you\u2019re told, we won\u2019t harm you in\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m being serious right now. You\u2019ll all be in big trouble if you don\u2019t let me out of here right now. It\u2019s not me who\u2019s going to get in trouble, it\u2019s you guys.\u201d\u201cTo start believing in you now\u2026 That\u2019s not right. Haah\u2026. Fine. It\u2019s weird to try and hold only my sense of logic in the situation anyway.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know how much of it was a lie and how much was the truth.The symbolic meaning that came from being the top student in each grade was significant.Those who maintained a hardworking academic lifestyle, with the appropriate results to prove it. Those who might become Silvenia Academy\u2019s greatest result were regarded with the most upright care within an academy environment.In addition, they were allowed to live in the most luxurious academic facility, Ophelis Hall. They were given priority when using all academic facilities and, as long as there was no major disciplinary action, their entire tuition and living expenses would be covered.They were even given more practical influence besides just a convenient lifestyle. Being recognized by representatives during the student presidential election, their single voice would actually count as dozens. They could even make official proposals to the school council.Usually, they didn\u2019t exercise such authority because they were busy studying. Also, there was the fact that it was quite embarrassing to do such things while they were still just students\u2026 Either way, the top students of each grade were talented individuals that couldn\u2019t easily be ignored.They were people who had the authority, social recognition, and power to go and do what they wanted anywhere, without feeling inferior in any way\u2026First year Lucy Mayreel, Second year Yennekar Palerover, Third year Duke Aldogar, Fourth year Amy\u2026 They were all individuals who had surpassed the average level of students, true to the name of Silvenia.Among them, the first- and second-year top students had a much more overwhelming amount of fighting power.With me being trapped, the subjugation force would be way too strong for the storyline\u2019s level, which was supposed to be taking place currently.Well, regardless of me, everyone was going to end up being completely destroyed\u2026 So, was there even a meaning to shout at them in the first place? They were going to be destroyed by Taylee anyway.\u201cIf you continue being noisy like that, I\u2019ll have to resort to using force. Stay quiet.\u201dClang!After threatening us by hitting the bars, Koom returned back to his place and sat down.\u201cWh-What\u2019s with you all of a sudden?! Ed Rothstaylor! You said earlier that if I just waited quietly then Taylee would definitely come to rescue us!\u201d\u201cShhh.\u201dAs I waved my arms and signaled for her to be quiet, Ayla curled up screeching with that same old overreaction of hers.In her eyes, just how far down had the image of me fallen\u2026?I didn\u2019t have time to think about that as I walked back further inside, my arms held out.[I-It was really there! The key holder! I brought it!]As I caught the attention of the guard, Mugg carefully appeared, going to the corner and taking a bundle of keys from the key holder.As I was already familiar with the main objects and core elements in Glast\u2019s secret laboratory, I could give Mugg proper instructions. After all, I'd broken into this same prison multiple times over.Anyway, I could effectively use my base knowledge of <Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster> like that.I picked up the bundle of keys as I carefully inserted them, one by one, so Koom wouldn\u2019t hear it.It didn\u2019t take long before one of the keys snapped into place and the door squeaked open.I stuck my head out and I glanced at Koom at the end of the hall. He didn't seem to have heard the door opening, as he was concentrating on reviewing all of the research data.\u201cAll right, let\u2019s escape, Mugg. While he\u2019s caught up in his research, he won\u2019t move one bit unless there\u2019s a fuss like before.\u201d[Indeed! As expected of young master Ed! What a quick analysis of the situation! I don\u2019t know just how you knew the exact location of the key, but in my eyes your detailed and appropriate instructions\u2026]Since it was obvious Mugg would just continue giving me a bunch of compliments, I quickly recalled him. Either way, he would keep following me. Next time, I\u2019d have to talk to him about doing things I didn\u2019t tell him to.After sneaking out of the slightly opened door, Ayla suddenly started to tremble and make a fuss. In a matter of minutes, I suddenly ended up with the key and escaped.The prison door was open. The person who opened it was none other than Ed Rothstaylor, a person that she considered an enemy. It must have been confusing.Squeak.I closed the prison door like it was before.\u201cY-You\u2026\u201d\u201cListen well, Ayla Triss.\u201dI spoke while looking straight at Ayla, who was still in the cell.\u201cYou will wait here.\u201dThere was no reason to take Ayla out as well. For the main storyline, Ayla needs to stay locked in for Taylee to come and rescue her.If the storyline was going to stay the same up to the point where they were at the top of the tower of magic power, then Ayla would need to remain as a hostage.But even then, I feel like complete trash having to just leave her locked up like that\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what kind of extreme behavior she would exhibit after I left her alone. At least for the time being, I needed to make her feel somewhat safe.\u201cOutside of this laboratory there are all kinds of experimented monsters, Celestial researchers, magic books with souls, as well as golems and guards that will be running around. It\u2019s dangerous to move alone, but if we end up getting caught together then even you will be caught up in serious danger. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you are being held as hostage, the best thing that you can do is be obedient. Don\u2019t go around getting hurt by rebelling in some sort of stupid fashion. If Koom finds out that I\u2019m missing while he\u2019s on guard\u2026 Just sell me out and tell him that I escaped. He\u2019ll believe that you were truly just sitting around here in your cell. He won\u2019t suspect you\u2026 That way, no harm will come to you.\u201dI locked the door as I put the key away.\u201cAnd either way, you can\u2019t run. Your legs don\u2019t have any strength, right?\u201dAyla curled up in surprise, perhaps because I had discovered that her legs were shaking.\u201cI'll take responsibility and bring down the rescue team, so you just sit here and breathe. Okay? I don\u2019t really need to explain the obvious to you, but this prison is the safest place in this secret laboratory. Trying to escape for no reason is like walking on a tightrope with your life on the line. Got it?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 Ed, you\u2019re\u2026\u201dPlease just answer with a yes or no instead of some random nonsense. Got it? That\u2019s all that I asked.As I pushed her a bit, Ayla continued trembling and nodded her head. Alright, at least she was acting a bit more obedient.\u201cAlright. Just hold your breath and keep silent. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dI slipped out, lowering my body and hiding myself behind the hallway cabinets.At the end of the hall, Koom continued to review the research data. I decided that I didn\u2019t have another choice but to match my timing with his. I\u2019d have to exit near his desk on his next patrol.It might have seemed like I was literally putting my life on the line, but there was a reason for me to take action.Yeah, to be blunt, I honestly kind of expected some sort of change in the flow of the storyline.Looking back on all the previous episodes I was caught up in, there was no way I could honestly think that everything would go smoothly and without incident.I was just relieved that the situation was progressing rather smoothly. But there was no doubt that something had gotten twisted.If it was just a slight change, somehow I would be able to manage it.My specs had risen quite a bit, so as long as I made good use of my future knowledge, I should have been able to handle most of the problems that would arise.As for Yennekar and Lortel\u2019s involvement\u2026 I\u00a0should\u00a0have been able to solve it as long as I could meet up with them and explain things well.However, there were bound to be variables that I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle with my own two hands.I took a deep breath.Silvenia's Failed Swordmaster, Act 2\u2019s Final Chapter. The Glast Subjugation.In that storyline, if you got caught up in a certain route then you wouldn\u2019t be able to escape a bad ending.\u201cThat small magician who wears that big hat and comes to visit the camp so often seemed to be joining\u2026\u201dThe first-year top student, and Act 3\u2019s final boss. The extraordinary genius, Lucy Mayreel.Her participation in the battle was by no means good news.The problem didn\u2019t stem from the bosses that she would casually sweep away with her tremendous power.If there was suddenly a change or some type of variable that was not originally in the main storyline, it could be solved in some way or another.After all, most of the \u2018bad endings\u2019 that already existed were things that I could work out in some way or another.However, there were definitely a few bad ending routes that were difficult to solve with my position, no matter what I did.Bad Ending number 27, \u2018Lazy Lucy.\u2019The conditions for it were that Professor Glast and Lucy Mayreel encountered each other in some way after the incident.A route in which Professor Glast, who would be pushed into a corner, ended up persuading Lucy to join his side and making her become an enemy\u2026 Once that started, a bad ending would occur after the battle with Lucy.After listening to Professor Glast\u2014who had already given up on everything\u2014and his final offer, Lucy would suddenly grow extremely hostile.You were not meant to win in a face-off against Lucy Mayreel in Act 2.As for a way to beat her during Act 2\u2026 Even though countless professionals and dedicated users agonized for over hundreds of hours, trying to find a means to win, no one had succeeded.No matter what\u2026 I have to somehow stop Professor Glast from meeting Lucy Mayreel.* * *\u201cUsing Mugg, I can feel them down in the underground waterways. The reaction I got from the school's faculty and other professors was rather indifferent\u2026 I think I\u2019ll have to go and see for myself. You\u2019re going to come help me too, right Lucy? I\u2019d feel so relieved if I knew you were coming.\u201dLucy started to wonder if she really needed her help. Yennekar Palerover was already strong enough, and Lucy was an extremely lazy individual.But there was something strangely powerful in the words Yennekar Palerover had spoken.Hearing that lively, over-the-top tone of voice of hers, with that strangely serious expression, even Lucy\u2014who had no interest in the world\u2014felt moved.She was starting to feel an emptiness inside of her in the first place.\u201cEughaham\u201dLying on the roof of the cabin, which was made with poor craftsmanship, she stretched her body and made a chicken-like sound.Holding her witch\u2019s hat in her arms, she shook her head with messy eyes. Lucy turned upside down as she stared blankly at the campfire.The campfire that hadn\u2019t been lit for a few days.While she didn\u2019t know if it was a big deal or not, she did love hearing its crackling sound as she took her naps.She also liked the pungent smell and bitter taste of the beef jerky, and the way he would pick her up and carry her when she was lying down and sleeping deeply, throwing her onto her bed\u2026 Well, it was a bit annoying, but it was very comfortable overall.Lucy, who looked up at the starry sky for a while and rolled her small body over, suddenly remembered the old days. The back of an old man with wrinkled fingers.A large and clear full moon was high in the sky. The girl, who was kicking her feet in the air and looking up at the moon, had already become a part of the landscape.Before long, a faint voice seeped through the night air like paint.\u201cI miss him.\u201dWhat\u2019s lost is lost.Even though she knew the fact that loneliness, which was something that would show up from time to time, was something that couldn\u2019t be shaken out of one's heart no matter how strong they may be\u2026He has already gone.The time to be heartbroken over that established fact had already passed.Nevertheless, the loneliness that person had left behind left a mark on her small heart.Even if she knew that she couldn\u2019t see him anymore, it was an entirely different matter.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Inf",
