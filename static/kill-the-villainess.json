    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 1Whether you want it or not, everyone is supposed to be born into the world. I was born that way, and I didn\u2019t live by doing what I wanted to do, but I\u2019ve lived just as normal and happy.However, life is often unpredictable, and some of them are absurd enough to be broadcasted on radio stories to win prizes or spread around the Internet community as a laughing stock.I came to this world in the blink of an eye. A world where the Crown Prince still exists, where the warrior walks through this street, where there is faith and magic. To be exact, the world of common romance novels that I read at my friend\u2019s house the day before yesterday.I opened my eyes as the only villain there, the only daughter of the Marquis, the childhood friend and fianc\u00e9e of the Crown Prince, Eris Mis\u00e9rian, who is jealous of the female protagonist.Some women may have dreamt of such a world once, and some women may have decided to live earnestly here since they cannot help it.However, I have no confidence in loving this world. So, let\u2019s die as soon as possible, and return to my world.***\u201cLady, are you awake?\u201dIs it because I am an agnostic person looking for God? I earnestly hoped to get myself back at this point, but I still opened my eyes in the novel today.Instead of hearing my mother\u2019s voice that I wanted to hear, it was the voice of the maid that woke me up. My mouth, which has always been obstinate, is bent gently to me, but it did not impress me. The part-time job I did just to make ends meet was surprisingly useful in these places.\u201cHuh. Did you say that we would enter the Imperial Palace today?A polite smile hung awkwardly around my mouth.Because the main character and narrator of the novel was Helena, the heroine of the novel, I didn\u2019t know Eris\u2019s personality or surroundings.However, when they see that Eris was not particularly strange, I seem to have managed to imitate the nobleman.Getting dressed usually took about two hours, but today I had to go to the Imperial Palace, so I had to start preparing an hour earlier than usual. She\u2019s probably trying to do it to look beautiful to her fianc\u00e9, the Prince.It\u2019s all useless. The Crown Prince loves Helena, the mistress. From the moment I first met her until now.Her desperate devotion continues until the end of the book, finally reaching the end when Helena will be welcomed as the Empress. Eris, who loved the prince, or to be precise, was jealous of Helena, went crazy.Actually, this novel wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. It was a perfectly decent story to read if one was bored as it contained commonly recurring tropes and characters that reduced the story\u2019s perfection.There was no twist, no memorable narrative. Just a repetition of sweet excitement with three handsome and talented male lead candidates, and the vicious acts of Eris who interfered with them.Despite being another villainess who confronted the female lead, there was no such thing as the narrative of Eris.She was just full of inferiority, a person who unilaterally disliked the good Helena and did not reflect on herself until the end. She was more like a plot device as the heroine\u2019s ordeal instead of a human being.Eris eventually succeeded in poisoning Helena, but she dramatically returned from death because one of the male protagonists was the High Priest.Such a clich\u00e9 story. This is the story that Eris dies and Helena lives happily ever after, but everyone who likes Helena will be satisfied.\u201cWhat are you thinking, my lady?\u201dA woman who arranged Eris\u2019s hair after dressing up asked.This was exactly what I imagined Snow White to look like when I read it as a child, with black and rich hair, white skin, and bloody lips.A strange and beautiful woman was reflected in the mirror. It was scary.\u201cThinking that time is really slow.\u201d\u201cMy lady, you must be looking forward to your engagement ceremony?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dMy death is so painful.***\u201cA glorious afternoon, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Your Majesty, what a glorious afternoon it is, as you have waited for me.\u201dWhen I came out after greeting the Emperor, the prince\u2019s attendant and knight were waiting for me.Since the prince hates Eris so much, he might skip teatime at least once, but he inevitably kept his promise. This is because it was neither a promise to me nor a promise to the Emperor.\u201cEris! No, Lady Miserian! Oh my God!\u201dAn innocent and cheerful voice with a lovely smile greeted me. When her silvery hair fluttered lightly as if her sugar was melted and pulled out, the prince smiled and arranged her hair.It was a pair that matched well with, \u2018a glorious afternoon\u2019. The blonde prince warmly watched as Helena tied her hair, then turned a cold gaze to me.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s later than usual.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a glorious afternoon, Your Highness, Helena.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad the tea hasn\u2019t cooled down yet. Come on, sit down.\u201d\u201cStop being so formal to her, Helena. You\u2019re two are friends\u2026 right?\u201dHelena, whose eyes were filled with anticipation, and the Crown Prince, whose gaze looked as if he would slap my cheek if I shook my head, turned towards me at the same time. It was funny.The fallen Countess, who was a close friend of the Empress, accepted the position of the Crown Prince\u2019s nanny, and her daughter turned out to be Helena.Although she has the blood of a prestigious family, she is considered a commoner now.She hadn\u2019t even dreamed of drinking tea together in the original story, and she would use the prince\u2019s favor for her in order to be a nobleman.Originally, if we were following the development in the novel, Eris would attempt to catch the fault and then be expelled by the angry prince, but it was also tiring to cause such a disturbance.Regardless of whether I give Helena a verbal rebuke now or later, the Crown Prince would hate Eris, but I didn\u2019t have to lose my strength. So I gently turned to Helena.\u201cCold tea tastes bitter. Will you fill my cup?\u201d\u201cOh, sure Eris.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Has the young lady not learned how to pour tea at home? Or maybe she has discomfort in her hands?\u201dSeriously?The Prince opened his sharp eyes and glared at me because I asked his woman to work, but it is unfortunate that a person who has no regrets in life is not afraid to respond.Although the Marquis couple wasn\u2019t my real mom and dad, I was annoyed by the man in front of me who was immediately talking about family education.\u201cAs I said, Your Majesty, we\u2019re friends\u2026 is it against the law to ask a friend for a cup of tea?\u201d\u201c\u2026 You.\u201dWhen considering the law, he was at a disadvantage. The Crown Prince, who was about to yell at me with a wrinkled brow, shut up because of Helena\u2019s sudden intervention.\u201cYes, Alex. I went along because we are friends. If you keep grunting like that, would you like to pour the tea instead?\u201dThe Prince\u2019s lips were pouting with discontent when his words were lightly greeted with disdain.Then Helena patted his lips lightly with her index finger and middle finger. This was a sign of her own anger.It was very rude, but she was as lovely as a famous painting. Maybe that\u2019s why everyone loves Helena.According to the book\u2019s description, Helena was not hated for anything because of her unique innocence and straight personality.Even those who hated her would fall in love with Helena, reflecting on themselves and betraying Eris. At that point, it was not attractive but more like magic.\u201cAre you guys drinking without me?\u201d\u201cJason! Are you back already?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll stay in the capital for a while, it\u2019s a glorious afternoon, Your Majesty.\u201dWith a cheerful voice, Jason appeared, hugging the Prince and Helena at the same time.The eldest son of Duke, Jason was more famously known as a warrior. They are childhood friends, and Jason was one of the pitiful men who falls in love with Helena.In fact, Eris should have been kicked out after acting stupid. The scene of the three quietly unraveling the story is the content of the novel, but the two male protagonists hated me anyway, so I was going to stretch out a little more.\u201cOh, my God, I\u2019ve been rude. Lady Mis\u00e9rian, you\u2019re still beautiful.\u201dLaughing and chuckling while he treated people as if they were invisible. But then Jason raised his head and greeted me as well.He did not forget the wink, befitting the nickname of \u201cthe Empire\u2019s best playboy\u201d. He is handsome, but it wasn\u2019t funny.\u201cA glorious afternoon, Sir Kazar.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any contribution to the Duke of Kazar, and the title is not suited me. Jason is enough.\u201d\u201cAs the Prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, how dare I?\u201dWhen she gave strength to the word fianc\u00e9e, Jason\u2019s eyebrows were raised.He peeked at the Crown Prince\u2019s expression. The Crown Prince was a man who could not hide his feelings. At least in front of both Eris and Helena.One because this blunt person openly loves Helena, and he doesn\u2019t like her.\u201cI see many things. Your Highness.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need that. The attention of others does not affect me.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t want to deal with him. Even if I got angry at children being childish than me, I could only lose my energy.However, it was unbearable to see the Crown Prince raising his lips as if he had won. So I smiled more calmly on purpose and said it like a fling.\u201cThere is only one person under the sky who can do that\u2026 And he also looks for comfort in silence.\u201d (T/N: Eris talks about the emperor).\u201cEris!\u201dHelena called her name in surprise. The Prince held back his anger and clenched his fist.Jason stood beside the Crown Prince and focused on me, in case of emergency.Indeed, it could have been upsetting to say that he was not an Emperor.If you scratched my stomach, I should have felt relieved, but somehow I felt bitter. Strange, I\u2019m sure Eris was their childhood friend.Eris was perfectly treated as an uninvited guest in this room, or almost a foreign object. If you were the real Eris, you might have been hurt.I slowly got up from my seat while looking at them. With a subtle smile to Helena, who looked at me with her eyes wide open, I added-\u201cThank you for the tea, Lady Antebellum, but you shouldn\u2019t talk down to me and His Highness in crowded places. There is social status to be considered.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2Helena hugged the Prince, who was almost ready to rush at me. Then he bowed his head in a timid way and nodded. Even the sight was cute, like a dog in the rain.She smiled as if she were satisfied with his answer and I slowly returned to the carriage and sat down.The heavy accessories, tight corsets, and slightly thick makeup were all heavy. I looked out the window and held my breath.Helena, who was born with such a good heart, always suffered losses. It was okay though.There were three of the best men in the world who would devote themselves to her.A stranger who wants to die soon, wouldn\u2019t be a big problem.The day has dawned.It was a perfect day to kill myself.In conclusion, I didn\u2019t kill myself. There are many reasons for this, mainly, if you try to kill yourself, you can\u2019t die.Not only can you not kill yourself, if you try to cut your wrist, or fall from a high place, or take poison, one does not die.A hanging beam or branch broke when I tried to hang myself. If I shot a gun, the gunpowder did not work, and if I ate poison, despite it being actually bad, I slept well instead.In a world where supernatural phenomena is taken for granted, causality seemed to interfere.The incidents in which I tried to kill myself does not disappear, but it was modified to be an unfortunate accident if it went far enough to affect the story.For example, if I openly stabbed others in the stomach with a knife, a mysterious man suddenly appeared and stabbed them with a knife too, and fortunately, he was the one caught in the wrong.When I fell from the roof, the horses stationed below picked me up. Despite the apparent suicide attempt, everyone thought I had lost my footing.Supernatural phenomena must be dealt with by supernatural phenomena. Even when I was in Korea, I\u2019ve never seen a tarot card before, yet in here, I can\u2019t do anything to die.I gave a little tip to the maid and asked her to find a fortune teller who said she was good.After a series of \u201caccidents\u201d and the Crown Prince\u2019s coldness, the maid was delighted when I said I was going to see a fortune teller.She seemed to want me to change my mood, regardless of the fact that she believed in the point.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve been out, so why don\u2019t you dress up a little bit more?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be right back after I meet a fortune teller.\u201d\u201cOh, come on. It\u2019s in the back alley of the main street anyway, so look at the clothes and accessories. You can eat sweet snacks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll think about it now you\u2019re saying that. There must be some snacks you want to eat, right?\u201dWhen I asked the maid, who wanted to choose clothes, she touched her hair as her face turned red and answered back.\u201cDo you think I am doing this because I want to eat sweets? Ahem, there are some things I want to eat with sweets, but sweets originally make people feel better\u2026 I\u2019m just saying I want you to feel better.\u201dIt was a smile full of love. With a bitter feeling, she nodded her head, and the woman knelt down and helped her put on her chosen shoes.\u201cWe still have plenty of time before sunset, so don\u2019t rush.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my lady.\u201dEveryone in the mansion loves Eris. Did Eris love them, too? I thought it would be nice if I loved them.The streets were crowded with people. When I examined it, I recognized it from the time when the invention of the gun came out, so the Empire was closer to modern times than to the Middle Ages.All the roads in the castle were built with stone, and even in a country where there is basically a diplomatic relationship, magical engineering was developed, so there were trams in the castle and street lights that lit up in the night.It\u2019s ridiculous for a country that believes in gods but rejects wizards to be able to develop magical engineering, but for now, those who study magical engineering are called engineers rather than wizards. It is similar to alchemists, so to speak.Whatever it may be, it was both strange and envious from the standpoint of a modern person who lived on Earth that it generates energy such as electricity without the risk of environmental pollution.Of course, the story is about the highly developed civilization of an Empire that developed magical engineering, and where other small and medium-sized Kingdoms were still far behind the Empire.No, maybe this prosperity and development of the Empire was achieved by squeezing other Kingdoms.As expected, when you ride something, you have to think about it while looking out the window. Before I knew it, I arrived at the back alley of the busy street and the Knight opened the door.I came out holding the knight\u2019s hand and looked around. Even if it was a back alley, it was not a chaotic atmosphere.Rather than colorful and expensive items like the store at the roadside, there were many cute shops opened by ordinary people. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for Eris, but for me, this side was more affectionate and interesting.\u201cShall we wait?\u201d\u201cNo, go back to the mansion.\u201d\u201cBut my lady, wasn\u2019t it dangerous the other day? It\u2019s dangerous to go around alone.\u201d\u201cDo I need to say it twice? I told you to go back because it was annoying.\u201dI couldn\u2019t even die anyway. If there is a family knight next to me, I will not be able to ask what I really want to ask.The Knight hesitated for a while, then asked me to call for pick up when I finished my business, because I said I would look around for a while.I decided to accept the compromise because it would only make me tired if I was more stubborn. Then slowly, I went into the store in front of me.It was clearly a shop inside the building, but it was a shop that felt like a tent or a hut. My eyes were quickly drawn to the shelves full of mysterious and sparkling clutter, and I was about to unconsciously reach out to the items.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch it, sweetheart.\u201dWhen I looked back in a horrified surprise, a woman with red hair and white skin slowly walked out. The thin black dress and the bright jewel necklace matched very well, so she was more like a rich family figure than fortune teller.\u201cIf you\u2019re really good at it, you know what I\u2019m worried about.\u201d\u201cWell, Lady Miseran, no, should I call you a poor stranger?\u201dSurprised by that, I stared at the fortune teller. The fortune teller smiled, grabbed my frozen hand, and slowly led me down the stairs to the basement.I felt overwhelmed by the dim lighting and cold air. She sat me on one of her sofas and she sat on the opposite side, on her wooden chair.\u201cYou know who I am, so things will be easier. I want to go back to where I was.\u201d\u201cPoor stranger, it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. Smelling your soul, you\u2019ve already tried a lot of things.\u201d\u201cSmelling?\u201d\u201cYou wanted to break your soul, but the world would not allow it.\u201dShe took some medicinal herbs out of the cupboard, put it in a large pot in the corner, and stirred it. She looked like a witch rather than a fortune teller.Before long, the fortune teller gave me a bowl containing an unknown violet liquid, and it smelled awful that I really didn\u2019t want to drink.\u201cGulp it down.\u201d\u201cDo you know what this will do?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s poison, isn\u2019t it good for you?\u201dTrue. She wasn\u2019t wrong, so I had no choice but to shut my senses and drink it all at once.It tasted terribly sour. When I finished and closed my mouth, the fortune teller smiled and put sweet jelly in my mouth.\u201cYou seem to have noticed, but I\u2019m not just a fortune teller.\u201dThe fortune teller took off her lace gloves and held her hand slightly closed. At that moment, a very beautiful and strange pattern shone in her hand, as if burning.Well, if you consider the form, it\u2019s more like an art.\u201cLet me introduce myself, outlander. I\u2019m Medea, the last witch of the land.\u201dWitch? This was a little interesting. It was because she was a character who did not appear in the novel. She looked at me with a shine in her eyes and then laughed out loud.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of questions about me, so I\u2019ll answer only two questions.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, you said you were the last witch of the earth, so there is no witch other than yourself? Or is it somewhere else?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the last one in the Empire. Everyone lives far away from the persecution of the Empire. But it\u2019s not a lot.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have a castle. Don\u2019t you have any offspring?\u201d\u201cYes, there are cases where children are left behind, but they are rare. We only call each other by name because each individual\u2019s presence is important. And they\u2019re all considered sisters.\u201dThere were many things I wanted to ask, but I held back. Medea served her jelly one more as if she knew it was good. I asked as I rolled it in my hand, which had white powder on the surface.\u201cIs there any way I can go back?\u201d\u201cWe can only help you if you\u2019re willing to die like you\u2019ve tried. But it\u2019s my first time seeing a poor stranger in my life, so I think I should ask my sisters.\u201d\u201cHow long does it take?\u201d\u201cIt takes about fifteen days. Please understand that the distant sisters live beyond the continent, so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to die?\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ask me that. Poor Stranger\u2026 You don\u2019t seem to know the difference between magic and theology yet. Theology is the study of creation, and magic is the study of anomalies. If you want to make a way that\u2019s not there, you should go to the temple and ask for directions. Of course, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a way out there. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t know about\u2026\u201dI nodded and gave out the money I had prepared. Medea bowed down, but I insisted.\u201cI\u2019m giving it to you to be burdened. I don\u2019t believe your secret is more fatal than mine, so you won\u2019t try to take advantage of it.\u201d\u201cIf you say it\u2019s for my life, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll call you if I find out anything, so always keep the mirror by your side.\u201dWhile I was here, I walked a little bit to stop by the dessert shop that the maid told me about. It was a huge store worthy of the rave reviews that called it the best store in the Empire.I was already tired by the time I saw people waiting in line. Even if the snacks were delicious, I would just go back, but I lost my balance due to the crowd.A high-heeled foot was twisted and someone held my falling body from behind.\u201cHey, are you all right?\u201dDark hair, dark skin I know this man.High Priest Hybrid, who saved Helena by dedicating all of his devotion to the subject with a better heart than anyone else, and sincerely praying for Eris to fall to hell.You\u2019re smiling at me now, without even knowing the future where you\u2019re going to hate me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 03HubrisWhen Hubris\u2019 eyes met mine, the awkward smile on his mouth faded. Slowly he put his lips near my ear. And asked,\u201c\u2026\u2026Who are you?\u201dIt pierced me.My head was spinning. I was almost suspicious that I wasn\u2019t getting enough rest. Should I be honest and get help? Or is it the right answer to pretend not to know?If Hubris is on my side, no, if I was in the same position as when I met the witch today, I would have confessed my situation without even thinking about it.But Hubris was on Helena\u2019s side, which meant he would soon become my enemy. Can I give my biggest knife to a man who will one day be my enemy? The answer is \u2018no\u2019. I wanted to die. For it to be clean and painless.When I think about the fact that I\u2019m not actually Eris, things will get troublesome if I\u2019m also caught by people who don\u2019t like me.Since it is a country with advanced magical engineering, I may be tortured as a living experiment to see how other souls can enter the body, or they would treat me as a crazy person, imprison me in a remote estate, and watch until I grow old and die,Even if Hubris continued, later, if he spoke to the Crown Prince, there would be no need to see the result. The Crown Prince was even more, not a person who would look after me.\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that you, a priest, want to know about an unmarried noble woman?\u201d\u201c\u2026.What I\u2019m talking about is not your identity\u201d\u201cNot my identity?\u201dI insisted. I should have answered right away, but it was too late to regret. However, a person with a loud voice wins this kind of fight,He looked up and looked away, perhaps because he had never met such a woman. In addition, people\u2019s eyes slowly gathered.As a substitute, Eris is quite a celebrity as the fianc\u00e9e of the Crown Prince. So it was suspicious to chat with a man.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been interrogating me in a terrible manner, and you\u2019re hiding the reason.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not interrogating! How can I be an interrogator in the body of a priest?\u201dI brought my face close to Hubris, who looked up in surprise. In fact, it was almost half a gamble, because it could lead to a rumor of a prostitute seducing a high priest. Still, I was confident that I would win this gamble.In the novel, Hubris was terribly indecisive and conscious of others, and was the only coward who could not even confess to Helena, and it took all that he hadAnd according to the description in the novel, unlike Helena, Eris looks scary.\u201cI feel that I am being interrogated. If I grope the priest\u2019s chest right now, is it not assault because a woman touched it?\u201d\u201c\u2026It must have been my misunderstanding. I apologize for the slip of the tongue.\u201d\u201cI accept it.\u201dI don\u2019t think I can buy dessert today. I left the shop because I wanted to, leaving an embarrassed Hubris. It was difficult to find evidence that I was not Eris after trying to be next to him for no reason.The eyes of other people were also a concern. This store was a place where many nobles and servants of nobles came and went,Even now, Eris\u2019s reputation is not very good, so everyone is probably talking about having a good story. People\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s not really my body, and I\u2019m going to die anyway.However, I thought a lot on my way back by carriage. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to ask now if it was Hubris who would love Helena later anyway?The witch said there might be a way to go back without dying. And if you know that, you have to go to the temple.The temple is not easily accessible to the public. Aristocrats were only able to enter them after rigorous procedures and thorough screening.In the novel, even Helena, the heroine, was not able to step in because of her low status.However, in Helena\u2019s case, one of the male protagonists, Hubris, was the High Priest. Therefore it wasn\u2019t a big problem\u2026I should have caught Hubris and asked him what he saw in Eris, if I was a stranger and had a way to go back to the world. It was better if I could go back alive.I am not afraid to die, but the pain I inflicted on my body to die was vividly memorable. It would hurt terribly.Nevertheless, I tried because I thought everything would be over when I opened my eyes again. But instead, when I woke up in the same world, it was even more painful.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI lost a good opportunity because I was seized with fear. When I realized so, there was a groan of grief. It\u2019s already a missed opportunity, so I have to pray for another chance.To find out the next opportunity, I need to know the contents of the original, but it was hard to remember, though the general storyline was there, I read the novel as if one was passing by briefly,Moreover, the majority of the descriptions were focused on Helena, and it was hard to guess because there was no incident without Helena.Since we had tea together a week ago, I think it\u2019s still the beginning of the novel\u2026 If I knew this would happen, I should have read it more seriously.\u201cWe\u2019re here. My lady.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cOh, there will be a knight swearing ceremony soon. Will you not pick up personal knights thisyear?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWhile holding the knight\u2019s hand and descending the carriage, a question suddenly occurred to me. Was there such a purpose for me?As she stared at the knight with a quaint face, the knight smiled and said,\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to take the oath, but it is more convenient for both the knight and the noble to have a personal knight. The numbers are strictly limited, but you can also enable them for private use.\u201dI was a little bit overwhelmed by that, but still, I shook my head. It is a life that will soon die anyway. If you try to increase the number of people around you, it is obvious that it will only cause discomfort.At my refusal, the knight responded as if he had expected it, but with a little regret,\u201cMy apologies, there are a lot of people who want to be the lady\u2019s escort.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026My?\u201d\u201cOf course. Isn\u2019t it the romance of a knight to give one\u2019s life to a beautiful lady?\u201d\u201cIt is truly selfish and uselessly romantic.\u201dAre you saying that if it\u2019s not beautiful, it\u2019s not worth your life? No, in the first place, I felt reluctant to carry the weight of other people\u2019s lives, like a burden.Why are you trying to sacrifice yourself? Men\u2019s way of thinking, in the past and now, couldn\u2019t be understood. I tried to step through the door and looked around the knight.\u201cSomeone may love that romance, but not me. So let the knight sacrifice his life to her.\u201dI don\u2019t intend to be someone\u2019s romance, nor to carry it on my back.The morning was bright and I\u2019m still Eris. I thought about it carefully, and came to the conclusion that it would be better to be pre-emptive and tell Hubris before the relationship gets worse.If you ask him to keep it a secret, he\u2019s not going to go around bragging about it at the lady\u2019s request.I was thinking about putting in an application in the temple, but the process was so complicated and I was worried that the contents would leak out.Which means I\u2019m supposed to run into Hubris again, most likely by chance\u2026\u2026In the novel, Hubris usually appeared in the palace and yesterday\u2019s dessert shop. Fortunately, they can both be visited frequently if I want to.Hubris didn\u2019t like sweet things much, but he secretly enjoyed the expensive desert because it was considered a luxury to some extent here.After Helena, he no longer hid his taste because she cheered that eating sweets was not bad. It was Hubris, who was too tied to his life as a priest, which led to a surge in his favor for Helena,I didn\u2019t want to take away Helena\u2019s love event, but I thought it would be better if I met him at the dessert shop. It was difficult to talk at the palace for no other reason than to step on a landmine called \u201cThe Crown Prince\u201d.In addition, if Eris was misunderstood as seducing Hubris for no reason, she might have suffered from a tantrum for three days.\u201cMy Lady, you must get ready. His Majesty has sent us a message asking us to enter the palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026His Majesty?\u201d\u201cYes, you have to be prepared, so you can\u2019t keep him waiting.\u201dSimpler decorations were made at a faster pace than usual. Everyone must have been embarrassed by the sudden royal command, and all the women in the mansion were mobilized. I had motion sickness when fifteen hands shook me around.When I entered the Imperial Palace after a great deal of trouble, the attendant took me straight to the Emperor\u2019s office.\u201cYour Majesty, Lady Mis\u00e9ran, the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Mis\u00e9ran and the fianc\u00e9e of His Highness Crown Prince, is waiting for you to see her.\u201d\u201cLet her in.\u201dTaking a breath, then wearing a smile of hospitality with the edges of my mouth, I slowly stepped through the door opened by the attendant. The light pouring over the large window was reflected in the white marble and gold frame.As the Emperor was sitting with the window against his back, he was illuminated by the light and looked more dignified. The Emperor, who had nice white hair and beard, said in a friendly voice.\u201cA glorious afternoon, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you in a hurry. Wasn\u2019t it uncomfortable to come?\u201d\u201cA call from His Majesty is not uncomfortable. It is always a pleasure.\u201d\u201cYou too have come to know how to say good things pleasing to the ears. No other thing, I called because there was something I wanted to discuss about your coming-of-age ceremony.\u201dThe people treated 21-year-olds, whose physical and mental growth was complete, as adults. This is because they were not eager to treat children who have yet grown into adulthood by sending them to production sites and wars like other countries.Eris is the youngest character in the novel, so everyone probably became adults last year. By the way, the Emperor\u2019s words had just given me a sense of where the story is,\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, but I\u2019d like to have a coming-of-age ceremony at the Imperial Palace. Do you have a place in mind?\u201dEven if it bounces, it will be according to the Emperor\u2019s will. I shook my head coolly because didn\u2019t want to argue with the Emperor.The reason why the Emperor wanted to hold a coming-of-age ceremony at the Imperial Palace is because of the rumor that the Crown Prince cares about Helena, a commoner, and looks down on me\u2026 because this fact is widely known in the country.This was a disgrace to Marquis Mis\u00e9ran, one of the centers of the aristocracy and one of the Empire\u2019s top powers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 04 Are You Jealous?In fact, Eris\u2019 father, the Marquis of Mis\u00e9ran, did not say anything, but he was very angry. The Crown Prince\u2019s favorite wasn\u2019t the center of the Emperor\u2019s faction. It was even more so because it was Helena of the Antebellum family, which he destroyed by himself.The engagement of the Crown Prince and Eris was a political card that the Emperor offered to appease the aristocracy, but with the Prince coming out like that, the Emperor was in trouble, Therefore, the emperor wanted to express that there is no problem with this marriage by directly hosting my coming-of-age ceremony at the Imperial Court,\u201cThank you for your consideration. It will be an honor for the family that will never be again.\u201d\u201cI heard that the Crown Prince cares about his nanny\u2019s daughter.\u201dThe emperor seemed to want to deal with all the trouble since she met him. It started to give me a headache.\u201cYou mean Lady Antebellum.\u201d\u201cDo you know her?\u201d\u201cWhen I was young, she used to play house with His Highness the Crown Prince and Lord, Kazar.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the nanny. The Empress took a bad habit of caring for the baby.\u201dThe Emperor kicked his tongue and tapped the desk lightly. I felt a little bit suffocated because I was eager to leave.He is now acting up like a loving grandfather, but the Emperor once killed another prince with his own hands. The reason was that he was plotting treason, but despite insufficient evidence, there was no reconsideration or hesitation,The Empress was also involved, but she was able to survive because she had Alecto, the current Crown Prince, in her bellyThe Emperor still loves the Empress, but it was also understandable that the Empress, who lost her son overnight, clung to the nanny or the current prince.\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYes, there\u2019s nothing to be envious of.\u201dThe Emperor beckoned me to come near. When I approached him, he held my hand tightly with his warm hands. It was too tight and a little painful.\u201cA man\u2019s love is more fleeting than a flower of the season. What is more important than love is the position and power that the man will bring.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the agreement with your father had been signed, so don\u2019t be too impatient. It is you who will become the Crown Princess anyway and take the place of the Empress. Your people will fill the palace, and your child will become the Crown Prince.\u201dAt first glance, he seemed to be soothing me, but it was actually a threat to me, or \u201cEris\u201d. The threat of giving up if you have someone else in your mind, the threat of the Imperial Court having that power, the threat of Eris being at the Crown Prince\u2019s mercy,But the Emperor chose the wrong person. When making threats, it is important to understand, what your opponent is afraid of.I\u2019m not afraid of death. In fact, it didn\u2019t matter if the Mis\u00e9ran family was exterminated. They\u2019re Eris\u2019s family, not mine.No matter how many terrible things your boss says, his subordinates have to laugh it off. There is no labor office, so there is no place to report.Originally, I wanted to talk back to him because of my temper, but I endured being the eldest daughter of the Marquis.I still had a little hope that I could get out alive. I really just want to live my life after I meet Hubris and get a definitive answer that I can\u2019t go out unless I die.The nagging given on New Year\u2019s and Chuseok (P/N: Korean Thanksgiving) under the disguise of well-wishes were a big help. Managing a smile, I replied,\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. The Crown Prince has a good mate. The Imperial Family will be in charge of preparing for the coming-of-age ceremony, so keep that in mind.\u201dAs I walked a little bit out of the office, I was a little worried about whether I would run into the Crown Prince and if he would become embarrassed when I was here even though he was still my fiance.I was upset because I was told that he doesn\u2019t need all the women in broad daylight and that getting married is the best, but if the Prince was annoyed, I don\u2019t think I can really manage my facial expression. Yes, today is not the day.I was walking to the carriage that was waiting for me, when I heard someone running from behind and my shoulder was suddenly tightly grabbed,\u201cKyaa!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dI was so frightened that I pushed her, and then heard a new scream. Looking back, Helena, whose pretty silver hair hung around her face, was crying.She looked up at me with tears in her big eyes, hoping that I would help her up, but I couldn\u2019t say a word because I was so astonished. As I stared pathetically, she woke up with a whimper,\u201cI was surprised, Lady Antebellum, to see you run in the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just because I wanted to see Eris, so I want to\u2026\u201d,\u201cIf you want to say hello, just call me. You\u2019re not a child. How come your hand comes before your words?\u201d\u201cAlec likes it, so \u2026\u201dOh, my gosh\u2026 My head is aching. I felt like I\u2019m seeing my five-year-old cousin. As I lowered my eyes, the skin on Helena\u2019s palm seemed to have peeled when she fell, thus it turned red and showed blood.Helena quickly hid her hands behind her. Luckily, she didn\u2019t seem to be seriously injured when I pulled her hand to look at it.\u201cLook. Are you hurt?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHelena looked at me with a confused face, shook her head quickly, and laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s all right, the Royal Doctor can just take a look at it later.\u201d\u201cHow does the Royal Doctor, who treats only the Imperial Family, see Lady Antebellum\u2019s wounds?\u201d\u201cHe likes me\u2026 because he likes me.\u201dI was worried for nothing. I dropped Helena\u2019s hand, a little annoyed.I did care about Helena, who is loved by everyone, but I had to worry first about my fate, as one who couldn\u2019t even die.She was a person who would live very well, whether with the Crown Prince or meeting Hubris, who called in the Emperor to heal her, she was a very well-off personAs I turned around and walked away. Helena followed me, staring at me. She murmured in a high, thin voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026Eris, are you angry?\u201d\u201cUh, please don\u2019t. It\u2019s annoying.\u201dAnd why does she keep talking informally? I was worried I\u2019d make a harsher remark, so instead of walking, I stopped and stared at Helena,If you had to take it off anyway, you\u2019d better finish it quickly before they get upset for no reason, Even in Korea, I hated people with smiling faces,\u201cLady Antebellum, don\u2019t you know why I use honorifics to you, though you\u2019re a commoner? As the eldest daughter of the Marquis, I deserve to be addressed with courtesy as one belonging to the Royal Court\u2026 Nevertheless! The reason I give you honorifics is because the Empress and the Crown Prince love you. I respect them, not you.\u201d\u201cBut, but Eris\u2026 we\u2019re friends. I want to be close to you\u2026.\u201d\u201cFriends? Sigh\u2026\u201dIn the novel, Helena claimed to be a friend of Eris, an ironclad friend. But in her retrospective scenes, Eris was not described in a single line.Both sad and joyful memories were focused on Alecto and Jason. Either Helena\u2019s standard of a friend is ridiculously low, or she did not care at all when Eris was with her. Every night when she went to bed, Eris must have hated Helena,Well, when I saw it, it seemed like a setting that the author put in mindlessly for a villainess character who had everything yet hits a friend\u2019s back.I don\u2019t even know about Eris\u2019 life, but it\u2019s funny to take revenge on Helena while I\u2019m on this side, so let\u2019s just stop talking to Helena,\u201cLet\u2019s break up, then.\u201d\u201c\u2026..What?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s break up. I don\u2019t want to be friends with you. We\u2019re not even friends in the first place.\u201d\u201cWhy, why, why? Is it because I\u2019m close to the Crown Prince?\u201dI was very irritated. I don\u2019t want the Crown Prince! You can have him! I\u2019m making someone abandon a friend for a man! Is this all you need to do if you have a pretty face?As I was trembling with bewilderment, someone turned me around roughly. The cold, hard face of the Crown Prince looked down at me. I didn\u2019t want to lose, so I glared at him.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9ran, you haven\u2019t changed. No, it\u2019s getting shameless.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a glorious afternoon, Your Highness. It\u2019s a virtue for those of high status.\u201dIt was a funny statement, but honestly, I was annoyed and answered in a slightly sarcastic tone, and the Crown Prince became furious,\u201cDo you dare to speak before me now?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, that\u2019s why I can discuss my status in front of you. You\u2019re engaged to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just an engagement! Do you think the Imperial Family will tolerate the arrogant act for a marriage that has not yet been confirmed, as if you have already become a Crown Princess? Any engagement like this can be destroyed. There are many who can be my fiance if not you!\u201d\u201cAlec, stop it\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m wrong. Eris, no\u2026 Lady Mis\u00e9ran wanted to give me the code of law\u2026.\u201dIn the meantime, Helena poured gas into the fire without notice. While stopping the Crown Prince, she exposed the wound from her fall a while ago.On behalf of Helena, who could not answer the Crown Prince who questioned who did it, someone shouted at the top of her voice,\u201cLady Mis\u00e9ran did it!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI saw Lady Mis\u00e9ran pushing Helena with my own eyes! So I brought Your Majesty in before things got worse.\u201dWhen I looked at her, a small, devious woman quickly went and hid behind the Prince,And then I smiled at Helena, \u2018Did I do well?\u2019. It was a fact that I pushed, but Helena\u2019s surprise, attack on me first was completely omitted from the statement,The Crown Prince slapped me before I could refute anything. My head turned with a smack, it was a loud sound. As if the inside of my mouth had been torn, a metallic taste spread, and my cheeks burned.I was slapped in the face. I\u2019ve never been beaten by my parents, but I was slapped on the cheek by a guy I just met.\u201cEris!\u201d\u201cNow that you\u2019ve scratched mine first, it\u2019s only fair to give you a scratch, right?\u201d (T/N: \u201cmine\u201d he means she scratched \u201chis Helena\u201d / \u201cMy Helena\u201d),If that\u2019s the case, ask Helena to hit me, else I don\u2019t know what\u2019s fair,Come to think of it, I think I read this part in a novel. When I read it, I wondered if there were any crazy people like this, but after having experienced it myself, it made my blood boil*.*[T/N: \u201cYama turned around. \u2018OFOP is referring to yama as in which is apparently \u2018mountain\u2019 in japanese. The \u2018SCF\u2019 means spinning\u2026.so literally it says \u2018mountain is spinning, the \u2018mountain\u2019 is referring to your head, so 0F0 ECH (according to namu and other korean blogs) means something like \u2018LOOD LET 012/01 I 2 SACP = blood in your head) boiling from anger.]I know I feel the same way, I am just about to blow up\u2026\u2026 But if I\u2019m going to live my life, I\u2019m going to have to do it only after getting confirmation from Hubris\u2026\u2026Anyway, since I was going to be executed at the end of the novel. Should I just slap the Crown Prince and hang him now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They would be saying I was out of my mind, and at this point, I didn\u2019t think that Eris would die by hanging. To avoid suspicion, I had to pretend to be Eris.What would Eris say? How did she behave? I was going to seriously think about it, but the prince couldn\u2019t stand it and tried to grab Helena\u2019s wrist and leave. Hence I just grabbed him with words. If I sent these two away like this, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep because it\u2019s unfair.\u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019re not marrying me, but a descendant of Mis\u00e9ran. I\u2019m not marrying His Highness, I\u2019m marrying the Imperial family. You\u2019ll get married to me even if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dEris seemed to have built up her pride. At least that\u2019s what I read of her. A child who expects an innocent ending that she will eventually choose herself.The Crown Prince stopped walking and turned his head at my words. He had a face full of ridicule.\u201cNot me, but the Imperial family? You\u2019re saying funny things. Didn\u2019t you say you were going to love me and marry me not too long ago? Wasn\u2019t that your real intention?\u201dEris, you\u2019ve got a lot of things going on don\u2019t you? My cheeks hurt, but suddenly I felt drained. Did Eris really love the Crown Prince?Later in the book, Helena denies that it is not love, but Helena did not know Eris. At least, that\u2019s what I thought. And I didn\u2019t know Eris either. Though I didn\u2019t know Eris, at least I wanted to be considerate of her feelings, if they were really so.\u201cI loved you. Not now.\u201dThe Crown Prince somehow looked embarrassed when I looked straight at him and said it, Somehow his face looked young. Well, everyone here was younger than me. I sighed and added, thinking that it was only myself that I had to fight.\u201c\u2026I mentioned the Imperial family because this is not my will either, but the marriage that my father and the Emperor are promoting. And if you want to get rid of it, don\u2019t be mad at me, ask, His Majesty. Now that I\u2019ve made this fuss, I think it has already reached His Majesty\u2019s ears.\u201dHis face hardened knowing that he will have to confront his scary father.I shook my head and went back and stood in front of the carriage, and the knight looked a little surprised when he saw my face. The knight hesitated a little and did not ask about the redness of my cheeks, but instead told me that something more tiring had happened.\u201cThere\u2019s Lord Kazar inside.\u201dI left one, and now had to confront another. I felt like I wanted to die under the carriage,Jason, who was trying to greet me at me, hardened his face. It seemed obvious that I was slapped by the prince. I thought he might want to kill me if I told him a joke that was uncomfortable or useless.\u201cNever mind. It had nothing to do with Lord Kazar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do as you please, lady.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what brings you to this carriage?\u201d,Jason comfortably leaned back and clapped one foot with his legs crossed. The carriage, which I thought was quite spacious, somehow became narrow,\u201cThe Duke of Kazar wants to ask the Marquis about the oath ceremony of the knight. I\u2019m the only errand boy in the house, so I got a carriage. Horses get sick and tired of adventures. I don\u2019t want to use them for a while.\u201d\u201cThe position of Lord Kazar should have been given the Imperial Household wagon.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no such beautiful lady in the royal carriage.\u201dIt was interesting to see him talking with a constant smile even though he looked like he had a piece of dung stuck under his nose. Is that how you ask for help from the villagers and flirt with women passing by? I asked, while avoiding the greasy gaze on me,\u201cAre you going on your next adventure?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wanted to, but since I killed the dragon, the mother of nature, I\u2019m going to hide myself in the capital for a while. Because there are dragons that hate me.\u201d\u201cI wanted\u2019? I originally asked him because I wanted him to disappear from my eyes, but an unexpected answer came back. It was described as just wanting to visit Helena and returning, but in fact, there was such an issue. This was quite interesting.Jason was born after receiving a prophecy from the High Priest that he would become a \u2018dragon killer\u2019. The Duke of Kazar\u2019s family tree always produced generals, and because of the prophecy, Jason was raised under harsh and severe training at an early age,The novel already started after Jason killed the dragon and returned, with Helena as a maid in the Imperial Palace. Since the book is about a love affair, it seems that he could not help it.It was the setting where Jason fell for Helena because she looked at Jason, instead of a person who was raised as a tool for killing the dragon\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s some time before we get to the Marquis, so tell me a little more about your story.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. You are unexpected. I thought you weren\u2019t interested.\u201dWith a slightly surprised look on his face, Jason quickly recovered and smiled again. I could see it slyly coated like slippery butter, so I replied more coldly.\u201cI\u2019m not interested. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t like Lord Kazar asking me questions. At least you won\u2019t ask me a question while you are talking.\u201d\u201cBe cold\u2026\u2026\u2026 All right. Whatever the intention, I can\u2019t refuse the lady\u2019s request.\u201d\u201cWhere should I start? As for the prophecy, there are rumors outside the Empire, so I don\u2019t have to tell you. I was trained to kill the dragon. I had to hold the sword as soon as I walked, and since then, could never take a day off\u2026\u201d,I used to resent my parents, but I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u2026 Now that I think about it, they did it to protect me. If it weren\u2019t for Helena, I wouldn\u2019t have realized it until it\u2019s too late and would have regrettedI knew I was going to be a dragon killer, but I didn\u2019t know when or how I was going to kill it. The family wanted to turn me into a knight, but I\u2026 I saw it differently.I felt threatened by the prophecy and feared that dragons might attack wherever I am. So I wandered around. I didn\u2019t know if there was a reason to be stronger.Now that I think about it, I think there was another reason. There was uncertainty and I might have given up. Maybe I thought I could die\u2026.But in my heart, I had to come back alive.I met a lot of friends while I was wandering. It was a good time. The best relationship among them was, by far, the dragon. Haha, you looked a bit surprised.\u2026\u2026 You thought she was a princess? No, where did the rumor stop\u2026 Hmmm, like a fairy tale, across swamps and mountains, across rivers and fields, the dragon was huge.I wondered if I would ever see such a big creature in my life again. I\u2019ll let you know that I found out later, as they say, the perception of size differs in proportion to the fear and pressure onehas.I realized it for the first time. I was actually scared. I wanted to run away because I wanted to live and I thought this whole situation was absurd.Why was I the only one training when other kids were running around? Actually, I wanted to stay at home, but why should I be the only one wandering around? Yes, it\u2019s funny, but I couldn\u2019t complain until I faced the dragon. Maybe it was because I thought it was really my last day. Even if you beat the dragon, you can\u2019t go back to normal.However, the dragon somehow spoke in a sad and calm voice,\u201cEven though it would have been a moment for you, the time I waited for you was too long.\u201cDid you know I was coming?\u2019I asked him without pointing the knife. The dragon said that it was not God that gave the revelation, but the dragon, for he manipulated the priest in order to die.The dragon was not allowed to die by natural causality, because he told me that he was the best product of nature and that it was possible because he paid enough for it. And then the dragon shut its mouth.What I saw wasn\u2019t a dragon, and the person afraid of dragons disappeared without a trace. Instead, I had to find and stab his heart,When I finally poked it\u2019s heart, the earth shook.And I got life.\u2026 It was a good story, but I didn\u2019t really sympathize with it. Well, there was no part to sympathize with, and no, I was not interested in Jason enough to sympathize with him.Rather, I paid attention to other parts. Instead of his stupid family history, I was worried about the fact that the dragon had to manipulate the priest in order to die. Not allowed to die by natural causality. That part too.Somehow, it seemed to be a clue. I was sorry for Jason, who was in a wistful mood, but I tapped him on the hand and asked.\u201cDo you happen to know who the manipulated priest was? And what do you mean by not being allowed to die by natural causality?\u201d,\u201cI heard that Priest Prometheus was old and passed away in his hometown\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know much about natural causality. The dragon only gave the answer, not explaining it to me. Well, I think you can understand it from the eyes of a trivial human being\u2026\u201dI thought he would be suspicious if I asked any more, so I roughly nodded. I wanted to find out more. One of the great things about the Empire was that it had a culture for good information agencies, and that it wasn\u2019t illegal.Jason, glancing at me, asked after thinking about it.\u201cYou\u2019re not talking informally to me\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re not in such a friendly relationship. Therefore, it\u2019s not a relationship that can be treated as such.\u201dWhen I deliberately said it colder on purpose in case a friend request came out again, he shut his mouth, with an expression resembling a scolded puppy. He wasn\u2019t even a real dog, so it didn\u2019t have the same effect.When I arrived at the mansion, Jason got off first and reached out to me. I didn\u2019t really want to hold it, but since the proper etiquette demanded it, I just tried to put my hands on top of his and get out. But Jason held my hand tightly\u201cDon\u2019t blame them too much. Being only in the Imperial Palace, even I\u2019m awkward because I\u2019ve never met my peers.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s past the age to be forgiven for being awkward.\u201dWith my arm bent inward, once again, Jason\u2019s affection fell with defending Helena and the Crown Prince.There aren\u2019t many people who can strike the Marquis\u2019 daughter, it was even more so when he said that to me, the victim, even though he knew who hit me in the face.Even if it was a small child, you\u2019d be scolded by your friend for not doing this, but instead you\u2019re protecting an adult to this extent.\u201cMy father will be in his study. Then I wish you all the best.\u201dAs if to shake off the hand I was holding, I bowed slightly with my legs. I said goodbye properly, so you should too?Fortunately, Jason was rather tactful. He bowed bitterly and bent his arms.\u201c\u2026\u2026Goodbye, Lady Mis\u00e9ran.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 06 Is Love That Important?I had to soothe the maid who was about to faint after seeing my face. I was given a bag of ice. Somehow, around the evening when the swelling had subsided, I ate alongside the Marquis.To be honest, it was a little awkward, so I was pushing food into my mouth to quickly finish as the Marquis talked. I wondered what I would do if he asked if something happened in the palace, but fortunately he didn\u2019t.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not going to choose a knight?\u201d\u201cI think our family knights are enough.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any particular reason to dislike it, go to the ceremony.\u201dThe Marquis paused and spoke in a calm voice.\u201c\u2026..Every year, small families or commoners become knights to seek for success, but are often not chosen due to their weaknesses. If I choose to choose anyway, it is to strengthen the union between the families by choosing the retainer of a powerful family.\u201d\u2018Is this because it creates a connection? I thought that modern society and the fantasy world; the places where people live are all the same.\u201cA knight of noble birth values only himself, and his mouth is light, so he cannot be entrusted with secrets. Although there are many cases in which the owner is serving a knight due to the disorganized relationship, that is not the duty of the knight.\u201dThe Marquis, who had touched the tip of the knife for a while, added with a sharp glance.\u201cYou send him to go to where you can\u2019t go, you let him do what you can\u2019t, one who won\u2019t tell anyone about it, so\u2026 if you find any nonsense, bring in someone to die foryou.\u201dEris is so good at decorating evil schemes, so Eris may need such a knight. Not me. But it\u2019s strange, as it couldn\u2019t be, but it seemed like the Marquis was telling me. Not to Eris, but to me.That\u2019s how it seemed. I don\u2019t know Eris. She has a ferocious heart, but I just vaguely mimicked \u2018the noble lady\u2019, not Eris. Minor habits, tastes, and preferences would have changed.People who had watched Eris all their lives couldn\u2019t help but recognize it. My hand holding the fork trembled.Should I apologize? I\u2019m sorry I stole your daughter\u2019s body? What if I apologize? Will you want to kick me out? Will he blame me?I was more afraid now than the time when I was caught by Hubris. Because it\u2019s a psychological debt. I feel guilty for taking away her beloved family.The Marquis looked at my hand and sighed. I closed my eyes tightly because I thought I was wrong,And he held my hand. When I looked up at him in surprise, he passed without saying a word. The blunt consideration brought tears to my eyes.I missed my dad.\u2018What happened to me? Is he dead? Is he alive? Would my parents be looking for me if I went missing?\u2019In my head, a picture of my parents who would distribute leaflets while looking for their daughter was drawn. Would my younger brother, who used to be immature, calm our parents as much during that time? Can I go back?It was scary.It is scary.I want to go home.Emma was a maidservant who had worked in this mansion since her birth. Emma\u2019s mother also worked for the Marquis, and if Emma had a daughter someday, she would work here too.She remembered the day when the girl, was first born. The white skin and red cheeks were so lovely that she thought all, babies were so pretty.When she gently touched her cheek for fear of breaking, her small hand tightly holding my finger was soft and warm and she shed a little tear. So Emma fell in love.The girl grew beautifully day by day. In this world, Helena, the maid of the Imperial Palace, is said to be the most beautiful, but Emma could be confident that the girl was saying such things to people who didn\u2019t know her.\u2018If Emma was looking at the dark blue hair planted after cutting the night sky, the skin shining like snow, the green eyes that resembled a forest in the middle of summer, and the bloody lips redder than a rose, she felt a desire to express her heart out.The girl was the only daughter of a noble family in the country, so her appearance was different. She always did her best, and she wanted the people around her to be the best. She even refused to meet her own standards, or even became angry.In the streets, she said she was arrogant and proud, and Emma hated the people who said that.\u2018What are the complaints that the most precious lady in the country deserves?She said that her fianc\u00e9 was the prince, and she was the body that would one day become the empress. Her future will always be high up anyway, and people were jealous of it and always tried to trash her lady.The more they did, the more she tried. She thoroughly fostered herself to prevent another disgrace. She studied when she was teased for being stupid, and she put a lot of effort into her appearance so that she wouldn\u2019t be told that she has become uglier than before.When she heard the harsh words, she paid ten times as much as she did when he touched her things, twenty times as much as he did.She didn\u2019t have to be pretty to those who didn\u2019t like her. Rather, she acted more vicious than the rumors. Emma, who was sad that a beautiful baby was hated, asked why, and the girl replied with a strange face.\u2013 I have to be mean, so you guys won\u2019t be ignored.\u2013 But unlike you, we\u2019re from a humble background.\u2013 Foolishness, men of high posts are insidious, and they make fun of me by putting me on top of you as lowly people. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, and the owner (father) knows. Because I can\u2019t see it, make sure you guys hold your heads high.As soon as the palace recognized her as a woman of marriageable age, they sent people to teach her royal court manners and practical affairs of the palace,At that time, her young lady could hardly sleep. Oftentimes, she used to run out of energy, but she never skipped visiting the Imperial Palace. She continued to go and return, still dazzlingly dressed but with a pale face.There was a rumor that the Crown Prince hated her, but there was no way to express it.Emma could not console. She watched as it hurt the young lady\u2019s high self-esteem. Emma was anxious about the girl. Her young lady was melting away.\u2018It was a sunny day. After the long winter, the weather finally cleared up, and the servants were all busy tidying up their closets.Emma was also carrying a blanket in her arms and totteringly, unsteadily, moving her feet. It was then. What she saw in the far corner.The young lady didn\u2019t cry. Even though she was criticized by everyone for being a tough woman, she never shed a tear in front of people.So was that day. The young lady was just sitting. She wasn\u2019t crying, she didn\u2019t even look at the forest.Emma was suddenly struck with fear.\u2013 My lady.Eris did not answer.\u2013 My lady, the floor is still cold.Eris didn\u2019t get up.\u2013 My lady, my lady, please say something\u2026!Eris did not cry. Emma ran to her and wrapped the blanket around her as if she was hiding the young lady. Finally shielded from everything, Eris asked.\u2013 Is love that important?\u2013 Pardon?\u2013 But it\u2019s a position that you can\u2019t just sit in with just love. That\u2019s not a good thing. Can you be an empress if you just love the Emperor and smile? The empress, the empress\u2026 She\u2019s a person who assists the Emperor, and I learned that way, and I worked hard.They don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her sincerity is not seen. Her determination is treated as self-righteousness, and she is considered arrogant when she is motivated.Because she\u2019s not nice, because she\u2019s not sweet, because a villainess is disgusting.\u2013 I like it even if you (the Crown Prince) don\u2019t love me. But I can admit it. Huh? \u2026She can only laugh, but everyone loves her\u2026\u2026Finally, the blanket got wet. Oh, Emma wished how good it would have been if she had been a witch. If only she could hide Eris\u2019 tears right now because they were raining down.But Emma was just an ordinary and ugly maidservant, so all she could do was pray. May all of Eris\u2019 wishes come true.However, Eris wished that she would be able to disappear at that time.Miracles work in the most unfortunate way.Emma was a maid who worked in this mansion from the time she was born. She could actually say that she had watched Eris longer than Eris\u2019 parents, and she was confident. So Emma was so sure that her lady had suddenly changed.She didn\u2019t tap her fourth finger lightly when she\u2019s contemplating something anymore. Her habit of drinking a glass of water before she went to bed, and the habit of chewing the tips of her fingernails when she was nervous.Instead, she began to cross her legs lightly one day and found spicy spices that she had not eaten.Emma thought she knew better than anyone else, but the lady kept feeling unfamiliar. Changed speech, changed steps, changed habits\u2026\u2026 Emma was sometimes caught up by the urge to grab and shake her lady.Who?She will be kicked out as a crazy woman, but she wanted to ask. She wanted to shout in her heart, \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d, and, \u201cWhere did my lady go?\u201d\u2018It was a simple thing to say that she hadsimply lost her memory, but yet she remembered all the really important facts.What\u2019s really driving Emma crazy was that the young lady was trying her best to \u201dpretend to be fine\u2019.So Emma was even more suspicious. What if the young lady was taken away by a bad witch? If you ask for help, you will be executed as a witch. The helpless Emma won\u2019t be able to save her.But one night, Emma decided to ask questions she wanted to throw up again and again everyday.When she suddenly woke up thirsty, Emma unconsciously sneaked open the door of the young lady. This is because she sometimes checked it, to cover the fire well again if the lady kicks it.But instead of her sleeping young lady, what greeted Emma was a crumpled blanket that had lost her master. Emma\u2019s heart hurt.\u2018Nowadays, there are many unusual accidents. There were times when the lady was stabbed by an eccentric, and there were times when the stall keeper managed to get his foot on the wrong spot on the roof.What if it wasn\u2019t an accident? What if someone was executing a clever plan to hurt Eris?No, no, no. Emma barely picked up a candle and ran barefoot. Emma couldn\u2019t call Eris because her voice broke. It was a big deal if the kidnapper noticed and ran away or hurt Eris, so Emma ran regardless of the cut of her foot.Please don\u2019t go too far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 07 Hold You BackWhen she finally found Eris in her pajamas, walking far away, Emma thought her heart was about to burst, out of breath. She quickly moved her legs, creating a squeaky sound, to snatch Eris.Eris was crying, out of focus.\u2013 I want to go home.\u2013 Your house is here.\u2013 I want to go home\u2026 Mom, Mom\u2026\u2013 My lady, your mother, your mother\u2026\u2013 Mom, I want to eat kimchi fried rice.Only then did Emma realize. That her lady will never come back.What was in front of her was not the faithful, arrogant and lovable Eris. The poor child was lost, suffering as she wandered around without waking up from her dream. Emma was sorry for admitting what she realized so late.As the child began to tear herself apart, Emma hugged her whole body and whispered.\u2018It\u2019s okay, it\u2019ll be okay.She didn\u2019t let go of the child\u2019s arm and head even if she hurt her. I\u2019ll be by your side. Until the night burns white again and again\u2026 She whispered to her again and again and again.You know, lady. Actually, I wanted to ask you something.In this world, was there nothing that could hold you back?I didn\u2019t want to do anything, but the novel wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. The maids washed and decorated me constantly, as if even mold would grow if I was still.When I said I didn\u2019t want to eat anything, the maid grabbed the spoon and fork and tried to feed me, saying I would only have to open my mouth. I was treated as a three-year-old, so I had no choice but to eat a little bit of food.In the last few days, the maids were nervous that I would collapse straight away. It was also funny to hope that the rumors would not spread as the Imperial \u2018Palace would make a fuss.Perhaps by now, the social circle might be throwing a party for me being slapped by the Crown Prince. They were not against Eris because they were afraid of her, but no one in the community who really liked Eris and took care of her.In the novel\u2019s description, Eris was completely self-conscious, so if I were the real Eris, I would have made a disturbance by now.Since I am not, the people in this family were rather worried about why Eris was sitting still. They even took my temperature to see if I was sick.To be honest, I was a little angry that I was slapped, so I wanted to break into the Imperial Palace. I wanted to kill him by using a club when the prince was sleeping, but I repeatedly remembered that the Marquis held my hand.It\u2019s because my own dad\u2019s hand is similar in size. I\u2019ve never held my dad\u2019s hand more than a few times in my life. Maybe that\u2019s why. If I had known this, I would have held my dad\u2019s hand a lot.I thought of my family whenever I was absent-minded. People said they start to regret only after losing it. It was just like that. My family and I weren\u2019t on bad terms, but it wasn\u2019t that good either. No, to be exact, I drew to the corner of the house.At that time, I didn\u2019t like the expectations my parents had on me. If I had hoped for it, I would have been interested in it, but it was unfair. I was always left on my own to do well, but if I couldn\u2019t do it, they scolded me. Even if it was a joke, they never did it to my brother who is three years younger.I wanted to go to music school. I think I had the talent. I got good grades as well. The only thing I didn\u2019t have was money, but that passion was the most important. Instead of the university I wanted to go to, I put in an application at another university, where the tuition was cheap. But because I didn\u2019t have higher grades, I couldn\u2019t get into the course I wanted.Still, in order to get a scholarship, I studied really hard. When I needed pocket money, I got a short-term part-time job. I was told that we had no money every day, so || thought this is what I had to do.When it came to my brother, he had to retake his college exam.The reason was that it couldn\u2019t be helped. When he failed to go to the department he wanted to go to, my parents paid all the tuition fees for my younger brother, as well as the cost of his cram school.Thated such parents. They are much more generous to my brother than to me, and they seem to love him more.I got a job with all my might, and I became independent early. I reluctantly called to say hello during the holidays, but I never went down. I purposely sent birthday presents in cash. But since they raised me, I felt like I should do that much.I thought we could meet again whenever I wanted. Maybe that\u2019s why I acted colder. I knew my parents would wait for me.If I knew I\u2019d never see them again, I should have gone down there pretending | couldn\u2019t win when I got a text message saying I can do what I liked.\u2018If I knew this would happen, I shouldn\u2019t have said nothing when they asked what I wanted for my birthday. I always thought I wouldn\u2019t get it, but when I think about it, didn\u2019t do anything for them.Acting cute has always been my brother\u2019s responsibility, and I helped him with the common massage and housework. When they ate chicken, they said they were feeding chicken legs to my younger brother and me, so they ate other parts first.It may be natural to like my younger brother more. If we meet again, I\u2019d be more considerate. My throat was choked with belated remorse.I was so sorry I couldn\u2019t go home, but in the midst of this, the Imperial Palace finished sewing the clothes to match with the prince, so they told me to come to try them on.The knight oath ceremony was one of the big events in the novel anyway, so it was natural to call me, who is the prince\u2019s fiancee.Tunderstand this in my head, but it\u2019s not that it\u2019s not my heart. There was a Crown Prince in the palace. The Crown Prince who slapped me in the face, who didn\u2019t get punished, and could flirt with Helena without guilt.Even if we meet at the oath ceremony, we won\u2019t be able to control our facial expressions. Just the two of us? When | came to my senses, it was fortunate that there was no Crown Prince in front of me.I dressed myself as if I was going to a slaughterhouse and loaded myself into a carriage. It\u2019s going to happen anyway, so I decided to get there first.Somehow I managed the strength to look out the window, and noticed that the people on the side of the road were all laughing.Except me. Everyone looked so happy except me.Why should I be the one to get hit? It flashed across my mind. Why do I have to put up with it? What am I doing so wrong that I have to stand next to the guy who slapped me and smile?\u201cStop the carriage.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that? Pull over the carriage now!\u201dThe carriage came to a sudden stop. As soon as it stopped, the knight ran outside without a hitch. My shoes were a little high, but they were fine. I wore this a lot in Korea, too.I jumped into the narrowest and deepest alley to keep the knights out. I felt like throwing up because I was out of breath, but I kept laughing.Should I hide like this forever? If I ran away from this life, would they not give up on me someday? Then, if the world gives up on me, wouldn\u2019t I be able to go back? My eyes heated up.Let it go. Give it up. Helena is the only thing the world needs anyway.\u201cThere she is! Get the young miss!The knights\u2019 cries made me impatient. I even threw off my shoes and walked up and down the stairs barefooted.I don\u2019t want to get caught. If I got caught, I would be dragged into the palace. No, even if I don\u2019t go to the palace right now, I\u2019ll be taken home and pushed into the palace tomorrow. The mere thought of it made me feel sick.I was urgently looking for a place to hide \u2018myself, someone grabbed my hand. I thought it was a ghost and was ready to scream, but I swallowed it.The scruffy-looking boy in front of me covered her lips with her fingers and asked me.\u201cDo you want to run away?\u201d\u201cHaa, haa\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cGoodness, do you want to hide?\u201dAs I nodded blankly, the child laughed and whistled. Then other children popped out of the alley. They dispersed in unison while I was being led by hand.Some of them paired up and played with rubber bands, and some of them played hide-and-seek deliberately. While they were blocking the road and drawing attention, I was pushed into a house. The door closed, and the child grinned and reached out.\u201cMy compensation. You saw al-I those kids that jumped out, right? And you better not try to call it even by just getting me some snacks, alright?\u201d\u201cWhat, that\u2026\u201dI was embarrassed and touched my waist for a moment, because of my full dress, it didn\u2019t have a pocket.I felt sorry for the child\u2019s growing disappointment, so I took out the jewelry from my ears and gave them to her. Then she gave me a big smile.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you will be tracked down and accused as a thief. Use it well.\u201d\u201cNo worries, miss. This is our specialty!\u201dWhen I heard a rattling sound from the back of the door, the child quickly said \u201chere, here!\u201d and pushed me into a closet.The family\u2019s knight came to search the house, so she paused and hid herself. But the man who came in was not a knight of the family.As if he knew the child, he welcomed her with a smiling face. Blurred with brown hair and brown eyes\u2026. In this novel, which is full of sparkling faces, he was a man with a typical \u2018extra\u2019s\u2019 appearance.Looking at the floor without responding to the child\u2019s small talk, he suddenly asked the child.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWho did you bring home?\u201d\u201cWho do you think I will bring here? Oh, my God, this dusty house\u2026\u201dSighing at the deft liar, the man walked straight into the closet where I was hiding. Teven took my eyes away from the crack, covered my mouth with my hands and held, my breath, but the man did not hesitate.\u201cCome out.\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201dThe man opened the closet door and looked down at me. The calm eyes were filled with tiredness, rather than contempt or pity. I didn\u2019t want to squabble with a weary man, so I kicked my tongue and exited the closet.When I came out, the man reached out to the child. When the child blinked, feigning ignorance, he raised his eyebrows.The child groaned and put the earrings she had received into the man\u2019s hand. The man placed it back in my hand.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cI saved her and received it!\u201d\u201cQuiet. You know there\u2019s nothing good about being involved with aristocrats.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dI looked at a man who was soothing the child, who raised his voice as if he was being falsely accused, and threw my earrings at him again.The man who reflexively caught the earrings looked at me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She saved me and I gave them to her.\u201d\u201cSee? I\u2019m right?!\u201d\u201cStill.\u201d\u201cI will be in trouble if she doesn\u2019t accept them. The earrings include the payment of silence.\u201dI thought it would take another year at this rate, so I stopped talking to the man after saying that. Whatever the man\u2019s expression, it seems something just occurred to him.Still, I thought of saving the trouble of trying to connect to an information guild to find the priest Metheus.\u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, but even if you find out later, please keep quiet. And\u2026 I want to find a reliable information guild.\u201d\u201cShe knows!\u201d\u201cKeep quiet!\u201dThe child raised her hand and tried to reply. But the man grabbed the child\u2019s hand quickly, pulled her away, looked straight at me and took a breath.There was a hint of uncertainty.There was nothing good about commoners hanging out with aristocrats. Even if you take advantage of it, you must keep being secretive and you can\u2019t say anything.\u201cHa, Lady\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you know my family, you\u2019ll have no choice but to comply with my request.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just call you lady. Lady, I\u2019m sorry to bother you with a child who doesn\u2019t know anything, but we can\u2019t afford to bring you anything you want. Please excuse us for being poor and incompetent, and leave this house.\u201dThen the man bowed his head exaggeratedly. It was truly a polite and smart gesture. Unfortunately, for him, I liked it more. It was better to be polite rather than cheeky, and to be wise instead of stupid.The effort not to get entangled in any way was hypothetical, but I was more desperate. I sat down on the nearby bed and crossed my legs.\u201cIf I go out now, my family will think you kidnapped me. Then, all those little children will be dragged and questioned. Do you really want that?\u201d\u201cInstead, you both need to listen to my request. Then, I can create the opposite scenario. I almost had a rough time, but you guys saved me. What will you do?\u201dThe child jabbed the man in his sides. What was he hesitating about? The man nodded as he brushed away his troubled face.In fact, such a threat was my only option, so I didn\u2019t feel guilty. You shouldn\u2019t have dragged me in like that. I looked straight at the child and said,\u201cI need a very reticent, highly capable information guild. But most importantly, they need to guarantee that information doesn\u2019t leak out, so please keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cNancy\u2019s father in the back alley is doing an information service, and he\u2019s a very sincere and trustworthy person.\u201d\u201cAll right. Tell him to find out where the Metheus Shrine is.\u201d\u201cHow much is the commission?\u201d\u201cHoh, are you so confident in your skills, that it\u2019s enough to receive an advance payment? If you don\u2019t find it, it\u2019s going to be hard.\u201dThe child nodded as if she was convinced. Tasked the man standing, who was staring at me all this time.\u201cYou look unhappy.\u201d\u201cDid you come here on purpose?\u201dThe fresh misperception was cute.Although my clothes were a little wrinkled due to hiding, everything I had on my body was expensive enough to buy the whole neighborhood.Even if it was a trap, I would not have come all the way here to harm them, who had nothing. I\u2019d just have a knight in the family carry out the bullying in my stead.\u201cNo way. Do you think I have a lot of time to come and visit people who don\u2019t even know who I am? I was being chased.\u201d\u201cNobles do not go about ordering the first person they meet today to find something through the information guild. They might reveal secrets to others.\u201dAha, so you are suspicious. I rose up, getting slightly on my tiptoes, turned my head and pushed my face close to theman.Eris thought the man would be affected, it wasn\u2019t empty words that she was the second prettiest in the Empire. But surprisingly, he just lowered his eyes and looked at me.\u201cIf I wanted to, if I set my mind to it, I could kill you in half a day.\u201d\u201cEven if a gutter rat threatens to bite, will humans be afraid? Instead, just kill the rat and stop talking about everything the rat said.\u201dIn modern society, it is common for powerful people to prey on the weak in such a way. In a society where the caste system openly exists, doing such could not be a big challenge or become a flaw. That\u2019s probably why the man desperately tried to separate the child from me.It was only after hearing me that the child was frightened and trembling. Well, I didn\u2019t mean to threaten them unless they really spoke out. So I deliberately put secrecy before skill\u2026 I smiled and patted the child on the head.\u201cYou\u2026 you don\u2019t even see us as human lives.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m a little different from the average aristocrat.\u201dThe man\u2019s shoulders shook, as if he were angry. I was not interested in how other nobles looked at the common people. I just remembered that it was not a good treatment in the novel.But the reason why I can be so cruel is not because I have a high status while they have a low status. Unfortunately, for me they weren\u2019t really people.No one agrees with virtual characters who do not exist unless they themselves are immersed in it.Even if a character, who is as good as the background in the game, dies, instead of crying in regret, they just accept it with a text describing dead\u2019.Immersion requires a convincing narrative, which in turn creates affection. One hopes a character they love doesn\u2019t die. Unfortunately, there was no such character that made me feel this way in this novel with a cliche narrative.Everything I love, everything I cared about\u2026 existed in my original world, not here. My family, my friends, my favorite songs and the scenery I loved\u2026I was prepared to die to get all that back. I looked back at the man and whispered, putting aside his ideas.\u201c\u2026\u2026Now take me there.\u201dThe man looked at me in bewilderment and soon took off his shoes. He got down on his knees and put onto my feet the shoes that he took off. Even if it was loose because it was not the right size, it would not come off because it had a long neck.Judging from the situation of the house | entered, I don\u2019t know what to do because I don\u2019t think there are any shoes left. Even with the down payment I gave you, the stores would be closed because it\u2019s time\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have any shoes left, why did you give me your shoes?\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t let the lady walk barefoot.\u201dThe man replied as he opened the door and waited silently for me to come out.\u2026\u2026I honestly don\u2019t want to go out. If cross through that door, the story will go on again. I couldn\u2019t even guess how much more obvious a future I would have to endure. It was short to read, but it was said a long time had passed in the novel.I still wanted to run away. But if I really want to run away, I shouldn\u2019t have rushed out like this. They are the most powerful people in the country, so if I don\u2019t plan carefully, they will find me somehow. If | hide in this house, I\u2019ll be discovered before 2am in the morning.In addition, it felt funny that I, who am prepared to die, was afraid of the Crown Prince because he slapped me once, or that I was worried about the future that might not happen.\u2018If you posted this concern on communities or broadcast programs, of course, there might be a lot of comments asking why you are so frustrated when you have to hold a man.Suddenly, I felt much more at ease. Yeah, why would I avoid it? I\u2019ll kill the Crown Prince.I was a little curious about what would happen if I, which the world keeps alive because of the causality, kills the male protagonist.When I got home in good shape, people couldn\u2019t even scold me and just stared blankly. I smiled nonchalantly because one couldn\u2019t curse on a smiling face.\u201cI was so frustrated that I wanted to get some air alone.\u201d\u201cBut miss, you got rid of your escort.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I come back safely? I\u2019m tired. I want to rest.\u201dAs I cut the conversation, the head maid instructed the younger maid to get water for me to wash, as if it couldn\u2019t be helped.While she was attending a bath, I thought | had to meet Hubris as soon as possible.It was a bit embarrassing to admit that I am not a person of this world after doing so, but I thought that it was because there were so many people. No way the benevolent high priest will pretend to be unaware of a lamb in trouble.In fact, I should have tried on my clothes yesterday. That way, it would have been possible to properly attend the knight\u2019s oath ceremony, but I turned my eyes and ran away.Since the palace is also a place where Hubris appears at, I decided not to run away and quietly go today.Still, the people of the Marquis family were not reassured, and thus more people than usual escorted the carriage. Even if Eris ran away, she would not escape for more than ten steps as they would be so strict that she would be caught.As soon as I arrived at the Imperial Palace, I needed to say hello to the Emperor, but today the Emperor said that he needed to go out for an inspection.The Crown Prince said that he was working on behalf of the Emperor after having finished his fitting yesterday, so I thought it was good that I ran out yesterday anyways.The purple cloth, one of the colors that symbolizes the Imperial Family, fluttered. Because it was a hot day, my shoulders and back were open, but perhaps because of the neatness, it was an elegant dress with a collar that came up to the neck but off the shoulders.\u2018It was a smooth and sticky fabric, but it somehow looked elegant. I thought it would be inconvenient to wash because the tail is long and drags on.\u201cOh, my\u2026 you will be such a beautiful fianc\u00e9, and everyone will be envious ofyou.\u201d\u201d\u00bb\u201cAre there any places that are ill-fitting?\u201dI didn\u2019t really want to answer her, so I kept my mouth shut and the quick-witted maid hurried back. When I roughly shook my head, she examined me carefully then undressed me again.When I looked at the maid after having changed out of everything I had worn, she smiled softly, saying that I wouldn\u2019t worry because she would send my dress to the mansion within the day.I was crossing the back garden to go back, and after I got used to it, I saw his head.\u2018It\u2019s Hubris! I thought I shouldn\u2019t miss this opportunity, so I ran recklessly,It wasn\u2019t as long as the dress I wore earlier, but it was still cumbersome because it was not short. I tried to grab him somehow while running, but I tripped and fell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only then did Hubris look back. If it was Helena signing, he would immediately notice. I was a little irritated to realize I had to scream for him to take notice. Hubris\u2019 approach became a little faster, then he knelt down and asked.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cDo I look all right?!\u201dI\u2019m dying from pain, but he is asking the obvious. When I snapped back, he hurriedly reached out with a perplexed face.\u201cI\u2019m touching your ankle\u2026 Please forgive my rudeness.\u201dHubris used divine power. The white light came out of his palms, and soon, gradually, the pain in my ankle died down.I was staring at him because it was a strange sight, but it ended quickly. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s a small injury. Greetings then were given to Hubris, who was about to leave.\u201cYou\u2019ve met me before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cYou asked me who I am.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u2018Hubris looked uncomfortable, but somehow he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off me. The focus in his eyes was clouded. Not because I was beautiful, but because he saw something beyond. I looked around and whispered to Hubris.\u201cWho do I look like?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t see the image of the soul.\u201dHubris sighed and looked straight at me and said.\u201cI see the color of the soul. And there is not a single person in the world who has a color like yours. I thought it was an illusion, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Back then, there were a lot of people\u2019s eyes on us and I was distracted, so I didn\u2019t know what to do. Now, as you see, I came from a different world. Can I go back to where I used to live?\u201dWith a faint hope, I desperately asked him. Hubris hesitated, repeatedly opening and shutting his mouth again and again.Hey, do you know or do you not know. Is there a way, or there\u2019s no way. Tell me quickly! There was nothing good about seeing the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e having a long talk with another man as she exited the palace. I was so frustrated that I tightly gritted my teeth and asked again.\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t give you a definite answer. But as far as I know\u2026\u201dI was stunned by his words, \u2018There is not a single foreigner who has gone out alive\u2019. I thought it was okay to die, but I guess it wasn\u2019t. I kept laughing in vain.\u201cNo? There must be some way. A door to another dimension\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy lady.\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t have a way out alive, how could I come into this world alive? Right? There\u2019s a way, but you don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease find it. Since you are a high priest, if you go back to the temple, won\u2019t you be able to find historical records? That\u2019s why-\u201d\u201cLady! Listen to me.\u201dHubris grabbed me, who was talking gibberish and shouted. I was a little short of breath. Hubris explained to me slowly and clearly, one word at a time as if I was a child.\u201cThe lady\u2026. If the lady (original Eris) was born into this world, the original soul inside the lady\u2019s body has disappeared now. That\u2019s why you could come safely into this world. That\u2019s the law of life. In other words, in order for the lady to die safely, it is possible only when the soul of the lady\u2019s in the original world dies, precisely the soul of the lady\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cThen \u2026\u201d\u201cBut the original lady isn\u2019t here. That lady\u2019s body probably had an empty shell without a soul. Since, there is no soul to die, there is no way to go back alive. Accept fate and live her life instead.\u201d(T/N: few readers might have gotten confused let me explain in simple terms: the OG Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s soul has disappeared completely, that\u2019s why she(MC) was able to enter into this body safely, in order for MC to return to her \u2018OG world\u2019 she needs to kill the soul that is residing in her previous body, but the MC is here now which means her body has become an empty shell=dead)He finished his speech calmly and slowly raised me up. I was rather irritated by his endlessly benevolent expression.His job allowed him to spit it out so easily. How to accept? If I were to accept, it was better to learn magic, make friends with a witch, and have an adventure rather than the status of the Crown Prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.My stomach, which I had tried to stab myself to death, felt ill. How many more times do I have to stab myself to finish it? No, I don\u2019t know if I can even tie it up. I think I\u2019ll be cut off before then.The painful thoughts started to eat me. Before despair swallowed me, I barely opened my mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the law of life, I\u2019ll die and go out.\u201dAs I jumped up and tried to hurry to the witch, the surprised voice of Hubris caught me.\u201cLady! You must cherish the life God gave you!\u201d\u201cGod-given life?\u201dI was dumbfounded, so I looked around. I was originally an atheist in my world, but I had to hear such a thing even in novels.\u201cMy life was given to me by my parents, not by God. If you weren\u2019t conceived by the Holy Spirit, then it would be the same for you.\u201dBe filial to your parents, mister. Do you understand? This sentence was about to rise from my throat, but I decided to hold it in because there could be no Confucian thoughts in the world.To be honest, it\u2019s a speechless remark, even if it does sound like heresy. But you can\u2019t accuse me, a person from another world, of being an apostate. At least, that\u2019s what I know of Hubris.I was tired of being a living human mannequin who couldn\u2019t buy clothes without their own mother.I really couldn\u2019t think of anything and I felt as if I was broken, so it was time to take a heavy step and go lie down on the bed.Helena was walking across from me when she saw me. I was nervous about showing everything, so I tried to run away, pretending not to notice and just kept walking.Then, she grabbed my hand just as I was about to pass. When I looked at her in a daze, she took a deep breath, looked me in the eye and said,\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, I want to ask for forgiveness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cHis Highness\u2026 about hitting Lady Mis\u00e9rian in the face.\u201dA sigh came out of my mouth. The person who hit is another, but I don\u2019t know why Helena should apologize. But I felt much better because she didn\u2019t speak informally like last time.\u201cDid Lady Antebellum slap me in the face? No, you did not. You don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d\u201cStill, but still\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel guilty. Then I\u2019ll leave you\u2026\u201dI was going to say good-bye roughly, but Helena didn\u2019t let go. Her hands were warm and soft.\u201cNo, I\u2019ll keep apologizing. It\u2019s okay if Lady Mis\u00e9rian doesn\u2019t forgive me. Even if I didn\u2019t hit Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s cheek myself, I\u2019m guilty of helping His Highness\u2019s slap.\u201dHelena\u2019s hands tightened. Her eyes got wet, but she didn\u2019t cry. Even though her voice trembled, her bright purple eyes did not shake. She\u2019s asserting herself.\u201cI should have kept his Highness from touching Lady Mis\u00e9rian that day. And I should have reported that the maid who was following me had misunderstood. But | just watched until Lady Mis\u00e9rian left. Obviously it\u2019s my fault. Sorry. Sorry. Please forgive me.\u201dYou are upright and lovely. Your kindness makes me cry. If I were a villain who only pretended to be good, I would have hated you with ease.Then I suddenly saw Helena\u2019s hands. Her hands were flawless, soft and clean.As far as I know, her status was a maid of \u2018honor. It would be more like a low-ranking maid who usually does chores, not a senior maid who came from a noble family to serve.Come to think of it, Helena grew up in a difficult environment and was too busy in her role of healing the hearts of the men and making them fall in love. Everyone loves Helena.The good girl had an obligation to \u2018give an impartial answer to all of them. There is no time to wash the dishes, do the laundry, or clean. The Crown Prince and Empress must be busy calling her in to chat.When I read it, I skipped it without thinking, but after facing it, I felt strange. No, let\u2019s be honest. I felt bad.\u201cHow can you be so clean and pretty?\u201d\u201c\u2026My lady?\u201dHelena resembled my old friend who was in college. She was the only child. Her pretty and kind personality made her popular with everyone, and was strangely fond of me. You\u2019re honest, you\u2019re funny. That was the reason.I liked her, too. No one can dislike someone who approaches with kindness.Considering my situation, my friend, sometimes paid for my meal without saying a word, and even if I couldn\u2019t attend the lecture, on my behalf, she told me about the progress of the class.Most of all, she didn\u2019t have any intention or shallow sympathy. She would have helped me the same way, even if I had more money than her, because she understood my poverty because she didn\u2019t like the poor me\u2019, but because she liked \u2018me\u2019. But the reason why I couldn\u2019t really get along with her\u2026\u2013 Don\u2019t your parents help you that much?\u2013 No, I\u2019m not the only one in my house, and I\u2019m not the only one\u2026\u2013 But you\u2019re still a daughter, so\u2026 talk to them.It is ironic because of her innocence. The only difficulty she had in her life was to study for a while for Gon University. No, in fact, since she received expensive tutoring at home, her starting line was ahead of others. She used to say it with a smile, though she said \u2018it was hard enough todie\u2019.She was nice to me, but she didn\u2019t know the difficulties. And I didn\u2019t even know it was a privilege not to know the difficulties. No, maybe she could be so pure because she didn\u2019t know the difficulty. I think.\u2026. The same is true of Helena\u2019s innocence. \u2018If Helena had been less beautiful, if she hadn\u2019t been close to the Crown Prince, could she have been so naive if she had been doing something as bad as a commoner?Your uprightness, for it has never been broken. Because everyone loves you and protects you.\u201cI\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t like people like you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 10 Inferiority Complex\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u201dSomeone may be doing what Helena had put off (work) on her way to see the Crown Prince every day. That\u2019s why Helena was able to have such pretty hands, and I couldn\u2019t stand it.No, no\u2026 Let\u2019s be more honest. I hated the feeling of inferiority after finding motivation I thought it was worth living, but when I met her, I kept blaming myself and the surrounding environment.Would it have been different if I had been a girl from a rich family, this is a question that has always crushed my heart. I knew it for sure only after I came to this world, and became an enviable aristocrat, Eris. It\u2019s just that my personality isn\u2019t pure.But what about my bad personality? There is also a prince who lives by beating others, so it\u2019s not so bad that I hate him inside. My feelings are completely mine.\u201cSo there is no need to apologize to me. I will not like you in the future.\u201dSo it\u2019s okay if you feel comfortable hating me, Helena. Even you, who lived without hating others even once.I was tired because I had been getting dressed up since dawn. Even when I lived in Korea, I didn\u2019t wear makeup unless it was to go to someone else\u2019s wedding, but after I became Eris, I was told to wear \u2018makeup whenever I tried to go out.She\u2019s better off without all the makeup and erasing it, but\u2026 I\u2019II convince them not to even do it in the middle of summer. Eris is skinny even without a corset, so let\u2019s stop doing this today.Wearing a purple dress sent by the Imperial Family, I went outside with a bunch of shiny jewels.Tusually ride a family carriage, but today is the day, so they sent a carriage from the Imperial Palace. The carriage flashed with dazzling white marble and gold. Ha, I got tired and sighed.The Marquis told me to hire a knight, but this body decided to die anyway. I didn\u2019t want to ruin someone else\u2019s life for not protecting me, being hired for nothing.\u2018It was supposed to be an eye candy to hang on to such beautiful ladies and return quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling morning, Your Highness.\u201dWhen I got off the carriage, the prince with a weary expression was waiting for me. The Crown Prince I knew would not have come out, so it must have been the Emperor\u2019s influence.Theard a gasping sound from around me. Because of the elaborate decorations, today\u2019s Eris was beautiful enough to make her eyes cold, so it was understandable.However, it seems that it wasn\u2019t effective on the prince, who lives every day seeing the face of Helena, the most beautiful woman in the novel. There is no compliment, even as empty words,I didn\u2019t even want to give my hand, but I forced my finger out, so the prince tilted his head groaning with his eyes, asking what this was. Originally, if you\u2019re handsome, all is forgiven. Even though the Prince looks better than any other actor I\u2019ve seen, I feel bad because I don\u2019t likehim.Do you know how to raise your eyebrows? I know how to do it. As I did the same thing and looked at him, he grabbed my hand and walked along. My hands were wriggling with chills, but he held me with a lot of strength.Don\u2019t be dragged away in a stupefying way, stop your feet. The Crown Prince looked back at me in annoyance as I held back, with my feet tight.There was a war of nerves without words.No matter how much I hate it, when the Crown Prince leaned down and lifted me with a princess carry at the same moment when he shouted, \u201cWhat kind of attitude is this?\u201d, whistles spread along with cheers. Are they really crazy?\u201cWhat kind of disrespect is this?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to be hugged by me?\u201dI really wanted to rip off all that great hair. Sol naturally raised my nails while pretending to wrap my arms around his neck.I should have asked the maid to sharpen my nails when she was cleaning them up. \u2018If the Crown Prince speaks nonsense, I\u2019ll scratch him. I clenched my teeth and whispered.\u201cNot at all, so won\u2019t you put me down? If I struggle, it would be ugly.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to be married to the Imperial Family anyway, so let\u2019s go. I don\u2019t know what you asked His Majesty to do, but he even ordered me to take good care of you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying it as if it was my fault?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it. When I see him responding sensitively.\u201d\u201cHow do you blame me for not being trusted?\u201dI thought he had been broken by his father, so I tried to endure it, but he blamed me again. The little girl who had never left as much as her fingerprint disappeared.I looked around and stabbed the prince with my fingernails. With the unexpected surprise attack, the Crown Prince released his strength from the hand that was holding me up. I came down in a hurry and fell to my knees.\u201cYour Majesty, if you have a hard time, please let me know right away. How can you overdo it! Oh, no! Would you forgive this young lady for being foolish and not noticing your difficulties earlier?\u201dThe knights\u2019 eyes fell on the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince\u2019s face quickly turned red after being treated and seen as a weakling by his fianc\u00e9e. I cried out again before he could open his mouth.\u201cWhere is your servant! Why didn\u2019t you bring the parasol? If His Highness falls on this important day, will you be responsible?\u201dThe attendant, who was contemplating my hysterics, ran back with a parasol the size of his body. I pretended to support the prince, but I pressed his body tightly and folded my arms.As I changed my stance like flipping the palm of my hand, the prince stared at me with an extremely angry face, like I was a crazy person. Of course it wasn\u2019t my business.Thad to pay him back two or three times so I had just decided to go all out. I parted my lips a little, as if I were ventriloquizing with a smiling face, and spoke with force.\u201cSmile. Didn\u2019t you say His Majesty told you to take good care of me?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is asking if you\u2019re coming or not, you\u2019re really crossing the line, young lady.\u201d\u201cThen please listen again, Your Highness.\u201dI took out a handkerchief and pretended to wipe the Crown Prince\u2019s sweat. I didn\u2019t forget to smile with my eyes.\u201cYou should break up with me, who is so hard on you, and write to me that you want to be engaged to Helena Antebellum\u2026 Should we kneel down and plead together?\u201dIf the Crown Prince said yes, I was going to go with him anyway and beg His Majesty to break off the unwanted engagement anyway. It\u2019s a problem because the Crown Prince wouldn\u2019t.You can\u2019t even say anything to your dad, so why are you taking it out on me?The more I thought about it, the angrier | got. Even if I sell an invention, someone who\u2019s more in a hurry should sell it, so why are you picking on me?To imitate Eris, who was obedient to the Imperial Family, I had to endure it roughly, and then he dared to put his hand on my face?! It was a big deal that I had to endure it twice.As we stood still and fought again, the servants gave us an urgent look. The Crown Prince mumbled in a low voice.\u201cUntil when do you expect His Majesty to adore you, for you have the gift of being a little distant.\u201d\u201cDid you ever have affection for me? | don\u2019t have one, but it\u2019s a novelty.\u201dYou bark, I\u2019m coming. This time I dragged the Crown Prince along with his urging servants. I hope it ends soon, so please cooperate.\u2018It is gorgeous and magnificent, but frankly, it has grown so much that the endlessly boring pre-dinner event has ended. No matter how cool it was, it was just uncomfortable to be wearing makeup and a corset. It\u2019s amazing to see that it\u2019s the same state for the Imperial Family.Get up early in the morning. I didn\u2019t eat anything, and I kept on feeling nauseous because of my tightened waist, so I came out to get some fresh air for a while during the break.The front of my shoes was narrow, so if I even walked a little, my feet hurt. I wanted to sit down, but I had to go out in front of people again soon, so I couldn\u2019t get my dress dirty.I was looking for a place that looked moderately clean to put my bottom on it, but I heard a strange sound somewhere. It\u2019s a bit suppressed. I think I can hear a buzzing sound\u2026There are witches, but I thought it was a ghost, so I followed the sound. What I soon discovered is more ordinary than | thought\u2026\u2018It wasn\u2019t a ghost anyway. Although a man in a ghostly sack was surrounded by a number of knights and was beaten.\u201cStand up, man!\u201d\u201cThe little one is falling out, and he\u2019s acting like a weakling. Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cAnswer.\u201dAgain, with a heavy hitting sound, the man\u2019s body flew back. The man in the artillery, who was rapidly waking up as if he had a great deal of pain, was not able to stand up easily this time.\u201cNo, sound?\u201d\u201cHey, get him up. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He doesn\u2019t have grit.\u201dAha, now I get it. The Empire was a country with quite a solid caste system. In the first place, it was a country where the Emperor was strongly centralized, but it was difficult if there was no difference in status. That means that someone can take over the emperor\u2019s position.Even Helena, the heroine in the novel, was only able to marry the Crown Prince after her identity was reinstated when she was cleared of the false charges.In a country with such a clear hierarchical order, there were only two ways for commoners to rise in status. Be it a knight or a magic engineer.Both were possible only if they had talent and put in some effort, but that effort and talent were not given to the common people.Unless they were outstanding geniuses, the fact is, aristocrats supported by their rich family were better off and had more opportunities for success. Of course, everyone who gets ahead knows it. Especially in the case of the knights, as Marquis said last night, noble escorts are often chosen to rise for the role.Naturally, wealthy commoners were united, and the poor nobles could not touch the wealthy_commoners. Even though they offered a modest bribe to avoid getting targeted in the first place.The fear and helplessness that they may not be able to get ahead was expressed amongst the poorest commoners, the weakest among them. They (wealthy commoners) try to relieve their anger and resentment by bothering them every day when they are anxious to death.\u2026\u2026Well, so far, this is a common occurrence in Korea. It\u2019s a place where people live, because everyone is there The question is whether I should go out or not.\u2018It wasn\u2019t only once or twice, but a long-lasting harassment, looking at the clothes being dirtied and being beaten up with cloth over them in case they could get caught for what they did.Even when I stopped them with a sense of compassion or justice, as soon as I left, was sure they\u2019d be vented on several times more aggressively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can\u2019t give up my life, and I can\u2019t help anyone in a difficult situation\u2026.While thinking about it, the man was kicked harshly again, and the bag that covered his body and face was peeled off.Oh, I recognized him. It\u2019s the man who put his shoes on me last time.The man seemed a little surprised to see me. The worries deepened. We don\u2019t know each other at all, and we don\u2019t know each other enough to be saved.It wasn\u2019t that little girl or that man who signed me anyway. Isn\u2019t it arrogant of me to pretend to know him? It was that idea that stopped me in my step.Thated those who hastily sympathized with me. Of course, I didn\u2019t like people who used or laughed at my situation when I said difficult things and asked for understandingBut even though I could do it enough, was more disgusted by people who were fussing and showing concern\u2019. They made me an inferior being by raising themselves by their \u2018consideration\u2019, and even getting drunk on being \u2018considerate of me\u2019.We were on good terms, but we didn\u2019t really like each other and his first impression of me was close to the worst.The woman who threatened to kill with one finger is now saving him from being bullied? It was deceitful.I didn\u2019t ask for anything, but nothing made a person seem ridiculous as much as helping. It was clear that I would be cursed even if I saved him.I turned around and he didn\u2019t call me either. That\u2019s how the oath ceremony began.The Empire strictly limited the number and timeframe of an individual\u2019s promotion to a knight to avoid private armies being formed.Since the knight ceremony is not held every year, nobles who want to attract any soldiers, or those who want to hire a noble-born knight to connect with, gathered like clouds.Some nobles were worried that they would lose the knight they wanted to take, while others were already giving out hints during break time.Thad to sit in the front seat because it was in the order of high status, but I gave up my seat to a noble who seemed more desperate because I would not be selecting anyway.When I stood at the back and looked around comfortably, I somehow focused on the heterogeneous knights. They looked a little older than the others around them and were visibly intimidated.\u201cThey were not chosen at the last ordination ceremony, so the appointment was postponed, my lady.\u201dPerhaps because he noticed my gaze, the \u2018foolish romantic\u2019 family knight from before whispered to me. (Q/N: the knight who accompanied her in chapter 3.)\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.And then what if it\u2019s delayed?\u201d\u201cNo one wants to have one that has never been chosen, my lady. Well, it may have been bad luck, but if you keep not getting chosen, there\u2019s probably a reason. And as time goes by, you get older and you lose your stamina. So after 10 years, you usually give up on being a knight and become a mercenary.Mercenaries may be better, but it was never a good ending for those who \u2018dreamed of an honour.Standing at the back corner where | couldn\u2019t even see well, there was the man who was beaten earlier. I cannot even see what kind of expression he was making. No matter how good that position is, it\u2019s hard to be chosen.\u201cWhat happens when you become a mercenary?\u201d\u201cWell, the wealthy commoners prefer clean knights to mercenaries of unclear origins. Besides, if you\u2019re a poor nobleman? Then the price will go through the roof. If you have a daughter, you can marry and aim for an increase in status. You can trade with other wealthy commoners who have a daughter.\u201d\u2018It was a hand me down tradition. No, I have to say it\u2019s a slave. It is a terrible future for nobles who value dignity rather than death.In the meantime, one by one starting from the Royal Family, they started calling out their names or raising their fingers to point out the knights standing below.The knights who were pointed at climbed onto the platform and knelt in front of the noble who pointed to him. The nobleman then was handed a sword from an attendant, using it to tap the knight\u2019s shoulders, slightly away from his head.At first, it seemed like a scene that would be portrayed in famous paintings, so I watched it carefully.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The last time I dared to disrespect \u2018myself with talks of romance.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t keep the past in mind.\u201d\u201cThank you for your generosity, my lady. But dare I say it once again. If there is no reason to decline, please take in a knight.\u201dI stared at the knight\u2019s face. It was an attempt to hear the reason. The knight knelt down quickly and met my gaze.\u201cThe lady\u2019s choice may save someone. Even if she dismisses him later because she doesn\u2019t like him, the knight was chosen by her so he could easily be picked up again by someone else.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThese men have given half their lives to become knights. If their efforts fade away because they didn\u2019t receive a single opportunity, wouldn\u2019t it be a shame?\u201d.\u201cYou are begging me for mercy.\u201d,\u201cYes, please have mercy.\u201dAs my turn approached, the number of knights decreased. The rest of the knights\u2019 faces were all dark.Savior. To save someone meant responsibility. It is more so when you save a man who is not a roadside beast.\u201cI\u2019m going to hire that knight.\u201dThe man I pointed to opened his eyes wide. I was handed a sword by my servant. It was a decorative sword, but it was quite heavy. The man, who came up to the urge, slowly knelt down.\u201cWill you pledge loyalty and obedience to me, Lady Eris Mis\u00e9rian, in the presence of God?\u201d\u201cEven if the path is a continuation of hardship and adversity, I\u2019m willing to follow \u2018it. No temptation will subdue me.\u201dThe hazel-colored pupil broke open in the light. I slowly patted his head and shoulders with a sword.I don\u2019t think I saved him with this. Even if I hadn\u2019t chosen now, he would have been willing to wait for another chance for a few years.But I owe him a debt of kindness. Even though his messy shoes were dumped as soon as I arrived at the mansion, I was able to return to the mansion without a single scar on my feet. A very trivial, perhaps negligible favor\u2026 This is to pay off that debt.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, but I don\u2019t have a name.\u201d\u201cYour brother must have called you.\u201dThe knights wouldn\u2019t have called him by his name, but at least his sibling would have called him by his name. When || looked at the crown of his head, he answered calmly.\u201cI was called \u2018brother\u2019 or \u2018elder brother because none of the kids in the alley were older than me.\u201dHow awesome. I don\u2019t even know a name that is popular in this country, but I was at a loss as to what to name him. Maybe can make this person have the same name as the main character of this novel.I was not particularly good at naming. I glared at his soft-looking brown hair for a long time and put my hand on the top of his head.\u201cThen Anakin, I\u2019ll call you Anakin.\u201dWhen he stood up, he turned his back on the sun and it was dyed in shadow. I remembered the passage in the novel that Thad forgotten while watching it.Eris, who was hated by everyone, had only one dark knight who loved her to the end.Now that I\u2019ve finished my work, I feel like leaving. There were some aristocrats who gathered and were trying to strengthen their power by promoting friendship, but I just wanted to go home quickly. I don\u2019t even know anyway, but it\u2019s better than being caught and making a mistake.The Royal Family gathered, so for now, I, the prince\u2019s fiancee, could not leave without saying hello, so I went slowly through the crowd.\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon. Your Majesty, and Ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous again today. The purple color of the Imperial Palace looks great onyou.\u201d\u201cOur faces are full of virtue because the Imperial Palace has sent such beautiful clothes to us\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for being late in saying thank you.\u201d\u201cHow humble\u2026 I heard that you said you wouldn\u2019t want a knight, is there a reason to have changed your mind at the end?\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to convince me, so do I have to go against the current?\u201dThe Emperor smiled cheerfully at my answer. Standing next to him, the Empress and the Crown Prince both looked like they\u2019re trembling. I guess I\u2019m sorry for the two who like Helena. Yes, let\u2019s break our marriage.I gave the Crown Prince a slight wink. It was a sign that he should say something. But the Crown Prince was hesitating even though he knew what I was asking.Oh, I knew what would happen next. In fact, the important event in the novel was not the ordination ceremony. Helena was a commoner, so she couldn\u2019t have a knight.Therefore, the ordination ceremony was described as \u2018the ordination ceremony was held\u2019, and was rather treated as important after the ceremony was over. This was because there was a scene where the warrior Jason came to the ceremony and pledged to become Helena\u2019s knight.\u201cJason, you can only take a knight pledge once! Why would you do that to me?\u201d\u201cI only want to do it once Helena, to you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 12 Die For MeHelena\u2019s embarrassed voice was followed, by a sweet answer from Jason. It was a pledge that he could only do once. This is because ordinary knights are lined up with portraits when the master commits a crime, even if there is no guilt.Even if the knight betrayed for profit, it was difficult to reach a good end. A man who betrayed once can\u2019t betray twice? No one would write about the knights branded as traitors.Thanks to this, knights rarely change even if their owners shifted the blame onto them. And they win in a spiritual sense by calling it honor.No, let\u2019s not focus on other people\u2019s romance. I was hiding because we will both be embarrassed if I got caught, and I would have gone out for nothing.Jason knelt on one knee. Pulled out the sword from his waist, and whispered to Helena\u201c\u2026I, Jason Kazar, swear allegiance and obedience to Helena Antebellum in front of God. Even if the path is a series of hardships and adversity, I will gladly follow it, and no temptation will subdue me.\u201d\u201cJason\u2026..\u201d\u201cHelena, even if I can\u2019t walk the same path as you, I want to be next to you to the end. Please allow me to do that.\u201dShe seemed to be in tears. A more submissive expression also played a part. Perhaps it worked. Helena\u2019s shaky hand slowly rose above Jason\u2019s head. And far away, the Crown Prince was watching the scene.The prince\u2019s face was distorted as if he had seen an incredible sight. I guess so. The friend you think you\u2019re closest to is confessing his love to the woman you love under the guise of being a knight, and she\u2019s accepting it without knowing it.Helena was so~nice, she didn\u2019t know the world and didn\u2019t even realize it. Seriously, what noble friend would swear once and for all with a pure heart to protect her for the rest of his life?It\u2019s almost like a wedding pledge if you change a few words and turn the sword into a ring.I deliberately made footsteps to bring them back to reality, stopping the Crown Prince, who was almost ready to fly out. My feet hurt too much to wait and listen further. The man and woman who were closely attached woke up.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I interrupt, Lord Kazar?\u201d\u201cOh, no.\u201dI\u2019ve been waiting for you to do everything, and of course you should say that, Mr. Oblivious. You know, this isn\u2019t your property, it\u2019s a public place.I was going to give him a reason. I looked back at Helena, who was embarrassed as evident by her blushing face, and added.\u201cIt looks like the Queen is looking for you, Lady Antebellum. Shouldn\u2019t you go?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s time already! Thank you for letting me know, Lady Mis\u00e9rian! Err\u2026 Bye Jason\u2026\u201dHelena disappeared in a hurry. Perhaps the Crown Prince would follow after Helena, and I didn\u2019t want to see that event. I\u2019ve already seen this event on the way out\u2026I was leaving, but I stopped and looked back at Jason.\u201cJason, you\u2019d better take a closer look around.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026\u201dJason looked dumb, as if he didn\u2019t know. No, wait, come to think of it, Jason was the Sword Master.\u201cYou\u2026 you knew that.\u201dJason\u2019s face was still calm. It indicated that he did it even though he knew that the Crown Prince and I were here from the beginning.When I faced the dark inside (Jason\u2019s thoughts), I felt bad. What the hell? Jason looked at my crumpled face and touched my hair, pulling it gently. Why is he touching?When I slapped his hand out of displeasure, he spoke in an infinitely gentle voice.\u201cYou look like you don\u2019t know, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cLast time, I told you not to blame yourself. Come to think of it, Lady Mis\u00e9rian might have misunderstood this.\u201dJason looked straight at me. He had a frightfully stern face.\u201cThat was a warning, Lady Mis\u00e9ran, let me be clear this time.\u201d\u201cWarning\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know why all the male characters in this novel are so wary of Eris on their own.Frankly speaking, Eris in the novel constantly bothered Helena. Moreover, she frequently committed very bad crimes that were difficult to glorify with the phrase \u201cpower bullying\u2019. Jason believed he deserved to hate Eris. Then shouldn\u2019t we, in the first place, just nip it in the bud?\u2018It is said that preventing diseases is important, so why do these morons let Eris plan the accidents and succeed?At first, I wondered who would save Helena first, but I left it alone to confront. Not only the psychosis, but sometimes the physical evidence will come out. You\u2019ve got power, and if you\u2019ve killed (Eris) earlier, you\u2019ll all be happy, why drag it on to tiredness\u2026\u201cThen stab me now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re holding a sword. You can stab me with that.\u201dAs I took a step closer, Jason faltered. Of course, I had a point to believe. To be exact, there is nothing to lose.\u2018If I die, it\u2019s beneficial for achieving my purpose, and if I don\u2019t die, the world will correct me for reasons I can understand.As I almost jumped forward, Jason dropped the sword and held my hands together to defend.This shouldn\u2019t be the case to kill me. Jason must have realized it, his mouth gradually opening. I pressed my face close to him with a blank look on my face.\u201c\u2026\u2026When you confront an opponent and give him a warning, be prepared to stab him or her right away.\u201d\u201cWho\u2026 who are you?\u201dMaybe he was surprised by my actions, but I didn\u2019t care. As Jason barely knew Eris.Personality changes as one grows, and he had not seen the process of growth because he was trying to catch the dragon. No, even if he had seen the growth process, he would not have distinguished her. Because he\u201cSir Kazar, you didn\u2019t care about me. That\u2019s a new question.\u201dThe clatter filled the silence. Neither I nor Anakin were particularly talkative, so we just stared out the window.In fact, there was one more reason I couldn\u2019t talk to him, even if Anakin was a real black knight, I didn\u2019t know him.In the novel, the black knight of Eris didn\u2019t even have a name. His face was never even described because of his description of \u201cstanding in the shadows.\u201dNot only his face, but there was no past or personal history revealed. He just did all the hard and bad things for Eris.The black knight, so to speak, was the only helper for Eris and the key to making her get through the difficulties.But that\u2019s what happened when it was Eris\u2019 black knight, and I wasn\u2019t Eris. Among the characters in the novel, Anakin was the only one who met me without meeting Eris first.Of course, strictly speaking, there was also Hubris. Hubris now thinks he met Eris for the first time, but in fact, Eris had met Hubris as a child.It\u2019s like\u2026 there\u2019s a wonderful backstory in the novel about Hubris and Eris being actually half-siblings\u2026.Gosh, all I have to do is to die quickly before it would be revealed and things become more troublesome.If a black knight doesn\u2019t fall in love because I\u2019m not \u201cEris,\u201d it\u2019s a twist in its own way.I couldn\u2019t ignore the possibility that my knight would be left alone.I don\u2019t have the will to live anyway, but that doesn\u2019t mean that a knight close to me can betray me because he has a crush on Helena more than anyone else.While I was thinking about it, Anakin spoke slowly.\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cYou must have had someone else in your mind?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t choose.\u201dAnakin looked straight at me. There was not even a single attempt to explore my true intentions. Just like the day we first met, that tired face, I can\u2019t imagine this man loving Eris at all.You don\u2019t seem to have any interest or lingering feelings in the world, but what on earth were you obsessed with?\u201cBut you can choose. I don\u2019t think you, the Marquis\u2019s daughter and even the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, would have chosen me with pure intent over all the knights.\u201d\u201cRight. I don\u2019t know what kind of nonsense the outside knight was making while I was away, but let\u2019s forget it all.\u201dI\u2019m sure he (the previous knight who begged Eris to choose a knight) must have said something nice or something like salvation. But it\u2019s not for that good reason that I chose him.\u2013 He whom you can send to places you can\u2019t go, he whom you can make to do things you can\u2019t tell anyone, and he whom won\u2019t reveal it to anyone\u2026\u2026 if he finds anything nonsense, bring him to die for you.Because I know Anakin\u2019s weakness, and he can\u2019t resist me even though he knows\u201cDying for me.\u201dSo I chose you. I\u2019m confident I won\u2019t let go of one of your leashes.It was a long day. I was going to wash up and lie down on my bed, but something flashed under my pillow. I thought he planted a bomb without me knowing, so I just reached out my hand and discovered it was a mirror. As soon as I tried to put it back in, I could see that it wasn\u2019t my face in the mirror.\u201cAck!\u201dI was so surprised I threw the mirror onto the bed. When she heard my scream, the \u2018maid ran and opened the door.\u201cMiss! What\u2019s going on?\u201dBeyond the mirror, the witch makes a hissing gesture. I flipped the mirror over so that she wouldn\u2019t be noticed by my maid. I took a breath and pretended not to know. I looked out the window.\u201cMaybe a bug came in. I have to close the window.\u201d\u201cYes, young lady. Can I bring you a glass of water?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can just close the window and go back.\u201dAs soon as she closed the door and went back, I turned the mirror upside down and shouted.\u201cWhat a surprise! What the hell\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must have been busy?\u201dThe witch had a slightly sulky voice. I was busy. She told me to always leave a mirror by my side, but I forgot about it.Come to think of it, I also had to tell you about my conversation with Hubris. If || can\u2019t get out alive, I\u2019ll find a way out even if I die.\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d\u201cSister said that the human body cannot break causality.\u201d\u201cThe human body?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 13Crazy\u201cThat\u2019s right. You need that kind of price to break the causality, and humans are too cheap in life for that. At least the heart of the dragon, the mother of nature, will be required as payment.\u201d\u2018It was like the story that Jason told me. But where on earth do you get a dragon\u2019s heart? Apparently, it was possible because of the dragon\u2019s help that Jason was able to kill the dragon\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cDid you go to the temple and ask how you could survive?\u201d\u201cThe procedure was complicated, so I asked the high priest myself. The law says it\u2019s possible only if the soul in my body of the other world dies. It\u2019s practically impossible because it\u2019s an empty shell.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026\u201dWhen I thought about it, I became depressed again. I cannot go out, and my life is too small to break the causality. That\u2019s why I hated living here.Every time I looked in the mirror, I was less surprised. The way I talked was the same (as Eris). I couldn\u2019t even remember how || used to talk. Even if I don\u2019t want it, my body is gradually adjusting to this place.\u2018It is terrible. This is not where I want to be\u2026\u2026 This is not my world\u2026\u2026 Medea whispered, as if to appease me, who is depressed.\u201cEven if you do not break the causality, you can go out.\u201d\u2018\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t break?\u201d\u201cCause and effect is a law designed to fulfill the mission that the world has given to life. It\u2019s the same to have a hero during turbulent times. Someone is born, acted, and died to save the world, and someone is born, and acted to motivate them to save the world.\u201dHow terrible it is that my life is sacrificed to be somebody\u2019s motivation.I began to get confused whether it was because it was the world in the novel, or whether the world I used to be in had the same law. Is there cause and effect in the world where I was?\u201cThe world is like a very sophisticated machine, and if something goes wrong, it\u2019s a series of broken things. There\u2019s causality to stop it, and it takes a heavy price to break it.\u201d\u201cWhat happens when the causality (rate) is over?\u201d\u201cUsually, they die. That\u2019s when you\u2019re allowed to die.As far as I know, if Eris is bound by causality, her mission was one thing. Killing Helena. No, at least, trying to kill. There\u2019s no one in this country to hate her that much except for Eris.The witch laughed when I hesitated, not being able to speak out.\u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? What you have to do.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t help me break causality, how can you help me?\u201dI thought she was helping me \u2018die as one who can\u2019t die\u2019. But she wasn\u2019t?\u201cWhen the soul of this land dies, it creates the reason to reincarnate on this land.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is this sound? Are you saying that I can be reincarnated on this land again?\u201d.\u201cWell, that\u2019s what the law says. But the witch is the one who twists and breaks the law. With a few sacrifices, you can lead the way back to your body when you finish your spiritual mission.\u201dI sighed in relief when she said I could go back anyway. I\u2019d try to save it if it wasn\u2019t asking for the life of the mountain\u2026\u2026 The preconceived notion of being a witch scared me a little.\u201cWhat are the sacrifices you need?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026 has not been found yet.\u201d,Ho-ho, the witch\u2019s smile has lost all her strength. Someone will die in a hurry. Is this making fun of someone? The witch whispered in a voice that is infinitely sweet.\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so angry. My sisters and I are both looking hard. There are few strangers who have already entered this land, but there aren\u2019t many strangers who want to return?\u201dThat\u2019s how it is. There was certainly no stranger in this empire, according to Hubris, that had ever left alive\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 No matter how witches were, they would still have to search the continent with the feeling of heading towards bare ground.\u2026.Wait, isn\u2019t the pay I gave her too little?\u201cShh, I\u2019ll get paid later.\u201d\u201cLater?\u201d\u201cEh, haven\u2019t you already signed a contract?\u201dWhat? Contract? As soon as I thought about it, I remembered an unknown liquid that I had drank at the store.\u201cYou cheated me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rule that you shouldn\u2019t drink anything \u2018that others give you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know the details of the contract, that\u2019s unfair!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair.\u201dSomewhere, a wind blew and brushed my cheek. It felt like being touched by a person\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019m holding your life, you\u2019re holding my life, right? It\u2019s a very fair contract.\u201d\u201cIf I find anything else, I\u2019ll get back to you. This time, do bring a mirror.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOh yeah. If something dangerous \u201chappens, look for a big mirror\u2026 okay?\u201dThe witch disappeared, leaving very meaningful words. Then only Eris\u2019s face was reflected in the mirror.I received a lot of information at once and she was quick. Come to think of it, after | entered the mansion, I didn\u2019t see Anakin. Are you doing well?\u201cAnakin.\u201d\u201cDid you call me.\u201d\u201cAh! Surprise!\u201dThad just whispered his name slightly, but Anakin opened the door, and my heart burst. How did you hear me? No, wait, if you had heard this voice, then you would have heard my conversation with the witch.Thad to pretend to be calm, but when I thought about it, my gaze kept shaking. Anakin looked at me and he said in a low voice.\u201cWould you please allow me to come in?\u201d\u201cOh? Ah\u2026\u2019Unintentionally giving permission, Anakin closed the door and slowly walked over to me. He knelt down on one knee and said to me as I was sitting on the bed.\u201cOne of the greatest virtues of a knight is to not divulge the secrets of the owner.\u201dThat was all. It was a sincere answer to know whether this was called comfort or peace of mind. But strangely, I was relieved.As I calmed down a little, the question of how he could hear my voice arose again. Unless you are a psychic, there can only be one answer.\u201cYou\u2026 are you a sword master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s similar.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s right, it\u2019s right, or it\u2019s not, why is it similar?\u201dUnless you are a magical engineer, the only thing that can hear such a small voice is a sword master, who can read other people\u2019s spirits.As far as I know, there were only two sword masters in this country, the sword teacher of the warrior Jason, now a retired high-ranking general, and Jason himself.The sword master, who can split the sea and the mountain, was truly a treasure for the country. So, if Anakin was a real sword master, he shouldn\u2019t be under me, instead, it would be more beneficial for him to inform the Empire right now.However, Anakin murmured, as he clenched his fist with a rather sullen expression.\u201cI can read the original form, but because the sword expression is incomplete. That is\u2026 not a sword master.\u201dThe reason that the sword master can split the sea and mountain is due to the manifestation of swordsmanship, and even if that is incomplete, it would still be worthBut if you don\u2019t say it\u2019s incomplete or impossible, it means you\u2019ll become a swore master within the next 10 years.In fact, that will be a tremendous achievement. He won\u2019t be able to become the youngest sword master like Jason, but since Jason is one of the original male protagonists, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201cYes, well\u2026 half master. You must have heard all of me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dIt was a winning move. Did you hear me, right? If you did, how would you behave?If he intended to accuse me of communicating with a witch, I had to think about whether to kill Anakin as it is or accuse him of talking bullshit. Anakin looked me in the eye and asked.\u201cThe lady isn\u2019t from this place?\u201dIt was an outrageous question, but it was actually a question that got to the point. He \u2018must have heard everything.Tpondered for a moment. Whether to answer with the truth, or to deceive him by pretending not to know\u2026\u2026\u2026.. He was never supposed to be my black knight. But it is also a story that he would know when he is working with me anyway.\u201cYes. To be precise, it\u2019s not \u2018Eris\u2019. I am not the person here.\u201d\u201cDoes the owner want to go back to where she was?\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Yes.\u201d\u201cCan I help with that?\u201dI started to become confused. Why doesn\u2019t it bother him? Anakin\u2019s expression was too calm.Isn\u2019t a stranger rare? Aren\u2019t you surprised that I\u2019m from another world? You even had contact with a witch, one of the most taboo things in the Empire?Doesn\u2019t he actually have a secret about his birth that I don\u2019t know? Turns out he\u2019s a descendant of a dragon \u2026\u2026 and now Anakin smiled a little as I began to look suspiciously.\u201cYou doubt me.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m crazy even when I\u2019m talking crazy. You don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d\u201c\u2026.It often happens when you live in back alleys where you point fingers at the world, for being crazy, and you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s crazy or not when you\u2019re born there. If a person who\u2019s not crazy goes in there, you become crazy like everyone else.\u201dThere is no change in expression even though he expressed haunting words. Apart from his appearance, there was little change in the muscles of his face, as if he was just like a mannequin.I wanted to see if the person I was talking to was there, so I put my hand on his face slightly. Warm. There was also a way to avoid it, but he was still, enduring my hand without any motion.\u201cWho the lady is doesn\u2019t really matter to me, because my work doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your job?\u201d\u201cYour command, I obey.\u201dAnakin\u2019s eyes were filled with a quiet madness. The strong will to not give heart to anyone.Anakin\u2019s eyes were filled with a quiet madness. The strong will to not give heart to anyone.Thad a certain conviction that this man would never miss work because of love. Even if Anakin falls in love with Helena out of providence, his loyalty will be with me.\u201cAre you disappointed when I say that the knight you had chosen has lost his mind?\u201dNo way.\u201cNo, I love it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 14LautenToday, I opened my eyes in this world. After washing up, refusing to be dressed up, and eating, I thought about Eris\u2019 birthday, which is just around the corner.In this country, I will have a grand adult ceremony, and it was obvious how exciting it will be since the Imperial Family offered to host it.\u2018It is impossible to turn over the issue now after the Emperor has nailed it, so I have to endure, believing that it will pass.Adult ceremonies were tolerable, but the problem was this. If an adult ceremony is held by the Imperial Family, Eris Mis\u00e9ran is basically announcing that she is a member of the Imperial Family, making it virtually impossible to break this marriage.I\u2019m afraid he didn\u2019t marry Eris in the novel, instead she was dismissed.There seemed to be no mention of it.Did the break-off fall within the causal range? I think the only thing that Eris did as a fianc\u00e9e was to bully Helena, but one can do this even after you break up.\u2018It was very annoying to treat me as fuel, to make another\u2019s love burn more. The matter of the Prince and Helena is even more urgent, and I have to make an effort to get out of that situation.\u2018Is this a case where there\u2019s a guy who\u2019s giving you strength and a guy who\u2019s crapping on you? Did I ask you to marry me? It had already been decided by the families!Suddenly, annoyed, I started yelling and kicking the bed, causing someone to knock on the door. It was embarrassing.\u201cHmm, hmm\u2026 Who is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..It is me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cMy younger brother\u2026 wants to see you.\u201dWhat have you got? My body rose up naturally. It is good news in this world, where there are only annoying things. By the way, I was worried about where to meet the scruffy kid.There are many eyes seeing, and my appearance stands out unusually when I go to the house.There is a saying that if you want to hide a tree, hide it in the forest. A crowded place. Where it\u2019s not weird for me and him to be together\u2026..Ah\u2026!\u201cTell your brother to come to the biggest dessert shop in the country.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dLauten was by far the largest dessert shop in the country. A five-story building.The building itself was more of an artifact, with a bright coral-colored exterior reminiscent of the Budapest Hotel and a white molding.The first floor was a bakery and a counter for take-out, and the official place for bread, and snacks was from the second floor.Bread was displayed on the second floor, snacks were on the third floor, and the cookie plates were laid out and numbered one by one.It was a structure where you select the numbered plates in advance, it gets picked up and calculated, then, it was either packaged on the first floor or prepared for it to be eaten upstairs.On the fourth floor, rich commoners sat, and on the fifth floor, it was prepared for aristocrats to sit down and eat.The fourth and fifth floors differ in its interior. The fourth floor has an open concept, with only tables and chairs, while the fifth floor has each room made with care. Even so, most nobles had servants to bring them (the pastries) home to eat.The fifth floor could be used, but other nobles may catch Eris entering a private room. So I decided to just use the fourth floor because it has the perfect setting. The people there must be busy talking among themselves to notice her.Still, if I go like this, I\u2019ll be noticed, so I need to choose a modest outfit and hide my hair with a big hat. Decorations also need to be changed to something modest and much cheaper.Since I didn\u2019t wear makeup or a corset, wouldn\u2019t this be enough to fool even me?It was nice to go around the second and third floors and choose something that looked delicious, sit on the fourth floor, and look around.After a while, the servant who came back with what I ordered displayed them one by one on the table.The aristocrats were given a five-tiered dessert stand, but the commoners seemed to have been limited to the level of three. Scones with clotted cream, jam and pastries, cakes, and crumpets with pickled fruits were beautifully contained.When the teacup and teapot were being set up, Anakin and his brother approached me from afar. Just in time. The younger brother looked busy watching.\u201cPlease, sit down.\u201d\u201cYes? yes\u2026.\u201dAs the child scurried down, Anakin naturally stood behind him. It was better than standing behind me, but I wonder if he should do this in a place where there are many people. Besides, I\u2019m currently posing as a rich commoner.\u201cYou sit down, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You mean me as well?\u201d\u201cThen you can keep standing in the way, of course. It\u2019s just annoying to me.\u201dHe pulled out a chair and sat next to the boy. To be honest, the size was made for women, so it was slightly small for him to sit on. Though that wasn\u2019t any of my business.\u201cYou said you wanted to see me?\u201d\u201cYes, the priest you mentioned before, we found the place where he now lives.\u201d\u201cWhere is it?\u201dThe child looked around for a while and then stuck out a note hidden in his hand. Bonito, it was a strange province. I\u2019ll go back and look through the map later.I was going to nod my head and take the note, but the child took the note, pushed it into his mouth, and swallowed it. I was so surprised that I looked at him with a bewildered face, but the child laughed with a casual look.\u201cI heard that confidentiality is the most important thing. I don\u2019t even know what was written anyway.\u201d\u201cWhat if you get sick?\u201d\u201cI grew up eating food thrown on the streets, so a small piece of paper isn\u2019t going to hurt me.\u201dHumph, the snorting child looked so cute as he pushed away the teacup. If you work hard, you should be rewarded.\u201cCome on, eat as much as you want. We can pack it if you have any leftovers.\u201d\u201cAre you sure\u2026? Do you mind if I eat everything?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I ordered it.\u201dThe child didn\u2019t know what to do, but then he started pushing food into his mouth. I was worried about indigestion, but I didn\u2019t bother to bring it up. Anakin stared at me as I said.\u201cYou can eat too if you want.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just?\u201d\u201cWhat do you intend to do? That place is quite far from here. It\u2019ll take a good 15 days.\u201d\u201c15 days\u2026..\u201d\u2018It was going to be my adult ceremony in 15 days. Should I go after the coming-of-age ceremony? I was thinking about it, but the child secretly raised his hand while eating.\u201cI can make it.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I want to talk to the priest myself.\u201d,Although he had retired, it\u2019s said he was also a high priest, so if he looks at me, he will recognize that I am a stranger at a glance. Then the story will be easier.First, I beckoned to Anakin. Anakin handed the child a small pouch of gold coins.\u201cThat\u2019s the amount I promised.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of your share separately, so give every penny of it to him.\u201dAt my words, the child couldn\u2019t hide his disappointed expression. You really tried to steal it.\u201cDid you sell those earrings?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause it would be a waste. It was the first time I worked to earn something and it wasn\u2019t taken away\u2026\u201dTaken away? When I stared at Anakin, Anakin blinked and said.\u201cIt is the boy\u2019s father. He got into alcohol and gambling, begging, and taking money.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you two living together?\u201d\u201cHe was drunk and got into a fight. He died.\u201dThe child spat on the floor as if it was a \u2018habit. He scraped it off with his foot.\u201cI\u2019m not a relative, so I\u2019ve been protecting him in the name of rent.\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d\u201cNow I\u2019m protecting myself.\u201d\u201cBut you still have a long way to go to adulthood.\u201dThe child sucked his jam-stained finger and spoke as if it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cThey\u2019re going to be acting as adults anyway. Far from thinking about being protected, we\u2019re all probably thinking about eating. At this point, all the kids in the slums are living on their own, so it\u2019s okay.\u201dHe said he was like that, so I nodded because I didn\u2019t want to speak any further.Suddenly there was a murmur around, and I looked up, and Helena and Hubris were walking from afar.Oops, I quickly lowered my head and pressed my hat down to cover my face. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t think they saw me.\u201cSir, are you not a priest? I\u2019ll show you upstairs!\u201dAn employee who recognized Hubris tried to guide him to the fifth floor. Maybe Hubris cared about people\u2019s eyes since he went up to eat. Then Helena poked Hubris in the ribs and shook her head.\u201cOh, no! Hey, I\u2019m going to eat here. Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Please prepare it here.\u201dHelena whispered as the waiter disappeared. I also stabbed Anakin by his sides and asked.\u201cWhat did she just say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a noble person, so I\u2019ll get in trouble if I go to the fifth floor.\u201d\u201cCrazy, really\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, Helena in the novel didn\u2019t know that he was the High Priest until the middle part. No, how do you not know?Because the clothes were different for the priest and the high priest, I could not not know. Did the employee know at a glance? No, and the employee guided him, so why did he step out and stop it? It was such a great mystery.After a while, a five-tier dessert stand was placed in front of Helena and Hubris. This was possible because the high priest was treated similarly to the nobility, regardless of his origin. Helena seemed unable to tell the difference between a five-tier stand, and a three-tier stand.Anyway, when the stand was placed, the atmosphere around them changed. The people in conversations started peeking at Hubris and Helena.Hubris was the youngest high priest of all time, so he was famous among the priests, No, apart from all that, it\u2019s weird not to look at the way they looked.Bright silver hair and purple eyes. Helena, with a lovely smile that would melt everyone\u2019s heart, always shone without a single light.Hubris, who sat in front of her, also had a formidable face. He had straight black hair on top of chestnut, skin color of the finest melted chocolate, strong features, and looked more like a royal from a foreign country than the current one.Furthermore, the garb of a high priest, who was dressed in a perfect fit, was clearly meant to be ascetic, but it\u2019s effects backfired as it created a sexy look, that calls for it to be peeled off.Helena and Hubris started a conversation. Anakin glanced at me asking if I wanted to hear their conversation, so I nodded my head. It was obvious even if he didn\u2019t say\u201cI guess everyone is looking at you because you\u2019re handsome.\u2019\u201cIf you like it, you can eat it.\u2019\u2018Sweet things make people feel good.\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to other people\u2019s eyes.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Such a pretty girl only says nice things, I think I would have fallen in love too.Furthermore, Hubris can see the color of her soul. If ordinary people\u2019s souls were just yellow, Helena\u2019s soul was colored with gold, and more beautiful than anyone else.Come to think of it, I should have asked. What color was my soul?Oh, he\u2019s laughing.Hubris laughed. Interestingly, even though Hubris is a human being, I didn\u2019t expect him to laugh so softly. Did Alex, who always frowned, and Jason, who always smiled, smile like that too whenever they saw Helena?It was a very strange feeling. The sharp difference between disliking me and actually liking everyone but me. Even when I tried not to care, the helplessness that was forced to come was a little hard.There\u2019s no one in the world who can help me but Helena. Then I looked up. No, there was someone.As soon as I sent the child out on route, ran to the witch\u2019s shop. I knew Anakin was running after me, but I couldn\u2019t stop. I felt dizzy.I managed to get to the door of the store, but the store was closed. I pulled the doorknob because I couldn\u2019t believe it. The rattling doorknob that refuses to open announced that this place was empty.\u201cOpen the door.\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cOpen the door!\u201dI started knocking hard on the door. If there was a suitable blunt instrument, I wanted to break the window.Passers-by glanced at me, but soon went away. They must have thought I was a mad woman.Anakin grabbed my hand and wrapped it with a handkerchief as I began to get a scar on my hand. I felt suffocated, strangled. I lightly scraped down the wooden door with the tip of my fingernail.Please\u2026\u201cYou said you\u2019d help me if it was dangerous\u2026\u201dThis was such a day.I thought I didn\u2019t really want it, but it became something I want to have because every child other than me has it.I don\u2019t even like vikings, but the mini viking in front of the elementary school sports day made me want to hold cotton candy that I didn\u2019t want to eat, and I don\u2019t care about the maker, but all the classmates have it, so I ask them to buy it.Now I know. Actually, I wanted to get confirmation. No matter how useless it is, I wanted to be sure that my parents would be happy to listen to me for my happiness. I say I hate them, but then I miss my parents, even if I say something really bad.\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t breathe. It was so hard mentally that I wanted to bite my tongue and die.I needed someone in this world who knew me. Someone who knows me and will like me. I wish I had at least one person on my side. So I ran to the only helper I knew, and the door was locked.I thought it was raining because my feet were wet. Looking up at the sky, I realized it was my tears.Anakin quietly watched me.I wanted to retort \u2018what are you looking at?\u2019. Instead he hugged me and comforted me, asking me quietly, without even consoling me. (T/N: in manhwa they Skipped this hugging scene lol)\u201cDo you want me to open the door?\u201dI nodded blankly. Anakin asked me to step aside for a moment. As soon as I took a few steps back, he picked up his sword and cut the door straight down.The wooden door, which was quite huge and sturdy, cracked.Before I could open my mouth in surprise, he kicked the cracked door, strode in, and looked around.\u201cIt\u2019s safe.\u201d\u201cUh, why did you destroy the door?\u201d\u201c\u2026? Because the door was locked.\u201dAnakin said with a very casual expression. There seemed to be no guilt felt for destroying the door. He even asked me again.\u201cWhoever you\u2019re waiting for, I think we\u2019d better sit down and wait. Did I misjudge what you wanted?\u201dHe spoke calmly and led me to a suitable chair. Yeah, if the door isn\u2019t open, one would need to break it. If you don\u2019t have bread, you eat cake, right?When I saw his ridiculous expression, everything that I had suffered suddenly felt empty. I was dumbfounded and laughed as I sat on the sofa in the store that he led me to.How long have we been waiting? Suddenly the witch who was coming in stood at the entrance and screamed.\u201cNo, I gave you a mirror to contact me but instead you decided to break an innocent door?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t break it. He did it.\u201d\u201cThe door was locked, so I broke it.\u201dThe witch pointed to Anakin in astonishment, and Anakin shamelessly admitted his guilt. A comical situation ensues.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about now\u2026..!\u201dThe witch hit Anakin on the back without hesitation with her long, beautifully trimmed nails, and Anakin paid the price silently without a single retaliation. I felt a little better because the scene was funny.\u201cI\u2019ll pay for the door, so stop.\u201d\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in a bad mood. Say something. So that I can feel better.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re arbitrary.\u201d\u201cSo are you going to kick me out?\u201dThe witch smiled slightly at my words and fixed the door with a single gesture. The door became intact, as if it had never been broken.\u201cIs it okay for you to show your skills to outsiders?\u201d\u201cOh, if I thought he was an outsider, I\u2019d have him leave at all costs. Like the first day you came.\u201d\u2018It was a deft smile. It was like that apart from the interfaith relationship, Anakin was not a man who would go to the temple and accuse the witch. I\u2019d rather forget so that I don\u2019t have to be bothered. Leaving that behind, she brought us downstairs.While I was still confused with bubbling pots and medicinal herbs. She made the teacup float, and with a single gesture, placed it in my hand.I was suspicious of what was inside this tea, so I took a sip, but only after making Anakin taste it first. It was a fragrant herbal tea.\u201cWhat would you like to talk about\u2026 right, do you know the difference between magic engineering and magic?\u201d\u201cIs there a difference?\u201d\u201cMagic engineering is fundamentally close to theology. No, not close to theology, but from theology.\u201dThe witch thought for a moment, then began to explain, hiding behind a cloth, as if showing a shadow play.People often say that theology is the study of life and magic is the study of death, but it is actually a false metaphor. Both life and death are governed by theology. Theology is connected with the truth that makes up this world beyond simply believing in good and evil, and in creation.For example, a life dies when it is too seriously hurt\u2026 the absolute and natural truth. Magical engineering is thoroughly exercised under that truth. To create new laws based on the truth of theology. That is magical engineering. Haha, don\u2019t you know?When a lightning bolt falls from the sky and hits a tree, it catches fire. This is a natural phenomenon, or truth. Mankind, who was taking this for granted, one day thinks of this.\u2018If you artificially create a thunderbolt, wouldn\u2019t it be easy to ignite it anywhere, anytime? The first magic engineer was close to an inventor. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called engineers.They found that formulating a formula yields a corresponding \u2018power\u2019. Once they set up the formula, they ran without blockage. The water vapor in the air gathers to make it rain, refracted light is used to create illusions, or changes in the temperature of the atmosphere is used to induce wind.At first glance, it seemed to be about \u201dcreation\u2019 but it was not, and this was impossible because it was a violation of the truth.Countless magicians tried tirelessly to get closer to God, but all of them failed, and most of them were cursed and faced a terrible end. So, gradually, rules were created and breaking the truth became taboo.\u2018If theology is the truth that makes up the world, and magical engineering is to set rules under that truth, then magic is a very different nature. Magic breaks, twists, or ignores all of those truths and rules.The reason I can let you go is the same. By twisting the rules of life that make it a must to be reborn here, you can connect with your original world.Of course, we pay the price. Although it\u2019s kind that humans cannot understand at all.I was listening to her and suddenly thought of it and asked.\u201cCan\u2019t a man use the power of a witch? Well\u2026 something like a wizard.\u201d\u201cA wizard? That\u2019s an interesting idea.\u201dThe witch laughed for a while and said.\u201cI have to make you laugh, but you make me happy. Last time you asked if we would leave any offspring. Magic is not an inherited trait. What should I say\u2026 It has nothing to do with innate \u2018talent\u2019 like magic engineering or theology.\u201dThe witch paused for a moment, then lit a fire from her hand. Beyond the flickering flame, Medea was looking terrifying. The sharp flesh that makes a person\u2019s heart eerie just by looking at it.\u201cWitches are a race that \u2018evolves\u2019 when they feel desperate. However, their consciousness must be strong enough to destroy all the truths that bind them. When they evolve, they are no longer a creation of God, but a completely separate race. Being a living thing allows us to be free from all causal rules and laws regulated by this world.\u201dThe witch gazes at Anakin, the only man in the room with cold eyes.\u201cMen are too fragile to believe in such a principle. They are emotional, easily understood, and have a hard time giving up quickly. No, let\u2019s go ahead and say\u2026 Shall I say that they have never suffered enough to have impulsiveness? In most civilizations, men are usually \u2018rules makers\u2019.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re so great, why don\u2019t people know of witches?\u201d\u201cThere are many people who will be in trouble when others begin to notice the existence of witches. These are mainly powerful people. Since witches don\u2019t come from a high rank, these people\u2019s justification and their belief that the basis of their precious status and power are given to them by heaven would be shaken.\u201dThe witch playfully drew a cross. She seemed somehow used to it. Before she became a witch, would Medea have been a priestess?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s erasing the existence of history altogether. The addition of \u2018Magic\u2019 to Magical Engineering is one of its initiatives. There was no such thing as magic in the first place. Everything I thought was magical was magic pottery.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were the only one who was persecuted when we first met?\u201d\u201cWell, each individual may have different standards of persecution. What do you think\u2026. Infested with worms and rats, threatening that if you don\u2019t give up your house quickly, they\u2019ll be more active\u2026 It\u2019s a definite persecution from our point of view.\u201dMedea pretended to cry abominably. It was all crocodile tears.By the way, she is out of her causality. If so, it was convincing that the existence of a witch did not appear in the novel. It is a character that the author, who is the God of the novel, has not set.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, though. Oh, even with great power, a witch cannot destroy the world.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dEven if a witch with such a heart appears, the sisters keep each other in check. In severe cases, we can vote to kill them. Well, usually, most of the witches who are tired of living apply for a vote that they want to die\u2026\u201dHaving said that, Medea somehow looked a little subdued. Then she looks at me and smiles.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, the stranger has what it takes to be our sister. If you wanted to stay, I could help you.\u201d\u201cI also think being a witch would be happier than being a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cYes. Having the human man on this side as a familiar\u2026\u2026.\u201dWe talked for a long time after that. Some futures that will never come true, but make you smile just by using your imagination.***(T/N: The POV shifts to Helena Antebellum)If you\u2019re low in status but beautiful, you\u2019ll have a lot of luck. When I was a child, my mother sometimes hung around in front of me with a knife.Grabbing my cheek and holding a knife again and again. She would let go\u2026 and then she\u2019d drop her knife and cry. Knowing her thinking, I wouldn\u2019t blame my mother for cutting my face.If our family hadn\u2019t been framed and destroyed, she wouldn\u2019t be like this. Sometimes on the days she couldn\u2019t hold back, my mother drank and cried until she became hoarse, missing her dead family. I soothed the mother until she fell asleep.Mother, don\u2019t cry. Everything will be fine.I was really fine, but my mother, in her heart, always felt like she owed me a debt. I don\u2019t even know that the debt comes heavier to me.Be nice. I can no longer protect you. Mother said it like a habit. To laugh no matter how hard things are, to pretend you don\u2019t know without saying anything.Like an idiot without a screw, I lived that way.I was as good as a protruding edge from the palace. Everyone felt sorry for me. Now a commoner and a low-ranking maid, but before that she was a noble family member and even had ties to the royal family.Since my mother was the Crown Prince\u2019s nanny, Alec was practically my baby brother, and Her Majesty, who had no daughter, adored me. When I tried to do the laundry or clean up according to my junior maid\u2019s routine, Alex or the madame called me.\u2013 Antebellum, Her Majesty is calling. Go ahead.\u2013 But, but I haven\u2019t finished my part today?\u2013 How dare you keep her waiting?While doing the laundry, the maid\u2019s scolding came. When I hesitated again and again because I felt sorry for the maid, she jabbed me in the side.\u2013 Let\u2019s go. Before you get in trouble again.\u2013 I\u2019m so sorry. If there are snacks, I\u2019ll get them and give them to you. I\u2019m so sorry.When I was a child, I was ignorant and stubborn. I did not leave until I\u2019m done. I thought it was right, and I believed it should be.When I came back from work, I was whipped to the point of bleeding by my mother for coming home on time, but I was rather proud. My burning legs seemed to prove my legitimacy.One day, I found a maid who was verbally abused by Alex for not bringing me in. She accepted my apology with a tired face and said,\u2013 You are in a position to serve them. Don\u2019t turn down the order.Only then did I know. No matter how sensitive they are to me or how much they love me, they and I are divided by a clear difference in status. I didn\u2019t have the right to refuse in the first place.\u2018If I don\u2019t go, someone else will be disadvantaged. What an unfair contradiction. Even if I go or not, someone loses.I felt like I was drifting sometimes. I don\u2019t belong anywhere, and they don\u2019t accept me even if they try to adapt.They tell me to go over there. After being abandoned by everyone, I had to come back to my mother and soothe her crying.That made me a little bit sad.When I think about it, she hated me from the day I first met her. It was common for her to secretly kick my shin from under the table or trample my feet with high heels.Even at a young age, she frequently ripped into me, lied to get me into trouble and enjoyed it. Because I\u2019m a commoner, the intensity grew worse when I realized I couldn\u2019t hurt her.There was a tea party with Jason, Eris, and Alec, who insisted I was his childhood friend and I deserved it.Jason said that it doesn\u2019t matter, but Eris didn\u2019t like the fact that she was sitting at the same table as a commoner. She lured me into saying something so that she could put me into a corner closet.\u2013 Eris! Please let me out!\u2013 Don\u2019t call me Eris! I don\u2019t know how many people are there\u2026\u2026\u2026 Do you really think you\u2019ve become a noble because Her Majesty treats you kindly? Or do you dare want to raise your status as a subject of the traitor\u2019s household?\u2013 But how do I do what Her Majesty\u2019s orders\u2026When she shouted in resentment, Eris snapped sharply with her eyes drawn between the cracks.\u2013 Why should I care about your circumstances? Whether you\u2019re pretending to die or breaking your leg, take care of it yourself\u2026\u2026. If you act presumptuously once more, you will be sold to the brothel so that you can raise your status as you wish.And Eris turned around and disappeared. I was left crumpled in a narrow, dark closet that wouldn\u2019t open. I might have been locked up for a few more days if the maid in the same room hadn\u2019t told him I didn\u2019t come back.Alec and Her Majesty went out in a fit of rage to find the culprit, but both I and Eris kept silent. The next day, they met again. Eris, as she hugged me, cried out loud.\u2013 Helena, you don\u2019t know how worried Iwas.\u2013 Lady\u2026.\u2013 Oh, just call me Eris. It was in front of everyone.And she whispered in my ear, \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d Eris grabbed my trembling hand and laughed dazzlingly at me.Yes, I think I hated her a little at that time, Since that day, if I was confined in a dark and narrow place, I have developed a condition where I cannot even breathe well.Eris was a child who always worked hard. \u2018If she was like others, she doubled her effort, and if she was less than others, she worked three times harder than others. She said she had to always be the best.I didn\u2019t know what drove her that way. She whipped herself like she couldn\u2019t tolerate mistakes. She\u2019ll always have another chance, but why would she think that being behind once is so humiliating?Alecto always had a bad word with Eris. The reason was that the Marquis had a snake-like sneaky side, and so did Eris.Alecto called me out, so I stopped working and came to him in the back garden. Then I saw Eris crying, out of breath, in the corner of the back garden.She was crying with her hands tightly covered over her mouth, just in case the cry could leak. She looked so small and young, curled up. I hid myself because thought I saw something I shouldn\u2019t have seen.Far away, Alecto was walking around to find me. And then\u2026.. As soon as she heard his voice, she wiped away her tears. In that short time, she wiped away her sorrow, armed herself with a thick mask, and smiled like a flower at Alex.\u2018It felt strange to see such a young child moving toward such a difficult future with such heavy clothes and makeup.\u2018If I were a noble, would I be stepping towards the same future as her? I couldn\u2019t seem to hold out. No matter how despised you are, one can\u2019t live like that.We will never understand each other. But on that sunny day in early summer, I decided I\u2019d forgive her no matter what she did to me.Regardless of my commitment, my mother \u2018hated Eris. No, it wasn\u2019t just hate, it was almost wrathful. The Mis\u00e9rian family framed them, and was blamed for the collapse of the Antebellum family.\u201cWe\u2019ll arrange the next appointment\u2019s venue.\u201d\u201cThat would be better.\u201dLilia, who agreed with Tession\u2019s words, turned her head and asked Karhan.\u201cBy the way, did you bring anything with you?\u201dAt the last meeting, Lilia told him to bring the most useless thing he had recently bought. The reason was unknown, but Karhan followed it faithfully.\u2018He carefully pulled out the object.It was a small box that the package had not even been opened .\u201cWhen did you buy it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. it\u2019s been about a week.\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s just the right time.\u201dKarhan looked curious about what she was going to do with it. Lilia stared at him quietly instead of explaining.She saw eyes that trusted her as she fiercely raised her own eyes.After confirming it, Lilia smiled lightly.In fact, at first, she was only thinking about listening to his worries and getting rid of Richard.But now, she sincerely wanted to help Karhan. He was not confident, and he would not even look at other people\u2019s eyes.He didn\u2019t know how to express his opinions, and so he neglected himself because he put others first but he wanted to change that.There was absolutely nothing wrong with Karhan. The world was just too ugly to survive with good character.The moment you seem easy, everything you have will be taken away and chewedoff.So, he needed to fix his personality before he gets caught.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been watching so far, you lack a lot of confidence.\u201dDespite Lilia\u2019s frank remarks, Karhan remained silent.He seemed to be feeling it a lot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Eris\u2019s screams filled the drawing room.\u2013 You did it on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u2013 Th-that can\u2019t be true.\u2013 You know I\u2019m meeting you, and you do it on purpose, right? How dare you\u2026 to me!Eris slapped me in the face at once. My cheeks swelled up in an instant at the harsh touch. But it didn\u2019t hurt at all.Oh, I\u2019m a coward, a coward. What a miserable, stupid life this is. The act for Eris now was, in fact, cowardly self-satisfaction. Tears poured out when I thought about it.\u2013 What\u2026.what the hell are you crying about? You always look like that.Eris looked at me, who was crying, and twisted her face and grinded her teeth in bewilderment.\u2013 You think you can be forgiven for crying or laughing with that pretty face. What\u2019s the difference between a pet animal in the royal family and you? Do you ever do anything that requires thinking?\u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026. I did it wrong\u2026\u2026.Her contempt came to me like a tidal wave. I thought so, as I accepted thewaves.You know, Eris, this is my first time in life, because I\u2019m low-class and I\u2019m brainless\u2026 that I\u2019ve only learned how to laugh. So let me know if you learn more than I do.Do we have a different future? Will we ever have a day like that when I\u2019m not pretty and you\u2019re not hated?No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t escape from the future of the snake as long as I\u2019m allowed. If I smile, I look pretty, and if I don\u2019t smile, they\u2019ll come to me and ask me to smile. (P/N: Snakes symbolise a prosperous future.)Actually, this wasn\u2019t what I really wanted. I have no choice but to fall in love.(T/N: Helena\u2019s POV ends here)Since the imperial family said it was the coming-of-age ceremony soon, I was also preparing for the region of Bonitaeo where the new priest in question lives.The Bonitaeo region is quite far from the capital, and it was a mountainous area that required a 15 days by round trip. When people are in difficult times, they go to the countryside and the priest there helps them with their needs.It doesn\u2019t matter the time it takes to go after the coming-of-age ceremony anyway.Priest Prometheus was the high priest who became famous for the prophecies related to Jason, and unfortunately, he has no contact with Eris. Besides, Bonitaeo was really \u2018Kangchon\u2019 in slang.Why would I go on a trip to a place like that? It does seem like I\u2019m going to see Priest Prometheus.Moreover, in the Bonitao region, there was no villa for the Mis\u00e9rian Marquisate. I can\u2019t lie about going to a place where there\u2019s no villa, and\u2026After I was troubled while looking at the map for a long time, the maid looked at the map and she said,\u201cIt\u2019s summer soon, so would you like to go on a trip?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u201d\u201cThen, it turns out that the Magico Train will open soon. It is quite fast and it can ride a lot of people.\u201dMagico train? My maid drew with her fingers from one end to the other end of her map. Her fingers crossed Bonitaeo.\u201cIt\u2019s a train powered by magic engineering. They have been building the railroad tracks for a while, and the cost was so negligible, and there was a lot of talk about it. They said that the trial operation has ended and it will officially open at the end of this month.\u201d\u201cHow fast is it? Listening to the story, it seems to be slower than a carriage.\u201d\u201cOh, but it\u2019s faster than a carriage. Don\u2019t carriages rely on horses? Magico trains don\u2019t have to and are at least three times faster than carriages.\u201dThis is it. I wanted to cheer, but I held back. Instead, I called Anakin after my maid had left. I have a job his younger brother can do. Anakin listened to me and nodded his head.To avoid suspicion, this plan requires one more person. Soon after, the voice of the maid rang over the door.\u201cMiss, the royal family sent you the dress for the coming-of-age ceremony.\u201d\u201cTell them to come in.\u201d The Crown Prince didn\u2019t declare the breakup with me in the end. That\u2019s fair enough, considering the events ahead. The question is how to deal with the situation\u2026\u2026..Teven thought of destroying the event entirely, but if I thought about the causality, it seemed that I couldn\u2019t get out of it anyway.Most of all, it was annoying. It\u2019s not even worth caring about, but I had to do it anyway. I was just going to give them a round of applause and ask them to play Janggu. (T/N: The janggu (or janggo; also spelled, changgo) or sometimes called seyogo (slim waist drum) is the most representative drum in traditional Korean music. It is available in most kinds, and consists of an hourglass-shaped body with two heads made from animal skin.),\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, I\u2019m going to make you the most beautiful lady in the world. Come on, breathe in.\u201d\u201cHa-eup!\u201dI\u2019d rather beg Madame for time to put my mind to it\u2026..Ugh, I don\u2019t like corsets. I\u2019d rather die than get sick.Finally, the day before the coming-of-age ceremony came. Adult ceremonies in this country have the custom where one cannot sleep at all for a day. Something about God\u2019s protection being released for a while on coming-of-age day, and when you fall asleep, evil spirits occupy your body?In the past, it started at 12 midnight and lasted 24 hours, but these days, I just go to the temple early in the morning to pray and receive blessings from the priest and stay up from the banquet until the next sunrise.Since my coming-of-age ceremony is organized by the royal family, it was said that sleeping in the Imperial Palace the day before would be good in the interest of saving time.Since the prince and the marquis only have to attend the night party anyway, I was ordered to enter the palace with only Duet, my maid, and Anakin, my knight.\u2018It was fortunate that I was allowed to enter the palace after dinner at the Marquis\u2019 mansion. If I ate with the imperial family during dinner, I would have an upset stomach.As I rode in the carriage, I stared out the window blankly and suddenly asked Anakin, who was sitting opposite me.\u201cWhat was your coming-of-age like? No.. Did you have an adult ceremony?\u201d\u201cThe shrine regularly does relief work, which includes giving divine blessings to children in the slums.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cAnyway, the slum children become adults earlier. Because they have to make a living. Most of the children attend to receive food and clothes at the end of the ceremony.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in other slum children. I want to hear your story.\u201dAnakin looked at me silently, then sighed and said.\u201cThey woke us up early in the morning\u2026. gave us an unusual thing to eat, made us pray, put some holy water on our heads and harassed us by hitting the floor with a hanging pole so that we couldn\u2019t sleep. There wasn\u2019t a banquet or anything.\u201d\u201cNo matter how poor it was, you lived in the capital, so there must have been a lot of support?\u201dAnakin lived in the neighborhood last time. \u2018If it is, it means that a coming-of-age ceremony was held at a temple in the capital. The temple in the capital would be the largest and richest in the empire\u2026 Someone must have been embezzling it.\u201cI don\u2019t know that. The important thing is that I received clothes and food at theend.\u201d\u201cIf they perform it with money, they\u2019re afraid it would be stolen.\u201d\u201cEven if they gave us an item, there were many people who would take it from us and sell it.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cI sold it before it was taken.\u201dWe made eye contact and smirked at the same time. I know how you feel. The hurry to get his hands on it before it\u2019s taken away. It\u2019s happiness that you can taste even though you know it\u2019s going to disappear soon. The New Year\u2019s money | received as a child was just like that.The money was all in my savings account, but how unfair it was that it was taken away by my mom when I was young and only one 10,000 won bill was left in my hand.When my friends bought what they wanted to buy, saying they received New Year\u2019s money, I couldn\u2019t even spend it because I would be wasting the 10,000 won in my pocket.\u201cWas there anything you wanted enough to sell off clothes and food?\u201d\u201cI wanted a sword. It wasn\u2019t made by roughly cutting out branches, but a sword with a blade and weight\u2026\u201dTasked when we almost arrived at the imperial palace because his face was so cute.\u201cIf you want a sword, can I buy you a goodone?\u201dAnakin looked a little surprised and then shook his head.\u201cThank you for your kindness, but a familiar sword is more comfortable when it comes to protecting someone.\u201dHe said so and followed me silently. He always walks about three steps behind me. He is not close enough to feel uncomfortable, but he can be there at once if someone tries to hurt me\u2026\u2026. Such a distance.I liked the distance. Even if you don\u2019t look back, you can check it with shadows.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, was so sleepy that I slept in the middle of bathing.It must have been hard for Anakin with me halfasleep, to ask for my permission in order to carry me. Though the temple was close by, it was not walking distance, so we had to take a carriage. Anakin pushed me into the carriage, and when we arrived, he pulled me out, but again, I wasn\u2019t fully awake.It wasn\u2019t until we arrived that Anakin, who literally brought me to the front of the Grand Hall, woke me up with regret.\u201cMy lady, we\u2019re here. Please wake up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Give me five minutes, for real.\u201dFive minutes to gather energy to wake up and demonstrate my skills. Someone pressed my crumpled forehead with their finger to straighten it out. Then, strangely enough, the urge to fall asleep disappeared.When I opened my eyes, Hubris was watching me with a fine face. Oh, right. He was the high priest. wondered if it was better than a completely unknown face. When I waved my hand, another priest put a veil on me.In the empire, women wore a veil twice and men wore a veil once. It means that both men and women wear a veil at adult ceremonies.There was also a religious reason. All the sins contained in the body were kept in a veil to prevent them from escaping, and holy water was poured onto it to cleanse it.After that, the High Priest put a hand-made veil anointed with perfumed oil on both eyes and mouth to bless them to not be stained with sins in the future,Hubris slowly poured out the holy water in the brass bowl. Cool water poured for my cleansing.It was cool, but the wet veil and clothes stuck to me, so I didn\u2019t feel so pleasant. No wonder they dressed me lightly\u2026With my tongue in my mouth, I closed my eyes and waited for the next turn. Hubris\u2019s hand passed the veil\u2026\u2026.?What? Why are you holding it still? When I opened my eyes due to the strangeness, Hubris looked at my face for a long time then hurriedly swept my eyes. His fingers were dry and soft.\u201cHoly Father, rejoice.\u201d\u201cAh\u201dAs I pointed out, Hubris again poured perfume on my fingers with a trembling hand. As I closed my eyes again and he touched both of my eyelids, he hesitated, this time on my lips.Seriously. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s done it once or twice, but him dragging his feet, really! I got annoyed and just stuck out my head and pressed my lips against Hubris\u2019s thumb and stood up.\u201cAll right?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yeah.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m busy.\u201dWhen Hubris failed to answer, I pulled the wet veil off and threw it down. My legs throbbed when I was on my knees. How frustrating.I went back to the imperial family, had a late breakfast and lunch, and took a short walk to digest before started dressing up in earnest. The meals of the highranking people were always unnecessarily large and heavy, so I felt bloated.Then, in the distance, Helena was seen running, as usual.She seemed to have no idea what she was going to be in the future. I thought I\u2019d catch her and give her a word, but I left it alone because I thought it would be better for her to experience the results for herself. There\u2019s nothing I can do even if I look into it.When I returned to the room after watching Helena, the fully prepared women welcomed me with expressions that one would have just before the competition.Yeah\u2026 let\u2019s just worry about myself. I don\u2019t know if | can make it to the banquet alive today\u2026\u2026 and as soon as I sighed, four women gathered together and changed my clothes.I wore stockings made of silk, and I didn\u2019t wear a corset because I insisted I didn\u2019t want to die, but instead they hung a cotton pouch that looked rich on the hips. One more skirt on top of that! Put on a light top, and then do it again with another skirt.When I freaked out about how many layers of clothes I was wearing, women comforted me by saying that it was summer and it\u2019s trendy, so my back was slightly open and that I had no panels on my chest.As I finished getting dressed, they divided their time to get my hair and face decorated. One was busy combing my hair and another was applying powder.They braided my hair, pinned it, and applied multiple makeup layers\u2026\u2026.. At the moment when I was exhausted and wanted to faint, they put on necklaces, bracelets, rings, and put my shoes on.The attendant was mesmerized by the sight of my face as she carefully moved the mirror. She put a fulllength mirror in front of me only after the court lady announced in a loud voice that was almost like a scream.\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026.. beautiful.\u201dCertainly I was a little unrealistically beautiful in the mirror. No, I was more like a craft than a human being.The dark green dress tailored to the color of my eyes was more of an art than clothes with the island\u2019s gold,thread embroidery, and the diamonds on my hands, ears and neck simply shone.Not only that, but the braided hair also had a star, shaped pin made of diamonds and gold. I couldn\u2019t believe I had a face that doesn\u2019t get pushed back even though I was wearing something that glitters like this. \u2018It was even a little scary.What\u2019s the point of working so hard like this. The person I can actually see has a heart in the bean field.\u201cLet\u2019s go when you\u2019re ready.\u201d\u201cWhat? His Highness hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t come.\u201dHe must have gone to escort Helena now.The attendant looked bewildered as I stepped out the door. It means that he already knows everything when he sees my action yet he can\u2019t say anything but wait.\u2018If you go to the venue and look at people\u2019s faces, you\u2019ll find out who\u2019s involved in this.As I strode along, there was a heavy silence. If you look at the atmosphere, it\u2019s not a coming-of-age ceremony, but a general going to war.I\u2019ve reached the entrance of the banquet hall, the people are stunned. Everyone was looking at me with \u2018No, why are you here already? Alone?\u2019 stuck on their foreheads. This was because it was customary to get escorted by your fianc\u00e9 if you have a fianc\u00e9.I scanned the area, and I saw Jason in a corner.\u201cSir Kazar, would you hold my hand?\u201d\u201c\u2026. What?\u201dJason looked at me with a face asking if I was insane. He would be like that, because while this is a comingof-age ceremony, part of it was about the engagement between the prince and Eris.If Eris had been alone so far even after the fact that she had been verbally announced as his fianc\u00e9e between families, then from now on, as his fianc\u00e9e, she would be treated at the expense of the Crown Prince.In addition to the expanded interpretation, someone else escorting me was like a declaration of propaganda against the imperial family. There\u2019s no way any noble here will do that.I chose Jason because he was on the same level as Eris in many ways. The eldest son of a duke family and a warrior who saved the empire. Even a childhood, friend of the prince, it was good to use that fact as a shield.Besides there was no knight in the empire that would refuse the request of a lady\u2026 Jason approached me with a grim look and held my hand.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9ran, the eldest daughter of the Marquis and fianc\u00e9e of the Crown Prince, is entering.\u201dWhen the servant, who had been wary, announced my position, Jason took my hand and slowly led me to the center of the ceremony.The eyes of all the nobles were drawn. All expressed very confused faces, but I decided to take it easy just because Eris was pretty.I was starting to become hungry, so I was looking around to put something in my mouth, but Jason grabbed me and asked.\u201cWhat happened? What about him?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see? I\u2019m sure he went to pick up Lord Kazar\u2019s partner.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJason asked back with a stupid face. I replied to the face as if it were something new.\u201cYou know she\u2019s not cold-hearted enough to stand you up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 that can\u2019t be true. It\u2019s a coming-of-age ceremony for the love of God.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026. It\u2019s the young lady\u2019s coming-of-age\u2026.. How come.\u201d\u201cThey say that falling in love blinds you.\u201dApart from that, it was a very sneaky thing. How someone tries to steal a woman to bring her to her coming-of-age. There was no such thing as a thief\u2019s symbol or such a thief\u2019s mind.\u201cHow did you know Helena was with him?\u201dJason\u2019s troublesome question was ignored. Well, I guess it\u2019s a big deal that I\u2019m here early. The servant\u2019s face turned blue.\u201cHere comes the lord of Eastern Kendall, protector of the Caylen River, and Marquis Mis\u00e9ran, Lord of Rimbaud.\u201d\u201cMy daughter.\u201dThe Marquis, who was coming in with a bright smile, suddenly stopped walking. Of course, the Crown Prince deserved it because he was going somewhere and with another person. As soon as the frowning Marquis tried to bring it up, the servant heralded a tumultuous disturbance.\u201cGive an example! The heart of the empire, the protector of the faith, the master of the land, Emperor Kratos I and the Empress enter.\u201dEveryone in the hall bowed deeply towards the entrance. The Emperor and Empress were greeted skillfully and they walked straight to me.\u201cBeautiful, beautiful. You are so beautiful that it\u2019s poisonous to the eyes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Your Majesty, and Empress. Since you provided a place for us in person, we will regard it as an honor to the family, and in the future, we will continue to care for the inner rather than the exterior and we will be more loyal than vain.\u201d\u201cFrom knowing you, it is evidence that you already possess a mature inside\u2026\u2026. By the way, the side of you is empty. Where did Alex go?\u201dAt his question I just laughed. Sometimes laughter explains a lot of things. But without that, the snow of today\u2019s storm quickly entered,\u201cHis Majesty, Prince Alex, the lord of the Maranello region and the knight of the royal family, is entering with Helena Antebellum.\u201dWhen the door opened, there was a crushing silence. Even a morgue couldn\u2019t be so creepily quiet. Some even rubbed their eyes as if they couldn\u2019t believe it.Oh, it was worth it. Helena is wearing the same dress as me right now.Helena was truly astonishingly beautiful, as the woman in the novel recognized as the most beautiful person in the world.Still, it would be dazzling because the prince brought an originally pretty girl and polished it. When I looked in the mirror, Eris wasn\u2019t really real either, but Helena added something else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 19ApologyThe aura is different. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a human being\u2026..As far as I\u2019m concerned, whether Helena was a fairy, a pure human being, or whatever, I had a strong feeling that God worked hard on her. To exaggerate a little, it was a beauty that was close to a final weapon created by mankind.When I was admiring Helena\u2019s face, she looked at me, or to be exact, at my clothes, and turned pale. Shivering like a tree, she refused with her feet pressed when the crown prince tried to take her into the ceremony despite being embarrassed by the unexpected situation.\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI want to change. Let me change!\u201dThe end was almost like a scream. Poor Helena, it\u2019s getting tough because you\u2019re beautiful. I looked straight at her and allowed her.\u201cYou may go change, Lady Antebellum.\u201d\u201cHelena!\u201dWhen permission was given, Helena turned and escaped, and the Crown Prince called her name anxiously.\u201cYour Majesty, I know you have a lot to say, but I want to talk to him first. Will you allow me to do this?\u201dI turned to appease the emperor before the already red-faced emperor burst into anger. The emperor gave his face a good smoothing over and nodded to allow it.What I want to be is not a tragic heroine. Gathering sympathy was enough for those days when there was no money nor power. I smiled and reached out to the Crown Prince.\u201cCome here, Your Highness.\u201dCome when I say nice words.I\u2019m holding it in because I want to kill him.Well, this is how the story should go originally. Helena should not be able to attend if she was originally in her position, but the story was different when Jason, a great nobleman, said he would bring her as a partner.Perhaps Jason sent a dress to Helena to match his clothes. With a gorgeous dress coming, of course, it would get in and out from the mouths of the maids, and naturally, the fact that Helena was attending with Jason would have entered the prince\u2019s ears.I don\u2019t care how jealous the crown prince must have been. Anyway, the crown prince made a plan to tell Jason that Helena is his woman, to screw me over, and to take care of everything.He dared to steal the clothes that Jason gave her, and even deceived Helena, who would have just put on the same dress. And I would have put it on too, and be outrightly compared.My dress was original too. This was natural. In order to make and sell the product again, designers usually leave an extra suit in case my clothes had an accident.The question is how did you convince Madame to give the duplicate dress\u2026. It was impossible for the crown prince alone.This is because Madame\u2019s main clientele, which is said to be the Princess of Amman, was not part of the royal family, but an aristocratic socialite. There couldn\u2019t be a way to give a commoner a dress that was ordered by a noble as it would degrade trust, and at the same time, the value of the clothes.They were determined to get Eris offended. And there was only one person who would want to make her feel that way.Empress.I usually thought she liked Helena, but at this point, she is hating Eris instead of favoring Helena.In the book, Eris waits until the Crown Prince arrives, and she will not leave unless he does. After a defeat, the servant dragged her out.I read that Helena, who wears the same dress as her and laughs with people with a more aristocratic appearance, while Eris ran away like Helena just did\u2026.. but I didn\u2019t want to do so, hence I came out first and it changed a little.Originally, the Crown Prince, Helena, the Marquis, and then the Emperor and Empress, and finally, Eris, came out.But when the message that I entered first came, the Marquis and the Emperor, of course, thought that the Crown Prince also arrived first, and departed earlier than expected.In the original, Eris\u2019s game was very different. It was also the anger that Eris, who was desperate, showed off her unfamiliar behavior for the first time.Thanks to that, Helena and the prince\u2019s companionship had been buried a little, but\u2026\u2026 Well, it wasn\u2019t something I wanted to worry about. What am I supposed to do?We were out in the hallway for a moment. The moon\u2019s light shone on us. The Crown Prince tried to open his mouth first, but I raised my hand to stop him.Where can a sinner open his mouth first? Every time he opens his mouth, he lies with excuses.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026 Do you hate me?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI wasn\u2019t asking for an answer. If he didn\u2019t hate me, would he have done something like this?No matter how much harassment is scheduled, having the first-hand experience was annoying. In particular, the Crown Prince\u2019s perverted taste was very annoying,I approached the Crown Prince with strides. He took a step back, and I put my feet on the wall next to him so that he couldn\u2019t run away at all.\u201cYou hate me, Your Majesty? You somehow want me to be sick and lonely, right? So when you came into the hall, you looked at my face before His Majesty\u2019s to see if I\u2019m hurt.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..\u201cBut I, Your Majesty\u2026 I wish I was dead.\u201dI was prepared to break it, but the small wounds will not hurt. I didn\u2019t want to see the crown prince\u2019s face, so I covered it with my palm and said, crushing it in his ear.\u201cSo don\u2019t try to hurt me. It\u2019s the same.\u201dLeaving the confused prince alone, I turned around and walked out to the end of the corridor. As I opened the door, Jason was looking down at me with a complicated expression.You\u2019ll have to change your habit of being a rat. He should be chasing Helena, not me, I don\u2019t know why he is here.I gathered all the patience I had and laughed at Jason.\u201cOh\u2026 Are you leaving Lady Antebellum alone? The lady was stolen by His Majesty. But, didn\u2019t Lord Kazar invite her? You have to take responsibility for her till the end.\u201dAfter that, I didn\u2019t make a sound and just moved my mouth. Move. As if he had read the shape of my mouth, he turned away with a confused expression. After passing through one more door, it is again the act of a splendid actress.When I enter, everyone looks at my face. No, it\u2019s not me. The person standing in front of their eyes is Eris Mis\u00e9rian.Those faces as spectacles that wish you will mourn, the cruel anticipation that you will make your downfall. So I had to laugh. Eris, you\u2019d rather be angry, but you didn\u2019t cry.If there is a side story in this novel, I wish it was your story, not the love story between Helena and the Crown Prince. So that I can understand what you were thinking and with what kind of heart you were jealous of Helena and loved the prince.But I don\u2019t know you even when I\u2019m in your body. No one in your world knows you.Poor Eris, the terrible world wasn\u2019t interested in you.First of all, it was a coming-of-age ceremony, so I walked to the place where the emperor and the marquis were. It was quite crowded, but the people, parted away to make it a path like a miracle of Moses. (T/N: Moses parted the red seas with a little help from God, of course.)The two laughed well expressionlessly, even though the series of events that took place was embarrassing I don\u2019t know how good a politician I can be at this moment\u2026.\u201cBaby bird, you\u2019re here. Did you have a good, conversation?\u201dDamn it, I\u2019ve lost my advantage. If the emperor makes such a conclusion, it becomes difficult for me to bring up my marriage. I looked at the marquis for help, but he smiled without realizing that he was looking at me.Oh, only then did I realize that the marquis may be on Eris\u2019s side, but not mine. He won\u2019t do anything to hurt Eris\u2019s reputation.Come to think of it, an internal combative relationship was not much of a scandal for aristocrats, whose fickleness was the norm. Not to mention, polygamy is officially allowed in the imperial family.To the extent, this marriage was a political marriage. I guess I expected too much from a contract that is in each other\u2019s political interests.Even if Eris is infertile, the prince is right, which means he will not break up with Eris even if he brings Helena.When I think about that, the Crown Prince is only annoyed with me\u2026 Oh\u2026 I thought he was very sincere to Helena. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m shilly-shallying on that part, even if I\u2019m trying my best.\u201cHoney, do you remember what I said?\u201dAre you talking about the 1980s when I wanted to wash my ears? I forced myself to open my mouth to the gaze that was pouring onto me.\u201c\u2026.I\u2019m not jealous.\u201d\u201cYes, right\u2026 You\u2019ve raised a wise daughter, Marquis.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s flattering.\u201dThey giggled among themselves and went crazy. Haha, hoho, just laugh, and didn\u2019t care to please me, so I just nodded and got out of the room.They won\u2019t break off the engagement even though the engagement is a mess\u2026.. I need to cause trouble again.By the way, it\u2019s a blur. In fact, Eris should run out instead of Helena, which was all the more so because the situation was reversed.I thought it would be better if I enjoyed the cool air, so I even took a step toward the back garden. A new year passed and the stars embroidered the sky beautifully. The wind was so nice that I briefly regretted that it would have been nice to have a drink while I was enjoying it.T\u2019ll go get some drinks later. Before that, I looked around to find a suitable seat and heard a cry somewhere.This time, I was looking forward to seeing if it was a real ghost, and unfortunately, it was a person again. It wasn\u2019t a bunch of green\u2026 It was Helena.Helena was in tears, and then stood up in surprise at the sight of me. When she confirmed that it was me, her expression changed even more hopelessly. I thought a ghost would look better than that.When she wiped her tears with her hands in a hurry, she struggled to deny it in a trembling voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I, I really didn\u2019t know. This dress, mean\u2026\u201dHelena closes her eyes tightly after giving a gibberish excuse. It was the prince who made her wear those clothes, but she couldn\u2019t get the prince\u2019s name out of her mouth in front of his fianc\u00e9e. Not only can it be regarded as a slander, but it is impossible for the commoners to accuse the royal family in the first place.She hesitated for a long time to see if she had that much sense. In the end, what Helena managed to spit out was neither an excuse nor a clause.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s you again. You apologize again. Neither the man who brought you nor the one who dressed you in my clothes apologized to me, but it\u2019s always you because you\u2019re the least powerful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 20UnderstandingLike a broken clock, she repeated the same words over and over again before bursting into tears.Helena frantically wiped her tears that were falling down with her hands. But the more she tried to stop, the more her tears kept falling. Helena smacked her head again and again. Like a child punishing herself.\u201cI cry too often. I shouldn\u2019t have done this\u2026 sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhat are you crying about? As a child, I wasn\u2019t allowed to be so sad when my mother scolded me. I didn\u2019t handle it well. I know that. I also know that in unreasonable circumstances tears are usually used for avoidance purposes.However, I hated my mother who tried to control even my tears that poured out without me realizing it. Tears don\u2019t need to be justified.I still don\u2019t like Helena Antebellum. I think she\u2019s too tactless, weak and stupid.But as I see you struggling to hold back your tears in front of me, I realize I was misunderstanding you.You don\u2019t have any pain, you\u2019ll be as happy as you are, even if your hands are unscathed, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no wound in your heart.But I can\u2019t bear to hug you even after I got to know you. To get out of this world, I\u2019ll have to put a knife in you someday.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay\u2026.. to cry.\u201dBut I can at least tell you this one word. Right? That\u2019sright\u2026\u2026..I came out for a walk to feel better, but seeing Helena crying made me feel worse. In times like this, one has to use the power of alcohol. Sitting on a nearby bench, I called for someone to bring me a drink.\u201cAnakin, bring some alcohol.\u201dIt hasn\u2019t been long since I called him. I couldn\u2019t pinpoint the time exactly because I didn\u2019t have a watch, but it would have been less than five minutes.He has already walked over to me with a wine glass in one hand and a small cloth in the other. It was sparkling wine. I took the glass and asked with a gesture of my head.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cOh, this is\u2026\u201dA small canap\u00e9 came out when the cloth was untied, Looking at the slightly distorted shape made me smile, (T/N: canap\u00e9- a small piece of bread or pastry with a savoury topping, served with drinks at receptions or formal parties.)\u201cDid you bring it here to eat? You should have been eating something more delicious. I saw a lot earlier.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you ate anything.\u201dIt was both funny and admirable to see that I was not allowed to drink on an empty stomach. I felt like I was watching the \u2018social life\u2019 that I had experienced only in Korea. Say hello, thank you for the food and then put the food in my mouth. I suddenly experienced a hunger that I haven\u2019t felt before.Since I was savoring the canap\u00e9s for a while, Anakin asked me if I\u2019d like more. I shook my hand in embarrassment.\u201cNo, it\u2019s done. I have no appetite anyway, I\u2019ll just get indigestion if I eat more. Didn\u2019t you bring your share of drinks?\u201d\u201cI cannot drink while working.\u201d\u201cEven if I allow it?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s an order, I\u2019ll drink it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important enough for you to order it.\u201dSeeing his straight expression, I suddenly wanted to play with him. I lifted his chin with a finger and smiled purposefully.\u201cWhat\u2019s important and what\u2019s not\u2026 I will judge.\u201d\u201cI will keep it in mind.\u201dI couldn\u2019t stand the matter-of-fact answer and burst into laughter. Anakin is the kind of person who doesn\u2019t tell jokes. I still tilted my head because I didn\u2019t know why I was crying.But I liked the fact that he understood it right away without saying anything. I would make him do a lot of things that he didn\u2019t know in the future, but it would be difficult if he was to wonder or ask every time.\u201cI\u2019m kidding. I won\u2019t force you if you don\u2019t want meto.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding.\u201dIt\u2019s silent again, it\u2019s hard for people who prefer not to talk much. This is why I wanted to drink alcohol, but I couldn\u2019t force myself to feed him what he didn\u2019t like,I sipped my drink with the sounds of insects buzzing by, and when I got tipsy enough, I started to talk again.\u201cTell me your story.\u201d\u201c\u2026You mean my story?\u201d\u201cYes, any story is fine.\u201dAnakin had a rare look of bewilderment. Perhaps because of the alcohol, I started slurring at the end of my sentences.\u201cBecause I\u2019m\u2026\u2026 curious about you.\u201dI was really curious about Anakin. Anyway\u2026 We were in the same boat. Just\u2026 just what did he do, how did he become a knight, what did he really want to do\u2026The stories we were talking about now are the perfect side stories that won\u2019t be recorded in the world of the novel. Anakin gave a dry start.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if my parents abandoned me or not\u2026. Because I don\u2019t remember them, and I don\u2019t miss them.\u201dAnakin was just looking at me. Now, rather than him telling his story, it was more like an answer to a question. Even on the subject of family, which makes people most emotional, it comes out dryly from him. Perhaps even when Anakin is dying, he would simply say \u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019.\u201cYou don\u2019t always have to have parents to be happy. Some families are unhappy because of their parents. I grew up as an orphan and left before adulthood because I was old enough to earn more than begging, and I met the child you met.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t hear his name. What\u2019s his name?\u201dAnakin shook his head at my question.\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t like his name. He said he was going to create a new one, so ask him the next time you see him.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll ask you something else. Is there anything else you wanted to be besides a knight? Why did you choose knighthood?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t use my brain because I didn\u2019t learn anything. I barely learned how to write. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a very good mercenary\u2026..and if it wasn\u2019t for you, I might have become a mercenary one day.\u201dHis words made me laugh again. Knights only have to serve one master, but mercenaries had to socialize with most people in the guild.If you don\u2019t build friendship, no matter how good you are, you will be kicked out of the political fight. Anakin just stared at me, not understanding my thoughts.\u201cI think you\u2019d look good as a wanderer, you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I do?\u201dA wandering knight who wanders alone and gets paid to help anyone who needs help. Sometimes the price is food, sometimes lodging, sometimes gold coins.After work, everyone wants to catch the wanderer, but the wanderer leaves again and walks on his own path without dwelling in the world. If this novel was a male-oriented novel, he might have been the main character.I finished drinking and left my glass. Without hesitation, I looked up to the stars, and noticed that the stars that embroidered the sky were different from the Korean constellations. I once again realized, that I was in a different world. I quietly asked Anakin,\u201cThe stars are beautiful. Do you know any constellations?\u201d\u201cConstellation?\u2026..hmmm. The Red Dragon and the Divine, oh, that\u2019s the Woodcutter.\u201dAnakin raised his hand and pointed to the stars one by one. Then he gently connected the stars and showed me the constellations. The constellations are infinitely unfamiliar, but he was so familiar with the way he draws constellations that I wanted to cry a little.Wrong. It no longer feels like he is made of letters in a book. Someday if I die, Anakin will surely be penalized. Maybe he will blame me. It\u2019s not just Anakin. Helena\u2026.. the maids of the mansion\u2026.How many innocent people do I need to sacrifice to leave here? What will happen to these people when I leave? Are they going to die?If that\u2019s the case, I just wish the world would be ruined with a flood of stars, so that if I die, those who suffer, and those who caused them to suffer will die.We stood around under the stars for a long time. It was too long to wait for the sun.The coming-of-age ceremony, which had a lot of talk and a lot of trouble, was over, and I prepared for the trip in earnest. I pleaded to the marquis that the coming-of-age ceremony incident at the palace was so shocking, that I had to leave to clear my mind.The marquis, who knew that I\u2019m not his daughter, suggested that I go to the nearby villa because I\u2019d be more protected, but I said I wanted to take the train.I couldn\u2019t say that I would go to the Bonitao region, so I decided to go to the Randol region, where the nearby lake is beautiful.In fact, I chose the Randol region because there was no marquis\u2019s villa near the lake, as there was another reason for not staying at the marquis\u2019s villa.This is because if I stayed in a villa belonging to the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian, there is a possibility that the people at the villa will monitor my movements.I wasn\u2019t curious about the sincerity of the marquis, whether it\u2019s the persistent denial of wanting to hold onto a moving shell even though it\u2019s a different person, or as one who can\u2019t give up a politicalmarriage due to political ambition. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter what the reason was.The problem is, you\u2019re trying to sabotage me.Anyway, I decided to think about it when the plan was revealed. I didn\u2019t know what would happen, but I\u2019ll have a headache if I worry about it in advance.I packed my trunk to the brim, and a maid adjusted my clothes. Before I knew it, Anakin, who came in, left first with my luggage. The maid took a long time to fix the ribbon and saw me off, speaking subtly, but with a big smile.\u201cHave a nice trip, miss.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cYou will surely come back?\u201dThe maid said so and looked at my mouth, as if she wanted an answer. It was as if she was speaking to someone who was leaving to die, not to travel. There were varying complex subtle feelings in her gaze.I don\u2019t know how she came up with that idea. Maybe was caught.But I never cried or made a mistake in front of her. I think I did my best to play Eris. Well, whatever my efforts were, fake can never replace the real thing.Since I was young, I wanted the sky to be clear at the moment I died. I thought it would be less sad if the day was fine. And it was cloudy today.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The days will go by.\u201d\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the time I get back, it\u2019ll be clear again. Right, Emma?\u201d*****T/rant: Eris finally acknowledged Helena as an innocent person\u2026.I am so happyBut the real angst is on the way :\u201dDPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how insensitive I seem, I can always remember the names of people around me. Nevertheless, deliberately turned a blind eye to it, trying not to let it show.I\u2019m the one who\u2019s leaving anyway. I couldn\u2019t get attached. If I was to return back to Korea, I would keep thinking about it.\u201cYes, of course, of course.\u201dShe smiles brightly and nods her head. I think I\u2019m getting a little teary.Whenever I was shaken, I would reflect on myself again and again.Let\u2019s not be mistaken. That smile is not mine. What Emma loves is not me. It\u2019s Eris, everything that favors me is all hers, not mine.The people who love me are not here, but beyond, in \u2018my world\u2019.There was a corner of the train station made of baked bricks that somehow reminded me of a novel where a certain wizard grew up. (PR/N: Hogwarts train.)This place was very similar to King\u2019s Cross Station, but in fact, it had to be so. From what I heard from a friend, the author openly stated that he was referring to King\u2019s Cross Station while describing the role.Knowing that, I secretly touched the pillars as I moved around. With the expectation that this writer might have set up a 9th and 3/4 stop. (QC/N: Something like a secret passageway? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t read Harry Potter\u2026)Hmmmm.The station was filled with not only customers who came to board the train, but also people watching the train running for the first time.The train had twelve compartments, excluding the engine room and the driver\u2019s room. It was rather small compared to modern trains. Among them, there were only seven rooms, the other five of those rooms were filled with amenities, so it was a luxurious train suitable for aristocrats to ride.After sitting on a chair at the station and waiting for a while, Anakin bought a ticket.\u201cDid you buy what I said?\u201d\u201cYeah, as you said, I bought all the tickets at every station where the train stops.\u201d\u201cWell done. If I buy them all, even if there\u2019s someone tracking me down and listening to me, they won\u2019t know exactly where I went.\u201dBeep beep. Then, with the horn of the train, the crew began to ring the bell. The crew rang their hand bells and shouted, \u201cHurry up and get on the train.\u201d\u201cThe train is about to depart. Move your luggage and put it in your room.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI looked around my surroundings for a bit. Acting like prey, drawn by the smoke incense, they arrived amid the buzzing crowd. I grinned. The prey had yet to learn of the hunter, and they hurried onto the train before darting away. (QC/N: People are tailing her.)Convenience facilities were located near each room. There were two facilities, then two rooms next to it, and then another convenience\u2026 and so on. And at the end, there was one room with each convenience facility followed by another room.Among the compartments, the most expensive was the first-class cabin that\u2019s in front of the last facility cabin as it was far from the engine room. Hence there\u2019ll be less noise, and with facilities located in it\u2019s rear and front.Unlike other compartments, which set walls in one compartment and divided several rooms, the first class cabin was single compartment and was also a room.Of course, the first class cabin was for Eris. But while she was the only daughter of the marquis, there was a far greater issue of protecting the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. And\u2026It cost an astronomical amount of money just to, develop the magic train and track it. To recover the money, the support of nobles and wealthy commoners were required above all else.However, the aristocrats and commoners were not convinced of the stability of the magic train.They felt somewhat insecure in the magic technique itself. It was hard for them to fathom, from their point of view, how a huge chunk of scrap metal they had never seen before can be offered as a substitute for a carriage.So, when I decided to use the magic train, the state took advantage of it and promoted it extensively. That \u2018even the delicate young lady of Marquis Mis\u00e9rian can use the train\u2019 is nothing more than a guarantee that the train is safe.Thus, they will risk their lives and deaths to get me to my destination safely. Of course I plan to disappear halfway through.In fact, I was going to screw three people at the same time with this plan. The marquis, the imperial family, and\u2026A string quartet was played by stylishly dressed musicians for the dining guests. It was rare to find such an excellent interior decor in the capital, the baroque gilt frame was dazzling.It\u2019s not just the decorations. Judging by the taste of the food, the skill of the cook on this train was comparable to that of the chef in the marquis\u2019s estate,But for some reason, Anakin, who was on her other side, was just looking at the food in front of him.\u201cIsn\u2019t it to your taste?\u201d\u201c\u2026You didn\u2019t have to order my share.\u201d\u201cWhat is this sound? Is my escort knight saying he\u2019s going to starve now?\u201dWhen I heard a remark that I would never accept as a Korean, my eyes went up. Anakin looked me in the eye and said.\u201cEven if I pay with my full salary, I won\u2019t be able to pay for the little food on this plate. It\u2019s too much for me.\u201d\u201cI pay you, I pay for this food, and I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so worried. I\u2019m not poor yet for you to worry about my pockets.\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026 I am saying that the food left by the master will suffice. I am used to starving for a few days.I could easily imagine how strangely distorted my expression was without looking in the mirror. At this unprecedented remark, I put down my fork and knife and took a long time to choose my words. But in the end, all I could spill out was this.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t even feed my dog leftovers. I will get you a new meal.\u201dFrankly, I thought I made a poor choice in vocabulary, but surprisingly this answer convinced Anakin. He began to sloppily shove food into his mouth. My eyes widened. It must be delicious for him to eat that fast,He said the best things to eat are expensive things. I ate as much delicious food as I could since I came here, as I had never eaten it in Korea because of the cost. What if my tongue gets accustomed to this expensive taste when I go back to Korea?Anyway, it was good to see Anakin eating well. Anakin was honestly a bit skinny. If you touch him, his muscles are harder than stones clustered together, but skinny is still skinny.Frankly, he was a bit slender for my tastes, but that\u2019s what I say to a lover. Anakin is not a lover, but my escort, and to use him for his original purpose, it is necessary to build up his stamina by feeding him well. (T/N: for my tastes hmmm\u2026.someone pls purify my dirty mind)As I ate my share of vanilla ice cream, I ordered extra food and pushed it in front of Anakin.Eat a lot\u2026\u2026 Anakin saw my insidious smile and became a little squeamish. Did I look like the witch from Hansel and Gretel? I turned my eyes out of the window when I became sensitive. Ha The scenery is nice HmmmOn the third day, I slowly started dressing up alone, according to my plan to escape the train. I wore a hat with a mesh on my head, let my hair down, and put on a burning, fiery dress.This dress was a bustier cut and boldly open at the front of the skirt. Red lipstick as bright as the dress, enough blusher on both cheeks to look like a drunk person.Finally, I drew dots with an ink pen under my mouth, and eyes. I didn\u2019t even care. I added a little bit more. The more noticeable the better.After dressing up, Anakin was called. Coming into the room at my command, Anakin even rubbed his eyes hard to believe the sight in front of him.\u201cLook and tell me I looked like I lived in the back alley Did I imitate them well?\u201dWell, that was surprising. I\u2019m a typical courtesan of this era now. Anakin saw me like that and asked me.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand from my short insight. Do you have to do this?\u201d\u201cThis is why people will fall for it. Have you ever imagined that Lady Mis\u00e9rian would pose as a courtesan?\u201dYou have to convince others that this isn\u2019t Eris at all. In that sense, covering the face or wearing shabby clothes looked suspicious enough.I was too big to dress up as a boy, and I wasn\u2019t good enough to dress up as an old woman, so I had no other choice. I put my index finger in front of my lips, signaling him to stop speaking.\u201cDoes it matter what I look like or how I talk? I\u2019m your master, Eris Mis\u00e9rian doesn\u2019t change. Let them be deceived, misunderstood, deluded. People only see and believe what they want anyway.\u201dI asked Anakin closely. Look at me.\u201cWho am I in front of you?\u201dAnakin immediately knelt down.\u201cThe person who gave me my name, my sword and my life, Eris Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. Now rise. Let\u2019s move\u2013the prey will be trapped and waiting for me.\u201dI told you, I meant to screw three people at the same time with this plan. The marquis, the imperial family, and High Priest Hubris.Hubris was staying in the first compartment, which was the second-class compartment. That meant I had to cross a distance of almost eight spaces.And I\u2019m sure the guy the marquis planted to keep an eye on me is also there. Unlike Bonitao, we still had a few more hours to go to reach Randol, so he probably felt it\u2019s safe.I\u2019m going to pretend I\u2019m the whore who followed Hubris and put my arms on him to get pushed away. It was a plan that I came up with after hearing that it was unexpectedly common for the priests here to play with women.Fortunately, after lunch time, the restaurant and bar adjacent to my room were empty. Thanks to this, was able to safely enter the first-class cabin.This was actually great luck. The special class I originally used was a private room, so if I came out of there wearing this outfit, no matter how much disguised myself, I would have raised their suspicionsBut if I\u2019m found coming out of this compartment, it was easy to mistake that I would have come with a first-class \u2018guest\u2019.Anakin was now following me on the roof. No matter how hard his impression was, I was wearing a disguise and he thought we would stand out if we crossed the hall together, so he said he can walk on the roof.I knew it was dangerous, but is it okay because the train is slow? I couldn\u2019t dissuade him from going up to the roof even though he said it was okay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 22HypocriteWhen I crossed the first-class room and opened the door to the convenience room, all eyes were on me, Some looked at me outright, some kicked their tongue, and some whistled.It was funny that when I was Eris, the glances that had never received before were now pouring out. Just because I changed my clothes and makeup a little. I moved forward, trying not to be intimidated.Even in the next compartment, the gazes toward me remained. There were people who tried to touch me outright, but that was cleverly avoided and passed.One of them looked at me and whispered to the man next to him. The man listening to the whisper nodded went past me, and headed to the back.Instinctively, I realized that the marquis had planted a henchman among those men. As I, in a hurry, walked a little faster, the man who was whispering stood up and slowly began to follow me. My palms are sweaty I muttered in a very small voice, trying to put on a nonchalant look.\u201cAnakin, the henchman must be at the door of the first class. Tell him I\u2019m washing up. It\u2019s gonna be a long time\u2026.and get in the second-class compartment quickly.\u201dAnakin can hear me, but I can\u2019t hear Anakin, so I wasn\u2019t sure if he heard me properly. I didn\u2019t stop walking for now, as I believed he had heard.The man was still chasing me when I opened the door to the second-class compartment.I was in a hurry, not turning around, because I was afraid he would catch me. Is Anakin coming? If he was coming, where would he come from? The footsteps of the two rang in the cabin.The sound of the man\u2019s footsteps was getting closer to me. My head is spinning. I looked at the shadow on the floor and the man was reaching out to me. I can\u2019t.I opened the door of any room in a hurry. It was reckless, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Whoever\u2019s inside is better than being caught by the marquis\u2019s henchman.And when I opened the door, it was surprisingly Anakin who made eye contact with me.He must have been running, as his breathing was a little hard. Fortunately, the owner of this room seems to be somewhere else at the moment. It was empty. Without fail, I whispered to him.\u201cKiss me now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPretend you\u2019re doing it. Come on.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, I pulled Anakin\u2019s neck with both arms. I slightly tiptoed, and Anakin propped me up by wrapping his arms around my waist.I twisted my head slightly and opened my mouth. He didn\u2019t kiss me, so I moved my own tongue and made a rough, wet sound, pretending to kiss. Frankly, I\u2019m embarrassed, I couldn\u2019t force myself to kiss him.Instead of our lips touching, we made eye contact. At a close distance, our sweet breaths mixed. Anakin raised the other arm that didn\u2019t hold my waist and carefully began to pry through the back of my head. I stepped into the cabin one step at a time, and Anakin stepped back to suit me.Until now, I had vaguely thought he had brown eyes, but up close, Anakin\u2019s eyes were brighter than that. It was a mysterious color that changed depending on the light.This time Anakin started making awkward squirming, noises as I fell into the colour of his eyes and stopped making noises with my mouth.Cute, I bit my lips to hold back my laughter. I heard the henchman kicking his tongue behind him. Anakin slowly closed the room door. When the door closed, fell off him.\u201cHas that guy completely gone back?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. Now I can hear him sitting in a chair.\u201d\u201cHaa, it\u2019s over. I\u2019m sorry I asked you to kiss me all of a sudden. Did you feel bad?\u201d\u201cNo, I did not.\u201dThat innocent face made me bitter. I\u2019m crazy. No matter how urgent, there are things to do and things not to do. I said to him as I opened the room door.\u201cNo, you have to feel bad. It has nothing to do with protecting me.\u201dTo be honest, it would be a little annoying, but I could have told Anakin to overpower the henchman and throw him out of the window because we would get off soon anyway.And the reason I wrapped my arm around Anakin\u2019s neck was because\u2026 I just wanted to get a little confirmation.My people are different from the people who used to look over me, they\u2019ll respect me.\u2026.Anakin didn\u2019t touch me. I was disgusted by myself for being reassured by the fact that I had initially attracted him out of sheer self-interest.You\u2019re so ugly. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m trying to judge and test him myself. I shouldn\u2019t let others do anything offensive when I was attacked, but people were selfish. (QC/N: \u2018you\u2019re so ugly\u2019 refers to herself, her thinking/behavior.)\u201cFrom now on, if I\u2019m going to do something personal\u2026 just say no. If I make you feel bad\u2026 don\u2019t forgive me.\u201dIt may not be as selfish as it was just now, but in the future, I could have made him do more than this.He can\u2019t refuse me, but at the very least, I hope he doesn\u2019t make any effort to understand me. I will only do bad things in the future, and he will have to get his hands dirty because of me.Anakin nodded his head silently, and I sighed, a little gloomy, and headed out into the hallway.In front of the cabin door where Hubris was, I lightly patted both cheeks to prepare myself. I didn\u2019t want to show any weakness. I lightly knocked on the door and went inside before he could give an answer.Hubris stood up and looked at me stupidly.Surprise. I smiled mischievously and closed the door. I had a lot to say to him before we got off the train together.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026 the outfit\u2026\u2026. what the hell\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs this outfit more important than the reason I came to you?It was then that he felt something was strange, so Hubris shut his mouth and began to look at me, I sat opposite the seat he was standing at and crossed my legs.\u201cI have to get off soon anyway, but my feet hurt so I won\u2019t stop. Are you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.are you getting off?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to see the Reverend Metheus. Take me withyou.\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, won\u2019t you be going to Randol?\u201dNo, how the hell does Hubris know this? Eris doesn\u2019t have any privacy? To be honest, I was surprised, but I tried to act calm.\u201cOn the outside, it is. It\u2019s going to be troublesome if it\u2019s known that I\u2019m meeting Priest Metheus. So, aren\u2019t I asking the priest to help and take me there now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re wearing a disguise. To evade the chase.\u201d\u201cIt is the priest who will complete this disguise.\u201dA long horn sounded. Soon, the station attendant rang the bell and walked down the hallway. It was a signal that they had arrived in Bonitao province. I naturally put my arms around Hubris\u2019s arms and said.\u201cPlease be an unscrupulous priest who illuminates the dark side for me.\u201dBefore Hubris could say anything, I sprinted out the door. A few nobles who recognized him looked at Hubris, then at me, and looked back at him with contempt.Hubris panicked and tried to pull my arm out, but I held it tightly to his side.We got off the train safely, got out of the station, and caught the carriage. The coachman looked at us as if he was looking at the most unscrupulous people in the world, but he wouldn\u2019t believe me if I explained that I wasn\u2019t a prostitute anyway.Even as Anakin approached to ride the carriage, the coachman looked at me with a pitiful look and gave me a carrot. Then he came up to me and told me to shake the carrot if I wanted to run away. (TL/N: I AM WHEEZING)I don\u2019t know what the coachman is imagining.Bonitao really only has fields and forests, so it felt rather strange that a magic train station was built here.I sat in the carriage and chewed a carrot while looking at the endless wheat field, and then asked Hubris, who was staring at me.\u201cWhat are you looking so intently at?\u201d\u201cNo that\u2026 These days, I don\u2019t think you are doing self-harm.\u201dThis time I was surprised by the question and looked at him. Then he smirked and asked.\u201cYou see that? It\u2019s fun\u2026..\u201d\u201cBecause the ends of the soul are split and torn.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been torn? Is it dangling?\u201d (T/N: omg she is so savage)\u201cWhen we first met, it was halfway through\u2026 Now it\u2019s back together.\u201d\u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 tear it apart again?\u201dHubris held my hand in amazement at the words muttered. At the same time, Anakin drew a knife that\u2019s half the size of a sword and held it against Hubris\u2019s neck. I didn\u2019t tell Anakin to take the sword.\u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s God-given life?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u201d\u201cThat existence itself is precious\u2026? What is so precious about my existence?\u201dWhen Hubris was interrupted and I asked again, Hubris hesitated. Of course he can\u2019t tell me.Because he is not interested in me. Hubris told me not to die wasn\u2019t because he liked me.\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to hear that someone you know is dead. Right?\u201d\u201cAre you even afraid that I will resent you? If I had held onto you just once, I might want to come back to life\u2026 What is it?\u201dLooking at Hubris I must have hit the nail on the head. He is starting to stare at me. Somehow it was refreshing. A hypocrite pretending to be nice.In fact, he pretends not to be interested, but is afraid of being criticized. Then, when the opponent crossed the line while craving affection, he drew the line with a straight face. You\u2019re too brazen to ask me to cross the line.That\u2019s how the original Eris collapsed. After learning of her brother\u2019s existence, Eris quickly became dependent on Hubris. Because she had no place to turn to. How nice it must have been to have a blood sibling.But the brother whom Eris relied on declared right before her eyes that he had fallen for the woman she hated the most, and he would cut off ties with her if she hurt her. (QC/N: the woman = Helena.)If you ask me if I\u2019m defending the original Eris, I don\u2019t know what to say, but if I were to be cold-hearted like that, I could have cut Eris off before she turned to Hubris.But Hubris didn\u2019t do that. Even though he knew Eris hated Helena, he was silent. To get Helena out of the way by eavesdropping on the plans from Eris.It was an obvious betrayal.\u201cYou\u2019re confident you won\u2019t regret it, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or are you talking about remorse for turning you into an enemy, the most promising high priest in the capital and the most promising one to be the next pope?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about the lingering attachment and fear that any human being has, not the fear of eternity.\u201d (Hubris)\u201cThen I guess I\u2019m not human.\u201d (Eris)\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d (Hubris)\u201cYou know what? A person, no matter how much they want to die, you can\u2019t cheer them up when they are so depressed.\u201d (Eris)In fact, it was still like that. I barely squeaked by like a doll whose battery was almost dead. A doll that activates when you press the power button, but stops without doing anything except for the moment.I am so mentally exhausted that I didn\u2019t want to do anything, but the sense of purpose to go back forced me to move.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard and overwhelming just to breathe\u2026\u2026 can\u2019t even attempt to die. Isn\u2019t it funny? Trying to die can also be encouraging. Even if you try to hang yourself, you need the strength to tie the cloth to the ceiling and put your head through the string, and to fall off, you need the strength to climb high up.\u201d (Eris)When I first came to this world, I only slept. I want to wake up, because when I wake up, it\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m back at my house. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m in a strange place, in an unfamiliar body.As I forced myself to repeatedly sleep and wake up, the body soon drooped and sagged. After that, I cried.\u201cThen you\u2019ll just lie down and procrastinate like a fool. You say I must die tomorrow, and the next day you do that again. If you procrastinate like that, one day you suddenly feel strong.\u201d (Eris)The day I first attempted suicide. It was a very sunny day. Even when I woke up, my head didn\u2019t hurt, and the food that didn\u2019t suit my taste went well. My gait was as light as a feather.\u201cIf you gain strength like that, you never know when you will become lethargic again, so I feel like I should die sooner when I have the strength. Do you know how it feels to fail when you barely gain strength?\u201d (Eris)\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d (Hubris)\u201cSince God has helped me, shall I pledge to live hard? Wrong. I\u2019m a fool, because I can\u2019t die properly and I keep failing. So on and on\u2026 over and over again. If repeat it, both lingering feelings and fear will wear out. No, no\u2026\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m just fading away, little by little.\u201d (Eris)The rattling carriage stopped. Hubris did not say anything. Silence is always better than clumsy consolation.\u201cWhy do you look like that? Are you scared? You\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll die right away.\u201d (Eris)\u201c\u2026..Yes, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d (Hubris)Anakin opened the door first and reached out to me. I pulled my hand out of Hubris and stood up.\u201cI still have a long way to go before I die, so don\u2019t worry too much. Don\u2019t people say \u2018each one has his own end\u2019?\u201d (Eris)I smiled gently to reassure him. In this novel, Eris\u2019s miserable death is the dazzling climax of the story that readers had hoped for and expected more than Helena\u2019s marriage.When I saw Hubris\u2019 back heading to the house of Priest Metheus, I suddenly thought like that. If this was a musical, not a novel, what kind of music would be played during Eris\u2019s death?If the world were a big play, what song would ring at the end?\u201cWho are you?\u201dIt was a very small log cabin that seemed a little cramped for two people to live in. As Hubris knocked on the door, a heavy old voice resounded from beyond the door.\u201cIt\u2019s me, my lord. Hubris.\u201d\u201cNo, why did you come all the way here when you are supposed to be in the capital.\u201d\u201cI heard that the priest is very sick\u2026\u201dBut Metheus, who came out of the door, looked very sturdy. It was understandable. Hubris would havehurried to get here when he heard that Metheus was almost dying.I slipped out of Hubris and greeted Metheus.\u201cNice to meet you, Father Metheus. I have a question for you, so I came to you suddenly without sending a message in advance.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can call me Lady Mis\u00e9rian, or you can call me Stranger.\u201d (TL/N: \u2018stranger\u2019 as in soul from a different world, the title given to Eris by Medea in an earlier chp.)Anyway, this person could see my soul, so I didn\u2019t have to hide it. Metheus nodded his head as if he had sensed something, then he turned his body and opened his door wide.\u201c\u2026Come in. It\u2019s going to be a long story.\u201dIt was a small and cozy cottage. There was no need for housekeeping as there were only the essentials, so no matter how retired he was, it felt humble for a highranking official\u2019s house.Hubris stared at me while Metheus went to get some tea.\u201cDid you send that child too?\u201d\u201cDid you only just realize? I thought you noticed from the train.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so nonchalant when you have lured a man on false pretense! Aren\u2019t you sorry for me?\u201dI don\u2019t know why he is blaming me when he didn\u2019t even check.It wasn\u2019t even that much of an effort to deceive him. I just told the boy from the slums to go to Hubris and drop a word.The child faithfully told a lie that he had sent a message saying, Please come, Priest Metheus is in critical condition\u2019. Hubris did not verify who the child was as he hurriedly packed his bags and boarded the train.\u201cNo matter how young he looks, you shouldn\u2019t believe what others say so easily. I cheated to use you as a guide, but what would you do if a trap was dug to harm you?\u201d\u201cGod will guide me.\u201dHubris stubbornly kept his mouth shut. It wasn\u2019t a matter of bragging about his self-esteem, but it was ridiculous.In fact, Metheus was just like the adoptive father of Hubris, so saying that was enough for him to get on the train with his eyes closed. I was also aiming for that, and he was really possessed by the words that Metheus was in a critical state.Although the illegitimate son of the Marquis Mis\u00e9rian, Hubris\u2019s mother did not inform the marquis that she was pregnant with Hubris. She was a foreign dancer, and it was clear that she would lose her child if she reported it.Instead, she went to the temple and asked for help. Hubris\u2019s mother met High Priest Metheus at the temple, and with his help, she safely gave birth to Hubris and raised him.Hubris, fortunately, resembled his mother more closely than the marquis. As he grew up in a temple, Hubris naturally dreamed of becoming a high priest like Priest Metheus, and because of his innate talent, that wish was soon realized.It was too late when the marquis later discovered that he had an illegitimate son named Hubris. Hubris had already become the youngest high priest, and he had become too famous to draw him into the family.Even if Hubris had not become high priest, the marquis would not have been able to bring him. Aside from his mother, Hubris respected and loved Priest Metheus the most. Any comfortable and luxurious life would be meaningless without them.High Priest Metheus finally brought out the crude teacups and refreshments. All of them were tasty and healthy.Most of the teas and refreshments handled at Marquis\u2019s and Laute were sweet.In fact, as a person who doesn\u2019t like sweets very much, Metheus\u2019s tea and refreshments were my favorite.\u2018Stranger, I don\u2019t know why you took a precious step to meet me in such a shabby place. I\u2019m afraid that a poor old man will disappoint you.\u201d\u201cThis is a question that only Priest Metheus can answer.\u201dI heard from Hubris that I couldn\u2019t go out alive anyway, and the witch taught me that I needed a dragon\u2019s heart to break the law of causality.I was curious about the revelation that the dragon made known to Metheus. And the fact that Jason was a hero is something that originally appeared in the novel, but what the hell has changed and what kind of content is it originally?\u201cLord Kazar said that the dragon violated the law of causality and manipulated you to twist its destiny. When you heard the prophecy, did you not feel any difference from the gods?\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s a little bit like a dream. I didn\u2019t feel strange at the time, but I woke up later and as time passed, I realized something was different.\u201d\u201cDo you remember exactly what the prophecy was about?\u201dAt my question, Matthews looked into the air and blinked for a moment. He answered in a calm voice.\u201cOf course I remember. It\u2019s still good.\u201d\u2013 A child born on the night of the third moon\u2019s waning will have to stab the mad dragon with a sword. Only that child can harm the light dragon, and during the day when the light dragon stops breathing, everything will return as it should be.(TL/N: \u201cMoon\u2019s Waning\u201d- The moon is called a waning moon when it is in the phase in which its visible surface area is getting smaller. A waning moon occurs between a full moon (when the visible surface is fully round and lit up) and a new moon (when the surface that faces Earth is completely covered in shadow).]\u201cJust like that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what the rationale is. It\u2019s because I\u2019m too small and foolish for the truth.\u201dWell, a groan came out of my mouth. I came here because I wanted to know because if you did know, then you don\u2019t have to take risks and come all the way here. I wanted to grab some other straw, so I asked another question.\u201cWere there any other prophecies in this land\u2026?\u201d\u201cAnother prophecy\u2026. There was nothing else that could be called a prophecy.\u201dI tried to think of the novel as that might be of some help, but nothing came to mind. Seeing my expression, Metheus said with a very apologetic face.\u201cIn the beginning, God didn\u2019t give prophecies, or oracles. There\u2019s never been a precedent, and probably no priests will receive oracles after that. I should have confessed frankly after that.\u201dThe benevolent old man soon covered his face with both hands and began to sob in pain.\u201cWhat I received was not an oracle, but the fact that the supreme existence of nature is \u2018predicated\u2019 made me shocked out of my mind. But I was afraid. I am a mere mortal. Yet after receiving it, I became a high priest, and because of that, I gained high honor.\u201d\u201cBut, my lord, you also knew later that you had been manipulated.\u201d (Hubris)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 24Your Soul\u201cNo, Hubris. Don\u2019t defend me. Although I can\u2019t undo ruining a man\u2019s life, I am able to reveal the truth even if it\u2019s late! I could have corrected myself that I didn\u2019t hear God! But I couldn\u2019t do that\u2026\u2026. I didn\u2019t want to\u2026\u2026. I didn\u2019t want to put myself in the mud with the glory that was given to me\u2026\u2026. I cowardly remained silent until the end and fled here with my back against God with the excuse that it\u2019s my retirement\u2026..\u201dSeeing the old man cry like that, like a child, made my heart ache. The compassion is spontaneous, but the consolation is not mine.Fortunately, Hubris was hugging Metheus and helping him drink tea to calm him down.Come on, let\u2019s think. The fact that Jason will be a warrior is a pre-built story by the writer who is like the god of this world. Is that why the dragon said \u2018reason?\u2026\u2026..What did the dragon change?No, did you change it? What if the dragon didn\u2019t tell Jason the truth? No, no\u2026\u2026 In other words, what if he didn\u2019t have to tell the truth?What if Jason had killed \u2018Another Dragon\u2019?Goosebumps ran down my spine. The setting of the dragon that Jason killed was not mentioned anywherein the novel. All that was said was that Jason killed the dragon. The setting of the light dragon was actually something I heard for the first time from Metheus.The reason why the supreme being, the dragon, cumbersomely manipulated the priest to make a prophecy, made Jason kill him.And I instinctively knew the answer.It\u2019s useless, like me.Gnashing my teeth, I tried not to tremble, but my voice and my hands trembled badly. I asked in a hoarse voice.\u201cCan\u2019t dragons\u2026\u2026 take their own lives?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking a bizarre question. Dragons are the greatest creatures that God has ever created. Nature\u2019s mother, nature itself. Have you ever seen nature take its own life? Nature only thrives with time. Only other living things can harm them, but\u2026 even if a little rabbit eats a little grass, it can\u2019t be said that the animals are dying because of it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dragons have a lifespan? You mean they don\u2019t die naturally?\u201cSomeday, the dragon will die. But would a mere human dare to guess the years? Just as an ephemera, cannot predict the lifespan of a human being.\u201d (T/N: \u201cephemera\u201d/ \u201cephemeral\u201d = lasting for a very short time. It is a beautified version for existence like insects, animals etc who have very short lifespans, they cannot predict the lifespan of humans. So he is saying how can a small (short life spanned, human) creature guess a lifespan of a great existence like a dragon.)My head was spinning and I was nauseous. I raised my hand to stop the conversation for a moment and then ran outside.In the grass next to the house, I emptied my stomach When I turned it inside out, my head, which was still ringing, felt like it was going to break.Anakin came over to me with a handkerchief and water. After rinsing my mouth with the water he brought, I asked Anakin.\u201cMirror\u2026. Did you bring it?\u201d\u201cYes, can I show you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask the witch. Let\u2019s go to the forest.\u201dHe took the lamp he had obtained from somewhere and went out into the woods behind the hut. I followed him slowly, watching his steps, until I reached the center of the forest, where a small pond shone.The moonlight brightly lit the pond. I reflected my face in the mirror Anakin had given me and called the witch.\u201cMedea, I have a question for you. Show yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you doing? I\u2019ve been thinking about using a mirror.\u201dThe witch spoke in a shrill voice, but now I wasn\u2019t in the mood to accept the absurdity. As I walked, straight-forwardly asked about the hypotheses I had put together, but I was more or less sure.\u201cIs it Another Dragon\u2019 that Jason killed?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh my. How did you know that? You always have a talent for surprising me.\u201d\u201cIn order to commit suicide, the crazy dragon made up a false prophecy and made Jason kill him? Because Jason has to kill a \u2018dragon\u2019 anyway.\u201dMedea gave a slightly subtle smile and rubbed her hair with her fingertips. Then she willingly told her the truth.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Dragon was a person just like you. It was a \u2018stranger\u2019. She, no\u2026 Should I call it her? As long as you are possessed by a dragon, your gender has no meaning.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with it, so let\u2019s continue talking.\u201d\u201cOkay, don\u2019t whine.\u201dAnd she began to speak slowly.Note: Medea is narrating the story, it\u2019s from the first dragon\u2019s pov, who we believe to be female. We\u2019ll have to specify the gender to use 3rd person POV. Yet, we are not confident if we\u2019re correct so we\u2019re going with 1st person POV, and after the manhwa releases the chapter, it will be edited to 3rd person POV.A stranger possessed the body of a female dragon\u2026\u2026 I was very satisfied with my new life at first. Since became the strongest creature, I could do anything! wanted.I lived my life to the fullest. I fell in love with another dragon that suits my heart and loved it passionately, and I raised my eggs\u2026\u2026 helping humans build a kingdom, watching it flourish.I thought I would be happy forever, but as time went by, I\u2026\u2026 I became exhausted.I\u2019m starting to feel bored like hell.I tried hard to shake off my boredom, but nothing could undo this crumbling soul. My soul, as a human being, was too small and fragile a vessel to hold the dragon\u2019s years.I wanted to die, but I couldn\u2019t.Dragons are one of the strongest creatures, enough to be called God\u2019s agents. I gradually went crazy. Even the same dragon couldn\u2019t save me. The dragons themselves could hurt each other, but they couldn\u2019t kill each other.The crazy dragon went to find the last witch I would associate with. But the witches refused, saying they did not want to kill the dragon themselves.It\u2019s not impossible to kill, but for witches, it\u2019s a very cumbersome and difficult task\u2026\u2026 This is because a match between the witch and the dragon is completely extreme. And given their power, it was clear that there was bound to be a commotion around, them.Instead, Kirke, the second oldest of the witches, gave me a way to die for a price. There is a child in this world who will be born with a fate to kill a male dragon, and I wanted to take that fate away.Kirke taught me that it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of dragon it is, since God only ordained the child\u2019s \u2018fate to kill the dragon\u2019.As soon as the child was born, the crazy dragon controlled the priest and declared itself as the fated dragon. And I waited eagerly for the child to grow up.The day the child finally killed the dragon, the whole world was seen. The setting sun bled instead. The other dragon, who lost his beloved crazy dragon in one day, was in despair. (TL/N: the first (female/crazy) dragon died, now her companion is left, which is the male.It was because he was the original dragon of fate and that he should have died in the first place. If the crazy dragon hadn\u2019t plotted like such. The other dragon, who was deprived of his fate, wondered how he could die, he thought and thought again and again.And finally, the dragon realized a blind spot in this world.To break the causality, you need to pay as much as the heart of a dragon. Yes, the dragon tried to kill himself by sacrificing his heart.But the world was generous to dragons, so even that was not an easy thing to do.It wasn\u2019t judged to have violated causality.Meanwhile, the other dragon heard the desperate wishes of the two women. The woman (Emma) was praying that the wish of the girl she was holding would come true, and she (original Eris) wanted to disappear from the world.The dragon recognized that the girl was able to fulfill her wish. Because the causality of the world, the strings of fate, were woven into her\u2026\u2026.The dragon made her wish come true.The girl\u2019s soul disappeared with the dragon\u2019s heart, and the causality to maintain the world, found the most suitable soul in the other world. To get into an empty girl\u2019s body and move it instead\u2026\u2026 your soul.I knew it, but I lost strength from all over my body. It was not fair, not a grain of my will was mixed. A hoarse voice came out of my throat with a cry. It was as hot as a boiler.\u201cWhy\u2026.. is it me?\u201cAnswer me! Why me! Why! Why must it be me! Some people must have dreamed of something like this! But why must it be me! Why! Why the hell!\u201dAt my cry, the witch said nothing. She just stared contemplatively. The callous gaze was too much to look at so I threw the mirror into the pond.I know it\u2019s not her fault.But I couldn\u2019t stand the reality that came before me.Splash. The mirror sank. My mind sank to the ground.My head was pounding again and I was in pain. If I had a headache pill, I wanted to chew it with my teeth.I heard rustling footsteps and turned my head reflexively, and saw Anakin putting a knife to Hubris\u2019s neck. He knelt down in front of me and asked,\u201cThis guy was eavesdropping on the conversation What should we do? Do you want me to silence him by killing him?\u201d\u201cHave you been\u2026\u2026 communicating with the witch? Do you know how serious that is?\u201dWhy is he talking nonsense when it\u2019s already hard and annoying\u2026\u2026. Hubris wobbled back and forth with shock. At least Anakin overpowered him with one hand. I looked down at him with a cold face and answered him back.\u201cThis act would be a felony for the people of your country. I\u2019m not from this country because I\u2019m a stranger in the first place.\u201cIf you\u2019re inside Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s body, it\u2019s a crime!\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dIt was ridiculous and I laughed. Seeing my smile, Hubris\u2019s expression was distorted.\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cAre you going to file a complaint with the Vatican? All right, that\u2019s what I was hoping for. My body wouldn\u2019t die even if I stabbed myself but you wouldn\u2019t know if was burned at the stake. Go ahead and accuse me.\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian!\u201dAt my sarcasm, Hubris raised his voice and became angry. Anakin\u2019s blade clenched close to his neck.\u201cAnakin, release High Priest Hubris. Only then will he be able to accuse me.\u201dAnakin sheathed his sword with a hint of disapproval and shook him off. When Anakin put the sword back in, I strode up to Anakin and pulled out his sword once more. I threw it in front of Hubris, and his head slowly went up. I looked down at him and whispered.\u201cOh, there was no need for that? Come to think of it, a High Priest has the authority to make a quick decision, right?\u201dThe High Priest had the right to judge a woman suspected of being a witch. No evidence was needed Most of the high priests could see the soul.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 25ForlornThat\u2019s right, in the novel, even though Hubris knew that Eris was not a witch, Eris still felt threatened by the mention of it.That day Hubris said to crying Eris. He didn\u2019t cut Eris because he didn\u2019t want her dirty blood on his hands.Eris cried and shouted at Hubris in a chilling tone. Do you like that low-blood bitch so much? How can you put her before your blood sister?Never once did I think of you as a sister, Hubris affirmed. Then he left to grab Helena with his clean hands\u2019.\u201cKill me with that knife. The woman who\u2019s in contact with a witch is a witch, right? Why don\u2019t you cut me when you\u2019re so angry? Is my blood dirty?\u201dThe reason was simple. Eris in the novel was a bitch who bullied Helena, but I didn\u2019t, yet.You don\u2019t have to be a bitch. Such a bitch deserves to be guilty. What a ridiculous and shallow way of thinking.I thought it was justice on a subject that bothers people.I laughed like a madman in front of Hubris, who couldn\u2019t do anything, and soon squatted down and said, eye-to-eye with him.\u201cPriest, it\u2019s not a difficult request. Just keep pretending you don\u2019t know me like you do now. The fact that I\u2019m a stranger\u2026 The fact that I\u2019m communicating with a witch\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I will die soon. But I promise. I will not die in front of you, and even if I become a ghost, I will not appear in front of you.Hubris was now shedding tears. He said he couldn\u2019t understand. (T/N: / want to see this scene in manhwa)\u201cWhy, why are you talking like that? I didn\u2019t say it out of fear. Your sorrow is painful. It\u2019s too heavy.\u201dHe held head in agony. To be honest I never understood why he was responding like that.I\u2019m only doing bad things to him\u2026\u2026. Is he a pervert too?\u201c\u2026..No, it\u2019s not. What should I do? I want to ask for forgiveness for your anger\u2026\u2026. So, please\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to die?\u201dHe raised his head at my question. His wet eyes shining like obsidian under the moonlight were beautiful.(T/N: \u2018obsidian\u2019: a hard, dark, glasslike volcanic rock formed by the rapid solidification of lava without crystallization.)Aha. I know that look. I grew up watching that so much that my teeth trembled. That hateful face that says that only you can be their savior.I reached out and grabbed Hubris\u2019s face. I gently wiped away his tears with both thumbs, as he did for me at my coming of age ceremony.\u201cDon\u2019t pity me. It annoys me.\u201dHubris\u2019s face is dyed with despair.It is really nice to see.As I blinked, Anakin, who had been standing aside waiting for my order, came and knocked the back of his neck with the back of a knife.Hubris fell powerlessly into my arms. I threw him at Anakin and nodded.\u201cLeave this in front of the hut again. We\u2019ll stop by Rundol for a while and then return to the capital.\u201d\u201cAre you done with your business here?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard everything I needed to hear, so I\u2019ll leave before they get more suspicious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get the carriage. Would you like to wait here?\u201dIt was a black night with the loud cries of birds. nodded, thinking that a mountain beast would be better than a woman alone on a rural road.Anakin slung the Hubris over his shoulders, muffled his footsteps and disappeared.I dipped my feet quietly in the pond. I had dipped my feet to calm myself down, but as the cold water dug between my toes, I felt drowsier. As I lay down on the lawn as it was, I saw the constellation that Anakin had drawn over the round sky.Let\u2019s think. What happened to Eris after the coming of age ceremony. Thinking\u2026. Remembering\u2026\u2026. I needed to prepare\u2026\u2026 It was annoying.Why should I prepare? I didn\u2019t come into this world because I wanted to. No matter what I do, people will hate me, and nothing will get better.Can\u2019t I just let him hate me and when the time comes, I can pretend to kill Helena and be put to death?I was terribly tired. It was like the plot of a B-grade horror movie, that I was dragged into because of something someone did to die, and this time I have to try to die.I\u2019d rather have an accident and enter\u2026.. or, if the door of the dimensional gate had been opened and I had been chosen because the world needs me, it would not have been so futile.Instead, I was kidnapped into this world to make up for someone\u2019s mistake. To be someone\u2019s replacement\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not complaining because I\u2019m not the main character. Even in Korea, I was more of a supporting, role than a leading role. As an ordinary extra, studied, worked, and endured day by day like everyone else. But, at least in those days, something changed when I tried.There were many people who liked me, and there were those who would comfort me without doubtinganything if I told them my honest feelings. Unlike here\u2026\u2026 Yes, unlike here!My eyes were blurry. Tears fell before I could even try to hold them back.I can\u2019t change anything here. I will persevere in order to make others shine as planned, and eventually I will be executed according to the fixed ending.Neither an earlier death nor a later death will be permitted.I clenched my teeth and swore. I won\u2019t do anything in the future. Never\u2026.. Nothing\u2026\u2026 Anakin looked down at me as if he had just returned from work.\u201cYou\u2019re really fast.\u201d\u201cI was worried.\u201d\u201cWorried about me? Why?\u201d\u201cI was worried that you might have left me somewhere.\u201d\u201cYou think I might have died?\u201dHe looked at me without saying anything.No. He shook his head. He opened and closed his mouth again and again, as if trying to find a suitable expression, choosing his words.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m curious about the owner.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe words he finally spit out resembled me.\u201cLike I said I was curious\u2026 I wonder what kind of life you have lived and what kind of life you want to live\u2026 Yes, I dared to wonder.\u201d\u201cSo I was scared. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t get to know you.\u201dI was dumbfounded by his answer.I wish I could read Anakin like the other male characters. Then I could understand why he looked at me like that.No, as a matter of fact, I knew. Anakin falls in love with Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Unlike Hubris, however, Anakin\u2019s face did not contain any emotion.What are you thinking? I was scared to ask.I decided to postpone the question which I\u2019ll ask one day, just a little bit.\u201cCome here, carry me. I don\u2019t want to walk.\u201dInstead, I extended my arm to him. He grabbed my shoulder blade carefully. Placing his wrists on my hips, he began to wander through the dark blue forest without saying a word.I put my head on his firm chest and stopped thinking. When I stopped thinking about making noise, I heard a different sound. The sound of birds, the cry of bugs, the sound of footsteps rustling.And Anakin\u2019s slow heartbeat. His pulse doesn\u2019t speak of love yet. That somehow reassured me. It was burdensome if your favor originated from love. There was nothing like love that couldn\u2019t be reciprocated that puts a person in trouble.(T/N: \u2018His pulse doesn\u2019t speak of love yet: it means his heart isn\u2019t racing while he is carrying her so this means he hasn\u2019t fallen in love with her and this made her assured.)The slow but regular sound was very pleasing to the ear, and I thought he would like to walk as long as possible.The carriage rattled. We were on our way to the Rundol region to reduce as much suspicion as possible. What can the Marquis say if Eris makes excuses for getting it wrong by mistake?By the way, it seems that the driver who dropped us off at Priest Metheus\u2019s house was the only driver in the Bonitao region.I could hear the driver\u2019s yawn as I was sleeping.The driver may hear it, but he won\u2019t understand me because he doesn\u2019t know me anyway. I couldn\u2019t sleep and I got tired of looking outside, so I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cThe place where I lived\u2026 was far more advanced than the empire. There was no such thing as a God of high priesthood, but there were religions similar to those. Of course, that religion was not the state religion. It was a country with freedom of religion. There was such a thing as advanced \u2018science Science\u2026 Well, it\u2019s a little difficult for me to explain. think it\u2019s a science that clearly reveals certain truths that make up the world.\u201dAnakin was silently listening to me. I pondered for a moment about what to say.\u201cThere was no class system there. There was no king or nobility. No, there are countries, but at least where I lived, a person called \u2018president\u2019 ruled the country, not a king. They were hand-picked by people once every few years.\u201d\u201cWhat do you share in your degradation when you lose your identity? Don\u2019t you share the distinction?\u201d\u201cSimilar to this country, money was used to scrutinize the world. Those who accumulated wealth lived with power. And, unlike Eris, I was poor and ordinary in that world.\u201dHe closed his eyes and asked me.\u201cDid you have any family?\u201d\u201cThere was. Mother, father, younger brother. It was like this in my family. I hated it because it was all messy\u2026 Now that I think about it, I think they were quite harmonious and friendly.\u201d\u201cDo you mind if I ask you why you didn\u2019t like them?\u201d\u201cAt that time, I thought I was being discriminated against. My parents tried to give my brother something better than me.\u201dThen I suddenly stopped talking and corrected myself.\u201cNo, I thought I was discriminated against. Even if it wasn\u2019t my parents, my parents\u2019 close friends or relatives\u2026 Ah, I didn\u2019t stop them, so maybe my parents thought the same thing.\u201dThey gave praise to my brother when he cooked pancakes or did housework, but if I didn\u2019t, I was considered \u2018spoiled\u2019. Of course, I didn\u2019t like the tone that an older sister should do it. So I deliberately passed on my age to my younger brother.They used to tease me about what I would do with the housework when I got married, but I thought it was something to think about then.That\u2019s why I ran away.TL/rant: this is my most favourite chapter. I always wanted a plot where the MC shares about the earth and about the people of earth to the male lead. I have read a similar plot (scene) in these novels/manhwa.1. Pharaoh\u2019s Concubine 2.

I believed I was being discriminated against because I was a bad child.\u201dMy parents always told me about our difficult circumstances. They probably didn\u2019t mean to tell me that on purpose expecting me to solve or deal with them, but at the same time, I believed I had no choice but to take them on.Because I was poor, I grew up earlier than others. Maybe I didn\u2019t even know at the time if I was looking to be praised or not. Because the more mature I became, the more proud my parents were of me.So, even when my parents were more generous to my younger brother, I endured it because I thought it would have been easier for my younger brother to do what I asked him to do because of our family circumstances.Yet finally, I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer with the belief that discrimination was normal because my younger brother was \u2018kinder\u2019 to my parents.Then what is the standard for \u2018being kind\u2019?\u201cThere is no child in this world who deserves to be discriminated against. I won\u2019t forgive my parents\u2026.. but you know what? Even if you don\u2019t want to forgive, even if you hate it and resent it, I think you can miss it.\u201dThere is one thing I am certain of after repeatedly attempting suicide over and over again. I still love my family. To the extent that the memories of the good things they did to me come to mind first.\u201cI\u2019m going to meet them again and ask them. Why did you do that?\u201dSomehow, I felt at ease. After I let go of my troubled and shaking heart, my mind suddenly became clear. looked straight into Anakin\u2019s eyes and smiled as if he was part of my family.\u201cI\u2019m going back to ask.\u201dAnakin looked at me and then nodded as if he understood. He became thoughtful, not asking any further questions. We fell into silence again.It didn\u2019t feel awkward anymore.By the time we arrived in Rundol, the bright morning sun had already risen. We checked in at the cleanest and nicest accommodation close by.Because we were dressed in relatively modest attire, and also because no one in the countryside knew Eris\u2019s face, the innkeeper mistook us for the newlyweds. The innkeeper barely stopped trying to push us into a single room.Since I had been riding a carriage all night, my body was sore. I told Anakin to relax, and then asked the innkeeper to deliver water because I wanted a bath.Not long after, I heard a knock on the door. When opened the door to let him in, a child half my height came, moaning and carrying a wooden bucket of warm water. Seeing him sweat profusely, I felt sorry for him.Even in the city where Eris\u2019s mansion was located, water supply facilities were developed, and not only nobles but also wealthy commoners lived with facilities similar to modern bathrooms.Whether it is in Korea or here, it seems that it\u2019s the same to develop mainly in the capital. I gave the child two silver coins for trouble and asked,\u201cIt\u2019s my first time in Rundol, do you know any attractions?\u201d (T/N: tourist sites)\u201cOh, yes, of course! I\u2019ve lived here since I was born, and I know them very well! You know that Rundol is famous for its lake, right? Some people come to see the lake because it\u2019s deeper and more beautiful than the ocean! If you ask the front desk, they\u2019ll lend you a boat!\u201dExcited, the child continued and explained there\u2019s a night market as well as other interesting sites in the village. I handed another coin to the child, who then left quickly, and locked the door. The hot water had cooled down moderately, so warm water wrapped around me pleasantly.It\u2019s been a long time since I could bathe by myself. When I was in the mansion, the maids made a fuss and gave me a bath even though I said I\u2019d wanted to bathe alone. To be honest, it was comfortable. They washed my hair, dried it\u2026\u2026 I wanted to live like this in Korea if I had money.My mind was filled with simple thoughts, making me laugh. I bubbled up to wash my body. Wash clean, get dressed, dry my hair, pull the string back and send the child out with the wooden barrel. I fell asleep lying on the bed snuggling into the blanket.By the time I opened my eyes again, the sun had set. I could see a sliver of light shining through the window. It must be the night market that the child told me earlier.Hmm\u2026\u2026\u2026 I quietly called Anakin.Then I counted to the number three in my mind,One, two, three.\u201cDid you call me?\u201dYes, I was pleased and smiled as I spoke to Anakin beyond the door.\u201cI\u2019m going to see the night market. Get ready.\u201dSince birth, Hubris had been living his life with the need to always hold onto something. The first was his mother\u2019s umbilical cord, then the hem of the priests\u2019 robes, and by the time he realized logic, he had grasped the truth created by God.The reason why he had no choice but to live holding on to something was because his life was always on the edge of a precipice. A life that can always be saved right before the crash. Hubris\u2019s life was worse than that precipice.Since his father was never in his life, it was natural for him to believe that there was no such thing as a father. One day, when he realized that all families have a \u2018father\u2019, Hubris asked his mother who his \u2018father\u2019 is.His mother slapped him as soon as she heard the question. It was the first time she laid hands on him. His mother seemed more surprised than Hubris that she hit him.But she didn\u2019t apologize. Instead, she just reminded him over and over to never ask about his father again.So the first taboo was born.Hubris occasionally looked in the mirror, trying to find traces of his father, but it was in vain.Hubris closely resembled his mother, who was an exotic dancer. Dark skin, even darker hair than Eris\u2019s, and lips that were a little thicker than others\u2019.When they walked out on the street, everyone would recognize Hubris. It came back to haunt him from time to time. No, actually, very often.Slowly, little by little, his mother started to lose her mind. She was very young when she gave birth to Hubris. Giving up a promising career and life as a dancer after his birth.While pregnant, she feared that if she was discovered by the marquis, she would lose her child. So she ran away.Running way was not easy. Her original troupe and employer sent a man to pursue her relentlessly.To avoid capture, she earned her travel expenses by begging on the bare floor, and finally managed to reach the country temple in full bloom. She prayed that she could live as a temple servant for the rest of her life after giving birth to the child.Originally, it was not allowed. Because Hubris\u2019s mother was a pagan.But it was the merciful Divine Matteus who knelt at her feet. He put a veil on her and sprinkled holy water to wash away all her sins. So the mother was able to live as a temple servant.By giving up a promising future as a dancer, she had to start all over from the beginning again. A person who had learned only singing and dancing. She was clumsy at first when she started to learn how to clean and do laundry.Delicate hands used to being soft and adored with sparkling accessories gradually became rough and callous. Her youthful and smooth face started to form wrinkles. The brightness of her youth became marred in fatigue and irritability that later shifted to her son, Hubris.There didn\u2019t need to be a justification for her later actions. Because the only person in the temple who was weaker than her, was Hubris.She begged Hubris to die. She blamed Hubris as to why her life became like this. Sometimes she didn\u2019t just say she wanted to die, but she actually tried to kill herself.At first, Hubris was so shocked that he cried his eyes out. He started to have nightmares about his mother\u2019s death, so he stayed up all night to protect her, afraid she would try to take her life again.At some point, Hubris realized that his mother could control her depression to the extent that was notsuicidal. What she needed was constant attention and affection.Thirsty for affection, she would constantly throw herself off a cliff for attention. Hubris could not blame his mother for her behavior.However, he thought that his mother should not have given birth to him.Why she didn\u2019t give up on him even though she knew this would happen, Hubris still doesn\u2019t know why. Maybe it was because of the timing of entering the temple, maybe she loved his father, or maybe she needed to be loved so much.But there were many things in the world that affection alone could not solve. Hubris gradually became dulled by his mother\u2019s body and mind withering away.Hubris begged at the foot of the High Priest Metheus, who was about to leave for the capital, to relieve him of his mother\u2019s burden.\u2018Let me leave with you, I want to be a priest.Hubris had divine power and a talent as a priest. No, it was because he was at the breaking point, that Metheus willingly allowed Hubris to accompany him.Hubris told his mother that he would be leaving the room and temple where he had lived since he was born.Thinking about it now, maybe it was because he wanted to run away from his mother. He was tired,Hubris spent their last night together sleeping by his mother\u2019s side. Hubris\u2019s mother patted the hand of hergrown-up son for a while. When Hubris opened his eyes, he discovered his mother\u2019s cold body.After the funeral, Hubris sat alone at the end of the dance. He regretted, wishing he had grabbed her just one more time. On the day he was sent out into the world, the whole universe expanded outHubris discovered that he liked sweet things that didn\u2019t go well with his appearance. To him, sweets were the only pleasure allowed among the many restrictions of the priesthood. However, because of the gaze of others\u2019 expectations of him, he would always ask for his sweets to be packaged from the bakery and eat at it separately alone.That day was also such a day. It was a time of waiting in line at a busy bakery and waiting for the joy to come.As it was a famous bakery, there were many people there that day. Even though the capital is large, due to the crowd, he would be jostled here and there by people rushing to retrieve their wrapped up sweets,Someone pushed a person in front.When the staggering lady fell into his arms and she looked up at him, Hubris could not help but doubt his eyes.At first he thought she was just an illusion. Because it was unbelievable. A vivid purple with the fluttering yellow souls. She was so foreign that he grabbed her and asked.\u201cWho are you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She raised her chin in an expression of defiance and arrogance.\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange for the High Priest to focus on an unmarried noble woman?\u201d\u201c\u2026..What I\u2019m focused on isn\u2019t your status.\u201d\u201cNot my status?\u201dHubris became silent. The color of her soul was still purple, but how can he prove it? People see her as a lady of high stature and social standing in current aristocratic circles.Whether she knew he was hesitating or not, she was trying to push Hubris away.When he came to his senses, she had already disappeared. He couldn\u2019t sleep all night because he was bothered by the purple spirit that seemed to be torn. In his dream, his mother appeared, crying, saying it was his fault.When they first met, he didn\u2019t even know her identity It wasn\u2019t until later when he gave her description to an apprentice priest that he discovered who she was,Eris Mis\u00e9rian. The marquis\u2019s sole daughter and crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. The apprentice priest said Lady Mis\u00e9rian has a scary personality and added that he was fortunate that he was not slapped on the face for defamation.\u201cAck!\u201dHe thought they might meet one day while going back and forth from the palace, but he didn\u2019t expect it to come so soon. Her soul\u2019s color was still purple even when her feet collapsed beneath and tears were falling down her face.At the time, he couldn\u2019t even question her about what he saw, so he tried to leave after treating her ankle, yet Lady Mis\u00e9rian grabbed him.\u201cWho do I look like?\u201dThe shimmering purple spirit was no illusion. Inside Lady Mis\u00e9ran was a stranger who had only been written in ancient books.She asked Hubris, with a hopeful voice, if there was some way for her to go back. As soon as he heard it, several books he had read thus far went through his head, but unfortunately he recalled that no stranger had left alive.H\u00fcbris hesitated even though he could have answered, her right away. For some reason, he didn\u2019t want to give the stranger a false hope. The truth eventually spewed out at her urging. Lady Mis\u00e9rian laughed and denied it.\u201cIf there was no way out of this life, how would I ever have come into this world alive, right? There must be a way, but you don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cMy lady\u2026..\u201dShaking pupils, rapid breathing, a broken soul. Hubris saw a vision of his mother overlaid with hers. His mother\u2019s soul was always red, bruised and torn.\u201cPlease find it. Since you are the High Priest, if you go back to the temple, you can find the material, right? So -.\u201d\u201cMy lady! Listen to me.\u201dScared of her collapsing at any moment, Hubris grabbed her arms. He started to explain the law of life, so that she could understand it bit by bit. He tried to convince her.\u201cAccept fate and live her life instead.\u201dHubris wasn\u2019t sure what kind of expression he was making. He didn\u2019t know how desperate she was. Hubris slowly lifted her up from her collapsed position. Then he held onto her as if she was going to collapse again, and she somehow glanced up at Hubris with a determined look.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf that is how the law of life works, then I\u2019ll leave even if I must die.\u201dHubris could not understand this. Why are they so willing to give up their God-given life? Is it because they couldn\u2019t stand the brief uncertainty and pain of the moment, so they went on a path that they would regret.As if all the painful scenes were just an act, she said in a firm and confident manner.\u201cMy life was given to me by my parents, not by God. If you weren\u2019t conceived by the Holy Spirit, so wouldyou.\u201dHer words somehow stabbed Hubris in the chest.The next place they met was at the temple. Her body that could not escape exhaustion was thin when she came with her escort.Hubris rubbed her wrinkled brow and gave her divinity. As if she had woken up a bit, she looked at him with a slightly sullen expression. His hand gesture was covered with a veil.According to the procedure, the holy water in the brass bowl should be slowly poured. When he turned over the wet veil, a pale, thin face appeared.Now it was time to apply the perfume.But Hubris\u2019s hand stopped. It was only then that he saw her face for the first time, as he had only seen a purple soul until now. Beautiful.Oh, she opened her eyes. These are the eyes that shortened the time of early summer. The morning sun glimmered in her bluish green eyes. At those fluttering eyes, Hubris stopped breathing.It was only when she looked at him with a puzzled expression that he realized he was openly staring at Lady Mis\u00e9rian. Frantically, he wiped Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s eyes as she pointed it out to him.\u201cSir, High Priest.\u201dAh.Hubris felt his earlobes burning with shame.He poured the perfume quickly on his hand and touched both eyes again with trembling fingers. Protect.So that both eyes don\u2019t contain evil. Now it was the lip\u2019s turn to receive a blessing.Yet when it was the lips turn\u2026\u2026\u201cWhy am I hesitating?\u2019 Hubris wanted to cry. Lady Mis\u00e9rian, who was unable to see, stamped her lips on his finger, pressing them.Even after everything was over and she left, Hubris still stood there stunned. Trying to find the reasons for his hesitation.If you had to pick the person who is most precious to Hubris, he would definitely say that it was his mother, However, if he had to decide between his mother and Priest Metheus\u2019s lives, well, he might pick Priest Metheus.Because Metheus is a person who practices the universal good of mankind.Due to the mercy of Priest Metheus, he was able to be born, and furthermore, Hubris realized that he had a future other than begging.It was also Metheus who supported Hubris, after he was shocked by his mother\u2019s death. He manually showed him how to do things one by one, all for Hubris, who doesn\u2019t know anything.It was common thought to return his mother\u2019s body to her original hometown, but with Priest Metheus\u2019s consideration, they held his mother\u2019s funeral there.In other words, Metheus was the person who filled all the voids in Hubris. He was a father, a teacher, and a close friend. So, when he heard that Metheus was seriously ill, his eyes widened in shock.Was it not Metheus who has been guiding Hubris and correcting him not too long ago? Yet why was Metheus in a critical condition now. As soon as Hubris heard the story, he immediately prepared to leave for the Boniteo region.He couldn\u2019t make up his mind. Hubris suddenly lost his mother, so Metheus was his last remaining family member. He was not yet ready to let another person he loved go away.He packed a suitcase and with his coat in one hand, he went out. The new official, who heard the news, gave him some advice.\u201cIf you have to go quickly, take the magic train. It will arrive faster than the carriage.\u201d\u201cA magic train?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t you know? It became famous because Lady Mis\u00e9rian rode it to the Rundol region\u2026 It\u2019s like a long carriage that moves with magic engineering as fuel. It doesn\u2019t use horses, so there\u2019s no need to stop. I heard there are accommodations and restaurants inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.I see. Thank you for your advice. Please take care of the temple.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the temple. Bless you, as you go on your way.\u201dWhen Hubris entered the noisy station and stood anxiously at the ticket office, the staff made a troubled face.\u201cUm, High Priest. Originally, we would provide you with first class seats, but this train is strictly by reservation system\u2026. Unfortunately, it\u2019s already fully booked, so there\u2019s only one second class seat left, will you be okay with this?\u201d\u201cThe seat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cI see. Then you can present the second class train ticket to Boniteo to the flight attendant.\u201dAfter the staff stamped and issued the tickets, he hurriedly picked up his luggage and boarded the train. After all, since he was the Hubris who usually leads a frugal life, the second class was quite luxurious.After some time had passed and by the time he was ready to leave, he heard a knock on the door. Before he could even answer the knock, the door unlocked and she shot into his life once again.With a playful smile on her lips, Lady Mis\u00e9rian closed the door and entered the compartment. He knew that she had a gorgeous appearance, but when she was determined and radiated that splendor, she overwhelmed his eyes.Even when dressed like a peasant from the streets her attire was nothing short of a masterpiece of loveliness.\u201cThe\u2026.. looks like\u2026\u2026 what the\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs this outfit more important than the reason I visited you?\u201dHe closed his mouth in shame. The guilt over having imagined such a thing even for a moment, was an added bonus. He looked silently to find out her intentions as she sat across his seat and lightly crossed her legs.\u201cI have to get off soon anyway, but my feet hurt, so I\u2019ll sit down. All right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What do you mean you\u2019re getting off?\u201d\u201cI want to meet Priest Metheus. Take me with you.\u201dShe always speaks arrogantly. As if she had no choice but to say that Hubris won\u2019t listen to her request.When Lady Mis\u00e9rian naturally folded her arms, Hubris thought his heart was going to explode. Every time he struggled, her grip on him grew stronger. Sweat was dripping from his hands, and his throat was dry.\u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d\u201cWell, yes, if you let go of this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat color is my soul?\u201d\u201cThe color of the lady\u2019s soul?\u201dLady Mis\u00e9rian didn\u2019t give him a single glance after leaving the compartment.Despite all the unpleasant glances at her, she just looked straight in front of her.\u201cPurple. The color of the lady\u2019s soul is purple.\u201d\u201cIs it purple?\u201dOh, and then he made eye contact with her. The corners of her mouth gently drew a line, but her eyes were infinitely soft.\u201cThat\u2019s great. Of all the colors, I hate purple the most.\u201dHis heart felt tortured. How does it feel to truly curse, life?Since then, Hubris has been sitting on thorns. He kept looking at her. Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s wounded soul kept overlapping with his mother\u2019s.When he asked her why she was looking at him because he felt the gaze, her half-hearted insinuation became rather poisonous. You want me to tear it apart again?He couldn\u2019t understand how she could easily discuss tearing her soul so casually.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 28Don\u2019t Pity MeThe escort\u2019s blade was held to his neck as Hubris started to hold out his hand. He didn\u2019t care. Her mocking voice came quickly.\u201cWhy, because it\u2019s a God-given life?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. My lady\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat? The very existence itself is precious\u2026\u2026? What is so precious about my existence?\u201dHubris hesitated to answer. Because to him, life was all \u201cequal\u201d, regardless of one\u2019s standing.He couldn\u2019t tell the lady in front of him that it was just as precious as the wild grass on the side of the road. Because it was logic that ordinary people wouldn\u2019t understand.But what she took for his silence Lady Mis\u00e9rian stabbed him pointedly.Lady Mis\u00e9rian took his silence differently and jabbed him pointedly.\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to hear that someone you know is dead. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cAre you afraid that I would blame you? I might want to live if you held me once\u2026\u2026 like this kind of thing?\u201dWith those words, the memory of his dead mother\u2019s body who took poison made him tremble. He suddenly hated the woman in front of him who spoke harshly without knowing anything.As High Priest, he saved the lives of thousands of people. Those who attempted suicide said over and over again that they must have made the wrong choice when they came back to life in his hands, and thanked him for saving their life.Since then, Hubris has thought about it every night. He thought if only he had found his mother sooner, he could have saved her, and that she might be regretting her own choice.In an uncomfortably venomous tone, Hubris replied that he was confident she would not regret it. His neat nails dug into his palms. And his despair swelled quietly.\u201cYou know what? A person, no matter how much they want to die, you can\u2019t cheer them up when they are so depressed.\u201dThe casual confession imbued the scent of blood. She was feeling suffocated. Lady Mis\u00e9rian was about to break, so he couldn\u2019t let go of her hand even though blood was flowing from his palm. A terrifying feeling of foreboding gripped him.\u201cShould I live my life well now because God has helped me? You\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m such a fool that I can\u2019t even die properly and fail. Every time\u2026\u2026 If I repeat it, both regret and fear fade away. No, no\u2026\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m just whittling away little by little.\u201dMaybe he can\u2019t save her.\u201cWhy do you have that look on your face? Are you afraid? You think I\u2019m gonna die right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, I\u2019m afraid.\u201dLike in the case of his mother, Hubris would be helpless to save another woman. Unlike him who was grief-stricken, Lady Mis\u00e9rian was smiling gently. Like a person waiting for the day.When Lady Mis\u00e9rian discovered him seeing her talking to the mirror with the witch, his first reaction was to hide. It was clear that she would be burned at the stake if others found out. Then there was anger over why an evil witch was involved.It was obvious that Lady Mis\u00e9rian didn\u2019t know how dangerous the witch was. Maybe the conniving witch reached out to her who didn\u2019t know what to do. He thought he should tell her right away and stop it, but before he knew it, the cold black blade of a knife touched his neck. A low, warning echoed in his ears as he closed his mouth to stifle his scream.\u201cBe quiet. Master is having an important conversation.\u201dHubris twisted his body back and forth to resist, but the difference in physical strength between a priest and a knight was huge. Unable to move, as her escort knight, who was always walking behind her, held him firmly. Then a scream was heard from the lake shore.\u201cAnswer me! Why me! Why! Why must it be me! Some people must have dreamed of something like this! But why must it be me! Why! Why the hell!\u201dLady Mis\u00e9rian is screaming. She should be comforted right now, but the knight did not release his strength from the hand that held onto Hubris\u2019s shoulder.\u2018It was only when Lady Mis\u00e9rian finally threw the mirror into the lake that the knight dragged him before her like a beast, without removing the sword, from his neck.\u201cYou\u2026 were you in communion with a witch?Hubris wanted her to deny it. Saying she didn\u2019t know, that she was deceived herself, that she won\u2019t see her again, or words asking for forgiveness\u2026 But she only smiled coldly.\u201cAre you going to file a complaint with the Vatican? It\u2019s all right. That\u2019s what I was hoping for. I can\u2019t die if I was stabbed, but if I was burned at the stake\u2026.. Go ahead and accuse me.\u201dNo, that\u2019s not what he was hoping for. Lady Mis\u00e9rian, who doesn\u2019t know his good intentions, was heartless, and Hubris snapped.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian!\u201d\u201cAnakin, release High Priest Hubris. Only then will he be able to accuse me.\u201dAs soon as her escort knight threw him in front of her, she approached him, drew a sword, and threw it in front of him.\u201cKill me with that sword. The woman who has a connection with the witch is also a witch? Why don\u2019t you kill me off after being so cruel? Is my blood dirty?\u201dHubris thought he was quite disciplined to hear harsh words. He thought he could listen as well as he didwhen he first heard it from his mother. But her sadness ended up burning up Hubris\u2019s throat.He never expected to be recognized by everyone. Nor did he want everyone to like him. If any, it would have been a small expectation. Yet he couldn\u2019t believe the only two women he ever wanted to be liked by, were rejecting him.She smiled at him like someone caught up green and beautiful eyes.\u201cHigh Priest, it\u2019s not a difficult request. Just keep pretending that you don\u2019t know me like you do now. The fact that I\u2019m a stranger\u2026 The fact that I\u2019m in communication with a witch\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t pretend not to know. He didn\u2019t want to repeat the same tragedy that night.\u201cI\u2019m about to die anyway. But I promise. I won\u2019t die in front of you, and I won\u2019t show up in front of you when I\u2019m a ghost.\u201d\u201cWhy, why do you talk like that? Your sadness is painful. It\u2019s too much.\u201dHubris\u2019s mind was in agony. Every time he blinked, the vision of his dead mother and Lady Mis\u00e9rian overlapped. He felt the nausea begin to bile up in his throat.\u201c\u2026\u2026No, no. What can I do? I want to ask forgiveness for your anger\u2026\u2026. So, so please\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t die?\u201dLive. There are days when he regrets not being able to say that word to his mother. Live\u2026\u2026.In the end, tears that could not be contained flowed down both cheeks. He wanted her to need him. He said that if she did anything wrong, he would forgive her for anything she did, so please don\u2019t give up on her life.Hubris looked up at her with his hopes. Her white, beautiful hand wiped away his tears. A soft smile under the moonlight. During the day, the woman in her prostitute\u2019s clothes changed her form in an instant to the Holy Mother.Hubris has always been holding onto something since he was born. First it was the mother\u2019s umbilical cord, then it was the hem of the priest\u2019s robe, and when he realized the reason, he held the truth created by God in his hand.He prayed to God. This time he asked God to let him hold this woman\u2019s hand. He begged in his heart for a chance to save her from her death.\u201cDon\u2019t pity me. It\u2019s annoying.\u201dThat was the end. The world flickered.I originally liked the night market. The night is calm, but I like the unusual atmosphere made up of people\u2019s noises and lights. So when I heard that the night market was opening, I had to go there.The problem was the clothes. When I got off the train, I threw away all my luggage, and all I had left was the black dress I was wearing, with the exception of the red dress I brought to disguise as a prostitute,Black clothes were usually worn at funerals, so there was a risk that they would be visible if they were wornon a regular basis. Even though I have a striking appearance, if even the clothes stand out, it\u2019s like informing the neighborhood that I\u2019m an aristocratic lady with a story.So I paid the girl I saw at the inn during the day and asked her to buy clothes that would suit the common people.The inn girl measured my body with an anxious face wondering if she couldn\u2019t even touch my body and then bought some clean, non-sparkling cotton clothes, Contrary to my worries, the clothes fit me perfectlyI\u2019ll have to go buy some sweets at the night market later and give it to her to compliment her skills,Walking out the door in a white and beige tunic dress, I saw Anakin was waiting at the door like a loyal dog, causing me to sigh.\u201c\u2026Anakin, change your clothes and come.\u201dIf he wears armor, no matter how I wear casual clothes like a commoner, I\u2019ll look like a lady.Although it is not a countryside with only fields and forests like Bonito, the Randol region was no different from the capital city. I wondered, is it close to a resort city where people come to enjoy the lake and nature?Therefore, the night market was more simple and clunky than fanciful.You have to hold something in your mouth to see a night market! I first turned to the area that sells food. As expected, there were many kinds that were simply grilled over charcoal.At first, I didn\u2019t want to eat chicken because it was common, and was afraid that eating frog would get me a stomachache, so I decided to eat the most normal sausage. But they all look similar on the surface. I stood in front of the store to ask the owner in a friendly way.\u201cHello. How much is a sausage?\u201d\u201cMadam! A sausage this big is only three echromi a piece! You won\u2019t regret it.\u201d3 echrom is 3 fairy tales. If I had to compare it to Korea, it was about 1,500 won? But for that price, the sausage was really thick and shiny. I swallowed my saliva and asked.\u201cDoes it all taste the same?\u201d\u201cNo! They have a variety of flavors from raw meat to cheese and spices. They\u2019re all the same price.\u201dDo I want to eat meat with spices or just meat? After thinking about it, I asked if I could buy one for Anakin, who was standing in the back looking confused.\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cOh ho! What a nice lady! Are you two married? Since you\u2019re both feeling awkward, you must be newlyweds.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 29Satire PlayGrinning, I answered, pinching the sides of Anakin, who was trying to refute it.\u201cYes, actually, it\u2019s our honeymoon. He is not that awkward, but I guess he is a little shy in front of people he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAh hah! A groom! I\u2019ve met a lot of couples who travel here, but I\u2019ve never seen a wife as pretty as this lady! You must have saved a country in your past life! Since I feel like it! If you buy two, I\u2019ll give you a discount of 5 echromes!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019d like ones with meat and spices, please.\u201dAs the owner quickly picked out the best cooked sausages to jab skewers into, he checked to see if they were hot and ready. When I tried to pay, the owner shook his head and winked.\u201cA beautiful lady is the best. I also see that you are kind.\u201dUnable to say anything, I scrunch my nose. Walking along the streets that followed, I took a bite of the meat flavor with excitement. Wow, it\u2019s delicious, it\u2019s good! It was such a wonderful taste that my body trembled automatically.The taste of handmade sausages is different from the cheap frank sausages we used to eat in Korea\u2026.! It was the best because you could smell the spices. It would have been even more perfect with mustard sauce.At first, I was curious about the taste of the spices so I quickly put the meat stick in Anakin\u2019s mouth. Spices\u2026 It tasted like a variety of them but what was the flavor?Actually, I liked Indian curry spices as well as coriander, which most Koreans\u2019 dislike. Yet as soon as I took a bite of the meat in anticipation, I immediately noticed that my eyes were glistening.This is\u2026 chili pepper! I almost cried at the taste of ddangcho I hadn\u2019t tasted for such a long time. I couldn\u2019t believe that I could smell my hometown in unexpected places.Suddenly while eating, I began to crave beer. While looking around, I saw there was a place that sold something that looked similar to alcohol and rushed over there.\u201cIs that alcohol?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a grain wine made from local grains! It\u2019s savory and delicious. Would you like one?\u201d\u201cTwo, please.\u201dThe owner filled the rough wooden mugs with alcohol. I turned around and winked at Anakin. He came, slightly running, held the sausage in his hand in his mouth, and held a wooden mug in both hands.There was a loud noise coming from far away. They must be performing a play. I\u2019ve only heard of thisoutdoor play, so I really wanted to see it. Leading an awkward Anakin, I found a space to sit halfway through.Soon a clown came out and introduced a rough plot in an exaggerated voice about the play. A clown entered the stage and introduced, in an exaggerated voice, the rough plot of the play.\u201cToday our story is about a family tragedy. It\u2019s a silly story where a father falls for evil tricks which makes him doubt his son, doubt his wife, and ends up killing his son with his own hands. A wicked witch who could turn back time, who will be decapitated for treason\u2026..\u201dI understood the gist of it. It\u2019s a satire on the imperial family. Originally, satirical dramas contain more facts. With anticipation, I ate the sausage and drank heavilyLooking at his sword in the middle of the temple, the young man has a sad expression on his face. He grazes the sword\u2019s handle with his fingertips, as the prince cannot easily pull out the sword. He circled his hand around the sword and time seemed to slow down just a little.\u201cI am indifferent. Although I have been faithfully living as a servant of God and of the nation, they easily forsake me. Even though the body is tainted with shame by the slanders on earth, God knows the truth. He knows my soul is noble. I know this better than anyone, so I am not afraid of death, except that I am afraid that the wicked will flood this land. My mother was crying. Don\u2019t shed any tears! Ah, my unnamed brother in the womb, now you must defend this country.\u201dAfter the long monologue, the prince pulled out his sword with a determined expression.\u201cOne day, the truth will be revealed that I never coveted your throne. No matter how reckless I shout, a unique crowd will cover their eyes and ears, and they cannot hear the truth! But I am not going to be amicable. Father if you want me to kill myself\u2026\u201dAt this time, you can hear the queen crying behind the curtain.\u201cMy dear child, this mother knows better than anyone that you are innocent. Run away. Put down that sword and run away! Though we may never meet in this life again, we will be closer than the crossing of the river in the underworld. We will be under the same moon no matter where you are. Don\u2019t you want to be with your mother? Stop! Are you going to hurt your mother too!\u201dBut the prince had already stabbed the sword into his heart and collapsed. The queen, who came in late, hugged the prince, shedding tears as she screamed at him. Then she shouted.\u201cRevenge!\u201dAs if time went back after the first act, the prince is somehow alive and appears again. He is kneeling on his knees at the foot of the king. The king gives a scolding.\u201cI have raised and cherished you more than anything in the world and yet you strike cruelly at the hand that feeds you. I thought you were a precious child but in fact, you are a snake playing along. Looking for the chance to cut my throat. God is heartless!\u201dThe prince, kneeling down, appealed pitifully\u201cMerciful, wise and righteous king of this land. As my father, king, and judge who has breathed life to me on this earth, I have never had such a mind. Who dares say such venomous words in father\u2019s ear?\u201dThen the prince suddenly raises his head and stares at the count standing next to the king. Outraged, he charged at him.\u201cIt\u2019s you, you murderer, you villain, you filthy little pig thief!\u201d\u201cOof\u201d\u201cVillain! Have you lost your mind! How dare a sinner try to harm my servant? Are you not the one who wears my son\u2019s robe? The sins of betrayal cannot be washed away by the fires of hell.\u201dWhile the prince was held by knights, the count took a package out of his arms and offered it to the king.\u201cThis is proof that the Queen and the Prince were in communication and conspired against you.\u201dThere are documents with the names of the prince and queen written on them, contracts to purchase soldiers, and so on. The prince widens his eyes and looks at them. Suddenly, his neck was strained as he struggled and shouted.\u201cYou fiend! That is all lies. All are I blatant lies! Let go! He is the one who dares insult me and my mother! He must be decapitated and there will be no shame in front of God. Can\u2019t you let go!\u201d\u201cGo and bring her!\u201dAt the command of the count, a knight brings a person dressed in shabby clothes. The person looks around frantically as he is dragged cowering in front of the king.\u201cOhhh! The humble dare to see the most honorable king on earth.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell the truth, your peculiar tongue will be cut off.\u201d\u201cOh King, the benevolent father of this land! It is a waste of my life to die, though it has been said since ancient times, more cruel than death is the pestilence of poverty. I will not make any excuses because I have entered the path of sin on my own two feet. Please behead me.\u201dThe prince raises his voice even more at the man\u2019s testimony.\u201cTell me the truth! Aren\u2019t you afraid of God for perjury!\u201d\u201cEvidence and witnesses of conspiring treason have come out! If you are so innocent, what kind of testimony do you have!\u201d\u201cI have absolutely no intention of betraying my father! Don\u2019t fall for the trick! If these words are false, then God will strike a thunderbolt over my head immediately.\u201dAt this time, \u2018Flash!\u2019 Along with the lights that rumble, the sound of thunder echoing the earth is heard. The prince\u2019s face turns pale. The king\u2019s face hardened. The knights take the prince away.\u201cKeep the prince in the spire and do not give him even a sip of water.\u201d\u201cFather, father!\u201d\u201cThe queen\u2026 she still has a royal descendant in her belly. I recommend you hold your judgement for a while.\u201dThe heartless king leaves and soon the third act begins.The queen and prince are distributing food to beggars. When both leave, she looks at the dreary surroundings and says with a lamentable face,\u201cHow horrible! So many people are suffering from cold and hunger\u2026\u2026 They may hold out for some time with the food we have now given away, but this will not last long. Heaven is indifferent too. What the hell should I do?\u201d\u201cMother, isn\u2019t it the duty of a royal to rescue those who have been abandoned by heaven? Adults can earn a living right now, but I\u2019m more worried about the children. If they learn, they will be able to escape from the same poverty of their parents, but their parents only make them beg.\u201dThe queen and the prince sigh, and from far away, a, reversed count walks. He greets the queen and the prince, looks around, and whispers.\u201cI was going to build an orphanage and a school around here as part of a guest project, but it didn\u2019t happen because I didn\u2019t have enough donations. Why don\u2019t you pay me a little bit of your royal money? We\u2019re almost ready to start construction, so we can build it as soon as we buy the workers with that money.\u201dBoth the queen and the prince clapped their hands in joy at the count\u2019s suggestion.\u201cGood idea! Come to my palace and I\u2019ll give you a draft immediately, we will be generous. What\u2019s the use of taking it from the people and giving it back to the people? The Count seems to be more knowledgeable about the country than we are, so please take care of it. Tell us whatever you need.\u201d\u201cIs there any doubt.\u201d\u201cIt is heartbreaking that the illiteracy rate of the general public was so high. A man who can read will have a lot of resentment from being blackmailed. How long does it take to teach children so that they can grow up and teach others!\u201dThe prince, who spoke vigorously, supports the queen, who stumbles a little. The queen smiles and reassures the prince.\u201cI was feeling saddened because I\u2019ve given out a little food. Now that we\u2019ve solved our worries, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYes, mother.\u201dThe queen and the prince disappear and a masked man appears in the back alley. The count instructs the man with an insidious face.\u201cYou will need to lie. Even though you will die, I will protect your family.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026 let me buy a poor mage engineer. It might be necessary.\u201dThe masked man nods his head and disappears into the darkness again. Act 3 ends with the count walking away with a cunning smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Send an assassin!?\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, so dull. If we use our hands, it will be considered treason! It is the king himself who has to destroy his son so that there will be no consequences to us.\u201d\u201cEveryone, please be quiet. It seems that our Count has a secret plan.\u201dWhen the commotion subsided and everyone\u2019s eyes turned to him, the count shrugged and continued.\u201cThey are usually interested in saving the poor, so they are offering money and buying people to help reach the poor, saying they need them to save the people. We switch the funds to hiring a secret military personnel for overthrowing the king and they will be charged for treason!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cThe King is a heartless man, and no matter how much he loves the Prince, if he\u2019s after his life, the prince will be cut into pieces.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of all the loyalists we don\u2019t want to see!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201dThe laughter of the nobles and the clinking of the glasses made a loud noise.Act 5 begins. Unlike the previous setting, the new atmosphere is peaceful and soft. The king, queen, and prince are gathered in one place.\u201cIt is a bright and sunny day.\u201d\u201cIt has been awhile since we have seen a day so grand. It seems to bless our harmonious meal.\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s a good day here, we can\u2019t leave out the good news.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth is it that makes you so happy?\u201d\u201cWould you like to guess? Son, give your answer aswell.\u201dThe king and the prince contemplate for a long time.\u201cForgive me for being at a loss, my Queen.\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201dHow can one lead a country so well if one doesn\u2019t have patience for things like this? Things don\u2019t get solved at once, you have to wait and see how things go\u2026.The king and prince, smile bashfully. While looking at the shape of the queen, she smiles shyly and touches her belly.\u201cThe prince\u2019s brother is in it?\u201d\u201cOh, come here. My love, my rain! Underneath your thick clothes, there was something prettier than the moon in the sky! Let me hug the child and see. Can hear the child\u2019s heartbeat if I put my ear to it? Don\u2019t you have a cloud on your feet! Even though you are pregnant, the doctors fooled me like crazy!\u201d\u201cIt was because I wanted to tell you in person, so I asked him to keep it a secret. I can\u2019t tell you how much my mouth was itching to say it right away. Son, come to me too. Shouldn\u2019t you put your hand on your mother\u2019s belly and say hello to your new sibling!\u201dThe king and the prince put their ears on the queen\u2019s belly side by side. Both are smiling happily.\u201cWhen this child is born, he can hold the Prince\u2019s hand, who was always alone and lonely, it\u2019s only now that they\u2019re a match. There are many people who live, their whole lives without a child, but now that I have two, it\u2019s truly an unprecedented blessing. To the sun in the sky, you are sending us a warm light as if tobless us! Let\u2019s all swear by the sun that we will not let go of our hand holding each other like this and we will live together trusting each other. It\u2019s a beautiful day. Oh, what a dazzling day!\u201dThe king, queen, and prince all hug each other and smile while looking at the sky.Curtains fall.It was a really tragic story. As the story unfolds in an unusually reversed order, the three family members end up embracing each other and smiling without even knowing the future.It was a tragedy that only us outside the play knew all the truth.Iglanced at Anakin next to me, but he didn\u2019t seem to care because he didn\u2019t have a family. So I asked him something I was curious about.\u201cIf the world you live in was one big play, how would you feel?\u201d\u201cYou mean a play?\u201d\u201cYeah. Everything is fixed, and you have to act according to your role. You may not be the main character. It may be a supporting role, or maybe it\u2019s a passer-by role close to the background.\u201dIglanced at him softly. Usually most people don\u2019t want to believe that their world is not true. It\u2019s because you\u2019re being denied the life you\u2019ve lived for the rest of your life.If I had heard such a thing in Korea, I would have denied it, thinking it was a new type of pseudonym. Aside from that, everyone often despairs at the fact that they are not important.But Anakin, as always, gracefully defies my expectations. He answered in his usual calm tone,\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you mad?\u201d\u201cWell. I\u2019m living my life to the best of my ability right now. That\u2019s enough\u2026 I think.\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re not the main character? Even if you\u2019re deprived of your rightful attention or likes for just one reason?\u201d\u201cA knight is not someone who gets anyone\u2019s attention anyway. If I wanted that, I would have chosen another profession.\u201dNo wonder it seemed so sour. I pouted out of disgust at Anakin, who would never give me the answer wanted.\u201cYou really have no ambition, no goal.\u201d\u201cDoes it look that way? I thought I was trying to live my life. Everyone is making the same effort, so I don\u2019t think it needs to stand out.\u201dThat made me a little bit regretful of my remarks. One shouldn\u2019t judge others\u2019 efforts recklessly\u2026\u2026 In fact, how ridiculous would my efforts to die be seen by others.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right. Because everyone here is living. Just as the shadows get darker when the light approaches I guess those kinds of efforts can only be seen when death is near.\u201dAt the same time, a band in charge of the play\u2019s music came out to the square and started playing. It was an upbeat song made for dancing.At first the people were only clapping to the rhythm once they noticed, they started dancing in pairs around the band one by one. As I was looking at him, in the cheerful atmosphere, Anakin quietly added.\u201cActually, not everyone needs to know that I\u2019m trying.\u201d\u201cOnly you, my master, should know. Isn\u2019t it so?\u201dEyes staring straight back at each other, a heartbeat thudding, crashing. I wanted to think of what to say but my mind is blank with embarrassment. I should have answered.\u2018You\u2019re wonderful\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m thankful\u2019, or something like that\u2026But I was always clumsy with people who were good to me rather than people who hated me.From lovers, friends\u2026 even to family.Maybe it\u2019s because I am suspicious and eccentric by nature. If it was a favor, I first thought about why. If you came to me because you wanted something, you would hand it over as if you were making a deal.I was suddenly afraid for no reason. Why are you so good to me? I had nothing to give to such a person, so I had no choice but to pour him affection. I was scared. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll pour out more affection than thought I could. Melted objects cannot be picked up and restored again.Maybe it was because I was afraid that the person who showed me a favor would come to hate me. If have this person in my heart and suddenly he goes out on his own or leaves me. I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand, the emptiness. Because I am such a selfish person.So I pushed them away one more time. Those feelings that can\u2019t be undone once you spit them out.I decided to sit down at a noisy restaurant that was preparing breakfast and opened the newspaper. Fortunately, the languages of this world have many similarities to English. To be precise, it must be said that English, French, Spanish, and Latin are mixed. It seems that the author could not create a new language due to the limitations of knowledge,The innkeeper who was putting the food down looks at my face.\u201cGoodness, lady. Don\u2019t you resemble Lady Mis\u00e9rian, the talk of the town?\u201dI opened the newspaper and responded slyly.\u201cI hear that a lot. A country bumpkin has moved up.\u201dAt my dismissive tone, the innkeeper, saying it was a compliment, soon disappeared, still suspicious. I skimmed through the newspaper, and on page 2 was the article I wanted to read.Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s disappearance! Magic train, is itreally safe?Wow, nice article title! There was no picture, but Eris was a face everyone in the capital knew anyway. I stumbled through reading the article.The conventional means of transportation was based on horses as the driving force. However, since horses are living creatures, they have the disadvantage of needing to give them a rest if they run over a certain distance.In addition, no matter how luxurious it was, the limitation of the carriage was that they were narrow and inconvenient.The \u2018Magic Train\u2019 is a masterpiece created by the mage engineers belonging to the state saying they have greatly improved the means of transportation. Although it is slower than the maximum speed of a horse, the \u2018Magic Train\u2019s great technological advancement was in that it does not need to rest.However, no matter how safe the magic engineers claimed the \u2018Magic Train\u2019 to be, the magic technology itself was unstable, and the speed of the train was slow compared to the astronomical initial cost to create the technology. So there were concerns that street robbers could access the train at any time.In order to dispel such concerns, the Marquis Mis\u00e9rian, one of the biggest investors in the Magic Train, has come up with a trump card. He tried to prove the train\u2019s safety by sending his daughter on a magic train, it backfired as she went missing on the train.Not only that, the fact that the number of passengers on the train can hold is smaller than expected which is a big problem to match one\u2019s concept of a luxury train. No matter how expensive the train ticket is, considering the investment cost and maintenance cost, it is not worth the money.\u2026..With many questions entangled in her disappearance, will the magic train make its way back safely?The article was very good. As I watched the big picture of the royal family and the marquis looking ruined, my taste buds began to crave sustenance. In an instant, ate the food on the plate and finished my drink. What am I going to do now\u2026.. Even if I go to the capital, there are only rotten things, so I want to stretch my time out here as much as possible. Shall we take a boat ride as recommended by the kid at the inn?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I want to see the famous lake.\u201d\u201cVery well\u2026\u2026. Is there anything else you need?\u201d\u201cShould I ask him to go there and pack me some food?\u201d\u201cThat would be good, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like something light and not too oily.\u201dBack in the room, I changed clothes and came out. The forsythia-colored two-piece was comfortable and looked good on me.The best thing since coming to Rundol province was that there are no maids to advise you on how you should wear makeup or loose clothes. It\u2019s just that want to look good to others from their perspective, but I\u2019m too lazy to wear makeup.I just combed my hair and wore comfortable shoes without heels.At the front door, the inn child turned around and suddenly put a flower in my ear. How sweet. I gavethe child who knew how to do pretty things some pocket money.It\u2019s a good day because the wind is cool. The boat was tied up in a cabin near the lake. Since the lake was quite far from the inn in the city center, I rode a carriage and entered the forest.The lake was so deep and beautiful. It almost Tooked like I was looking at the sea rather than a small lakeAfter carrying a basket of food into the boat, Anakin sat down and began to row. Without any difficulty, the boat started to move towards the center of the lake.The scenery is beautiful, but as expected Mt. Kumgang is a place where food comes first. When I opened the basket with anticipation, I saw it contained delicious sandwiches, bottled milk, jam, pie and even fruits.I thought the basket looked a little heavy\u2026. The innkeeper must have liked us very much. Anyway, it\u2019s always better to have some leftover food than not enough food. With one ham sandwich in my mouth, put the other one in Anakin\u2019s.I realized when I was eating breakfast this morning that the inn had really good food. As long as the beds were clean and the breakfast delicious, the accommodations were the perfect place for me. I had been debating whether to reveal it or not but I believed it was the right thing to say. It was a fact needed him to know anyway since Anakin would be the best person to get me out of this world.I will reveal a shocking fact to Anakin, who had become somewhat more docile by eating something delicious.\u201cYou are a character in the book I read, Anakin.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve also read about this world in the same book.\u201dThe arms that were rowing suddenly stopped. He blinked and looked at me with a puzzled expression. Not giving him a chance to ask me questions, continued.\u201cYou had a supporting role in the story of \u2018Eris.\u2019 You loved her.\u201dAs I dipped my hand into the lake, the clear, cold, water rushed through my fingers.The surface of the lake, at first, reflected a terrifyingly strange and beautiful woman looking up at me. Then the image was shaken by the ripples from my hand. No, the scariest thing about this face was that it no longer felt unfamiliar.What if I go back to Korea and look in the mirror and see this stranger\u2019s face?\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I took the place of the woman you\u2019d fall in love with.\u201dHow would it feel to lose someone you will love for the rest of your life without knowing it? I couldn\u2019t even imagine it.In fact, nothing in the world was mine. They all belong to Eris Mis\u00e9rian, the second most gorgeous beauty in the world, including him, who will blindly be loyal to me.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t understand. Are you saying I\u2019m\u2026 fake?\u201cMaybe\u2026\u2026. Like a character in a play.\u201dAnakin had a confused face. I deserved it because really sounded crazy insisting that the person he was serving was different. He paused for a moment and asked me again.\u201cWhy are you sure I loved her?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how the book was written. I\u2019ve read it all.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t act the way I\u2019m written?\u201d\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go as the book says, it\u2019s modified by causality. For example, if I get cut off by your sword now, I won\u2019t die. Since the book didn\u2019t say I\u2019m going to die yet.\u201dAnakin blinked slowly. He asked quietly.\u201cYou mean\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll fall in love with you someday?\u201d\u2026\u2026.Huh? I\u2019ve never thought of it that way.\u2019In fact, in the original story, the Black Knight never actually said he loved Eris. Everyone just assumed that the Black Knight loved Eris because he devoted, himself to all sorts of things for her.The book was from Helena\u2019s point of view, and it was only the description that she threw in the story, as if he had really loved Eris. So I naturally thought Anakin might not fall in love with me unless I was Eris.When I didn\u2019t answer, Anakin asked me again.\u201cAre you falling in love with me, too?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI quickly denied it, but it was right. I shouldn\u2019t get attached to anyone in this book. My death was scheduled anyway. Even if I can survive here as \u2018Eris\u2019, must die. So that I can go back.\u201cI won\u2019t love you. So don\u2019t love me, either.\u201dI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fall in love with you. I turned my head away for fear that the words would pop out of my mouth. I think I\u2019m going crazy because I\u2019m having a difficult time. No matter how hard it is, it was rude to fall in love and depend on someone.As I shook my head to calm myself down, I noticed that there was a fairly high cliff near the lake. It is shaped like a diving board.In the past, I\u2019ve seen a movie about dreams. In that movie, the dream felt like reality, so he couldn\u2019t wake up for a while. There were only two ways to return to reality. Dying, or falling into the water.I\u2019ve thought of dying, but I\u2019ve never thought of drowning.I murmured, distracted.\u201cI have to go up there.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the cliff?\u201d\u201cYeah. To fall.\u201dThe lake looked pretty deep, so even if one fell from the top of the cliff, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily die,If you\u2019re not lucky, you might break something because of the surface tension\u2026..The boat suddenly stopped moving, causing me to turn to Anakin. He had a really shocked expression. Somehow Anakin asked in a sullen voice.\u201cIs it because of me?\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense is that? It\u2019s not like that, so hurry up and row.\u201dPhew. He\u2019s so arrogant to think he created a bad mood for a little bit. Anakin with a serious face was ridiculous and cute, so I fed him a piece of pie. He must have been embarrassed, so he kept his mouth shut, attempting to rebel. I raised my eyebrows and poked the pie a few times into his lips.In the end, Anakin lost. Open your mouth and eat well. Some of the jam that came out of the pie got on my hands. As I was about to bring it to my mouth, he quickly blocked it, took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped it off.It was the same as when I brought a mirror from Bonito, glad that Anakin was more prepared and delicate than me.The height off the cliff is considerable. I have never been afraid of heights since I was young. From amusement parks with challenges like the viking ride, roller coasters, gyro drops to even bungee jumping, always took them without hesitation. But this was distinctly different from activities that had safety devices.I hesitated several times and closed my eyes tightly. What\u2019s the point of hesitating with a body that doesn\u2019t die? At any rate, Anakin will take it out on his own.I stepped back slightly and threw myself off.A tingling sensation of my stomach dropping. Before knew I was going to die, I was sucked into the water.White bubbles filled my surroundings and left. The surface of the water was beautiful. I laid down comfortably and breathed out. I felt like I was sinking,It\u2019s not bad if I can die like this. It was a moment to close my eyes.Someone snatched my body roughly. A solid body pulled me up to the water in an instant. Being forced up caused all the water to pass through my nose. Thanks to that person, I couldn\u2019t open my eyes for a long time and coughed.\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u2026\u2026Hey, cough, Ana, kin! Untill give you orders, cough, stay still\u2026 Cough, I told you so.\u201d\u201cAre you out of your mind or something!\u201dThis voice was not Anakin\u2019s. My eyes opened wide. Drenched, Jason was holding me and looking furious. Wait! Why are you here?I shuddered in bewilderment, shaking and realizing that he was holding me. No, no, no\u2026. Let\u2019s not overthink this and let me go.Where the hell was Anakin while Jason did this? I lifted up my face, away from Jason\u2019s body and looked around to see if he would let it go.Then my body was pulled back from behind. Against my back, I felt a familiar and hard chest. It\u2019s Anakin.\u201cHow dare you touch my lady\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cWhat? The knight who failed to protect the lady has something to say?\u201dA spark broke out between the two. I know it\u2019s a comical, novel-like situation but seriously\u2026\u2026 Guys, we\u2019re all still in a lake here.\u201cThe water is cold. I\u2019m going to take my lady out.\u201dSince I was wearing a thin two-piece, even though the midsummer warmth was approaching, it was cold, staying in the water for a long time.The small boat we were riding earlier was parked near the cliff. If I knew this would happen, I should have told Anakin to stay on board. The three of us swam out awkwardly.As soon as he exited the water, Anakin grabbed his coat that was hung in the sun and put it on me. He then got down on one knee and asked me.\u201cShould I light a fire?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still bright out. Won\u2019t my clothing dry if we leaveit?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite a distance to the accommodation. I\u2019d rather\u2026\u201dJason, who came out of the water, swept his hair back with one hand and laughed. With an expression like he\u2019s about to cut off someone\u2019s service, he added, intentionally looking only at me.\u201cI have a teapot. I\u2019ll heat up the milk.\u201dWithout allowing me to say no, he pushed Anakin away and started a fire. When he announced that hewould make a fire, I was so tempted to pull Anakin\u2019s hand and run away.\u201cHow did you know about this, Lord Kazar?\u201d\u201cYou seriously believe there wouldn\u2019t be people looking for you after turning the palace and marquisate upside down?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s later than I expected. I didn\u2019t know that Lord hazar would personally come, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI volunteered. To find you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 32Perverse ManWhy? My forehead wrinkled in confusion. Although it was said that he was a leisurely man, Jason was not such a laid-back person. Since it had been awhile since returned to his hometown, it would be normal for him to make rounds, visiting relatives. In fact, in the Kazar family, parties are held every day.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be the busiest person in the capital, having to greet all the elders in your family?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t like having to talk to old people for a long time.\u201d\u201cWell I don\u2019t like talking to you either.\u201d\u201cThen can I mix things other than words?\u201dHas he become really crazy? Jason was setting up the teapot and milk he was carrying, and at the same time, sexually harassing me. Though he could have avoided it, Jason seemed to be hit in the face with something. Without even wiping his wet face, he spoke quietly, with his eyes open.\u201c\u2026What you\u2019re going through.\u201d\u201cIf you start speaking roughly, don\u2019t be surprised if I respond roughly as well.\u201dJason wiped the water off his face with his palm. Losing my appetite, I placed my glass down on the ground.Jason continued.\u201c\u2026l care about you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you doing something that bothers you?\u201d\u201cAre you blaming me now?\u201dI stared at him, at the ridiculous transfer of responsibility, but he didn\u2019t budge, his face was determined.\u201cYes, so Lady Mis\u00e9rian, please let me know. How can I do that?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me that? You never cared aboutme.\u201dJason burst out laughing. The flames were warm, and he held his hand gently.I thought that I could rest for a long time, but now, couldn\u2019t. Whether Jason came by royal command or sent by the marquis, I was in a position to be captured and returned. I shook my hands to get a sense of how much I would be questioned.\u201cHow\u2019s the capital?\u201d\u201cTell me how you\u2019ve been and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cVery well. Let\u2019s pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cCause I don\u2019t want to tell you.\u201dJason stared at me with a puzzled expression on his face. I didn\u2019t care if he looked at me in that way. How could I look fine when he was the one that warned me about Helena in the first place.I might have been nicer if they had sent a stranger instead of Jason, Jason looked at my cold face and raised both hands.\u201cAll right, all right. This ugly affair has everyone fully engaged. The capital city is in a state of chaos because of Lady Mis\u00e9rian. I\u2019m telling this to you as the person who suddenly disappeared. Because the train is faulty it has stopped at its last stop.\u201dThe train was stopped? That\u2019s not what I did.\u201cMore importantly, finding you became a top priority, You didn\u2019t ascend to the throne, but since you\u2019ve had your coming-of-age ceremony, you\u2019re a half imperial family member, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026. Well, from your attitude, you seem to have run away on purpose.\u201d\u201cAre you going to take me right away?\u201dHe tilted his head with a sly smile.\u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends on how many different excuses Lady Mis\u00e9rian will provide me.\u201dIndeed, handsome men in this world seem to have a knack for being annoying.Even more irritating because unlike the other two men, Jason seemed to be very good at using his looks. Should I say \u2018I was messing around\u2019 though it\u2019s slang?I sighed and ordered Anakin.\u201cAnakin, I have to go back, so pack up as soon as you get to the inn.\u201d\u201cYou are indeed buried. How can you not lose a word?\u201d (T/N: Jason is teasing Eris saying she\u2019s under water/buried/submerged. He wonders how she could so easily give up, not arguing further.)Speechless for a moment, I almost laughed. I asked Jason without concealing my irritation.\u201cWhy should I lose to you? Tell me, Lord Kazar. Give me a good reason and I\u2019ll let you win.\u201d\u201cSometimes it\u2019s important to keep up with your opponent, Lady Mis\u00e9rian. It\u2019s not just about losing and winning. If you act like that, you will only have unnecessary enemies in the future.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dHaving friends doesn\u2019t mean it would be good for me. When I looked at Helena, I could see that. What could you do against three handsome and powerful men? Even Eris, who has no friends, can\u2019t stop her.\u201cI already have many enemies. What does it matter if there are one or two more or even fewer of them?\u201d\u201cIs that right? What if I am the enemy?\u201d\u201cHave you not been my enemy so far? I thought you\u2019d already declared war against me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019ve got a weakness for me.\u201dWeakness? Did you meet Hubris or Mattheus? My head spun quickly. Although Bonito is definitely near Rundol, it is too early to think so.Since the train hadn\u2019t returned from the last stop, he would have had no choice but to come by horse, and it was said that the distance to Bonito would have taken five days at the very least.Bonito, which was closer than Rundol, takes the same amount of time, so it was clear that he had left as soon as he got the news that I had arrived at Rundol at this time.Are you going to say you ran away with a knight under the pretext of love?\u201dFor a moment, I was worried but Jason quickly pointed out the futility of it.\u201cThe Imperial Family, do you know how they will act if this is known to the Marquis? Your knight will be decapitated for seducing you, and you will immediately be trapped in the palace to live for the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cIs the escape of love too romantic for your age, Lord Kazar. Would you think of that if you saw me jump off a cliff?\u201dPerhaps because he was a hero, the idea was fresh considering he was still young in aristocratic society Or rather, he may have heard too much about the love stories of a minstrel while travelling. Only one lover jumps off a cliff, and the other watches it, or they both jump.\u201cI came to Rundol to die.\u201dThis was a lie, but it didn\u2019t matter. Going to Bonito was one of the efforts for death. Even though I had no income, at least I knew why I came here.Jason laughed in disbelief.\u201cLies. Be honest, Lady Mis\u00e9rian. I know that. When someone falls in love, everyone becomes disorganized.\u201d\u201cIf you want to believe it\u2019s a lie, believe it.\u201dSlowly, very slowly, the smile disappeared from Jason\u2019s face. And like how ink smudges in the water, a vivid wonder emerged on his face.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDo you really need a reason?\u201d\u201cWhat am I missing?\u201dI picked myself up as I rummaged through the extinguished embers. I looked down at him and replied quietly.\u201cI\u2019m not sad that I am going to die.\u201dHowever further explain, Jason wouldn\u2019t understand. He was a man who wanted to live a little longer, even though he was named a mercenary and his death was certain. He wanted to live, because he wanted to go back and meet\u2026\u2026 because of Helena\u2019s love.\u201cI don\u2019t regret a single thing even if my body collapses right now.\u201dIt was a huge difference that could not be filled with mild sympathy.While Anakin went to the inn to organize our luggage, I was still thinking that I should buy souvenirs since came on a trip.The Rundol region was famous for its lakes and sausages, but the sausages were a little\u2026 If I were in Korea, I would have bought it with a drink, but I felt guilty consuming alcohol in the body of a young lady, a noblewoman.Would there be something appropriate if I look around the shopping district? It would be better to choose by looking at it myself. As I got ready to go out again, Jason asked.\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d\u201cI have something I want to buy.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go together.\u201dDespite my face crumpling with signs of displeasure, Jason didn\u2019t respond as if he was surrounded by an iron wall. Not everyone can be a cold-hearted hero. Itwas admirable. Though he had the nerve to answer back.\u201cDo you think Lady Mis\u00e9rian will only run away once? You probably want to sneak away again this time so should I thank you?\u201dIt was really dirty and cheap, but I held it in because I had nothing to say.There were quite a few people on the streets even during the day in Rundol. I kept looking around to see if there were any interesting shops while Jason kept coughing in vain to draw my attention. Annoyed, coughed back to indicate that I was safe.\u201cSince you are coughing, you must not be feeling well. Why not go back to rest and stop following me?\u201d\u201cI think Lady Mis\u00e9rian needs help.\u201dI stood to the side with a crooked look on my face, expressing, \u2018If you say nonsense, I will kill you.\u2019 Still I wanted to hear it.In the book, Jason captured Helena\u2019s heart with interesting stories. Since Helena had lived inside the palace all her life, whenever Jason talked, she would dream about the world he shared. Jason saw her, fell in love with her and promised that he would take her out someday, \u2018Let\u2019s go on an adventure together, to the sea\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s go\u2026\u2019It was because of the crown prince that she stayed in the palace for a while. Even though Hubris was a high priest, he mainly wandered the city slums to provide relief, so he was not fit for any trips or adventure.\u201cThe Rundol region is not only famous for its lakes and meat. Another thing it is famous for are the raw stones from the bottom of the lake. There is a legend that if you wear jewelry made from the lake\u2019s stones, you can live a long life without disease.\u201dThough the explanation was very much like a package tour guide, it was interesting. Gemstones would not be too fancy or shiny, so servants could easily carry them around. Plus, a healthy and long life, it was perfect. It was better to live a long and healthy life than to make a fortune.Seeing my expression, Jason asked triumphantly.\u201cShall I guide you?\u201dI nodded, but somehow I felt like I had just lost, and thus felt a little anger.As soon as we entered the store, the handsome owner greeted us.\u201cWelcome! Our shop is called the Rolling Stones, a gemstone shop selling Vivian\u2019s tears.\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201dLaughter almost erupted at the familiar name, but I held it in by biting my molars tightly. The inside of the store was packed full of what seemed to be ordinary stones.Even though the store claims it is a raw stone, not a gem, it was a bit disconcerting as they seemed no more than a pebble. Are you really not a scammer? As if my thoughts were evident from my expression, the owner hurriedly approached me and rubbed his hand.\u201cOh, madam. Would you like a present?\u201d\u201cMadam?\u201d\u201cWoah, isn\u2019t the person next to you, your husband?\u201dNext to me, Jason grinned and was about to put his hand on my shoulder. I brushed his hand away, and responded with a sting of anger.\u201cNot my husband. We are not like that. I want to give a present to my servants, now bring me a suitable item.\u201d\u201cOh, excuse me!\u201dThe store owner bowed apologetically several times, then hurriedly disappeared behind me.\u201cI\u2019m hurt, you cut that with a single knife.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dWhether you get hurt or not, why do I care? It\u2019s funnier when he tries to pretend to be her husband, knowing she has a fianc\u00e9.The owner returned with the box in his arms. Then, one by one, he displayed them to me.\u201cThere is a reason why the gemstone in Lake Fairy is called Vivian\u2019s tears. Although it looks ordinary on the outside, it\u2019s inside\u2026\u201dThe gemstone was then cut in half, and I saw inside, there was a mysterious and transparent blue color mixed with green and blue. It was just like the color of the lake. Though it\u2019s not a jewel, it emitted a soft and beautiful light.\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? It falls in a circular shape under the lake, and even its color resembles a lake, so it became famous as a fairy\u2019s tears. It is a specialty that only comes from this lake, so everyone in the Rundol region buys one.\u201d\u201c\u2026A pendant or bracelet, which one is better?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to give it to your servants, they\u2019d probably like a pendant or\u2026 a necklace, as it shouldn\u2019t be an issue when they are working.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll purchase it as a necklace. Just pack me five or six.\u201dAs I finished the calculation, Jason was carefully selecting gemstones next to me.It looked like he was going to give it to Helena. But why was he looking at raw stones when he could just buy one that\u2019s already made?\u201cAre you going to give it to Lady Antebellum?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I want to make it myself.\u201d\u201cWhy waste your time when you can just buy what\u2019s made. What would you do if you fail?\u201dJason gives me a subtle smile.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I want her to carry something that\u2019s stained by my hands\u201dYou perverted man. I had to manage my expression, but my face crinkled at the needlessly honest answer.Even if the words contained the same meaning, the feeling evoked would be different depending on the expression. It\u2019s not like there was no sincerity in it, but didn\u2019t he sound like a pervert wandering around looking for the stockings she was wearing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 33Of Knights and BanditsJason\u2019s face turned red as soon as he saw my expression. I thought Hubris was the one with a dark side, but it seemed Jason also had a dark side.Why is it only around me that these men honestly show their true colors\u2026.. Once again, I felt sympathy for Helena.I decided to no longer pay any attention to Jason, and I looked around the gemstone a little more. A particularly dark stone stood out among the sparkling blue stones.\u201cAh, sometimes non-blue stones come out of the lake, They are purple stones. However, compared to blue stones, the color is turbid, soft and prone to scratches.\u201dI remembered what Hubris told me, that the color of my soul was purple. I don\u2019t even like purple, but suddenly I roll the stone in my hand.The color was cloudy, the softness wasn\u2019t pleasant, and it was not sold because it did not shine\u2026 It reminded me of myself.\u201cOwner, make a necklace with this gemstone. In a shape like this.\u201d\u201cReally? It must be uncomfortable\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s none of your business.\u201dWhen I returned to the inn, Anakin was quietly waiting for me, even though we had little luggage. Good boy. As I was stroking his hair, Jason spoke without notice.\u201cAre you coming with me?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s a long trip, and if I look at your face, I might vomit.\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian! You\u2019re too harsh!\u201d\u201cOh, and what you said to me wasn\u2019t bad enough. Mix, what? Is that what one says to their friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9e?\u201dJason bit his lips and made an excuse in a small voice,\u201cThat was a slip of the tongue. Still.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying it. If you\u2019re afraid that I\u2019ll run away, then follow me. Aren\u2019t you an expert in following others?\u201dAnyway, I had something for Anakin, so I turned around again. He was standing still, gently blinking his eyes.\u201cAnakin, get on your knees.\u201dAs he knelt obediently, I took out the necklace I had bought earlier from my pocket. The well-cut purple gemstone dangled in the center. It was fortunate that Anakin\u2019s neck was thin. The short black strap looked very good on him.Anakin shifted awkwardly, as if he was not familiar with a necklace in the form of a choker. He must be frustrated. Well, actually, it was like a dog collar to the people here. I said, holding his hand as he clasped his neck.\u201cAre you uncomfortable?\u201dYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re honest. I made it inconvenient.\u201dWhenever he feels uncomfortable with his neck, he\u2019ll remember me giving it to him. The words I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say settle down. I don\u2019t know why my eves followed his face. Confused eyes that did not understand gazed back at me, causing me to quickly turn away. I\u2019ve just indicated to Jason that I had a dark side as well, so I kept silent.Impatient because my feet were starting to get numb, Thollered out.\u201cWell, aren\u2019t we going?\u201d\u201cWell, Master. Since it\u2019s a long distance, I\u2019m worried if I\u2019m the only escort. The fact that the master has been announced missing has already spread widely, so if you meet a bandit in the middle of the trip, it might be dangerous. Wouldn\u2019t it be safer for all of us to go together?\u201dIglared at Jason after Anakin\u2019s explanation. Jason in turn smiled at me softly. Fuming as I didn\u2019t want to respond, I turned my head away.I had heard about thieves who like to set up camp on every street corner and I wondered if Anakin\u2019s concern was about that. Thieves tried to stop everypassing carriage to see if Lady Mis\u00e9rian was riding in it or not.No matter how close Anakin was to the level of a Sword Master, he still had not yet achieved it.Though Sword Masters can\u2019t be beaten by an ordinary person\u2019s tactics, it was because he would have to fight and protect me at the same time, that I reluctantly allowed this.We bought a seemingly simple-looking carriage and disguised Anakin as a coachman. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that it was the most uncomfortable carriage that I had ever ridden in. Instead of being simple, Anakin and Jason decided on a horse that was fast and strong.Jason and I didn\u2019t say a word in the carriage. To be precise, Jason looked like he wanted to talk to me, but I ignored him. No matter how many times he called my name, the sound of horseshoes was so loud that I pretended not to hear it.But Jason really was a man with a greater persistence than I thought.\u201cWhy does Lady Mis\u00e9rian hate Helena so much? Are you jealous?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI was surprised at Jason\u2019s lack of imagination and forethought. Quite frankly, Eris had a very good reason to hate Helena.Who, in their right mind, would enjoy seeing another beautiful woman hanging on to their fianc\u00e9? Especially when Eris had her heart set for the crown prince!\u201cSir Kazar, are you asking me because you truly don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cIs it because Helena has the crown prince\u2019s attention?\u201d\u201cYou seem to be mistaken, also if I were to hate you, would have hated you even more than Helena. I don\u2019t \u2018hate\u2019 Lady Antebellum that much. I don\u2019t even bother anymore.\u201d\u201cThen why did you bully her when she was such a young girl?\u201d\u201cBecause I was young then.\u201dEris was younger than fifteen when she decided to \u2018outrageously\u2019 bully Helena. Of course being young didn\u2019t mean she had to be self-centered. At a young age, it was easier to be hurt by others.\u201cAre all sins forgiven because you were young? Do, you still look down on your friend, Lady Antebellum?\u201dIt seemed unfair to hear or receive advice from a person who was actively harassing \u2018Eris\u2019 in the past.\u201cBe careful of your words, Sir Kazar. As you said earlier, after the coming-of-age ceremony, I am officially a member of the royal family!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not cold to her, in fact I am more open to her. I am just giving her the same courtesy I would to anyone of her position. Friend? Does she now say I\u2019m a friend?\u201dI decided to just abuse the power in the yard that didn\u2019t even break the marriage. This was from the guy who\u2019s using this authority to give me orders when I can\u2019t even break off the marriage? How dare he say such things to a royal family member!Hearing those words from Jason\u2019s mouth, who doesn\u2019t treat me as if I was Helena\u2019s friend, made him feel like a hypocrite. Even if his mouth was crooked, he should try to speak honestly. Trying to be my friend when you really don\u2019t want to be my friend due to some lowly conscience?!\u201cDoes Sir Kazar view Lady Antebellum as a close friend? You dare tell me that she is my close friend under the false pretense that you are being \u2018my friend\u2019?\u201dAt that moment, Jason\u2019s mouth shut tight as if he regretted his words.\u201cShould I not forgive you forever as well?\u201dSuddenly a shout was heard outside the carriage.The carriage stopped and I unintentionally tried to look outside. Jason pulled out his sword and went out first.\u201cIf you leave now, I will spare your life.\u201d\u201d Hahaha! What nonsense are you talking about? We saw you take the lady into the carriage, so you need to leave so that I can have the lady.\u201dBefore I left the inn, I was a little terrified to hear there were bandits targeting me but to see them actually appear before my eyes was surprising. Hearing other shouts, I realized that the bandit was not alone.\u201cI\u2019ll probably regret this, who knows.\u201dHowever, Jason replied calmly and brought his head back into the carriage. He reached out his hand to me and whispered, inaudible to those outside.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, please get on your horse and leave with your knight right now.\u201d\u201cWhat? You?\u201dCan\u2019t we just fight together and go back? When came out led by his hand, the number of bandits was a little more than I imagined\u2026\u2026 Actually, there was quite a lot.\u201cIf that\u2019s all the bandits we\u2019ll meet, we\u2019ll get rid of them and leave together, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201dHe scrunched his nose in embarrassment, smiled, and added with a bitter expression.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s accusations and punishments will be sweetened again by returning to the capital, so don\u2019t be too angry. Take Lady Mis\u00e9rian there.\u201d\u201cHey, Sir Kazar!\u201dTo be honest, I knew in my head that the path Jason suggested was the best option. But my heart was not willing to obey him.Before I could protest, I was lifted by Anakin who placed me on the horse and seated himself behindme.He was smiling. You\u2019re doing this on purpose to avoid it! Seriously?!!\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. Please sit down.\u201d\u201cLet go of me\u2013, for real?!\u201dI should have learned magic from a witch. I should\u2019ve struck him with a bolt of fire on the top of his head and turned him bald.How annoying!By the way, riding on horseback was very painful when the seat was hard. Even if it was uncomfortable, I was in a situation where I had to run away, so I was patient, but Anakin spoke quietly.\u201cIt will be more comfortable if you relax and lean your back against my chest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Fine.\u201dIt\u2019s a little better to lean on Anakin almost like a hug, but that was the only thing \u2026my butt still hurts. Ugh\u2026\u2026 I feel like there will be bruises there.\u201cAnakin, how far is the capital?\u201d\u201cI drove the carriage for two days, so there\u2019s about one more day to go.\u201d\u201cA day on horseback? By the time I get there, my butt will be black and blue.\u201dSighing, I asked Anakin with a troubled face.\u201cShall we go to the village and buy some cushions?\u201d\u201cOkay. When are we going to find time to find and tie up a cushion? If I had known this would happen, would have worn a thick skirt.\u201dBy the way, I was already in a bad mood at the thought of going back to the capital. Anakin hesitated and talked to me first, perhaps because he knew me.\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dThis was a great development, seeing that Anakin spoke up first. On the other hand, I wonder if it was because I was so grumpy. I really can\u2019t kick Anakin who can easily roll away.\u201cOkay. What kind of story are you going to tell me? Is it your story?\u201d\u201cMy story won\u2019t be interesting. I\u2019ve lived a smoothlife.\u201d\u201cNot every life has to be dramatic.\u201d\u201c\u2026If I have to tell a story, I want to tell about the present. I\u2019m not the type to focus on the past.\u201dAt first glance, I wondered if it was some endless romantic tale, but then I had a habit of thinking negatively about anything said.Even if I become the past, will he move forward so, casually? Somehow, I felt a sense of ambivalence. I hoped so. Because I know the sorrows of those left behind. Memories are sometimes torture.Then I thought I was too arrogant, and I laughed. I may not be as important to him as I think.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m sure if he was chosen by someone else, he would show the same loyalty as he does now.I then realized that I would be sad if this were true. Even more so, if he tells me that I wasn\u2019t as important to him as he was to me\u2026The human heart is not a formula, so I know that I shouldn\u2019t expect to get paid for the effort I put in. Yet still\u2026 I want this person I have a crush on to love me as much as I did.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to look back.\u201dAnakin said in a low voice. At his words, I looked up at him. He was looking ahead, instead of me.\u201cDon\u2019t even ask me what I\u2019m going to do in the future, I can only do one thing at a time because I have a simple mind and can only take on one thing at a time.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cFor now\u2026 I\u2019m helping the master to go back.\u201d\u2026Yes. For this reason, I like him. I couldn\u2019t blame him for my sharpness. Anakin watches over me, who is capricious.I think I will remember him for quite a long time even when I return to Korea. So I want him to remember me as much as I remember him, even though I know it\u2019s selfish.When I go back, I must plant a lily-of-the-valley. And until the flower fades\u2026\u2026***As soon as I arrived at the mansion, the maids and attendants violently rushed at me with half screams As I entered the mansion, I could hear their voices that contained both reassurance and anger.Also, it was the marquis who was the first person to confront me. Still on the stairwell, he looked down at me coldly.\u201cCome into my room\u2026 and no one will enter until !call.\u201dI gave a worried Emma the gemstone I had purchased from Rundol and followed the marquis to his room. When I entered, he turned away from me.\u201cDid you need me for something?\u201d\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201dWhen I pretended to be innocent, the marquis quickly turned around and thundered.\u201cDon\u2019t think you can avoid my eyes! Why didn\u2019t you go straight to the Rundol region!?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.It wasn\u2019t that important. Do I have to tell you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve ruined everything! What are you going to do with this loss? Don\u2019t you really see why I asked you to take a knight? To avoid the eyes of others and deal with dirty and nasty things on your behalf!\u201dPacing around, he didn\u2019t seem to be able to find out what caused me to derail or where the derailmentwas.He sighed inside and deliberately switched to a completely odd point.\u201cYou\u2019re saying strange things. It wasn\u2019t you who chose Anakin, it was me.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dI crossed my arms and tilted my head, pondering. It was the first thing I noticed. There was really nothing to be done to undo the damage.The marquis won\u2019t be able to accuse me. And it was even better if the marquis got angry and forgot why! escaped to a place other than the Rundol region.\u201cYeah, well. I\u2019m not your daughter anyway. You knew that, didn\u2019t you? Since you know, you don\u2019t have to keep up with the facade anymore.\u201d\u201cHow dare you\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, if you don\u2019t want me to die, you\u2019d better not say the same old saying. Because I\u2019m crazy about dying.\u201d\u201cHa! There\u2019s something nasty and vulgar about my daughter.\u201dWhile looking at my nails, I was speechless and snorted.\u201cYou didn\u2019t really love your daughter anyway.\u201dIf you really love a child, you can\u2019t hit or scold him or her. You\u2019ll raise him or her unconditionally.However, the marquis did whatever Eris wanted. More precisely, the marquis made Eris want things that benefit him.\u201cIf you loved her, you should have broken up her marriage. Instead, you were pretending not to know because of the power you would gain, you didn\u2019t really know that a woman with a good eye was festering because of the crown prince?\u201d\u201cShut up! What do you know! I loved her! I wanted her to be at the top!\u201d\u201cThe best position doesn\u2019t mean happiness.\u201dI approached the marquis, who made a ridiculous excuse, and looked up at him.\u201cLook at the so-called \u2018best\u2019 people around you. Look at the faces of the ones in the palace. Did she really look happy?\u201dThe marquis shut his mouth. Indeed, even if one\u2019s mouth is torn, one won\u2019t say that he is happy with the political arena that\u2019s full of slander.\u201c\u2026What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cIf I tell you, will you help me?\u201d\u201cIt depends.\u201d\u201cForget it. I already have a better helper than you.\u201d\u2018If he hears of my plan to die, the marquis will try to block my plan, which will never be good. The marquis is burning now. Because he doesn\u2019t know me\u2019.He was scared because he couldn\u2019t get over it. Neither fear nor conciliation works. It\u2019s a waste to throw away, but it\u2019s dangerous to hold.As soon as the marquis tried to open his mouth, a knock was heard on the door.\u201cWhat? I told you not to disturb me.\u201d\u201cMarquis, a servant, has come from the Imperial Palace.\u201cHe came here under the orders of the Empress, so I will go in now.\u201dIt was customary to not be able to refuse an imperial servant, so whatever the marquis was doing now, he had to stop, while I needed to greet the servant who came to deliver the empress\u2019 message.The marquis withdrew, still trembling with angry expression as the distinguished royal servant entered in an expressionless face.\u201cYour Majesty has something to tell you, so she has ordered Lady Mis\u00e9rian to come along.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cYes, the carriage is ready. Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s clothes\u2026\u201dThe servant looked up and down at me.I didn\u2019t look good because it came directly from Rundol province. Even clothes were rustic and comfortable two-piece dresses that ordinary people would wear. Having just come directly from the Rundol province, my attire was lacking. The clothing was rustic and designed as a comfortable two-piece dress worn only by ordinary people.The servant stopped for a moment, thinking this was not the case, but soon gave up and continued.\u201cIt\u2019s a great shame, but I\u2019m sure the Empress will forgive you, too.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t dare to keep her waiting.\u201dI bowed slightly to the marquis with a sneaky smile.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be back, Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI could feel the marquis\u2019 stinging gaze, but I didn\u2019t care. I currently have the upper hand anyways.As I entered the palace and walked along the courthouse, everyone around me stared at me. Upon moving further in, many stopped and whispered to each other.The lady who dominated the social world came back as a beggar, so she deserved it.Regardless of their gossip, I knew I would not be allowed to rest the moment I arrived so I didn\u2019t have the heart to pay them any heed.I knew the empress, who didn\u2019t even like me, had called me to say something but my focus was to reply promptly and return home quickly to rest.\u201cYour Majesty, Lady Mis\u00e9rian, the eldest daughter of the Marquis Mis\u00e9rian and the fianc\u00e9e of the Crown Prince, is waiting for an audience.\u201cCome in.\u201dWhen the door opened, I was greeted by the empress who stood there looking flawless. She smiled with a friendly expression and greeted me as if she was apologetic.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for calling you so quickly that you can\u2019t even take a break.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s a glorious afternoon, Your Majesty. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re calling me about the rumors.\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you, you guys stay out for a while.\u201dAll the maids in the room escaped at the order of the empress. When I tilted my head slightly in wonder, the empress calmly extended her hand and offered a teacup\u2026\u2026\u2026. This country enjoys drinking black tea, but somehow the color of this black tea was really dark.\u201cIt\u2019s tea from West Station. I heard it\u2019s good for it\u2019s scent and rejuvenation properties.\u201dWhen I picked up the cup and smelled it, it smelled similar yet different to coffee. The empress was not foolish enough to recommend poisoned teas.In the first place, drinking poisoned tea was not enough to kill me. If that was possible, I would have escaped from this world already.\u201cAre you worried that you might be poisoned?\u201d\u201cHow could that be? I\u2019m hesitant because I can\u2019t drink hot items very well, so I needed the tea to cool down a little.\u201dI laughed it off, but it\u2019s getting uncomfortable. The timing was a bit off. There was no reason for the empress to call me. Was the Magic Train a project run by the empress? No, it wasn\u2019t. I breathed in the scent of exotic tea, not having any idea how to describe it.\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t come out of the room. Aren\u2019t you that kind of child? Rebelling so you get enough attention.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a silly girl so I can\u2019t even begin to guess what Your Majesty is telling me. If you don\u2019t mind, can you help me understand?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve become quite clever. Since the coming-of-age ceremony, or\u2026\u2026 Has that mind of yours changed?\u201dAt the coming-of-age ceremony, I knew the empress had done it to humiliate me, but I didn\u2019t expect her to tell me this directly. The empress folded her eyes and laughed at my silence.\u201cYou knew I had given that child the same dress as yours. Right?\u201dNow, what are we going to do at this confession?The empress came out openly so it was no good for me to lie.If you lie and get caught, you\u2019ll only get in trouble. replied with the most harmless smile possible.\u201cI really didn\u2019t know until I met Lady Antebellum. But.\u201d,\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cI knew Madame always had an extra set just in case, Lady Antebellum, who was a commoner, who had no chance to meet the Madame, would not be able to get those clothes without the consideration of the Empress Dowager. It\u2019s just this silly girl\u2019s guess.\u201dThe empress clapped her hands and laughed. She said, nodding admirably and gently.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian may be more qualified as a detective than as the crown princess. Your reasoning is correct. told Madame to give me the extra set. I ordered a maid to steal the clothes Lord Kazar had sent to her, and thus she had to wear the same dress as you.\u201dShe confessed the truth of that day in a calm tone, Her expression and tone were so nonchalant that I didn\u2019t even get angry. Honestly, I\u2019m not even curious about the reason, but at this point, I think it\u2019s only polite to ask.\u201cWhy did you do that to the girl?\u201dAt my question, she drank tea quietly before answering with an unusual expression.\u201cBecause, I hate you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 35Tacit Permission\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too strong and indifferent to be a princess. What if you become the Empress? If the Marquis, the backbone of the aristocracy, becomes a single-handed Marquis, what will the campaign be like?\u201dI don\u2019t care if I can\u2019t be a princess, but honestly, the empress\u2019s logic was a little bizarre.\u201cSo you chose Lady Antebellum, from a family of traitors and a commoner? She has been a maid all her life and knows nothing about the position of the Empress.\u201d\u201cIt is like an orphan in need of love, her personality will be obedient and kind, she will obey the imperial family, and she has captured the heart of the prince because of her beauty, so there is no need to worry about future generations. Even if we can\u2019t teach her the duties of the empress position until she ascends the throne, it will be fine.\u201dShe meant to make Helena a puppet.I couldn\u2019t afford to look into anyone\u2019s future, but wondered if Helena already had a future she wasn\u2019t aware of.\u201cDid Lady Antebellum say she would? She was really scared and ran away the last time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you scared her.\u201d\u201cLike I strongly love him?\u201d\u201cYou will fall in love. What can you do when a child as good as Alecto whispers love?\u201dHer self-confidence was reasonable. It\u2019s one of my personal resentments, but the crown prince, the male protagonist of the novel, has the same terrifying and destructive beauty as Helena.Blond hair, which melted gold on white and beautiful rosy skin, scattered neatly just by turning its head slightly. The color of the sky blue eyes was sometimes mixed with golden brown to give off a subtle glow.The tall, straight nose and deep eyelids seemed to contain a story, and the lips thinner than Hubris or Jason were rather nerve-wracking.I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was the most handsome man in the world when he filmed (Total Eclipse) orCatch Me If You Can). But after seeing Alecto, realized that there could be someone more handsome than him.Appearance is not the number one requirement for falling in love but it is inevitable that attraction starts first with a person\u2019s appearance before you begin to figure out what\u2019s inside.If he hadn\u2019t been such a ruffian to me, I might have had some feelings for him.How much worse if they chase after you saying they like you\u2026.I don\u2019t know why Helena still doesn\u2019t like the crown prince. Is it because the prettiest girl in the world is facing the mirror?\u201cNo, let\u2019s be honest with each other.\u201dThe empress suddenly waved her hands and spoke intently. Possessing a gracious face, yet everything that was said out of her mouth was poison.\u201cDo you hate or resent me for making such a scene in the place where you deserve to shine the most? But no matter what you think of me, I will hate you more than you hate me.\u201dThe empress put down the teacup and stared straight at me. If her eyes were a physical weapon, I would have been stabbed to death by her at this moment,\u201cI want to kill you. I don\u2019t want you to just die. I want you to die in great pain. I know it wasn\u2019t you who killed my son. No offense to you, but you are the most precious thing the Marquis has, so there is nothing we can do about it.\u201dI remembered a play that I saw in Rundol.The actress who played the empress was screaming. Did the empress who lost the crown prince scream like that?\u201cIt is natural for human beings to become angry when a dog is stoned to death. How does it feel to be framed by the Marquis and lose my son and close friends?\u201dThe empress gritted her teeth and clenched her fists. Her fists trembled on her lap. She seemed to be struggling to contain her emotions.\u201cSince that day, I\u2019ve been vomiting blood every night. Even in my dreams, I hear my son crying. My life is already hell, so what if I killed one more innocent person? So what if I fall into hell? The Marquis killed my innocent son. What does it matter?She continued calmly, choosing to breathe for a while.\u201cIf I really wanted to take my revenge on you, I could have put you in the palace as the Crown Princess and slowly kill you day by day. But that wasn\u2019t enough for the two men who killed my son, as they wanted to make you the Crown Princess.\u201dThe two men meant the emperor and the marquis. In the eyes of the empress, unlike the emperor, the empress seemed to have lost her love for the emperor a long time ago. The emperor was completely deceived by others and killed his own child, which, in modern times, could be a reason for divorce.\u201cYour Majesty, would you mind if this girl said something?\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cThe girl doesn\u2019t want to marry His Highness.\u201dAt that, the empress changed her expression as if it was unexpected.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you love the child for a long time?\u201d\u201cWhat else in the world is as easily degenerated as love? Your Majesty knows that\u2026..I once thought it was worth all that. But now, I do not. I\u2019d like to cut ties with the palace if you will allow me.\u201d\u201cDoes your father know how you feel?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what my father feels, Your Majesty, It\u2019s more important that you understand my heart.\u201dThe empress narrowed her eyes. I needed to put on an expression that showed I meant it. I gave such a pretty smile to the empress. I thought I\u2019d never be able to break up my marriage, but now there might be a way.\u201cI\u2019ll teach her, ma\u2019am. Your Majesty doesn\u2019t have time to educate the child who\u2019s been overworked, does she? Furthermore, if you teach her yourself, she may draw a lot of attention and say something hideous.\u201dI touched the end of the teacup. Teaching Helena will naturally lead to more opportunities for her to be left alone. I had to kill Helena once to get to the end of this novel anyway. That\u2019s how I\u2019m going get the death penalty.The one thing that stood out was the difference between now and the original novel. In the original, Eris never taught Helena in order to break up with someone.Rejected due to causality, I had to ponder how to poison Helena.Watching my expression, the empress smiled at me.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re not a good match for my son. He needs a little more of an obedient child.\u201dShe didn\u2019t say it exactly, but I noticed it was a tacit permission. All right, we\u2019re over the hump. I bowed my knees to her and left the room. The empress only took another sip of cold tea without saying a word.I was trying to catch any maid because I thought it would be better to leave the palace before I say something to Helena.The mirror across the street caught my eye. Unconsciously, I walked in front of the mirror, and the witch appeared in the mirror and talked to me,\u201cAre you back safely?\u201d\u201cYou can manipulate people from nowhere you can\u2019t see?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean controlling? I\u2019m giving you an indication.\u201d\u201cJust tell me your business. We can\u2019t talk for a long time because we\u2019re inside the palace.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve found a way. Come straight to the store.\u201dIt was good news to hear. Since the palace was a place where I could visit if I wanted, I decided to find Helena next time and caught the carriage.Whatever the sacrifice was to allow me to return, wanted to do it. I just hope it wasn\u2019t asking for a human sacrifice. It would be nice to be executed as a witch, but no matter how much this place was in the world of fiction, my morals wouldn\u2019t let me catch and kill innocent people.The carriage soon stopped near the witch\u2019s shop. When I opened the door, the witch welcomed me as if she had been waiting. I went down to her shop and asked.\u201cSo what\u2019s the offering?\u201d\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201dThe witch was smiling as if she wouldn\u2019t answer if I didn\u2019t drink tea.I couldn\u2019t help but concede roughly.\u201c\u2026Ha. With milk.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring it to you soon.\u201dWhen I drank the sweet and warm milk tea that the witch brought, my body melted, relaxed. I began to feel sleepy.Unlike when I left, when I came back, I moved almost nonstop except when we had to let the horse rest. I dozed off leaning on Anakin as a chair, but I felt stiff.As I pressed my forehead so that I wouldn\u2019t doze off, the witch reached out her hand and brought out something wrapped in cloth.\u201cLet\u2019s solve it.\u201dWhen I untied the string, which was firmly fastened to prevent it from unraveling, a silver dagger with a garnet stuck in the handle emerged. The dagger weighed quite a bit, maybe because it was made of pure silver. What\u2019s strange is that it\u2019s a dagger without a blade. The tip of the knife was blunt, so it was close to decoration.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think I can open a letter with this dagger.\u201d\u201cBecause the dagger will be a sword that changes according to the will of the person.\u201dThe witch sipped her share of the drink and raised her hand. The sword that was tied back to the cloth disappeared.\u201cStab with that sword.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cWho else? The one the owner of the body is to kill.\u201dThe words put strength into the sword\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026Stab Helena with this?\u201d\u201cDampen it with blood.\u201d\u201cHow can I do that? It\u2019s a blunt weapon.\u201d\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? It depends on your will.\u201dShe smiled at me with creepy eyes.\u201cYou have to have a heart that you really want to killher.\u201dPerhaps I was relieved. Poison was actually an indirect way. Killing someone indirectly versus stabbing them with your own hands was different as much as heaven and earth.If someone asks what is the difference between the same murder, you can say that the determination to commit the murder is different from the guilt that comes after it.Maybe that\u2019s why people encourage others to kill rather than kill someone themselves. Of course, thebiggest thing is that you can create an alibi so you don\u2019t seem suspicious.At the same time, Helena\u2019s crying face flashed through my mind. When I was in a poor situation, I thought hated sympathy the most, but now I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for her situation.The last crying face I saw is clear. The child was shaking. She\u2026. was afraid of mePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There must be another way? I shouldn\u2019t have to kill her.\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly so weak? You asked for any way to return to your original world\u2026\u2026 Did you think that crossing worlds would be easy?\u201d\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201dAm I worried about her? Well of course I might be worried. Actually, more precisely, I was more concerned about my thin nerves that would surely break if I killed someone.Am I really okay to sacrifice an innocent person for my salvation? A question I\u2019ve never thought about now came to me.In order to prevent the destruction of the world, the sacrifice of a noble person is necessary, and that we have to bear it \u2013 it\u2019s the conclusion based on what had seen in the media so far.But is that really fair?Wouldn\u2019t I be resentful and unfair if I was in the position of being the victim?Helena will want to live. The girl with an optimistic nature and like a flower garden is a girl who firmly believes in each day\u2019s happiness\u2019, even if life is a little difficult right now. And she was the kid who deserved to be treated like that. Still\u2026\u201cI value myself more.\u201dWithout another word, I put the knife in my armsMy chest got heavier. Seeing this, the witch smiled as if she was supremely happy. She lifted her hand and floated her little glass sapper and sent it to me.\u201cThe other offering is tears.\u201d\u201cWhat tears?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI looked at Medea in bewilderment as she suddenly stepped out and grabbed both my hands.\u201cYou\u2019re smart. Find out for yourself what tears they are. It\u2019s not fun for me to solve everything, is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not doing this for fun.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that but I do it for fun.\u201dThe witch got up and pulled my hand. She slowly guided me to the door and arranged my messy hair. She opened the door and added.\u201cI\u2019m not helping you in good faith either. It\u2019s because of the situation you\u2019re in, and your actions are making it interesting\u2026\u2026. it keeps me entertained. I\u2019ll be your strongest partner until then.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t look betrayed. I\u2019m a witch. Well, that\u2019s cute, too. Bye, then.\u201dWhen I stepped out the door, Anakin was waiting for me. I didn\u2019t understand how she knew, so I just blinked, and the witch laughed and poked me in the cheek.\u201cI called him. We can\u2019t send Lady Mis\u00e9rian alone. You should have a knight to shield when you\u2019re kidnapped.\u201d\u201cThank you very much for that. Let\u2019s go, Anakin.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget, it takes that determination I told you to cross the world.\u201dAs I was taking Anakin out of the alley, I suddenly looked back. The lights were off in her shop before we knew it.I woke up in my soft bed after a long time and felt refreshed. Maybe it was because the maids washedme yesterday and gave me a massage. I changed into my outdoor clothes, smoothed my hair, and called Anakin.\u201cDid you call?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t give it to you yesterday because I was in a hurry. Take this.\u201dAnakin, who received money and a necklace of gemstone, made a face that showed he did not understand.\u201cBring it to your brother. It\u2019s okay to take a break at home while you deliver it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not worth this much.\u201d\u201cNever mind if it\u2019s not your money. I\u2019ll be locked up at home for a while anyway. Don\u2019t talk, just go.\u201dDamn, why can\u2019t I wear my pajamas when I\u2019m at home? I don\u2019t know if the aristocrats are aware of the pretentiousness of it. As I handed Anakin a purse and the necklace and went back to bed to lie down, Anakin\u2019s empty hand grabbed my finger.\u201cOh.\u201dAstonished, I turned around, and was even more startled when Anakin lifted my hand. He mumbled for a bit, I couldn\u2019t tell if he was grumbling or moaning, then his quiet voice asked quietly.\u201cWould you like to\u2026 go with me?\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cAre there any more things for you to do?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAnakin then subtly rolled his eyes. It\u2019s not noticeable, but it looks like it\u2019s restless. A man who isn\u2019t usually like that makes him look even more suspicious. I sighed and roughly pushed my hair back.\u201cIf there\u2019s something you want to say, just say it. Don\u2019t beat around the bush.\u201d\u201c\u2026I wish my master would go with me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why would I be alone? I\u2019m with the maids.\u201dAt that, Anakin looked at me quietly. Really? Those pale eyes asked me. I tried to respond confidently, but somehow my jaw and throat were clogged.I was planning to put my face in my pillow and cry alone once he left me. Without Anakin, no one will hear me cry in this mansion.A sigh came out instinctively. Why would this man, who doesn\u2019t usually ask for anything, suddenly behave like this\u2026\u2026 I touched my messy hair again and spit it out.\u201cFine, let\u2019s go, then.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cGet ready before I change my mind. If there\u2019s a lot of stairs, you can carry me and go.\u201d\u201cGladly.\u201dAnakin readily carried me all the way to his shabby house. It was breathtaking to observe his strength and stamina. Anakin knocked on the door and spoke quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201dThe door didn\u2019t open and the child\u2019s sly voice returned. Anakin glanced at me and urged quietly.\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me. Since we have a guest.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have any customers. You don\u2019t bring any street farmers\u2026..\u201dThe child, who was grumbling as he opened the door looked at me, covered his mouth with his hands, and screamed. Then he slapped Anakin on the back and hurried back into the house.\u201cOh no! I haven\u2019t cleaned the house at all!\u201d\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go in.\u201dWhen I entered the still shabby house, the child was hurriedly arranging, sweeping, and wiping things. The child shyly tipped his trash under the bed and clasped his hands together and asked.\u201cTea, would you like some tea?\u201d\u201cYeah. Use this.\u201dKnowing this, I brought tea from home. I raised my hand to stop the child from entering the kitchen and then raised my head to face Anakin.\u201cYou make tea. I have something to tell him.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dAnakin\u2019s answer and the child\u2019s scream rang at the same time. The child trembled and sent a rescue signal to Anakin with his eyes, but anyway, Anakin was my knight, so he walked past the child heartlessly,Abandoned by Anakin, the child was suddenly intimidated and looked down at his knees.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cPertil\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the name you made?\u201dSurprised, the child who had first blushed in shame, glanced at me and then gave his name clearly,\u201cKynthia, it\u2019s Kynthia.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty name\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m here to give you your hard work. I even put in the price of enticing Hubris, And of course, the price of silence is included.\u201dAt the sound of a heavy bag, Kynthia carefully checked the money in the bag and blinked his eyes. Kynthia\u2019s hands shook as he confirmed the amount.\u201cA-all of this?\u201d\u201cIf you think about it, the price of silence is the price of your life, so it\u2019s not that much money.\u201d\u201cThank you, miss! Thank you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll need to buy some sweets for the children in the neighborhood. It\u2019s not easy to have children to do what you want.\u201dJust in time, Anakin brought the tea, I sipped it and hung the gemstone necklace on Kynthia. Kynthia looked like he was about to cry. Oh, and I thought of one more person when I was obtaining the necklace.\u201cI need to ask you for one more favor.\u201d\u201cAsk me anything!\u201d\u201cWe need to save someone. This is also the most important thing to keep secret.\u201d\u201cSure, leave it to me. What kind of person should I save?\u201d\u201cA man who is well versed in royal court etiquette. He is currently not associated with the imperial family at this time. It\u2019s better if he hates the imperial family, if possible.\u201dI was born and lived in a republic, not a constitutional monarchy. I followed the etiquette from the book, but I had to be perfect first to teach someone.It would have been great if I could hand over my fianc\u00e9e to Helena, but I didn\u2019t want anything like that.All I want is a chance to use the dagger to stab her in class. If I\u2019m teaching a maid, they won\u2019t be too stricton surveillance, so I could leave the room whenever wanted. However, I need a witness who will see me stab Helena, so I\u2019ll have to call him back\u2026..\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take?\u201d\u201cA week is enough. I\u2019ll send you a message through my brother.\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201dKynthia took some coins out of his pocket and threw them at Anakin. Anakin skillfully grabbed it. Kynthia, who turned around, calmly ordered Anakin.Seeing that he\u2019s good at giving orders, it seems like Anakin\u2019s been pampering her on a regular basis.\u201cBuy some snacks and bread with it. Give it to the children as you wish.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Will it be okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll allow it.\u201dWith a quick bow, Anakin opened the door and left. Kynthia, who was measuring his footsteps, asked me a long time later\u201cHave you been laughing lately?\u201d\u201cNo, not really.\u201d\u201cYou look happy.\u201dKynthia had a relieved expression\u201cI was scared of you sometimes. You were like a doll controlled by a witch. You seemed like you were just breathing, I couldn\u2019t tell if you were alive or not\u2026..\u201dKynthia asked while tapping his fingertips.\u201cDoes he have a name, too?\u201d\u201cI created one for him. I call him \u2018Anakin\u2019.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name.\u201d\u201cYour naming was great, too. Why didn\u2019t you give him a name?\u201dAt my question, Kynthia shook his head.(N: The name \u201cKynthia\u2019 or \u2018Cynthia\u2019 is feminine, but it is a male child. He probably chose the name because it sounds pretty.)Note: meaning of Kynthia/Cynthia in Greek baby names is MoonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Believed that no one would call him. I said that having a name doesn\u2019t mean anything. But you know, there\u2019s no such thing as something meaningless in this world. My brother\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to put meaning into a name. It becomes just another loss if you get attached to it somewhere in the back alley.\u201dKynthia paused for a moment when he heard a sound, from outside. Anakin\u2019s feet were very fast. He did, everything quickly and came back.\u201c\u2026 Thank you for making it meaningful to him.\u201dKynthia smiled thinly. Although the two were not blood brothers, somehow his appearance resembled Anakin.There were times when she whispered love. And the days when she believed in the end of a fairytale where she would be happy forever.Melpomene sometimes thinks about what it would have been like if she had a different future. And when the idea came into shape, Kratos appeared.A man who was destined to marry her even before she was born and the man who will be buried with her even if she died right now.\u201cCome here, Melpomene.\u201dMelpomene refused his orders today. As she stubbornly fixed her gaze out of her window, Kratos strode up to her and pulled her close by the waist. He buried his face in Melpomene\u2019s neck and whispered softly.\u201cDon\u2019t make me scared. You\u2019ve made my hair white,too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s scared.\u201dMelpomene looked straight at Kratos. A terrible man. Melpomene didn\u2019t want this man to die. Instead she wanted him to feel so much pain that he wanted to die.However, she didn\u2019t want Kratos to actually die. This is because she knew the sadness of losing him would be more powerful than anything else.How did this happen? Melpomene started recalling the past.The first time they met. It was early winter.It was a cold day where you could see white puffs as you exhaled. The cheeky young Melpomene was walking away from the imperial palace, from the bonds of adulthood. Although there were no flowers because it was winter, the snow-covered garden had its own charm and was beautiful.Melpomene, who was walking alone in the large garden, suddenly thought. Are you going to run away like this?After today, if she enters the imperial palace, and marries a man she does not know, she will never come out again.Melpomene had a lot of things that she had not done yet. She wouldn\u2019t be able to see her mother and father often anymore. When she realized this, her heart sank.She would have to beg and plead her case. Once she gets out of this place and goes back to her home, she\u2019d have to beg and pray that she doesn\u2019t have to come back. With that in mind, Melpomene grabbed her thick skirt and was about to depart.Someone grabbed Melpomene\u2019s wrist.Her staggering body suddenly twisted into the arms of the person holding her.\u2013 Don\u2019t go.A beautiful boy with blond hair and blue eyes said so, She had met him for the first time that day. With a sad face, he held Melpomene and whispered gently,\u2013 Stay here. PleaseMelpomene recognized the boy who held her. Dressed in regal clothing, only few in the palace could come close or even touch his body.He was her age and he was her fianc\u00e9, the crown prince.\u2013 I can\u2019t stand this place.His desperate voice penetrated Melpomene. She understood. No one stays here because they\u2019re happy.Melpomene realized. Even those born and raised as princes hate this desolate place, but can\u2019t get out of it. That\u2019s what duties and responsibilities are like.Pity is often a feeling that can be confused with love. But Melpomene definitely fell in love with that wretched face while in his warm arms, unlike his cold hands.She was so happy when she had their first child, Laetatio, and when she was pregnant with her second child, Alecto, she had nothing more to wish for.During the day, when she confessed before Alecto had been born to the two people she loved the most in the world, even the sky cleared up like a blessing to them.Her best friend, who was introduced by Melpomene and married Count Antebellum, heard the news and sent her hand-knitted children socks. Count Antebellum also sent a congratulatory letter. The two became her treasures.If her life was a book, she thought it would end with sentences like \u2018And they lived happily ever after\u2019. Though it wasn\u2019t an exciting story filled with ups and downs, the soft and happy ending would still make anyone smile.But then everything changed so drastically.He allowed Laetatio to die in vain. When she held onto her dying son\u2019s body she couldn\u2019t even cry as her stomach contracted painfully as if it was tearing apart.Her amniotic water burst early, signaling a premature birth.\u201cNo, my baby\u2026.She couldn\u2019t lose both children in a day. In order not to lose consciousness, she grabbed the blade that Letatio used to stab himself.The servants screamed and carried Melpomene in their arms.The memory behind it flickered. But when she opened her eyes again, she could breathe a sign of relief when she saw her little child lying next to her.There was one more person in the room besides her. It was a white-haired kratos.\u2013 Why did you come in here?\u2013 You gave birth to a son. That\u2019s a great job.\u2013 You killed my son, and you dare come face to face with me?!Even in her fury when Melphomene threw random objects around, Kratos did not avoid it. Kratos stared at the child next to Melpomene with numb eyes. Rather than looking at his child, it was more like he was looking at non-living things like stones.\u2013 Now that you have this child, you don\u2019t have to worry about the successor.-\u2026\u2026 You knew that, right? You knew it! I knew he wasn\u2019t at fault, but you killed him without doing a proper investigation!Kratos approached Melpomene, who was still screaming. He knelt down and hugged her. As she struggled and rebelled, he had to lock her into his arms before answering grimly.\u2013 Empress, I wasn\u2019t interested in children from the beginning. You gave birth to him because you needed him, and I was glad that you were happy.\u2013 What? Now\u2026\u2026 Now that is\u2026\u2026.-I don\u2019t care if this child, just born to the Empress, dies. If I need descendants, wouldn\u2019t it be enough to sow the seeds of other concubines and then harvest them?The boy I remembered, who had been tormented by saying that he could not stand this place, had grown up quickly. Melpomene was terrified of his unfamiliarity. Kratos muttered as he kissed the corner of her eyes.\u2013 I only need the Empress to stay with me. All I need is the power to seize the Empress. To that end, I will even join hands with someone worse than the Marquis.Melponeme thought she should have protested then that day that she didn\u2019t like the Imperial Palace.\u2013 Don\u2019t even think about dying. Or I\u2019ll cut off the life of the girl you saved and begged for.Oh, she did. She still had three lives to save. Alecto, her close friend Clotho, and the Antebellum family\u2019s child in Clotho\u2019s body.Melpomene had to put up with it in order to fulfill the desire to stab this man in front of her with a sharp knife.Melpomene did her best to love Alecto, her only child left. Because there are only a few things left for her to love in this ugly palace.But as Alecto grew up day by day, it became even more difficult. Alecto looked so much like Kratos.Even though she was obsessed with him, when she saw Alecto, she naturally remembered Kratos and her heart was shaken. The more Alecto grew to resemble Kratos, the longer she kept away from him.Her empty heart was drawn to Helena, the daughter of Clotho, who is now Alecto\u2019s maid.The child was kind and innocent. Looking at the child\u2019s pure image, she felt like she was getting what she had lost back.That young self who knew nothing but love\u2026So Melpomene used to call Helena and talk. Listening to her story, Melpomene tried to forget everything, even Alecto.Melpomene knows she\u2019s a bad mother. But she couldn\u2019t stand it.She loved Letatio so much. She missed the days when she was with her eldest child and didn\u2019t know anything. Melpomene still dreamed of Letatio, who died.Then \u2018that child\u2019 entered the palace to become the partner of Alecto. With her father who took Melpomene\u2019s happiness\u2026\u2026.Melpomene looked at Eris, who greeted her shyly, with a cold look.It was unacceptable that the child of the man who killed her son dreamed of marrying his daughter to her other son.The harder Eris tried to become the crown princess, the more Melpomene did not like Eris.Clotho told her gossip whenever they met, saying that Eris was toxic. Coming from her, Eris seemed cunning and vicious, and a woman who was blinded by power, trying to entice the crown prince.Helena, who is kind-hearted, used to defend Eris, saying she was not such a child, but Melpomene thought that Helena only looked at the world so beautifully.Melpomene knew a child like Eris well. A vulgar person who doesn\u2019t know the subject and craves the power of men or by-products that fall in love with their own self-worthEven though Eris now treats her with a smile on her face, she must have inherited the shady side of the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian, who always looks for the chance to betray her.Melpomene constantly tested Eris. She intentionally rebuked her, asked for impossible favors, and insulted her by comparing her to Helena, who did not have the same status.This was one of those days. Pretending to be a benevolent mother-in-law, Alecto lied to Melpomene, saying that he had no interest in Eris and wanted to marry Helena.Telling Eris, If she keeps going like this, she may lose her position, so Melpomene wanted to advise Eris to dress up like a prostitute on the street and seduce Alecto. If Eris were to become pregnant, wouldn\u2019t Alecto look at her? Melpomene lashed out at Eris with her sharp tongue. Melpomene wanted Eris to cryBut she didn\u2019t cry. Eris just nodded gently and said she would listen to Melfomene\u2019s advice wholeheartedly. She may have been offended, but she did not lose control, like a woman who has already become accustomed to the Imperial Palace.Melpomene found it disgusting. She held onto her smile until she told Eris to leave.Kynthia: A boy who lives with AnakinMeaning of the name \u201cKynthia\u201d : In Greek Baby Names the meaning of the name is Moon.Melpomene: the current empress and mother of alecto, hates the Mis\u00e9rian family and the emperor because they killed her first child.Melpomene\u2019s name was derived from the Greek verb melp\u00f4 or melpomai meaning \u201cto celebrate with dance and song.Melpomene, in Greek religion, one of the nine Muses, patron of tragedy and lyre playing.

If there was a fault, it would be the marquis, but Melpomene was frustrated at herself for venting on Eris, who knew nothing.Melpomene had her servant take a look at Eris. She loved Alecto and thought it would be a good reward.Eris would have to go through the back garden to go out anyway, so she hasn\u2019t gone far yet.Maybe she will burst into tears when she sees Alecto. Women\u2019s tears always have an amazing effect. Pretending to be pitiful, maybe she\u2019ll ingratiate herself with Alecto.When Alecto, who had met Eris, returned to the scene, Melpomene asked Alecto.\u2013 Did she cry when she saw you?\u2013 She\u2019s the daughter of a snake, and even if she gets angry, she can\u2019t cry. I have never seen Lady Mis\u00e9rian cry before.Alecto laughed.\u2013 \u2026\u2026 Aha, ahaha!Melpomene burst into laughter. Having been unable to stop laughing for a long time, she gestured Alecto, out. She laughed so hard that tears were running down her eyes. As Alecto left the room, Melpomene stopped laughing and dropped her head, reciting grimly.\u2013 Poor thing, poor thing. You are living a very sad life where you are shunned by your loved one without knowing anything because of your father\u2019s sins. But / can\u2019t help it because I feel sorry for myself the most. No matter how unfair and miserable you are, you will never be the one who has been betrayed by someone you hold dear and lost a child you love?Melpomene didn\u2019t cry either. The woman who was tricked into murdering her child didn\u2019t even deserve to cry.\u2013 Love alone is not a place to stand.Love is more ephemeral than a season of flowers\u2026..Melpomene sometimes wondered about what it would have been like if she had a different futureOn that winter day, would she have been happy forever if Kratos had taken her by the hand, running away together instead of staying in the palace\u2026.?Sigh. Then, when Melpomene looked up in the mirror, what reflected was an old, ugly monster.Full of a sweet smell, Anakin returned with an armful of bread and cookies in his hands. He placed them inone corner of the room and came straight up to both of us.Anakin seemed to want to ask what the two of us had talked about, but he quietly stopped himself because Kynthia had his eyes wide open.Anyway, I\u2019ve achieved all the objectives. I got up to go back to the mansion. Anakin tried to follow, so I gestured to stop it.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve both met, so shouldn\u2019t siblings at least resolve it? You can come back to the mansion tomorrow.\u201dIt was my own consideration, but even before Anakin opened his mouth, Kynthia jumped.\u201cWhat are you talking about, miss? How can you go a long way alone? There are so many hideous people in this neighborhood that even those born and raised in back alleys like me don\u2019t go out of the house by themselves. Don\u2019t say anything else and just take my brother.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Master. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201dAs the both of them insisted so stubbornly, all I could do was nod embarrassingly. It was such a dangerous neighborhood, but I was suddenly worried about Kynthia, who lives here alone.\u201cWill you come into my house as a housekeeper?\u201dKynthia opened his eyes wide at the unexpected suggestion and shook his head with a smile.\u201cNo, my lady. Even though it\u2019s a gutter compared to where you live, this is my hometown. This place is quite affordable to live in. It might be more interesting than your mansion. And\u2026 you have enough loyal and good servants, don\u2019t you? It would be better if you let a rat go outside to bite the back of the horse.\u201dI suggested this because I thought that if he learned to write and grow up in a better environment, he would become a more distinguished child in many ways, but I did not expect such an answer.With the thought that it would be a waste, Kynthia\u2019s future suddenly became even more interesting to me. I thought maybe at least he would be the king of this alley.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for your call, Kynthia. Anakin, open thedoor.\u201dI\u2019ll introduce Kynthia to Medea before I leave here. was convinced that she would be very fond of Kynthia,On the way back from the carriage, I looked out the window and asked Anakin.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say no?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhen I gave you your name. You refused when your brother tried to name you.\u201dWhen I turned to Anakin, he came straight out and looked at me, as always. Instead of answering, he asked me back.\u201cThen why did you name me?\u201d\u201cI thought if someone would name me, then I\u2019d like someone who would call me by my name a lot. It won\u2019t be able to come out of my own mouth many times in my life\u2026\u2026. Other people usually have their parents who take on that role of giving a name, but I am an orphan.\u201dAnakin added with a faint smile.\u201cTruthfully, Master didn\u2019t have to give me a name. I\u2019m just telling you that I\u2019m used to my surroundings, which have always been, to \u2018use\u2019 me as if you were handling a convenient tool.\u201dAnakin reached close to my hand and hesitated, pausing, unable to even touch it.I was willing to give him my hand.He held my hand with both of his hands as if he was getting baptized, and held it against his forehead for a moment. Then he looked at me again and said,\u201cBut my master gave me the name \u2018purposefully\u2019. That\u2019s why I had a hunch that the master would call me by my name a lot in the future. My master always calls me by my name whenever she goes somewhere or does something. I think I\u2019m lucky to have you here.\u201dIt was such an undeserved confession. This is what Kynthia meant. Is it okay for me to give something so heavy and important?I can\u2019t call your name for the rest of my life. Someday have to give up the master\u2019s position and go back. The time we could be together was too short.\u201cIf I were to\u2026\u2026 What if I go back? What are you going to do with that name?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to become the wandering knight who the master said suits me well. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to shake off the name you gave me.\u201dIn the end, I\u2019m obstructing even your future. No, don\u2019t do that. I was suffocating. I felt like I was going crazy seeing his direct and honest eyes.Did the original Eris give you a name? What was your original name that she would have given you? What happened to you after Eris died? Will you survive if die? Will I be able to save you?I wish I had read more about you. I wanted to know your future. If your future was unhappy, I would do my best to prevent it. You, who obey my orders, paradoxically, are the only ones in this world who don\u2019t know the future, because you\u2019re the supporting actor for \u2018Eris\u2019.An invitation arrived from Kazar. It was written in a lengthy and casual style that he wanted to receive \u201cadvice\u2019 regarding a young lady\u2019s debutante ball.Kazar\u2019s young lady, is that Jason\u2019s sister? I couldn\u2019t remember at all because I wasn\u2019t interested at the time. I was just going to say no, but since it was something that I knew wouldn\u2019t happen again in my life, I thought it would be fun to go out once.\u201cTell him I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you write back?\u201d\u2026..I just smiled and emphasized that I would be humiliated if I got the grammar wrong.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of writing? It\u2019s more important that I attend.\u201dAs I spoke with all my pride, the servant seemed convinced and quickly disappeared. It was good that Eris\u2019 personality was so dirty that she could pass anything roughly. When the servant disappeared, the maids came in and asked,\u201cWe will get you ready right away, correct?\u201dI had an ominous feeling. I felt as if I had chosen the wrong option while playing a relationship simulation game. I had a hunch that my choice would be very, very annoying.\u201c\u2026 Right away?\u201d\u201cTime\u2019s tight to fit a new dress. You have to take care of your hair and skin.\u201d\u201c\u2026Even if I don\u2019t do that, well, wouldn\u2019t I be the prettiest?\u201dAs I replied calmly, the maid looked straight at me and smiled.\u201cOf course, you are the most beautiful. But we can\u2019t be satisfied just with your beauty. We want your beauty to dampen the spirits of other young nobles.\u201dUgh. The frank and terrifying answer discouraged me, rather than the others.The maids looked at me with their eyes already ready for battle. If Eris says no, they\u2019re going to force her to take it.I ended up nodding silently, and my arms were taken by the ladies and guided to the bathroom.My obstinate refusal has revived the \u2018excessive polish course, which I haven\u2019t done for a while. A bunch of maids rushed in, washed my hair, rubbed my body put on a face mask, rinsed\u2026\u2026 It was no big deal.Even while I was being taken care of, everything from hair to toenails, I was asked by the head maid to pick my clothes. In the midst of craziness, I chose a modern dress-like dress that is roughly loose and can be worn at once.The main game hasn\u2019t even started yet, but I was already exhausted like a butterfly flying across the sea.On the day of the showdown, I woke up at dawn even though it was an afternoon tea party. The maid told, me that I needed to be highly decorated, as if it was not already planned. She also said that it is more difficult and time consuming to decorate like that than to decorate with a purpose. Either way, they woke me up, and the maids made me sparkle.My white skin was very lively today, and the pale color of the lips looked milder and brighter.Eris was usually made up to look older than her age in order to not be looked down upon by others, but today the maids made Eris look at least 2 years younger than she is.I got off the carriage wearing a very light green dress with a bunch of ivory pear flower decorations stuck in my hair.Already, flowery young children and wives were talking in the garden when they saw me.They all stood up and greeted me when I came.The women of the Duke of Kazar were no exception. No matter how much the empress and crown prince hate me, I am still the closest to the crown prince.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though you had an adult ceremony a while ago, you look about the same age as my daughter, who is about to make her social debut. If she stands next to Your Highness, you two will look like sisters.\u201dDid Eris have a bad relationship with the duchess? Looking at the faces around, I don\u2019t know who they are, but they don\u2019t seem to like Eris very much. I looked almost like an uninvited guest as she showed her reluctance to greet me. That\u2019s why the maids decorated Eris up.\u201cLady Kazar has matured a lot. Don\u2019t the women of Kazar always grow up fast?\u201d\u201cUnlike the Mis\u00e9rian family who hold gold, Kazar is destined to hold a sword, so women must grow up quickly and be serious.\u201dBzzt bzzt. Lightning flashed from the eyes of both the duchess and I. We had been arguing the whole time, but there was no need to back down so soon. I looked around, closed my eyes and smiled.\u201cEveryone, please sit down. Come to think of it, there are a few people who are old here, so I think I spoke too long without noticing.\u201dThe women\u2019s expressions crumpled at my words.There\u2019s nothing as cheap as using age for an attack. However, it was necessary to be a little cheap for this situation.I was being subtly ignored. No one included Eris in their conversations. No matter how I tried talking to them, smiled, or responded to a question, they would not continue the conversation.I wasn\u2019t hurt because I didn\u2019t know them before, but I wondered if the original Eris in the novel was treated like this.I don\u2019t know if Eris had been hiding it because of her pride, or because of the crown prince, or that all of a sudden, these people looked down on her\u2026..I thought the original Eris was a pitiful kid who was easily judged by others due to her bluntness.Or had Eris always been weak against these socialites? Working like a servant only to be easily ignored and later betrayed.Whether it was the former or the latter, it was all up to Eris to be treated like this.In this jungle called society, Eris has two weapons. One is her position as the Crown Prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and the other is the Mis\u00e9rian family name.I know that one of my weapons is rusty due to the mess I\u2019m currently in, also I was seriously thinking about taking this opportunity to get revenge.\u2018If I were to become the crown princess, I would get even more retribution. I was struggling to not bediscouraged myself here as I\u2019m the one being bullied, but somehow they seem more desperate.I decided to close my mouth for a bit, and wait and see. As I was sipping tea and listening to the others, a girl who seemed to be of Eris\u2019s age spoke to me as if she was sorry.\u201cIf I had known Lady Mis\u00e9rian would be so bored, wouldn\u2019t have called her. Social debuts usually follow the mother\u2019s tradition\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Morgan, Lady Mis\u00e9rian made a great debut even though her mother left too early for her to learn from\u2026 It was very luxurious.\u201dAnother lady was quick to respond to the woman\u2019s soft jest. I tilted the teacup I was holding a little to measure the amount left over, and made eye contact with the girl and smiled.\u201cLady Morgan, do I look bored? I can enjoy as much as I want with just one gesture.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAs I blinked, the girl\u2019s face was blue when she noticed the still steaming teacup in my hand.\u201cNo, you\u2019re joking too much.\u201d\u201cDoes it sound like a joke?\u201dEveryone stood up in fright. The woman called Lady Morgan was almost about to faint.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian! Are you intimidating Lady Morgan?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of fear do you mean?\u201dWell, I laughed and waved because I thought I\u2019d frightened her enough.\u201cOf course it\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s because you seemed so scared\u2026..\u201dLady Morgan\u2019s face turned red as she listened to me. Another young lady near Lady Morgan spoke up for her.\u201cIt\u2019s because you have such a venomous and cruel personality, which is why you\u2019re abandoned by His Highness!\u201dShe seemed surprised to say the remark herself, but she didn\u2019t want to rescind what she just said. Rather, the people around her laughed and drove themselves into a mood of secretly sympathizing.I was going to think about whether to say that I was dumped or not by the crown prince, but someone put a hand on my shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for interrupting an important conversation but would you mind if I took Lady Mis\u00e9rian with me for a moment?\u201d\u201cOh, my Lord Kazar!\u201dI turned my head, and right behind me, Jason was looking down at me, grinning. With a sly face and a boyish voice, he asked the women of this group.\u201cIt\u2019ll be just a minute. I have something to tell her.\u201dWhen Jason laughed, the cold hearts of the women melted very quickly. They kept a straight face and said he could take me.He should have asked for my permission, rather than permission from these women, but Jason grabbed my wrist before I could respond and we left the garden. Then words came out from him.\u201cA \u2018Thank you\u2019 should suffice.\u201d\u201cWhat should I thank you for?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I save you from a difficult situation?\u201dI think having such an illusion is enough to be a disease.\u201cTo put it bluntly, you didn\u2019t save me, you saved the young girl. If it had been a little longer, I was going to pour hot tea over her face.\u201dHe smiled at my correction even as I was in a terrible, mood.Hot tea should have been poured on his face, not the young lady, as he shouldn\u2019t have brought me out. I was wrong\u201cAre you tired? I can lend you my shoulder.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dI turned away because I didn\u2019t want to deal with him. It was hard. This was because I didn\u2019t usually walk away from fights, but at the same time, I didn\u2019t like fighting either.But even if I, Eris, died, I didn\u2019t want to lean on him. I pressed my eyes while looking far away, and he talked to me again.\u201cDon\u2019t we have unfinished business? I\u2019ve come here for the first time in a while to be scolded by Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m one who just forgets if I can\u2019t point it out on the spot. So let\u2019s forget my business, Lord Kazar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do that.\u201dHere we go again. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s acting so sympathetic all of a sudden, and I don\u2019t really want to understand.I was just trying to ignore it and move on, but a word, from Jason caught my step.\u201cDo you mind if I tell His Highness about your mental illness?\u201d\u201cAre you really out of your mind?\u201dThere\u2019s no way he could spit that out without sounding crazy. I was so overwhelmed and speechless that I even felt numb.\u201cNo matter how great the Marquis is, the imperial family will not tolerate it. They don\u2019t want the blood of the imperial family to be mixed with madness.\u201dHow can he say something like this when he looks at me in a funny way? I wanted to flip my hair, but today my hair was fixed beautifully, so instead I\u2019ve been smoothing my forehead over and over again.Then she shook her head. I smiled and looked at Jason. Let\u2019s see. I didn\u2019t mean to lose that much to Jason.\u201cTell them if you dare. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s being treated like a madman.\u201d\u201cAlso, you seem to be mistaken, because I don\u2019t have any lingering attachment to the Crown Prince anymore.\u201dAt these words, Jason blinked slowly, surprised. This was a new reaction. So you thought Eris would love the crown prince even after all that humiliation?I wasn\u2019t saying this because I was the soul in this body, It should have been said that the love was over from the moment Eris wished to be gone from this world\u2019.If Eris loved Alecto, she would remain in this world. No matter how painful it is, she would want to see him.\u201cWhy do you look like that?\u201d\u201cIt was so\u2026 unexpected.\u201d\u201cDid you think I\u2019d love him for the rest of my life?\u201dIsn\u2019t that considered selfish greed? Expecting a woman to still love him even when he won\u2019t even look back. Everyone dreams of someone who will love themselves unconditionally at least once.Unrequited love and unconditional love clearly differ. Unrequited love can end alone, but unconditional love sometimes can\u2019t. If I met a bad person, I could have been tortured with hope. And it drives people crazyHumans don\u2019t want to love, but they want to be loved, and when they get used to the unconditional love they receive, they would use it recklessly.What if you know the other person is using you and you can\u2019t say no? Worst of all, why do this to yourself when there is someone in the future who will love you. No one should have the right to carelessly do what they like.\u201c\u2026 Lady Mis\u00e9rian has always been kind to His Highness.\u201d\u201cI realized that kindness cannot be called love.\u201dThis was something I wanted to say to Jason, too. If you really love Helena, and if you want to win Helena\u2019s heart, you shouldn\u2019t just be friendly. If he showed his feelings more earnestly, he would have a chance of winning.At this point, Helena won\u2019t love Alecto yet.However, this does not mean that Jason should show the darkness inside of him. It means to express his feelings with words, but\u2026\u2026To give Eris an excuse, she didn\u2019t try to express herself in a subtle way like Jason. She always expressed her affection directly to Alecto. Eris did her best in everything.Although I\u2019ve never been loved, I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u2026 even though it seemed to be stubbornness rather than love.Eric believed that time would solve everything. One day the crown prince will give up.\u201cOnce upon a time, I thought that if I continued to love him, His Majesty would turn to me. That\u2019s why I offered myself to be in the position of the Crown Princess. When I looked back at myself, I needed aposition where I could be seen. A place where I can wait for him with confidence.\u201dBut what Eris couldn\u2019t calculate was that Alecto was as blind as Eris. He had long been blinded by Helena\u2019s sun, so even if Helena is happy with another man, he will perhaps not turn to Eris.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that I\u2019ve realized, in my life, that he doesn\u2019t love me, shouldn\u2019t I break it up?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that why you\u2019re going to die?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it before, but Lord Kazar has heard too many stories from the minstrel.\u201dHe gave her a hard time, so if Eris disappeared from this world after suffering from love and hatred for the crown prince, I thought it would be all right.\u201cMy lifelong goal was to be loved as a crown princess. It may be a funny goal in others\u2019 minds, but it was as important to me as Lord Kazar\u2019s prophecy. What\u2019s the point of giving up on something like that?\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026.\u201dI said this, but\u2026\u2026. Well, maybe 1, too, misunderstood Eris. Eris could have simply been blinded by a desire for power.I wished it was the case. Wouldn\u2019t that be a better story, instead of this sad story of a child who is less than 20 years old who died after having a crush on someone for 10 years without being able to overcome that heart?Jason shook his hand and stuck out his tongue before making another serious face.\u201cI\u2019m joking. The truth is, Lord Kazar, think whatever you want. You won\u2019t believe me anyway.\u201d\u201cI believe you. I believe you, so tell me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust you. How can I believe you, Lord Kazar, who tries to blackmail me whenever he can? Threatening a lady with disgrace\u2026\u2026 isn\u2019t it too ugly as a knight?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so? Why? I don\u2019t know why I get ugly when I\u2019m in front of you.\u201dJason muttered with a bitter-looking face and tone. I didn\u2019t want to care about that, so I replied roughly,\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m more disgusted with the way you want to look good to me.\u201d\u201cSigh, I\u2019m telling you\u2026 I\u2019m ugly, but Lady Mis\u00e9rian is mean to me, too.\u201d\u201cI treat everyone equally, unlike anyone else. By the way, do you actually have time to care about me?\u201d\u201cWhen I step down, the next candidate for the Crown Princess will be Lady Antebellum.\u201dWhen he heard that, Jason had a strange face. Even though it was a very natural thought, he looked at me as if he had never thought of it. As if Helena was completely forgotten\u2026\u2026 and he saw me.I thought a lot about where I should get my etiquette education fromThe place where Kynthia and Anakin lived was too conspicuous to visit often, and I was worried that words would leak if I were to be discovered in other places.Inevitably, it had to be done at the Mis\u00e9rian mansion, which required the permission of the marquis,\u201cI found a teacher for etiquette. I\u2019m thinking about being taught in the mansion so that words don\u2019t leak out.\u201d\u201cEtiquette teacher? If you needed something like that, I would have taken care of it.\u201d\u201cDo you want to spread rumors in your estate? If the teacher had been obtained through the Marquis, the rumor would have spread within half a day.\u201dThe marquis was watching me, and I wondered what to do with the truth. So, I needed to be well aware of my surroundings. The marquis had many enemies. Even his current allies were people who would bite the marquis whenever they saw an opening.\u201cI\u2019ll bring them in, learn from them, take care of them, and send them out on my own, so just take care of the housekeeping inside the mansion. You\u2019re the one who loses if there\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026.\u201dI scrunch my nose before I went out and laughed as meanly as I could.\u201cSince the coming-of-age ceremony, I\u2019ve been like a member of the royal family. It\u2019s a bit slanderous? What if someone hears about it? Isn\u2019t it a \u2018practice\u2019 to be polite even if I\u2019m a daughter? I haven\u2019t learned etiquette yet, so\u2026\u201dAfter teasing him as much as I could, I closed the door and left. I could hear the sound of something being smashed on the other side. Hey, that\u2019s fun. If someone asks why I hate the marquis so much, well, it\u2019s close to those with homophobia.Ironically, the marquis and I had a lot of similarities. We were both very dirty-tempered, stubborn, ruthless, and venomous.The carriage finally arrived. I was really looking forward to who Kynthia would send me. Anakin guided someone to the door, who was thoroughly hidden with a black parasol. As the parasol folds, an old lady appears.\u201cI heard you\u2019re looking for this old person.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense even though you know whoam.\u201d\u201cThe older you get, the less you have to be afraid of. My knees are already starting to ache. If you don\u2019t have anything to say, let\u2019s go inside first. I have a lot to teach you so keep up.\u201dThe old lady snorted and staggered inside, using her cane. My handmaiden caught her hastily and led her into my room.Who is she? I glanced at Anakin. Anakin gently lowered his head and whispered in my ear.\u201cThe nanny of the dead prince.\u201dKynthia chose the right person.The former crown prince\u2019s nanny was knocking on her knees in my room. She looked like a good person at first sight due to her plump cheeks, but somehow, felt dignity in her slightly bent hooked nose and stubbornly shut mouth.\u201cIf it\u2019s Lady Mis\u00e9rian, I already know it\u2019s been a long, time since you finished your education when you were young.\u201d\u201cThere are several reasons. I felt that the manners when being taught and the manners in the position of having to teach someone were different.\u201d (TL/N: Eris has to teach Helena)The maid poured tea into my teacup, followed by the nanny\u2019s. The nanny savored the scent first and sipped the tea, then stopped at what I said.\u201cTeach?\u201d\u201cI have to educate a certain girl on the orders of the Empress. Do I have to tell you who she is?\u201d\u201cIf she is important to her, I have to figure out where to start with her education.\u201d\u201cLady Antebellum. She is the daughter of His Highness Alecto\u2019s nanny, and now\u2026 a low ranking maid\u201d\u201cHeh, what\u2019s a \u2018lady\u2019 in the traitor\u2019s family?\u201dShe snorted and drank her tea.Putting down the teacup, she lightly tapped her lap with her fingers and spoke bluntly, as if it was annoying.\u201cIf you have to teach a villager who has never been educated, you must start all over again\u2026 As you know, before I became the nanny of His Highness Letatio, was part of the education center for the crown princess. Because I was the Empress\u2019s teacher, survived the \u2018Great Purge\u2019 when His Highness died\u2026\u201dIt was the first thing I found out, but I pretended to not know.The nanny, who watched me, suddenly sprayed tea on my face as soon as she finished talking. The maid screamed as the hot tea poured down, dripping down my face. The maid hugged me and yelled at the nanny.\u201cHow dare an old lady who managed to survive by the grace of a time do that to my lady!\u201d\u201cThere is only one reason why I set foot in the hateful Mis\u00e9rian mansion. I came to see how the daughter of the man, who I want to be struck by lightning for killing another\u2019s child, was raised.\u201dThe nanny said bitterly. From my point of view, the marquis seemed like he would live a very long and prosperous life rather than being struck down by lightning. A thunderbolt is also dirty, so I decided to avoid it.\u201cStop.\u201dAt this rate, I thought that there would be a story that no one else should hear, so I raised my hand to stopthe maid and sent her away. She kept looking at me with a worried expression as she went out.\u201cWhy did you send your servant away?\u201d\u201cBecause I have to say something that shouldn\u2019t be heard by other ears.\u201dI crossed my legs lightly and asked the nanny.\u201cWhy do you think I have summoned you?\u201d\u201cIt must have been a shame that you forgot imperial etiquette. You wouldn\u2019t be able to ask anyone in the imperial family.\u201d\u201cWrong. Then there\u2019s no need to have my associate find you. Who did I say I was teaching? Why does she have to learn imperial etiquette?\u201dAt that moment, the nauseous nanny\u2019s expression became serious. I gently twisted my wet hair and whispered softly.\u201cHis Majesty and the Marquis do not know this fact. Only the Empress, I, and now, you, know this. I think what the three of us have in common is that we hate them. Am I correct?\u201d\u201c\u2026I haven\u2019t heard of Lady Mis\u00e9rian hating her father.\u201d\u201cWhat good would it be to let others know about a family quarrel? It\u2019ll be like spitting on my own face.\u201dAs I responded calmly, I could clearly see the nanny\u2019s heart fluttering. If I push a little more, I think she will be convinced\u2026I tried to look dignified. Like someone who believes in something.\u201c\u2026If I give up the position, it won\u2019t hurt the Marquis much.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take that person down on my own. So what is your answer?\u201dPlease come. I anxiously waited for her answer. If the nanny would teach me, I could wish for nothing more. It\u2019s not as easy to find someone with her qualifications and who won\u2019t betray me.The nanny, who had been thinking about something, took a deep breath and spoke slowly.\u201c\u2026Okay. Let this old woman teach Lady Mis\u00e9rian. Since we have to teach beginners, Lady Mis\u00e9rian also has to learn from the basics again. Don\u2019t think learning what you\u2019re learning is boring.\u201dWith the image of a strict teacher, she adjusted her glasses that were draped over the back of her nose.\u201cTeachers and students should respect each other, so in the future, we will address each other properly. Do you have any disagreements?\u201d\u201cThere is none.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll start teaching today. I\u2019m a pretty harsh teacher, so you\u2019d better be prepared.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 41The Ways of NobilityHer words that it\u2019ll be harsh were no exaggeration. She taught me six hours a day, and she made a distinction between what to remember and what to forget for Eris, who would be accustomed to the social world of noble ladies.\u201cThere have been some implicit rules in society so far. The placement around the eyes means I\u2019m interested in you\u2019 and the placement on the upper lip means \u2018 want to kiss you\u2019. These cute spots, tapped by fans, formed a \u2018silent social language\u2019. But\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe folded her fan and shrugged it off.\u201cForget those vulgar language, for the ladies of the imperial court are more concerned with dignity than arrogance.\u201dThere were many very trivial and petty rules.\u201cFurthermore, when you walk with His Highness, you must walk two steps back. You can\u2019t be behind him or ahead of him. When you drink tea, don\u2019t drink it too fast, and time it with the pace of the conversation.\u201dThe biggest problem I faced above all else when it came to teaching Helena was dancing, but to prevent words from leaking out, I had to even act as a dance teacher.Come to think of it, even though I should have danced as the main character at Eris\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony, Helena\u2019s aftermath was so great that no one said anything even if I didn\u2019t dance. In fact, the crown prince and Helena had saved me.\u201cThe ballroom starts with Polonaise. Minute is a form from the old ages. Second, waltz, Quadrille seems to be in vogue among aristocrats, but not in the Imperial Palace.\u201dPolonaise? Minute? Quadrille? Unknown names flew past me. At the very least, I barely understood the waltz. What if she asks me to dance? Realistic fear preoccupied the stomach. The teacher did not know my thoughts and continued to explain.\u201cWhen the atmosphere of the ballroom is ripe, we dance to Mazurka. When Mazurka is over, Cotillon begins to wrap up the ball\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s not just dance that Lady Mis\u00e9rian has to teach Lady Antebellum. You have to teach her the atmosphere that changes every time the dance changes and the conversation that goes with it.\u201dI didn\u2019t even know how to dance. I\u2019m sweating profusely, but the teacher doesn\u2019t seem to be worried about that.It\u2019s Lady Mis\u00e9rian, who is known for her social skills, so she must have thought that she would be taught well even without saying anything out of the ordinaryShe wouldn\u2019t even be able to guess in her dreams that Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s inner core is someone else\u2019s.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s start with the female choreography again to familiarize the senses. After the female choreography is finished, you should also learn the male choreography.\u201d\u201cMen\u2019s choreography?!\u201d\u201cOf course, you should also learn the male choreography. That way, won\u2019t you keep pace with Lady Antebellum? You, there, come here.\u201dThe nanny, who snorted as if asking her the right thing, called Anakin, who was standing at the corner of my room like one of my ornaments.\u201cYou keep up with me for now. Do you know how to dance?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve seen it many times.\u201d\u201cOkay then. Lady Mis\u00e9rian will lead anyway.\u201dLead? Me?! The teacher\u2019s eyes filled with anticipation reached me. Damn, what kind of lead is a dance lead? I\u2019ve been too busy trying to take care of my situation. In my heart, I prayed to God, no, to Eris, who had passed away.Please, when the song comes out, I hope this body will remember it for me. Isn\u2019t it said that if you dance a lot, your body will move on its own, even if you are unconscious?I roughly solved the language problem with that, sol hoped that Eris\u2019s body would do this for me too.Anakin put his left hand behind me, and his right hand, clasped mine. As the gramophone turned, upbeat music in three beats came out. And like a miracle, my body moved.I moved forward with one knee slightly bent and straightened to the beat, then stopped in the middle and circled around Anakin\u2019s still body. Then, following the instructions of his master, he circled the room once and held out his left and right feet alternately as if kicking lightly. After moving one foot to the right, unknowingly put my left foot back and sat down with my legs slightly bent.In the original dance of the past, the right and left symmetry must be correct. Polonaise is a dance that opens a ball, so fortunately, it was on the very easy side. It was a series of pulling and spinning.It was originally a dance where your partner changes throughout, but since there was no other person to change with, I continued to dance holding hands with Anakin, pretending to change partners.This became more enjoyable as my tension started to ease away. When the music that lasted for four minutes ended and I sat down with my knees slightly bent, the teacher applauded.\u201cAs expected of Lady Mis\u00e9rian. Now, let\u2019s switch positions and dance.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Am I also doing female choreographing?\u201d\u201cOf course you dance. So you\u2019re gonna ask an old lady who doesn\u2019t even have a good knee to dance? You\u2019re so ugly. Just dance as you\u2019re a girl and it won\u2019t fall between your legs!\u201d (N: yes, that between the legs.)\u201cKeuk.\u201dHearing this nanny\u2019s poignant words, I clamped down on my molars as I wanted to burst into laughter at Anakin. I felt my nostrils twitching slightly so I turned my head away.The most ridiculous of dances was the Mazurka. It\u2019s somewhat similar to Polonaise, but very different. Not only did I have to hop and hop with my arms outstretched, as if hoofing, but I also had to clap in the middle.Every time Anakin, who had never had a chance to dance Mazurka as a commoner from the slums, fumbled clumsily, the teacher shouted in disappointment.Watching him from the side, I almost died from struggling to hold back my laughter because Anakin was so cute.After the teacher left and I finished eating, I couldn\u2019t sleep even though I was tired enough to die. Because Thad to go back to the library, pull out a book, read it, and copy it.After reading and writing about ten or twenty books, got a rough idea of the grammar system. Still, it was fortunate that the letters, alphabets and the language were like a mixture of European languages. Like Tolkien, it must have been reinvented\u2026\u2026. I didn\u2019t even dare to learn.I squeezed my puffy eyelids.From tomorrow onwards, I had to go into the Imperial Palace and teach Helena. All I thought was that I hoped Helena wasn\u2019t stupid. Of course Helena is going to be stupid, but\u2026 I wish she was at least less stupid.No, is stupid better? So stupid, that if she makes me repeat the same thing countlessly, I might feel frustrated enough to want to kill her. The blunt knife Medea gave seemed to have become sharp for a moment.In one way or another, because I was so busy being taught by the teacher, it took a long time before would enter the palace. Although the imperial etiquette lessons were not over, I had to send Helena out to society as soon as possible, so I decided to start with the very basics that I could teach.I liked the feeling of the dark green silk fabric gently wrapping around my body. Today, I looked more like a tutor than a noble girl.As I am only meeting Helena to teach her, wearing an elaborate dress and putting on a bunch of accessories in my hair would be too cumbersome.So I tied my hair together with the same fabric as my dress, put on velvet shoes, and walked to find Helena. I noticed that the people who passed by me without recognizing who I was, suddenly paused only by looking at my outfit. With eyes wide open, they began to whisper.I wish light clothes would become fashionable. Though the clothes in this world are pretty, they\u2019re still close to the Victorian style. I thought I\u2019d die from having to deal with wearing multiple layers of fabric. The handmaiden, who had been ordered by the empress, led me to a suitable room. She brought tea and refreshments, and asked me to wait for a moment for Helena.Although the refreshments are too sweet, the Imperial Palace sweets are the best. When I ate it with fragrant tea, I felt better. I\u2019m usually not a big fan of sweets, but considering what will happen in the future, I thought it would be beneficial to consume the sugar for energy, as I know full well what is coming.At that moment, I heard a knock on the door. When I heard Helena\u2019s tender voice from beyond the door,picked up the teacup, rinsed my mouth lightly, and answered.\u201cYou called me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come in.\u201dWhen Helena entered the door and confirmed that it was me who had called her, her eyes became alert and she trembled like a rabbit. No, someone might think I\u2019m here to eat her. I haven\u2019t done anything yet and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s at this point. It is questionable how such a small child lived in the Imperial Palace in the original novel.Seriously, everyone in this palace seemed to like Helena, so I wonder what she was worried about. Even if I send her poison, the servants will throw it away, and if the enemies attack, the crown prince will, take revenge in her stead.There was no reason for this girl to get her hands dirty, for if she cried a little, the person who made her cry will be driven into a bad person and will never be seen again.\u201cL, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026 me, why me\u2026.\u201d\u201cHer Majesty has chosen me as the right person to educate you. We have a long way to go, so come and sit here.\u201d\u201cEducation?\u201dHelena still stood there in embarrassment, looking away, but finally, she staggered and sat on the sofa opposite me. I silently pressured her to sit with my head tilted as I observed her. I asked Helena, purposely not making eye contact with her.\u201cLady Antebellum, how much basic knowledge do you have? Can you read and write? How about ballroom dancing?\u201d\u201cW, writing? I did, but I did learn letters. I know how to read. I don\u2019t know what it means\u2026\u201d\u201cDancing? Do you know how to perform at least one of the dances like the polonaise, waltz, mazurka, or cotillon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, I didn\u2019t expect it. Let\u2019s start with writing before learning etiquette.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was only natural for her to know nothing now. Since she is a commoner, she wouldn\u2019t have been educated like the royal family. I asked a maid to bring Helena a wad of paper and ink pen and she nodded. Grammar books and children\u2019s books that children of this world usually use when they first learn to read were placed side by side.\u201cTake these home.\u201d\u201cWait, the reason\u2026! I want to hear the reason! Why does Her Majesty the Empress want to educate me?\u201d\u201cAsk that after training. Lady Antebellum is taking my time. Any more questions?\u201dWhen I responded by looking at the clock bluntly on purpose, Helena was unable to push any more and withdrew her body. From what I see, she needs to fix that first. Her posture was very poor for a lady who grew up only hearing that she was pretty. I hit the desk and yelled.\u201cStraighten your back! Straighten your shoulders!\u201d\u201cEek, yes, yes!\u201d\u201cOne of the most important things in a person\u2019s first impression is their posture. An upright posture rather than a bent posture is not only good externally, but also beneficial to one\u2019s health. And the gaze!\u201dI held out my index finger in front of her. Helena\u2019s eyes reflexively focused on it. I leaned forward and directly met Helene\u2019s eyes. I stopped her from trying to look down at her hands and then added.\u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t look away from their eyes. Look directly at anyone. Even when you are looking at His Highness or Her Majesty.\u201d\u201cHow dare \u2026\u201d\u201cIn the Imperial Palace, the servants are more like furniture. You have to pretend you didn\u2019t hear it, you have to pretend they didn\u2019t see it. Up until now, it was okay for Lady Antebellum to stay away from the nobles because they didn\u2019t have to talk to you, because no one\u2019s trying to talk to the furniture.\u201dIn other words, if you want to be treated like a person in the imperial family and aristocratic society, you shouldn\u2019t cower like that. Humans possess the bad habit of intimidating or pressuring down those they deem weaker or smaller than them.No matter how much the crown prince protects her, wanted her to know at least this one thing.\u201cIf you want to be treated as a human being, impress upon the other person that you are both equal. To do that, the first thing you need to fix is your gaze and posture.\u201dAt that, Helena blinked her eyes a little, then slowly came out and met my gaze. Seeing Helena with her waist and shoulders straight, I could see her cutenessflowing. Her walking posture wasn\u2019t too bad, so for now this was enough.\u201cVery well, let\u2019s start the class.\u201dThankfully Helena was smarter than I thought.I wasn\u2019t an experienced teacher so I had to start her with the basics, but honestly, she seemed to be learning quicker than me.At first it seemed this female lead\u2019s head was all stuck. The girl who could barely read children\u2019s books was now able to read even the most difficult collections of classical poems without interruption.The same was true of manners. There were so many trivial etiquettes that she had to memorize. Which fork and knife should be used for what food, guests should always arrive about fifteen minutes late and have to learn new personnel priorities.In my case, it was easy for me to adapt because came from a world where everyone believes that all people are equal, whereas she was born and raised in a society where the class system was taken for granted. I came into a position where I often received people\u2019s attention, and I was almost in a worldchanging shock. As I educated Helena, most of her words she spit out consisted of \u2018how can I\u2019, Tdare, and \u2018however\u2019.I even had to cultivate Helena\u2019s world view. Because this is a world that I had never seen before so I had a bad perception that everything would be good if it was unconditionally flashy and shiny.Eris was even taught which of her jewels are expensive, which color combinations to match, and how to choose her outfits according to weather or location. She didn\u2019t know that she wouldn\u2019t even have ten pieces of clothes in her closet.Damn, I think I should teach Helena how to ride horses, but I\u2019ve only gone horseback riding a few times on Jeju Island.I believed that the crown prince or Jason would later invite her for horse-back riding as a love event, sol decided to teach ballroom dancing first.To this, I threw off the cumbersome skirt and put on pants for the first time since I came to this world. Ugh, it\u2019s been so long, I couldn\u2019t get used to it.After I tied my hair up, I proceeded to greet her in her manly manner and extended my hand towards her, and Helena carefully raised her hand over mine.I taught her exactly what I was taught, but I changed the order a bit. The difficulty is there anyway and if she learns the difficult things first, she will learn the rest more easily and quickly.I taught Mazurka, Cotillon, Polonaise, and Waltz in that order, and Helena, who was almost struggling at first, showed a dramatic improvement. To be honest, in the case of Cotillon, it was a sort of dance that changes partners, so it didn\u2019t matter what happened when it\u2019s just the two of us dancing.When the waltz came, I and Helena were both nervous. Helena\u2019s close proximity to me seemed very burdensome as I estimated her weight to lift her.If I can\u2019t lift her, I\u2019ll just pretend to roughly hold her. It was clear that the crown prince or Jason who wouldlift Helena in the actual scene could fly her again and again without any difficulty.I put my hand on Helena\u2019s back, and she was touching my shoulder. Unfortunately, Helena distanced her hips to avoid contacting me as much as possible,It bothered me so I put strength in my arms and pulled her closer to me. Helena, who was close to me, gasped, and the sound of swallowing her breath resounded in my ears.\u201cRelax. The harder you resist, the harder it is to dance to the rhythm.\u201d\u201cIt is clo-close!\u201d\u201cThe waltz is such a dance. Come on, one and twoand\u2026.\u201dAs I counted, Helena froze. Perhaps it was thanks to that, for the long-awaited lifting part, I trembled a bit with a little difficulty, but I was able to lift her safely. It was fortunate that Helena was as light as a feather,Helena gazed down at me and her silver hair fell like a waterfall. Her surprised purple eyes were beautiful.She always had a pretty face. She\u2019s so pretty even when she\u2019s dazed like this. With this face, if she falls in love, how pretty will she be then?It is said that beauty can make fish sink, flying birds drop, obscure the moon, and make flowers bloom. Looking at Helena, the definition was almost understandable. Again, I twirled, leading her feet to the ground. Helena soon dropped her head on my shoulder and whispered softly.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m dizzy.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s take a break.\u201dMy feet hurt from dancing in my high heels. Helena asked as she sat in her chair and drank her tea, wiping her sweat with a handkerchief.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026 Do you intend to make me the Crown Princess?\u201dI was quite surprised that Helena realized my intentions.Indeed, since I am teaching her to be a noblewoman, no matter how dull she is, I thought Helena deserved to know.To be precise, the part that surprised me was not that she \u2018noticed\u2019 it, it was that she overcame the wall of pressure to get it out of her mouth.\u201c\u2026.To put it bluntly, the Empress wants it. Well, agreed.\u201d\u201cWhy? You loved His Highness.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised you would ask why. Haven\u2019t you realized that His Highness is behaving the way he does because he hates me and loves you?\u201dHelena responded with a breathless expression, and voice that looked like she was about to cry.\u201cTo me \u2026\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me. Do I love His Highness\u2026\u2026\u201dI started to laugh. Helena, who was whimpering silently, raised her head and stared at me with a shocked expression. She was brave enough to say those words but it seemed she felt ignored because I laughed.She blushed, biting her lips, unable to say anything. Maybe she was holding back her tears as usual. I gently reached out and brushed her eyes with my index finger, replying softly.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t need his feelings.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to tell a lie. Because I\u2019m not good enough to tell a white lie, and she\u2019s not young enough to need to hear a white lie.Now, Helena too needed to get out of her damn protected shell and hear the truth.\u201cThis is a political battle between me and the Marquis, Her Majesty and His Majesty, and you are nothing but a chess piece. Do you think I became his fianc\u00e9e because I loved him?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, really?\u201d\u201cSo naive. Life isn\u2019t a fairy tale book. Because the Crown Prince was the best fit for me. Even if I had loved someone other than His Highness, I would still have been engaged to His Highness.Curious, I asked Helena.\u201cDoes Lady Antebellum dislike His Highness?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dislike it, it\u2019s just different from what I wanted in a marriage! Marriage\u2026 I want to be with someone that I like.\u201dTheld back my laughter at Helena\u2019s pure twinkling eyes.If I laughed, Helena might really be angry with me thistime.So she wanted to be with someone she likes. Does Helena like someone other than Alecto?\u201cIs there anyone else whom you like?\u201d\u201cOh no, not yet\u2026\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s try to like His Highness. No matter who you like anyway, it will be difficult to survive unless it\u2019s His Highness\u2026\u201d\u2018If it was the crown prince, he would eliminate the enemy without anyone knowing. I think it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion, but Helena refuted it.\u201cYou mean Alecto would kill someone? Alecto isn\u2019t cruel and brutal enough to do that!\u201d\u201cOh, well, you may think that way.\u201dIf she regretted it later, it wasn\u2019t any of my business. In the first place, what reason could there be for why the male candidates for Helena were all so prominent?I think it\u2019s because the crown prince needs to be in a position where he can\u2019t execute people recklessly, so that he can survive and show that he likes Helena\u2026Helena looked at me for a moment and then asked.\u201cWhy do you want me and His Highness to get married?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 43\u2018Mine\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Because I hate his Highness. I\u2019m tired ofit.\u201dHelena\u2019s face twisted as I answered bluntly. She got up clenching her little hands and glared at me.Yeah, Helena\u2019s definitely going to be mad since she\u2019s human. Eris Mis\u00e9rian has been tormenting Helena for the crown prince. I would be angry too.She looked like she wanted to say something, but her tightly bitten mouth didn\u2019t open and she turned red.\u201cAre you upset? Are you angry?\u201d\u201cHow\u2026 in such a moment\u2026 just for that reason\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can change your mind. I have the right and the power to do that.\u201dNow I rinsed my mouth with the cold tea and looked up at Helena with a smile on my face. I\u2019m not sure, but it looked very arrogant.It was also intentional. I think Helena\u2019s desire to become the crown princess instead of me will go up in flames if she acts as a villain.\u201cIf you feel wronged, you learn. I\u2019ll help you gain strength by raising your status.\u201dI got up and pushed Helena back onto the couch, then went behind Helena and tucked her hair behind her ears.The two of us were reflected in the opposite mirror. placed my hand on the shoulder of a confused Helena and whispered in her ear.\u201cKeep in mind that once you have power, you can carry out your will, whether you want to take revenge on me or renounce your situation.\u201dI patted Helena\u2019s shoulder a couple of times, staring in the mirror, and then I reached out to her to teach her how to dance again. Even if I\u2019m mean, we still have business to do, right?\u201cIf you understand, let\u2019s resume class. I\u2019m not going to hear you cry anymore.\u201d***Teaching someone was quite tiring. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know it properly myself and I had to be careful not to make a mistake in what I taught.It was getting dark outside the window and I was about to finish class today, when someone knocked on the door.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian. Her Majesty is calling.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I was just about to call it a day. Lady Antebellum, class isn\u2019t over, please review what you\u2019ve learned today.\u201dLeaving Helena alone, I followed the servant chief. As he was walking through the spacious corridors of the empress\u2019s palace, he knocked on the biggest and most gorgeous door.\u201cYour Majesty, as you have ordered, I have brought Lady Mis\u00e9rian, the eldest daughter of the Marquis Mis\u00e9rian and the fianc\u00e9e of the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe empress had a tearfully noble face again today. She\u2019s noble and elegant because she\u2019s left all the hard and troublesome work to me. I folded my twisted heart and laughed. Imagine you have a boss. Be patient. Be patient.\u201cWhat did you teach her?\u201d\u201cI taught her basic greetings, dining etiquette, how to have a conversation according to the dances and the dance tunes of a ball, also an eye for choosing clothes and accessories.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s a long way from becoming a crown princess, but you\u2019ve managed to teach the most basic things.\u201dThe empress glanced at the maid next to her to pour tea. I didn\u2019t want to drink a lot of it because I got sick of drinking tea while teaching Helena. When I refused, the empress sent the maid out and said,\u201cI\u2019m going to introduce Helena at Kazar\u2019s debutante ball, what do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think it\u2019s the right time.\u201dIt was good to send her out as soon as possible, to a party with as many nobles as possible in order to make sure everyone had a good look.There were few families that could host a party of that size, and my coming-of-age ceremony was over, so if you missed Young Lady Kazar\u2019s debutante ball, you might have to wait a long time.There was a reason for the rush. Anyway, it had nothing to do with me. Because the empress was highly likely to entrust me with her education after that. It was also for a similar reason that I did not kill Helena yet, although I\u2019m with her.I have to say that there are still parts of the original novel left. Helena\u2019s beautifully decorated first appearance and being admired by people were the prelude to her love affair and marriage with the crown prince.It\u2019s been a long time coming, but now I remember. In the novel, Eris was not broken up with. It was only Helena who, with the permission of the emperor, became the crown princess.Eris could not even break her engagement, and she had to watch Helena marry her prince in her stead. So Eris in the original story went crazy and hid in Helena\u2019s room.Eris, who reassured Helena by saying that she was leaving to a foreign country, lured Helena by saying that she wanted to apologize for her misdeeds before going. Eris presented Helena with a poisoned teacup, and Helena was served tea with that teacup and drank it with Eris.Eris, who prompted Helena to pick the poisoned teacup, laughed frantically when Helena drank the poison and collapsed.How great it would be if the far-distant end could be moved a bit forward with this. I secretly sighed and spoke to the empress.\u201cIf you have nothing more to say, I\u2019ll be leaving.\u201d\u201cCall Madame and choose Helena\u2019s clothes yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026All right.\u201dNo matter how much Eris said she gave up, the empress was also cruel for making her choose clothes for her \u2018rival\u2019. Well, if Helena chose a childish dress, was in trouble, so I ended up saying yes.If I had seen my horoscope, my luck today would have been the 12th. I made eye contact with the crown prince on the way back. It was tiring to yell and get annoyed, so I tried to ignore him.Alecto held my wrist and turned me around.\u201cYou\u2019re determined to ignore people now, aren\u2019tyou?\u201d\u201c\u2026I guess I\u2019m tired and my vision has narrowed, Forgive my rudeness.\u201dAs I bowed my head gently, I could see the crown prince panicking. He paused for a moment to see if there was anything to pick on.Either way, I haven\u2019t eaten properly all day and I\u2019m tired from teaching Helena. No matter how young Eris was, her nerves were tattered and she wasn\u2019t particularly healthy.In a moment, I was dizzy and staggered, and my body went out of balance. I could see Alecto reaching outtowards me, but it was quicker for someone to grab me from behind.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dAh, this voice again. Why do you keep showing up? I angrily slapped Jason\u2019s hand off my shoulder. Alecto wrinkled his eyebrows and looked at the two of us.\u201cWhat kind of trick is this?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that and lean on me, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201dAlecto and Jason spoke at the same time. We looked at each other\u2019s faces as if we were surprised by the contradiction, but to be honest, I was just annoyed at both of them.Even if the two draw swords and fight a duel right now due to a difference of opinion, it\u2019s not my business, so I\u2019d like you to let me go.\u201cAnakin, come here.\u201dAfter a while, Anakin appeared around the dark corner as if rising from a shadow.Come to think of it, Anakin has seen both of them before. He must have seen Alecto at the inauguration ceremony and Jason in the Rundol region, but the former looked at Anakin as if he was wary of strangers. He was almost like a beast that had invaded his territory. Well anyway, I\u2019m going home.\u201cDid you call?\u201d\u201cHold me, Anakin. Your Highness, you don\u2019t want to see me so I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dThe crown prince tried to say something, but I didn\u2019t want to listen so I started first. Originally, winning first is an eternal truth.Anakin gently hugged me as usual and turned around, nodding silently to the two men who looked somehow dissatisfied.Leaning on Anakin\u2019s chest as we left the Imperial Palace, the gazes of the servants poured in. Change happens very quickly and naturally. At first, they showed a look of bewilderment, but after a while they displayed clear hostility on their faces.Even if you think she\u2019s not good enough to be with the crown prince, it seems you don\u2019t like Eris being in the presence of another man. I really don\u2019t know which rhythm to keep up with, but I decided to withdraw from the marriage with the crown prince.\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to hate me, say it as soon as you feel that way. Try to understand at least.\u201dBeing hated is not a very pleasant feeling. Still, wanted to show off in front of Anakin. I didn\u2019t want to show him a weak side.Anakin just walked forward without looking at my face. He replied quietly when a carriage was seen in the distance.\u201cHave you forgotten? I have already sworn allegiance and obedience to you. I said that no temptation or hardship would yield me.\u201dHe put me in the carriage\u2019s seat and knelt down. Just like when he first took the oath of knighthood. A purple necklace shone from his neck.\u201cIf you wish, I will add one more oath now. Even if the day comes when I hate you\u2026 I will not let go of you.\u201dI\u2019ve never had a single \u2018mine\u2019. It was the same with things and people. There wasn\u2019t anything I could do with ease. Because I didn\u2019t have anything handed to me, so I had to save and save.Now I know. Others might point their fingers at this thought, but\u2026 I needed someone to treat me carelessly. A person who doesn\u2019t have to worry about discovering this twisted me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I fell in love with my first love just because he saw me standing by the window on the playground and waved his hand, and my second love came by walking down the cherry blossom road together.When I came to my senses, I was soaked in love for the third time, and because we went through hard, times together, I held the hand of the fourth love. I believed that falling in love with someone dramatically was possible only in movies and TV shows.But now I find myself shining in Anakin\u2019s light brown eyes. The moment I confirm that he is completely mine, the gravity of the world rises upside down.I couldn\u2019t believe it, but I thought my hair would stand up straight. Because I am rich now. A tingling sensation climbed up from my toes and warmed my neck.I was afraid to hear my own pounding heart. But I thought I\u2019d like to hear it. Because the person in front of me is so adorable that I\u2019m going crazy.In the midst of my confusion, I somehow tried to smile. I can\u2019t check it because I don\u2019t have a mirror, but it seems to have worked. Because Anakin smiledat my face. It was hard to pick the words and spit them out.\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind, aren\u2019t you?\u201dHow could that be? Why are you so blind?\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201dI\u2019ve always believed that falling in love wasn\u2019t as big of a deal as one would think. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been living.\u201cNo\u2026 very\u2026 I like it very much.\u201dYou shoot at me. Just like the meteors who made the earth a long time ago.Like that\u2026\u2026 makes me feel special.Helena was restless throughout the class.Now that it was the beginning of autumn, I said she\u2019d make her debut at the Young Lady Kazar\u2019s debutante ball just before Thanksgiving, so it was worth it.Considering the period, there are less than two weeks left. This small wall seemed to come as a great burden to her.\u201cI\u2019m fine today.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dSince she can\u2019t concentrate at all, she seemed to be happy even though she was in tears. Anyway, looking at the watch, it\u2019s almost time for Madame to come.She greeted me, grabbed me as I was trying to rush out, and sat me down again.\u201cWhy, why are you acting strange?\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019s still work to be done.\u201d\u201cDo you have any other things to do besides class\u2026?\u201dAs soon as Helena\u2019s question finished, Madame came in. Madame walked straight over to me, not caring about Helena, and kissed my cheek to say hello.\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s. Seeing the young lady\u2019s beautiful face gives me inspiration today, I just made a piece of everyday wear that suits the young lady\u2026\u201d\u201cSend it to the mansion. My outfit is one thing, but today I called you to match this child\u2019s outfit.\u201dAt those words, Madame looked down at Helena. She smiled with a friendly face, but refused with a cold voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, young lady, but my clothes are for the nobility. No matter how beautiful this lady is, it can\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you allow my clothes to be stolen and placed on this child during the coming-of-age ceremony?\u201d\u201cThe situation was special back then. How could a clothing merchant refuse a royal?\u201d\u201cThen all the more so, you have to make her clothes. She\u2019s due to make her debut as an Imperial membersoon.\u201dWhile Madame was squinting her eyes and judging whether my words were true, Helena, who had been listening with her mouth shut next to me, was startled and waved her hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t fit my clothes! Leave, the price will be expensive.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the imperial court won\u2019t ask Lady Antebellum to pay for her clothes.\u201d\u201cOr I\u2019d rather go downtown and buy it\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Antebellum.\u201dI grabbed the gibberish-sprouting Helena\u2019s chin and turned it towards me. She never grew up affluent, so she knows better than anyone the embarrassment and pressure of receiving an unexpectedly expensivegift.However, politely refusing because they thought it was too much was different from being rude.\u201cThe partner who will stand by your side that day will, be Prince Alecto, a noble person who will lead the country in the future. You will stand next to such a person wearing clothes sold in the market. Is it true that you are wearing cheap clothes? Do you think the nobles of the city will praise you for your frugality?\u201dIt\u2019s not even New Year\u2019s Day, but it\u2019s either when you get too much allowance from your parents or friends you don\u2019t know, so you say it\u2019s too much.Even though she offered to prepare formal clothes when they were not available, refusing them because of pride or pressure was clearly a bit of a pity.\u201cNot at all. The nobles will curse the imperial family. How much tax did you collect, but you didn\u2019t give a set of clothes to your commoner partner to put on? Then who will be in the imperial family?\u201dHelena looked me in the eyes as she clasped her hands like a child being scolded. It is said that if she lives in the imperial palace, she will be able to develop her intelligence, which she did not have because she was afraid for her life\u2026.I didn\u2019t want to make her understand it in this way, but I can\u2019t help it because this is the most direct way. Wear a lot of frugal clothes later when you\u2019re the crown princess or when you\u2019re out inspecting the streets.\u201cMeasure her. I don\u2019t need mine. Because I didn\u2019t gain any weight or lose any weight.\u201d\u201cOkay. What about the color?\u201d\u201cIn purple.\u201dAt that, Madame stopped. She asked me, as if she was trying to make sure she heard me correctly.\u201c\u2026Purple you mean?\u201d\u201cYeah, purple. It goes well with that kid\u2019s eye color, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dPurple is the color of the Imperial family. It was considered a crime of treason for a person outside of the royal family to dress in purple. There was no way a lady who made clothes could not have known about it.Madame blinked her eyes a few times before showing a painted smile. And she said in a soft voice as if to match my rhythm.\u201cIt is indeed Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s perspective. Now, Lady Antebellum. Would you like to come over here, please?\u201dAs expected, Madame was good at living in the world. She was very polite to Helena, abandoning her attitude of neglect.Helena looked at me pitifully as she was dragged by Madame, but I roughly said goodbye to her with my hands.It\u2019s okay to make my clothes slowly, so I ordered Madame to make Helena\u2019s clothes as soon as possible.It was because she had to practice dancing while wearing a dress to prevent mistakes as much as possible, Madame smiled saying she would try, and she really kept her promise.Soon, the Madame, who had a haggard complexion covered with make-up, greeted her. Then, Madame\u2019s personal attendant followed carefully with a dressed mannequin.Helena was being washed on the \u2018minus time\u2019 course which was now in full swing. I know how painful the course is, but I had to match everything from makeup to accessories today, so I had no choice but to do this.\u201cWe still need to tweak the details a little bit, but don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a big difference in this outfit.\u201dThe collarbone and the upper part of the chest were brightly exposed in a rectangular shape, but the ends of the shoulders were tightly wrapped around it. The sleeves had seven layers, but it didn\u2019t matter since she\u2019ll be wearing gloves anyway. Along with the narrow waistline, the lower part of the skirt dropped in a rich and elegant curve.Above all, the beauty of her clothes was that they matched the color of Helena\u2019s eyes perfectly, as if she dyed her clothes in the light of the night sky just before sunrise.It was embroidered with silver thread one stitch at a time. The silver threads intertwined with the colorful embroidery and jewels like stars that shone with a mysterious color started light and darkened as it went on. It was a choice considering her silver hair.At the same time, Helena, who was exhausted, managed to come in supported by the ladies. Her hair was dry so I ordered right away.\u201cTry it on.\u201dAt my words, Helena, who had thought she might be able to rest a little, was dragged away helplessly again. I sat down on the spacious sofa with my legs slightly crossed.Shall we change the genre a bit?The same situation I saw in Pretty Woman). A cute woman was unfolding right before my eyes. No, in this case, is it (The Princess Diary)?\u201cChange her hair. She looks too old.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cNow go to Her Majesty and ask her to give you the accessories to wear with this dress. Be sure to add that she picks white ones as much as possible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go right away.\u201d\u201cNo, take off all those hair ornaments. Let\u2019s put on a tiara instead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201dThe servants were constantly moving at my command, and Helena was constantly suffering. A group of attendants rushed in with boxes of gloves, shoes and accessories.Helena looked at the crowd and her face became pale and blue. Helen\u2019s complexion wasn\u2019t noticed as the attendants poured out questions to me.\u201cWhat kind of shoes would you like?\u201d\u201cSecond from the left. Because of the height difference, it would be better to have some heels.\u201d\u201cWhere should I put the gloves?\u201d\u201cLook here. No silk in this color?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll look for it.\u201dThe empress sent a bunch of ornaments, mostly diamonds and amethysts. She picked out a necklace and earrings set, a tiara and a couple of headdresses, a ring, a bracelet and even a fan. Not too small, but not too big either. Because it is a place where the person, rather than jewelry, should receive attention.\u201cWell, Lady Mis\u00e9rian. She doesn\u2019t have a hole in her earlobe. What should I do?\u201dThe servant, who was in the middle of putting on accessories, approached me with a troubled face. Because it was a felony to injure the body of the royal family. Well, Helena wasn\u2019t \u2018yet\u2019 of the royal family. Even though she should have known that, she hesitated, because the servants of the empress\u2019s palace were very small.\u201cYou\u2019re asking an obvious question. Pierce.\u201d\u201cKya!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring you some ice in a little while.\u201dHelena, who suddenly had her flesh pierced, screamed at her. Her attendant comforted Helena with a sorry face, but tears welled up in her eyes already. However, her tears couldn\u2019t flow and she wiped them straight away. Because she still had makeup left.Her skin didn\u2019t look like she needed make-up, so her eyebrows were trimmed and new ones were drawn, and colors were added on her eyes, cheeks, and lips. Oh my god. The first thing I knew when I saw Helena\u2019s face was that her white eyelashes could look great if they were long and full.When she finally finished her makeover, Helena was literally poison to the eyes. All of the attendants had forgotten their duty and looked at her with rapture, Her makeup was darkened a little, and she had a certain dignity on her gentle face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 45Beautiful FoolI sent all the servants out and said to Helena.\u201cWalk to me.\u201dHelena walked towards me slowly, but with her back straight as she had been taught. The long dress might be cumbersome, but she didn\u2019t shake or falter.As she approached me, I held out my palm to her Helena bowed her knees slightly to greet me and lightly placed her hand on it.It was the last dance practice. Helena, who had become an expert at stepping in time with the beat, whispered to me.\u201cThere was a time when I was envious of girls in gorgeous and beautiful clothes. Not only me, but all the children who were with me. It was my dream to dress up like that and dance like that at least once in my life.\u201dBut as she spun around to my lead, she added with a somewhat bitter face.\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve experienced it, being beautiful is much more difficult and uncomfortable than I thought\u2026\u2026 this sounds like a blessing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dPulling her back towards me, I retorted.\u201cIt has nothing to do with beauty.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDecorating is laborious and inconvenient. People can be beautiful enough without decorating.\u201dHelena looked at me for a moment at those words, and then she fell silent in thought. We were dancing the same dance with different thoughts.Who first created the expression beautiful? What did that person see and say was beautiful? Was it a person or a landscape? Or\u2026\u2026 what kind of thing was it?How much more should we be swept away by the standards of beauty that change with the flow of time?The ball was just around the corner, so rather than teaching something new, I was reviewing what she had learned so far so as to not make a mistake. It was because the amount taught was so vast that it was easily forgotten or confused.As the debutante ball approached, the nerves of Helena became sharper.\u201cI\u2019ve prepared refreshments. May I come in for a moment?\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe reason why we were not exploding was because there was a snack time that came out every now and then. If you take a rest while eating sweet snacks, you think about it again just before you are about to say harsh things.It was for that reason that I shoved a horribly sweet Imperial Palace snack into my mouth, regardless of my taste. It was a sugar high.The attendants were busy carrying tea and refreshments and displaying them on the table. Usually, to save face, I put them in my mouth until the servants stopped displaying it and left, but today, perhaps because I was particularly tired, I unknowingly laid my hands on the sweets. I picked up a mille feuille and took a bite, but it was like chewing, sand.At first, I thought it was just the texture of the pastry, but the more I rolled my tongue, the clearer it was that it did not melt.I lifted my eyes slightly and looked at Helena and saw that she was eating it deliciously without any change in expression. Who was the culprit?Firstly, I casually took another bite of the sandy mille feuille. As I walked out the door, there was a child who slightly glanced at me. She was the one who put the sweets in front of me. I slowly lifted my finger.\u201cThere you are, come here.\u201d\u201cYes? Me, me?\u201d\u201cYeah, you.\u201dI stood up slowly, waiting for the child I pointed at to come closer.Looking down closely, I remembered who it was.She was the kid who pushed me to the crown prince.The child pretended to be calm, but kept staring at Helena from the corner of her eye. You have faith in something, don\u2019t you?As the child stood in front of me, I raised my arm high and slapped her in the face without mercy. At the same time as the ear-piercing sound, the skinny child fell to the floor without even screaming. The servants turned their heads in acknowledgment.\u201cStand up.\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian!\u201dAt my command, the servants grabbed the child\u2019s arms and made her stand up. Surprised, Helena stood up and approached me. With the child\u2019s wrist held, she tried to resist stopping, and I said.\u201cWatch carefully. For when you become the Crown Princess. I will teach you how to deal with those who disrespect and mess with you.\u201d\u201cMiss Helena!\u201dAs the servant stared at Helena, 1 slapped her opposite cheek immediately. I hit it so hard that my hands were tingling. The servants brought up the child who stumbled and fell. I grabbed the child\u2019s chin, whose cheeks were swollen red, and said,\u201cI don\u2019t blame children. What do children know? Children learn and grow from their mistakes. When a child makes a mistake, it is the responsibility of the adult who taught them wrong.\u201dAs I leaned down to meet her eyes, the child trembled and looked straight at me without averting her gaze. Either way, I gently stroked the child\u2019s cheeks and continued.\u201cWhy do you look down on me and chase Lady Antebellum? Because she\u2019s nice to you? Or because you\u2019re more scared of me? No, no\u2026 you\u2019re looking behind Lady Antebellum. You\u2019re being so arrogant to me because Her Majesty has her back.\u201dIn my school days, I hated the so-called \u2018Type of Person Who Sticks Next to a Good Girl and Shouts Loudly\u2019.This is because there is no sense of loyalty between followers who seek to gain something from you. They used to pretend to be close to those that were better than them, but when it reduced, they would change their attitudes and betray them.Such was this child. Had Helena not been loved by Alecto, would this child have done such a big thing like this? No way. This child wasn\u2019t really following Helena from her heart.Just like the crown prince believed in her words and slapped me on the cheek, she was just enjoying the \u2018supreme power\u2019 that came from the by-product of someone\u2019s love and hatred. (QC/N: cross reference to chapter 2.)How fun would that be? With one simple word from you, your naughty boss gets screwed.\u201cYou know, I forgive children for everything, but knowing the advantage of power and weighing it\u2026 That\u2019s not the way a child should think.\u201dHelena grabbed my wrist and stopped me as I raised my hand to hit her cheek again. As she looked at me without a word, she spoke stern words, trembling.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Let me tell you, it\u2019s your responsibility that this kid is so arrogant.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s my responsibility, so stop hitting her.\u201dBeing nice is a disease at this point. Is it an angel complex or what? There is a stark difference between being nice and being a good person, but when there is such a person, it is the people around them who are upset rather than the person involved. It\u2019s not like can develop her eye for people\u2026.\u201cHaa, Lady Antebellum. Judge the people around you. Make sure you know if they are on your side because they really like you, or if they\u2019re on your side because they want to rip you off.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to nibble on it. It\u2019s okay to eat it. So\u2026\u201dThe trembling stopped. Even the fear that often remained on her face was erased. Just as a person who had made up their mind usually does, there was only clear determination on her dazzling face.\u201cDon\u2019t recklessly use violence against anyone. If you don\u2019t feel good, you\u2019re welcome to slap me on the cheek today. But promise me you\u2019ll never raise your hand again after today.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you dare to advise me?\u201d\u201cOn that day, the day Lady Mis\u00e9rian foolishly left what was right for His Highness, I swore to God that I wouldnever make the same mistake again. No reason can justify violence.\u201dHelena whispered in a suppressed voice.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian told me.\u201dI narrowed my eyes and looked at Helena. Maybe Helena is attacking me because she has \u2018power\u2019, or maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have as much power as her prince.Then I laughed at myself.This damn sense of inferiority was like a seizure every now and then. I knew better than anyone that Helena could not be such a great person. Because I am the only person in the world who had looked into her brain.Helena bit her lip and looked down at the child.\u201cThere should be a more reasonable punishment rather than violence.\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll tell the maid to let this child go.\u201d\u201cMiss Helena! No! I made a mistake. If I am punished, I\u2019d stand it. I\u2019d rather be beaten! But please don\u2019t kick me out!\u201dThe child crawled and clung to Helena\u2019s feet, but Helena was waiting for my permission without looking down until the end. How can the difference be from one to ten? I was a little surprised.I have rarely endured it because I have a bad personality. Talking back was normal, and if I was hit by someone, I had to double it with my own hands to relieve my anger.I didn\u2019t mind being blamed for being immoral. From my experience, morality usually does not solve injustice.When I was hit by the crown prince, I honestly tried to hit him the same. He tried to run away quickly, which was why he stopped talking.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dIf you\u2019re more afraid of being kicked out than being hit, you should. The child screamed and was caught by the attendants and dragged away.Watching this, I prepared to go back. I felt dirty and didn\u2019t want to stay here any longer.\u201c\u2026.Should I eat it all?\u201dYou\u2019re the only one who\u2019s good. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s elegant, and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s clean. Did I tell you? This is ridiculous. It\u2019s just by nature. You\u2019re a fool by nature, and I\u2019m mean and give you a different answer.Anyone can tell it\u2019s childish. I am angry because I am ashamed of myself for rationalizing that I am not a child because I am clever.\u201cThose who love you will be sad to hear that statement, Helena Antebellum.\u201dI\u2019m sick of your self-sacrifice. Even more so knowing your sincerity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ingredients?\u201dAs soon as I arrived at the mansion, I ordered the attendant who greeted me. The servant asked me as if he was embarrassed by my sudden words.\u201cYes, anything is good, so bring out whatever you want.\u201d\u201cThe amount\u2026. How much do you need?\u201d\u201cWell. About 4 servings.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll put it in a box so you can take it out.\u201dThe servant quickly disappeared. I pressed on my temple, which was starting to throb, and called Anakin out, then told him to pick up the box that the servant gave me.Even when I rode a carriage into a familiar alley, Anakin never asked why I was suddenly going to Kynthia\u2019s house. So I was thankful.We knocked on Kynthia\u2019s door without saying a word. Kynthia angrily came out and screamed again asking about what else was going on. It was somehow a familiar sight. Ignoring whether Kynthia cleared the house or not, we went inside and put our luggage down.\u201cHey, at this hour, what\u2026 for what reason. Do you have any urgent business?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the mirror?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a mirror, go to the bathroom\u2026 No, what\u2019s with all this luggage?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cooking ingredients.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that? I have eyes too?\u201dI could hear Kynthia and Anakin talking to each other from the bathroom. Will the sound reach the witch? I looked in the mirror and called the now familiar name\u201cMedea.\u201dHow long has it been? Her figure was clearly reflected in the mirror. Medea, whose red hair was dripping down like a waterfall, laughed with a teddy bear in her hand.\u201c\u2026Anything happened?\u201d\u201cYou know where I am, right? Come here. I\u2019ll entertainyou.\u201d\u201cOh, my God, you\u2019re so confident. What if I don\u2019tcome?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be here. There\u2019s a kid I want to introduce toyou.\u201dI left the bathroom and entered the kitchen. I asked him to light a fire in the oven and take out the ingredients. At this point, it seemed that there were only a few ingredients needed.In fact, they were such fresh and high-quality ingredients so I was glad that they would be delicious just by roasting and boiling.\u201cDo you want me to cook? How can you do such a humble thing with your own hands\u2026\u201d\u201cKitchen work is not a low job. It\u2019s not that lowly people do kitchen work. All humans die if they don\u2019t eat, so how can labor to feed someone be lowly? Everywhere you go, traders don\u2019t starve.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, stranger.\u201d\u201cStranger?\u201dThe witch hit the door open by herself and came in She alternated her gaze between me and Kynthia, who looked at the witch with his mouth wide open and then covered his mouth slightly.\u201cOh my god, was this still a secret?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just have to be honest. Kynthia, this is the witch helping me. Medea, this is Anakin\u2019s younger brother, Kynthia.\u201d\u201cA witch?!\u201d\u201cAnyway, she has a bad personality\u2026 but I prefer that more.\u201d\u201cW, witch\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you trying to show me this kid?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, isn\u2019t he fun? I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll get bored after I cross over.\u201d\u201cBe kind.\u201dKynthia hid behind Anakin without realizing. He gently slipped out like a cat with a lot of fur and stared at the both of us without saying a word.Anakin glanced at me. The witch tilted her head and looked at us, more precisely, at Kynthia who was wary of Medea, then she laughed.\u201cHey, do you think I\u2019m going to eat you?\u201d\u201cThe book says you do eat.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of eating a child without flesh?\u201d\u201cThe meat is tender.\u201dAt that, Medea laughed with her head up. She thinks it\u2019s because he\u2019s cute, but Kynthia was terrified by the \u2018witch\u2019s laughter and hid behind Anakin\u2019s back.\u201cDo you eat chicks because the meat is tender? It\u2019s better to fatten up, raise a chicken then eat it.\u201dAt this rate, I stopped Medea because I thought the child would cry.\u201cDon\u2019t lie. You don\u2019t eat people.\u201d\u201cOh, my God, you got me.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t believe it anyway.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying. You were scared.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s scary. They don\u2019t even eat it, but they kill it.\u201dKynthia mumbled in a small voice. Medea straightened her hair by twisting it slightly.\u201cI don\u2019t kill anymore. I\u2019ve already killed enough to get tired of it.\u201d\u201cMedea.\u201d\u201cOkay. Is this the kid you like? Okay. So, kid, what do you believe in? God?\u201dKynthia answered by stepping away from Anakin\u2019s back and looking straight at Medea.\u201cNo, myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right. He\u2019s really bright and funny.\u201d\u201cTake care of yourself.\u201dAfter hearing his answer, the witch turned to me and she answered with a smile. I raised my eyebrows slightly. Medea watched me prepare the dish, shrugged her shoulders and added.\u201cAfter I possessed this body, I didn\u2019t really need to eat anything, so I forgot how to cook. Well, do you want me to taste it for you?\u201dThen she said, ah, and opened her mouth. Ugh, I hate her less if she doesn\u2019t say anything.I tried to play a trick by putting my finger in her mouth and holding it in.I want to eat home-cooked meals, but there\u2019s nothing I can make. To make kimchi stew or soybean paste stew, there is no kimchi and soybean paste, and to make stir-fry spicy pork, there is no red pepper paste\u2026..Kynthia and Anakin, who noticed, sneakily stuck to my side. They kept wanting to do something so I asked them to cut potatoes first.While looking through popular ingredients, I thought ! could make sujebi with potatoes, so I added water on it, put the anchovy-like things in and boiled the broth.I handed Anakin, who had cut the potatoes, a measurement to make dough and knead it, then put the potatoes in the broth and cut carrots, zucchini, green onions and onions.As I roughly took a handful of Anakin\u2019s dough, thought about it: there is no soy sauce among the seasonings. Garlic is fine if you roughly mince it, but I don\u2019t know if it will taste better if you season it with salt instead of soy sauce.Phew, it\u2019s hard enough to do in other countries, but it was a nonsensical dream to come to a different world and cook Korean food. If you want to cook a dish that does not require much seasoning, you need to boil beef bone soup, which is enough with just bones, but if I do that, you won\u2019t be able to eat dinner tonight.\u2018If it doesn\u2019t taste good, I\u2019ll eat it all by myself. While boiling sujebi, Anakin was asked to grill meat as a backup. If sujebi fails, we\u2019ll fill our stomachs with meat.After seasoning it with salt and boiling it, I thought it smelled good, so I put the pot on the table. Everyone looked at the unfamiliar food inside the pot.I think I\u2019m a little more disappointed with the simple visual than I thought. I put roughly one ladle in a bowl at a time.\u201cIt\u2019s food from a different world, so\u2026\u2026 Just taste it, let\u2019s say it\u2019s an interesting experience.\u201dI ate it first, hmm\u2026. I was happy because it tasted like homemade soup. It just tasted like the sujebi I made at home.I was worried because the color of the soup was a bit too milky-white, maybe it\u2019s because there was no soy sauce.Other people\u2019s reactions were just mediocre. I am a little reluctant to say that the texture of sujebi was strange, but I think it\u2019s a kind of soup that warms the body. It wasn\u2019t wrong. I cooked it because I wanted to eat something hot.There was no conversation, but no one at this table felt uncomfortable. So it was good. In this world where there are only people who hate me, I also wanted to be surrounded by people who liked me at least once.A time when I don\u2019t have to worry about what this person is thinking inside, whether they are holding hostility towards me\u2026.. I wanted to\u2026Actually, I just wanted to say thank you.I wanted to say that I am glad that I met you and that you were on my side.But when I put the words together, I was embarrassed and my mouth wouldn\u2019t open. Instead, I cooked. Because sharing a meal with someone should not be forced, it should be based on very basic goodwill.I folded all the words I wanted to say, chewed the juicy meat and swallowed it with warm broth. I wanted them to feel these stifling feelings in my stomach. Whether they knew my wish or not, everyone emptied the bowls.\u201cI really enjoyed the meal.\u201dFor the first time since I came to this world, I didn\u2019t feel bloated while eating a meal.Young Lady Kazar\u2019s social debut was just around the corner. There had been no correspondence from the Imperial Palace yet.Don\u2019t tell me I have to send a letter directly to the crown prince and stab him in the ribs by telling him to use Helena as his partner? Please, I have no choice but to believe that the empress would have spoken to the fullest of her knowledge.I haven\u2019t taught Helena for the past few days in order to minimise talking to her as much as possible. Now! had to get an outfit ready to wear to the debutante. I was already exhausted mentally and physically due to how nerve wracking it was going to be this time.\u201cLady, Madame has sent you clothes.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201dThe servant came in carrying a large box. Madame usually comes to check if the size was correct, but seeing that this is the only attendant, she seemed to be busy with Helena\u2019s clothes.If it was Eris, she would have run wild saying that she was ignored, but from the modern point of view, it was rather pitiful for Madame to have to stay up all night while making clothes by hand.\u201cMadame has sent you a letter apologizing for not being able to visit in person.\u201dEven sending a letter? After doing something, I read it and found a short letter written in a very elegant and beautiful cursive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 47JaneTo Lady Mis\u00e9rian.The cold season has arrived. Are you wearing the coat / sent you last time? I\u2019m just apologising for not being able to meet you in person because I\u2019m having a busy day due to the debutante ball.Please relieve your anger. I promised myself that I would make the lady\u2019s first and last clothes with my own hands./ have always remembered that my biggest customer and muse is only Lady Mis\u00e9rian. Please wear this dress and shine as usual at the debutante ball.Your faithful Twal Rose.When I untied the silk laces and opened the box, found a beautiful dress like a dream.A rich off-shoulder dress, naturally ruffled with countless layers of pale pink tulle, was draped with hundreds of silk flowers as it went down. Delicate lace adorned the layers, and patterns were embroidered between the flowers with silver and precious stones.It was a waste to simply attach the rhetoric of \u2018pretty\u2019. When I see a work of art in real life, I feel intimidated, and this dress was just that. The maids barely let out the breath they were holding. While smothering the clothes, I listened to them as they made a fuss and praised Madame.Just by looking at it, I could feel that more effort was put in this dress than in Helena\u2019s clothes. If it was pretty, I liked it. Now, or when, won\u2019t you like to try on a pretty dress you can only see at a Paris collection show?However, from the Madame\u2019s point of view, Eris was like a kite that had already fallen off the string, yet she put so much effort into it.I wanted to know if there was something behind the scenes, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out. In the original work, Madame was only treated as one of the tools to express Eris\u2019 influence in the social circle, because later, even Madame was passed on to Helena.Oh, come to think of it, I had to get a men\u2019s suit. Because I decided to take Anakin as my partner instead of the prince. But Madame seemed to specialize in women\u2019s wear, so I was thinking about whether to take Anakin to a men\u2019s clothing store.\u201cI\u2019m coming in.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in. I\u2019m going out again.\u201dSpeaking of which, Anakin knocked on the door so! told the ladies to keep the dress safe and opened the door. While standing in front of me, I roughly assessed Anakin\u2019s clothes and said,\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should wear a nice suit to the debutante ball?\u201d\u201c\u2026If you\u2019re talking about my clothes, you don\u2019t have to buy them. Because there are uniforms.\u201d\u201cA uniform\u2026\u2026?\u201dWas there anything like that? Anakin calmly addressed the story for the first time.\u201cI was wearing it at the ceremony as well.\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026 huh?\u201dI can\u2019t remember anything during that time because wasn\u2019t particularly interested in Anakin.Hmmmm. I was embarrassed so I coughed meaninglessly and retorted.\u201cI was going to buy you expensive clothes that you can\u2019t ever buy with your salary, so why don\u2019t you pretend you didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cA uniform is enough. No matter how expensive it is, it will be less honorable than a uniform that will prove, I\u2019m my master\u2019s knight.\u201dHow can every word you say be so pretty? Excited, I was patting Anakin\u2019s cheek lightly, but the servant came running from afar so I paused.The servant, who was sweating profusely, looked at me and Anakin in turn without saying a word.\u201cI, there\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cLord K-Kazar wants to meet you\u2026\u201dAt this point, it was creepy. Seeing the disapproval on my face, the servant\u2019s expression crumbled and he stuttered a little.\u201cGee, I\u2019m in trouble right now, shall I refuse?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to refuse.\u201dEven if the servant told him to leave, Jason would not be convinced and would continue to shove his way into this mansion.I didn\u2019t even give you room to do so, so I don\u2019t know why you keep messing around.It\u2019s not the gum stuck on the sole of some shoe\u2026\u2026. At this point, I headed to the drawing room with the intention of putting a nail on it altogether.As I entered the drawing room, Jason, who was sitting on the sofa, looked at me, smiled and waved his hand.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m offended if you keep coming here even though you don\u2019t have any business, Sir Kazar. Please leave.\u201d\u201cI heard that Alecto is taking Helena to this debutante ball, I\u2019m thinking of us partnering up as the people who lost their partner.\u201d\u201cSorry, Sir Kazar, I\u2019m going to take my knight as my partner.\u201dJason raised his eyebrows in surprise, then glanced at Anakin. He replied in a soft voice.\u201cHe must not be in the same class as you. Wasn\u2019t that why you chose me at the coming-of-age ceremony?\u201dIt was true. At that time, I didn\u2019t want to be looked down upon, so I ran my calculations here and there to get the best number of moves. As if he knew everything, Jason added.\u201cIf you walk in with that knight, won\u2019t everyone at the debutante ball laugh at you for being abandoned? Can you handle those glances? Oh, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201dThis was also true. No matter how beautiful and glamorous I appear, everyone in the social world will focus more on who the man next to me is. Then they will try to judge me by my man\u2019s \u2018class\u2019. I was fed up with Jason, who came to me triumphantly after calculating all that.\u201cBut I\u2019m not going with you.\u201dI told him one more time in case he didn\u2019t understand\u201cI\u2019m not going with you.\u201dJane\u2019s life was no different from any other woman\u2019s. She was born as a poor aristocrat, then she married another aristocrat who was similarly poor, then she led a simple but undisturbed household.Her husband, who served as a court attendant, would always buy her a flower when he returned home despite his tight income.Then she put the flower in a bottle, and when it withered a little, she\u2019d make it into jam.It was a sudden money plague that staggered her happy life. Her ill husband was forced to stop working and when the earnings disappeared, she had to send out even her maid, who was the only other person in her house.Even if she tried to get her parents or in-laws to lend a hand, it did not help as both of them were from poor families.Her chores and her husband\u2019s care are now hers. The sewing that she had done with her handmaiden became her way of making wages for a living, as she had to work all day long to earn her husband\u2019s medicine.She would be lying if she said she didn\u2019t blame her husband. She couldn\u2019t even answer the question whether she still loved her husband, asked to her by her neighbour who saw her suffering. Because she didn\u2019t love him in the first place.But Jane didn\u2019t want her husband to die. Like things that could not be thrown away easily even if they were broken and buried for a long time, she was attached to her husband and couldn\u2019t even run away,\u2013 Sorry.Her husband used to say sorry more often than thanks. Although it is rather Jane, who is sorry for him, not being able to repay him for his love for her.Contrary to her wishes, her husband died early from illness. He said he was sorry until the end. She wished he could have said something else if it was really the last time. Jane became this type of widow.The calluses on her hands grew.Her wages and sewing skills increased alongside her calluses, and places calling for Jane began to appear one by one, it was enough to make a living.It was when she happened to get a job for a Marquis, When she was about to return home after finishing her work, a servant caught Jane.Did she do something wrong? But she couldn\u2019t remember no matter how much she thought, so she entered the room, terrified.In the room, the Marquis\u2019 only daughter, Eris Mis\u00e9rian, sat elegantly sipping her tea. When she saw Jane, she threw a pair of clothes that were set aside at her feet and asked.\u2013 Did you make these clothes?\u2013 Yes, miss.The maid who entrusted her with work complained that she did not have a proper outfit for going out, so it was made by tweaking the old clothes she had.Lady Mis\u00e9rian looked at her for a moment and then threw another pair of her clothes.It was a beautiful turquoise dress.\u2013 Make it similar to this dress, but much prettier. Can you do it?\u2013 I\u2019ll do it.\u2013 I heard you\u2019re a widow? Stay here until the dress is finished. The fact that you are making these dresses should never spread\u2026\u2026. Do you understand what mean?\u2013 I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u2013 Okay, let\u2019s go. If you need anything, ask my maid. Don\u2019t let me down.Jane picked up the dress and went into the room the maid had led her into. She had heard rumours that Marquis Mis\u00e9rian was the richest man in the capital, but was surprised to find out that this wasn\u2019t his original mansion, and that the small room in this townhouse was about the size of the house she had lived in.Jane sat alone on the bed in the room, organizing her thoughts. This level of authority was a secret. Killing a couple of people wouldn\u2019t be a problem, so if she\u2019s unlucky, she might not be able to survive here. She had to do her best.Jane was awake for almost three days and nights. Because the time given to her was shorter than she thought. The clothes were mended to fit her size and additional lace and decorations were made and sewnIt was a semi-forced job, but as time went by tiredness disappeared and the joy increased.Was making clothes always this enjoyable? No, could it have been more enjoyable than that? The euphoria she felt when she finally put the finished clothes on her master and looked at it\u2026\u2026! It couldn\u2019t be compared to anything else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jane, who saw her \u2018work\u2019 being completed, asked quietly.\u2013 Why did you ask me to make this dress?\u2013 One of the girls I hung out with didn\u2019t dare invite me to the party. I know she wants to stand out the most at the party, but she shouldn\u2019t have thought about it like that and put it into practice.Lady Mis\u00e9rian finished her makeup and looked back at Jane, smiling innocently.\u2013 That\u2019s why I stole the clothes for her debutante ball and told you to mend them. Soon her partner will show up at the mansion to pick me up. What would her expression be like if she lost all the attention she wanted to receive on the most important day of her life? Aren\u2019t you curious?Just for that reason? The debutante ball was one of the most important days of Jane\u2019s life. It was every girl\u2019s dream, and it was also a place to make friends as well as meet someone to marry in the future.With the thought that Lady Mis\u00e9rian was as vicious as the rumors said, a person suddenly came to mind.\u2013 But isn\u2019t Lady Mis\u00e9rian engaged to the Crown Prince? Even if you take another man as your partner\u2026 Is it okay?Oops, I stepped on a landmine. Lady Mis\u00e9rian erased her laughter and glared at Jane fiercely. Then she turned her gaze to the mirror and murmured,\u2013 After all, he doesn\u2019t go to such a party. Even if he attends, he probably won\u2019t be interested in meThere was loneliness in her whispered voice as she polished her beautiful appearance in the mirror. As Jane took a step forward to say something, Lady Mis\u00e9rian just turned her head and smiled.\u2013 So, if it reaches His Highness\u2019 ears that I have entered with another man, and he became jealous of him, wouldn\u2019t that be a benefit too?No one can ignore me, said Lady Mis\u00e9rian.That day, Jane was allowed to follow Lady Mis\u00e9rian to Lady Morgan\u2019s debutante ball and watch from a distance.For the guilt of ignoring her, Lady Morgan was forced to enter the hall alone without her partner, and everyone at her debutante ball murmured, comparing Lady Morgan to Lady Mis\u00e9rian.Lady Morgan finally burst into tears, but no one was willing to stand in front of her because they were all looking at Lady Mis\u00e9rian. It was literally a jungle, it was the harsh law of nature.\u2013 I liked your talent. Will you continue to make my clothes like today?After the banquet, Lady Mis\u00e9rian made a proposal to Jane on the return carriage. As Jane hesitated at the sudden invitation, she added another sentence,\u2013 Instead, you must throw away all of your life so far. Living as a completely different person.\u2013 Yes? What do you mean\u2026.\u2013 What\u2019s so surprising? Did you think this Eris Mis\u00e9rian could wear the clothes made by a poor villager?\u2013 \u2026\u2026Are you ashamed?As Jane responded in a small tone, Lady Mis\u00e9rian leaned over and whispered to her, as if to appease her. (TL/N: if Eris did that to me, I would f*cking feel gay.)\u2013 No matter how beautiful the clothes you make are, if the maker\u2019s status is low, it will be a lowly garment. Even if it\u2019s sad, I can\u2019t help it because this is what class is all about.Since ancient times, there has been a great wall between nobles and commoners. And now that the times have advanced, another wall of \u2018wealth\u2019 has been created.Poor aristocrats were sometimes inferior to commoners.She had to keep her dignity, but she didn\u2019t have the money for that. In order to earn money, such ones had to give up their dignity, so even if they were poor, there were aristocrats who died like a nobleman\u2019, Jane was a poor aristocrat.\u2013 I will be your patron. I will give you a new identity and I will spare no effort to support you so that you can succeed. Because I feel good today.Lady Mis\u00e9rian smirked, as if doing a great favor. A look of embarrassment swept over Jane.She thought she wouldn\u2019t have suffered so much if she had been born into a good family. If she was lucky and was born as the daughter of a powerful family, would it have been okay to look down on people like this? She was upset. She was upset, but\u2026.\u2013 I will.Jane was fed up with poverty. She wanted to end her days of barely satisfying her hunger with porridge boiled with only potatoes and flour because she had nothing else to eat.She didn\u2019t like the situation of losing all the money she had saved up in an instant if she caught a cold even if she worked hard.She had nothing more to lose.If she missed this opportunity now because of her pride, she may be unable to sleep because of hunger pangs in her stomach. Lady Mis\u00e9rian smiled, satisfied with the change in Jane\u2019s eyes.\u2013 Great. You will be my distant relative from now on. You will say you lived in the Kendall region and came up here a while ago. What would be a good name\u2026..Lady Miserian stroked Jane\u2019s brown hair and shook her hands as if to shake off the dirt.\u2013 Twal Rose. Let\u2019s go with Twal Rose. Madame Twal Rose. Dye your hair pink to match the name. The more unconventional the first impression is the better.Having destroyed everything related to Jane, she had lived as Twal Rose from that day forward. Name, appearance, behavior, tone of voice, taste, past\u2026\u2026She changed everything she could.When she was finally ready, she carved the name Jane\u2019 on a tombstone next to her husband\u2019s tombstone. She no longer looked back when she heard the name Jane.Twal Rose\u2019s salon quickly took over the social world. She made a small selection of beautiful dresses that fit the ladies perfectly, one couldn\u2019t even dream of getting her dresses unless they bought it faster than everyone else.In addition, when the picky Lady Mis\u00e9rian was rumored to sponsor and care about her, the ladies worked hard to get Twal Rose\u2019s dresses to impress Lady Mis\u00e9rian.The noble\u2019s servants walked in and out of Twal Rose\u2019s salon door and handed out invitations to her. If she ever showed up at an invited place, they would flirt with her and fret to get a dress. Among them, there was a household where she had once been their paid seamstress.It was funny. She had changed everything from her appearance, habits and manner of speech, but the only thing that remained the same as before were her sewing skills.But no one recognized any traces of Jane. So even though Twal Rose had all the wealth and fame in her hands, she sometimes felt empty.She looked in the mirror and saw a strange woman standing there. There was nothing left to prove her past self, that is, her true self.All for \u2018Twal Rose\u2019, not \u2018Jane\u2019. A life full of lies was choking her neck.Even though she would never get caught, she sometimes dreamed of falling down after being discovered that she was Jane.She sometimes dreamed of her husband. Each time her husband\u2019s face faded, she felt sorry for him, but she had no way of remembering him. Even if she digs his grave right now, only a skeleton would be waiting for her.The emptiness stung her. But she had no one else to consult with. There was only one person left in this current world who knew she was \u2018Jane\u2019.And that one, Lady Mis\u00e9rian, laughed at Twal Rose\u2019s concerns as soon as she heard them.\u2013 You\u2019ve been thinking a lot. Do you think there is anyone in this world who only tells the truth? Do you believe that there is a person who is completely clean?Lady Mis\u00e9rian exclaimed fiercely.\u2013 Good or evil, everyone lies! They only try to show what they want to show\u2026..! Don\u2019t most people call that \u2018courtesy\u2019?\u2013 But Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026\u2013 Stop.Lady Mis\u00e9rian stood up and looked down at Twal Rose coldly. At that overbearing gaze, Twal Rose\u2019s body shuddered.In an instant, she returned to Jane. Then with a spark in her eyes, Lady Mis\u00e9rian whispered to Jane.\u2013 How much of the \u2018real me\u2019 do you think you know? How much do you think you know me? Will there ever come a day in your life when you will know the \u2018real me\u2019?At the eerie remark, Twal Rose\u2019s heart sank. She thought she had Lady Mis\u00e9rian figured out. If you knew Lady Mis\u00e9rian, you would have guessed that she wasn\u2019t that much different from the other young girls.She had just realized that she had misjudged. Lady Mis\u00e9rian changed her expression and smiled. She looked creepy.\u2013 I\u2019m kidding. Why do you think the faked figure isn\u2019t the real you? Who decides that? If you truly believe that you are who you are, then that is also you.She turned her back to Twal Rose and looked out the window. A storm was coming, but she didn\u2019t mind and opened the window. Lady_Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s hair fluttered in the wind. She was really beautiful.\u2013 Don\u2019t let others judge you. You judge yourself.As she watched her black storm-like hair fluttering in the wind, all her worries seemed insignificant. Beautiful things sometimes make you forget all your thoughts. That\u2019s why mankind has longed for beauty for so long.Lady Mis\u00e9rian asked quietly, looking at Twal Rose.-\u2026\u2026 Who are you?\u2026\u2026..Madame Twal Rose.I am your Twal Rose.He honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say no. He was staring at me with his mouth wide open. He also seemed confused. He chose his words for a while and managed to open his mouth.\u201cThis is not the time to build self-esteem, young lady.\u201d\u201cIf I was going to build self-esteem, I would have accepted your offer.\u201d\u201cThen why the hell!\u201d\u201cI hate you.\u201dJason raised his voice, but I cut him off. As I pulled out the stone stuck in my fingernail, I added, speaking softly.\u201cNo matter what people say, going out with you as a partner is even more annoying.\u201d\u201cWhy do you hate me so much? I apologized\u2026\u201d\u201cDid I accept that apology? Not from my memory.\u201dI\u2019m not obligated to forgive you just because you are apologizing. An apple is just an apple after all. Even if I forgave him, what would that mean? He\u2019d constantly be rambling on and repeating his empty apologies.How easy has it been that he lived a life that is so comfortable that he doesn\u2019t even think about other people\u2019s feelings and only insists on his own opinion and stubbornness?Now, I even marveled at Jason.Envy him.Because he is a person who is tolerable no matter how many times he makes a mistake. He seems to have lived with people who understood him even when he said that, but not me.\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t want to see me for the rest of your life? It\u2019s because I\u2026 was hostile to you in the first place? Only for that reason?\u201d\u201cHow can it be considered \u2018only\u2019? Isn\u2019t it as if the trust has really been broken? How can I believe that someone who once hated me won\u2019t betray meagain?\u201d\u201cIf I prove it, will you believe me then?\u201dMeaning of \u201clane\u201d: The name Jane is of English origin and means God is gracious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Like with a true customer, you have to agree eagerly and soothe them with pretty words to end it early. The unfortunate thing was that I couldn\u2019t do that at all.If I said that I disliked it, I would be too obvious, but if I didn\u2019t, it would be like having a knife at my throat. It might have been a little easier if I could please Jason. He might lose interest sooner and not bother me,\u201cHow are you going to prove it?\u201d\u201cBy doing anything you ask.\u201dBut I didn\u2019t want to. These days, I was out of breath even when trying to calm myself down. I pressed the middle of my forehead when my head began to ache again.\u201cI don\u2019t know why Lord Kazar is so persistent withme.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one who wants to know why Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026 refuses favors. When you are having a hard time\u2026 is it that hard to say that you are having a hard time?\u201dRather, I would have understood if he liked me. But Jason doesn\u2019t like me. If he liked me, he wouldn\u2019t havesaid such nonsense. Just by looking at the difference in attitude he had toward Helena and me right now, it was not love.It\u2019s not love, it\u2019s not sympathy, at the very least it\u2019s not even the clich\u00e9 of \u2018You\u2019re the first woman who pushed me away\u2019 like the male protagonist in a drama.Then why the hell?\u201cTo be honest\u2026 Lady Mis\u00e9rian was only weak against His Highness. You always acted like that. Acting like you don\u2019t need anyone other than His Highness, pretending to be strong and putting up thorns.\u201dHe strode over to me with bloodshot eyes and grabbed both of my wrists. I twisted my body to get away, but his grip was so strong that I couldn\u2019t move,Jason restrained others as he pleased, but he was acting as if he had been the one imprisoned when he squeezed his sad eyes as he spoke.\u201cThat\u2019s how you increase your number of enemies.. You say you\u2019ve grown up. Didn\u2019t you say that you realized that His Highness wouldn\u2019t love you? You said, you wanted to take a break\u2026. Why\u2026\u2026 are you whipping yourself?\u201d (PR/N: \u2018Whipping in this case meant \u2018punishing \ud83d\ude42Eris\u2019s image was clearly reflected in his eyes, but somehow it was out of focus. As if looking at someone else. Oh, now I understand. He was projecting himself onto me.\u2013 I trained to slay a dragon until I bled. I held a sword as soon as I could walk and didn\u2019t rest even for a day.\u2013 I wanted to live, I wanted to run away and I thought it was all unreasonable.The young Jason who could not do anything despite being forced to do something unreasonable, and Jason Kazar who had to die to meet someone\u2019s expectations! He is trying to save me and comfort his former self.I was so angry that my ears became hot. It felt like my head was spinning from the lack of oxygen.Why are you trying to use other people to treat your own trauma? How ridiculous do you think people are\u2026\u2026!When a person is angry, superpower springs up.I shook off Jason\u2019s hand and slapped his cheek.\u201cWhat the hell do you know about me\u2026! Don\u2019t treat me like a weak woman you have to protect! You really don\u2019t have a clue? I\u2019m not miserable at all! It\u2019s you who wants me to be miserable! That\u2019s how I can dig myself into a hole!\u201dThe words I have been holding back from Jason so far, I vented out all the anger that was boiling up in my abdomen. I couldn\u2019t breathe well. He looked shocked, but I couldn\u2019t stop my already opened mouth.\u201cDo I hate you? What if I hate you, and what if I don\u2019t? Are you so afraid of being hated? Did you think you would only be loved by everyone in the world?\u201dIt was an idea that even a young child would not have. After all, you are trying to entrust your ego to someone you don\u2019t know. My stomach twisted, snorted and asked Jason with a cold face.\u201cWhat do I think of you\u2026 do you really want to hear that?\u201dJason tried to blankly nod his head, but suddenly, out of fear, he hurriedly shook it. But however Jason answered, I was going to be honest. I\u2019d laugh, casually, but tell a story he would never want to hear,\u201cYou know\u2026 I\u2019m not interested in Lord Kazar. I don\u2019t hate you either. Hating is only possible if one\u2019s interested.\u201dOne step forward. I approached Jason. Then Jason took a step back from me as if he was afraid of something. Without stopping, I took another step\u2026..Jason\u2019s eyes became moist. When Jason finally bumped into the wall and looked down at me in horror, I quietly said to him,\u201cI\u2019m not curious at all. How you have lived and what you think.\u201dJason eventually shed tears. Even that had nothing to do with me. I didn\u2019t feel any excitement. He was at a loss and eventually tried to reach out to me.I shrugged off the hand in anger.It was annoying.\u201cWhat makes you happy and sad\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t want to know, and I want to forget even if I know. I won\u2019t cry even if you go somewhere and die tomorrow. Because you\u2019re \u2018a stranger\u2019 to me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.. don\u2019t need me?\u201d\u201cIf you understand, don\u2019t talk to me in the future. I\u2019m tired.\u201dI said that and turned around. For how long did I walk down the hallway to get back to my room?\u201cWait, wait, please, young lady!\u201dI heard Jason chasing me from behind. As I ignored him and walked on firmly, the sound of his footsteps approached me. I thought he was going to grab my wrist soon.Tack. A friction sound. But somehow I didn\u2019t feel anything on my wrist.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnakin was holding Jason\u2019s wrist. Anakin released his hand when Jason used his strength. Because of that, Jason, who was shaken by the retaliation, stared furiously at Anakin.\u201cHow dare you touch the body of a noble\u2026 Do you want to die?\u201d\u201cMy master is not Sir Kazar, and\u2026 whoever touches my master, if she doesn\u2019t want it, it is my duty to stop him.\u201dAnakin responded coldly to Jason\u2019s threat, knelt down on one of his knees and looked up at me.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dHe looked like a loyal dog waiting for an order, and so I sighed and laughed. After all, I said that I wouldn\u2019t see him as a human dog. As I was about to stroke Anakin\u2019s head, my hand stopped and I looked at Jason.Flinch. Jason studied my face. I poured everything out earlier and now I was no longer angry.\u201cJason Kazar, don\u2019t bother me and leave.\u201d\u201cIf you want to throw away your feelings or memories like trash, I\u2019ll lend you a mirror. Take care of it by yourself. Don\u2019t look for other people.\u201dI\u2019m talking about Helena. I added clearly to him by mouthing it silently.Helena. The stupid kid was sure to accept Jason\u2019s visit.I won\u2019t be able to see that again.Jason stood devastated.When the maid, who was cleaning the room, saw us standing, she covered her mouth in shock. She saw my expression and quickly approached Jason. I told her.\u201cEmma, it seems that the guest is lost. See him off to the exit.\u201d\u201cYes, miss. Lord Kazar, please come this way.\u201dAfter finally sending Jason away, I was exhausted both physically and mentally. I almost dragged myself and managed to open my door. I waved my hand to stop Anakin, who was trying to follow me in.\u201cAnakin, you go to the kitchen and get some medicine. My head hurts.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs Anakin left, I locked the door and buried my head in the pillow. I also got really upset. Locking the door so he can\u2019t come in while he brings the medicine I told him to. (TL/N: haha she is being grumpy here)I just wanted to get confirmation. I don\u2019t want Anakin to give up on me easily, no matter how grumpy I was. For me, I wish he would try.The pillow got wet. I wasn\u2019t even sad, but tears came out. Everything was annoying. My insides were aching because of the stomach cramps caused by stress. I couldn\u2019t even groan and just chewed my mouth. Praying that the pain will pass quickly. My face was wet with cold sweat and tears.Creak. I could hear the doorknob turning, but the door wouldn\u2019t open because I locked it.I felt really sick and I wanted to pass out rather than die. Then, suddenly, there was the sound of the door opening.From a blurry vision, I saw that Anakin opened the door and entered. He quietly placed the brought items on the bedside table and waved lightly in front of my eyes.\u201cMaster, are you awake? I brought you some medicine.\u201d\u201c\u2026How did you open the door?\u201d\u201cI was worried\u2026 so I asked the servant for the key, Can you get up?\u201dI actually thought he would come in using a revolutionary way. Breaking the door or coming through the window\u2026.. A little more like a scene from a novel.My way of thinking is also changing as it is a fictional world. Anakin held me firmly as I fumbled to get up. I felt dizzy.I rested my back on Anakin\u2019s chest, breathing, and Anakin brought the vial to my mouth.\u201cKeep drinking it.\u201dHe said in a low voice. I drank all the medicine he gave me, and even drank the water he gave me to cool my mouth.Whether it was a placebo effect or not as the medicine might not have activated yet, but the pain reduced.Even after I finished taking the medicine, he didn\u2019t leave and he wiped my face with a cold towel. I liked the touch, so I felt pathetic, yet I wanted to ask.\u201cDo you like me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I didn\u2019t even ask if you love meAnakin\u2019s mouth slowly opened. The moment he tried to answer something. I suddenly came to my senses. What did I just say? What if he likes me? I was going to leave anyway. Nothing could be returned to Anakin. I shouted urgently.\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d\u201c\u2026But.\u201d\u201cI told you not to!\u201dI quickly closed Anakin\u2019s mouth by covering it with my palm. Until just now, I had reprimanded Jason not to be trash and use other people\u2019s emotions, but now I almost used Anakin like that.I\u2019m his master. He can\u2019t refuse me, so I shouldn\u2019t have gone this far.Funny. People are so deceitful. Other people\u2019s flaws looked bigger than anyone else\u2019s, so we struggled to fix them. Even if they could be our fault, we would search for excuses first.I\u2019m disillusioned with myself.When I stopped him, he pulled the palm that covered his mouth to his cheek and just looked at me silently. That was a good look.I liked that he waited for me. Amid all the commotion pouring towards me, he alone was quiet, so that was good.I wanted to show only a cool and strong image to you who liked that. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden even if could get help from you.I\u2019d rather die than look weak to you.I thought, stroking his cheek. If Anakin likes me\u2026\u2026. Was that really \u2018me\u2019? Could it not be that the causality of this novel made him fall in love with \u2018Eris\u201d? With suspicion, fear grew.What if I don\u2019t want to go back?I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll love you too much.\u2018If you make me \u2018Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2019, if I stay here because of you and lose you, I will have to live the rest of my life without dying.No, come to think of it, it wasn\u2019t a life that I was really afraid of. Even if I loved you and stayed here, I could never be happy. In the end, it will be filled with regrets and I will resent myself and you who made me remain. I am afraid that I might become the type of person I despise the most.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can go out. About\u2026 thank you.\u201dI got out of his arms and laid quietly on the bed. He wrapped the blanket up to the end of my neck and turned his head away. Anakin didn\u2019t leave for amoment, then looked at me. But in the end, I heard the sound of walking away.Don\u2019t go. As the door closed, I suddenly became caught in that thought and hurriedly turned my head,And I made eye contact with Anakin who was still looking at me. My face was burning up. What if I was being impatient? Several excuses passed through my mind. But Anakin only asked me quietly.\u201cAre you in so much pain that you can\u2019t sleep\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCan I stay by your side?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes.\u201dAnakin quietly knelt next to me. I looked at Anakin like that and closed my eyes. Then he carefully grabbed my fingertips on the blanket. To confirm his existence even if I couldn\u2019t see him in front of me.Finally, let\u2019s make one more excuse today. I\u2019m sick. All humans will get sick so that doesn\u2019t mean I look weak.Tomorrow is the debutante ball, and I am now entering the palace as if I am revising everything at the last minute.Helena was a sincere student, so she had thoroughly reviewed even without me. At this rate, if she studied a little more after the debutante ball, she could become a crown princess without difficulty.In the first place, there was not much to teach except for court manners.Political sensibility and state administration were tasks that required some sense, and it was not something I could teach.Still, I gave Helena a brief word of praise for her obedience to my instructions.Now, for tomorrow\u2019s sake, I was going to go there, but suddenly, there was a commotion outside.Before his attendant could even say his name, the crown prince suddenly opened the door and enteredAs soon as he saw us both, he scrunched up his face, grabbed Helena\u2019s wrist and hid her behind him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Your Highness. It\u2019s a dazzling afternoon. Is there any reason for you to come in a hurry, even breaking the etiquette?\u201d\u201cWhy are you with Helena?\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter if I tell you the truth because the training is already over, but somehow I was reluctant. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m nervous because I\u2019m not.Come to think of it, breaking up with me and Helena becoming the crown princess are all good things for the crown prince, so I didn\u2019t want to nicely tell him that. Helena, who was alternating her gaze between the two of us, slipped in between.\u201c1, 1, I caught Lady Miserian for a cup of tea, right, Lady Miserian?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 have no fear! What would you do if that harmed you?\u201dThe crown prince, who referred to a person using a direct pronoun and not a personal pronoun, carefully checked to see if Helena was injured. As I watched, asked in annoyance.\u201cAm I a monster?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re more poisonous than a monster. If I had been with a monster, I wouldn\u2019t have been so concerned.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen Helena stopped him, he stopped staring at me and looked down at Helena. Those were the eyes that saw the most adorable thing in the world. The prince whispered as he carefully tucked her hair behind her ear, as if he was afraid of breaking Helena.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cYes? What do you have to say\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWould you like to come to Young Lady Kazar\u2019s debutante ball with me? As my partner. Don\u2019t you know the lady too?\u201dHelena looked at me for a moment. I nodded my head slightly as a sign of permission.I was going to talk to the crown prince first about this today anyway. This way was more plausible than the crown prince being rejected by his fianc\u00e9e who had been pinning after his love.\u201cDid you plan to come too?\u201d\u201cOf course I have to go, Your Majesty. It\u2019s the Young Lady\u2019s debutante ball, how can I miss it?\u201d\u201cAlone, without a partner?\u201dThe nobleman, who should have been my partner, was laughing at me after he requested for someone else to be his partner right in front of me. I knew from our first meeting that the crown prince was shameless, but I just smiled and accepted it. In the first place, it\u2019s more annoying if you treat these things casually.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a partner? Isn\u2019t there Anakin?\u201d\u201cAnakin?\u201d\u201cYou probably saw him last time. My escort knight, Your Highness.\u201dThe prince\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cIsn\u2019t he\u2026 a commoner?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, with all due respect\u2026\u2026 Lady Antebellum is still a commoner.\u201dYou\u2019re taking a commoner partner too, is this something I can\u2019t do? If both of us take a commoner partner, it will be worth seeing people\u2019s faces. I didn\u2019t bother to say that. He asked with a cold face.\u201cDoes your father know this?\u201d\u201cIf my father doesn\u2019t know, are you going to be my partner then? You\u2019re not going to do that\u2026..\u201d\u201cAre you going to pretend to lose the imperial family?\u201dEven though I was struggling, the crown prince hit the nail on the head with a serious face. So I answered seriously with a thin expression.\u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019d like to break ties with the imperial family this time.\u201d\u201cThe Marquis\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy father may be able to re-establish the connection, but it will never be through me.\u201dWhy is your face so shocked? You didn\u2019t think that \u201cYour Eris\u2019 would ever say something like this for the rest of her life? No matter what you said, did you think she wouldn\u2019t let you go?Yes, Eris Mis\u00e9rian wouldn\u2019t have. Even if it was closer to regret than love, she would have never let go of the prince\u2019s hand.But standing here, I only put on Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s outer shell and I am a completely different person from her. Now I\u2019m going to do what she said she had to, but never did.\u201cI will have to go through a number of formalities.. but I will tell you personally first. We will break up our marriage in the near future, Your Highness. If we break up, we will become strangers so we won\u2019t have to face each other anymore.\u201d\u201cThe affairs of the imperial family are not at your disposal. Didn\u2019t you say at first that it was the marriage between the imperial family and the marquis?\u201dThe crown prince must really know nothing.All of this broken engagement, broken marriage, just knew how to sing in line, but what did I do with my own hands\u2026\u2026 (PR/N: she\u2019s likely referring to herself as a puppet.)\u201cIt was approved by Her Majesty the Empress. Is that an answer?\u201d\u201cOh, my mother?\u201dI bowed my knees slightly to greet the prince and just before leaving the room, I opened my eyes wide and as if wondering, I added to the crown prince who was still looking at me.\u201cYour Highness, didn\u2019t you want it as much?\u201d\u201dFinally, the day of the showdown has come. Somehow since it was the day of the showdown, I looked determined.In fact, it\u2019s an adult ceremony at someone else\u2019s house. Still, it was like an implicit declaration of the breakup so I had to work hard to decorate.The dress that Madame sent me was so pretty that there was a possibility that my face would be pushed back.After this pretty dress arrived, I decided to match all the jewellery to the dress.I also matched my makeup using a soft coral tonel didn\u2019t normally wear and untied my hair which I had always kept neat in a half ponytail. Instead of a gorgeous jewel necklace, a ribbon was tied with black silk, and the earrings were instead crafted with large emeralds.The fluffy and soft dress looked just like cotton candy. I wore lace gloves of the same colour as my dress and had a crafted pink diamond flower on my hair.Hmm, I don\u2019t look like a villain who came to harm someone.However, even if I dressed up like this, I might want to f*ck with someone again when I go to the debutante ball. Because people never know how to act. And there\u2019s nothing that can be done. I have no choice but to instill a lesson to not judge people by their appearance. (QC/N: the author literally used f*ck\u201d, in this case, meaning \u2018to mess with or annoy.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 51Absolute HonorThe marquis and emperor did not come to the debutante ball. Unless the relationship was that of a father or a betrothed, it was an implicit practice for older men not to attend the debutante ball.They will probably notice later than anyone else that my partner is not the crown prince, but Anakin. purposely aimed for that.When I opened the door and left, Anakin was waiting for me as usual. What was different was that this time, he didn\u2019t stand behind me, he held my hand and stood by my side.He was wearing a uniform with dark navy and gold, thread, and as expected, the word \u2018men\u2019s uniform was not for nothing. (PR/N: She\u2019s probably referring to men in uniforms, like police/marine/etc.)All his light brown hair was pulled back, so I touched only one side and ruffled it. Hmm, it\u2019s much better. Slicked-back hair looked too old fashioned.I smiled at Anakin, who was blinking his eyes, saying \u2018It\u2019s a trend these days.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t wrong. It just wasn\u2019t a trend in this world.Duchess Kazar\u2019s townhouse was older than that of any nobleman in the capital. However, as it was constantly undergoing renovation, it was considered to be more of an antique and stylish mansion than an oldfashioned one. Above all, the garden was much wider than the mansion.This was because due to the nature of the Kazar family who produced knights, they needed a place to train. Since it was a place for training, it was closer to an empty lot than a garden. It was also to prevent the assassins from hiding as much as possible in case of any event.Instead, the Duke of Kazar\u2019s mansion was exceptionally small for a nobleman\u2019s mansion. When holding a banquet, because of its size, it was impossible to bring in all the guests. So when I read, the novel, there was a description that the banquets of Duke Kazar were always held in the gardenLast time, there weren\u2019t many people at the tea party, I couldn\u2019t imagine having a meeting on the terrace of a small mansion, it was a little embarrassing to call it a flower garden.A banquet in a place like a lawn playground? However, when I arrived, I thought they were definitely one of the greatest nobles in the country.The garden, which was brightly lit with 1,000 lights, was decorated with 10,000 flowers. Not only was it full of antique tables and chairs, but there was also a road paved with blue satin towards the fountain, which I don\u2019t know where it came from. There were, even people dressed splendidly there, so it was a landscape closer to a famous painting than reality.Originally, important people appeared later during banquets. When we got off the carriage, the servant tried to announce our status loudly. However, the young servant looked at Anakin with a slightly embarrassed face and bowed his head again and again and asked.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s partner is not written on the list. Excuse me, but I\u2019d like to ask how to introduce you.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s my knight.\u201d\u201cOh, then like Sir Kazar\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? It\u2019s \u2018my knight\u2019, not the country\u2019s.\u201dWhen I shook my head and showed signs of discomfort to the servant who asked if he had been given a title, Anakin quietly spoke to him.\u201cJust Lady Mis\u00e9rian and her knight is enough.\u201d\u201cYes, yes! Excuse me! Lady Mis\u00e9rian and the lady\u2019s knight are entering!\u201dAs the servant shouted loudly, the eyes of the people who were talking to each other turned to this side, They looked surprised for a moment and quickly removed it from their faces. Indeed, without a single error in my estimations, they were busy gossiping about the fact that Anakin was next to me.Either way, I slowly made my way to the center of the garden. With every step I took, the ample skirt\u2019s hem fluttered.In the pouring attention, I found Lady Kazar, today\u2019s main character.Lady Kazar curled her red hair, which was like her brother\u2019s, and the combination of the light sky blue dress and white lace was very beautiful. When she found me, she greeted me in a rather modest way with her pearls accessories dangling.\u201cThank you for coming, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more than grateful to you for inviting me here, Lady Kazar. Please take care of me in the future.\u201dWhile we were exchanging formal greetings, the voice of the servant rang out once again.\u201cPrince Alecto is entering with Lady Antebellum\u2026..!\u201dHmm. The introduction is a little shorter. Is it because it\u2019s not the royal palace? As soon as the names of the two were shouted, there was a slight disturbance.People looked at my expression blatantly without showing signs of concealing. I was actually thinking something out of line. Just look at me. Did I make any expression other than a sour one?Numbly looking at the entrance, the two most beautiful people in the world appeared.Helena was exactly how I decorated her. Purple, which was the color of the imperial family, was wrapped around her body and her long hair, which was neatly braided to one side, shined like the Milky Way during the evening. After contemplating on the tiara until the end, I eventually decided to put a violet ornament made of amethyst between the braids, and it was a wise choice.The crown prince also looked more like the sun god Apollo than a human being. Seeing that Helena\u2019s beauty, which I have polished, is not a joke and does not fade, I also wondered if the crown prince had put a lot of effort into decorating today.The crown prince and Helena looked at us and walked slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s my absolute honor that you\u2019re here, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s natural because you\u2019re the younger sister of Jason. Since the debutante ball was held, you will soon become an adult.\u201d\u201cGirls always grow up fast\u2026. What about the lady over here?\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Lady Kazar. I\u2019ve heard a lot from Lord Kazar. It\u2019s our first time seeing each other like this, right?\u201dCome to think of it, Helena was always in the Imperial Palace, and Jason was in a position to visit the Imperial Palace to see Helena and the crown prince, so even a childhood friend must not have been close to the siblings. Somehow, I wondered why Kazar\u2019s young lady looked so subtle.\u201cI also heard a lot from my brother. I didn\u2019t expect to see you\u2026\u201d\u201cT\u2019ll see you often in the future, right, Lady Antebellum?\u201dI looked at Helena silently. Now Helena had to do what Eris had been doing. Attend parties held by people who are not even close to each other, smile and respond to people even if she doesn\u2019t want to see them, and remember only the necessary information to use skilfully later.Helena looked at me for a while, blinked and nodded slowly.Lady Kazar was confused by my remark and looked back at the two of us alternately.You probably can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t imagine that Lady Miserian will break up with the crown prince.Then I heard people gossiping in my ears.\u201cWhat is this\u2026. Among the swans, there are no ducks, but crows.\u201d\u201cBy the way. I heard it earlier, so he didn\u2019t get a title, it was said that he was a personal escort knight?\u201cDon\u2019t be too harsh, ladies. Couldn\u2019t that guy flirt with Lady Mis\u00e9rian, who had been abandoned by His Highness?\u201d\u201cOh my god, the Count is so\u2026.! Lady Mis\u00e9rian has just become an adult so it\u2019s natural that she doesn\u2019t know the world yet.\u201dOh my, I only looked at what I saw with my eyes.I think you guys are having an affair. When I looked back, men and women quickly avoided my eyes and coughed in vain.Certainly, all the faces shone at this meeting. With all the most handsome and beautiful women in the world, gathered, Anakin\u2019s existence, which was only a supporting role, deserved to be completely erased.What\u2019s the point if only the outside is flashy? There is no essence inside. I snorted inwardly. Anakin was even more unfortunate if you swapped him with the crown prince.When I looked at Anakin, Anakin followed me and faced me. He tilted his head slightly to the side as if asking if I had something to say.Even if you\u2019re handsome for a season, if someone looks cute, it\u2019s over. I smiled and tried to push Anakin\u2019s fluffy hair back, but an ugly face appeared. It would be rather strange not to show up on his only sister\u2019s birthday.Dressed up more than ever, Jason was calmly walking this way with a bouquet of flowers in one hand, his ponytail tied with a ribbon that seemed a little longerBecause Jason was so big, there was an optical illusion that the garden looked like a runway. He smelled the scent of the flowers once and handed the bouquet of flowers to his sister.\u201cCongratulations on your debut, Paena. Long time no see, Your Highness. Helena, you too.\u201d\u201cEven if I told you not to come, you came and went to the imperial palace, but these days, it\u2019s been a while\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of people who want to see me come back alive. I was a bit busy. Right, Paena?\u201d\u201cMy brother was a little busy running away.\u201dIn the midst of a friendly conversation, Jason stared at me. I didn\u2019t stop looking even though I didn\u2019t glance on purpose. The crown prince asked without noticing,\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you bring anyone as a partner? It\u2019s not like you.\u201d\u201cI applied, but I was rejected.\u201dEven while saying that, he was staring at me. If you\u2019re going to do this, why don\u2019t you spread the word that you\u2019ve been rejected by me?Even the crown prince noticed something and began to take turns looking at Jason. I was going to look back at Jason and say a word, but Helena smiled and said,\u201cWhoa, she is such a bold lady to refuse Jason.\u201dAt this time, Helena\u2019s lack of sense felt cute and lovely. When Jason, who couldn\u2019t let go of his lingering feelings, was about to add more words, the band began to play dance songs, perhaps judging that all the main characters had appeared.Although it was a little uncomfortable to dance on the lawn, I thought it was romantic, they were all memorable faces.(QC/N: I believed our FL thought it was memorable as most of the main characters were gathered in such a nice place.)I reached out to Anakin.\u201cWill you dance to a song?\u201dAnakin put his hand on his chest and nodded lightly\u201cIt\u2019s an honor.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Back then, had to lead him halfway, but now he\u2019s quite in sync with me.I didn\u2019t know if reading the notes helped me dance, or if I\u2019m good at roughly everything I did with my body,We continued to dance without stopping even though Polonez ended and led into Waltz. With each turn, my dress bloomed like a single flower.After dancing the Waltz, I was a little tired.After telling him to rest, I picked up a drink nearbyFrom afar, I watched Helena conversing with others as she had been educated by me.Today, Helena is another star of the party, and has as much attention as Lady Kazar.She should have actually gotten this kind of attention when she was at Eris\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony. That\u2019s because the social debut of the original Helena took place at that time.But at that time, there was no one to teach Helena. She was beautiful and kind, but her manners were messed up and she was ridiculed behind her back. It didn\u2019t stop there, and she was also bullied by Eris and her followers.Now that there is no reason for that, it\u2019s enough if you only receive love and endure the last ordeal I give you, An ordeal. Is it okay to describe it as an ordeal?The thought of the dagger in the house made my throat dry. What will happen to Helena if Hubris fails to save her?My mind was dizzy with thoughts, but Anakin covered me with a shawl. I didn\u2019t know where he brought it from. I looked at the indifferent but sweet face and asked what I was curious about.\u201cDid you practice?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnakin hesitated, and then added.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to embarrass you.\u201dWhen he said that, he lowered his eyes slightly as if he was shy. I tried to restrain myself, but the corners of my lips kept rising. I was glad that no one knew him.Anakin, it was terribly good that I was the only one in the world to know that you were lovable.I thought that for the rest of my life there would be ng relationship with monopoly, possessiveness and such feelings, but thanks to you, I was discovering a new side of myself that I did not know. (TL/N: she is obsessed with him!!! Haha obsessive female lead!!)It was a great party. Countless lanterns shone like stars, and although autumn was over, the weather was not so cold for some reason. The melodies that lingered in my ears were infinitely soft, and people\u2019s laughter continued endlessly.I knew that everyone\u2019s attention was on us. This impulsive choice could be my weakness, and maybe would regret it later.But it was a very pleasant day.As much as I want to be a little reckless. Most of all, Anakin in front of me was pretty. I lifted my head slightly and whispered to Anakin.\u201cGive me a kiss.\u201dAnakin looked surprised at those words.\u2013 Kiss me now\u2013 Yes?\u2013 Pretend to. Hurry.Oh, come to think of it, something similar happened, on the train. When I pulled his neck, he hesitated to kiss me, so I had to make sounds clumsily with my mouth.If Anakin had pulled me in and kissed me before my request, I would have understood. It\u2019s a common scene in innocent manhwa and dramas. Kissing in order to get out of a difficult situation.Moreover, Eris was so beautiful that no one would, refuse to kiss Eris.But even though Anakin supported my back, he didn\u2019t cross the line. It was good. I feel like he respects me.So I thought maybe he might refuse this time too. It would be a little embarrassing, but I think it\u2019s okay.A lot has changed since then. If I ordered Anakin to kiss me right now, he wouldn\u2019t refuse me.But I didn\u2019t want to. Because I like him. I wanted to get permission.Instead of kissing you to get out of trouble, Anakin, want you to kiss me because you want to.Our gazes collided again, as on the train. And unlike then, Anakin\u2019s pale eyes slowly closed. Without any refusal or dislike, he closed his eyes and bowed his head to me.Then he grabbed my cheeks and kissed me. Joy warmed my heart. I just wanted to scream.A rough sensation, people talking, and a feeling of exhilaration. At this moment, at this moment! The protagonist in the novel\u2026\u2026 I feel like it\u2019s just me.When the kiss was over, there was silence everywhere. People were amazed at the recklessness of \u2018Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019 and seemed terrified. Some of them were brave enough to look at the prince\u2019s expressionOf course I didn\u2019t look back. In this situation, if I looked at the prince\u2019s face, I looked like a foolish person. I didn\u2019t kiss him to get him jealous.I bowed slightly to Lady Kazar, who was alone with her partner, and then took Anakin\u2019s hand and stepped out of the room, stepping onto the blue cloth.I\u2019ve done enough to socialize, and I saw Helena doing well, so there was no reason to stay any longer. I\u2019m going to wash my feet quickly and go to bed. I was tired from preparing in the morning.In the carriage, I closed my eyes tightly for a minute, then opened them slowly. The 12th time today, this was my mood. He was good, but I was afraid of him because he was too good, and I was sad because there was a scheduled future, and then it all melted away with one small action.Maybe my head hurts often and I get motion sickness because my mind shakes like a roller coasterAnakin, on the opposite side, did not bother to ask even though he might have something to ask. He might ask me why I kissed him, but he always understood me unconditionally.So, instead, I wanted to ask.What are you thinking now?What do you think when you see me?I am curious about you\u2026\u2026 aren\u2019t you curious about me?I kissed you because I liked you. What about you?What if you feel bad?Do you like me too? If not\u2026\u2026 Just because you don\u2019t want to be in trouble?swallowed the questions that had been swirling in my mouth without spitting them out. He always waits for me, so I wanted to wait for Anakin at least once.We still have time. Let me know before my wick burns out. (TL/N: wick-a strip of porous material up which liquid fuel is drawn by capillary action to the flame in a candle, lamp, or lighter.)Only after Eris left did people exhale. As if they had been under silencing magic so far. In the midst of everyone\u2019s confusion, Paena looked back at her brother and asked him with all her might.\u201cI bet, is the rumor that that knight is Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s lover true?\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t talk.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t you bring it up first? Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s escort knight always wants to pretend to be her lover!\u201dPaena was not the only one who opened her mouth.\u201cHow could your fianc\u00e9e do that in front of Your Highness?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that she\u2019s trying to at least make him jealous. Isn\u2019t her nature like that of her father, isn\u2019t she cunning?\u201d\u201cHow meticulously she has been decorated, though not being Your Highness\u2019 partner, you would think it was Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s debutante ball.\u201dOnce the idea was formed, it came pouring out without stopping. They exclaimed excitedly as there, was no need to lower their voices because the party involved was not present. Even so, their tone and expressions became more ridiculous as if they were trying to get rid of their dignity.In the midst of the commotion, Helena asked innocently, fluttering her silver eyelashes as if she knew nothing.\u201cBut I heard that Lady Mis\u00e9rian broke up. Right, Alec?\u201dAt the words spoken by the only person who was allowed to call Crown Prince Alecto by his nickname, the people again stiffened.Alecto missed the timing to respond to those innocent eyes. If he answers with \u2018no\u2019, then Helena becomes a mistress at that moment.The timely reply was an unspoken affirmation. People noticed that Helena was wearing her purple clothes, This was because people who were not members of the royal family cannot use purple arbitrarily.No matter how close she was to the crown prince, she looked too expensive and splendid to be called his nanny\u2019s daughter, and above all else, the manners of her body were close to that of the royal family.\u2018If someone had been intentionally taught imperial etiquette, it was obvious why. It was to make her a future member of the imperial family, and now the only unmarried person in the imperial family was the crown prince.\u201cThen the Crown Princess will become Lady Antebellum?\u201dShe said she was engaged, but the engagement was just an engagement. This was because, technically, Eris was not yet married to the prince.The marriage of the crown prince, who would become the future emperor, was treated as an importantnational event, and it was a loophole that occurred because it was made in accordance with domestic and foreign circumstances.There were cases where the marriage was broken, like when the fianc\u00e9 finds a major flaw, but it was a rare case even if you looked at the history of the empire because the fianc\u00e9e became the de facto crown princess.\u201cI mean, wasn\u2019t Lady Mis\u00e9rian a bit vicious? Sometimes, she intimidated and daunted people\u2026. She was very selfish with her father and the imperial family behind her!\u201d\u201cIt was her hobby to tease and chase people who couldn\u2019t please her\u2026. To become the mother of the Empire, she has to be respectful and kind like Lady Antebellum.\u201d\u201cHis Highness also favors Lady Antebellum more, isn\u2019t it rather good?\u201dPeople were excited and joked around with their mouths.Jason\u2019s face, hearing all the gossip, became more and more complicated.Helena blinked her eyes in embarrassment at the unexpected reaction, but she soon gave up on refuting once more. Because that\u2019s what she had always gone through.People who already have stereotypes won\u2019t listen to Helena no matter how much she tells the truth Instead, it just places one more stereotype on Helena, With the words, \u2018It\u2019s because you\u2019re kind\u2019. (QC/N: think of \u2018stereotype\u2019 as \u2018assumptions\u2019 or \u2018impressions\u2019 in this case.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Helena looked at Alecto with concern, not forgetting to reassure him with hand gestures.The door opened with the maid\u2019s announcement that Alecto was coming in. A white-haired Kratos stood near the window. With his back towards Alecto, he asked in a quiet voice.\u201cI heard that you took your nanny\u2019s daughter to the debutante ball. Are you crazy?\u201dIn fact, it was more of a scream than a question. Kratos shook his head and said to Alecto.To capture Eris Mis\u00e9rian again.\u201cWhatever you do, make a wish or beg, tie her back next to you!\u201dAlecto responded gloomily at Kratos, who was angry but never looked back.\u201cI heard that my mother allowed me to break up with Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201c\u2026Melpomene?\u201d\u201cYes, the child recklessly insisted on breaking up the marriage first. Do you know how troubling it was because of everything she\u2019s been doing? And yet the Marquis and His Majesty cover it, and as the day goes on, her arrogance is getting worse\u2026\u201dAlecto sighed loudly as if he had a headache and spoke as if criticizing Kratos. His, at first, calm voice grew louder and louder, and in the end, he got angry at Kratos.\u201cThe Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian is clever, you told me that I should be wary. But then why do you keep the Marquis close to you! Even now, the Marquis and his child are so complacent, what if she marries me and becomes lonely?\u201dKratos finally looked back at Alecto. He had a younger face than his peers, but it was also difficult to guess his age because of the tiredness around his eyes and the white hair. He suddenly changed his voice and soothed Alecto.\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t understand your heart? Never trust the Marquis, but keep him by your side. The same goes for that child.\u201dKratos made up an infinitely friendly voice, but the eyes were indifferent. He treated Alecto as if he was treating his servant, not looking at his son.That\u2019s why Alecto had never looked straight at Kratos. No, it was closer to not being able to look.Because he was always afraid of Kratos.\u201cEris Mis\u00e9rian is a hostage, shield and faithful servant.\u201dKratos was a man who was skilled at holding and shaking other people\u2019s hearts better than anyone else, He tied his beloved woman to his side with that talent, dropped the vast empire into his grasp, and gripped the enemies who tried to break him down.\u201cYour mother was born and raised as an empress, so she was able to endure, but Helena Antebellum is different. Do you think that a fragile and good child will be able to hold out in this scary imperial palace where even your strong mother could not endure?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that difficult for Kratos to make one of his sons act according to his will.Above all, Alecto was always scared when he stood in front of Kratos. Kratos patted his son on the shoulder.\u201cHelena Antebellum is perfect if you let her in as a concubine and love her. There is no need to put the child as a Crown Princess and make things dangerous.\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201d\u201cWhat if the Marquis tries to assassinate her because of resentment right now? As you said, he is a clevermarquis. Can you guarantee that you will completely block all those attempts?\u201dAlecto\u2019s mouth shut up at the words. It was more of resignation than conviction. Above all, however, Alecto was not confident in himself.Will he be able to go against his father and marquis and protect the woman he loves? Alecto quietly asked Kratos.\u201cThen what should I do? Not only does everyone think that Eris and I have broken up, but they will also avoidme.\u201dPerhaps Eris also appeared with another partner at the debutante ball aiming for this. The emperor thought for a moment and said calmly.\u201cI will bring Eris Mis\u00e9rian to the palace in my honor, r*pe that child then.\u201dAlecto\u2019s eyes opened wide at the shocking remark. Even though he clenched his hands until they turned white, Kratos continued to speak softly.\u201cIf we sow the seeds of the imperial family, she will never be able to break the marriage.\u201d\u201cBut!\u201d\u201cQuiet. I\u2019m not saying this as a father, this is an imperial order.\u201dIs he going to refuse an imperial order? Alecto kept his mouth shut and resisted. It was because Alecto had the least amount of morality left.However, resisting in silence was always limited. He had to nod reluctantly at the cold gaze. As he left the room, Alecto saw the nail marks left on his palm.At that time, Alecto first thought that he should increase his strength. And he realized why his father was so obsessed with power.Not only for the loved ones but also for those who you don\u2019t love, you must have power to protect them.That strength was sometimes needed, not in order to sin, but in order not to sin.In the room where Alecto had left, Kratos reflected on what Alecto said. It was said that his wife, Melpomene, allowed Eris Mis\u00e9rian to break up the marriage.Is it Eris Miserian\u2019s bluff? However, for impersonating the imperial family, she could have been punished for contempt of the imperial family. Eris Mis\u00e9rian could not take that risk.Melpomene didn\u2019t discuss it with him. Why?The debutante ball must have ended. While resting for a while, I tried to figure out the identity of \u2018tears\u2019 the last clue that the witch had told me. At first, thought it had a metaphorical meaning.But for that, this crystal bottle in my hand looked too much like a bottle that holds liquid.Even the size looked like a cosmetic sample container, so it was not for a lot of liquid, it had just enough capacity for tears.Firstly, because I am the only one who must escape from this world, I stabbed myself in the eye. I carefully put the tears that flowed due to the physiological reactions in the bottle, but nothing happened.I wondered if the quantity was insufficient, so by using additional measures such as yawning, I filled it up, but it was the same.I thought it was because of my tears, so I poked Anakin\u2019s eyes next. I was a little sorry for Anakin, but couldn\u2019t help it. Because I could confidently say that in this place, the person closest to me emotionally was Anakin.Well, it was a romance fantasy novel, so I wondered if it required the tears of a loved one.However, contrary to my expectations, nothing happened even if I filled it with Anakin\u2019s tears. Was it because it was forced tears? I\u2019m not an actor and I didn\u2019t want to cry, and I couldn\u2019t cry thinking about sad things.I should build up some knowledge first. I thought it would be helpful if I searched through books, so started looking for them by going in and out of the bookstores on the street, after searching the mansion\u2019s.Well, the most popular thing was definitely the tears of a mermaid. Come to think of it, the name of the gemstone in the Rundol region was also the tears of a fairy.But both were solid, so I thought it wouldn\u2019t be the tears I was looking for. She wouldn\u2019t have told me to powder the solid and put it in a bottle.There were many legends and tales related to tears, but there was no time to trace every legend and tale. asked the maid and she said that the tears of the moon, the tears of god and the tears of the dragon were so famous that everyone knew.The story of the tears of the moon that I read in the book is roughly as follows. There was a boy a long time ago.The boy sought all the best medicines to cure his father\u2019s illness, but none of them worked for the boy\u2019s father. With the feeling of grabbing straws, the boy headed to the temple.As the boy prayed earnestly every day, a priest who was proud of such a boy gave him a hint. It was said that if he feeds his father the tears of the moon, he may get better.The boy tried to save the moon\u2019s tears with all his might, but in the first place, he could not reach the moon in the sky, and it was not crying.The boy, who moved his body nonstop, fell down onto the grass in despair. When the boy couldn\u2019t get up, he fell asleep and when he woke up, it was wet everywhere.The boy suddenly collected dew from the leaves. Then he ran straight to the house and moistened his father\u2019s lips.Soon after, the boy\u2019s father slowly opened his eyes, and the two hugged emotionally. It was a very conventional story that the tears of the moon were actually dew.But I didn\u2019t think the witch would ask me to bring the dew that was so common around me.Then next were the tears of god. If the moon\u2019s tears were dew, I wondered if god\u2019s tears were rain, but I guess not.No, in the first place, I was a little puzzled as I knew that the god of this world was the writer. Is it the writer\u2019s tears? Or does another god exist?Anyway, the legend related to god\u2019s tears began like this. There was a girl.The girl, who had no family, always lived her own way, She wasn\u2019t arrogant, but she was fearless and had nothing to lose because she didn\u2019t have anything. The world made the girl a god.The girl who became a god was no different.She still lived her own way, but unlike before, the world was greatly influenced by each of her actions.At every word she brought up, people trembled, and at each thought, heaven and earth fluctuated. The girl didn\u2019t think it mattered, but the humans did.They brought everything for the girl. Expensive treasures, spices, silk, fresh honey and fruits, as well as the world\u2019s most beautiful men and women were selected to serve the girl. It was intended so that the girl would be drunk on happiness and not have any thoughts.The girl who had a lot in an instant was really happy. When the girl was happy, the world became peaceful and the powerful people of the country constantly paid tribute to the girl so that she would continue to be happy and learn joyfully. One day, however, the tragedy began when the girl became aware of love,Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how precious it might be, not only did the girl have it, but he was also truly a good person by nature.The two lived happily, but there was a limit to the lifespan of a person. The girl tried her best to prolong the life of her lover, but her lover refused it. Her lover said that he was happy. He thanked her too. He even said that he would love her even if he was reborn. And then her lover quietly closed his eyes.The girl could not believe the death of her lover. It was hard for her to accept that she had lost him. The girl who was a god began to cry. No one could comfort her.The girl stopped crying only after a thousand years and a thousand months. The girl who only planted one tree in the world, sprinkled all the tears she had ever shed on that treeThe tree, which drank the girl\u2019s tears, grew big, and the girl, who watched the fruit grow on the tree, finally melted and disappeared.The shape of the fruit looked exactly like a teardrop, and people began to call it the tears of god.I needed to find the fruit called tears of god. It was close to a legendary fruit, so no one knew what it wasIt\u2019s not really a fruit, but rather, an idiom used in this world. When lovers swear to each other that their love is true, they would say, \u2018I will swear on the Tears of God\u2019.Finally, the dragon\u2019s tears were the tears of a real dragon. According to one theory, those who drink the dragon\u2019s tears will have their wishes come true. No, regardless of its authenticity, I was at a loss at having to meet the dragon.In the case of Jason, I think he was able to meet it because he was influenced by the dragon to come to him.Did the witch really want the dragon\u2019s tears? But ! thought it might be the case since she was a witch. She was always cooking something in the basement and she might need some magic ingredients.It was said that the tears of a dragon could make wishes come true, so it might have the power to transcend the world.Anyway, in order to meet the dragon, I had to go to the witch. Because I thought one had to be a witch to know where the dragon was. She\u2019ll take me to the dragon\u2019s place, or at least show me the place.I was getting ready to go out after a long time. I didn\u2019t know because the heating in the house was always plenty, but now I felt that it was very chilly at the beginning of winter.Anakin went to Kynthia\u2019s house to stock up firewood, so I went out alone for the first time in a long time.I was worried if I had dressed properly.I put on a thick scarf and got out of my carriage. As was walking for a bit down the alley I always went to, made eye contact with Hubris. It was the first time since we parted ways in BoniteoI deliberately avoided it, but even in the novel, Eris and Hubris had a hard time meeting each other by chance. One is a lady of a noble family with a fianc\u00e9e, and the other is a high priest.His face was somewhat emaciated, but instead of looking sunken, his unique sexiness only deepened. I thought it would be embarrassing to say hello to each other, so I tried to pass by. However, Hubris promptly grabbed my wrist.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWait a minute\u2026 Please give me some time.\u201d\u201cNo. Let go.\u201dAh, why are you all taking turns behaving badly?! didn\u2019t feel like he was worth dealing with, so I tried to shake it off, but my wrist was held tightly by that skinny body which was very strong.If I had known this would happen, I would have just gone to Kynthia\u2019s house with Anakin and came back. I said I was going on a market day, but I was unlucky.He tilted his head, crookedly, and began to stare at me like a venomous snake, but after hesitating with an uneasy expression on his face, Hubris finally spat out words.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026 I keep thinking about you.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cCan I keep thinking of you?\u201d\u201cNo. If you have heard the answer, move away.\u201dI shook his arm off and went the way I was going, but this time, he hugged me as he pleased. He is really making me tired. It\u2019s a deserted alley, but I don\u2019t know what others are going to do if they see this.I lifted my foot slightly to kick the delicate part with my knee, but my shoulder was wet. Is he crying?\u201cTo me\u2026.don\u2019t be so harsh.\u201dAt least he didn\u2019t talk like Jason, in comparison to him, I was obviously looking at Hubris. In the first place, don\u2019t know why we\u2019re filming a melodrama by ourselves, even though we aren\u2019t in a relationship which allows it to slide. Besides, is it okay for a high priest who has to keep his chastity to be like this?\u201cSir.\u201d\u201cCall me Hubris.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it. High Priest, you reach out to the world, as a person that worships God. I\u2019ll pretend that nothing happened today so go home now.\u201dAs I looked up at Hubris, tears fell from his face and flowed down my cheeks. He was looking at me sadly, perhaps not even paying attention to my cold attitude. He pleaded with me almost in a hoarse voice.\u201cI\u2019m not even allowed to look\u2026?\u201dEven if I\u2019m misunderstood as having an ax disease by saying this, I\u2019ll have to ask.(PR/N: \u2018ax disease\u2019 is a figurative disease where the person believes everybody has a crush on him/her, it\u2019s a play on the word \u2018//\u2019 which means \u2018to swing an ax ( ly\u2019 and also a slang for to have a crush on someone.)\u201cSir, do you like me?\u201dHe opened his eyes wide at my words and whispered, softly with a face as if he was almost dying.\u201c\u2026Yes, I dare to\u2026\u201dBefore he could say anything more, I stabbed Hubris with my words.\u201cDo you know that Eris Mis\u00e9rian is your half-sister?\u201dHubris was startled by my words and shook his head violently. He ripped off his hair in disbelief, looked at me and shouted.\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be!\u201d\u201cI think I am right. Do you really want to go to the Marquis and check it out? Shall we go now?\u201dHubris, who had repeatedly muttered \u2018sister\u2019 with a pale complexion, said to me, squeezing his face as if he was out of his mind.\u201cBut\u2026 you\u2019re not Eris Mis\u00e9rian, are you?\u201d\u201cSo? My soul is not Eris Mis\u00e9rian, but will you commit incest?\u201dHa, I laughed at myself. Hubris was noticeably intimidated by that sight. I was dumbfounded and retorted.\u201cEven if that\u2019s the case, you of all people shouldn\u2019t be the one to do that. You\u2019re the high priest. You swore to God to be celibate.\u201dHe looked really hurt.He staggered as if he was about to fall like a stabbed man, but I did not support him. If you\u2019re going to die, then die.His idea was disgusting. Is it okay because it\u2019s a different soul? Knowing that it\u2019s your sister\u2019s body? How come you only think of yourself until the end?Passing by Hubris who was blankly standing on the side of the road, I finally knocked on the door to the witch\u2019s shop. There were no signs of movement inside, but just in case, I pushed the door and it opened slowly.But there wasn\u2019t any presence. There was no witch in the basement I used to go to, so I went up again and looked around the store slowly.I originally liked to browse around stores. I especially liked stores with a lot of little items, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to look around the witch\u2019s store properly until now because I was either busy or because the witch had guided me.From a gigantic music box in which dozens of dolls danced as a group, to an antique brass celestial sphere that projects stars when turned, and a snow globe that shoots Tinkerbell\u2019s golden powder like firecrackers when shaken.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But in fact, like a witch whom everyone believes to be fake is real, how many of the stories I\u2019ve read are genuine and how many are false?Medea opened her mouth after thinking for a while,\u201cStrictly speaking, it\u2019s all true.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe tears of the moon were a little exaggerated, but to be precise, he was able to survive by being fed the pollen-stained dew of medicinal herbs, and dragon tears have the effect of making a wish come true. If it\u2019s a wish that fits the laws of nature. Well\u2026 at least it\u2019s definitely going to be effective for rain rituals.\u201d\u201cWhat about the tears of god?\u201dMedea stopped talking for a while and then said.\u201cThe tree is in the witch\u2019s realm.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really? There was a god?\u201d\u201cAh, because she was a witch, not a god. She matured when there were only a few witches, so there was no witch to let her know that she was a witch.\u201dA witch?! Just by listening to her words, a witch was like a being who could do anything\u2026. it was not strange to mistake her for a god.\u201cHer name was Lilith, the other witches who belatedly discovered Lilith respected her desire to be reborn and killed her, causing her to be reborn again. But being born is not in the witches\u2019 domain, so they had to get some help from the dragons.\u201d(QC/N: domain\u2019 as in \u2018ability\u2019 or \u2018what they can touch/manipulate\u2019.)\u201cDidn\u2019t you have a bad relationship with the dragons?\u201d\u201cThey promised to hand over half of the fruit that Lilith grew to the dragons. If you eat that fruit, your fertility will be very high\u2026. Anyway, the trees are well protected by dragons and witches. So that it\u2019s not seen by humans.\u201dI asked sharply as I felt something steaming.\u201cSo, what\u2019s up with the tears?\u201d\u201cIt has a metaphorical meaning or existence. Just as everything does.\u201d\u201cAre you a sphinx? You\u2019re not going to play riddles with me now, are you?\u201d\u201cHu-hoo, don\u2019t get too nervous because you\u2019ll find out on your own when the time comes.\u201dHow can I not be nervous! What if I can\u2019t find it until I die? The moment I got annoyed at Medea\u2019s reckless reply that it wasn\u2019t her business and when I was about to say something, she opened the cards in her hand as if to appease me. It\u2019s not even a magic show, but where did you get those cards?\u201cRight, do you want to have a look?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe in superstitions.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t do that you\u2019re supposed to watch all of these for fun, right?\u201d\u201cIs it okay for a witch to say that?\u201dEven though I was grumbling, I sat on the opposite side of the small table where she sat. Medea flew the cards in the air and mixed them up. The cards that naturally shuffled as if dancing looked like a performance.\u201cWhat would you like to see?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you, please just look moderately. Well\u2026 it would be nice if it was about the future.\u201d\u201cHmm, good. Please pick a card.\u201dI caught one of the flying cards. When I turned it upside down, it looked terrifying. There was something like a sheep\u2019s horn and\u2026\u2026.\u201cDeath in the front\u2026\u201dWhen she saw my card, the witch\u2019s face became serious. She grabbed one of the cards that were flying and turned it upside down. It was a card with a big moon. She swept her hair back and told me seriously.\u201cDon\u2019t go around alone, okay?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you mean? Why didn\u2019t you tell me that before we started?\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of variables like this. It\u2019s no use, hearing it won\u2019t make a difference. What\u2019s certain is that you shouldn\u2019t be alone. Your knight\u2026.. Put him next to you under any circumstances.\u201dMedea scared me a lot, but I just laughed it off. Maybe she just wanted to tease me, and because Anakin was always by my side anyway, there is no way I\u2019ll be alone. I shrugged and said okay.Then I suddenly thought of my love fortune.Hmm, I don\u2019t usually believe in this, but it\u2019s not bad to try it once for fun. I did something slightly different and hinted at the witch.\u201cI want to see my love fortune\u2026 too.\u201d\u201cWith the knight?\u201d\u201cWho said it\u2019s with Anakin?!\u201d\u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201dI was a bit intimidated because I felt guilty. I\u2019m doomed. As I looked into the witch\u2019s eyes, she smiled brightly. While fiddling with the cards, she just placed her hand on my hand across from her.\u201cI know it\u2019s more than a love affair.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it? Is it some kind of spell?\u201d\u201cWell, if it\u2019s magic, it could be a spell.\u201dAs I was pricking up my ears, the witch smiled and shook her hand lightly to burst the flame. There was a small sound of fireworks popping.\u201cThere will be a fireworks display tonight to celebrate the graduation of the National Academy students. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to see a great view rather than a love fortune that only tells you obvious things?\u201d\u201cFireworks\u2026\u201dI was a little tempted. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve been busy while living in Korea, so I\u2019ve never seen fireworks before. So what if fireworks exploded in Yeouido every year, I had no time.However, I was worried that there would be a lot of people. No matter how good the view was, I hate getting caught in between people and suddenly being knocked around here and there.The witch hinted that she knew about my worries,\u201cIf you don\u2019t like people, you can go directly to the academy and watch it.\u201d\u201cThe academy would be off limits to outsiders.\u201d\u201cWell, half of Lady Mis\u00e9rian isn\u2019t an outsider, right?\u201dMedea added, wrinkling her nose at me, who was puzzled.\u201cThe Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian is one of the biggest sponsors of the academy, so won\u2019t they let you in?\u201dA man who was no help during her lifetime was useful in strange places.Putting on my dark golden coat, Anakin and I got off the wagon where people from the academy were waiting.They told us to come this way, quietly leading the way. The students passing by glanced at the two of us, but it didn\u2019t bother me much because in middle and high school, everyone does this when an outsider enters.It was like an outdoor balcony overlooking the whole view of the school. I don\u2019t know if it was thermal insulation magic or some kind of magic engineering, but it wasn\u2019t too cold even though it was outside. Sitting side by side in a chair, we put the prepared refreshments in our mouths.Soon, a group of people wearing thick capes came out and lifted something like a cane embedded with jewels. Then a flame was fired from the end of the jewel.Bang, bang\u2026 The sparks that glowed brilliantly with the sound drew attention by themselves. When I saw it in pictures or videos, I thought it was tacky and not very pretty, but it felt different in person. The colorful lights and the falling sparks were dazzlingly beautiful.Anakin was also watching the fireworks frantically, as it was the first time he saw fireworks. Unconsciously I grabbed Anakin\u2019s hand on his lap. When Anakin looked at me, I clenched my fist and opened it.My hands were sweaty. Even though I had hesitated for quite a long time, Anakin waited without rushing me. I love you like that.\u201cHey, Anakin\u2026 do you know?\u201dI know I shouldn\u2019t say it. But I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have a chance unless it was now.\u201cI want you\u2026\u201dBoom boom!At that moment, a roar rang and the ground shook. Anakin quickly held me in his arms and protected me from the explosion. People\u2019s screams rang out. When I couldn\u2019t get myself together due to the shock, Anakin lifted me up, hugging me. It was then.\u201cIt\u2019s a monster! A monster has appeared!\u201dA hole opened in the sky and winged creatures came pouring out. There seemed to be hundreds of them.When one of them rushed to us, Anakin kicked his tongue, pulled out a sword with one hand and cut it down. Sticky green blood poured out.\u201cClose the gate!\u201d Belatedly, the magic engineers closed the hole through which the monsters came out of, but there were already too many. Was this the witch\u2019s fortune telling?In the midst of my confusion, pulling away from Anakin with my staggering legs, I said.\u201cI can walk alone. Anakin, escort me. A carriage\u2026 No can a carriage come now? Let\u2019s get out of here first.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dStudents poured out of the building in order to see if they had been called. They quickly evacuated peoplenear the exit and locked the door firmly, perhaps they had received preparatory training in this regard.\u201cIs the magic field far away?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fully charged! 5 seconds left! 4 seconds left! 3 seconds left! 2 seconds left! 1 second left!\u201dThere was the sound of the heavy chains being loosened, and light bursting out from the top of the spire in the center. The light exploded like a fountain and soon created a huge tent to block the entire, academy as if wrapping it.When I stopped walking because of the sight, Anakin slashed the attacking monster and grabbed my hand to lead me.Anyway, how do we get out of this confinement? Anakin looked back at me and spoke, perhaps knowing that I was anxious.\u201cYou\u2019ll get out safely. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dYeah, Anakin was still incomplete, but he was a sword master. There will be a way out of here somehow.At that time, the monsters that were being destroyed, by the students one by one began to mumble and merge into one. Then, they came together into a huge shape and melted the surrounding area as quickly as possible.\u201cGet away!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cSave me!\u201d\u201cGet out of my way!\u201dPeople\u2019s screams burst from place to place, adding to the confusion. Usually, people who would have avoided Lady Mis\u00e9rian were busy running away, whether they bumped into her or not.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 56Suspicious ActsThe sight of terrified people kept drawing my attention. Should I help them? As I was hesitating once more due to pity, Anakin said quietly.\u201cI\u2019ll go if Master orders it. I\u2019ll probably be able to defeat it\u2026.. but my master\u2019s safety is my top priority.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can the academy defeat that?\u201d\u201cMagic Engineers are not just people who do research. They are also trained for war in case of emergencies. Right now, they are just bewildered by the sudden situation, but they will find a solution soon.\u201dThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s the two of us that matter. They\u2019ll catch the monster on their own. There is no need for me and my Anakin to go out.\u201c\u2026Yeah. Then\u2026 let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI accidentally found something that looked like a pistol rolling around on the floor. Someone must have dropped it because they were confused. I picked it up without thinking about it and hid it in my arms. It might be useful if I picked it up.We quickly descended the stairs and headed for the back door of the academy. The door was open, but the magic field was a problem.After touching the round magic field that surrounded us for a moment, Anakin grabbed his sword and caught his breath. A delicate blackness fluttered over Anakin\u2019s sword.He concentrated and slashed the magic field with a single move. Anakin, who made the hole, sent me out first and then followed.As soon as Anakin came out, the hole in the magic field was filled again.While we were looking at it, our eyes met someone that was watching us from over the magic field. In the meantime, the person ran away into the academy.Who was it? My heart was freaking out. Even when I tried to think that he would just be a student at the academy, a corner of my heart kept on worrying.\u201cDid you leave something behind? Shall I go back?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 no. Let\u2019s go, Anakin. As soon as possible.\u201dBad premonitions were not always wrong, but wanted it to be this time. I grabbed Anakin\u2019s hand and ran down the back road.There was a lot of commotion outside the academy because of the few monsters that had escaped before the magic field was cast.Because of the people running out to the carriages, it seemed difficult even for a horse to run. Anakinpondered for a moment, then knelt down on his knees and positioned his back towards me.\u201cI\u2019ll carry you on my back.\u201d\u201cWhat? I can run!\u201d\u201cI know. But you have to run non-stop to the mansion For many reasons, it will be better for me to carry you on my back.\u201dOf all things, I was wearing shoes with some heels, not flat shoes. If I have to run to the mansion, not walk, will never be able to endure it and will collapse.I chose it because I thought I would ride a carriage when I went back, but it was useless to blame myself from the past.I didn\u2019t know if the monster might appear right away, but I couldn\u2019t waste time here, so I let Anakin carry me without hesitation. Anakin put his wrists on my thighs and got up.\u201cIf I run, it will shake a lot and it will be very uncomfortable. Please be patient.\u201dAnd he started running at a fairly fast pace, but unlike me, who was gasping even after a little run, he didn\u2019t slow down.It was when I could see the outer gate leading into the mansion. Suddenly, I heard a strange cry, so I grabbed Anakin\u2019s shoulder and turned my head.A monster was flying towards us at high speed. Anakin couldn\u2019t raise his sword because he was carrying me. unconsciously pulled out the gun from my arms.And shouted to Anakin.\u201cAnakin! Turn around!\u201dAnakin immediately turned to my command, and with my legs tightly wrapped around his waist, I pointed the gun at the monster.I pressed the hammer that stuck out, gripped the pistol firmly with both hands and pulled the trigger. Bang! At the sound, a magic sphere went out instead, of a bullet, but it was wrongly aimed.Without a moment of regret, I pulled the trigger again. Bang! This time I also missed. I\u2019ve never shot a gun in my life, it was only natural, so I gritted my teeth.Please, please, please! If I don\u2019t get it right this time, it\u2019s over. I pulled the trigger one last time when it was almost in front of me. Bang!The monster\u2019s head exploded in front of my eyes.Thank God. I\u2019m really happy. My hands were shaking and I dropped the gun, but neither of us cared and ran again.When we managed to reach the mansion, Anakin bent his tired legs, and I headed to the bathroom with my trembling legs while supported by the maids.After a brief bath, I came out and suddenly there was a commotion downstairs. I looked down with my wet hair, wondering what was going on, and it was the Imperial Palace Knights.\u201cMarquis Mis\u00e9rian is urgently arrested on charges of opening the gate without permission and unlocking demonic monsters at the Academy Graduation Ceremony! Marquis, hurry up and get dressed!\u201d\u201cThere seems to be some misunderstanding, and I need to see His Majesty right now. I\u2019ll explain it to His Majesty directly.\u201d\u201cCarnival Mis\u00e9rian! The culprit who opened the gate with your fortune has already been arrested! How dare you want an audience with His Majesty when the gold coins you gave him in the yard were also obtained as proof!\u201d(QC/N: I think that\u2019s his name. If I\u2019m not mistaken + based on later sentences.)The marquis gritted his teeth in response to the knights\u2019 statements. He seemed to barely hold back what he wanted to shout.However, knowing that any further fuss was meaningless, he changed his clothes and quietly followed the knights out the door. The attendants were whispering and stomping their feet.Something was suspicious. The marquis was one of the academy\u2019s biggest patrons. Of course, his support of the academy was not in the public interest.That was because, in addition to opening up connections with people who are the talents of the country and could become powerful people in the future, he could also implicitly pressure them.If he did so, he could permanently lose the sponsorship of the academy, the goose that lays golden eggs, so would he open the gate and raid the imperial palace?The marquis was not such a reckless person, and there was no return benefit for the marquis.The real culprit was different and he wanted to cover it up with the marquis. Since monster terrorism was not productive, the purpose may have been to eliminate the marquis.The marquis had too many political enemies. Who would have thought of that, even if I tried to think about it, there were more than one or two.I kept getting worried about the one that came out of the academy today and found Anakin and I.It was as if my intuition was telling me that he was the culprit.I thought about it until my hair was dry, but I couldn\u2019t come up with an answer.Since he\u2019s the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian with great resourcefulness, he\u2019ll get out of it somehow. As I was trying to relax and lie down, I suddenly heard a knock on the door again. When the maid opened the door, the attendant, who had been carrying an Imperial Order, was guided by the head maid and came to me,\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian. There is testimony that you were in the academy at the time of today\u2019s incident, is that true?\u201d\u201c\u2026I went there with a personal escort to watch the fireworks.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty has ordered you to attend the palace because he has some questions regarding the charges against Marquis Carnival Mis\u00e9rian. Please get dressed quickly.\u201dTo be honest, I was scared, but at times like these shouldn\u2019t make it obvious. I politely nodded my head, stood up from my seat and said to my maid.\u201cTell Anakin to get ready for the palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you going to enter the palace with a personal escort? The Imperial Palace Knights will escort you.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they the \u2018Imperial Palace Knights\u2019? I feel comfortable with my escort.\u201dI asked the servant, who seemed somehow troubled, with a smile on my face.\u201cAm I not allowed to take my escort? I\u2019m not a suspect anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026No. The lord\u2019s daughter can do what is comfortable for her.\u201dAnakin got ready and came out at the maid\u2019s call. I got into the carriage and looked around the road leading to the Imperial Palace, but it was quiet as if everything had already been organized. As if they knew this was going to happen.Did the imperial palace not notice something that even I could easily deduce? I suddenly thought of that People who want to get rid of the marquis, people who will not be harmed even if they open the gate, and summon monsters, people who know all of this and can get things sorted out quickly\u2026.The real culprit is one of the royal family members. The emperor, the empress, the crown prince. Which one of the three is it?The empress and the crown prince originally had a deep resentment towards the marquis. However, it\u2019s impossible to exclude the emperor from the list of suspects, one of the emperor\u2019s biggest politicalopponents was the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian. It\u2019s been a while since they called a truce and held hands.Why did he want to investigate when the marquis had already been determined to be the culprit? Why did he call for me? There were more than a couple of doubts that arose.But now I couldn\u2019t get off the carriage. Even if I fell, I couldn\u2019t escape. I clenched my fists and hid my trembling hands.\u201cGet off, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201dI got off the carriage and went into the room led by the attendant. When Anakin tried to follow in, the servant stopped him.\u201cHis Majesty will be arriving soon. This is not a place for an escort to join.\u201d\u201cBut-\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, His Majesty will not be accompanied by a knight either. Please understand.\u201dI couldn\u2019t be stubborn in saying that. Above all, now that the marquis was taken into the palace, I, the daughter of the marquis, would not benefit from refusing an imperial order.Anyway, if anything happened, Anakin would run to me if I whispered even a little, so it was fine.Alone in the room, I sat on the sofa, drank tea and waited. Looking around, it was closer to a bedroom than a drawing room, because there was a bed behindAfter a while, the door opened.\u201cI see Your Majesty.\u201dWhen I finished speaking and looked up, the man at the door was not the emperor, but Alecto.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After Young Lady Kazar\u2019s debutante ball, I thought there would be nothing to see now.I didn\u2019t say anything officially, but it was practically a broken engagement notice. This is because \u2018a fiance\u2019s lover\u2019 was not just a flaw.The empire was stricter than expected because the pope was not the first power, but anyway, it was a state with diplomatic relations. Having a lover secretly after marriage was acceptable, but not before marriage. That\u2019s why the crown prince tried to break up the engagement with me.Even if he had a lover before marriage, he had to bury her under the water, by denying that they are \u2018friends in front of people. An affair before marriage was treated as a strict reason for disqualification, and in severe cases, he could be questioned about his faithfulness and even be forced into a religious trial.The Mis\u00e9rian family is the backbone of the aristocratic family, and the imperial family doesn\u2019t want things to get bigger because of Helena\u2019s presence, so they probably won\u2019t send me to the religious trials\u2026\u2026..Still, I didn\u2019t know. This gate incident alone was the same. From the imperial side, a plan can be used to take down the Miserian family altogether.I barely raised the corners of my lips to the crown prince, hiding my thoughts.\u201cYour Highness, what are you doing here? If you have something to say, I will visit the palace again next time\u2026\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is not coming.\u201dThe crown prince declared. Somehow, in the midst of my doubts, there was a chill up my spine. It felt like! had to hurry home, like the anxiety I felt when I looked up at the dark sky from time to time.\u201cThen it\u2019s late, so if you don\u2019t have anything else to say, I\u2019ll leave.\u201dHowever, despite my greetings, the crown prince walked towards me expressionlessly, so I stood up to avoid him and stepped back.With every step I took, my heart was pounding and was sweating profusely.\u201cBefore, you said that I was not engaged to you, but to the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian. You too, are not marrying me, you are marrying the imperial family.\u201dThe crown prince paused for a moment and then returned. He looked kind of in pain. I had a bad hunch, a very bad hunch. I moistened my dry lips and looked into his eyes. The distance to the door was too far.\u201cYou\u2019ll get married even if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dWhy are you saying this? Cold sweat dripped from my hands. My wet, wet hands gripped my skirt. As I was stepping backwards, my heel slammed into a wall, and I realized it was the wall. I instinctively glanced at the window next to me.I was out of breath, so I grabbed the window frame to open the window, but the latch did not turn due to my lack of strength. Even at that moment, the prince was approaching me.\u201cNow I must return those words. You did not marry me, but this imperial family.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t come near me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re getting married, but that our names are married.\u201d\u201cI told you not to come closer.\u201dTwo stories high. I was going to jump if I had to. know it\u2019s a crazy idea, but it feels like I have to do it. Even if I break my legs, it\u2019ll be okay if Anakin hugs me.At last, the latch turned and the window opened, and only then did I catch my breath. I was terrified when I saw the height I would fall from if I were to jump off.The crown prince grabbed my waist like that. As if dancing, my body drew close to him. We stared at each other for a long time. A terrible silence surrounded us. I warned him clearly.\u201cDon\u2019t touch my body\u2026\u201dAttempts to get rid of him were again blocked. The prince held me like that and moved slowly. It was in the direction of the bed.\u201cYour Highness?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201dIf I had a siren in my head, my ears would have been ripped apart by now. Never go alone okay? The witch\u2019s words flashed in my mind. Your knight.. Keep him by your side in any situation.I tried to give strength to my toes somehow. Soft carpets did not allow this. I stretched my arms to grab anything around me and hang onto it. The silk curtain I barely grabbed escaped my hand like a grain of sand.\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Your Highness! Let go, let go!\u201d\u201cEris Mis\u00e9rian.\u201dAll my efforts were lightly ruined by the crown prince holding my back and knees, hugging me. He carefully laid me down on the bed and then looked down quietly.I tried to get up, but my arms kept losing strength, and the crown prince pushed me down again.By that time, I was so scared that tears flowed down my cheeks.\u201cYour Highness, what\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re trying to scare me, right? I\u2019m being arrogant. That\u2019s why, right? That\u2019s enough for me now\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cToday you will have my child. And that will be your shackle.\u201dA clear death sentence was given to the ear that was trying to avoid it. I convulsively tried to get out of the bed, but the crown prince immediately grabbed me by the waist.Shrinking with fear, my throat could not even scream and barely spoke in a rattling voice.\u201cEris Mis\u00e9rian, you can resent me for the rest of yourlife.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Your Highness. Save me, please save me. Your Highness, Your Highness, please\u2026!\u201dWithout a word, he grabbed the laces on my clothes and started pulling them out. No, don\u2019t do it. Somehow, my struggle was blocked, my body firmly caught under the prince\u2019s body.I didn\u2019t know the difference in power would be thisbig.No gap was seen. It was hard to breathe, and it was hard to breathe because my head was dizzy. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared, Anakin.I tried to call out Anakin\u2019s name, but all that came out of my throat was a wheezing, rough breath. My heart was beating too fast.It felt like it was going to explode.No, no, no! As soon as the prince\u2019s hand came under my skirt, my eyes turned bright red.In times like these, it would be nice if you showed up like the prince in the novel. But you are not a prince, and I am not a heroine. It was so unfair.I struggled like a madman, as if I was having a seizure,Kicking, pinching, punching the crown prince\u2026\u2026. Despite being beaten by me, the crown prince was silently continuing his work.I screamed out her name as if squeezing it out.\u201cHelena!\u201d\u201cH, Helena, think of her. Won\u2019t she be ashamed ofyou?\u201dAt that moment, the crown prince lifted his head and clasped my shoulders tightly and looked at me.The eyes that I finally met were dotted with sadness and shame. It was frustrating, and it made me angry. Why are you making that face? It\u2019s like you\u2019re the victim.The prince opened his mouth a few times as if to say something, and then lowered his head. He didn\u2019t tell me any reason. Whatever the reason, there would be no justification for doing this now.Instead of making any excuses, he bowed his head and tried to kiss me. I twisted my head to avoid it, but his lips followed.A groan came out as he tried to push into my lips and bit them tightly with his molars.When my mouth opened due to the physiological nausea, he did not miss the gap. Something unpleasant slipped into my mouth. As I tried to bite,Alecto\u2019s hand gripped my chin tightly. I raised my nails and tried to shake him off, but to no avail.The squealing sound was appalling. Suddenly my body shuddered. He didn\u2019t even bother to take off my clothes anymore. After all, the ultimate purpose of this act was different. I couldn\u2019t even earn a single minute of time.Despair engulfed me like a tidal wave.I was collapsing like a shipwreck engulfed in a wave of helplessness. I wanted to bite my tongue and die, but even more so, knowing that I am not going to die. really can\u2019t do anything like this, like this\u2026\u2026 likethis\u2026..No, I couldn\u2019t end it like this. I couldn\u2019t even call this the end. I had to survive. I had to do anything,Gasp, I took a deep breath and grabbed something in my outstretched right hand. It seemed to be a vase that was usually left on the tabletop. It would have been fine if it wasn\u2019t a vase. Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t matter. If only I could stop this situation now.I held it firmly in my hand so that it did not slip from my trembling hands. Then I swung it at the side of his head at once. With a cracking sound, the crown prince\u2019s hand stopped. I didn\u2019t stop. I told you not to Please, please don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t like it, I even cried at you,What happened after that, well, I don\u2019t know. The memory was clear, but somehow there was no sense of reality. When the vase was broken, the broken pieces left in my hand were stuck in the crown prince\u2019s neck.The feeling of being immersed in the soft, smooth flesh was terrifying. I didn\u2019t have any strength in my body until now, and I didn\u2019t know where I got that strength. It is said that crazy people are strong, but maybe they really went crazy.The crown prince staggered while grabbing his neck, then tried to resist while grabbing my wrist. I bit his wrist with my teeth. We fought over and over again in the same place.I struggled not to lose the piece in my hand. And swung it as much as I could and stabbed the crown prince. In fact, the expression \u2018pushed it in by force\u2019 may be more accurate. The blood that burst like a fountain was scattered across my face.I crazily cut him. Anger and resentment were not the only things that surrounded me.It was closer to a more fundamental fear.I definitely have to finish it now. If the crown prince comes back to life, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do to me. More terrifying things could happen. The primal and desperate self-defense controlled me.Over and over again\u2026\u2026 Until the sound of our breaths subsided and finally the crown prince did not move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 58Kill, or be killedI was sinking under the sea, I was out of breath like a person who had just risen to the surface.Ding- I closed my eyes and gasped, then slowly opened my eyes to the sound of a distant bell. I was the only one living and breathing on the bloodied bed.I threw up the vomit I had been holding in next to the bed. My guts were all turned upside down. Since didn\u2019t eat anything, only a part of the tea I drank earlier flowed back. Still, my mind seemed to be clearer. I gently wiped the corner of my mouth with the back of my hand and caught my breath.DingEven with this mess, people didn\u2019t come in. It must have been because the place where the crown prince was stabbed was the neck, so he couldn\u2019t scream, but it\u2019s probably because they know what\u2019s going to happen in this room.Get pregnant? Just to prevent the breakup? You want me to have a baby even though you don\u2019t love me?I felt dumbfounded, I felt empty, I burst out laughing like a fool because I was so exhausted. My whole body was itchy, so I scratched it. If possible, I want to cut out all the rough skin. Ding \u2013 The sound of the bells of the first lunar month got louder and louder, Oh, I killed a person. To be more precise, the protagonist of this world.I killed Alecto.Jason was definitely a child born out of love. His parents were a rare case of a successful marriage in an aristocratic family, and their eldest son, Jason, was the fruit of the blessing that came shortly after they got married.But the High Priest\u2019s prophecy turned everything into a mess. The fate of the dragon slayer, the prophecy that he was born with the fate of a hero that will save the world, was closer to a curse than a prophecy to Young Master Kazar.Jason could no longer grow up to be Jason. Everyone treated him like a hero.Jason couldn\u2019t do anything childish once and had to harden himself. He couldn\u2019t give his heart to anyone. Because his life was one that may soon die.At night his parents fought. It was because of him.\u2013 It\u2019s not a prophecy! How can humans go against the fate of God!\u2013 Baby, our baby is dying! But what matters is the prophecy that has never been passed down since the founding of the empire\u2026\u2026!\u2013 Shh! Blasphemy. What are you going to do when someone hears you?\u2013 Listen to it if you want! If I am going to die anyway, I will die with my child. Say that to His Majesty. I\u2019m not afraid of the extinction of the family, so don\u2019t threaten my child under the pretext of it!If he doesn\u2019t try, everyone in his family will die. Not only the family, but maybe everyone in the empire will die.Thousands, tens of thousands of lives were laid on the little boy\u2019s shoulders. Unfortunately, Jason could not give up on them. That\u2019s because he was \u2018raised\u2019 like that.Since he could stand on both feet, he had never neglected his training or rested for a single day.Even if his whole body ached and he had a fever, Jason held up his sword.Jason was talented with the sword, and his father, who was his mentor, was one of the best swordsmen in the empire, so Jason reached the top of the sword, faster than anyone else.But the more Jason learned, the more he realized it was impossible to actually kill a dragon. Dragons were not what humans thought of as huge and powerful lizards.The dragon race was closer to nature itself. Even if vou divide the sea and destroy the mountains, it doesn\u2019t kill the sea and the mountains, does it?Jason felt like he was blindly sacrificing himself Breathing was suffocating as every minute seemed to lead him to death. He washed his face with his small, dry hands that have been broken hundreds of times. His rough fingertips were sharp.But even though helplessness and despair engulfed him, Jason could not let go of his sword. As he was laughing at himself, Jason burst into tears.Hi. It was just a word and a laugh.To Jason, who had lived a life by drawing a line in his heart with chalk as white as snow, Helena easily brokein.Was it because she herself was as white as the first snow? He couldn\u2019t figure it out. Even though he tried to keep his distance, Helena kept approaching him with an innocent face.\u2013 Killing a dragon? Awesome!\u2013 \u2026\u2026I might not be able to kill it. It\u2019s a dragon. The best product of God.\u2013 No. You can definitely kill it.While knowing anything, she spat it out easily. Maybe it was easy to say because she didn\u2019t know anything. He will die. Even if he can\u2019t kill the dragon, or even if he is going to kill the dragon, that place will become his tomb.At Helena\u2019s irresponsible words, Jason nervously smacked her hand away.\u2013 You don\u2019t know! What do you believe in to be so sure? Even I can\u2019t be sure, you don\u2019t know anything\u2026.She opened her eyes wide at Jason\u2019s rebuttal and gently touched her smacked hand. In return, Jason regretted that her white hands were red, but he did not dare bring any words out of his mouth.At that time, Jason had never been with people, so he was clumsy in dealing with people. Helena blinked her eyes for a moment at Jason\u2019s question, then tilted her head slightly and smiled Holding Jason\u2019s scarred hand, she affirmed.\u2013 Trust your efforts. You worked harder than anyone else. So it\u2019s clearly possible.Her hands were warm. Jason stared blankly into her eyes. Helena seemed to truly believe that he could. It was not compassion. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026 It was the first time.Everyone who met Jason used to look at him with sympathetic eyes. He still had time, but they acted as if he was going to die at any moment.He was working so hard. He never rested and devoted his entire life to dying, but they didn\u2019t believe it no matter how hard he tried.Everyone thought he couldn\u2019t make it.Even his parents, who would have watched Jason more closely than anyone else, were the same. One day, when they handed over the address of a hideout for him to run away, Jason\u2019s world collapsed.Although everyone needed him, they didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t believe it, but they didn\u2019t want the boy to stop.It was a truly tragic contradiction.Jason\u2019s tears fell silently.Seeing the tears, Helena did not know what to do and she wiped his eyes with her sleeve.He may have been lonely. He drew a line and pushed people away, but the truth was that he needed someone who wouldn\u2019t be pushed out. Jason finally understood.\u2013 Really, really\u2026\u2026? Can / kill the dragon\u2026.. Is it? Can / come back alive?Helena nodded at his stuttering words. Just with that little nod, Jason felt like he was saved.\u2013 Why would your parents have taught you so hard? Because they wanted you to come back alive.He had never thought of it that way. He had never heard a word of kindness and was resentful at them for not reaching out their hand kindly.Even as he whined that he wanted to rest, they were stern. He just thought that the daily routine where only training was repeated was boring and painful.When he fell, they taught him to get up on his own without lifting him. When there was a wound, they did not heal it, but taught him the efficacy of herbs and how to make medicine. What are edible and what are poisonous and should be avoided\u2026. Taught him geography and culture so that he can adapt wherever he goes.The family loved him and raised him strongly. They wanted him to kill the dragon and come back \u2018alive\u2019 so that he wouldn\u2019t really die.Is it okay if I dare to love someone?Jason asked himself for the first time.Jason still didn\u2019t believe he could kill a dragon However, since Helena was the only one who believed that he could live, Jason decided to live for Helena for the rest of his life if he survived.He occasionally saw the shadow of a great dragon. It felt like it\u2019s the dragon\u2019s secret warning that he would destroy his homeland if he didn\u2019t leave soon.However, since he did not know the dragon\u2019s location, Jason had no choice but to take a vague step forward.He actually wanted to run away half way through. He was afraid of death. Yes, he still wanted to live. There were people he wanted to meet in his life. Even if he ran away like that, if he put his mind to it, no one would find him.\u201cBrother\u2026\u2026Can you help me?\u2019It was then. A boy spoke to him. Jason looked back at the child as if he had seen a ghost. The child recklessly grabbed Jason\u2019s clothes and led him. When the child\u2019s request was granted, a clue was given about the dragon.Whenever Jason wanted to escape, such people constantly appeared to help Jason, and Jason helped them.It was as if fate was guiding him, that he had to kill the dragon. As he was rushing through life like that, his fears were gradually forgotten and new memories were created.Maybe he could come back alive.Hope gradually bloomed in Jason. So, when Jason saw the truth, he couldn\u2019t help but despair even more.The dragon he was finally faced with was bigger than anything Jason had ever encountered. He could never win. He couldn\u2019t win.Today he will die.However, although Jason resented those who drove him to this place, he did not back down. Because today, he might die if he runs away.As Jason gripped his sword, the dragon\u2019s voice broke through his mind.\u2013 Even though it must have been a fleeting time for me, the time I waited for you was too long.\u2013 Did you know I was coming?\u2013 I\u2026\u2026 lived too long. Even though my soul was worn out and could no longer contain anything, this supreme body kept me living a life that was inferior to a corpse.The dragon quietly told the truth.\u2013 It was I, not God, who made the prophecy. / controlled the priest. Because dragons are a race that cannot commit suicide\u2026\u2026 I brought you here so that could die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What about his life?How many years did he lose? Who will make it up to him?He had endured to save the world. He endured it because he believed he had to save everyone.But only after preparing for his death did he realize that he was nothing more than a puppet. He was only used as an expendable item to help the dragon commit suicide. All that time, all the pain\u2026\u2026.\u2013 What about me? How are you going to compensateme?\u2013 You will be the strongest man in the world.\u2013 I didn\u2019t want to be one!Jason screamed. He ruffled his hair, then lifted his head and stared at the dragon. Tears ran down his chin like rain.\u2013 I didn\u2019t want to be\u2026\u2026 Rather, ask for forgiveness from me. Say sorry, even if it\u2019s empty words\u2026\u2026 Say something empty. What the hell am I for\u2026\u2026 Like this\u2026.. Like this\u2026..!\u2013 Nothing changed. If it wasn\u2019t for me, you would have killed a dragon someday. Because that\u2019s your destiny. Your \u2018necessity\u2019 in this world was just that.Many moments that he had to give up to get here passed by. He was angry because it was all in vain.However, even to Jason\u2019s scream, the dragon only responded heartlessly without any apology.\u2013 Finish your work.The dragon shut its mouth one last time. What he saw was not the body of a living dragon. It was close to the dragon\u2019s body, an illusion created by the fear of the dragon, so it had already disappeared without a trace when he came to his senses.Jason bent his back for a moment and laughed, then screamed. When he finally pierced the dragon\u2019s heart, the axis shook.He got a life. But was that the life he wanted? Jason ripped his heart out in vain.He was born to kill dragons? That\u2019s all this world, needs from him? So after killing the dragon, how was he supposed to live now?The boy, who had been raised as a tool to kill dragong all his life, has not grown a single inch emotionallySo Jason\u2019s thinking went to the extreme, ending (suicide in that no one would need him now that he had killed the dragon.The world survived on his sacrifice, and Jason was slowly falling apart.Day after day, when he couldn\u2019t find a reason to live and crouched in the field and blinked his eyes blankly, Jason remembered Helena. When even he didn\u2019t believe in himself, she was the only person who held his hand.\u2013 Trust your efforts. You worked harder than anyone. So it should be clear.He had to live. He thought he had to come back alive. It reminded him of the promise he had made to himself that he would live for her if he returned alive,That raised Jason\u2019s body up.Helena will need him. By Helena\u2019s side, who needs him, he will finally be able to put down roots. (PR/N: \u2018put down roots\u2019 as in \u2018settling down.)The way back was not difficult. On the road he ran into the people he had helped, but everyone was hesitant and passed by Jason. Seeing this, Jason confirmed once again that the dragon had intervened.He has been away from home for three years. It was not much time for rivers and mountains to change, but there was time for young children to grow up.How did everyone change? Are his parents okay? Little Faena, Helena, Alecto\u2026\u2026 Even if he tried to recall them, it was overflowing with blurry faces. If he were to do that, he would feel a little less lonely.As soon as Jason returned, he headed to the Imperial Palace. He also had to report to His Majesty the Emperor, but it was because Helena was there,After completing the formal report, he grabbed the attendants around him and asked where Helena was. He was informed that she was in the tea room near the garden.As soon as he opened the door, he saw two people, who had grown up, but were not so different from what he had imagined.A strange feeling swelled up in his chest. It was a relief that they didn\u2019t change. If the two were unfamiliar, Jason would not have been able to bear it. Jason jumped up and hugged the two of them.\u201cAre you drinking alone without me?\u201d\u201cJason! Are you back already?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to stay in the capital for a while. Isn\u2019t it a dazzling afternoon, Your Highness?\u201dWhile greeting each other, Jason suddenly noticed an unfamiliar woman sitting in front of him.Her ebony hair and fresh eyes were beautiful.Only after blinking his eyes a few times did Jason realize that the woman was Eris Mis\u00e9rian, Alecto\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201cOh my. I was disrespectful, Lady Mis\u00e9rian. You\u2019re still beautiful.\u201dHe acted more sly because he didn\u2019t want to be found out that he didn\u2019t recognize her, but Eris didn\u2019t seem to care. No, more precisely, she seemed uninterested in everything.She looked at Jason for a second with her dead eyes as if saying that it was endlessly boring.\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Lord Kazar.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t contributed to the Duke of Kazar, so that title is too much for me. I always say Jason is enough, but be formal.\u201d\u201cAs the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, how dare 1.\u201dIt was a small voice, but it was full of poison. Something was strange. Was Lady Mis\u00e9rian originally like this?Jason glanced at Alecto, but Alecto just wrinkled his face as usual. Eris said calmly.\u201cThere are many eyes looking, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to consider other people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\u201cThere is only one person under the sky who can do that\u2026. and he also cares about the comfort of silence.\u201d\u201cEris!\u201dHelena called out her name in surprise. Alecto clenched his fists, trying to contain his anger. Even though Alecto\u2019s fists were clenched, Eris did not blink an eye, and then slowly got up from her seat. She said, to Helena with a subtle smile.\u201cThank you for the tea, Lady Antebellum. But in crowded places, you shouldn\u2019t speak informally to His Majesty and I. There are things like status and one\u2019s gaze.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dHelena hugged Alecto, who was almost ready to run to Lady Mis\u00e9rian, and stopped him. Helena lowered her head in a timid manner and nodded.At Helena\u2019s expression, Jason suddenly showed hostility towards Eris, but he held it in.If he took Helena\u2019s side without justification, he risked making it even more difficult for Helena.Eris smiled as if she was satisfied with his answer and left without any regrets. Her appearance was very unfamiliar. The Eris Mis\u00e9rian that he knew, was a child who could not be prideful in front of Alecto. But now, Eris turned her back to Alecto before anyone else.A person who he\u2019d never thought would change, has changed. No wonder her back drew Jason\u2019s attention. Why did she change? What\u2026\u2026 made Eris Mis\u00e9rian have such dark eyes? He became curious.When he saw Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s carriage, Jason impulsively got on the carriage, and became obsessed with the idea of talking to Eris.As he waited for her in her carriage, the corners of his mouth went up in response to the reaction she would have.Will she hate it like she did when she was a child? He didn\u2019t think so, but she might be happy to see him. Last time he couldn\u2019t say hello properly\u2026However, what Jason was faced with was the appearance of her small cheeks swollen and red.Jason\u2019s face hardened. There were only a few people in this imperial palace who would slap this child.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. Lord Kazar has nothing to do with it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do as you say, Lady.\u201dAs Eris shrugged, Jason pretended to step back. Killing the dragon and coming back was a bit imprudent and shameless, and it was also a way to get someone\u2019s favor.He was constantly smiling and talking.Eris avoided his gaze with her tired face.\u201cAren\u2019t you going on your next adventure?\u201d\u201cI doubt it, even if I wanted to, since I killed the dragon, the mother of nature, I\u2019m thinking of spending some time in the capital city for a while, There are dragons who hate me.\u201dOccasionally I have nightmares of dragons coming.They killed his people and turned the world into a sea of fire, it was a dream where people blamed themselves.After that dream, he would instinctively check out the window. He wondered if people really didn\u2019t die lastnight, or maybe he couldn\u2019t stop them because he couldn\u2019t wake up.\u201cI have some time before I get to the Marquis, so tell me a little bit more about that story.\u201dEris made eye contact for the first time. Jason was a little startled and looked into her blue eyes. Pretty, but\u2026\u2026. It wasn\u2019t as lively as before.Originally, he was more mature than his peers, but now she felt more mature. Hearing his story, he glanced at Eris who was thinking hard and asked.\u201cI guess\u2026 you don\u2019t speak informally.\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re not that close. It\u2019s not something you can ask for.\u201d\u2013 Why do I have to treat you with respect? There are only three people under the sky whom I will respect.The lady, who proudly raised her head and spoke, no longer existed. Only the lady\u2019, who acts thoroughly based on calculation, remains.She\u2019s changed. Jason bitterly clicked his tongue inside and spoke to Eris as if he was making excuses instead,\u201cDon\u2019t blame those children too much. Since they\u2019ve only been in the Imperial Palace, they haven\u2019t met with anyone else of their age, so they\u2019re a bit clumsy.\u201d\u201cThey are past the age of receiving forgiveness for being clumsy.\u201d\u2013 Even if you\u2019re the Duke of Kazar, it\u2019s the same, Jason.One day, the comfort of \u2018Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019, who greeted him with courtesy passed.While meeting the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian and delivering his words, he kept thinking of Eris. It felt as if he were looking at himself. That aspect of pushing others away without taking root.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s why he went to see Helena often on purpose. He was relieved to face that fair smile. Helena nodded, listening to his story without any signs of displeasure.As expected, Helena was good. With Helena, he didn\u2019t think he would have nightmares anymore.Soon, there was a ceremony to appoint a knight. Jason decided to keep the promise he made to himself that day. He will make an oath that he can only do once forher.\u201cI want to make a knightly oath to you.\u201dOn the day of the inauguration ceremony, despite knowing that Eris was listening in the garden, he purposely did not stop.Even when she was young, Eris used to secretly bully Helena. He had condoned it in the past, but now that he has decided to protect Helena, he couldn\u2019t give her any more slack.\u201cJason, you can only take the knight\u2019s oath once! Why would you do that for me\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only once, so I want to do it for you, Helena.\u201dMaybe it would be okay to get married. Life in the imperial palace was hard. It would be much less difficult to live as a duchess than to live as a maid. While thinking of children resembling Helena running in the garden, a smile was drawn on the side of his mouth.Helena needed him.Jason knelt on one knee. He pulled out the sword from his waist and handed it to Helena and whispered.\u201c\u2026., Jason Kazar, pledge allegiance and obedience to Helena Antebellum in front of God. Even if the path is a series of hardships and adversity, I am willing to follow it, and no temptation will subside me.\u201d\u201cJason\u2026\u201d\u201cHelena, even if I can\u2019t walk the same path as you, I want to protect you to the end. Please allow me to do that.\u201dHer thin hands were hesitant. They slowly came up to his head. The number of spectators increased by one more, but he didn\u2019t care. Alecto was always one step behind because he had a lot of fears. He will run away as always.Everything went just as Jason expected.Except for one person.\u201cThen stab me now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you holding a sword? You can stab me with that.\u201dEris Mis\u00e9rian looked straight at Jason. Jason was overwhelmed by those eyes. Hesitating, Jason retreated.Eris did not stop and jumped towards Jason\u2019s arms.No. Jason instinctively dropped the sword and held Eris\u2019 wrists to defend himself.It wasn\u2019t the attitude of a fearful person. Eris pushed her face closer to Jason\u2019s with a fierce look.\u201c\u2026.When warning someone in front of you. Be prepared to stab the opponent to death right away.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you?\u201dEris Mis\u00e9rian was not a girl like this. It could not have been Eris Mis\u00e9rian who thought and acted like this. However, Eris turned around laughing at the suspicious Jason.\u201cSir Kazar, you weren\u2019t interested in me. That\u2019s an interesting question.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t deny it. Jason almost forgot about Eris. They played together when they were young, but they only said hello and never even talked properly. For him, Eris Mis\u00e9rian was close to the background. The background when meeting Alecto and Helena all the time.Inside him, a girl named Eris broke into pieces. Jason tried to redefine the figure, but it was somehow impossible.He didn\u2019t know Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Even if he tried to imagine it, it kept being blurred. A blurred existence, above all else, it had to do with Jason\u2019s fear. Jason resented the world for turning perfectly even in his absence.Somehow sad and distressed, Jason clenched his empty fist for a long time even after Eris left.It was from that time that he chased Eris Mis\u00e9rian. The world was harsh on Eris Mis\u00e9rian.Swordmaster Jason was able to hear the gossip about Eris more than anyone else.Even the smallest things that Jason had never thought about were criticized.Only then could Jason understand why the Eris from his childhood was so hung up on perfection. There were many who said she was at fault even when it wasn\u2019t her fault.Nevertheless, Eris did not complain.No, actually, she had never complained before.She always raised her head upright and expressed contempt rather than sadness. Now he knew that being mean to someone was her defense mechanism,And that even the last defense mechanism was an exception to Alecto. Even if it made her sick, Eris valued her \u201cexception.\u201dFinally, when Eris fell off the cliff, Jason realized that his curiosity should not end with \u201ccuriosity.\u201dThe thin body fell helplessly. Jason fell along with Eris without time to think.However, let alone being grateful even though he saved her, Eris was busy pushing him away somehow.Eris who had never cared about herself, Eris who said it didn\u2019t matter if there were many enemies, and Eris who said it was okay to die because she didn\u2019t feel sorry for her life.What happened to her while he wasn\u2019t there? Even if she hurt others, a girl who didn\u2019t destroy herself doesn\u2019t have any regrets about anything anymore. She speaks precariously, acts precariously, and lives as if to die.Jason couldn\u2019t understand Eris because he had always longed for life. He didn\u2019t even know how to deal with it because he couldn\u2019t understand it.His mistakes have come to an irreversible point. It seemed to get worse the more he tried to deal with it, so Jason ran away from someone for the first time,\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s criticism and punishment will be sweetened again by returning to the capital, so don\u2019t be too angry. Take Lady Mis\u00e9rian there.\u201dAfter letting an angry Eris go, Jason turned to something easier. Something that did not need to be treated preciously or require a single conversation. If you kill, that\u2019s all\u2026.Among the corpses, Jason stood alone and finally decided to try. He was always confident in his efforts and perseverance.Let\u2019s keep knocking on Eris. If he nudged her, she might think it would be a pity to die someday.There was a time when he dared to think like that.Jason Kazar was kind to Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Everyone will say that that statement was true.However, human relationships are different from any equation or machine, kindness doesn\u2019t produce unconditional favors. Furthermore, some relationships are never restored by individual efforts alone. Jason, unfortunately, realised this too late.Eris, who came to the mansion for his sister\u2019s debutante ball, was dressed differently from usual. She looked exactly her age. Only after seeing that did, Jason realise that Eris was younger than him.The Eris he remembered was always more mature, than his age or him. She was cold-hearted, quickwitted, vicious\u2026.. he assumed it was true because everyone said so. Usually facts are made that way.Perhaps what everyone was looking at was the colorful shell of Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Inside, a delicate girl was struggling.Now, in front of his eyes, the hard shell of Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019 was peeling off.Jason didn\u2019t make her that way. Because she was talking about Alecto, the only person who could break her down.\u201cI realized that kindness cannot be called love..\u201dJason tried to be kind.\u201cOnce upon a time, I thought that if I continued to love him, His Highness would look at me. That was the reason why I was so hung up on the Crown Princess seat. I needed a position from where I could be seen when His Highness looked back at me. It was a placewhere I could be rest assured and wait for His Highness with confidence.\u201dJason needed a place to rest.\u201c\u2026I have grown up. Since I realized that His Highness will never love me in my life, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to rest a little now?\u201dJason did not grow up.\u201cIt was my lifelong goal to become the Crown Princess and to be loved. It may sound funny to others, but it was as important to me as Lord Kazar\u2019s prophecy, After giving up on things like that, what regrets would I have?\u201dEris had acted as if loving someone was the value of her existence.She loved Alecto and would have liked to marry him and she believed that becoming the empress was the only ending to her life. Why did she like Alecto so much? Jason wanted to ask.It was only after Jason watched Eris that he was able to look back on himself from the past, who believed that killing the dragon was all he had to do. The way he had been living so far was not living.It was only a certain amount of time when he reluctantly held his breath because of responsibility,Did Eris not know how to do that? If she knew how, she would think she didn\u2019t want to die.Both Eris and him were drifting apart because they couldn\u2019t find their purpose. If each makes up for the other\u2019s shortcomings\u2026..Maybe we need each other. The idea was almost confirmed when Alecto said he was taking Helena as a partner to his sister\u2019s debutante prom.\u201c\u2026So, I\u2019m going to take Helena to your sister\u2019s debutante ball.\u201dAfter saying those words, Alecto seemed to pay attention to Jason for a moment. But Jason was obsessed with other thoughts.There was no way Eris would give up in the Kazar family\u2019s debutante ball. If she couldn\u2019t become a princess, her next best choice would be him. Even at her coming-of-age ceremony, she held out her hand, to him.Are you okay? Jason did not realize why Alecto had asked him such a question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 61Ghosts of FailureJason Kazar was so sure. Eris Mis\u00e9rian would hold his hand.The idea of being rejected did not exist from the beginning.\u201cSorry Lord Kazar, I\u2019m going to take my knight as my partner.\u201dSo when Eris refused, Jason had no choice but to be surprised. At first he thought she was going to say no once because of her dignity.But he paused at the part where she said, \u2018I\u2019m going to take the knight as my partner\u2019. Jason glanced at Anakin and spoke in a soft voice.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s on the same level as you. Wasn\u2019t that why you chose me at the coming-of-age ceremony? If you walk in with that knight, wouldn\u2019t everyone at the debutante ball laugh at you saying you\u2019ve been abandoned? Can you handle those gazes? Oh, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026.. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201dAlecto had abandoned her, so now Eris had no one but him. All she had to do was bend her ego a little bit. If you get the first button wrong, you just undo it all and start over.\u201cBut I\u2019m not going with you.\u201dWhy was she so stubborn? He told her he wouldn\u2019t love her anymore.\u201cI\u2019m not going with you.\u201dIt was confusing. Jason chose his words for a long time and managed to open his mouth. This was not the time to build up pride, lord\u2019s daughter.Perhaps it was Jason himself who wanted to build his pride. When Jason raised his voice, Eris cut him off.\u201cI hate you. No matter what people say, going anywhere with you as a partner is even more annoying.\u201dIt was cruel and cold. A sharp word followed and stabbed him in the lungs. Is this what it feels like to lose your heart? Jason clenched his fists so as to not stumble.He couldn\u2019t understand. The words he said were not so bad compared to Alecto\u2019s. He also apologized, unlike Alecto.He never knew that he would be hated for the rest of his life, for he had only shown hostility once. If only he could prove it, he wanted to prove it. It was a momentary mistake, so he tried to beg for a chance to make up for it.Eris sighed as if she was tired, and pressed the corners of her eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t know why Lord Kazar is so persistent withme.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one who wants to know why Lady Mis\u00e9rian., refuses favors. When it\u2019s hard\u2026 is it that hard to say it\u2019s hard?\u201dI wanted you to rely on me. I always thought, How nice it would be if a blind person like her looked at me.But Jason was a \u2018stranger\u2019 who did his duty by killing the dragon and was no longer needed. He was lonely, Jason was just lonely.\u201cTo be honest\u2026 Lady Mis\u00e9rian was only weak against His Highness. You have always been like that. Acting as if you didn\u2019t need anyone other than His Highness, and trying to pretend to be strong.\u201dJason strode over to Eris with bloodshot eyes and grabbed both of her wrists.Eris twisted for a moment, but that was all. Jason continued to speak as if pressured. He might cry violently if he stopped talking even for a moment.\u201cNow, even though you said that you want to rest a little\u2026 why\u2026 so\u2026 why are you beating yourself up?\u201dIn fact, it was what he wanted to hear.You don\u2019t have to push yourself anymore.It\u2019s okay if you stop. Surely someone will know. I\u2019m with you.As a young man who could not do anything despite being forced to do something unreasonable, Jason, who had to try to die to meet people\u2019s expectations, desperately needed clich\u00e9d support, even if it was empty words.She would have done the same. He was sure she wanted someone to know. She would have needed someone to understand and support her. He was confident now. He just needed to know her and protect her. Then both could be happy.However, Eris rejected Jason.She slapped him on the cheek and he stared blankly at Eris.\u201cWhat the hell do you know about me\u2026! Don\u2019t treat me like a weak woman you have to protect! You really don\u2019t know? I\u2019m not miserable at all! It\u2019s you who wants me to be miserable! That\u2019s how you can dig into that gap.\u201dHe was sure she was saying bad things because she was caught. No matter how ferocious she was, she would surely cry inside.\u201cYou know\u2026 I\u2019m not interested in Lord Kazar. Tdon\u2019t hate you either. Hating is possible only when you are interested.\u201dThat can\u2019t be true. He and Eris were of the same kind. Somehow, however, Jason faltered and backed down as Eris approached.When he looked down at Eris with a frightened face as if he were facing something he was afraid of, she quietly wedged.\u201cI\u2019m not curious at all. How you have lived and what you think.\u201dEven though he was crying, Eris did not show any sympathy. Jason eventually reached out, but Eris angrily struck out the hand.\u201cWhat makes you happy and sad\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t want to know, and I want to forget even if I know. I won\u2019t cry even if you go somewhere and die tomorrow. Because you\u2019re a \u2018stranger\u2019 to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t need me?\u201d\u201cIf you understand, don\u2019t talk to me from now on. I\u2019m tired.\u201dJason could not let Eris go like this. Somehow, if he sent her now, it seemed like it would forever end like this. Hang on. Please. Lord\u2019s daughter! Jason desperately called her, but Eris ignored him and walked firmly.As soon as he tried to grab her wrist, a fair hand, suddenly stopped him.A blurred face. It was the knight of Eris.After shaking his wrist off with strength, he let go of his hand. As a result, Jason, who was shaken by the rebound, stared fiercely at Anakin.\u201cHow dare you touch a noble\u2019s body?\u2026. Do you want to die?\u201d\u201cNot only is my master not Lord Kazar\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s my duty to stop whoever touches my master if she doesn\u2019t want to.\u201dAnakin, who responded rudely to Jason\u2019s threat, knelt down on one knee and looked up at Eris. Even looking down was rude. Like a believer.When Anakin asked for Jason\u2019s disposal, Eris sighed. Then, she laughed.That appearance was embedded clearly. It was a smile that she had never given him.He didn\u2019t know she could laugh at anyone other than Alecto.If he hadn\u2019t threatened Eris at first, would she have smiled like that if he had recognised Eris from the beginning?\u201cJason Kazar, don\u2019t bother me and leave.\u201d\u201cIf you want to throw away your emotions or memories like trash, I\u2019ll lend you a mirror. Take care of it by yourself. Don\u2019t look for someone else.\u201dIt was a useless assumption. Although Eris was concerned about Helena, she didn\u2019t even give him the slightest bit of compassion.Jason, who had been hurt by Eris and tattered, moved slowly guided by her maidservant. His mind went blank.\u201cIf I had known this, it would have been better if I had killed the dragon and died.\u201dNo, he would have been happier if he hadn\u2019t killed the dragon and it burned everything.Jason suddenly looked at his feet and swallowed a scream. His own shadow took the form of a dragon He tried to run away from the shadow, but the dragon\u2019s shadow clung to him and chased him without failure.My hands were shaking and I was terrified, but somehow I didn\u2019t regret it. Think. Let\u2019s think about it. I can\u2019t just be out of it since I did something. It had to be solved before this bell was over.What Medea said when Anakin and I went to her house one day came to mind.\u2013 Witches are a species that \u2018evolve\u2019 when they feel desperate. However, the grudge must be strong enough to break through all the truths that bind you.We talked a lot that day.Medea talked like Scheherazade [1] in \u2018One Thousand and One Nights\u2019, then looked at me silently and said, There\u2019s no way the bell will ring someday, but if you hear the bell, you must call out with confidence,\u2013 Why?\u2013 It\u2019s a precursor to the transition. We call it the sound of the bells of transcendence. When the bell rings, you evolve into a witch. And once you become a witch, you can\u2019t go back.Medea looked in the air for a while and added to me,\u2013 When you become a witch, you cannot cross the worlds and you\u2019ll be stuck in that world. This is because if a person with powers like a witch goes to another world, the existence of that world is in danger. You don\u2019t want to live in this world \u2018forever\u2019, do you?\u2013 \u2026\u2026 What should I do if I hear the bell?\u2013 Call the other witches to stop the bell. At least three people are required. It will be possible because you will be an existence that has not yet become a \u2018witch\u2019. Witches may know a little more about their field of interest, but there is basically no difference in power That\u2019s why when we kill another witch, we outnumber her.Ding. The fourth bell rang already.I was in a hurry. I called the name of the person needed the most right now. The name that I wanted to call so much.\u201cAnakin, I need you. Right now.\u201dHowever, the sixth bell rang and until then Anakin did not appear. Why?He can\u2019t have gone back. Because he can\u2019t leave his owner behind. Why isn\u2019t he showing up?I went around and around in the room and bit my finger. What if Anakin got caught up in something? felt like my head was going to explode with anxiety.Then, there was a rattling sound from far away Anakin was pulling himself up through the window had opened earlier.Just like how I imagined when I was sick in the mansion one day. As soon as he crossed the window, he ran to me and knelt down.[1] Major female character and the storyteller in the frame narrative of the Middle Eastern collection of tales known as the One Thousand and One Nights.

The knight led me to a distant place and I was waiting there. I came out because I was nervous and the door was locked, so I was late coming back.\u201dAfter he had finished speaking, he looked at my hands, wrapped them in his own hands, and pulled out a fragment of the vase from my hand.Blood was dripping from the wound caused by the sharp piece of the vase which had been pressed against my hand. I didn\u2019t realise, but I think I was still holding it. He pulled out his handkerchief and wrapped it tightly around my hand to stop the bleeding.I watched silently and opened my mouth. Ding. The seventh bell rang.\u201cNear the Empress\u2019s Palace\u2026 there is a big mirror, need you to bring it, is there anyone out there?\u201d\u201cThere is not.\u201d\u201cThen bring the mirror without being noticed by anyone. If it seems impossible to move the mirror, any other mirror is fine. Bring it as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dBy the time the ninth bell rang, Anakin returned with a large mirror. I stood in front of the mirror that he firmly held.\u201cMedea, the bell is ringing. Help me.\u201d\u201cAh, in the end.\u201dGive me your hand. Medea said so and reached out to me. I stretched out my hand as if possessed, and caught her hand through the mirror.I grabbed the witch\u2019s hand tightly and pulled her out of her mirror. She slipped out of the mirror and adjusted her dress.\u201cI don\u2019t have time, so I\u2019ll skip the greeting.\u201dMedea, who glanced down at the dead crown prince on the bed, drew two circles on the floor with her fingernails. And when she tapped the floor inside the circle, the circle burned with light. Two women appeared in the blazing light.Both had lustrous black hair, the woman with smooth dark brown skin had bright and vivid eyes, a high nose and plump lips. The other woman had ivory-colored skin with long, fierce eyes and a slightly raised slim chin.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Medea?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.A stranger?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. I think there are only a few Bells of Transcendence left. How many times has it rung so far?\u201d\u201cI just heard the eleventh bell.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only two left.\u201dMedea shrugged her eyebrows once and took a bell out of her arms. It was the bronze bell that I was going to touch at the store. She squeezed it to me and pushed me between them. The other three witches held each other\u2019s hands and circled around me.\u201cI\u2019ll say the spell, so make sure to ring the bell.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThey started chanting a spell, it was a kind of language that I couldn\u2019t understand. But as I was getting closer to becoming a witch, I unconsciously noticed that it was the \u2018witch\u2019s language\u2019.The bronze bell did not make any sound even when it was shaken, but strangely, as time passed, a bell began to sound.It was not the sound of a distant bell, but as if this bronze bell was making a sound. And my body heated up like it was burning. It seemed to be engulfed in flames.Medea winked at me not to stop ringing the bell. I felt like I was getting burned, but I held it in and constantly shook the bell.When they finally let go of their hands, I dropped the bell on the floor. While I blew on my hands, Medea smiled and picked up the bronze bell again. The sound of the bell stopped before I knew it.\u201cYou\u2019re the stranger Medea has been helping these days.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Nice to meet you\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHello. These are my sisters, Isis and Mirang\u2026 I didn\u2019t know Mirang would come.\u201dWhile greeting Isis awkwardly, a woman called Mirang blinked and said.\u201cCirce is busy playing with her concubine, so if you were to call her, she would ask me to go instead.\u201d\u201cDid her lover change again? Ha, that\u2019s too bad.\u201dMedea wrinkled her nose and pointed with her chin at the crown prince in the back.\u201cI needed Circe and Isis to deal with that.\u201d\u201cReviving is my area of expertise\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s not so much that it makes him move, but rather, it\u2019s close to that.\u201d\u201cIt can move and speak, but it\u2019s actually still a corpse,Isis.\u201d\u201cHumans can move and speak.\u201dIsis grumbled, but Mirang talked casually.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like that method, why not just turn backtime?\u201d\u201cIs it possible\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s too much to turn the whole day around, half of it should be enough for the three of us.\u201d\u201cEven if we turn back the time for two people?\u201d\u201cThen half of that.\u201dIsis said, shrugging her shoulders. At her words, Medea sighed and muttered as she facepalmed,\u201cAh, I should have brought Circe\u2026\u201d\u201cYou asked Circe to find the sword, and she had a hard time, so please cut her some slack today.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve come here to help you, but are you ignoring Mirang\u2019s specialty right now because it isn\u2019t magic?\u201dIsis lightly pinched Medea\u2019s cheek. Mirang also ruffled Medea\u2019s hair with her smug face. Rather than being angry, it was like a teasing act on a little sister.I was going to hold it in because they were busy, but I couldn\u2019t. I raised my hand slightly and asked.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but what is one\u2019s specialty?\u201d\u201cAh, a specialty\u2026how should I say this? It\u2019s an area that a witch is interested in and understands more deeply than other witches.\u201dIsis added to Medea\u2019s explanation.\u201cIt\u2019s useless to argue with a witch about who is stronger. We\u2019ve all reached one extreme point, so there\u2019s nothing more to develop. We can\u2019t go up, so we decided to go down..\u201dAfter Isis beckoned a few times, a picture was dimly drawn on her hand with smoke. Several witches played on her hand.\u201cSome witches love death, so they began to study how to make it easier, more comfortable and less painful to die. Some witches studied the passage oftime and explored how to twist it, and some witches put all their energy into digging into the mind.\u201dMedea intervened at Isis\u2019 explanation and said.\u201cIsis loves time, Mirang loves power.\u201dMy guess was right. If Isis, Circe and Mirang have their respective specialties\u2019, then Mirang is probably talking about the \u2018nonexistence of power\u2019.(T/N: \u201cnonexistence of power\u201d means the power that shouldn\u2019t \u201cexist\u201d, forbidden power)\u201cThen what about you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 What could it be? I\u2019ll let you know when I have time later. I don\u2019t want to waste my strength doing things that can\u2019t be helped, so stop coming in here now, both of you.\u201dMedea fixed her hair and avoided my answer again. She\u2019s always like this. When Medea called Anakin and me, Mirang looked at us with a cold gaze and asked.\u201cHow can you devote yourself to helping strangers who are nothing special?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Mirang. I found it thanks to them.\u201dAt Medea\u2019s words, Mirang opened her eyes wide and opened her mouth slightly.The same was true of Isis.\u201cDid you find it?\u201d\u201cI found it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then you\u2019re our savior.\u201dIsis looked at me for a while and bowed her knees slightly to greet me. Mirang also bowed her head with both hands together.What did you find? I looked at Medea because I was embarrassed, but Medea was just smiling.\u201cThat\u2019s it for the greeting\u2026\u2026. If you turn back time, you will be the only two who will not be affected by that time. All the other people\u2019 won\u2019t remember. Since it wasn\u2019t there in the first place.\u201dThis time, the three witches crossed their hands in an X-shape and grabbed us. It was a little cramped for Anakin and I to enter between the circles. Tick-tock. I heard the clock\u2019s second hand.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will really benefit you or not.\u201dI held Anakin\u2019s hand tightly. One side of my mind was anxious.\u201cI hope you make a satisfactory choice this time.\u201dWhen I woke up and opened my eyes, I was in the witch\u2019s shop. Obviously, I was clenching his hand, but Anakin was gone. Instead, Medea was the only one who smiled brightly. I blinked a little because it was not realistic. Did I succeed? I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201cYou are back to the time when I looked at your fortune.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Anakin?\u201d\u201cI called him. He\u2019ll be here soon.\u201dMedea gave me tea. Because my hands were still shaking.She asked me quietly.\u201cWhat are you going to do? I can\u2019t turn back time twice.\u201d\u201cFirst of all\u2026 I have to go to the academy with Anakin. There\u2019s a person who witnessed us there, and I think it\u2019s related to the person who suspects the Marquis as a criminal.\u201d\u201cThe Emperor will call you again. It\u2019s only the time of you both that went back, so the rest will try to repeat the same behavior.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of going to someone the Emperor can\u2019t move.\u201dThe Empress. As long as I am with the Empress, the Emperor will not be able to bring me out.I didn\u2019t mean to protect the Marquis.If the Marquis had his head cut off for treason, it was more beneficial for me. But my head, the traitor\u2019s daughter, would be cut by his side.However, depending on whether it was the Emperor, the Empress or the Crown Prince who wanted to kill the Marquis, there was a possibility that he could not die without luck.\u2013 Now I have to give it back. You did not marry me, but this Imperial family.\u2026.I remember what the Crown Prince said before he tried to touch me. Judging from the prince\u2019s expression and attitude, it seemed that the prince did not want to prevent the breakup of the marriage.The Empress decided that he could break up with me, so what was left was the Emperor. The Emperor trying to stop the breakup drove the Marquis to treason? There was no reason for that to happen.Then, either the empress or the crown prince charged the marquis with treason\u2026\u2026. If the empress was the culprit, it didn\u2019t matter that she betrayed me, but if it was the Crown Prince, I wouldn\u2019t die.The Emperor will save me. Because I\u2019m the Crown Princess from a noble family without a single maternal relative, there is no better woman to hold and shake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And if it has to happen, I would like for it to be the empress(PR/N: she\u2019d prefer to avoid the emperor and crown prince.)It was because if she betrayed me, I wanted to make a deal with her so I could have at least one weakness on her.Above all, I needed an excuse not to meet the crown prince tonight.I heard a knock on the door. Astonished, I watched the witch open the door.It was Anakin. That familiar face seemed somehow unfamiliar to me, so I stood blankly and looked at Anakin\u2019s face. Medea got up from her seat and looked at me worriedly, she said with only a blink of her eyes.\u201cWould you like to go take a little break?\u201dMedea, who looked at me worriedly, tried to smile,\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t hard. Over and over in my head, the previous situation was replayed over and over again. I had nothing to vomit, but I wanted to vomit. My empty stomach throbbed and my legs trembled.I had to pretend I was okay even if I wasn\u2019t okayBecause there was still work to be done. It\u2019s never too late to cry after everything is over. I hid it by squeezing my trembling hands tightly.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Anakin.\u201dEverything was repeated once again. But this time didn\u2019t dress up in a bright yellow colored coat. Last time, it was a date with Anakin, so I stopped by my house to change my clothes, and after the butler contacted the academy, I went off leisurely with Anakin.Now I didn\u2019t have time to relax like that. I have to start right away to catch the criminal one step ahead.When I got off the carriage, there were no people,from the academy this time. I came without saying a word, so it was understandable. I looked at the tightly closed iron door and ordered Anakin.\u201cCut it.\u201dIt was a crazy order, but Anakin never refused or complained. He pulled out his sword, looked at the door for a while, measured something, and soon cut down the thick iron door with a single stroke.The iron door fell back with a loud sound. People at the academy raised their heads one by one at the thundering sound. Soon after, two people ran thisway. They ran to us with a weapon, checked my face and lowered the weapon slightly.\u201cWhat the heck is this! How can you open the door to the sacred academy\u2026\u2026!\u201dSeeing those who did not hide their wary eyes, I raised my chin as arrogantly as possible and said annoyedly.\u201cClaim it to the Mis\u00e9rian family.\u201d\u201cMi, Mis\u00e9rian family\u2026\u2026.?\u201dThey looked through me for a moment and exchanged glances with each other. I gained momentum and retorted like a very rude person.\u201cI definitely sent someone to inform you that I was going to watch fireworks here\u2026\u2026 Why didn\u2019t he come out to greet me?\u201d\u201cExcuse me, Lady Mis\u00e9rian, we haven\u2019t been told anything.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m lying. Will you be able to handle it?\u201dThe student turned blue and shut his mouth. No matter how promising he was at the academy, he was just a commoner.If it was known that he had insulted the daughter of a great nobleman, he was more likely to be punished. Even if there was a supporter behind the brilliant child, even entering the academy would have become difficult.In fact, it was like abusing power, but I was in no situation to look after anyone now. I was sorry, but it was enough to charge the price of the iron door to theMis\u00e9rian house anyway. It didn\u2019t matter because wasn\u2019t the one who would pay.They whispered to each other for a moment to see if anyone knew it, and soon bowed their heads and said,\u201cThere must have been a mistake.\u201dThey quietly led the way, telling us to come this way. The students who were looking outside at the disturbance glanced at the two of us, but I didn\u2019t care,It was fortunate that Eris\u2019 personality was so overbearing and reckless. Even if I act so recklessly, may not be suspected.We arrived at an outdoor balcony overlooking the school\u2019s panoramic view. We sat side by side in a chair, but I didn\u2019t touch anything this time because I didn\u2019t have an appetite.Soon after, a group of people wearing thick capes came out and lifted something like a cane embedded with jewels. Then a flame was fired from the end of the jewel. Boom boom\u2026 Flames that shone brilliantly with the sound.But there was no more excitement. At this moment, remembered what I wanted to say to Anakin. Those sparkly emotions and beautiful times were all ruined.I felt like I was going to cry because it was unfair. Nothing has changed, but so much has changed.We were no longer impressed. I was just counting, trying to remember the time. The most perfect time to get out of here and catch the criminal\u2019s breath.Before the roar, Anakin held me in his arms to protect me from the explosion. People\u2019s screams resounded. This time, we both got up almost at the same time. I stepped out of the balcony and Anakin drew his sword and guarded my back.\u201cIt\u2019s a monster! A monster has appeared!\u201dA hole opened in the sky and winged monsters poured out. Close the gate! The gates closed and students rushed out of the building in unison. It was the same until the sound of the release of the heavy chains rang, and light burst out from the top of the spire in the center, blocking the academy.We had to figure out the location of the culprit who was watching us at the time. The person who stopped and stared at us as we ran when everyone was running away. Because I had a gut feeling that he might be the culprit.I looked outside, trying to figure out where we were that day. The monsters that had been destroyed by the students one by one began to merge into one. Then, they came together in a huge shape and melted the surrounding area quickly.\u201cEscape!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cHelp me!\u201d\u201cMove!\u201dPeople\u2019s screams broke out and confusion increased. The crowd was too large for Anakin to find him. remember it was near the stairs, but the academy structure was all similar, so I had no idea what kind of stairs they were.Let\u2019s think calmly, we have to think. I chewed on the bottom of my fingernails, closed my eyes and tried to concentrate. Anakin protected me from the crowds pushing me.And finally, I remembered that there was a flowering winter tree near the road we had escaped from\u201cThe red flower\u2026 Anakin, you need to find a place near the stairs where you can see the red flower tree. The culprit was standing there.\u201dWe ran through the chaos, trying to find the tree, Finally, next to the flower tree, we found the place where we were standing. We held our breath and waited for the culprit to arrive here.Finally, an ordinary man wrapped in robes walked towards the stairs. Anakin grabbed the man\u2019s neck in an instant.I slowly walked out in front of the struggling man. The man who saw me widened his eyes. I looked straight at the man and spoke with as much confidence as I could.\u201cGuide me to your master.\u201dI didn\u2019t even say who it was. If I chose the wrong one, it would be a failure.The struggling man squeezed his eyes shut.Anakin quickly pressed the man\u2019s jaw and opened his mouth to check. Anakin clicked his tongue once and put his finger inside and scraped something.\u201cIt is a poison for suicide.\u201d\u201cAs long as you accompany me there, I will be silent about everything\u2026\u2026. You did this because you hated the Marquis, right? Relax. The plan will go as scheduled.\u201dWhen we returned to the mansion, the culprit had already confessed. No matter how much he did as he was told, the empire could not have saved a felon who opened the pouring gate himself.\u2018If you hate the marquis enough to die for his death appeasement will work better than intimidationThe man took a few rough breaths. After a while he lowered his head as if he had resigned. As Anakin released the man\u2019s neck, he spoke to us with red bloodshot eyes.\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe man led us down to the basement of the academy. As we went around the winding road several times, there was a huge magic circle. So\u2026\u2026a \u201cmagic\u2019 force.\u201cThis\u2026 isn\u2019t magic engineering.\u201d\u201cMagic engineering cannot go against the rules. This is the magic circle left by a witch in the early days of the empire. It is connected to the underground of the Imperial Palace.\u201dThe man grabbed Anakin\u2019s sword with his bare hands and bled. As the blood soaked the floor, light poured from the magic circle.It felt like my body was leaning, and when I opened my eyes, I was sent to a completely different place. A sword was pointed at us in the dark, was there any other knight protecting the magic circle?\u201cWho are you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better lower the knife.\u201dThe light shone towards my face. The knights who confirmed my face drew their swords with surprised faces.\u201cHow come\u2026 You\u2019re here\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know that. You, keep guiding me. And Anakin\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt would be difficult if the emperor caught us coming here now. Anakin pulled out his sword without me saying anything. As I left the room where the magic circle was, I heard the screams of the knights behind me.As we climbed the stairs along the underground corridor, where we arrived was not the Empress\u2019s Palace. It was a little remote from the Imperial Palace and was not very large.There were no people, but everything was in order as if it was regularly maintained. It was rather fortunate. If this place looked like the Imperial Palace reception room, I would not have been able to endure it because I would have felt sick.I checked the location of Anakin standing near me over and over again. How long have I been waiting? Fortunately, the empress, not the crown prince, opened the door and came in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 64To Sell Your SoulI raised the corners of my mouth out of courtesy at the empress staring at me silently.\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d\u201cYou can ask questions first, Your Majesty.\u201dThis smile was enough. I lowered the corners of my mouth and spoke grimly to her.\u201cHowever, when Your Majesty\u2019s questions are over, you will have to answer me.\u201dThe empress sat across from me. She knocked on the table for a moment and asked me.\u201cHow did you find out about this place?\u201d\u201cA reliable guide took me there.\u201d\u201cI mean how did you meet the guide?\u201dShe spat it out in a low voice. I tilted my head slightly and recalled the face of a man who had already left to confess.\u201cI went to see the fireworks today and witnessed the gate opening in person. I was lucky and ran into the culprit who opened the door.\u201d\u201cLies.\u201d\u201cIf I had known at the time that the gate would open in the yard and I could die because of the monsters, of course I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the academy. I can see the fireworks from my house.\u201dThe empress shut up at my answer.She no longer made any excuses, didn\u2019t even try to back out.. She looked out the window silently and spoke quietly without even giving me a glance,\u201cSo, what are you going to do next? Did you intend to file a complaint against me for betraying you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d (PR/N: Eris being sarcastic.)I slowly leaned on the sofa. The empress\u2019s gaze turned to me. I closed my eyes slightly and opened them again at her. As is often the case when soothing cats,\u201cI can\u2019t throw away a card like Your Majesty very easily. First of all, you have to interrogate me today.\u201d\u201cAn interrogation?\u201dWondering, the empress asked back. I scrunch my nose playfully. Perhaps everyone in the academy knew that I was at the scene. Maybe everyone who came out as witnesses mentioned it once.\u201cI went in a bit loudly. Since the daughter was in the place where her father opened the gate, why not check if she\u2019s an accomplice?\u201dLast time, only a few people knew that I was at the academy because I told them in advance and went in quietly.There may be a few people who passed by and saw me, but that was enough to cover up that they\u2019ve seen it wrong. And maybe he was thinking of meeting me separately and conciliating with threats.I have to make it impossible to steal myself.So that there is no situation where it\u2019s just the crown prince and I are present.\u201cYour Majesty doesn\u2019t have to interrogate me directly. But please monitor if the interrogation really takes place.\u201d\u201cWhat do you gain from doing that? I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand me. It\u2019s enough if our interests match.\u201dAlthough we were not enemies, there was no need to hold hands with the empress. As long as we achieved our one goal of overthrowing the emperor and the marquis, we didn\u2019t need any other emotional elements. The empress was also convinced and nodded her head softly.\u201cIf you\u2019re done with the questions, it\u2019s my turn. Why did you do this? If you get caught, you won\u2019t be safe.\u201dThe scale of the empress\u2019s decorations was larger than expected. In the past, there had been a war of magic with the demon king, so one of the countries that was fed up with demons was the empire.The reason why the empire was a sacred state that followed the Pope with diplomatic relations came from the magic war. This was because, as well as defeating demons, the divine power made a great contribution to healing the land and people from being tainted by demons.Those who controlled demons were punished with death, and even if they came into contact with them, they were severely questioned. She even offered a bounty to encourage the extermination of demons at a national level.In this situation, If it was discovered that she had opened a portal where monsters poured into the capital, no matter how big the empress was, there was a high possibility that she would be dethroned as well as being held accountable and sentenced to death. It was reckless to exchange for the life of a single marquis.The empress snorted at my question. She raised her head and said casually.\u201cI hate the Marquis.\u201dOne day, when I told her that I hated her, the empress got mad at me. She honestly expressed her feelings in front of me, saying she wanted to kill me. But now the empress did not even do that. Even a single word of emotion only spoke a certain \u2018fact\u2019 in a subdued voice as if it were a luxury.\u201cAnd\u2026 I hate the Emperor who drew him in as much as I hate the Marquis.\u201dAfter the empress had finished saying that, she laughed for a moment. There was more madness than usual.\u201cI know better than anyone else how to make the emperor suffer. I\u2019ll kill myself.\u201d\u201cIf you know how, why don\u2019t you do it?\u201dThe empress folded her eyes and laughed as if she was looking at an innocent child. At the moment, she looked my age. Youth, which was just happy without any worries, was briefly overlaid on her face and melted away. And the empress calmly described the infinitely terrifying past.\u201cI tried. I hung my neck. I lost my mind for a day and when I woke up, it smelled strongly of blood\u2026\u2026 Hundreds of people\u2019s heads were cut off for failing to manage me. Even the children who have been helping me since I was a Crown Princess, all the children who just joined as apprentices were also beheaded.\u201dThe empress swallowed her saliva for a while with a painful expression. She stopped talking for a long time and barely opened her mouth. She looked calm again.\u201clowe my life to a hundred people, so I had to live even if I didn\u2019t want to. If I can\u2019t die or kill the Emperor, I will live to get revenge, I vowed.\u201dThe empress closed her eyes slowly and put her hands together to interlock her fingers.\u201cAfter that, I scratched up information and interfered with what the Marquis was doing. Starting with small things, I also destroyed the magic train he worked hard on. The Marquis will someday run that scrap metal again, but he won\u2019t be able to make money for a while anyway.\u201dIt was the empress who broke the magic train I rode. Thanks to her, I was basically a fish in troubled water because it further delayed Jason\u2019s pursuit of me. The Empress then said.(PR/N: 1 2/2/2/ is a fish in troubled water which comes from the idiom that a fisherman passing by in a fight between a long bill and a clam could hunt both in the middle of the fight. Basically, one person has an advantage due to two people fighting, you play a person off against another and you just benefit from it, in this cose Eris was struggling and the empress was benefiting.)\u201cIt\u2019s still not enough to open the gate and blame it on the Marquis. This is not enough to kill him.\u201d\u201cIs it not enough?\u201dFinally, the empress opened her eyes. All of a sudden, there was blood in her eyes. She may have been closer to a witch than me. But she could not transcend. If the empress became a witch, would her life be better?\u201cSince it\u2019s the Marquis that colluded with the Emperor, he may end up with his property confiscated, and driven out under the pretext of working for the country. That\u2019s not what I want. I have to see the Marquis vomit blood and die.\u201dIf it was the emperor, it was possible enough. No, the marquis did not really commit it in the first place, so it was enough to release him due to insufficient evidence.A definite sin was needed. The marquis actually committed\u2026\u2026 a definite sin. I listened to the empress and said.\u201cIs it enough to commit treason?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf the daughter makes her father commit a rebellion, will he be able to pay for it with death?\u201dShe looked at me like someone who saw a ghost. I looked back at Anakin standing behind me for a moment. Anakin shook his head silently. It meant that there were really only the three of us there. I spoke to the empress with confidence.\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not the only one who pays the price. Your Majesty must pay the same price as my father.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re going to take our lives at the same time?\u201d\u201cFour, me too. I know how serious it is to open the gate. If Your Majesty saves my father again this time, it is only in the name of killing the royal family.\u201dI blinked and hoped she would get caught. This was more like helping the empress, but it was not a bad situation for me either. The more crimes, the better.That way, I\u2019ll definitely be executed.The empress blinked for a moment when I said I would die and asked.\u201cWhy do you want to die?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a matter that Your Majesty doesn\u2019t need to understand. What\u2019s important now is whether or not Your Majesty will hold my hand.\u201dI shut up for a moment and added.\u201cIf you kill His Majesty and even kill my father for killing His Majesty, isn\u2019t that equivalent to killing two rabbits at once?\u201d (T/N: 4+1 people-Eris, Empress, Emperor and Marquis + Heleno)She seemed to be thinking about something with her mouth closed for a moment. The empress asked.\u201cHow are you going to kill me?\u201dIn the original story, Eris killed Helena with a poisoned teacup. Perhaps the cup was brought to her by the marquis. I had to stab Helena with the dagger the witch gave me anyway, so I thought that giving the teacup to the empress wasn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201cI\u2019m going to ask my father to get a poisoned tea cup.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. To drink tea with the emperor in that?\u201d\u201cYou have to drink it together. That way, you can get out from the list of suspects. If it\u2019s found out that you are an accomplice, His Highness might have problems with legitimacy when he ascends.\u201d\u201cThe throne is\u201d\u201cOf course, His Highness will be there. There are only four people who die.\u201dI shrugged to the empress and added.\u201c\u2026\u2026Anyway, His Highness is still alive. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to minimize the possibility just in case?\u201dKilling the emperor and empress would be an adventure for me as well. It was unlikely, but it wouldhave been difficult for the crown prince to become emperor even if there was a coup.\u2026.Anyway, because I want to make Helena the empress. The child deserves a happy ending.The empress who was listening to me suddenly burst into laughter. But when I looked up, tears were pouring out of her eyes. It looked strangely beautiful.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sell my soul because no witch appeared to buy it.\u201dShe got up from her seat as it possessed and knelt at my feet. She smiled while touching my face with both hands. With eyes as if facing holy things.\u201cNow that I see you, I think I was here to meet you. You came to buy my soul.\u201dThe empress, who had been speaking sorrowfully, growled, clenching her fists on my lap.\u201c\u2026Give me that cup. If the Emperor doesn\u2019t drink, I\u2019ll, pour everything into his throat. Finally, after such a long time\u2026\u2026 I will avenge my son.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That I, who persuaded her to die, would rather be her savior.She\u2019s different from me. I\u2019m trying to die to live, but the empress is not afraid of death even though this is real life, she is not afraid of death even though she only has one life. What made her do that?The empress resembled \u2018Eris\u2019 in many ways. This was the case with having power since birth, beauty and heartlessness. However, for both the loved woman and the unloved woman, the ending was concluded as misfortune.Now I realize one common thing in the stories I\u2019ve been reading for fun. That a woman branded as bad in the world of stories cannot survive.Because she is not the main character, the stigma can never be erased because this world is not their story.But the main character can\u2019t be the only one in the story. She should have the right to live even if she is not the main character.I woke up once every two hours. It had nothing to do with my will. Perhaps the shock of the incident with the crown prince was so great, it was just\u2026\u2026 my body couldn\u2019t fall asleep.I would jump up and check the surroundings even if ! couldn\u2019t hear anything because I was nervous all over. I was tired and nervous because I couldn\u2019t sleep.It was already the third time I woke up.Eventually, I gave up sleeping and sat up.After the empress left, I was locked up in a tower-like place. Anyway, I guess I couldn\u2019t be imprisoned in a cellar because my status was still that of a semi-royal.Except that it was small, the bed was actually quite large and soft, and it was not particularly dirty, so it felt more like an inn than a prison. I looked out the window for a moment. Um, it\u2019s high.Even if it was Anakin, I don\u2019t think he could climb up here. I have a hand mirror that Anakin secretly handed me, so if I want, I can call the witch..I heard a rattling sound, and the maid brought me a meal. Even if I ate poison, I wouldn\u2019t die, but I had no appetite. I put only a few spoons of soup in my mouth and put the bowl down on the floor.It was great luck to have a clock in the room. Thanks to it, I didn\u2019t have to feel anxious about waiting for someone while not knowing how much time had passed..It was not until evening that the servant came back into my room. He tied a cloth to my eyes to cover them, then carefully held my hand and led mesomewhere. I didn\u2019t intend to run away, but the servant held me firmly with a strong grip.How far did I walk? I was guided to one room and placed in a chair. I could hear the door locking, and there was a strict-looking old man sitting on the other side of the table.I was thinking of saying hello first, but I just shut up because the person with the lower status usually says hello first.When I glanced sideways, I saw that standing next to me was a face that I had seen in the empress\u2019 palace,It was fortunate that the empress did what I said.There was no Anakin, so it was dangerous to be dragged around at will. The old man looked at the documents for a moment and then greeted me,\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired. If there\u2019s anything you want to ask, let\u2019s hurry up and ask it.\u201d\u201cOkay. You visited the academy yesterday.\u201dIt gives a hint of doubt, but not reassurance. I don\u2019t know what will happen if I keep being imprisoned in the Imperial Palace. Lies and truth usually sound more plausible when mixed. I answered with a calm face.\u201cBecause I wanted to see the fireworks.\u201d\u201cWhy in the academy? You\u2019ll be able to see them from the outside.\u201d\u201cI wanted to see them from a place where I could see them best. Why should I be listening to this silly question?\u201dWhen I got annoyed on purpose, the old man coughed several times. I turned my eyes away.\u201cDid you see the gate opening?\u201d\u201cI saw it. Is it a problem?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian who opened the gate, it\u2019s a problem.\u201dHe smiled and tilted his head in an awkward way. After cleaning under my nails for a while, thought I should know what they were trying to fit in, so I asked. (QC/N: as in, the story they want.)\u201cDo you mean that I helped my father open the gate? On what grounds?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t open it yourself, but by knowing the Marquis\u2019 plans, you may have assisted him\u2026\u201dAha, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to take me out of it, right?Certainly, aiding and abetting crime was not as punishable as treason. Especially when I said I didn\u2019t know. If I pretended not to know here, it was clear that they would pretend to investigate a little more, and soon remove me from prison and show condolences.\u2026..Or they might threaten me to behave if I don\u2019t want to be detained again. It\u2019s a dilemma. By being tied up as an accomplice with the marquis, there is still work to be done, and the crown prince will be caught when the charge is denied. If so, there is only one way I can do this.\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt means I\u2019m going to exercise my right to remain silent.\u201dThe old man\u2019s face gradually turned red at my shameless words. He yelled at me, hitting the desk hard.\u201cYoung lady! Opening the magic gate is a crime of treason! Don\u2019t you know how serious this incident is?\u201d\u201cI know. So tell His Majesty that. Lady Mis\u00e9rian didn\u2019t say a word, saying she was using her right to remain silent\u2026. and\u2026\u201dIt was like a naive robber\u2019s remarks, but it was calculated so that if I used the right to remain silent, the emperor would not be able to do anything else about me. You won\u2019t be able to torture me.Since I already had a connection with the Empress, thought I could give her a little hint if he was locking me up for too long.Anyway, one of the reasons I have to go out is to help her.The old man was trying to say something and noticed the servant behind me.\u201cIf there is nothing left to say, I want to go back now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The interrogation will continue.\u201dThe interrogation was concluded with a line like a third-rate villain\u2019s. The servant covered my eyes again and led me to the room.When I came back, I laid down on the bed as if collapsing.As I was left alone, endless helplessness surrounded me. How much longer do I have to endure? How far have I come in this novel?I rolled out my blanket and breathed silently. Breathing was also horribly overwhelming. I didn\u2019t want to do anything.After that, the interrogator called me over and over again, but I remained silent. At this rate, he threatened the death penalty and begged that he would release me immediately if I denied it, but it was all useless.I still woke up once every two hours, and I had no appetite, but I ate a little bit of rice. However, couldn\u2019t help being tired because I couldn\u2019t sleep.I was leaning against the corner of the room, just blinking my eyes, and suddenly a person came through the door.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201dWhen she pulled up the hood, it was Helena, and her white hair poured out. I was so surprised that I stared at her.She shouldn\u2019t have been here. If she gets involved, she could be kicked out, let alone become the crown princess. I\u2019m still being treated as a semi-royal because of the emperor, but it would be over for Helena, a low-ranking maid, who was hated by the emperor.\u201cWhere do you think you are coming!\u201d\u201cI was so worried about Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen I screamed, Helena shrank and took something out of her arms. It was meat, bread and cold fruits that remained vaguely warm. I was speechless when I saw the food she handed me.I\u2019m in prison, but I still had a luxurious meal. No, at least they will be more expensive than Helena\u2019s.But these foods that she brought for fear of me starving\u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t throw them away. As if to check, she watched as I finished eating.When I finally finished eating, I spoke quietly to her.\u201c\u2026I enjoyed the meal. But don\u2019t come here again, Because it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u201dThe moment Helena tried to say something more, heard footsteps. I gestured to Helena and sent her away. She looked back at me again and again and soon disappeared down the hallway.The servant appeared from the hallway on the other side just as Helena barely disappeared. The servant covered my eyes as always, and I followed him as I walked.But something was strange. No matter how blind they were, people had senses, so they had to roughlynotice which direction they were going. It was a different place from the usual room.When I tried to pull out my arm, the servant held me firmly. I twisted my body and told the servant.\u201cWhere are you taking me? The direction is different than usual.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to kidnap you, so please be relieved. However, you can\u2019t go to that room because of circumstances.\u201dYou have to be able to believe that. But while I was struggling, I was pushed into a room. The servant released my eye patch.It was definitely a different room than usual. The table and the chair made it more luxurious. It was like a room designed to answer to someone rather than interrogate them. The interrogator, who was waiting in the room first, poured the tea. He smiled kindly and told me.\u201cSit down, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cDid you give up on the interrogation?\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t make Lady Mis\u00e9rian open her mouth.\u201dHe shrugged once, quenched his mouth with tea, and looked towards the door.Somehow, my spine was cool. The fact that this room was so nice also played a part.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a place to treat people higher than me.\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t good enough, so I brought someone to persuade Lady Mis\u00e9rian instead of me.\u201dThe door opened. I really didn\u2019t want to look back. felt like I shouldn\u2019t look back.However, the interrogator smiled and bowed his head, and greeted the person behind me.\u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Your Highness. Thank you for coming.\u201dI was suffocating. Don\u2019t come. Don\u2019t come close to me. There was no Anakin here. Fragments of last night flew like sparks. I felt nauseous.However, contrary to my wishes, Alecto slowly approached me. Our eyes finally met.Repeating what happened that night\u2026\u2026 I never had such a nightmare. I had never slept that deeply before. Reality was always worse than nightmares.I was frozen to the core. I forgot how to breathe, I felt suffocated to death, so I had to breathe like I was bursting out.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, are you okay?\u201dThe interrogator felt something strange and tried to come up to me to check my complexion, but I hit his hand roughly.The sound of teeth gritting was clearly audible. Was it my voice that was seething, or was it anger? Probably both.I still remembered clearly. The sense of being dragged, the fear, and the touch of the vase in my hand.The sour taste that poured out when I was nauseous, terrible helplessness, and the sound of my heart that seemed to explode when I was nauseating\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m going crazy, but I\u2019m barely holding it in!\u201cYou\u2026.. How can you be so shameless?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian?\u201d\u201cGet out.\u201dMy pale hand was clenched on my lap. Maybe that\u2019s how tired my face was. I shouted as if I was squeezing my throat. It was almost a scream.\u201cCan\u2019t you hear me telling you to leave? Get out! Get out! Get out!\u201d\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, calm down.\u201d\u201cGet out before I kill you!\u201dWhy do you look surprised? I already succeeded once You don\u2019t think I\u2019ll succeed twice?\u201cHow dare you be rude to me?\u201dThe crown prince\u2019s surprised expression did not last long. He soon hardened his face as usual. While frowning in the middle of his forehead, he tried to catch me with an angry voice.I screamed. I shook my body recklessly and tried to shake him off. Something seemed to have been scratched to the point where my throat was hoarse,I had a headache and shortness of breath. I couldn\u2019t control it and twisted my trembling body. While lying on the floor, my eyelids shook, and I breathed in vain and coughed.My vision was blurred\u2026.. I could remotely hear voices of people looking for a doctor.When I came to my senses, I was on the bed. Seeing that it was not a bed in the prison tower, it seemed to be an ordinary imperial room.My head was pounding. I didn\u2019t even have the strength to get up, so I just closed my eyes, and soon after, someone came into the room. They seemed to be maids.They wiped off the cold sweat off my face for a while and soon lowered their voices and began to talk,\u201cShe still isn\u2019t up? They said she didn\u2019t get hurt anywhere.\u201d\u201cShh, you need to be extremely quiet.\u201dAt the scolding of another maid, the maid closed her mouth for a while, and soon lowered her voice and asked.\u201cIs that true? I heard Lady Mis\u00e9rian went crazy and ran around\u201d.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian used to be a little crazy. That\u2019s not a flaw in the Imperial Palace, sweetheart.\u201dThe other maid added frustratingly at the maid\u2019s gentle tone.\u201cNo matter how crazy Lady Mis\u00e9rian was, she only trembled at His Highness. This time, she pinched him, scratched him and made a fuss.\u201d\u201cOh, my. Really?\u201dThe maid, who had been surprised for a while, soon sighed once and spoke pitifully.\u201cThat\u2019s understandable. Because of her great pride, she was always despised by His Highness, and she was completely abandoned.\u201d\u201cDid she become completely abandoned?\u201d\u201cForget it. I shouldn\u2019t have said that about a sick person\u2026\u201dWhen the maid stopped talking, I heard another maid busily chasing her. The maid with a slightly higher voice spoke to another maid as if she was whining.\u201cHow can you stop talking? Making people curious\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t you know that the more you stay in the Imperial Palace, the more you have to spare your words?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll spare them. I\u2019ll totally spare them. So, huh? Let me know. Curiosity killed the cat.\u201dThe curious maid must have tickled the silent maid. I heard a laugh. The tickled maid sighed as if she couldn\u2019t win and brought it up.\u201cSigh\u2026 Do I have to keep it to myself? My cousin works for Duke Kazar. You may know that His Highness took Helena to Lady Kazar\u2019s debutante ball.\u201d\u201cOf course! For a while, all the maids in the palace were going crazy over that, right?\u201d\u201cBut she said Helena was wearing purple\u201d.After finishing her words, the maid continued to speak with a very low voice.\u201cWearing clothes in a color that only the royal family can wear means that she\u2019ll soon become the royal family.\u201d\u201cWhat? But Helena is not a noble.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s rotten, it\u2019s still a herring, the bloodline is still noble. Lady Mis\u00e9rian is also pitiful. The Marquis was also charged with treason, and now even he\u2019s going crazy\u2026 (PR/N: \u2018Even if it\u2019s rotten, it\u2019s still a herring\u2019 is a Korean folk saying that means that anything that\u2019s naturally good will never wear out or change. In this case, the maids are saying even if Eris is crazy, she\u2019s still a noble so all is still good.)It was not until the maids escaped and the door closed that I opened my eyes.First of all, the marquis was still captured.It didn\u2019t matter if the marquis died here, but he shouldn\u2019t die yet. Because I don\u2019t know where to get the cup the marquis had brought.If I ask the witch, I\u2019m not sure if she would do me a favor, and I don\u2019t know what she would ask for in return.No, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back even if I kill Helena as the witch told me to. What if the witch deceived me?Come to think of it, she was weird. Does she need to help me just because it\u2019s fun?She said she found something important, but I didn\u2019t find anything for her. Why did she lie like that to the other witches?Paranoia kept lingering in my mind. I was pulling my hair out and suddenly found the mirror Anakin gave me in my pocket. I touched the mirror, looked around, and took it out.\u201cMedea\u201d\u201cI want to ask you something.\u201dShe looked at me silently. Even if she lied to me again, or if I didn\u2019t believe her, at least I should ask.At least later, I could make excuses to myself, like\u2019 was honest. It\u2019s just that she wasn\u2019t honest.\u2019\u201cWhat did I find for you? Why did the witches greet me then?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your story, stranger. You\u2019re going to leave, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I need to know. Because I don\u2019t understand why you are helping me this much.\u201dMedea laughed, but she was staring coldly at me for the first time. The gaze hardened me.\u201cYou\u2019re very suspicious. You always think, calculate and think about whether your opponent is trying to hurt you. Poor thing. Aren\u2019t you tired of living like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just answer the questions | ask.\u201d\u201c\u2026You, you\u2019ve read this world before, right?\u201dI got goosebumps. I accidentally lost the mirror from my hand. The witch continued without caring about me.\u201cWhen the story is over\u2026\u2026 What do you think the world will be like?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWhen God\u2019s story is over\u2026\u2026. The world begins to collapse.\u201dI picked up the mirror again. Medea from the mirror closed her eyes with a hardened face. She took a breath and soon continued to talk\u201cThe end isn\u2019t coming right away\u2026\u2026 but it gradually loses power and starts to wear down. Chaotic beings that are neither life nor death begin to appear, and they begin to consume both life and death.\u201d\u201cThen what happens?\u201d\u201cLife is no longer born. Death disappears.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Isn\u2019t it done? It\u2019s maintaining the status quo.\u201dThe witch said with a smiling face.\u201cLet\u2019s say one person was stabbed. That person remains stabbed with a knife for the rest of his life\u2026\u2026. Blood keeps coming out, and he feels pain, but he can\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cIt must be\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s like a zombie. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a zombie, Medea rubbed her fingertips lightly.\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s maintaining its condition. All beings who are neither dead nor alive have their own selves\u2026\u2026. Being stuffed without doing anything.\u201d (PR/N:like comparing to stuffed animals.)Medea somehow had a sad face.\u201cYou know, witches can move. We\u2019re not creatures of God. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more painful. We\u2019re the only things that can move, but can\u2019t give rest to the world. Because we are not gods.\u201d\u201cSo? Is that the solution I found?\u201d\u201cWell, you can say that. We will create a new god in this world.\u201dMaking a god? This was an idea that struck my head like lightning for a moment..\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cShh. I said it wasn\u2019t about you, right?\u201dMedea had a scary expression. It was a more eerie face than any other face I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. My heart shrunk as if I was a prey in front of a beast. Medea soon raised the corners of her mouth and warned me.\u201cIsn\u2019t your wish to escape this place and return to your world? Please don\u2019t let me have any hostility towards you. Okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026..I will keep that in mind.\u201dWhen I swallowed my saliva and answered Medea, my face was reflected in the mirror again. My face? What was I thinking just now? My body trembled.No, this is not my face. But somehow, I couldn\u2019t remember what I originally looked like. No.There\u2019s no way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 67I\u2019m Not Eris\u201cNo!\u201dThe hand mirror was thrown into the wall and shattered.Hearing the scream, the maids ran into my room. They grabbed me and tied me to the bed, and soon pressed a syringe onto my arm. My consciousness became blurred. I think tears came out little by little. It was not me\u2026..Everyone calls me Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Even though I\u2019m not Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026.I didn\u2019t want to get up. I didn\u2019t even close the curtains, but it was dark. I guess it was night.I rubbed my eyes helplessly, and then rubbed my cheek against the Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s blanket, which I\u2019m used to now. The bedding of the Mis\u00e9rian family always had a subtle floral smell. My house always smelled like well-dried blankets.The pillow was wet. Was I crying? Was I crying again? There was no sense of reality to anything.If I\u2019m going to keep crying like this, I\u2019d rather cry and melt away.If I was made of salt, I would easily dissolve from the tears, but why did the gods make bones and flesh?A giggle came out. It\u2019s like looking for a God only in difficult situations, even when you don\u2019t believe in God.Is that why? I suddenly raised my head.If I believe in God even now, will God save me? Blessed are the ones who believe in it.\u201cAha, ahaha\u2026\u2026 hahaha!\u201dI turned my head and laughed. There was no God. If there is a God, you can\u2019t do this to me. You can\u2019t betray me like this, who worked so hard in a poor family.If you wanted to save me, you should have saved me earlier. I\u2019m the only one who can save me\u2026\u2026 I know better than anyone else.I darted out of bed like an arrow. I fell and rolled a few times because of my legs, but I didn\u2019t care. I grabbed the mirror in the corner of the room and carefully examined the reflection in it.Fumbling, I touched my face. The woman in the mirror followed and touched her face with her hands.\u201cThis can\u2019t be? Me, it\u2019s not me?\u201dThe woman laughed. I screamed as if I had seen a ghost. The mirror that left my hand broke and shards splattered here and there. I screamed and scratched my head.\u201cGive me my face, give me back my face!\u201dA hoarse sound squeezed out of my throat. This voice, was not mine either. This house was not mine either Even the people running now are not for me.The maid held me together. I resisted by waving my arms and legs. I felt resentful and sad. I was upset and sad.\u201cGive me my face back! No! No!\u201dJust then, Anakin ran in. I could see it very slowly and clearly. That\u2019s right. You, whom I love, weren\u2019t really mine either. You, too, were Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s knight.It felt so unfair that I was going to die. I can\u2019t believe had to leave you, whom I love, in this world.You are the only lovely thing in this world, but I can\u2019t even have that.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dIf I die in this world, I forever can\u2019t see you or even hold your traces in my hands. This was our last time.It was as absurd as it was cruel. So I once again denied God. It felt like my soul would be shattered if I didn\u2019t do this.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian is crazy.\u2019The whole capital talked about it. Some people said they saw me walking around at night.When I heard that, I checked my feet every time! woke up, but my feet were clean even though there was always a wound that someone wiped off.Whether it was to compensate for the sleepless nights, I habitually tried to sleep. Because when I opened my eyes, there were so many tiring things. I didn\u2019t even know I wanted to escape.The maids and Anakin diligently woke me up. They forced me to take a walk in the garden. Leaning on Anakin, I was half out of my mind and walked around like a ghost. The Marquis had yet to return.The imperial family sent someone to call me to the palace, but I continued to refuse under the pretext of being sick. It actually hurt. It was a psychological problem rather than physical.Normally, they would have tried to take me by force under the pretext of an imperial order, but the chief servant looked at my face and quietly returned with a sad expression.The doctor also came and went, but he couldn\u2019t particularly fix me. He just prescribed a stronger sedative.Even if I took sedatives, my heart kept beating. If couldn\u2019t sleep, I looked at the ceiling. I breathed lightly while looking at the invisible ceiling pattern.They said Helena came once. The maid said I was sleeping, so she didn\u2019t wake me up, but she just stayed with me.I knew she was nosy, but she was a very strange kid. You should study more with the time you come to meet me. Or go out and play.If she becomes the crown princess soon, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to do that.Even the marquis contacted me. He called me to attend the Imperial Palace to testify. Of course! ignored it.It wasn\u2019t just that there was the crown princeJust\u2026.. I didn\u2019t want to do anything. Is burnout syndrome like this? I woke up, ate and fell asleep again.Another week has passed since then. The empress sent someone to send me a letter. The message was that the marquis would be released soon, so be prepared.I put the letter in the fireplace and stared blankly as it burned. It\u2019s just\u2026 Overall, I was out of order. And didn\u2019t feel motivated to fix it. It was so comfortable because I didn\u2019t do anything.Come to think of it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever rested like this in Korea.Because I\u2019ve always been busy. I ran around during vacation to write even one more line on my resume After getting a job like that, I lived a busy life without spending my monthly leave properly. I used to live so hard.By the way, when the marquis is released, I won\u2019t be able to rest anymore. Oh, what should I do?I haven\u2019t been using my brain too much, so even if I tried to think a little, I heard a loud noise.Right now\u2026\u2026 when the marquis is released, I have to whisper to him to get a poisonous cup. Then I\u2019ll give it to the empress\u2026\u2026 I, I, I have to kill Helena\u2026\u2026 executed\u2026\u2026.Wait. Before that, I have to turn her into a crown Princess, but what should I do to do that? How much more do I have left?I felt nauseous. How much more do I have to squeeze out of myself? I pressed hard around my dark eyes. Let\u2019s hang in there a little longer. There\u2019s very little left.As expected, I should go to the imperial family now. I should show my appearance to the emperor and nail Helena to the position of the crown princess. If it\u2019s not now, there won\u2019t be any time.When I woke up after lying down for a long time, my head was pounding. Anakin caught me staggering.I leaned against Anakin, I called the maid in and prepared to go out. She only brushed my hair without saying a word.I didn\u2019t wear any makeup anymore. I really liked it. The doll play was over, and \u2018Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019 was freed from all the bustle after going crazy.Crazy women are forgiven even if they no longer show \u2018courtesy\u2019. It was so funny. I can\u2019t believe I can be freed only when I\u2019m crazy.Dozens of eyes followed me. The servant chief guided me to the emperor\u2019s office without a word.There was no special greeting. This was because the marquis may have lost the marquis\u2019 title, and I came here to give up the status of being the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.The emperor watched me silently.He didn\u2019t even tell me to sit down. He knocked on the desk a few times and quietly brought it up.\u201cYou\u2019re being quite clever. Are you doing this to break Alecto?\u201d\u201cIf I had wanted that, I wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d\u201cWhat you are doing right now\u201d\u201c-Yes, I know. Of course I know.\u201dI cut off the Emperor\u2019s words. I was too tired to have a trivial power fight. The emperor stared at me. But when he saw my expression, he soon sighed.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cI want to break up my engagement. It\u2019s okay to get rid of the crime, but people\u2019s doubts cannot be prevented. If you push ahead with this marriage, it will certainly be said to be a privilege among the nobles, Perhaps even the position of the imperial family will be shaken.\u201d\u201cDo you see the imperial family being shaken by such a thing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to make it shake. Almost all the commoners already know that the Marquis opened it. In the meantime, you\u2019re holding hands with the Marquis. People will think it\u2019s weird, right?\u201dI tilted my head and glanced at the emperor with my side eyes. I made up a suspicious tone with an innocent voice. Like a person in a play.\u201cWhy does the imperial family, who hate demons so much, embrace the Marquis? Did you shed tears for the witch?\u201dAt that, the emperor snorted at me.\u201cThe witch?\u201d\u201cThe witch even opened the gate to ruin the empire. But the imperial family, deceived by the witch, tries to protect her\u2026.. Wouldn\u2019t it spread widely because it is interesting?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough to call the high priest and prove it. It\u2019s a scheme that is not even good for a third-rate writer.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not a witch, there\u2019s no more reason to defend, is that right?\u201dI slowly moved onto the emperor. I didn\u2019t necessarily erase the smile. I said it to be cheeky.\u201cIf you weren\u2019t misled by me, people would think this, Who\u2019s the culprit if it\u2019s not the Marquis? Who are you to keep interrogating the Marquis without making an announcement? If it\u2019s not the Marquis, and if it\u2019s not another nobleman\u2026\u2026 Isn\u2019t it the imperial family?\u201dThe emperor\u2019s face hardened frighteningly. Looking at his face, I noticed that the emperor already knew. The emperor was also stalling.To find a way to not lose his beloved wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We both knew that even if the story behind this was made known, it would be nothing good for each of us.My weapon will be gone, and he will lose the empress. When everyone went out, I quietly asked the emperor.\u201cBreak the marriage. Or I\u2019ll let everyone know that Her Majesty is the real culprit. Are you going to execute her according to the national law?\u201d\u201cThere is no evidence. The culprit who opened the gate is dead.\u201dThe emperor grinded his teeth. I covered my mouth slightly with my hands and folded my eyes to laugh.\u201cDo you really think there\u2019s no evidence?\u201dThe empress must have left at least one evidence on purpose. And she would have hidden it in a place only he knew. If he didn\u2019t kill the marquis, she might have been willing to reveal everything and threaten to kill herself.She said he would die from the poison I sent, but there was nowhere he could hide the evidence I had.The emperor looked at my expression and gradually hardened his face. The weight was tilting. It was a battle that could never be won by those who had valuable things.\u201cIt\u2019s enough to kill you and ask about it.\u201d\u201cWho do you think I heard this from? And I\u2019m neither foolish nor naive enough to die alone.\u201dThis was a half lie. In order to go back, Helena had to be killed, so I could not die at the hands of the emperor.There is a stabilizing device called causality, but I wasn\u2019t sure. Still, if the emperor wanted to kill me, even if it was unfair, I would release Kynthia and spread it to the people before I died.\u201c\u2026Is it okay if the engagement is broken?\u201dIn the end, it was the emperor who lowered his tail. smiled widely.\u201cYes, please identify the Marquis as the culprit. That way there will be less talk afterwards.\u201d\u201cThen your father dies.\u201d\u201cI wonder if Your Majesty will spare his life as a token of appreciation for his achievements.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a viper-like girl. You really resemble your father.\u201dIt was funny to hear that the marquis and I are alike even though we don\u2019t have any relationship. After laughing for a while, I bowed my legs slightly and greeted him with sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201dI was about to go out, but suddenly turned my head and told the emperor. Oh, I can\u2019t forget this.\u201cAnd make Helena Antebellum the Crown Princess.\u201d\u201cAntebellum? Isn\u2019t that child a low-born?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The moment she becomes the Crown Princess, she will be the most precious blood, Since the Her Majesty the Empress loved her as much as her daughter, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be more pleased than with any other ladies\u201dThe emperor burst into laughter.\u201cThat\u2019s what you did too. Teaching and decorating her and sending her to the Crown Prince\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow could I have recklessly dressed her up in the color of the royal family? It was possible because Her Majesty approved it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity. More than Antebellum, who can not do anything other than cry, the imperial family is the place where you, who are spirited, are more likely to survive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to survive\u2026. everything.\u201dAs soon as I opened the door, I was amazed by what heard. I sighed and corrected the emperor\u2019s misunderstanding. No matter how tough Helena becomes, she will not survive in the imperial family,\u201cHow can you say that there\u2019s no one alive in this imperial family?\u201dI went out without looking back. I really hoped this would be the last meeting with the emperor.As I was about to go back, the crown prince walked by from afar. My feet stopped as if they were frozen. My heart was tightening.The crown prince also looked surprised to see me for a while. But what surprised me was that for a moment, he passed by as if nothing had happened. There was no feeling of guilt in the eyes that looked at me. It was just full of embarrassment.I was dumbfounded and the corners of my mouth went up. How\u2019s that possible? How can you be so okay? I\u2019m having a hard time. I\u2019m going crazy. Why are you okay?I wanted to hold onto him. I wanted to slap him on the cheek like he did to me that day and swear that he was as bad as a beast. If you have a conscience, kneel down and beg me. Like that\u2026\u2026 I was going to tell him. But suddenly, I remembered what the witch said.\u2013 All the other people\u2019 don\u2019t remember. It wasn\u2019t there in the first place. I don\u2019t know if it will really benefit you or not.Oh, it didn\u2019t happen. My mouth slowly opened. All the memories and words from that night, being forced to commit a crime, became illusions.I remembered it clearly\u2026\u2026It was still this clear. But I can\u2019t ask him anymore because the sin never happened. There was a victim, but the perpetrator disappeared.How can you do this? My jaw trembled when I clenched it. Who should I blame?I leaned against the wall because I didn\u2019t want to sit down even though my legs were weak. I closed my eyes.As time went by, it would have been nice if my memory disappeared as well. If I hadn\u2019t known anything\u2026\u2026.When I opened the door to the carriage, Anakin was waiting for me. It was not until I met his face that! burst into tears. I had no choice but to pour despair into his arms. The carriage ran fast. The sound of horseshoes concealed my crying.\u201cHe\u2019s the one who made a mistake. Why should I suffer? Why am I the only one suffering?\u201d\u201cArgh! Argh! Argh!\u201dAnakin hugged me tightly. I know it\u2019s not my fault. But now I have no one left to resent.The marquis was back. He was hollow and thin.From his physical condition, it seemed that there was no physical torture, but sometimes mental torture worked better than physical. He became ten years older in that short time.As soon as he saw me meet him, he grinded his teeth, but he didn\u2019t say anything because he cared about the eyes of his servants.I chased after him without saying a word. When! followed the marquis into his office, he pushed me to the door, he brought his face closer and asked.\u201cWhy did you go to the academy that day?\u201d\u201cI wanted to see the fireworks. Are you suspecting me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not four years old, if so who are you!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sad when someone who committed a lot of crimes says that\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I laughed, the marquis punched the wall next to me. I crookedly looked up at him.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try hitting your daughter, who is rumored to be crazy, now? Then you\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already done, you stupid thing\u2026..!\u201dThe marquis moved away from my body.He was thinking about something, hovering around the same spot. I lifted my body, leaning against the door, and asked faintly.\u201cCan you guess the culprit?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to know\u2026\u2026. If you hadn\u2019t broken up with the imperial family\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? If I hadn\u2019t broken up, do you think you\u2019d be acquitted?\u201dTo put it bluntly, the marquis had been \u2018nearly acquitted as he thought. It was because I hit the player first before him and made a deal with the emperor, so it was canceled. There was no need to tell the truth. In order to urge the Marquis, it is necessary to create a virtual enemy. (PR/N: she struck first, and so she won.)\u201cThen think about it this way. Who will benefit from my breakup\u2026\u201dAs I whispered, the marquis\u2019s expression hardened. Do you see any faces that come to mind? This might make the story easier. The marquis\u2019 mouth twitched and spat out a single last name.Seeing the shape of his mouth, my head turned quickly. I had read it in the book.He was one of the imperial nobles who would later help Helena.\u201cThe emperor tried to bring you down. The emperor knew you didn\u2019t open the gate, but he condoned it to keep his strength in check.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty\u2026 No way.\u201d\u201cAre you really sure? Has the Emperor never once betrayed you?\u201dI said it in a provocative way on purpose.The marquis\u2019 mouth was firmly closed by my words.Once the doubt was planted, it would sprout and grow in him.He will pull out all the memories of the past, contrast them and find questions. And he will create his own absurdity. It would soon become a plausible fiction that will replace reality.Because the marquis needs an excuse.\u201cWas it the noble family of the Emperor faction that pushed my breakup? They knew that the Crown Prince loved Helena\u2026 so they must have secretly taught Helena. They were weaving the board under the water.\u201d (Q/N: meaning, the ones who pulled the strings.)The marquis\u2019 pupils grew. I raised my voice to heighten my excitement. Because I had to make him my puppet and move him as I wanted.\u201cTo make her the Crown Princess. If you make her a puppet, you\u2019ll be able to regain power and take revenge!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you saying this to me? What do you want from me?\u201dThe marquis scoured through my expression as if searching for my intentions. It was understandable to be suspicious. Because I\u2019ve been hostile to him so far.It was weirder for a suspicious human like the marquis to suddenly believe in me.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too sad to lose everything like this? It\u2019s not toolate.\u201dI whispered more tenderly on purpose.Like, your enemy is not me.\u201cIf Helena dies, won\u2019t he have no choice but to use me as the Crown Princess again?\u201dThe marquis trembled at the whisper. He crumpled his face a little and said.\u201cWhat does that mean? How can you become a Crown Princess again just because Antebellum dies?\u201d\u201cThink about it. There\u2019s no sense of compassion in society. Then should the Crown Prince be made into an old bachelor?I didn\u2019t go to many social gatherings, but I got a rough idea after going out twice to Young Lady Kazar\u2019s party,None of the aristocratic women of my age had a fianc\u00e9. We couldn\u2019t wait for the girls who didn\u2019t even go through the debutante ball yet because they were too young.Young Lady Kazar has not yet been engaged, But when the Duke of Kazar was awarded the title of duke as a contributor to the founding of the country, he swore that he would not become an outcast of the imperial family.Can the crown prince marry a princess from another country? It was impossible for him too. This was because, in the empire, there was no princess of marriageable age.This ridiculous disaster occured when the author tried to give the probability of Helena, a lower maid, somehow marrying the crown prince.In the original work, Helena was not reinstated as a nobleman for no reason. The marquis\u2019 expression while listening to me shook for a moment. He asked in a locked voice.\u201cSo what?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 69To Get Myself Back\u201cGet me a poisonous cup secretly. That stupid child is weak-hearted and won\u2019t be able to refuse my request for a cup of tea.\u201dWhen I spoke confidently, the marquis, who had been contemplating, finally nodded. The marquis had nothing to lose anyway. I sang with joy inside, but didn\u2019t bother to show it. When I tried to go out, the marquis grabbed me.\u201cBut\u2026 Why are you suddenly seeking the position of Crown Princess? Wasn\u2019t it that you didn\u2019t like him?\u201dSometimes in life, there are moments when not only white lies but also disgusting lies should be told. Words that you have to say even though it feels like sores are going to grow on your tongue if you say them. I don\u2019t know if it was misfortune or luck, but the only thing that came out here was a lie.\u201cThis is what we usually call pushing and pulling\u2026\u201dI wanted to push him to death, I wanted to pull him and stab him with a knife.\u201cCome to think of it, it may not be bad to marry a young and powerful person and live a comfortable life. More than anything\u2026 he\u2019s handsome, right?\u201dOnly then did the marquis look relieved.Keep your guard off like that. I really want you to think I\u2019m immature. That way, I\u2019ll be able to take your breath away. (QC/N: in the sense of make you stop breathing.)The marquis got a cup a few days later. It was a beautiful cup, one with a white body and delicate golden work.The circumference of the soft curve resembled the flowers in full bloom, and the arabesque pattern was densely engraved. When I lifted the cup and smelled it slightly, there was no scent.The marquis looked at me as I was examining the cup and said,\u201cIt looks the same on the outside, but if you look closely, there is a slight difference on the side of the handle.\u201dListening to the marquis, one cup had four petals on the handle side.\u201cA teacup with four petals is poisonous. Grab the unpoisoned teacup first and drink tea to avoid suspicion.\u201dAccording to my original plan, both the empress and the emperor had to be poisoned and die.Well, I thought the empress would take care of it.It didn\u2019t matter if the empress survived. The empress would kill me if I wanted to. She was a woman who understood the desire to die better than anyone else. I picked up the cup and said,\u201cThank you. But this cup\u2026 Where did you get it?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t I know? I don\u2019t want the cup to be tracked down, and then accused of poisoning her.\u201dThe marquis sighed and looked at me with a pathetic face.\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. A craftsman told me to melt the poison in water and apply it with a brush, it can kill even if you consume a very small amount of it. When hot water is poured, the poison will melt naturally and disappear.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s such a deadly poison, you could die before you finish drinking your tea. What if poison is detected in the remaining tea water?\u201d\u201cTouch the glass pretending to be surprised and spill the contents, or do as you please. Do I have to teach you everything?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true too. Okay. I\u2019ll take care of it. Anyway, he must be a skilled craftsman. It\u2019s so pretty that I don\u2019t want to waste it.\u201dConsidering that it was made in a hurry, it was not wasted even if it was used in the imperial palace. spinned the cup and looked at it, then asked as I was \u2018spilling\u2019 the contents of the cup.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask this craftsman for another teacup, but who is it?\u201d\u201cKilled. I can\u2019t leave a sprout of danger behind.\u201dThe marquis spoke at once. As expected, he was not a man who would leave any regrets behind. I nodded harshly. This time, the marquis asked me.\u201cWhen are you going to use that cup?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always a right time for everything. I\u2019ll use it when I want, so don\u2019t rush me. If you don\u2019t like it, you can poison Helena with this cup.\u201d\u201cYou are such a boorish girl.\u201d\u201cYou know what? His Majesty said you and I arealike.\u201dI wrinkled my nose and threw the final blow to scratch his insides.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to do, so why don\u2019t you go back to the estate and enjoy hunting? Or go to any villa and enjoy forest bathing. Oh, or have you perhaps lost all your villas?\u201d (PR/N:like sunbathing, but in the forest, for peace and tranquility!)The marquis only maintained his marquis status and was deprived of all other real rights. All of them were seized by the Imperial Palace except for the ones in the eastern Kendal region, where he was born.As I stabbed at the sore spot, the marquis\u2019 expression hardened terribly. I should hurry up and get out of here before he starts going insane.When I was about to lie down on the bed, the maid, led me to Anakin for a walk.When the doctor told me that walking and sunlight would help me feel better, the maid seemed to thinkthat if I didn\u2019t follow the instructions, she would die. So I sat still in the garden and waited for Anakin.I had a dream for the first time in a long time, yesterday. It was a dream about killing the crown prince. As soon as I woke up from my dream, I threw up on the washbasin. I killed a person.Still, no regrets. But even if it was a fictional person, even if he tried to harm me, to kill a person was to kill him. Even though the time has been deleted, the moment was still so vivid to me\u2026.. I felt guiltyWhen I thought about whether there were other options, the answer was no. However, the murder couldn\u2019t be overlooked just because it was unavoidable.Would it have been a little different if I ran out without stopping to breathe and called a doctor? No, they were all useless assumptions.The crown prince, who died by my hands, lives and breathes intact without remembering, and I\u2019m going crazy alone in pain.Even when I first met Hubris, Hubris said that my soul was in tatters.How about now? Is it festering like mold? Or is it crushed to the point where you can\u2019t find its form?This was how overwhelming accidentally killing the crown prince was, but Helena. How dare I kill that child? That innocent girl\u2026\u2026 How dare I\u2026 How\u2026\u2026.Anakin was seen in the distance. He found me and started running a little faster.I wanted to die, but it was still cloudy.\u201cHave you been waiting for a long time?\u201dIt was still cloudy.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t wait that long. I want to hold hands.\u201dThe weather\u2026\u2026It was still cloudy. So I didn\u2019t cry, and we could walk together for a long time.Anakin, but I wanted to ask you something. Will you be sad when I die?Can I still kill her?Anakin and I have been at peace for a while. The doctor recommended that I rest for a while in a cottage with good air because I absolutely need stability.Considering what will happen in the future, I could not leave the capital, so I instead decorated a small cottage attached to the mansion and lived alone. There, we could see each other anywhere when we turned our heads.We acted like newlyweds. No, I don\u2019t know what Anakin thought, but I felt that way.At night, Anakin closed his eyes on the floor and closed my eyes on the bed. When I opened my eyes from a seizure during sleep, I saw Anakin right under my feet.Then I was suddenly relieved and could close my eyes again.Anakin sometimes picked up an ax and chopped firewood. Thanks to it, the fireplace in the house never went out.In addition to heating this small cottage, the fireplace also served various functions, such as heating tea or milk, and baking potatoes as snacks. Still, I couldn\u2019t cook properly, so the food was brought to the door by the maids every morning.When we were full, we took a nap under the sunny sun. It was our daily routine to wake up, eat lunch brought from the mansion, play chess games while taking a nap, talk, eat dinner brought by our servants, and fall asleep.Anakin had never played chess, but as soon as I gave him the rough rules, he quickly learned them and became a good opponent.I learned knitting from him, probably because the stitches stretched out so badly, Anakin had to untangle the doubled stitches again.If this was a dream, I would fall asleep again and want to continue to dream. Living like this would have been enough to weaken my heart that it was not bad to live here.It was just that I liked him, but I had no way of knowing what he was thinking when adjusting to my rhythm. Anakin was reticent, and he was always in a position to listen rather than speak up first.But if I brought it up for no reason, I was terrified of hearing the response that he was simply being nice to me because I was his master.Rather than breaking my hand into a broken dream, it\u2019s just\u2026\u2026 I kept wanting to be mistaken.In the meantime, the breakup of Eris Mis\u00e9rian was officially announced. It should have been published in the newspaper, but it was probably blocked by the imperial side. Well, there was no need to make a fuss. After all, an article about the new engagement of the crown prince was better than an article about the broken engagement anyway.When the empress sent me a person, our house play was over. I had to dress up again and go to the Imperial Palace.secretly took the cup the marquis gave me, then got in the carriage and looked at Anakin. Somehow Anakin looked worried.I soothed him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have you.\u201dMaybe that was something he wanted to say to me. Anakin nodded silently at my words. He hesitated and spoke quietly.\u201cIf you can\u2019t stand it\u2026.. Run away to the witch. In the meantime, I\u2019ll buy time.\u201dI bowed my head because I laughed at the faithful word. Hearing those words, my mind sobered up. It was crazy to think about burying my bones in this unfamiliar world.I shouldn\u2019t have said that.It wasn\u2019t just a matter of loved ones. Here, I had to think and talk like Lady Mis\u00e9rian, so I was gradually forgetting what I was originally like.I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201cI won\u2019t run away, Anakin.\u201dThad to move on to get myself back. To get my face, my voice and my thoughts back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The imperial palace was the place where all the seafood and delicacies could be found, but how skinny she was.No matter how good you live and eat, everything is useless if you are not happy. When I said that Her Majesty was also skinny, the empress laughed.I didn\u2019t come to the imperial palace to talk about such trivial things. I took out the teacup that had been hidden well in my arms and handed it over to the empress. The empress looked at the teacup, but did not bother picking it up.\u201cThere is poison on the teacup with four petals near the handle.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that we\u2019ll die together?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Isn\u2019t it enough for the Empress to drink tea again after feeding the Emperor?\u201dAt that, the Empress laughed, and then she picked up the teacup and began to examine it.\u201cIt would be an implicit rule to make a teacup like this one to be used only once so as to not leave traces\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know. Then do whatever you want. Do I have to tell you how to do it?\u201dWhen I deliberately imitated the marquis and spoke, the empress tilted her head slowly and made eye contact.I gave her the teacup, and if I stayed here longer, I felt like I would only be robbed of my feelings by the sly empress, so I hurriedly stood up. (PR/N: as in, like she would confess everything to the empress.)\u201cThen, bye.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.If you are caught for murder, you will be locked up in the room where you were detained last time.\u201dI turned my head and looked at the empress. She fixed her gaze on the empty window and continued to talk.\u201cThere is a secret passage under the bed in the room. If you go down the stairs of the passage, it leads to the underground passage you\u2019ve been to last time. It is a secret escape route that has been handed down only to the royal family from generation to generation in case of a rebellion.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to be in the royal family anymore, so I\u2019ll just pretend I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201dWhy are you suddenly trying to save me when you hate the marquis and want to kill me? Is this her own version of repaying a favor? In that case, it was in vain. My goal was to get revenge, not to survive after. I smiled and spoke with a cold face.\u201cYour Majesty is not the only one who wants death.\u201dThe empress stared at me blankly with her eyes open. Finally, she laughed as if crying. Her red eyes were wet, but they did not shed tears, her voice did not tremble.Some people would call that broken appearance \u2018the example of the imperial family. She whispered quietly.\u201cHow\u2026 How come all the people I tried to save don\u2019t listen to me?\u201dHearing those words, I remembered the theater stage. Was Alecto\u2019s older brother detained there? Did the empress beg him, but he died there without escaping through the passage under the bed?\u2026\u2026 How many more stories are there left in this world that I haven\u2019t read?When I opened the door and came out, the crown prince was waiting. I was frightened, but when I remembered the eyes of that time, I thought it was an overreaction.It\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t even remember anyway. It was only my loss to hold on to and swear at what was now gone.I killed him, so that was it, and I was determined to pass by, but the crown prince suddenly grabbed me by the wrist. My heart dropped.My legs were weak and I was dragged helplessly While my mind went blank, there was only one thing! came up with.I had to call Anakin. I think he was near here.The moment I barely spoke, the crown prince strongly shook my hand. I hit the wall while recoiling and managed not to collapse. My back was throbbing, Leaning against the wall, I stared at the crown prince. He was also glaring at me.\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\u201cDid you not learn even the minimum etiquette towards a lady?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Is it true that you wanted to break our engagement?\u201dI was wondering what you were talking about, but was it just that? I was dumbfounded, so I raised my head and laughed. When I laughed, the crown prince approached, grabbed my shoulder with both hands, and screamed.\u201cI\u2019m asking if it\u2019s true!\u201d\u201cYeah! You wanted it too. This broken engagement. Am I the only one who wanted it? How dare you yell at me instead of being thankful?\u201dThe crown prince had a rather embarrassed face as I was angry. Almost there. Now, there was no need to imprison me just because \u2018Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019 was crazy.Disliking the marquis, unless you\u2019re the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, that\u2019s all it takes to kill him. I shook off his hand on my shoulder and responded.\u201cSpeaking of which, correct your yelling habit. Are you deaf? If you shout frequently, you\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d\u201cHow dare you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow dare you! What are you going to do?\u201dHe flinched when I stomped on his feet. It was a corridor in the imperial palace in broad daylight, so there were many eyes and ears. You can hit me, but you won\u2019t do what I\u2019m worried about. I tilted my head slightly and acted cheeky.\u201cIf you\u2019re so angry and upset, you should at least cut my throat for insulting the royal family, Your Highness. It will last a long time for future generations to come As the crown prince who killed his ex-fianc\u00e9e with his own hands.\u201dThe crown prince made a strange and complex expression. Somehow, the relationship between Eris and the crown prince seemed to have an invisible formula established.Eris was blind and the crown prince refused. The crown prince got angry, and Eris put up with it. When the formula collapsed, the prince was at a loss.\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2026. changed\u201d\u201cDid I change? Me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThat\u2019s the only word he finally spat out.I imitated Eris. Except for the marquis, no one noticed that I was not Eris.I don\u2019t think I impersonated her well. It\u2019s just\u2026..that you weren\u2019t interested.If you cut your hair, you should know that your hair was long. That\u2019s why makeup, tone of voice, attitude\u2026 If someone notices when small things change, it proves that that person was paying attention to you that much.It was probably for the same reason that you constantly ask your loved ones about it.He said I changed, but he can\u2019t even recognize the reason I changed. One side of my chest cooled down. The more I quarreled, the more I felt like my intelligence was dropping, so I turned around.I was going to turn around. If only the crown prince\u2019s words hadn\u2019t set fire to it.\u201cYou love me.\u201dHow dare you\u2026.\u201cCan you say such a thing?\u201dMy teeth trembled. Love? How dare you put that in your mouth?I\u2019m not Eris Mis\u00e9rian, so I can never imitate her perfectly.Many things were different between her and I.The way she talked, habits, personality\u2026..Among the many differences, what he recognized was the very insignificant reason, \u2018Eris does not love the Crown Prince.It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know how variable emotions were, but he couldn\u2019t believe that Eris no longer loved the crown prince.He began to suspect her only because she didn\u2019t love the crown prince.Is loving the crown prince the significance of Eris\u2019 existence?I couldn\u2019t stand it. I couldn\u2019t even define exactly what this seething emotion was. Ah, madness. Yes, I was caught in madness, laughed and quietly said to the crown prince.\u201cDo you want me to tell you a funny story?\u201dI approached and grabbed the crown prince\u2019s cheeks. I put my body close to his frozen body and said, whatever that came to mind.\u201cThere was a girl. A girl who believed that she would be the Crown Princess. I don\u2019t know why she dreamed of being a Crown Princess. From the time she could think she grew up hearing that she\u2019ll become the Crown Princess, or perhaps was it a small desire to fall in love with the Crown Prince like a fool and marry him\u2026.?\u201d\u201cEris Mis\u00e9rian-\u201c.\u201cListen! Just shut up and listen. By the way\u2026 The girl, who had been trying to grow up as a Crown Princess all her life, suddenly thought that her efforts might beuseless. She couldn\u2019t dream of love, but she won\u2019t even get any reward even if she tried this hard.\u201dI wanted to tear this face apart. Why did I come all the way here? Why did I fall into an unfamiliar world and suffer? I was embarrassed and squeezed out the laughter. My eyes gleamed.\u201cThat\u2019s why the girl made a wish. She wanted to disappear from this world. It was supposed to end with just the wind, but my goodness\u2026\u2026 What should I do? Well, whether it was luck or misfortune, the dragon that was passing by made the wish come true in exchange for her heart.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026..!\u201d\u201cYou know\u2026. Then, guess who I am?\u201dA trivial question caused a ripple.Soon, it became a huge disaster and swallowed the man in front of me.The man looked at me with a frightened face I had never seen before.As if he had finally seen a stranger.Alecto was born as a crown prince and raised as a crown prince. That means that as soon as he learned how to walk, he had to learn self-defense, and as soon as he started speaking, he learnt Caesareanism. (PRN: Caesareanism refers to special education for successors of royal families, it is not a discipline with a clear definition and does not correspond to the education of the general.)Alecto had to get up on his own even if he fell. It was natural for the crown prince of the empire, but it was harsh for an underdeveloped child.He had the name Alecto, but no one called him that, For everyone, Alecto was only the \u2018Crown Prince\u2019 or \u201cHis Highness\u2019.His father, the emperor, was not interested in him from the beginning, and his mother, the empress, treated Alecto coldly as he grew up.The nanny was also friendly to Alecto on the outside, but it was only an act conscious of people\u2019s eyes. When others didn\u2019t see it, she just treated Alecto obligatorily. There was no affectionate touch or even a common compliment.If you were to ask him whether the nanny scolded him, she did not, but in the vast imperial palace, Alecto had no place to turn to.And indifference was sometimes crueler than violence.At first, he tried.He just had to do better.Then he did well, and he believed that they would praise and love him.However, hope was worn out by the constant contempt. Alecto became a cold boy worthy of the imperial palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At first, Alecto thought she was an angel because she was fair and pretty.The fact that she was clumsy and ignorant also played a part in the suspicion. For angels living in the sky, the ground must be a strange place.However, when he looked closely, she was wearing a lower maid\u2019s uniform and had no wings behind her. Above all, the temperature of the hand holding his hand and leading him was warm.Perhaps she thought he was a noble child who came to visit the Imperial Palace to play, and she offered a gentle guide.If she was an angel, he would ask her to take him to heaven as it was. Heaven was warm and cozy, so it was said that you will be happy to live there.However, Alecto held her hand silently because he also liked her leading him to the exit from the imperial garden.Alecto pretended to be a noble child and kept hanging out with her. For the first time, he skipped class and went around the imperial palace. Her name was Helena. The child called him Alec. She was the nanny\u2019s daughter. She was certainly far from being polite, but that was better.Helena was the only one who saw Alecto as Alecto, Alecto deceived her that he wasn\u2019t the crown prince, but that was a secondary problem. Either way, to a low-ranking maid, he was a high-ranking person who, whether as a prince or a child of a noble family, could not be approached the same.Gradually, Alecto began to rely emotionally on Helena, He always thought of Helena. He liked the child.The way she smiled was pretty, bright, innocent and lovely. Even if she was clumsy, she always tried. He always wanted to be with her because he was comfortable with her.Alecto didn\u2019t know the name of the emotion yet.\u2013 Yo, Your Highness, Prince\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ve been rude. Fo, forgive me.However, one day, when he saw Helena, who hesitated to speak to \u2018His Highness the Crown Prince\u2019, and looked at him as if she had been scolded, he thought he didn\u2019t want to be distant. He didn\u2019t want to meet her as the crown prince and a maid.\u2013 Don\u2019t call me\u2026.. like that.There were so many people who called him that way in this Imperial Palace, so he hoped that only a single person, the girl in front of him, would not. He just wanted to treat them as Helena and Alec. Alecto was terrified of losing his first warmth.\u2013 Don\u2019t call me like that\u2026 pleaseAlecto begged for the first time in his life.He didn\u2019t even know how to kneel, so he just put his head on Helena\u2019s shoulder and prayed in a small voice. As soon as she lowered her gaze, he could see Helena clenching and spreading her fist as if embarrassed.She could have blamed him for being an immature baby.It was okay to criticize him for not being like a crown prince. If he could just hold onto this child\u2026\u2026.Helena slowly lifted Alecto\u2019s head with warm hands She said affectionately, wiping away tears that he didn\u2019t even know were flowing.\u2013 Then we\u2026 Are we friends?Friend. He remembered the son of the Duke of Kazar whom he met not too long ago. When he wanted to be close to his peers, he thought he called them similarly. If it could keep them together.Alecto nodded. From that day on, Alecto and Helena became friends.Alecto didn\u2019t like Eris Mis\u00e9rian from the beginning. The child was so different from Helena. Expensive clothes, made-up laughter, mature tone\u2026\u2026 When their eyes met, he hated the attitude of trying hard to get a good impression.They said she was the child chosen as his fianc\u00e9,He was already tired of having to marry a small and young-looking child. If he had to get married, it would have been nice if the other person was Helena. Alecto clicked his tongue.When Eris and the marquis reluctantly left the palace and returned, the nanny fidgeted as usual. When asked why, she poured out words as if she had waited. He could even see madness in her eyes.The fact that the nanny was originally Madam Antebellum, and the former crown prince and the Antebellum family, who were trapped by the marquis scheme, were executed for treason.Even the fact that the nanny, who had Helena in her stomach, was barely able to survive at the earnest request of his mother, who was the nanny\u2019s biological friend.\u2013 It\u2019s the world\u2019s most evil family, Your Highness!When he learned the truth, he felt dizzy. The cold treatment of his mother and nanny, the neglect of his father, and the imperial palace people who were found to have a hard time\u2026..Only then could he notice all the reasons. However, knowing and understanding were different issues. Alecto was not convinced.\u2013 Father\u2026 No, Your Majesty why\u2026\u2026The nanny couldn\u2019t say anything and began to cry. Alecto rubbed his face with his hands. Suddenly, he thought of that. If it weren\u2019t for the marquis, maybe it would have been Helena who entered the palace to become his fiance.They might have been able to walk side by side for the rest of their life without lying to her from the beginning, perhaps not as a friend.A corner of his heart cooled down.Hate sprouted like that.Eris Mis\u00e9rian was luxurious. She spent hundreds of gold coins on what she wore and ate. Her personality was so hateful that she caught even the smallest things and acted like a bully.She was \u2018His Highness\u2019 fiance\u2019 and so she exerted all kinds of prestige.Rumors, rumors, rumors. Alecto was sick of the constantly heard gossip.He heard that she appeared at Lady Morgan\u2019s debutante ball with the same dress as hers because she ignored her. Furthermore, when he heard that she took away her partner and made him her partner, he was dumbfounded.Alecto knew that it was one of the tricks she did to attract his attention. That\u2019s because she shamelessly talked about it in person at the meeting after the debutante ball.\u2013 What does that have to do with me?He didn\u2019t want to make Eris happy by being angry and jealous. Alecto deliberately pretended not to know more. He thought that even the face hiding disappointment was abominable.Above all, what he couldn\u2019t stand was the fact that Eris had secretly harassed his own person, Helena Helena was suffering alone without telling anyone because she was soft and good by nature, and he only noticed it after seeing the nail marks left on her body by chance.Leaving Helena behind, he raised his voice as soon as Eris entered the palace. At first, Eris pretended to be innocent, but later went there and became nervous about whether he was angry.\u2013 She is a lowly person who cleans the palace, Your Highness! How can you do this to me?\u2013 How dare you call the crown prince\u2019s little sibling lowly? What are you! (QC/N: babies that grew up by being fed with the same adult\u2019s milk, but were born from different mothers \u2013 not real siblings, but \u2018bosom\u2019/\u2019milk\u2019 siblings.)\u2013 Are you putting me on the same level as that?\u2013 What do you mean? It\u2019s not even fair. (T/N: he is saying Eris isn\u2019t even worth to be put in the same place as in Helena)When a hint of hope came across Eris\u2019 face, anger flickered across. She was so young, but she was evil like her father, and there was no such thing as affection.\u2013 People like you can\u2019t keep up with Helena\u2019s toes.Finally, her contorted little face was refreshing. He always wanted to see that expression. The dark, ugly bare face with the mask of smiling innocently removed.The more Eris tried, the more Alecto cared about Helena. Helena had always made him comfortable.Family, friends, lovers\u2026\u2026. Helena was a being who filled everything he lacked. There was nothing more he could wish for with Helena\u2026. he thought so.On an early summer day when the sun was good, he thought it would be nice to sit in the back garden and enjoy refreshments with Helena, he had an attendant and called her.The chief servant visited and talked to him, saying he should go to the empress.His body stiffened. It had been a long time since his mother called for him.He wiped off the sweat on his hands and entered the room.However, even though he entered the room, she did not give a single glance. It was just that Lady Mis\u00e9rian left the palace and told him to go to the back garden to see her off.Since he can\u2019t hate your mother, sadness and anger are endlessly focused on \u2018objects you can hate.\u2019He could see Eris curled up in a corner far away. Even though she tried not to make a sound because she was the child of a snake, she quickly raised her body and looked that way. The face of the child who recognized him gradually brightened.The tears were removed, but the red nose and eyes were not hidden. However, Alecto pretended they weren\u2019t necessarily real. Because it had nothing to do with him.\u2013 Are you here to see me off?\u2013 Hurry up and get out of the palace.\u2013 I\u2019ll see you again as soon as possible. Someday, Your Highness will get attached to me.When he heard that, he unintentionally spit out his sincerity. Some truth was colder and sharper than any other insult. That\u2019s what he said that day.\u2013 I wish you hadn\u2019t been born.The girl\u2019s pupils got bigger. As if she had heard something she shouldn\u2019t have heard, she blinked cluelessly. Alecto knew he made a mistake, but he didn\u2019t know how to apologize. No, he didn\u2019t want to apologize. Finally, tears fell out of the girl\u2019s eyes again,\u2013 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I should get going now\u2026..Eris hurriedly left the place.Alecto went back to the empress silently and reported the progress, and lied for the first time when she asked if Eris had cried. Somehow he felt like he had toEris soon returned to having a smiling face. Alecto thought he was tired of it, but on the other hand, he was relieved. From that afternoon, Alecto became increasingly insensitive to the mistreatment of Eris. But he thought it was okay.Until one day when he was informed that she was unable to enter the Imperial Palace due to an accident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 72Dichotomous ThinkingAt first, he thought it was a trick to attract attention. However, only after hearing the news that she had been stabbed by an unidentified man did this kind of suspicion go away a little. He couldn\u2019t see her in front of him, so he seemed to have forgotten for a while.When he finally heard that Eris Mis\u00e9rian had entered the palace again, Alecto felt happy initially.After the greetings with the emperor were over, she would probably come over here for tea time. It didn\u2019t matter how much attention he paid to her, she didn\u2019t forget to go to him every single time.\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re later than usual.\u201d\u201c\u2026..disrespectful. It\u2019s a dazzling afternoon, Your Highness and Helena.\u201dShe looked a little thin but it was said she was sick. No wonder the atmosphere was so calm. I thought she grew up after being sick, but when she ordered Helena as if she was dealing with an attendant, he clicked his tongue, saying that people didn\u2019t change easily.But technically, Helena was not a noble, so Alecto just stared at Eris silently. This was because whenever heglared at her, Eris used to become a little selfconscious and pretended to be sweet to Helena,However, Eris did not give in to his gaze and snapped.\u201cAs Your Highness said, we\u2019re close friends\u2026\u2026 Is it against the law to ask your friend for a cup of tea?\u201dHelena stopped Alecto before he got angry at her cheeky response. Helena mediated between the two, imitating the mischievous words.Alecto was dissatisfied with her being treated like that, but his anger melted away like snow because of Helena, who lightly patted her lips and laughed.When Jason, who returned from a long journey, approached, the atmosphere became more friendly Although it was initially a mandatory meeting between the imperial family and aristocratic children, as time passed, Alecto realized that his time with Jason was quite enjoyable.Because Jason was a good-natured person, he was kind to Alecto, who was on the tough side, and he did not show any reluctance because Helena was a commoner.By comparison, Eris was always like a corner that stuck out.Every time they met, she reluctantly \u2018put up with Jason, the son of the duke, and pretended to be friendly with Helena, who didn\u2019t have to endure it, yet she subtly treated her as the attendant of the group.Naturally, when they gathered together, she had no choice but to be alienated. No, he intentionally alienated her.Because he didn\u2019t like her.She was hurting his pride as usual, so he hoped for her to leave, but she rubbed it in today of all days. He couldn\u2019t stand the amount of advice she gave to Helena, so when she got up, Helena hugged and stopped him.When Eris left, Jason shook his head and laughed.\u201cStill, Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s always arrogant.\u201d\u201cYou must have been tired. There has been a lot of work lately.\u201dAs soon as he heard Helena\u2019s voice, his mind became clearer. She was as kind as an angel.He always blamed himself for not being able to tell others when he hated something. How could one hate a child like this so much? He believed that if the witch was alive, she would be like Eris.Alecto always had a tendency to think in a dichotomous way, and for him, Eris was always classified as \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018hate\u2019.The same was true when Eris entered the Imperial Palace again shortly after. When the escort knight stopped the child, who had been close to Helena, from breathlessly running to him, the child fell flat on her face and begged the crown prince.\u201cYour Highness! Lady Mis\u00e9rian is bothering Helena again! Please help me!\u201d\u201c\u2026..Where is she?\u201dWhen he went in a hurry as the child led him, he could see Eris scolding Helena. He held his throbbing head and turned Eris\u2019 body around. Looking down silently, she didn\u2019t back down and met his eyes. Unfortunately, there was no sign of remorse in her eyes.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, you didn\u2019t change at all. No, you are getting more and more shameless.\u201d\u201cIt is a dazzling afternoon, Your Highness. For those of high standing, that is a virtue.\u201dAlecto\u2019s head was heated up by her sarcastic voice. It was ridiculous for Eris to say that the higher the status, the more generous one should be to the lower, and that it was a virtue while she persecuted the lower. In front of himself, one of the highest ranked people in the country.\u201cHow dare you discuss your status in front of me now?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, because it is me, I can discuss my status in front of Your Highness. Your Highness is engaged to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only an engagement! Do you think the imperial family will tolerate you being arrogant as if you were already the Crown Princess when the marriage is not yet certain?\u201dEris Mis\u00e9rian always acted as if she was from the royal family. If it weren\u2019t for the marquis, she wouldn\u2019t be able to sit there.It occurred to him that Helena had lost her place to Eris. Then he got even more angry. When he saw the wound on Helena\u2019s palm, his anger reached its peak,Eris\u2019 head turned with a frictional sound. At the same time, Eris and Helena looked at him in disbelief. He said he disliked it, but it was the first time he touched someone.He thought he made a mistake, but it was already spilled water. Alecto deliberately spoke more coldly.\u201cYou scratched what was mine first, so I\u2019ll have to make at least a scratch on you to be fair. Don\u2019t you think so?It was a lame excuse. Alecto himself knew it and tried to leave out of embarrassment. To Alecto, Eris quietly said that it was a marriage between families, so he\u2019ll get married even if he didn\u2019t want to. Eris, who brought it up, somehow looked tired.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you love me and got engaged not too long ago? Is this what you really think?\u201dI love you. You know. That was what Eris said sometime ago during the day. She didn\u2019t cry, but her eyes were wet. Her cheeks were red as she spoke, but maybe it was makeup.Since Eris was good at lying, Alecto doubted everything about her.\u201cI loved you. Not now.\u201dThat\u2019s why Alecto panicked now that the \u2018truth came out of Eris\u2019 mouth. That wasn\u2019t the answer Alecto expected. She still loved him, he thought she would scream out that she did that because she still loved him.He dared to think\u2026.. that, it was the wrong answer.He wanted to break up his engagement to Eris. However, when the opportunity came, his mouth did not open. When he saw Eris\u2019 eyes, who were pressuring him at the knight\u2019s appointment ceremony, his mind became complicated.Alecto concluded that the reason was \u2018because he was not sure. He was not sure that he could break up the engagement, but if he brought it up, it would be a loss.Kratos, his father, was a scary man with no mercy, even if he was his own blood.Alecto thought of his unknown brother, who he heard died by his hands. Even the face of his father, who held no warmth since he saw him when he was young,There was no need to rush. Even if he broke up with Eris, if his next fianc\u00e9 was a woman like Eris, it would be in vain.In order to marry Helena, and no one else, he had to make Helena stand out. That way, his father would not protest later.Thinking of Helena, he remembered Jason confessing to her after the appointment ceremony. He never imagined he would like Helena either.However, Alecto did easily understand. Because anyone would have fallen in love. Everyone liked a child without a single crease.However, when he heard that Jason had decided to take Helena as a partner during Eris\u2019 coming of age ceremony, Alecto also became impatient. Perhaps she read Alecto\u2019s mind, as his mother, Melpomene, called him in.\u201cThe first son of the Duke of Kazar and Helena are paired and will appear at the Coming-of-Age ceremony of the Mis\u00e9rian child, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Did you hear that from Helena?\u201d\u201cHow can I not know anything about your favorite child while sitting here? It will be a good match.\u201dRather, when Alecto couldn\u2019t answer Melpomene\u2019s words, his eyes became cold. Melpomene whispered to Alecto in a low voice.\u201cDidn\u2019t this mother teach you to tell me without hiding what you want and to have what you deserve? How can you look so sad?\u201d\u201cHowever.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no such thing.\u201dWhen Melpomene stated it out directly, Alecto\u2019s body became stiff. Since he grew up unloved, Alecto always struggled with his parents. As Alecto bowed his head, Melpomene spoke to Alecto in a rare friendly voice.\u201cYour mother will take care of it, so escort Helena on the Coming-of-Age Day. It takes time for women to dress up, so I won\u2019t care if you send Duke Kazar to the venue first.\u201d\u201cActually, the fianc\u00e9 has to be the escort at the Coming-of-Age Ceremony\u2026\u2026.\u201dAlecto was bothered by Eris. That\u2019s because it was obvious how Eris would be treated if he didn\u2019t show up. Melpomene laughed when Alecto hesitated.\u201cOh, son. Are you worried about her? She had already done such a thing once. She should now know that she may suffer the same thing. Isn\u2019t that a lesson?\u201d (TL/N: she is referring to the incident with Lady Morgan.)Hearing that, he was determined again.Alecto quietly bowed his head to Melpomene and left the room. He tried to think of it as a causal retribution. She hurt someone else\u2019s heart, so she had to go through the same thing.Finally, on the day of the Coming-of-Age Ceremony, the Helena in front of him bloomed more beautifully than any other woman he had met in his life.She smiled shyly when she saw him because she was unfamiliar with the thick makeup and the dress that would be worn by an aristocrat. Beautiful. When Alecto said his honest appreciation, she stabbed him in his side, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201dWas she still waiting for him in the room? Walking side by side with Helena, Alecto suddenly recalled Eris and soon erased it.It was rude to think of a woman other than Helena when he stole Jason\u2019s partner.And when the door opened with the introduction of the servant, he made eye contact with Eris, who was expressionless, as if she had come in advance.There was no sadness or anger anywhere on that white face. It was just a sign that all of this was boring and exhausting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he grabbed her wrist, Helena put strength in her feet and refused.Without time to appease her screams to change her clothes Eris allowed her, who appeared to have \u2018stolen\u2019 her clothes and fianc\u00e9, to run away. He called Helena as she escaped his grasp, but she ran away without looking back.Everyone\u2019s eyes were on him. Eris smiled with her lips and reached out to Alecto. The dark green eyes were not smiling at all.Silence heavily wrapped around the two. Unable to withstand the pressure, Alecto tried to walk off first, but Eris raised her hand to block him.When asked if he hated her, Alecto approached her without realizing it.When a surprised Alecto stepped back, she even hit her foot against the wall. She looked like a scoundrel on the street.\u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you? You want me to be sick and suffer somehow, right? So even when you came into the hall, you looked at my expression before His Majesty\u2019s. To see if I\u2019m hurt.\u201dIt was true. He found Eris before anyone else. It wasn\u2019t a coincidence. This was because he unconsciously wandered in search of Eris in the crowd.Maybe he wanted her to be hurt as she said. Was she still influencing him\u2026 he wanted to confirm.\u201cBut as for me, Your Highness\u2026\u2026. I wish I was dead.\u201dAlecto found himself hurt by the words.\u201cSo don\u2019t try to hurt me, you know. Because it\u2019s the same.\u201dEris was moving away. It was not his first time seeing her back, but why did he feel anxious?He believed it would be forgotten if he didn\u2019t see her all the time. However, in the corner of his heart, he kept thinking of that expression of Eris.That indifferent and cold face. There was faint contempt, but it was close to thorough indifference. It was the face that Melpomene used to make when she saw him.The vague anxiety soon became a reality. When he looked for Helena, the attendant hesitated, replying that she was with Eris. Now, whenever Eris entered the palace, she no longer sought him. Alecto hurriedly ran into the room where Helena and Eris were together.There was no welcoming sign anywhere on the face that casually greeted him. Alecto\u2019s teeth were sharpened. Helena, who was looking at the two of them alternately, sneaked in between them.\u201cI, I, I asked Lady Mis\u00e9rian to have a cup of tea. Right, Lady Mis\u00e9rian?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u2026 Without fear! What if that hurt you?\u201dHe looked around to see if Helena was hurt, but she really seemed to have only drank tea. There were no injuries or wet corners in her eyes.He deliberately responded roughly to Eris, who asked if he thought she was a monster as if she was tired of it. At the same time, Alecto carefully pushed Helena\u2019s hair back, who was cautiously looking up at him.She was a precious person. Helena was definitely the only one precious to him.\u201cI\u2019ve got something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about\u2026.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to Lady Kazar\u2019s debutante ball together. As my partner. Don\u2019t you know the child, too?\u201dSo Alecto repeated to himself that he kept looking at Eris because he was annoyed. Eris didn\u2019t feel bad even when she saw their affectionate appearance. Rather, she said she would also attend.\u201cAlone without a partner?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a partner? Isn\u2019t there Anakin?\u201d,\u201cAnakin?\u201d\u201cYou probably saw him last time. My escort knight, Your Highness.\u201dRather, Alecto\u2019s face hardened. He (Anakin) didn\u2019t catch his eye the first time he saw him. Eris, who refused to appoint a knight, reversed her will and picked him herself; he also heard that she was going around with him everywhere.When he looked into that person, they said that he was from an orphanage and was not a particularly skilled person even before he became a knight.It was widely known that Eris thoroughly selected people based on ability, so rumors had circulated that he was Eris\u2019 lover.Did she fall in love? Was that why she has changed like this? Perhaps leaving for the Rundol region for a while was also a love escape with the knight, Alecto guessed. His mouth was bitter. Alecto asked quietly\u201cDoes your father know this?\u201d\u201cIf my father doesn\u2019t know, will you be my partner then? You\u2019re not even going to do that\u2026..\u201d\u201cAre you going to put up an act with the imperial family?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. I\u2019d like to break ties with the imperial family this time.\u201dThe fact that Eris would leave him first\u2026\u2026 he had never thought about it. He had to be happy. Because there was no obstacle. But why was the wind blowing in the corner of his heart?\u201cIf you break your engagement, you\u2019ll become a stranger, so we will not be able to face each other anymore.\u201d\u201cImperial affairs are not something that you can control as you please. Didn\u2019t you say first that it was a marriage between the imperial family and the marquis?\u201d\u201cIt was approved by Her Majesty. Is that an answer?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know. He had met Melpomene several times since then, but she only talked about trivial things, and he had never heard of any of those issues. In the end, both the engagement and breakup, began and ended regardless of his will.Even though his long relationship was cut off, Eris did not even change her expression. Rather, she seemed to think it was strange when she saw his expressionWere endings with someone usually so vain? The confusion was further amplified by the fact that Alecto did not even have a few ended relationships.\u201cYour Highness, didn\u2019t you want this a lot?\u201dSomething was really weird. It was what he wanted so much, but he was not happy at all.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dStanding in front of Alecto, the woman was dazzlingly beautiful. Amethyst violets blooming on silver hair like stars, dresses that cut down the sky by the time the dusk set, and above all, her eyes shining brighter than any other purple color.He felt like one word of admiration was a waste. However, no lengthy description would be enough for Helena\u2019s beauty.Alecto reached out to Helena, and Helena gently placed her hand on his. Eris\u2019 hand was a little bigger than hers.\u201cCrown Prince Alecto is entering with Lady Antebellum\u201d.As the attendant loudly announced his position, the most gorgeous and beautiful flower in the garden, lit up with a thousand lanterns and embroidered with ten thousand flowers, looked back at him.She wrapped her whole body in bright pink, which she usually did not wear, and her eyes containing the chill of early spring briefly stared at him and fell.Alecto suddenly became unfamiliar with everything.He felt like he was alone in a strange world. These were images that he didn\u2019t even know, such as Eris, who saw him insensitively, Helena, who kept her Lady manners and greeted people, and Jason\u2019s eyes that kept following Eris.He felt like he had to stand by Eris even now. However, when the dance song began, Eris naturally held the knight\u2019s hand and left. Looking back at Helena, she looked busy talking to others. Even Helena, who didn\u2019t care about him, was unfamiliar,Perhaps all of this was a dream, he thought.Finally, a familiar figure appeared to him. Eris\u2019 eyes were sparkling with love. Not long ago, he couldn\u2019t believe that Eris\u2019 eyes, who fell in love, would face someone other than him. But now he had to admit it.Eris Mis\u00e9rian no longer loved him.Alecto was trembling so much because he could not regard this simple proposition as true. He dared to be overconfident that the child would love him forever.No, it might have been selfish, but it was what he might have hoped for. Someone who would blindly love him even if it would never get reciprocated.Eris looked happy kissing someone other than him. Alecto saw a face he had never seen. Alecto always saw \u2018the face that Eris wanted to show. Maybe that was why he always hurt her.He wanted to see over the mask. He wanted to face Eris\u2019 true feelings because it was okay to laugh, cry or get angry. What should he call that feeling?He was sure it was not love. If this twisted thing was called love, the twisted feelings his parents held on to would also be true.He started having nightmares. It was a dream of being stabbed in the neck by Eris. Alecto, having an eerie feeling, involuntarily touched the area of his neck. Whether the guilt was manifested unconsciously, it was a dream that he\u2019s been having since he was told by his father to hold Eris.Alecto grabbed his throbbing head and raised himself. He asked the royal attendant while the servants helped with his clothes.\u201cIs Lady Mis\u00e9rian still in \u2018The Tower\u2019?\u201d\u201cYes, she still says nothing.\u201d\u201cStupid.\u201dIt has already been several days since the marquis was brought in with charges of opening the Magic Gate and questioned.To be honest, she would be released soon, Eris refused to testify about her father. She seemed naive to believe that she could save her father if she took such a long time.\u201cThe interrogator has asked you to persuade Lady Mis\u00e9rian yourself. Lady Mis\u00e9rian is weak against His Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t help it if the interrogator has asked me to do so.\u201dUnlike before, there was no confidence. This was because Eris confirmed that she no longer loved him.However, the lingering attachment led to Alecto. Maybe like in the past\u2026\u2026 perhaps it was one of her tricks to meet him\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was in her eyes was not excitement or relief, but clear despair and fear. She screamed as if she was facing a monster she should not have seen. She hated him, but never feared him.\u201cGet out before I kill you!\u201dAlecto was perplexed but tried to convince her. His mind quickly went back to calculating. The meeting between Alecto and Eris was always thoroughly calculated. There was an intention implied in every word and action.Obviously, it was to scare him and get a head start.Alecto interpreted Eris\u2019 yelling like that. If it was \u2018Eris\u2019 from the past, the interpretation might not have been wrong.However, when Alecto crumpled his forehead and grabbed Eris\u2019 arm to calm her down, Eris shook wildly to escape his arms.Ah, when he missed her in the meantime, her thin body twisted helplessly to the floor.Her eyelids trembled as she coughed, as if she was about to run out of breath.No, she might die. Die?This child was going to die? Alecto asked blankly. He didn\u2019t even think about that future.\u201cWhy, why are you doing this\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoctor! Call the royal doctor right now!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her\u2026\u201dEven though the interrogator called out to the royal court at the top of his voice, Alecto could not escape the shock. He barely convinced himself to leave.However, Alecto had never imagined that Eris would die so fleetingly, even if she would leave.Was this also an extension of the nightmare?When the breakup was confirmed, he ran out to the empress\u2019 palace after hearing from the royal attendant that she had entered the palace after a long time. This was because in the corner of his mind he was convinced that he would no longer be able to see that face unless it was now.Again, Alecto was born and raised as a crown prince. That meant that as soon as he learned to walk, he had to learn self-defense techniques, learned cesarean as soon as he spoke for the first time, and always had to rationally doubt the intentions of the other person when dealing with someone.\u201cYou\u2026. have changed.\u201dIt was an impulsive choice to spit this out.\u201cYou love me.\u201dI love you.That voice still stood out.Then Eris, who was laughing like a crazy person, finally grabbed him and started an unbelievable story.A nonsensical story that a girl who had dreamed of becoming his crown princess was not rewarded for her efforts, so she made a wish to make herself disappear from this world, it was a vain story created by using this.\u201cYou know\u2026 Then who am I?\u201dHer eyes had changed one day. Was it because her love changed or because the person changed?It was only after hearing that question that Alecto could finally understand. All those mysterious reasons were solved by drawing a single trajectory.\u201cYou\u2019re a different person? Lies. You\u2019re lying. You really went crazy.\u201dAlecto\u2019s hand trembled. He was confident that he knew Eris Mis\u00e9rian better than anyone else.But when he looked back, he didn\u2019t know anything about her. How did Eris laugh? He didn\u2019t remember a single thing about how she spoke or what habits she had.He couldn\u2019t even picture the performance of Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2019. So he couldn\u2019t even tell if the woman was lying.\u2013 I wish you hadn\u2019t been born.All he remembered were the harsh words he said to her. Alecto held her hand again when the woman in front of him stood up and tried to leave. Eris, or the woman who was not Eris, shook her hand.\u201cIf you\u2019re not Eris, where is the child?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s dead. No, she\u2019s gone forever rather than dead. You\u2019ll never see her again.\u201dThe woman forcefully said so. And Alecto instinctively knew that what the woman said was true. He lost strength in his hands.Oh, he had lost something terribly lovely forever. He couldn\u2019t believe that someone who loved him the most in the world had disappeared, so it hurt every time he breathed in as if his lungs were stabbed.Although he didn\u2019t have anything from the beginning, he had no immunity because it was the first time he had lost something he had.\u201cI can\u2019t see her again?\u201dAlecto began to cry. No one comforted him this time.It snowed for several days. My white breath was cold. The servants diligently heated the air in the house, but I opened the window like a tree frog and smelled the winter scent.(PR/N: \u2018tree frog\u2019; a person who behaves erratically.)I had been trying everything to see what were the tears\u2019 the witch spoke about, but they were all in vain. It was neither my tears nor Anakin\u2019s tears. wonder if it was Helena\u2019s tears, but it was unlikely that one person would fulfill two conditions.\u201cYoung lady\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIgnore it. If they come tomorrow, at least pour some water on them.\u201dJason and Hubris kept knocking on the door of the mansion. They came to see me, asking me to meet them, but I sent them all back because it would be tiring just to meet them.As I wrinkled my brow in tiredness, the maid looked at me. She took a deep breath and added.\u201cAt least if they catch a cold, they won\u2019t come while they\u2019re recovering.\u201d\u201cShould I send all the invitations back?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. I don\u2019t plan on staying here for a while.\u201dJason and Hubris were not the only ones who came to see me. Everyone wanted to meet me. To be exact, they want to see Eris fall, but\u2026That\u2019s why I was intentionally stuck inside the house. If I die, I would be dead, would you like to see such a spectacle?I still slept brokenly and woke up. I thought everything was okay now, but it was still the same. As I couldn\u2019t sleep properly, I lost my appetite and became sensitive.Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t control my anger and nervousness, so I had a few people around me.It was unfair. What did I do so wrong? Would it have been less painful if I called someone else without killing the crown prince? If I hadn\u2019t gone to the imperial palace in the first place\u2026\u2026. The question of if constantly bothered me.What if I called someone else? Alecto was the crown prince of this country. It was also unclear whether the crown prince could be questioned for a crime just because he touched his fiancee.\u2026\u2026Was it fair for me to kill him? If individual retaliation could replace punishment, there would have been no need for laws to be made in the first place.Funny. Alecto, who actually sinned against me, wouldn\u2019t even have these worries.No, it was not. Let\u2019s not think about this.I had definitely sinned too. Even if the person didn\u2019t remember, it was true that I had blood on my hands even if time went by and it didn\u2019t happen.\u2018If I denied it, it would be contradictory for me to resent Alecto.pressed down on my twitching forehead. Let\u2019s not think about it. It was already in the past, and it was irreversible. Although the pain remained like a scar and bothered me, time would solve it all. Time, because all I had left was time.Thinking so, I tried to forget the fact that I had to kill Helena myself.\u2026 The imperial family announced yesterday that it would reinstate the status of the Antebellum family, which was executed for treason during the \u201cGreat Pursuit.\u201dAccording to the results of the re-investigation, which ended not long ago, it was found that the Antebellum family rather dissuaded former Crown Prince Letatio at the time of the \u2018Great Pursuit.\u2019However, now that the Marquis Mis\u00e9rian broke the engagement of Lady Mis\u00e9rian on charges of treason, speculation was coming out that the imperial family\u2019s unusual reinstatement is to promote Helena Antebellum, who was the crown prince\u2019s favourite, as the new crown princess.Reading the newspaper brought by the chief servant briefly contained the news that Helena\u2019s status was reinstated. As suspected in the article, the crown prince couldn\u2019t be married to a commoner, so it must be prepared in advance.It was true that they were falsely accused, so there was no problem with being reinstated.The marquis had been locked up in the room for the past few days and drank alcohol. Sometimes he went out and met people then came back. I didn\u2019t know if it was going well, but he always came back with a stiff face.I might be able to play with the marquis that had fallen down, but he must not want my help. No, maybe he wanted his money.It was honor and power that Marquis Mis\u00e9rian was deprived of, not money. Of course, half of the family\u2019s assets were seized, but the Mis\u00e9rian family had somuch wealth that it was comparable to the imperial family.Perhaps even if the marquis played and ate for the rest of his life from now on, he would have enough property left to pass on to Eris.Come to think of it, he was a man of extraordinary business skills. If he was born a merchant who was not interested in power, he would have been happier. It must have been more miserable because it was usually human nature to cover what one does not have.Now that Helena had become a noble again, it was a long way to get married. According to the scheduled narrative, I had to hide in Helena\u2019s honeymoon room on the day of her wedding, so time was flying.While thinking about what to do, I thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to look for an \u2018unread world\u2019.Come to think of it, while reading the novel, Eris\u2019 mother never appeared.There was no way that the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian gave birth to Eris, so she definitely existed. Of course, I was busy dating, but I couldn\u2019t even unravel the story of the villain\u2019s family relationship, so I suddenly became curious.What kind of person was Eris\u2019 mother? Was she arrogant or sweet?Would she look like Eris? Or wouldn\u2019t she look like her? Until what age did she stay with Eris? Maybe she died immediately after giving birth to her?I found a maid who was always by my side to solve that curiosity. When asked what kind of person hermother was, she swallowed her breath for a moment She hesitated for a long time, looked around for a moment, and soon whispered with her mouth in my ear.\u201cBehind the master\u2019s study, there\u2019s another room.\u201dIt was an unexpected answer. As far as I knew, the library of the Mis\u00e9rian family was located at the end of the mansion, so there would be no more rooms\u2026.. She blinked, grabbed my hand and spoke eagerly.\u201cYou can\u2019t get caught.\u201d\u2026.To that extent? I had an ominous feeling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Emma addressed Eris\u2019 father as \u2018Master, and Eris\u2019 mother as Owner.In the next chapter the perspective changes from Emma\u2019s mother to Emma because at that time, Emma\u2019s grown-up when Eris was born.After dinner, I looked around and stepped into the study. The room, located at the end of the aisle on the first floor, was completely different from the family\u2019s study I went to when studying writing.Just in time, the marquis was away today as well,When I turned the door knob of the study, there was a rattling sound, but it did not move. Looking at the tightly locked doorknob, 1 pondered for a moment Should I ask to have it opened? However, it bothered me that the maid whispered that I should not be caught.Most of the attendants of this mansion were not mine, but the marquis\u2019. If caught, there was a high possibility that they would stop me or confess it to him.Even if I heard a sound later, I should go in and find out what he was hiding. I called Anakin a little.\u201cAnakin, I have to go over there. Don\u2019t cut the whole thing. It\u2019ll make a sound.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe cut down the doorknob and opened the door according to my command. I called Anakin as entered the room.\u201cKeep watch here. When a servant comes, send him away.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do if someone who is not a servant comes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. There is nothing we can do if the original owner of this room comes. Let him in. You don\u2019t have to scratch it and make crumbs.\u201d (PR/N: an idiom for making things worse/bigger by doing something that shouldn\u2019t be done.)Leaving Anakin, who bowed his head, behind, I took a step into the study. At first glance, it was an ordinary study\u2026\u2026 It was definitely a little small. It felt like a wall was built in one room to divide it into two.I approached the bookshelf, Tooked around and swept across.The family tree of the Mis\u00e9rian family was placed among them, so I picked it up. I read it while flipping through.I didn\u2019t know the name of the marquis or the name of Eris mother, so I had to hope that Eris would be written on the family tree. And almost at the end of the page, Eris\u2019 name came out.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe names of the two were written above Eris\u2019 names. Carnival Axel, Quies Mis\u00e9rian. It was unlikely that the woman\u2019s name would be \u2018Carnival Axel\u2019. Then it means that Eris\u2019 mother was \u2018Quies Mis\u00e9rian\u2026 Did that mean the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian was a live-in son in-law?When I turned the book over to the end, a letter was stuck in it. I opened the letter and hesitantly looked through the contents.\u2026\u2026She\u2019s not interested in the family business, so I\u2019m going to find a man who can continue the family business instead of her. I can find a partner from another powerful family, but he can\u2019t ignore her just because she doesn\u2019t do anything. It would be nice if could choose him as an ambitious and meticulous man from a fallen noble family\u2026..When I finished reading the letter, I noticed a book with exceptionally lesser dust. When I pulled the book slightly, the bookshelf opened with a click. Something white was shining beyond another cleverly hidden room.I went inside as if possessed and looked. It was\u2026 a coffin. Like a scene from Snow White, a woman with black hair was asleep in the coffin.Without having to read her name engraved on the side of the coffin, I could recognize who she was at a glance. Because she resembled Eris that much.When I took my eyes off the coffin containing the body and looked around the room, it was full of things that looked like Quies Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s items.It felt as if he had moved everything related to her into this place. Then I heard someone\u2019s urgent footsteps.My body was roughly turned. I teased the marquis a lot, but I\u2019ve never seen his face so angry. The marquis whose face was red and trembling, soon raised his hand and grabbed me by the wrist.\u201cYou\u2026 disgusting. You know that, right?\u201dCatching my trembling arms, he pushed me out of the room. As the marquis tried to catch me again, Anakin, who approached, put the sword at the marquis\u2019 neck.\u201cLet go. She is not one to be treated recklessly.\u201d\u201cHow dare you\u2026\u2026 You don\u2019t know your place and you shouldn\u2019t talk to me!\u201dAnakin silently brought the sword closer to the marquis neck. Blood began to fall from the marquis\u2019 neck. Only then did the marquis let go of my shoulders without saying a word as if he had calculated that he could not win.I shook off my shoulders as if something dirty was on me and faced the marquis next to Anakin. Anakin still lifted up the sword.I spoke quietly to the marquis.\u201cIf you answer my question, I\u2019ll shut up and forget about it.\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m threatening you right now. I don\u2019t think killing you here would make any difference.\u201dBlood began to pool under the marquis\u2019 feet.\u201cWhy did you have the body of Quies Mis\u00e9rian stuffed?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean stuffed? Watch your mouth\u2026\u2026.! just did what she wanted.\u201d\u201cShe wanted it?\u201d\u201cYeah. She\u2026.. wanted to die beautifully.\u201dThe marquis swallowed a painful groan once and added the words.\u201cI called it postpartum depression. But\u2026.. She originally had no lingering feelings about this world. Same for me, our daughter also wasn\u2019t good enough to catch her interest.\u201dAfter saying those words, the marquis closed his mouth and looked at us. His eyes were telling me if I wanted to kill him, to kill him. However, despair was deeply cast on his determination. Somehow, my enthusiasm died down and I asked Anakin to pull down the sword.We turned our backs to each other without saying a word. I was in Eris\u2019 room, and he was\u2026\u2026 he headed to the room where Quies Mis\u00e9rian was lying.When I returned to the room, the maid was waiting for me inside, restless. She looked at my face and immediately collapsed as if her legs had no strength.\u201cDo you know how nervous I was when the Marquis came?\u201d\u201cSorry. I made you worry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You don\u2019t have to apologize to me, lady.\u201dI sat on the bed and looked down at the maid and asked.\u201cYou said my mother died shortly after I was born, right?\u201d\u201cThe madam died by the time you were being breastfed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did she get sick?\u201dThe maid stuttered for a moment and said,\u201cProbably, yes. She was originally weak, but I heard she got worse after giving birth.\u201dThen why did the marquis say that? The marquis described Quies Mis\u00e9rian as if she had killed herself. The maid blinked slowly and added quietly.\u201cBut even if you brought the master\u2019s best physician, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to cure an incurable disease. She didn\u2019t have the will to get better.\u201d\u201cMy father said my mother had postpartum depression.\u201d\u201cPostpartum depression? Well\u2026 My mother, who had been watching the owner since she was young, said, she was consistent until the day she died.\u201d\u201cThat story\u2026 Can it be more detailed?\u201dShe was obviously hesitant, but then bit her lip. As is always the case with those who hesitate, the story started with \u2018I don\u2019t know the details.\u2019(Note: From this point on, Emma is telling the story from her mother\u2019s perspective.)The owner had been a docile and clumsy child since childhood. Children usually express their opinions through crying and laughter, right?But the owner neither cried nor laughed. That\u2019s why the lady\u2019s grandmother and grandfather were worried a lot. (PR/N: lady\u2019 as in Eris.)Was the child not smart enough\u2026? That was.That was why they appointed a tutor a little earlier than others, but contrary to their worries, they were told that she was rather clever. If she was taught, she understood everything, so even if it was a daughter, they had no other successors, so it was enough to educate her as the head of the family.But the owner wasn\u2019t interested. So they were frustrated and asked the owner herself. What in the world do you want to be? We\u2019ll support you no matter what you say. Do you know what the owner answered?\u2013 Father, I don\u2019t want to be anything. I\u2019m not interested in anything, and I\u2019m just tired of living. Do / have to do anything? Does a girl have to do anything?My mother was across from the lady\u2019s grandfather, so she clearly saw the expression at that time. She said, she never saw such a sad expression in her life. I would have done the same.What parents wouldn\u2019t be sad when their finely raised daughter acts like a person who was going to die right away?The lady\u2019s grandfather and grandmother said that anything would be fine, so they struggled to arouse the interest of the owner. They taught her instruments, raised animals and plants, and even taught her gambling by attaching a handsome and eloquent man.But nothing caught the owner\u2019s attention.Getting married was the last choice. The reason was that if you have a family, give birth to children and raise them, you will have some fun in your life, Someone said that the owner was not interested in animals and plants, but they firmly believed that raising a child was a different thing.Except for the imperial family, this family was the richest in the capital, so naturally hawks came and went until their feet were worn out. However, the grandfather wanted to bring in a live-in son-in-law, saying that a child who did nothing could be bullied if she went to someone else\u2019s house. He also had to take over the Mis\u00e9rian family. (T/N: hawks is used as a metaphor with the noble men trying to get married to Quies Mis\u00e9rian so that they can feed on their wealth)That\u2019s how the marquis was chosen. He said he liked him because he was a man who was sincere and ambitious, but could not fulfill his desire due to his poor and powerless family. The owner\u2019s parents said, they wouldn\u2019t get involved in anything as long as he let the owner do nothing as she did until now.The unfortunate thing was\u2026 the marquis fell in love with the owner. The marquis would have done anything for the owner, his wife, but the owner wasnot happy with anything. Even though she didn\u2019t refuse when he held the owner in his arms\u2026\u2026 that didn\u2019t mean permission. The master didn\u2019t even feel the need to refuse.The despair of the marquis who knew that\u2026\u2026. was incredible. The marquis began to go outside. Drinking and gambling, of course, he even called a prostitute to his house. He was going to show it to the owner.The owner didn\u2019t change her expression even though she knew that the prostitute had taken over the bedroom. She just slept in the rest of the rooms. Because there were a lot of rooms.T/rant: my guess is that Quies might be stranger?Anyways, a detailed information on the new character name!:Quies Mis\u00e9rian: mother of Eris Mis\u00e9rian and the owner of Mis\u00e9rian, she in particular from birth didn\u2019t have interest in anything, no matter what her parents or the husband did for her. Not even the birth of Eris made her change and eventually died after giving birth to her.Meaning of \u201cQuies\u201d: the word Quies is the root word of \u201cQuiescent\u201d which means \u201crest or quiet.\u201dCarnival Axel: Father of Eris Mis\u00e9rian, originally from a weak noble family, he fell in love with Quies Mis\u00e9rian, but sadly his love wasn\u2019t reciprocated, he fell into depression and started to sleep with prostitutes and his obsession with making Eris sit on the highest seat is because, that is the only thing he couldn\u2019t give to Quies, to get her interest in him.Meaning of the name \u201cCarnival\u201d: There isn\u2019t a special \u201cmeaning\u201d to it as such but anyways this is what I gotan instance of merrymaking, feasting, or masquerading.Meaning of \u201cAxel\u201d: Axel is a Scandinavian form of the Hebrew name Absalom. He has the incredible meaning of \u201cmy father is peace,\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The marquis\u2026 Maybe he was looking forward to it. If she had a child, the owner would change. The marquis faithfully cared for the owner. Even Her Majesty would not have enjoyed such luxury.The owner had some morning sickness, and didn\u2019t eat raw vegetables.\u2026. The chef had a hard time because she barely touched the meat and put only a little fish and fruit in her mouth. I went to the market every morning and tried to buy all the fresh fish. Fish was also precious because the capital was inland.The young lady (Eris) who came out after the last month of pregnancy was safely completed\u2026\u2026 She was really pretty. I had never seen such a pretty baby again in my life.But the owner was expressionless even after seeing the lady. It was like she was checking what she had been carrying for 10 months.She breastfed, but she did it just because her breasts were pumping, and she didn\u2019t feel like \u2018feeding her child\u2019 at all.The owner\u2026\u2026The owner said that she had fulfilled her duty because she had a child. At the time, I was a little over half my height now, but I still remember the owner\u2019s expression and way of speaking vividly. Everyone around her tried, but nothing caught her interest.(Note:\u00a0Emma\u2019s grown up now, perspective shifts from her mother to her.)When she heard that, my mother cried like a child. The marquis also made a wish. He prayed, he got angry, he cried, he went crazy. The marquis tried hard, but\u2026\u2026 love didn\u2019t come in return. The owner\u2019s last will was to preserve herself permanently.No one knew why the owner left such a will.\u2026 The marquis was very distressed. However, soon after, according to the owner\u2019s will, magic engineers were called in to preserve the body and store it in a coffin. And he drove all the things that reminded him of the owner behind his study.He locked everything in there.Now I understand why the marquis said. \u2018You will be happy if you sit in the best seat.\u2019 I wondered where that belief came from, he might have become obsessed because it was the only thing he couldn\u2019t do for Quies Mis\u00e9rian.The same was true for believing that it was postpartum depression. From beginning to end, he didn\u2019t want to believe that she wasn\u2019t interested in him at all. Anyway, why did she ask to preserve herself permanently? Was there a secret hidden in that body?It was a night full of thoughts.* * *It was the beginning of spring. In the Imperial Palace, the marriage of the crown prince and Helena was officially announced.The reason for the marriage, not engagement, was that they were not young, and this time, they showed their desire to thoroughly prevent an unexpected \u2018accident\u2019.Of course, it was not that there was no backlash. In particular, the nobles, who had still remained, stood up on the grounds that Helena had learned nothing to become empress. But the rumors that I was crazy were almost certain, and there was no substitute for me so it was dismissed.The imperial family seemed to be introducing Helena by inviting the nobles every day to break through such suspicions.I taught her for a while, and now the backlash gradually subsided because a professional teacher was really sticking to her and educating her.The marquis began to stir me up as soon as the marriage was announced, but I was ignoring it because there was a proper time for everything. The marquis couldn\u2019t even enter the palace, so he would have no choice but to wait for me whether he liked it or not.There was also a request from the empress to help with the wedding. Of course, that may not be the real purpose, but I was dumbfounded and just ignored it.She had no shame. Why would you want me to help you with that? If the slang for hair growing on your conscience was true, her conscience would have been full.(PR/N: \u2018\uc591\uc2ec\uc5d0 \ud138\ub0ac\ub2e4\u2019 means \u2018what you\u2019re doing is very shameless\u2019 as in iIf you don\u2019t have a conscience, you can\u2019t feel shame\u2019.)However, I thought I wanted to see Helena get married. It must be beautiful.That\u2019s how it was described in the novel.I had certainly believed Helena would love Alecto. But now that their marriage was getting closer, I kept thinking about what Helena told me.If I had asked her back then if she loved Alecto, and if she were frustrated and said she didn\u2019t like that question, would something have changed?\u2026\u2026It wouldn\u2019t have changed. I would have said she still had to get married though. That was the planned narrative. Only then\u2026 I could go back.I took out the hidden knife and smoothed it. I had to stab her. But\u2026 could I really stab her? It was so painful even after killing the crown prince. Kill her, and I\u2026\u2026. could I live as if nothing had happened even if I went back to my world?No! I pulled my hair out.No. That would be running away. Knowing that Helena would be revived by Hubris, I dared to weigh that once I died, it would be the price for her life. I had decided to die anyway, but it was abominable.I think I wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it.It was clear that killing the innocent would really drive me crazy. I was going to have nightmares about her and cry for the rest of my life.\u2026. The sin would never be washed away.Let\u2019s run away.One morning, I suddenly thought of that. Helena shouldn\u2019t die. Even though she had no reason to die, I couldn\u2019t use her as a tool only for my death.I only thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if she died when I didn\u2019t know Helena. Because she was just the main character from the book to me.However, after I met Helena and talked to her, I couldn\u2019t get rid of the idea that she wasn\u2019t that type of person.\u2013 Learning is really fun, right? I never learned it, so I didn\u2019t know.\u2013 It would have been nice if I knew this earlier.\u2026.Unlike the options in the game, the child gave different answers to the same question. It changed moment by moment and grew day by day. The more I met her, the more lovely Helena felt. In the end, I became attached to her.And\u2026\u2026 in fact, it was more terrifying than anything else. I was afraid to die. Until now, I had no problem with dying thanks to the blind belief that this would be a \u2018dream\u2019.I thought that if I died without any reason, I would be able to return to \u2018me\u2019. Death here was never death\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Because in all the stories I had read, that was usually the case.However, as I spent more time here, my anxiety grew.What if that was not it? What if the witch lied to me? I killed Helena and was executed\u2026\u2026 What if I couldn\u2019t wake up again? I couldn\u2019t breathe.I had no regrets about dying because I knew I would wake up again. The swamp of self-contradiction dragged me down from time to time.I knew it was cowardly. I also knew that I was reversing the commitment to Anakin, no, to myself, saying not to escape. But I couldn\u2019t stand it.My family passed by in front of my eyes. Everything I left in my world was asking me. Are you sure you don\u2019t have to come back? Can you live someone else\u2019s life with someone else\u2019s face? Are you confident that you won\u2019t regret it if you don\u2019t see it again?Ah, I remembered my mom\u2019s face. I also heard my mother\u2019s voice being disappointed, asking how I never contacted her.I wanted to scream. No, I didn\u2019t know if maybe I had buried my face in a pillow and screamed. Because I was half out of my mind and rolling on the bed tearing my hair off.Mom, look at me. Mom, your daughter is trying like this. I am so tired. I miss my mom\u2026\u2026 I really miss you!It was too far to go home\u2026\u2026. I couldn\u2019t go any further because it was so far away.I gasped for a long time. My curled body gradually stretched out. Anakin. When I called his name, he came up to me. I didn\u2019t say anything, but he covered my eyes without saying anything.I could cry for a moment under his hard hands. When I finally stopped crying, I quietly ordered him.\u201cPack up, Anakin.\u201dAnakin silently packed my luggage at my words without even asking the common question of where he was going. He shoved any clothes into my luggage and collected gold at random. Anakin jumped out of the window first and then caught me falling.The magic train was stopped after being suspected of stability, so I had to ride a horse or carriage. Anakin secretly bought a horseman through Cynthia.\u201cAre you Anakin?\u201d I\u2019ve been waiting.\u201dThe horseman guided us straight behind the carriage without asking anything. There were so many large boxes, among them, I hid myself in an empty box. It was reasonable for me to enter. I was smaller in size, but more noticeable in appearance than Anakin.\u201cPlease bear with me even if it\u2019s a little uncomfortable. I\u2019ll open it for you when I pass the watergate.\u201d\u201cWhat are the rest of the boxes? It smells bad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s trash.\u2026\u2026 The capital is so dense that there is no landfill. That\u2019s why we regularly send trash and dirt to areas outside the capital.\u201dEverywhere, the water supply was expensive. I went into the box without saying a word. Although the inside of the box was uncomfortable and smelled bad, humans were adaptable creatures, so their noses were paralyzed and bearable.The rattling wagon stopped for a moment as if it stood at a gate. The guard asked formal questions to the horseman as usual.\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The odour trapped in the box spread.\u201cDo I have to open another one? It must smell bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s done.\u201dI held back my pounding heart until the horseman closed the box and drove the wagon again. I couldn\u2019t even tell how much time had passed because I couldn\u2019t see outside and I didn\u2019t even have a wristwatch.The wagon gradually slowed down and soon stopped completely. After the coachman pulled me out, he hurriedly unlocked the link between the wagon and the horse.\u201cThat\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019ll give you a horse, so you two have to go on your own from here.\u201dWe moved our luggage onto the horse and ran nonstop to another nearby village.Under the flurry of light, two running shadows fluttered.As soon as we left the capital, chasers immediately caught up. Maybe the marquis sent them. Anakin measured the number and asked if he should kill them, saying that there were about two.\u201cNo, not yet. Since it is near the capital now, if we kill them, the Marquis, who will find it strange that no contact has been made, will send new chasers.\u201dIf we were going to kill them, we had to kill them as far away as possible. So he would misunderstand that the delay in contact was because of the far distance.Anyway, it would be all useless if we got caught before that so we had to disguise ourselves.\u00a0 And in order to confuse them as much as possible, we tried to change our appearance by changing clothes every time we visited a village.Sometimes we were siblings, sometimes newlyweds, and sometimes Anakin dressed as a woman and I dressed as a man.Anakin looked pretty good dressing up as a woman.It wasn\u2019t because he looked particularly pretty, but because he was tall, his original features were faint, so there was no incompatibility in whatever he wore.Anakin accepted however I decorated him, so it was very fun because it seemed like playing with a large doll.But we couldn\u2019t ignore the height difference between the two of us, so to overcome it as much as possible, I pretended to be Anakin\u2019s younger brother instead of wearing a clumsy mustache.The big woman and the small man sometimes caught the attention of others, but the chasers did not even suspect and thought we would hide ourselves so thoroughly.I deliberately wandered around the cheap inns. This was because the chasers judged that the picky marquis\u2019s young lady would be in a good accommodation, so they searched thoroughly in the best accommodation.The bed creaked, and the curtains smelled of dust. In addition, compared to what I ate at the marquis, the meal was terrible.But it was still good. I didn\u2019t have to imitate Eris. Now, Eris no longer had to think about what to say, what facial expressions to have and how to act.Rather, I had to try not to imitate Eris as much as possible, so gradually I was getting my way of speaking and thinking back. I felt like I was doing rehabilitation training.We discussed again and again about what to do next in our spare time. At first, I taught writing, and then Anakin asked to become a hunter and make money.The writing might be different from the empire, but\u2026\u2026 I felt groundless confidence that I would learn soon.Just in case I couldn\u2019t learn to write and Anakin wasn\u2019t good at hunting, there was also a plan that if Anakin knitted, I would sell it.No, I thought it would not be bad to work in the field or help with the inn for a while. Anakin was more physical and versatile than me, and I also had no part-time job when I was in Korea.That way, when seed money was collected, I could buy an instrument and get paid after I went out on the street and played it. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to achieve my dreams here that I couldn\u2019t achieve in Korea.I would watch the stars at night. Anakin said he could tell me all the constellations that appear in all four seasons. During the day, I wanted to learn this world anew under the sun.Since I decided to stay, everything looked different. It would definitely be fun. Maybe it would be a life with nothing more to ask for.We headed north without hesitation. What existed in the north was the so-called \u2018land of barbarians\u2019, and it was said that it was still a country that strongly believed in witches and magic.It was also a country that signed a nonaggression treaty after a long war with the empire, so if we crossed the border, it would have been impossible for the marquis to chase us, no matter how much he tried.Since it was a country that believed in witches, I thought I should sell Medea\u2019s name if I could. The contract to send me back had been broken, so I couldn\u2019t ask her for help anymore.\u2026.She was not going to kill me for selling her name. I was not afraid at all if a witch would harm me, but I was afraid that Anakin would be disappointed in me.What on earth do you think about running away with me? I couldn\u2019t promise you anything now, but there would be no more \u2018mainstream\u2019 in our future. Why did you agree and accept it casually?Watching Anakin\u2019s profile as he disposed of the chaser\u2019s body, I hoped Anakin would convince me of why he was so blind.Yeah, I hoped it was a very common and clich\u00e9 reason. You eventually fell in love with me. You wanted to hold my hand, and you wanted to run away forever, it was not just me\u2026\u2026 I dared to ask you to say so.I wonder, how far have I strayed from the story? So far, I know the ending and development of this story, so I tried not to deviate too much from it. Yes, that was why I killed the crown prince and turned back time.Knowing the future had more advantages than I thought, and I now had to give up all of them. This was because I had never read about what happened to \u2018Eris Mis\u00e9rian,\u2019 which was out of the story.Little by little the further away from the capital city I got, the more the law of causality was pulling me. The wheel of the wagon suddenly broke, or the horse untied the rope and ran away.Even in disguise, there was a time when we caught a person who tried to report us. After burning the correspondence while thinking about killing him, we threatened to kill all of his family and released him.I knew that there would be no future troubles only if we killed him, but I didn\u2019t want to see blood.The village near the border, which we arrived at after many twists and turns, was as quiet as all rural villages.Since it was like an alpine area, it was not suitable to do agriculture, so the entire village seemed to make money by offering people across the border a place to sleep and feeding them.Perhaps because it was winter, the border door was closed by a short margin.I tried to convince him with a bribe, but it quickly got dark, and because the next village was a little far away, it was said that there were many cases where people often died after not being able to withstand the drop in temperatures and the wild animals while crossing the hill at night.I didn\u2019t want to be suspected if I kept insisting to the person shaking his head, saying that he hated removing corpses during this winter. As soon as the sun rose tomorrow, we decided to cross the border and get accommodation.We killed the chaser and had to wake up early in the morning, but I didn\u2019t want to spend the last day at a cheap inn. In order to make a move early tomorrow, I hoped it was a place where the bed didn\u2019t smell like dust and there were less creaking sounds.In the end, the price was much higher than the usual accommodation, but I took a room at a moderately neat and well-equipped inn and unpacked.I looked around the quiet village and entered a nearby store. It was embarrassingly shabby and old compared to the capital\u2019s dessert store, Launte, but it was also a perfect place for travelers who had to hurry to cross the border to relax their feet for a while.When I ordered drinks and refreshments to eat briefly and watched people outside the window, I remembered when I went to see Metheus.There were twists and turns, but I had a lot of fun until Jason intervened.We watched a play together with a lot of food in our hands.\u2026.Come to think of it, Anakin said he was curious about me. In response, I brought up first \u2018my story\u2019 and then lastly, \u2018my family story\u2019, to be exact.Oh, and I think I told him once more about my past when we lived together in a separate house.It wasn\u2019t a big deal. When people had nothing to talk about, they would usually bring up their school days. In fact, Anakin never went to school, so he wouldn\u2019t have understood half of my story.In fact, that was why I didn\u2019t really want to talk to Anakin about what kind of life I had lived.This was because it was not a pleasant life for others to hear, and there were many things that were difficult for Anakin to imagine because the world in which he lived was literally different.Rather than a meaningless past, I wanted to talk about the present we were in together and the future where we wanted to be together. If I was to tell him about myself, I wanted to show myself who changed because of him rather than the me in Korea he didn\u2019t know.After I said that, I bit my lip. It was the same as trying to wrap it up somehow. Let\u2019s be honest. I was afraid that Anakin would be disappointed in me.My normal face, not the beautiful Eris. I pretended to be strong, but in reality, my personality was full of inferiority. I was afraid that Anakin, who had been my support so far, would no longer want me to be his master, because I was afraid that the past times that I had been miserable rather than wealthy like Eris would be revealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 78: We Would Be Happy\u201cAnakin, do you have anything you want to do other than being a wandering knight?\u201dIf you had no regrets in this world, could you follow me?The selfish wind suddenly lifted its head.No, let\u2019s stop thinking about this. I decided to stay here. I bit my lip, and Anakin, who was staring at the drink in front of me, lifted his head and shook it slowly.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have any other choice. However, even if I had a choice, nothing would have changed.\u201dAnakin took a sip of the drink in front of him and swallowed it.\u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to even have a name that everyone has. I could have named myself like Kynthia if I wanted to.\u201dDo\u2026. not feel the need.(TL/N: she purposely paused in between, that word is sinking in her mind.)Somehow Anakin looked a lot like Eris\u2019 mother, Quies Mis\u00e9rian. Wanting nothing, not interested in anything.Maybe that was why the two people in the story got closer. It was said that Eris was suffering from her mother\u2019s absence and felt lonely.He was so blank because he was a supporting role for Eris? If he was in Helena\u2019s supporting roles, would the writer have set him in more detail than he was now?When I kept my mouth shut with one thought or another, Anakin soon put his glass down and smiled a little.Light eyes stared straight at me.I wanted to kiss the corner of his faintly rising mouth. Even if we were not in the ballroom, would you accept me?\u201c\u2026I think it was a good thing I didn\u2019t name myself. I like the name my master gave me.\u201dIf we hadn\u2019t met here\u2026\u2026 Just like any other love, I was introduced to you in Korea, at school, and in a very ordinary way\u2026\u2026 If we met like that, would we still fall in love?The answer came out easier than I thought. You were still wearing the necklace I gave you.No matter how much life was a series of regrets, we all lived in pain by holding onto the assumption of what-ifs, but it seemed to have gotten particularly serious when I entered this novel.I guess not returning to the dorm right after leaving the store was the source of all troubles. Would it have been different if I hadn\u2019t asked to walk for a while because the streets at night were so pretty?No, when I think about it now, the damn causality must have worked. Otherwise, I couldn\u2019t have known that I would suddenly hear about Helena from a flower shop where I jokingly stopped by, asking Anakin to buy me a flower.No, no. It was all an excuse. Actually, I just wanted to go back. When the sun rose and the gates opened, it was ridiculous to say that I had changed my mind at the very threshold of crossing the line. But I couldn\u2019t help it.I was taught to push myself. Because there was no one to replace me. I even said with my own mouth that I didn\u2019t need her feelings. Honestly, I felt complacent because it was a good position to be in.(PR/N: \u2018her\u2019 as in Helena.)It was a position called crown princess, who would become the Empress later. Marrying a childhood friend, a handsome prince in a fairy tale, was not a bad opportunity in her life as a maid.It came true in the novel I read anyway. I concluded at my disposal that I was only helping her.So I never really asked her. Was it okay for her to marry the prince?\u00a0 No, it wasn\u2019t good enough. Did she want to marry him?It kept bothering me that I haven\u2019t heard the answer. No, maybe that crying face caught my heart.No, no\u2026. I had already seen her cry. At Eris\u2019s Coming of Age ceremony, I even told Helena, who was squeezing her head with a wet face over something that was not her fault, that it was okay to cry.Come to think of it, she was still young.I was just about to attend college. If I had heard that a person of that age was getting married in Korea, I would have probably fainted.I knew this was crazy.It was also absurd to apply Korean standards to this world. If someone saw me, they might think that I was being noisy belatedly.However, if I went back to Helena and asked her intention, and if she said no\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026I would have to break her marriage.I couldn\u2019t make her unhappy even if it was for me.I slowly lowered my hand while smelling the scent of wrapped flowers. I put the back of my hand that wasn\u2019t holding a flower to my forehead, laughed and asked Anakin in vain while picking up a stalk.\u201cI\u2019m sure we could have lived happily ever after. Right?\u201dDespite my sudden question, Anakin did not ask back why. He just looked down at me and nodded coolly. A faint smile caught his mouth.Oh, it was at that time. It was my favorite appearance. In fact, there was nothing I didn\u2019t like.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure we would have been happy.\u201dFutures that could have been achieved, but have not been achieved, passed by my eyes.I would become a teacher and he would become a hunter, getting by day by day. Making money by knitting and working at an inn\u2026\u2026. The timeline where I would play musical instruments, study constellations, sell Medea\u2019s name, and pretend to be a witch.\u2026\u2026.Someday, there might be a day when I would regret making this decision.But somehow I was convinced that there would be a happier future than the ones I just lost.\u201cWe\u2019ll be happy.\u201dEven if we didn\u2019t run away, we would be happy.***Since there was no need to use my brain by running away, the way back to the capital was naturally faster than when I ran out. Still, it was two days before the wedding because the distance was so far away.The whole capital was noisy preparing for the wedding.Of course, flowers and white cloths were waving on every street, and it was very crowded with each party celebrating the crown prince\u2019s wedding.Yes, the wedding of Helena and the Crown Prince was a major event described by increasing the number of chapters, so it was understandable.The problem was that I couldn\u2019t enter the imperial palace. Since my status as the fiance has disappeared, I was in a position where I could not enter unless the imperial family called me.When it came to sneaking in, the security was tighter than ever.\u00a0 I even thought about using the underground passage, but now that the Marquis had been dismissed from his post, it was in vain.In the original, I didn\u2019t know how Eris entered the palace. Or since it was the wedding day, did she enter in the middle of a hectic time?Anyway, it would be late on the day. No matter how much I thought about it, I was not confident in breaking into the wedding hall and shouting, \u2018This marriage is invalid.\u2019I had no choice but to think of a person\u2019s face while biting my fingernails.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to run away?\u201d\u201cWell, that happened somehow.\u201dWhen I knocked on the familiar wooden door, Medea looked down at me sternly. To be honest, I avoided looking at her because I was the one who was stabbed. Medea, who was looking at me, sighed and soon stepped aside.\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and talk. Come on in.\u201dAs I sat on her couch, savouring the willfully tasteless tea that Medea had brewed, I hesitated and opened my mouth. I explained the situation first. The story of how I escaped, went to the border, and then returned.\u2026\u2026I also talked about why I had no choice but to run away. Because I had to persuade Medea.\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cI want to talk to Helena.\u201d\u201cYou must think of me as a peddler or troubleshooter?\u201dUgh, she was angry. Well, whenever I did something, I was looking for Medea, it couldn\u2019t have looked good from her point of view. Anyway, it was me who was disappointed, so I rolled my eyes and spoke in a voice like an ant\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d\u201cWhatever you ask for.\u201d\u201cYou should be brave. What do you think I\u2019m going to ask you for?\u201dNo, why do you keep talking in circles?I\u2019m running out of time! Honestly, I knew it was my fault and she was upset, but I suddenly got annoyed. I jumped up, looked down at her, and grinded my teeth.\u201cI\u2019m going to handle it. Why are you so talkative?\u201d\u201cEven if I tell you to stay in this world?\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThe absurd question made me laugh automatically.\u201cYou have to ask for a price that fits my condition. Why else would I come to you? I\u2019ll just run into the Imperial Palace pretending to be crazy. And if I stay in this world, do you think I\u2019ll be fine?\u201dKynthia still liked me better. If he had to choose between the two of us, who would he choose?\u201cI\u2019ll definitely mess up your next plan, so take care of it.\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cStill\u2026.. I\u2019m asking for a favour.\u201dMedea looked up at me for a moment and smiled brightly. She reached out and grabbed my neck once. As if to gauge whether it could be broken. But soon she got up and headed to the full-body mirror in the corner.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s meet.\u201dShe asked me to look straight in the mirror and keep imagining the face I wanted to see.I had to feel like I was making eye contact with her. That was easy to say, honestly, it was very difficult for me who was unfamiliar with magic.However, as a result of closing my eyes and trying to concentrate, Helena\u2019s appearance was clearly shining in the mirror when I opened my eyes.Whether she was preparing for marriage or not, she was not dressed as a maid. To Helena, who was embarrassed, I brought up the main topic without talking about this or that.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian! Where in the world have you been\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, say no.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you want to run away, tell me you want to run away.\u201dI looked her in the eye and said just that.I didn\u2019t bring up anything more than that.Anyway, she would know what I was talking about even without stating the subject.\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you run away no matter what I do.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 79: May Your Daydreams of Twilight Be Ever So RadiantThen, her face gradually began to be colored with a subtle smile.She pursed her lips, made eye contact with me and said,\u201cYou know what, Lady Mis\u00e9rian was right. The more I learn, the more I know what I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cNow that I know it, I have something I want to do for the first time. And\u2026 I can do it if I sit here.\u201dHelena straightened her back.The fact that it was me who wanted to run away, not Helena\u2026\u2026 I realized it again.Did I want to run away from her and feel vicarious satisfaction? A bitter smile lingered around my mouth.Helena looked different again. I had hated Helena since I first read the novel. Because it wasn\u2019t my favourite personality. She was indecisive, dull, overly optimistic, nosy and incompetent.There was a truth that I learned only after entering this world and after constantly bumping into her. A person\u2019s personality was the same as two sides, so the pros and cons could be different depending on how someone interpreted it.Helena was not indecisive, but cautious. She was dull, but she sympathised with the joy or sadness of others faster than anyone else. Being overly optimistic meant that one always tried to move forward positively without giving up easily even in difficult situations, and being nosy meant that one was good and interested in their surroundings.And incompetence. Come to think of it, what did ability mean? Being able to read and write? Knowing the etiquette of the imperial palace? Having fashion sense? Or political sense? All of these were abilities that Helena, who was born and lived as a maid, did not need to have.She didn\u2019t learn because she didn\u2019t need to. Even if she tried to take a certification test, learning must precede, or if I disparaged her as incompetent just because she didn\u2019t know, that would have been unfair.Helena Antebellum was\u2026\u2026 She just didn\u2019t have a chance, and now she got it back.The opportunity I had barely earned was in vain, I didn\u2019t deserve to have it.\u201cWill you come to my wedding?\u201dHelena smiled shyly. When I saw that smile, I was rather ashamed of myself running away to the end of the earth.We each had our own work to do. She took the first step, but I couldn\u2019t back down. My shaken mind hardened fast.Even if I didn\u2019t kill her, Helena would become the crown princess. She was a lovable person and she would live in peace in her surroundings, just as she had always been.Alecto would take care of her on his own, even if political opponents might frame her or rebel against what she did.But if I killed Helena, and if Hubris saved her again, people would think that the new crown princess, or the empress, had been blessed by God. And they would believe that those who want to harm the \u2018God-blessed Empress\u2019 were absolute evils.Religion would have a great influence on this country, and miracles would instill strong awareness in people.Then whatever Helena did, it would become difficult to rebel against her politically. If I was going to give her strength, I had better make sure. It was the original story, so it was much safer.The calculator, which had been tapping quickly in my head, stopped. I laughed at myself. Perhaps this was why Helena felt sorry. People usually craved what they didn\u2019t have.\u201cI\u2019ll go. Instead\u2026 I want to meet you alone. People might think it\u2019s strange.\u201dWill you let me in? At my question, Helena smiled brightly and nodded.The day after tomorrow, her wedding will be held.I had to kill her that day for a happy ending that everyone wanted.* * *It was a morning that matched the expression of being truly blessed, with white clouds blooming beautifully in the clean and blue sky.I breathed in the clear and cold air to the fullest. Perhaps Helena and Alecto were going to the temple and being blessed.I chose the right casual clothes and wore a black veil. Anyways, it was my ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, so there was nothing good about standing out.When I was ready to go out, the maid looked at me with worried eyes.\u201cLady\u2026\u201dIf I went out now, I could never come back. Perhaps that was why the usual greeting of going didn\u2019t come out of my mouth easily. It was just a formality anyway, so it was okay if I spat out lies or anything.\u2026.That was probably because she didn\u2019t treat me formally. Emma had always been faithful to me, so I could last a little longer in this strange world.\u201cThank you always.\u201dSo I decided not to lie too. Anakin followed me when I hurried out of the room for fear of lingering feelings.I stopped him with a gesture. In case of an emergency, I thought it would be better to keep Anakin hidden as the secret weapon.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something else you have to do for me. I\u2019ll let you know when the time comes.\u201d\u201cThen take a mirror with you.\u201dI took the mirror and looked at my face for a while.\u00a0 I was sorry to Eris, but now it was time to say goodbye to her as well.Of course, the wedding was not something that could be seen just because one wanted to see it because only the aristocrats, especially the high-ranking aristocrats and the imperial family, could enter and watch it. Therefore, it was a principle to have a street parade on the street for the common people when the crown prince or emperor got married.This was also what the imperial family worked the most on at the wedding. Since there were so many people and it progressed slowly because of people, there were more threats of assassination than ever. According to records, some people must have really died.Nevertheless, the reason why it did not stop was because it was good for recovering public sentiment, and there was no other way to revitalize the stagnant social atmosphere or economy.There were even rumors that the weather would change for the street parade, so that said everything.Perhaps the crown prince or Helena were wearing artifacts just in case. In addition, the knights and magic engineers would be standing guard in each area.Perhaps I stood in the right alley and measured where the guards might be hiding.Each person was excited and had flowers in their hands. It was clear that they would probably throw them as hard as they could when the procession passed.It was said that the magic engineers who were at the forefront of the procession were constantly shooting sparkles through magic tools, so it was a sight that would be eye-catching even if you didn\u2019t see it.I heard cheers from far away. The sound was getting louder and louder, and it seemed like a tsunami was coming.My hands were a little sweaty, so I wiped them off my skirt and caught my breath. Everyone was shouting congratulations. They said that they wanted to live happily ever after, and that they loved each other.Finally, Helena appeared, waving at people and smiling among the pouring light and flowers.Her dazzling silver hair was decorated with polished orange branches, and a sheer veil was hanging at the end. The white empire dress which was delicately embroidered with gold thread, looked very good on her.May your daydreams of twilight be ever so radiant.But why did I keep..\u2026 I didn\u2019t know if I could imagine Eris\u2019 wedding. Eris\u2019 wedding must have been beautiful.Was she blessed like this? With very few exceptions, Eris, who left after being hated by the world\u2026\u2026 Did she only show her sincere smile that day?At that moment, would she have thought that life was really dazzling and that she was lucky to be born?* * *I think I knew why the original Eris chose this day. The imperial palace was simply a mess. When hiding in the back garden of the imperial palace, no one noticed me, unlike usual. No, maybe the causality was helping me.Eris said she hid in a \u2018new room\u2019. Where was the new room in this imperial palace? It wouldn\u2019t be the crown prince\u2019s existing bedroom. He wouldn\u2019t have been given a new room separate from the palace.It must have been inside the Imperial Palace, but the building called the Imperial Palace was also quite large.I couldn\u2019t ask anyone, so I had to guess it well with my gut. If I could, I thought about just opening the door in each room and checking it.Since all the people in the palace were transferred and busy preparing for the wedding and reception that followed, only the minimum number of people remained.The room with a small door was out of the list. The crown prince and his wife slept well in the bedroom, but of course it would be a large bedroom. Also out of the list if it was near the stairs too. It was a newlywed bedroom, but was it in a place where people came and went? In the same sense, the first floor was also out.After erasing it roughly, there were actually few bedrooms to check.I thought they would not have sprinkled roses on the bed, but even though there were no roses, the flowers and branches of the linden tree were beautifully decorated on the bed. There was nowhere else to sit, so I sat on the bed and waited for Helena.At this rate, it was clear that it would be a setback if the crown prince came in first, but for now, I decided not to believe in the novel and hide. The knife hidden in my arms felt heavy. When Helena comes in\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll have to kill Helena with that knife.What if she resisted? Would I be able to win by a difference in power? What if she screamed and ran away as soon as she saw the knife? It might be faster for the people who came running after hearing her scream to catch me than for me to catch her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 80: Helenas\u2019s WorldIt was me who had never practised dissecting fish or frogs, let alone people. I couldn\u2019t even tell how hard I had to stab. As time went by, my stomach hurt because of the tension.Could it be that I found the wrong room? I was thinking about whether I should get up now and go to another room.The door opened, and Helena in a white gown entered the room and met my eyes. Without a sign of surprise, she said something to the attendant behind her door, and she took the teapot and teacup herself.When the door closed, she asked me in a small voice.\u201cDo you want a cup of tea?\u201dWhen I looked at the door, Helena smiled and reassured me.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No one will come for a while.\u201dShe was so calm,\u00a0 I felt uncomfortable because she was so calm. Something was out of the ordinary. Come to think of it, why wasn\u2019t Helena surprised when she saw my reflection in the mirror?\u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us.\u201dHelena\u2019s purple eyes\u2026\u2026 stood out.* * *Helena Antebellum was a child who could not doubt anyone. Although she was slow-tempered, she always tended to ignore\u00a0 her intuition, saying it was just a feeling.Helena believed that all humans were good inside, and thought it was bad to doubt others carelessly.One might wander around, but if she showed consistent trust and affection, they would eventually return to their good nature. So she didn\u2019t notice that Eris Mis\u00e9rian had changed somehow. Growth was always like that.So when she found out that \u2018Eris\u2019 wasn\u2019t herself, she was quite indifferent to her.\u2026 No, she was actually very disillusioned.Because of the call, she was on her way to the empress. She saw Eris and Alecto talking from afar. She was worried about whether they were fighting, so she walked faster. Eris grabbed Alecto\u2019s two cheeks and brought his face close.Helena hid herself behind the pillar without realizing it. This was because there was no way to avoid the embarrassment if they made eye contact.But she couldn\u2019t hear a kiss. Doubtfully, Helena slightly raised her head again. Eris quietly began to talk.When her voice rose, she almost ran out to stop them, but somehow she had a very strong feeling that she shouldn\u2019t be caught.Some gravity was holding her ankle and holding her right behind the pillar.So that she couldn\u2019t move a single step.So Helena had no choice but to listen.\u201cHey, guess who I am.\u201dHelena, who hid herself behind the pillar, stopped breathing. She could have suspected it was a lie, but somehow the bell in her head rang loudly and shouted that it was true.Her heart sank and she felt dizzy. She couldn\u2019t believe that the one she had met so far wasn\u2019t Eris.Helena dared to think she knew her well. Now she realized that it was terrible arrogance.\u201cIf you\u2019re not Eris, where is the child?\u201d\u201cShe is dead. No, she\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\u2013 I hate you. I wish people like you would die.One day, the sight of her crying and staring at her penetrated Helena\u2019s heart.\u2013 Without you, I wouldn\u2019t have been so hated.Even after the woman in the form of Eris disappeared, Helena could not move her feet for a long time.Why didn\u2019t she notice? Where did she change from? She was going through her memory, nailed to the spot.Helena had a lot of affection. Some even expressed that it was too much. She used to give her heart easily in such a short time, so the day would come when she would get hurt.But contrary to what they thought, she was not hurt. Rather, it was the people around her who were hurt.Helena was just warm-hearted, but they used to misunderstand it. To this dazzling person, they were so flattered that she was a special being and that she was different from others. Furthermore, no matter what the beginning was, in the end, everyone wanted Helena to receive as much love as they had given her.Funny, even though she had never asked for love. It didn\u2019t take long for the illusion to break. Because she could tell just by looking at the way others talked and looked at her.She thought it was special.When the full illusion was broken, people accused Helena of holding and shaking their hearts. She was ashamed. They turned their arrows to Helena because they wanted to hide their shame. It was a bad thing for her to make them misunderstand. She shouldn\u2019t have given them a chance.In fact, Helena was not resentful or upset even though it was an argument that was tantamount to nothing. She didn\u2019t even regret that she cared for them.She was just sorry that they didn\u2019t feel the same way. Looking at Helena, those who criticised Helena used to feel ashamed. It had always been like that.For her, Alecto and Jason were special beings as \u2018friends\u2019. At least they didn\u2019t blame her. Helena wanted to keep this relationship as long as possible. And there was only one person who didn\u2019t like it.\u2013 His Highness is so kind to you. Do you think you\u2019re a noble? Or do you dare to raise your status as the subject of a traitor\u2019s family?People could hate someone this much. Since Helena\u2019s nature was far from hatred, Helena realized that hatred could make people more sick than expected only after seeing Eris. But somehow Helena didn\u2019t hate Eris.Rather, she thought that consistent Eris was better than people who always changed their minds. She even had a strange trust that even if everyone betrayed her, they wouldn\u2019t do as much as Eris.Standing in front of Eris, at least Helena didn\u2019t have to worry about whether she had created an \u2018illusion\u2019.She wouldn\u2019t change as much as she did. She would always\u2026..She never thought Alecto liked her. First of all, they had a huge difference in status and they had been with each other since childhood.(TL/N: she is implying that their relationship was more like \u2018siblings\u2019.)Others thought that Alecto treated Helena in a special way, but they only thought it was special treatment as a \u2018close friend\u2019 because he had only a few people to share his heart with.On the night Alecto confessed to her, the moon was bigger than ever, and the back garden shone as white as the day.She remembered Alecto\u2019s trembling voice.The face, which was carefully and politely asking for her intention, was slightly red with tension and excitement.Only then did Helena realize that Alecto really liked her. Because it was a familiar face. When Eris saw Alecto, she always used to look like that.Helena liked Alecto too. However, when asked if she was confident in liking him as a lover, she could not answer.Having been together for so long, Alecto had been a part of Helena\u2019s life. She couldn\u2019t imagine that they wouldn\u2019t be able to meet even if the day came when she got married and left the palace someday.A being who believed that they would be together until the end of their lives. Could she have had that kind of trust because she loved Alecto? Helena was\u2026. she was confused.Eris asked her to try liking Alecto if she had no other favourite person. While she liked Alecto more than anyone else. After having trampled on his childhood, saying they were dating, Eris calmly declared that she was tired of Alecto.She even actively helped put her next to Alecto, perhaps it was not enough to declare it.She held Helena\u2019s hand, taught her, and carefully cared for her. Everyone who knew Lady Mis\u00e9rian would not believe it.\u201cYou can change your mind. You have the right and power to do that.\u201dHelena Antebellum always lived compliant and resigned. Because she had no other way. No matter how rough things were, she laughed, did not tell anything, and pretended not to know even if she knew.The girl who made her feel that more deeply than anyone else was now trying to show her a new path.\u201cIf you\u2019re sad, learn. I\u2019ll help you gain strength by raising your status.\u201dAs Eris said, if you learn and gain strength\u2026\u2026 What would be different?\u201cKeep in mind that once you have power, you can carry out your will whether you take revenge on me or deny your situation.\u201dCould she finally hate or like without getting permission from someone?Learning something was very exhausting, but it was fun. It was interesting when she\u00a0 learned letters, manners and dance from Eris, but when the \u2018teacher\u2019 taught her history, society and politics, she felt like she was opening her eyes completely.So far, Helena\u2019s world had been all about the imperial palace. Sometimes, she would listen to the situation in the capital from Hubris, a new official she was close to, or about adventures from Jason.However, it was just a fragmentary event, so she couldn\u2019t understand why such an event occurred at all.Since she was black eyed and didn\u2019t know how to write, she couldn\u2019t read books or newspapers even if they came into her hands for the first time in a long time. In short, there was no background knowledge.(PR/N: \u2018black eyed\u2019 means an ignorant person who can\u2019t read.)She heard from Hubris that there were many orphans in the capital, but she didn\u2019t know why there were many orphans. She heard that Jason had experience in the guild as a mercenary, but she didn\u2019t know why the mercenary industry was particularly developed in the empire.Due to the Magic War before she was born, the state encouraged mercenary businesses to fight off evil. This mercenary business grew rapidly based on the orphans created by the Magic War, as orphans who did not have a family business could easily do it.However, the mercenary industry was both a light and shadow for orphans, as the survival rate of mercenaries was only 60 percent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some might call it social providence, just as natural as water flowing from the top to the bottom.(PR/N: social providence; principles and laws governing the natural world.)However, Helena thought that those who were left out should also be given a choice. Just as she was given a path other than a maid, they must have a path other than mercenaries.In order for such a path to exist, the approval of a \u2018higher person\u2019 with wealth and power was essential.If she became the crown princess, and even the empress, it could have been enough to achieve it.Helena woke up from her thoughts. Maybe she wasn\u2019t Eris from the time she called her Lady Antebellum without hesitation. She used to use that name reluctantly.It was only misjudgment and arrogance that she thought they could finally be friends.Eventually, Eris hated her until the end. They didn\u2019t have any other future from the beginning. When she realised that, why were tears and laughter coming at the same time?As Helena Antebellum wished, Eris Mis\u00e9rian remained unchanged. She just seemed to have changed because she was a different person. No, it was rather Helena who had changed.Helena looked at herself in the mirror in front of the Empress\u2019 Palace. Her glossy hair was now always neatly arranged. Her facial expressions, tone, and even posture have changed beyond recognition. What she was wearing was not a maid\u2019s uniform, but a neat dress made of high-quality fabric.Spring rain poured down. Strangely enough, it was not outside, but only under the roof, it was pooled under her feet. Would it, perhaps, be for the best? She would never meet her again, and the woman in her body.\u2026.Helena thought, thought and thought, and finally remembered her oath from an early summer day.Even if there was no future for Eris, even if all of this was only a little sympathy for her.Helena Antebellum decided not to run away anymore.* * *One side of my chest sank coldly. Did Helena notice something? I held my breath and looked outside.However, perhaps because it was the honeymoon room, nothing was heard because it was soundproof. I didn\u2019t know if the sound of footsteps or words was not heard at all because there were really no people around or because of the soundproofing.I swallowed my saliva once. I couldn\u2019t show it, so I looked at the teacup silently with no expression. If I made eye contact, I felt like I would get caught. Helena looked at my gaze and followed it to the tea. It was still a warm steamy herbal tea.I wanted to cool down my dry throat, but I was scared that the glass would shake. I blinked for a moment and asked Helena.\u201cWhat about Alecto?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s originally a tradition for the groom to see off the guests until the end. He told me to go to bed first because he won\u2019t be here until dawn.\u201dThen, as she said, there was really time to spare. Only then did I pick up the teacup. I still wet my lips slowly with the warm tea.Helena waited for me silently. What should I say? As long as I entered this palace anyway, I had no intention of escaping alive.Should I say a conventional greeting to congratulate their marriage? But even that was not enough. Because I didn\u2019t really want to bless their marriage. When I couldn\u2019t easily rush the first words, Helena spoke up first.\u201cI heard you went to a far\u2026. away place. Did you enjoy your trip?\u201d\u201cTravelling? It\u2019s okay to say a night escape. It was a night escape.\u201dEven with my sharp tone, Helena only smiled softly. I clicked my tongue when I saw that. People shouldn\u2019t just be soft like that.When I thought of the tenacity that Helena showed when she slapped the maid, I didn\u2019t think she would be swayed by others, but sometimes generosity caused anger.She suddenly turned her head at a bird\u2019s cry, fixed her gaze out the window, and said,\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been out of this capital in my life. Sometimes I went out with permission, but all I could do was always hover around the Imperial Palace.\u201dShe looked back at me and took a sip of tea.\u201cSo I thought I would like to travel if I quit my maid\u2019s job someday. Going far away\u2026\u2026 I wanted to see and experience a completely different world from this capital.\u201d\u201cTravel is not as romantic as you think.\u201dThe empire was on the very good side of security. Even in such an empire, the risk increased right away as it got closer to the border. Therefore, there were many cases where people were robbed or kidnapped and sold for human trafficking if they were not accompanied by an escort with considerable skills.Moreover, if there was a woman with a noticeable appearance like Helena\u2019s\u2026\u2026. There was also a strong possibility of a \u2018human hunter\u2019 being attached, who specialised in human trafficking. She smiled bitterly when she heard me.\u201cI know. It\u2019s a false dream for me.\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut, I wanted to see the sea too.\u201dBoom. Somehow, my heart sank at the words. The humble words of missing the sea filled my lungs. The sea\u2026 I was wondering. I couldn\u2019t breathe. Because I knew that her wish couldn\u2019t be fulfilled.The sea was so far from the empire which never got along with the Genyuin Kingdom, where the sea was.Alecto took Helena to a lake as large as the Dead Sea, but it was only a lake, since it was not the sea, it would not have given the same impression.She couldn\u2019t see the sea until she died. It was not like there were no people in the world who died without seeing the sea once, but why did that sentence make a person sentimental? That was probably because I had seen the sea.The sea under the bright sun, the sea with golden waves, the serene and beautiful night sea\u2026\u2026.Those who had heard the sound of the sea breathing once had no choice but to fall in love with the sea. Because the sea was the origin of human beings, or all living things on Earth, I\u2026\u2026 was it okay to be deprived of the opportunity?For me, did I deserve it?\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian?\u201dThe sound of Helena\u2019s call suddenly awoke me from thoughts. I thought I was quite firm, but why was I going back and forth these days? I already knew the reason.I\u2026 I was going crazy. The wounds left in the soul, whether self-contained or unintentional, festered and left me with a laceration.I couldn\u2019t get weak now. It was already the limit. If I failed again this time, if I woke up in this world again, I might beg the witch to kill me so I didn\u2019t wake up again because it was okay if I couldn\u2019t go back to my world.I repeated to myself. Helena was nothing. She was just a character in a novel. Hubris would save her again. This was all a planned narrative, and it couldn\u2019t be helped\u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026\u2026.\u2014 You really couldn\u2019t help it?A voice rang in my head. It was the voice of Eris. She sat close to my ear and said in a mocking voice.\u2014 Hypocrite. You didn\u2019t even think about looking for another future.It was noisy. I tried to shake off the voice. My stomach started to ache. I had done enough. I gave her a chance. If she wanted to run away, she could have run away. Helena said she would stay.\u2014 You were relieved when she said she\u2019d stay. What were you going to do if she really wanted to run away and there was no solution? Were you going to get married instead of her?\u201cI\u2019ll bring the doctor.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dHelena on the opposite side looked at my face and grabbed me with trembling hands as I tried to stand up. If my arms were searched in an examination, I would get caught with a knife. Then everything would be over.She saw the shaking of my hand and put her hand on it. Even her hands were warm. It was always like that.\u2014 See? You\u2019re just like other people. You only think about using her kindness.Only a ringing sound could be heard clearly even if I covered my ears with both hands. Shut up.What was bad about it? What was bad about doing as much as I could? Are you saying that I should save Helena?\u2014 You\u2019re not going to do anything so why do you feel guilty when you\u2019re justifying everything by saying she\u2019s just a fictional character? You\u2019re such a great person who cares about others, are you going to comfort her?\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026..I\u2019m fine.\u201dIt was a lie. None of it was fine.I had a splitting headache and a stomachache. When I couldn\u2019t stand up easily because my legs weren\u2019t tense, Helena helped me. She laid me on the bed and measured the fever with the back of her hand.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, I think you have a fever.\u201d\u2014 Just be honest with me. The reason why you were able to pledge to kill Helena Antebellum so easily was that you could return to your world without paying for your sins.No. With my death\u2026\u2026.\u2014 You don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to pay for the crime because you\u2019re being executed, do you? You tried to kill yourself over and over again, saying it didn\u2019t matter if you died.Eris\u2019 low, gloomy voice caught my breath. No, this was not the spirit of Eris Mis\u00e9rian. It was just a dirty and disgusting shadow of myself.\u2014 More than the life line which became lighter because you thought carelessly, every breath of Helena Antebellum, who had always done her best, was a hundred times more precious.\u201cLady Miserian\u2026\u2026 Are you crying now\u2026..?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She hurriedly wiped away my tears with both hands, but the tear glands that began to burst once did not know how to subside. I moved my lips with great difficulty.The trembling voice was so breathy and terribly small that Helena had to put her ears close to my lips to listen to me.\u201c\u2026Say it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear you. Please say it one more time.\u201d\u201cI want to live\u2026\u2026 Tell me you want to live.\u201dHelena stood up silently and looked down at me. I grabbed her chest with trembling hands. She didn\u2019t resist.\u201cSay you want to live\u2026\u2026 Please.\u201dBut I knew I couldn\u2019t save her. I had already come too far, so I also knew that what I was saying now was just for my liking.(QC/N: like, saying for the sake of saying it, for her own conscience.)The sin of killing her, who wanted to live, would be condemned even if I spent the rest of my life hating and resenting myself.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian. Do you know what?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI like the season between late spring and early summer, when the whole world turns green. It\u2019s warm\u2026 The sun sets late.\u201dHelena closed her eyes and shook for a moment as if imagining the sight that she liked.\u201cAt that time when the wind isn\u2019t too hot\u2026 no matter where I turn my eyes, it\u2019s just dazzling.\u201dAfter finishing the unknown words, she looked back at me. She stroked my hair as if she were seeing her younger sister after a long time. And then she said,\u201cYou may not remember\u2026\u2026 One summer day I already forgave you. And I vowed that day that I would be happy to understand whatever you do to me in the future.\u201dI thought Helena Antebellum was frustrating and stupid. I felt that it was because of her weakness that she did nothing wrong while being bullied by her Eris over and over again. Because she was ignorant and weak, she was afraid of retaliation and could not think of counterattacking.It was a very arrogant and presumptuous idea.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. \u2018Yes\u2019 you told me this one day.\u201dIf it was me, if I was Helena, I would be pleasantly avenged. I would have shamed her and completely trampled on her in front of everyone so that she could never treat me carelessly again.Oh, I thought if I apologized, I would lose. I believed that revenge was \u2018stronger\u2019 because forgiveness would result in losses.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to return it. It\u2019s okay, Eris. Everything will be fine.\u201d\u201cAh, ah\u2026.! Ah!\u201d\u201cSo do what you want to do.\u201dNow I know. Helena was not holding back because she was weak. Rather, she was able to understand and embrace the pain and fear of weak people because she was stronger than anyone else. A weak wicked person could not survive without being parasitic on her kindness.\u201cAh, ah\u2026. AHHHH! AHHHHHHHH!\u201dOh, Helena. You are so dazzling that you save even low-quality humans like me.I cried and screamed. I couldn\u2019t stand the whole situation without screaming.The dagger in my arms cut through Helena, and a beam of light poured out.\u2013 Murderer.said Eris.I laid Helena on the bed as she was wet with blood. The knife given by the witch made Helena lose her breath without having to stab her several times.No matter how soundproof this place was, even so, someone must have heard it because I screamed like that.\u201cAnything, ah-\u201cThe young maid opened the door and screamed when she saw me.The footsteps of people running gradually grew louder.I agonised for a moment over a dagger in my hand. Should I hide this dagger to hand it over to the witch? But somehow the witch seemed to be able to retrieve this dagger wherever it was.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on! Heuk\u2026..\u201dIf that was the case, I would rather hold it to show that I killed her. The knight pushed in the child who collapsed and stopped breathing when he saw me. I looked at the knight quietly and opened my mouth.\u201cSay it to His Highness. I\u2019m back.\u201d* * *I was locked up in a solitary room where I had already come once before, being held by a knight. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t search separately, perhaps because I was holding the knife that killed Helena in my hand. I still needed the mirror in my pocket.How long had I been waiting, the urgent footsteps rang. In the blink of an eye, the crown prince took the key from the servant and opened the door roughly.\u201cYou dare\u2026 you dare\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf Your Highness had come earlier, she might have been able to live\u2026\u2026. Aren\u2019t you such an irresponsible new groom?\u201dHe raised his hand to slap me on the cheek, clenched his fist and trembled. The crown prince told me in a firm voice barely enduring the urge to kill.\u201cWhy did you kill her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it. Just kill me now.\u201d\u201cWhy did you kill her?\u201dIn the eyes of the crown prince who said such a thing, there was some expectation. Expectations?You still don\u2019t admit that I\u2019m not Eris? I shook my head and laughed in vain.\u201cI told you, Eris will never come back. It wasn\u2019t Eris who killed Helena.\u201dExpectations quickly turned into despair.No, his beloved woman died in the first place, but I didn\u2019t know why he reacted like that. Wasn\u2019t it right to be sad or not be able to hold back more anger?He rubbed his face with a miserable look and looked at me for a long time.It seemed as if he believed that there would be a trace of Eris in me.Funny. I would have been the one in this world who most wanted her soul to remain in Eris\u2019 body. Then everything would have been easier.The crown prince was sad about Eris\u2019 absence, but it was not because he loved her. It was just\u2026 It was close to the remnants of regret and disappointment when the object that was always next to him disappeared. Many people used to mistake possessive desire for love and become unhappy.It didn\u2019t matter that Alecto became unhappy because it was his karma, but it would be a different story if I was also involved in that unhappiness. I told him who never believed.\u201cIf you can\u2019t believe it, you can call the High Priest. The High Priests can see the soul of everyone, right? Even during that old witch hunt, he looked at the soul and distinguished it, so he can distinguish whether I\u2019m lying or not.\u201dSince Hubris noticed at once that I was a stranger, perhaps the same went for other High Priests. No, Hubris would come from the start. He blessed me during the Coming-of-Age Ceremony, and anyway, he was one of the main characters in this novel.To be honest, since I had a record of being disgraceful and mean to Hubris, I wanted him to accuse me of being a witch.The interrogator, who interrogated me last time, stood close to the crown prince staring at me with a fierce face.\u201cWhat should I do? If you allow a little torture, I can make her confess the crime within a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s nonsense.\u201dThe crown prince turned his eyes and stared fiercely at the interrogator and said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you notice that I gave her this room? No matter how much of a criminal she is, if you put a fingertip on her body, who was once a half imperial family, your life will be over.\u201d\u201cG, God, Your Highness, I didn\u2019t think much because I couldn\u2019t wait for the judgement, goodness. Please forgive me.\u201dThe interrogator who chased the crown prince leaving the room stared at me once, but I was not scared at all.Anyway, it was good that there was no torture. I was not confident in enduring the pain. I couldn\u2019t even die after biting my tongue, but there was nothing good about just being sick.Was Anakin doing well? After taking a breath, Anakin naturally came to mind. I missed him, but it was Medea not Anakin who I could communicate with through the mirror in the pocket.If that didn\u2019t happen, I would be able to see Anakin at the execution table and in the crowd as scheduled.Well, it was not \u2018Where\u2019s Wally\u2019\u00a0[1]\u00a0and I had never been talented in finding hidden pictures, so I was going to ask Medea to meet him before I die. But what should I say to that face that will never be seen again?The room was cold\u2026 The problem wasn\u2019t exactly with the room. I huddled up and prayed for the morning sun to rise quickly.I thought I could see Hubris as soon as the day came, but the time was delayed a little because he had to go on a mission to a nearby area.In this novel, it was not for no reason that the only High Priest that appeared was Hubris. This was because the author initially set the setting so that Helena could only meet with Hubris.There were three high priests in the capital, except for the pope, but one of them went on a mission to another country and had not returned for a while, and the last one was elderly and was lying in bed.Since the pope, who was in critical condition, was also refusing to be treated by divine power, everyone said in unison that Hubris would become the next pope as soon as possible.Come to think of it, it seemed that it was possible for Hubris to commit a taboo to save Helena at the end of the novel because he became the pope unofficially.Because the pope was given immunity.It was because he was not in the capital city, so I hadn\u2019t heard from him yet, but if he came to know Helena was dead, he would probably run over without stopping. When Helena was taught by me, she seemed quite close to Hubris when she sometimes talked about him.Hubris came with the crown prince the next afternoon. It had been a while since I saw him, and he lost a little more weight. His decadent charm was overflowing so it was a little scary.***[1] Where\u2019s Wally? is a British series of children\u2019s puzzle books created by English illustrator Martin Handford.

We didn\u2019t know what people were doing, and we became frustrated with each other. Still, I intentionally fixed my eyes on Alecto so as to not show it. Alecto asked Hubris.\u201cAll the High Priests can see the soul of a person. Do you see it the same way?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dThe crown prince looked at me and spoke quietly.\u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9e claims that she is not Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Is what she said true? Or did she eventually go crazy?\u201dHubris looked at me when he said that.For the high priest, he didn\u2019t have to pause at all because the color of my soul was \u2018seen,\u2019 but he looked at me for a long time and smiled.The more time he took, the more anxious I became.No way. No way. I hoped my hunch would be wrong.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter finally opening his mouth, Hubris\u2019 voice was completely submerged. The deep shadow on his face made him look like a stranger. He spoke in a low, gloomy voice.\u201cThe person in front of me is Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cYou crazy bastard! Don\u2019t lie!\u201dI didn\u2019t know it would come out like this because he said he would catch people. No matter how much you had been saying that you were going to save \u2018me\u2019, I didn\u2019t know you would drive me crazy.I, who was on the side of the bed, jumped out and grabbed Hubris by the neck.The crown prince grabbed my waist and pulled me away from Hubris. I tried to get away from the crown prince, but there was a wide gap in power.The crown prince closed my mouth which spat swear words at Hubris with his palm and asked. I put my teeth against his palm, but he didn\u2019t even budge to see if he received many calluses.\u201cCan you swear to God that there is no lie in that word?\u201d\u201cYes, I can swear.\u201dOh, yes. I completely forgot that Hubris had said he loved me. You call this revenge, right?When I glared fiercely at Hubris, he simply lowered his eyes, as if he was treating a young girl from an aristocratic family. My body trembled with betrayal. It couldn\u2019t be like this. It wasn\u2019t like this.\u201cIt may be presumptuous, but for a mad person, treatment should take precedence over punishment. Please have mercy.\u201d\u201cThank you, High Priest. I\u2019ll take your opinion into account.\u201dOn the subject of lying without his mouth salivating, Hubris took another step and gave an opinion to the crown prince.Treatment, that was terrible. If I was unlucky, I would go to the worst situation I have ever thought of. I had cold sweat on my back.The crown prince and Hubris went out, and the door was locked tightly again. I was gritting my teeth in anger, but I heard human footsteps again in the hallway.I thought it was Anakin, so I approached the door without realizing it, but it was not the face I wanted to see.\u201cWhy did you come back? You want to watch me go crazy and mad? Why did you lie even though you knew everything? Are you going to retaliate like this for refusing your heart?\u201d\u201cAt that time, didn\u2019t you answer it yourself, \u2018Lady Mis\u00e9rian? Since I remembered the answer back then, I just answered the same thing.\u201dThe eyes of Hubris who finally met mine were black and dead, and my words stopped spontaneously at the horror. Hubris whispered to me darkly.\u201cFrom the day the lady rejected me, I searched all the materials in the Great Shrine. As I told the lady before, there was no way to get out of this world alive.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve seen literature that says that if a stranger \u2018naturally dies\u2019, then he or she will be reborn as a member of this world.\u201dAs I stepped back terrified, Hubris smiled brightly. I got goosebumps and became distracted.\u201cDid you say that it can\u2019t be accomplished because you\u2019re trapped in my sister\u2019s body in this life? Then I will gladly wait for the next life.\u201d\u201cAre you going to look for me when I reincarnate? How are you going to recognize me?\u201dIt didn\u2019t make sense. If I was born again, even I wouldn\u2019t remember myself, but how could he wait? When I snorted, Hubris whispered quietly.\u201c\u2026The divine power is usually closely related to the previous life. This is because the divine power is not a physical realm, but the realm of the soul entirely. It is close to the water in a vessel called a human soul. The reason why the divine power is finite unlike magical power, is because, if the limit is exceeded, the vessel of the soul will be completely broken.\u201d\u201cBroken?\u201d\u201cIf it breaks, you can\u2019t be reborn again. It\u2019s a complete death\u2026. The same goes for witches. They\u2019re more like monsters than humans. They completely deviate from the orbit of life, so they can\u2019t grow old, die or be reborn.\u201dHubris closed his mouth for a moment and said as if he was organizing.\u201cEven if the owner of the vessel changes soul, the purpose may change, but the form does not change. In other words\u2026 I just want to say that I can see the color of the lady\u2019s soul in the next life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s crazy! Again\u2026 if I\u2019m reborn, I\u2019m no longer a stranger.\u201d\u201cThe color of the soul doesn\u2019t change that easily. It\u2019s deeper than the memory. There\u2019s probably a little bit of purple left.\u201dWas it because I learned too much that I didn\u2019t know at once? Or was it because I didn\u2019t want to believe it? I was very confused. I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, but Hubris didn\u2019t stop talking.\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a princess. This princess had to save the world, and she knew the way, but unfortunately it was never possible in this life of the princess. How the princess, who had no idea when she was going to be reincarnated, would have left it. Is it the same? Neither paper nor stone can wear out or be destroyed.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Get lost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of making a myth. With you and me coming out. Then it will be delivered to people. Find a lover with a purple soul\u2026\u2026. I can leave that information. So that the reincarnated me can recognize it. There may be a little distortion, but isn\u2019t every story different from the truth?\u201dHe was completely out of his mind. I couldn\u2019t think of any other words to express. I thought he was shit, but he was crazy. I was really tired, so I shook my head and whispered\u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who drove me crazy.\u201d\u201cHow dare you! Don\u2019t try to put it on me. Your disgusting feelings are my fault? You just needed someone to sympathize with and save.\u201dWhen I looked with evil eyes, Hubris stared at me silently with bloodshot eyes. But soon he turned away from me without saying much and disappeared. It was not until I confirmed that he had left completely that I could sit on the floor.What should I do? I tried to bluff, but if this continued, I might not be executed and die of old age. Even when I tried to use my brain, I couldn\u2019t think of anything. My teeth just clattered with fear.I kept wandering around the room and tried to come up with countermeasures. Originally, since Hubris returned, he had to save Helena to get it right.But seeing Hubris obsessed with me in a weird way now, I thought Helena might not be able to revive.The weather wasn\u2019t hot yet, but Helena\u2019s body might rot at this rate.When my thoughts went crazy, my breathing became short. No. I couldn\u2019t. How did this happen? Where did I go wrong?Time, time. I had to drag this on. I needed something big to drag this on\u2026\u2026. I suddenly remembered the empress.Come to think of it, the emperor and the empress were scheduled to die from the teacup the marquis had gotten. My hands were sweaty. No matter how crazy you were, you would not be able to save the traitor\u2019s daughter.In order to do that, I have to meet the empress, but I was trapped in this small room, so there was no way to meet the empress. If Anakin was next to me at times like this, I would have conveyed my words through him.Should I ask Medea for a favor? But I felt like she was going to refuse.Indeed, I\u2019ve been playing around with an universal key.When I turned my head after a rattling sound, I noticed a young attendant.(TL/N: I don\u2019t know if the young attendant is a boy or girl, the author wrote it too vaguely.)Maybe he came to put my meal down. It was a time when I traced my memory to a familiar face. Where, where did I see him?\u201cStop there!\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dI grabbed the child who was about to turn around. That child\u2026 he was a child who worked in the Empress\u2019s Palace.There was no reason for the Empress Palace\u2019s child to come to this remote tower. It was clear that the empress sent him to me. The child looked around for a moment and came back to me with a pause.\u201cD, do you have anything to say?\u201d\u201cDid your owner send you here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut the child hung close to the door and reached out to me. As I handed him my hand, he slowly wrote on the palm of my hand. The child said in a terrified voice.\u201cLet me go!\u201dThere are ears that are listening. From now on, write on the palm, so the lady can answer with her hands.\u201cCome on, can\u2019t you say the right thing?!\u201dOkay. I can\u2019t take too long, so I\u2019ll get to the point. Tell Her Majesty to use what I handed over.\u201cPlease forgive me, Lady Mis\u00e9rian!\u201dYes, I will say that.At the end, the child was pushed out of the door as if shoved by me and rolled on the floor. And he ran away as if he couldn\u2019t bear it because he was scared.I could breathe, I turned it around with this. When will the empress carry out the plan? It was not even estimated, but now I had no choice but to believe it.The marquis \u2018couldn\u2019t\u2019 or \u2018wouldn\u2019t\u2019 come to me? I even brought the empress in to catch the marquis, but it would have been very difficult if he noticed a hint and fled abroad.I thought the empress would be monitoring on her own even if I didn\u2019t give her any notice.I was terribly tired, physically, mentally, but somehow I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. But even if I wasn\u2019t sleepy, I had to force myself to sleep. This was because time went by too slowly if I didn\u2019t sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 84: Be It Happiness Or Hell***Melpomene sent someone to dump Eris Miserian after hearing the news that the marquis exchanged a promissory note for gold. When she told the maid to ban it, she didn\u2019t know whether it would be effective. That was because the child, who had always sent it to the tower, came back and whispered a word to use \u2018that\u2019.\u201cVicious\u2026\u2026\u201dHelena was dead. To be exact, she was barely breathing, but she was unconscious the whole time. Even though she didn\u2019t have a place to put her heart in the imperial palace, she loved the child, it was heartbreaking to see her lying down. She must have become more affectionate than she thought.However, Melpomene knew better than anyone else how useless personal affection was. Melpomene stood at the cusp of life and counted them one by one.Many days were a tragedy, and the joy of a moment was only a device to make sadness more dramatic.There were so many regrets in her life that she would never regret from now on.\u201cGo and tell His Majesty\u2026 I want to see him, so come here.\u201dThe maid disappeared, and Melpomene got up and took out the teacup herself from the cupboard. After raising the cup and looking at the moon pattern on the bottom of the teacup for a long time, she soon placed a teacup with four petals in front of her.Choosing the tea leaves took longer than that. That was because it had been quite a long time since she chose the tea leaves herself.What she chose after much consideration was the tea with a strong scent and taste. Even if the taste changed due to the poison, she won\u2019t notice it. It was a tea that she won\u2019t drink until the end anyway, but the reason she was struggling was because she thought this was really the last time.She suspected whether it was really poisonous, so she secretly scratched the inside of the teacup and fed it to a mouse, and the effect was clear. Even from a slight scratch, the mouse turned its belly upside down and died.Sitting still on the sofa waiting for Kratos, Melpomene suddenly realised that, between the two of them, the one waiting was always Kratos.Kratos did not eat food or sleep until Melpomene came. While waiting for her, what was Kratos thinking about? She had never asked before.So Melpomene finally tried to ask what he had in mind when Kratos arrived.However, when she saw Kratos\u2019 face, she wondered what was the use. They had already come to an irreversible place. Even if she knew the reason, she didn\u2019t have the confidence to understand or forgive.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you asked me to drink tea first.\u2026. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll have to check if heaven and earth have changed.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201dMelpomene poured tea into Kratos\u2019 cup without saying a word, and then into her cup.However, even though Melpomene poured the tea, Kratos did not touch the cup and looked at Melpomene endlessly. Like a person who was anxious that he would forget if he didn\u2019t capture it in his eyes for a moment.\u201cThe tea is getting cold.\u201d\u201cI prefer cold tea.\u201d\u201cLies.\u201dMelpomene took a sip of the tea from her cup and stood up. Then she approached Kratos and kissed him. Neither of the two closed their eyes. For that reason, Melpomene was convinced that Kratos had noticed. She said quietly after they finished kissing.\u201cDo you want to hear a lie?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I wanted to kiss you for the last time.\u201dMelpomene lost her words because of his words and looked down at Kratos. She was suddenly angry at the man in front of her who ruined everything.They could have been happy. Rather than this ending, they could have had a boring but warm future. Melpomene grinded her teeth.\u201cI\u2019m going to fall into hell.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t come and be born again.\u201dBlood tears were deeply ingrained in every word. Kratos looked up at Melpomene and wiped the blood flowing around her mouth silently. He looked like the boy who held her when she was young.\u201cUntil the soul wears out, I am born and die as a life that is not as good as a stone on the side of the road, let alone a dog or pig.\u201d\u201cIf you reborn and die a thousand or ten thousand times like that, will you make me your husband again during that time?\u201dAt that, Melpomene vomited blood and laughed. She seemed to have shed tears.\u201cNonsense.\u201dMelpomene collapsed first. Kratos finally gave up holding her in his arms and laid her on the floor as she was.* * *In a fading memory, the two were running together on a snowy field.Running away.In the brilliant white night that would never melt down again, the boy and the girl lost each other forever.I woke up vaguely at the distant sound of the bell. As if I hadn\u2019t slept very long, it was dawn when the day was dim.Even though spring was almost here, dawn was still cold, so I was crouching down. The bell didn\u2019t stop.Wait. How many times did the bell ring? I kicked out of bed and walked towards the sound of the bell and focused my ears on it. It was more than ten times, at least ten times. There are only two cases in which bells are rung more than ten times in the empire.First, when war broke out. Second, when the imperial family, if those whose rank was in the top three, died. There was no way that the crown prince, the male protagonist of the novel, or the grand duke, who was playing and eating in the outskirts, died suddenly, so there was only one answer.The emperor and empress died.I thought I wanted it to be as fast as possible, but I didn\u2019t know they would die so suddenly.It had not been more than a day since I spoke through the attendant.Still, I thought she would hesitate a little more because she had lived for a long time. The empress must have hated the emperor more than I thought.I expected the crown prince to visit me soon. Sure enough, the crown prince came to me with a more emaciated face than ever before.Perhaps because he lost so much at once, his hair was white like his father\u2019s in a day. What was unfortunate was that even white hair looked good on him. He sat on the bed, looked at me and said,\u201cThe marquis is the culprit.\u201d\u201cYou already know why I came. Are you an accomplice?\u201d\u201cAm I?\u201dThe tea cups bought by the marquis did not have their own feet, so there was no way to enter the Empress\u2019 Palace unless it was through me. Originally, I tried to say no because I had no motivation and had an alibi, but I was worried about changing his mind.It was enough if the marquis ordered it.I killed Helena anyway, so it was not a big deal to add another crime.I was just going to confess that I gave it to the empress, but my mouth was shut up by the person who suddenly came in. He was a close aide to the crown prince.\u201cPlease forgive me, Your Highness, no, Your Majesty, for coming without courtesy. However, I couldn\u2019t help it because the issue was urgent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThe man who was bribed by the Marquis and brought a teacup to the Empress\u2019s Palace was caught. But that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe aide closed his eyes and said.\u201cIt is Lady Justia, the nanny of Letatio. Many people have witnessed her coming and going to the marquis several times.\u201dWhat? I couldn\u2019t hide my surprise and took a breath. I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d come out here.As in the case of the Magic Gate, I only assumed that the Empress would at best bribe her maid to confess, but she used her nanny who taught her.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. She was my mother\u2019s teacher. Even after being kicked out of the palace, the two did not stop contacting each other.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 It seems that she lived quite poorly in a back alley. She has only one nephew in her family, but she didn\u2019t have the money for her niece\u2019s wedding, so she got money from the marquis to commit the crime\u2026\u201dPerhaps the nanny and empress were closer than I thought. Not only was she more reliable than others, but considering the rest of the life of the nanny, it may have been judged that it was better than sacrificing a young life.The empress would have told the nanny about the plan and asked for some work. Because the two hated the marquis. She would not have wanted to leave any room for the marquis to escape.\u201cThis is not the time for this. We must hold the coronation ceremony as soon as possible, even if it is only now.\u201dThe close aide said that and looked around for a while, but he soon said without hiding his contempt for me, as if he thought it was not worth paying attention.\u201cYour Highness has not responded, but at this rate, the snake-like Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian and the aristocracy may try to usurp the throne with the Grand Duke at the forefront.\u201dNo matter how resentful and upset the marquis was for being betrayed by the emperor, he could not commit such an emotional rebellion without going crazy.In order to make the marquis believe that he was not framed, but that he really committed rebellion, it was necessary to have something that the marquis believed in.Ironically, in order to devise a life for himself, the marquis met with people here and there, which ended in a situation where his title was cut short.To be honest, I never thought to link the marquis to rebellion because I thought it was only in vain.When I was wasting my time running away, the empress was firmly fixing the noose for her purpose.I got embarrassed again. When I was lost in thought for a moment, the aide whispered something in the crown prince\u2019s ear.He used great effort to keep me from hearing it, but it was obvious that Lady Mis\u00e9rian could not be saved anyway. The crown prince\u2019s shaking eyes looking at me were saying that.Even though he knew he couldn\u2019t save me, he kept hesitating. Because there were only a few people left around him now.\u201cHelena\u2026\u201dFinally, the crown prince spoke with a distorted face as if in pain and a voice that was completely restless.\u201cI\u2019ll spare your life if you find a way to save her.\u201dThis was what it meant to choose to talk while suffering so much and agonizing. I didn\u2019t expect to find a way to really save myself.I didn\u2019t know what the crown prince was thinking, but I wasn\u2019t actually curious. So I smiled and drew the knife.\u201cJust kill me, Your Highness. Please kill me.\u201dIf you suffered like that, you would die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was because the emperor and empress died at the same time and a joint funeral had to be held, so in that case, there was no precedent to see whether it conformed to the \u2018law\u2019.I didn\u2019t know if it was good or poisonous for me to spend time like this, but one thing was certain, it was poison for Helena.It was a shame that she was pitiful, but if she couldn\u2019t be revived like this, in the worst case, something that I wasn\u2019t aware of could happen.Like when I tried to commit suicide at first but failed. Because she was the main character of this novel.It was time to take out the mirror, thinking that I should ask the witch if Helena might never wake up. I heard someone\u2019s footsteps.I hid the mirror again and turned my eyes towards the door.\u2026.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026.\u201dYes, no wonder I couldn\u2019t see him these days.The migraine that started again made my head pound. Jason was looking at me with the momentum of breaking through the door. I hadn\u2019t said a word yet, but I felt tired already.\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d\u201cYour face is very bad. Are you eating well?\u201d\u201cNo, I asked the wrong question. Why are you here?\u201d\u201cAre you sick? The tower is quite high, and it\u2019s cold.\u2026.\u201dDespite my cold question, Jason said gibberish, constantly looked at me and continued to ask questions. I felt it even in Hubris, but somehow he was not as sane. I couldn\u2019t take it any longer and screamed.\u201cHey, Sir Kazar! Don\u2019t say nonsense. Get out of here!\u201dThen he stood close to the door and whispered in a desperate voice.\u201cRun away, Lady Miserian. Let\u2019s run away.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you cross the border, they won\u2019t chase you. You can start anew there.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start\u2026.\u201dWhat was he talking about, crazy guy\u2026\u2026. The curse filled up to the end of my throat and was hardly swallowed. Did he really think that I was going to participate in a night getaway?Also, with him? It was better to be tortured by that interrogator than to elope with him.To that extent, I didn\u2019t trust Jason at all. However, people avoided poop because it was dirty, so I just shook my head because I didn\u2019t want to scratch it for no reason.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m going to stay here and pay for my sins.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Why?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou could die\u2026 You know.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we already end this dreary conversation last time?\u201dI rubbed my tired face.I couldn\u2019t figure out why I had to convince others about my life and death.Of course, my life was mine, but why were there so many people around me who didn\u2019t understand this simple proposition?\u201cOkay. Running away with you? And what are you going to do? Can you let me go? No? You\u2019re going to stay with me, saying things like you\u2019re worried or it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cI, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that you won\u2019t touch a single hair on my body for the rest of my life, or rather, you won\u2019t beg me for my heart?\u201dBefore Jason could even open his mouth, I declared.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. Even if it\u2019s okay for now, over time, you\u2019ll cling to me and ask me to look at you, saying you\u2019ve done this for me, and you want to be rewarded.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Jason\u2019s fault. It was just a universal trait that humans had. People want to be rewarded as much as they have given. It was a truth that humans had learned since they first began trading.There might be differences in the reactions seen when expectations were broken. Some would be angry, and others would give up. There were people who wanted to adjust, and there were people who wanted to deceive. And Jason\u2026\u2026\u00a0 There was no reaction whatsoever.\u201cAlecto too\u2026 The escort knight next to you\u2026\u2026 can live long enough without you.\u201dInstead, he paused and muttered in a terribly trembling voice. He was very weak and miserable, not like the strongest man in the world.\u201cI can\u2019t live without you.\u201dJason\u2026.. begged me. He was begging for love. It wasn\u2019t a plea to be his. Rather, it was the opposite. There was no use, it was closer to a desperate plea from a person who wanted to be dependent on someone.\u201cI need you\u2026\u2026 Please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can use me, use me and\u2026.. throw me away, but please.\u201dCould such a miserable and one-sided thing be called love?\u201cI\u2026\u201dOh, yes. Maybe it was love. But,\u201cI can\u2019t take responsibility for you, Jason Kazar.\u201dEven if it was love, I didn\u2019t have an obligation to accept him.\u201cSo go back. Don\u2019t try to save me.\u201dI shouted to make Jason go, who was not going to leave. Because I thought that someone guarding this place would hear my voice and come, and naturally Jason would have no choice but to run away. But he didn\u2019t run away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you! Who\u2019s there!\u201d\u201cA stranger in front of the door\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was before the words were even finished. Ugh! The guard shouted in agony. Gasp, I swallowed my breath.The shadow on the wall clearly showed Jason cutting down and killing all the running guards. When the scream was finally over, Jason approached me, covered in blood.As I backed away with a look of fear, he wiped the blood with his sleeve with a bitter smile. But rather than wiping it, it just spread. He said in a low voice.\u201c\u2026..There must be something going on. You\u2026 I\u2019m sure.\u201dHe left those words and disappeared. I took out the mirror in my pocket that I was holding tightly and finally called out the face I was desperate for right now.\u201cMedea, something is wrong.\u201dWhen Medea finally appeared in the mirror, I asked her desperately. What happens when a body comes back to life? Medea said slowly, cleaning under her fingernails.\u201cPeople can\u2019t come back to life. That\u2019s why we turned back time, right? When you killed the crown prince.\u201d\u201cEven if the high priest saves me?\u201dMedea raised one eyebrow.It was like a sign that she was interested. I had an ominous feeling. She finally reversed her words with a smile around her mouth.\u201cOh, then it\u2019s a different story.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m going to come back to life? You\u2019re lying!\u201d\u201cAs I said. Divine power and magic are completely different kinds. Magic does not have an absolute advantage. Magic can do things that divine power cannot, and there are things that magic cannot do, but divine power can.\u201dBut somehow, Medea seemed very upset about that fact.\u00a0 She paused her words for a moment, and the witch, who was holding her breath as if to quench her anger, continued her explanation shortly after.\u201cThe divine power, as the name suggests, is a power that is related to God, and it is accumulated in the soul as humans repeat reincarnation. Since God has the power of creation and life, isn\u2019t that the way for divine power too?\u201d\u201cWait. You said God and divinity have rules and must follow them. Isn\u2019t it against the rules to revive the dead?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. \u2018Reviving\u2019 the dead is a violation of the rules. But what if you \u2018reconstruct\u2019 the body that is perfectly the same as the body of the dead? What if you make the same organs or blood as the dead organ and exchange it? What do you think will happen?\u201d\u201cHuman\u2026 can a human do such a thing?\u201dI breathed once. Humans\u2026 To \u2018create\u2019 another human body? Was that possible? How could that be a human being?Even though it was in this world, I felt like all the knowledge I knew was being destroyed. My hands trembled and Medea seemed to be shaking.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of energy. If you\u2019re unlucky, you might die because you run out of energy. But\u2026 Yes. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s completely impossible.\u201d\u201cWhat if\u2026\u2026 if I come back to life?\u201d\u201cIn the first place, the soul that fits the soul of the body was sucked in, so if you really \u2018revive\u2019, you can come back into the body.\u201d\u201cEven if I\u2019m in a different world?\u201d\u201cEven if you are in a different world. For your information, if you come back that way, your soul will be bound to this world and it will never let you go again.\u201dI lost my breath. I buried my face in my hands and breathed heavily. How long has it been, I barely cleared my voice and asked the witch.\u201c\u2026..What should I do then?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly simple. It\u2019s a permanent and complete destruction of a corpse that can\u2019t even be saved by swapping it with divine power.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re going to destroy me after I die?\u201dThen Medea looked surprised and waved her hand as if it was ridiculous and burst into laughter.\u201cOh my God, wasn\u2019t the contract \u2018returning you to the original world\u2019? It didn\u2019t include \u2018preventing you from coming back\u2019.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so cheap! Are you going to be like this?\u201d\u201cThen do you want to sign a new contract with me?\u201dMedea narrowed her eyes.\u201cI warn you, after hearing what I\u2019m going to ask you, will you say you\u2019d rather be reborn here?\u201dAfter saying that, the witch gave me a mean smile. Then a person\u2019s face suddenly came to mind as I was trying to ask how to destroy my body.Anakin. Anakin was good at erasing traces, so after I died, he would be able to come in to destroy my corpse.\u2026\u2026I thought it was impossible, but there was no other way.\u00a0 Above all, now was not the time to be immersed in sentimentality, even when the death penalty was unclear. Let\u2019s think. To have Anakin destroy my corpse, I had to be executed.\u201cMedea, send Anakin and Kynthia here.\u201d\u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t you rather leave? There\u2019s the concern that this might be heard by someone.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cTry your best to get out of there to where a mirror is. I\u2019ll take care of the rest on my own.\u201dMedea left that remark and disappeared.I looked at the toilet in the room and rubbed my face. What the hell do you want me to do\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I shoved something into the toilet to make it clog, and then I barely managed to get out.Originally, the knight was trying to come in as a guard to prevent any unforeseen situation, and I barely managed to enter by myself on the grounds that my honour would be tarnished.By the way, if I disappeared through the mirror, the knight would notice, and I didn\u2019t know what Medea was going to do. I thought I would do well on my own, but I kept worrying and doubting myself.. I looked around and tapped the mirror slightly.Medea.\u00a0Soon after my whisper, she appeared and reached out to me.Medea grabbed my hand and pulled me, and I was sucked through the mirror helplessly.\u00a0 When I woke up, the place I arrived at was Kynthia\u2019s house.As if they had already heard, Kynthia and Anakin were waiting for me in the room with their eyes wide open. Looking at those familiar faces, somehow I relaxed and laughed.\u201cLady\u2026\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to say hello. Kynthia, there\u2019s something you have to do for me.\u201d\u201cJust say anything.\u201dThe child blinked and nodded vigorously. Looking at that face suddenly made me feel guilty. I didn\u2019t mean to say anything to a child who liked me like this, but I couldn\u2019t ask for anything else. I grabbed Kynthia\u2019s cheeks and whispered.\u201cSpread rumours that I\u2019m a witch on the street.\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSpread it to the informants. You have to make as many people believe it as possible.\u201d\u201cMy lady!\u201dKynthia shouted. He asked me, trembling. Poor thing, he was terrified.\u201cDoes the lady know what she is saying right now? If you\u2019re cornered as a witch, you\u2019ll be at least executed! Don\u2019t you know how much this country hates witches?!\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll spread the rumour that I\u2019m a witch. Definitely, so that I\u2019ll be executed.\u201dKynthia was restless and wandered around the room, but eventually knelt at my feet. He grabbed my hand and shook his head.\u201cNo, lady. Please don\u2019t do that\u2026 There\u2019s a saying that living is better even when it\u2019s dog shit. Yes? Even if you regret it, you can\u2019t go back.\u2026.\u201dI knelt down to him without saying a word.Cynthia jumped, but he didn\u2019t let go of my hand. I knew I was cowardly. But it was me, not Kynthia, who was more desperate. I made eye contact with him and prayed earnestly.\u201cPlease, Kynthia. There\u2019s no one but you who can do me this favour. You found out I was a stranger last night, right? I must be executed to return to my world.\u201dKynthia\u2019s shaking eyes avoided my gaze. The child whispered in a thin, small voice.\u201cIf you\u2019re branded as a witch, you may be tortured.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u2018\u2019You\u2019ll be stoned until the moment you get to the death penalty.\u2019\u2019\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dTears dropped from Kynthia\u2019s eyes.The child nodded reluctantly. That was a relief. Actually, I thought he would say no until the end. I sighed and wiped away his tears and told him to spread the words right now.As Kynthia left the house, Anakin was watching me silently.Perhaps, now was the last chance for us to say goodbye. But I didn\u2019t even know what to say.The words \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 just lingered in my mouth. We looked at each other for a while.If I had been a real witch, I would have stopped time now. Every minute and every second that was slipping through my fingers was precious.I finally sighed and told Anakin.\u201cThere are things you have to do for me\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease name them.\u201d\u201cIt may be impossible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cYou may not want to.\u201dWhen I said that, Anakin stared at me.\u201cThere is no need for personal feelings for orders.\u201dAhh, I had such confidence that day. This man in front of me would never stray away because of love. I liked you because you were such a person. Even if you loved me, you wouldn\u2019t refuse my request because you loved me.\u201cWill my death\u2026 make you sad?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, you\u2026\u2026 Can you kill me?\u201dAnakin nodded silently. I burst into tears. But I couldn\u2019t stop talking. How long has it been since I tried to calm down with my mouth covered? I barely subdued my shrill voice and whispered to Anakin.\u201cIf I\u2019m executed, those men will come to save me. Anakin, you have to stop them. And\u2026.\u201dPlease chop my body so that I don\u2019t come back to life.* * *One day, a vicious rumour spread in the city. Lady Mis\u00e9rian was actually a witch and tried to usurp the throne by marrying the crown prince, but when the crown prince recognized her ambition and refused, finally failing to marry, she murdered the crown prince\u2019s new bride.At first, the stories that were chewed as snacks by people at the bar began to have credibility as they spread through the information guild. There were also testimonies that not one or two people heard Lady Mis\u00e9rian muttering something alone in an empty prison.Rumours continued to swell, and the myth that the sudden death of the emperor and empress was due to the witch\u2019s curse became a fact.The imperial family warned against rumours and against spreading groundless words, but it became a situation where they incited the witch, saying it was to hide what she had suffered.In addition, Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s father, Marquis Mis\u00e9rian, had the history of withdrawing from politics after being accused of opening a magic gate in the city.Suspicions had spread that the reason for the light punishment of dismissal and seizure for a crime that deserved the whole family to be executed, might have been because Lady Mis\u00e9rian, a witch, was behind it.It also came to mind that she, who deserved to be executed for killing the crown princess, was able to keep her life because of the witch\u2019s magic tricks.Marquis Mis\u00e9rian and Lady Mis\u00e9rian, who had a bad external image because they were already extravagant and arrogant. When even branded as a witch, voices calling for their execution immediately rang day after day.At a time when the people\u2019s hearts were becoming more ferocious, Alecto\u2019s coronation to the throne was held.Not long after the funeral, the coronation was held solemnly rather than splendidly.There were no firecrackers or marches. Dark purple embroidered the imperial palace, and the city also responded with silence to the tragic events that took place day after day.The people replaced the new emperor by offering flowers along the walls of the imperial palace.On behalf of the pope, who was still lying on the bed, a young and beautiful high priest stood in formal attire in the temple.Whenever Alecto walked, a purple cape fluttered. Finally, when Alecto knelt in front of Hubris, he put his hand over the crown prince\u2019s head that became white overnight.\u201cAs the heir of the Holy Empire, do you swear that you will do your best to protect the Empire\u2019s territory and its people?\u201d\u201cI swear.\u201d\u201cDo you swear that you will not bring the people into sorrow by abusing the power that has been bestowed upon you in this glorious position?\u201d\u201cI swear.\u201d\u201cAre you accepting that all your authority is subject to God, and swear that you will never fall into false beliefs?\u201d\u201cI swear.\u201d\u201cMay God protect you.\u201dWhen the coronation oath was completed, the high priest lifted the crown and placed it on Alecto\u2019s head. As he straightened his bent knee and turned his body, the knights and ministers who had previously gathered instead knelt on one knee at once.\u00a0 A majestic hymn flowed from the organ.As soon as the coronation ceremony was over, Alecto had to attend the parliamentary meeting immediately. The same was true of the ministers who participated in the coronation.As soon as the meeting began, the topic that the ministers brought up was, of course, the disposition of the Mis\u00e9rian family.\u201cNow that the coronation ceremony is over, we can no longer delay the disposition of the Mis\u00e9rian family!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Majesty. Do you know what rumours are circulating on the streets? It is said that the imperial family was possessed by a special witch. If you sit by, the dignity of the imperial family may fall!\u201dAlecto swept his face as if he were tired of the pouring voices. From the beginning, the imperial faction, which was the enemy of the Mis\u00e9rian family, as well as the aristocratic faction raised their voices saying that the death penalty should be carried out.Now that she was being accused of treason as well as being a witch, if anyone defended the Mis\u00e9rian family for no reason, they would be put in the same category and their political life would end.Alecto recalled a skinny, haggard woman trapped in the tower for a moment. Her green eyes and cynicism.He even checked with the high priest, but he actually knew that the woman was not Eris Mis\u00e9rian. But he didn\u2019t want to believe it.It was hard for Alecto to accept the fact that the child, or the one who blindly loved him, had disappeared forever.It was all the more so now that he had lost everything.Guilt, hatred, possessiveness, love\u2026\u2026. It didn\u2019t matter what the name of this infested emotion was.Alecto\u2026 desperately needed even the ghost of Eris Mis\u00e9rian.He closed his eyes, and last night\u2019s memories poured on Alecto. Secretly, he called in a substitute to examine Helena. After looking at Helena for a long time, the High Priest reported that she was under the witch\u2019s curse.When asked how to release it, the High Priest shook his head silently. It was said to be a kind of ancient magic that had been passed through at least two witches. Considering the transcendence of the witch, human power was not enough, it had to be about the level of a dragon to release it.When asked why she did not die even though she was caught in the witch\u2019s magic, the answer came back that it was not intended for her to die in the first place. He also said that if she really died, it would have been more comfortable to deal with since they could have revived her with divine power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The tone that secretly defended Eris somehow caught his heart. Were the two of them familiar?\u201cPlease make a decision, Your Majesty!\u201dAt that cry, Alecto awoke from his thoughts.\u2026\u2026Wait. Alecto clenched and opened his fist a few times. He could somehow revive her with divine powers.\u2026 What? Did the high priest have a way to bring the dead back to life?Alecto stared blankly at the noise in front of him. The humble faces were urging him to make a decision.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do that. According to national law, it is known that public execution is the principle for those related to witches.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026! Hymn to bravery!\u201dThe crowd scattered like clouds. Each of them was discussing when to execute the death penalty, how to inform people of the death penalty and instill fear and awareness to everyone.Alecto was the last to stand up. He called the loyal henchman who was already approaching.\u201cCall the high priest secretly. And maybe I can save her. If I can save her and get her somewhere\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Jason Kazar.\u201d* * *Black-haired, green-eyed witch lady\u301cYou\u2019ll be in big trouble if you\u2019re deceived because she is pretty\u301c!She is carrying a knife inside and leaving again\u301c!Eventually, she got caught and got arrested!Children ran around and sang songs in every alley. The song, which first started in the back alley, spread through the children\u2019s mouths, and eventually became a popular song that everyone in the capital humed unconsciously.However, unlike children who sang along without knowing anything, adults were accurately aware of who the \u2018witch lady\u2019 in the song was.Those who laughed at Lady Mis\u00e9rian, saying, \u201cIs she really a witch?\u201d began to whisper, saying, \u201cWill there be smoke in the chimney?\u201dWhen suspicions arose that the crown prince, who had now become emperor, was delaying the disposition of the Mis\u00e9rian family because he was implicated with the witch, the imperial family permitted the public execution of the Mis\u00e9rian family, as if to escape.Unless the person was a serious criminal, it was unusual for the empire to carry out a public execution when the system had virtually disappeared.Strangely enough, it snowed on the day of the execution, even though it was the season when green leaves sprouted. People were bewildered by the untimely snow, but they began to rave it was proof that Lady Mis\u00e9rian was really a witch.The weather was quite cold due to the snow, but the largest square in the capital was crowded with people to see the execution of Lady Mis\u00e9rian and Marquis Mis\u00e9rian.Due to the sudden deaths of the former emperor and empress, as well as the beautiful crown princess, people lived breathlessly without properly enjoying the grand enthronement ceremony and the festive atmosphere for the first time in a long time.The suppressed grievances erupted as soon as the execution date was set, making people enjoy the execution as a festival.As if it was an interesting spectacle like the ancient Colosseum, people were holding their food next and staring intently at the entrance to the Imperial Palace where Lady Mis\u00e9rian would get on a carriage. At last the gates opened and two black carriages emerged.It was not a carriage that the imperial family would ride, but it was too luxurious for a sinner to ride, and everyone cursed and spit, saying that everything was divided according to the nobles.Violent people threw the food they were eating. The first one that came out of the carriage was the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian.Marquis Miserian, who came out with his body completely skin and bones, resisted to the very end with his thin body, and was dragged away by the executioner.The first one to come out of the next carriage was an old woman who once was the late crown prince\u2019s nanny. She leaned on the executioner due to her limp and headed for the death penalty.And finally Lady Mis\u00e9rian came out of the carriage.When Lady Mis\u00e9rian stepped on her feet, everyone stopped breathing and looked at her as if possessed. Not like the rare villain who killed her childhood friend on the first night of her honeymoon after losing her fianc\u00e9e, she had a rather pitiful atmosphere.Just like the lyrics of the song, black hair, green eyes. Her sloppy figure and messy attire only accentuated her decadent charm.Even though she looked tired, she walked straight, not staggering out of the carriage unlike others. She did not allow her body to be touched, even the executioner took a step back from her and followed.In the middle of the square was a guillotine. Although guns were developed in the country, people still prefered the guillotine because if the bullet missed, you might not die at once.Due to the nature of the public execution, a podium was installed for many people to see.Lady Mis\u00e9rian climbed the stairs silently. Thousands of eyes were focused on her, but she didn\u2019t seem to care at all.Finally standing in front of the guillotine, Lady Mis\u00e9rian looked up at the sky silently and exhaled for a long time. White breath stretched out towards the sky.The figure was so elegant and beautiful that people suddenly firmly believed that such a person couldn\u2019t be a witch.The witch they imagined wasn\u2019t like that. Some thought the witch was a lustful widow, and others thought she was a cranky grandmother.Even if they had drawn a really crazy woman, they had never imagined a girl who was barely an adult as a witch. Maybe there was a mistake. The voice of a young child broke the silence as only the silence weighed heavily on the people.\u201cStrike that witch on the neck!\u201dThe child\u2019s voice was mixed with a little weeping, close to her desperate scream. The child was buried in the crowd, so they didn\u2019t know who first uttered it, but nothing incited people more effectively than the screams of a little child\u00a0 One by one, they clenched their fists and began to shout the same slogan in solidarity.\u201cStrike that witch on the neck!\u201dThe knights dispatched just in case came out to calm them down, but to no avail.\u00a0 Thousands of voices echoed through the city.Lady Mis\u00e9rian did not budge, instead embracing the united madness. It was said that someone saw it and was convinced that she was a witch.If she were a really young girl, not a witch, she would have cried in that situation.She was able to be so calm because she was a witch.Lady Mis\u00e9rian must have been a witch.* * *I had done everything I could.All I had left to do was wait. In my life, I never imagined that I would be cut off by a guillotine.\u2026. It was something that people knew but didn\u2019t know.How much time would have passed when I went back? What kind of state would my body be in?The last memory was my friend\u2019s house. I was not in a coma because of an accident, right?No, in the first place, the friend might have called 119 and taken me to the hospital.Then what happened to my job?I wonder if I got fired. As I was sick, I would not have been fired immediately, but when I returned to work, I might be under subtle pressure to resign.If I retired like that\u2026\u2026 I thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to rest for a while.I felt I had been too busy so far. I heard that the average life expectancy had been extended, but why did I live so hastily?I wanted to graduate quickly and get a job, but I never took a common leave of absence in college because I was afraid that my scholarship would be cut off.Not only was I busy preparing for a job during the vacation, but after I got a job, there was no vacation at all.I didn\u2019t regret my hard-working life, but I had lived hard so far, so I wanted to live less hard in the future.Should I go on a trip abroad for the first time? It wouldn\u2019t be too far away, but I didn\u2019t think it would be bad to visit China, Japan, and Southeast Asia somehow.Several footsteps were heard through the door. I thought that the time had come. The executioner opened the door and tried to help me.I said, \u201cI will shake off those people\u2019s hands and walk by myself.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it was because I was determined or if it was my last consideration before I died, but the executioner let go of my hand and backed away from me.I wondered if my clothes were a little dirty, but I thought it would be useless to willingly change since I was going to die anyway. In addition, they were clothes that would get dirty because of the blood if the neck was cut off.We went down the tower. The carriage standing to take me to the prison was always black like a funeral carriage.The carriage door opened. There, the appearance from when we first met was nowhere to be found, and only an elderly woman who looked old and tired was waiting for me.\u201cDid you plan to stop here?\u201d\u201d\u201cThis was my purpose.\u201d\u201cTo be executed with the Marquis?\u201d\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen I said that, she tilted her head and burst into laughter.\u201cI have lived believing that I was unlucky all my life, but this was how I saw all the blessings of my disciples in my later years. Both of them were too many for me.\u201d\u201cDid you plan to be like this when you came to my house?\u201d\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even imagine it was this big. I was just hoping that I could dig up a small corruption. But when I got a letter from an old student after a long time, something more thrilling was waiting for me. What?\u201dThe nanny, who saw my expression after saying that, shook her head and said.\u201cDon\u2019t make that face\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve lived too long. I\u2019ve lived so long that I\u2019ve seen things that I didn\u2019t want to see.\u2026.\u201dThere was no guilt or fear on her face. Only refreshingness remained like the face of a person who had finally done her job. We looked at each other silently until the carriage stopped.As we approached the square, the disturbance began to grow. I heard a lot of swearing. Sometimes there was a sound of objects thrown by people hitting each other. But when I finally got off the carriage, no one made a sound.They just looked through me, stopping. However, while living as \u2018Eris Miserian,\u2019 I received so much similar attention that I couldn\u2019t get used to it so I didn\u2019t even have any appreciation. Without a word, I walked to the guillotine in front of me.Looking up at the untimely snowy sky in front of the guillotine, I suddenly thought of Anakin. The last conversation we had inside Kynthia\u2019s house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed to be picking words as he clenched his teeth over and over again. Anakin, who refined his voice with a sigh, asked me with sad-looking eyes.\u201cAre you asking me to chop your body with my hands?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs that included in preventing you from reviving?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes.\u201dI knew it was an unreasonable request. Most countries usually did, but the empire was sensitive to the damage of the body. If the body was damaged, the owner of the soul would go to hell. Perhaps because of that, criminals who damaged a dead body were severely punished.No matter how much Anakin did not believe in God, even if he was an atheist, religious culture and customs were embedded deep in people\u2019s perceptions.It was Anakin who had already done a lot for me. I couldn\u2019t even make him do this. The moment I said it was just enough, Anakin quietly said,\u201c\u2026\u2026If I set fire, would that be okay?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s too much of a request. It\u2019s okay to refuse.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it. I want to do it. With my own hands\u2026 Please allow me to let you go.\u201dHe was always like this. No matter what I asked for, he didn\u2019t show any signs of dislike, and he tolerated my demands without saying a word.Without saying a word, my touch, my gaze\u2026\u2026 He understood and accepted everything.It was strange to simply be loyal.But if I hastily misunderstood his loyalty, I was the only one who would get hurt.I was selfish, so I only asked you at the end, after I got to the end.\u201cAnakin, me\u2026\u2026 Do you like me?Only then did Anakin laugh a little. Then he said it a little playfully.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I thought you knew.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not good enough to kiss someone I don\u2019t even like.\u201dWhen was it? No, it didn\u2019t really matter when it started.I had firmly believed that Anakin was not mine, but Eris\u2019 black knight. So I used to doubt all the actions he showed me. As Eris, it would be a favour for me as the \u2018character\u2019 of this novel.But no. It wasn\u2019t.I made you. You loved me, not Eris.Tears flowed from the truth that I realised too late. I didn\u2019t want to cry because it was the last time, but why was I always like this?Anakin hugged me silently and waited for me to calm down. When I finally stopped crying, I thought I didn\u2019t want to lose him.To be precise, I hated and regretted his future that I could not see. I felt afraid to see him meet, live, and move forward with other people in a place where I was not.To him, my appearance would be squeezed into this moment for the rest of his life. I hated it. I hated it and I was scared!\u201cMaybe it\u2019s nonsense.\u201dI knew it was crazy.\u201cIt could just be death. But if you still like it\u2026\u2026 If you\u2026 If you want.\u201dI knew better than anyone else that crossing the world was not as simple as it sounded. Maybe it was impossible to devote Anakin\u2019s whole life. But, nevertheless, I knelt down and dared to ask Anakin.\u201cDie for me. And come to my world and live with me.\u201dAnakin opened his eyes wide as if surprised when he heard it. He asked me back in disbelief.\u201cReally? Really\u2026 Is it okay to follow Master?\u201d\u201cFool, you have to get angry. I\u2019m telling you to die.\u201d\u201cI just thought I was abandoned. Even though I know it can\u2019t be helped\u2026\u2026 I guess I was expecting you to stay.\u201d\u201cAnakin\u2026\u201d(PR/N: Romeo and Juliet who? I only know Anakin and Eris)Was he crying? Anakin was crying. The first time I saw them, I embarrassingly wiped his tears with the back of my hand. Anakin saw me like that and whispered. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m allowed to chase you.\u2026 Because I\u2019m happy.Looking at him shedding tears, I suddenly thought I had the bottle in my pocket.I thought I left it with the marquis, but I didn\u2019t know how it was in the pocket.But the moment I confirmed that I had the bottle, I took it out and filled it with Anakin\u2019s tears. I felt like I had to do that.It was a very small bottle, so even a few drops of tears filled it easily. The bottle filled with tears soon disappeared like snow melting in my hand.It was neither the tears of the dragon nor any tears. It was Anakin\u2019s tears. Were the tears of the loved one a condition? We looked at my empty hands silently.Even though I knew I had to go back to the tower, I couldn\u2019t take a step when I thought it was my last chance to see Anakin\u2019s face.I didn\u2019t want to go. But I had to go.I didn\u2019t have any promise, but I might not be able to see him forever.\u2026!\u201cYou know, Anakin. I love you.\u201dEventually, before going back into the mirror, I looked back at Anakin and smiled,\u201cI wanted to keep saying this.\u201dI didn\u2019t remember Anakin\u2019s expression.* * *I pointed out that I was a witch, but when I got up, everyone just looked at me on the guillotine and didn\u2019t swear or gossip.It shouldn\u2019t be like this. I certainly had to be rebuked to never come back to this world again.I looked among people, but I couldn\u2019t see any of the people I was looking for. Of course, among these many people, there was no way that a miracle would happen to find a face at once.However, even if it was hard to find a face, the voice could be recognized at once. As I asked, Kynthia was screaming for me among these countless people.\u201cStrike that witch on the neck!\u201dThe hoarse voice, full of tears, was desperately shouting for my death. The people assimilated by the scream soon clenched their fists and shouted together.\u201cStrike that witch on the neck!\u201dKynthia was the only one out of all these people who didn\u2019t want me to die.My fingertips were shaking. But I shouldn\u2019t make it obvious. Because the witch should not be seen as \u2018human\u2019.\u201cStrike that witch on the neck!\u201dIf the world was a big play, what song would resonate at the end? Suddenly, with that thought, my neck was pushed onto the execution table. I hoped it was a grand and wonderful orchestra ensemble.\u2026 I hoped vaguely.Yes, I knew it.\u2026 The song I heard before seemed to be ringing in my ears.When I hummed a verse, it was rattling.Everything was over.* * *It was a dark night where he couldn\u2019t even hear the birds cry. Perhaps it was because of the weather that gave a chill, or because the place they were headed for was the morgue.The season was spring, but the temperature was cool enough to snow, so the two men were firmly dressed.Under the torch, he walked through the underground passage of the imperial palace, where two shadows were intertwined like the paths of a labyrinth. The reason why Jason and Hubris, who have never met each other, were together was because of Lady Mis\u00e9rian.On the night Lady Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s death penalty was confirmed, Alecto secretly called the two together.\u201c\u2026Instead of her, do you remember what you said to me in the past? You said it would be easier to revive Helena if she had died.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s how I replied.\u201d\u201cThen can I take it as a sign that you can save the dead?\u201dAt that, Jason, who was next to him, turned his head and looked at Hubris. Even without saying, everyone in this room knew what it meant.This was because there were only two women in the intersection of these three men, who seemed to be close but were not.When Hubris nodded silently, Alecto asked Hubris.\u201cSurvival means the master of the soul will come back, right? It\u2019s not like a living body.\u201d\u201cMy power is not magic, Your Majesty. It\u2019s different even from Magic Engineers.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all it matters. \u2026\u2026We will place Eris Mis\u00e9rian in a space where the bodies of the imperial families are placed underground.\u201dOriginally, it was something that was not allowed. Aside from the fact that she was no longer in the royal family because they broke up, she was executed for treason.However, it was taken into account that she remained the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e for a long time, and that there was no one to collect her body and hold a funeral because the Mis\u00e9rian family was killed.After persuading, Alecto decided to keep her body for a while, and bury Lady Mis\u00e9rian together when the temple collected the bodies of the unclaimed and held a collective funeral.Of course, Alecto had no intention of sending Eris\u2019 body to the temple from the beginning.\u201cSave her. Jason will guide you through the underground passageway. And I will leave it up to you, Jason, to escape the country.\u201dAt the words of the crown prince, Hubris asked.\u201cWhat are you going to say to the temple?\u201d\u201cA body of a similar size has been saved. There is no fear of being caught anyway, as it is the law to cover the bodies of the royal family with cloth so that they cannot check the faces.\u201dThe reason Alecto allowed the public execution in the first place was because he thought it would be easier to escape if Hubris could save Eris, making her a completely dead person and showing everyone.The general public would never dream that the dead could be revived, so even if they saw Eris\u2019 face in the process of escaping, they would only regard her as a similar person.Alecto paused for a moment and drew a picture of the face that would be trapped in the tower. He didn\u2019t intend to look at her face in case he had any lingering feelings of regret or obsession.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As long as she was still alive, maybe someday they would meet again. Hubris told Jason while Alecto was contemplating.\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you on the way to escape with Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cIf there are a lot of people, it shouldn\u2019t attract attention.\u201d\u201cThere is only the theory to bring the dead back to life. No priest had actually put it into practice. \u2026Even if it\u2019s successful right now, we have to wait and see if there\u2019s any incomplete parts-\u2014\u201dWhen Hubris poured out his words, Jason shook his hand as if he shouldn\u2019t continue.\u201cThen, once we\u2019ve escaped abroad, we\u2019ll send someone to give the high-ranking officer the address. You must know that escape is a priority.\u201dHubris had no choice but to close his mouth and nod because he couldn\u2019t throw up at those words.After Alecto\u2019s visit and before leaving, the two broke up after deciding on a time to meet again the night after the execution date.Jason, who was taking the lead without hesitation, stopped and stood tall in front of the entrance to the mortuary. Jason pulled out a sword that was cold on his waist without saying a word. When Hubris asked with a blink, Jason spoke softly.\u201cThere\u2019s already someone inside.\u201d\u201cNo way. There\u2019s no one else to come, right?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s a dog that lost its owner.\u201dJason grinded his teeth and ran inside. In the blink of an eye, Hubris also rushed along. Somehow, he had a very bad feeling.The two men who ran into each other faced a burning body and a brown-haired man standing in front of it.\u201cYou bastard\u2026 No way\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy master had already anticipated that you would come. I was lost in the second basement of the Imperial Palace, but fortunately, it seems that I narrowly got ahead.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dHubris screamed when he realised who the owner of the burning body was. He took off his cape and hurriedly tried to extinguish the fire, but he was stopped by Anakin and turned round. Anakin pulled out a sword and pointed it at Hubris\u2019 neck. Hubris shouted with bloodshot eyes.\u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve done now? She could have been saved. She could have been saved!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m following my master\u2019s orders.\u201dAs soon as Anakin finished speaking, Jason rushed in. Anakin instinctively turned and defended against it. The sound of swords clashing with each other echoed through the empty basement. Jason quickly shouted at Hubris.\u201cI\u2019ll be blocking him, so turn off the fire and save Lady Mis\u00e9rian!\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAnakin inserted his sword into Hubris\u2019 thigh, who was about to stand up. While Hubris swallowed the pain, Jason cut Anakin\u2019s waist. Unable to avoid the cut, Anakin swallowed a groan and glared at Jason sternly.Jason saw Anakin\u2019s movement and said,\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re a half-swordmaster. You\u2019ve read the instructions skillfully, but your swordsmanship is incomplete. I reached the level of swordmaster at a much younger age than you. Do you want to beat me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here right now to distinguish between victory and defeat with you.\u201dAnakin aimed at the back of the neck of Hubris, who put out the fire, but failed due to Jason\u2019s block. Anakin put a weak sword on his sword, this was the only way to barely block Jason\u2019s sword with his sword. If he hadn\u2019t done that, the sword would have been broken sooner.The fire on the body went out and Hubris put divine power into the body. Then, the skin that had been burned by the fire shone and began to regenerate slowly. Sparks flew in Anakin\u2019s eyes when he saw it.The fight between the three turned strangely. A man who tried to save her somehow, and a man who tried to stop him. And another man trying to stop such a man was fighting with blood splattering.As time went by, Anakin did his best to attack Hubris without thinking about his body\u2019s safety.Finally, Jason\u2019s sword pierced Anakin\u2019s stomach. Even with his already tattered body, Anakin did not let go of his sword.Jason looked down at him and said to him as if he did not understand.\u201cWhy is it you? I wouldn\u2019t have been so angry if you were a man with a good side everywhere.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t respect one of my master\u2019s choices, really\u2026 you don\u2019t know why?\u201d\u201cShut up! She could have changed her mind! It\u2019s just that there was no opportunity.\u201dIn response to Jason\u2019s subsequent reply, Anakin vomited blood and anger.\u201cAn opportunity? Are you sure you want to say that you wanted an opportunity? Changing someone\u2019s heart, will, and thinking! It\u2019s a great arrogance, a misjudgment!\u201dWhen Jason finally pulled out the sword that had been stuck in Anakin\u2019s stomach and tried to slash him in the neck, and when Hubris almost succeeded in reviving the body in cold sweat, the body ignited again.\u201cWitch?\u201dWhen Hubris said the word, the air immediately cracked black, and a woman with red hair escaped from it like the flame she had bloomed. She wore a black satin dress and took a light step with her pearl-stained flat shoes.\u201cI came here just in case, as expected, it was too much to do alone.\u201dJason swung the sword directly at the woman, but the woman lightly moved her body to another space.Both Hubris and Jason looked at her in fear at the gesture that convinced them that she was a witch. The woman lightly nodded and greeted.\u201cNice to meet you, gentlemen. I\u2019m sorry, I seemed to disturb you, but it\u2019s in my belief to keep my promise.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, step back, witch.\u201dHubris struggled to extinguish the flame with his divine power, but the divine power he had poured into Eris was so great that there was not much divine power left to squeeze.Jason, who glanced at Hubris, pointed his sword at the woman. But he wasn\u2019t convinced he would win.The woman also smiled with her eyes folded affectionately, as if she knew what Jason was thinking.She whispered in a sweet and seductive voice.\u201cIf it were me, I wouldn\u2019t suggest such a reckless challenge. You must be \u2018the strongest man in the world\u2019, but that\u2019s not synonymous with \u2018the strongest person in the world\u2019, right?\u201d\u201cDid anyone ever tell you that you could get hurt if you\u2019re overconfident in your own strength?\u201d\u201cOh, my. If you want to teach me, then I\u2019ll have to teach you too.\u201dDespite Jason\u2019s provocation, the woman did not lose her smile. Such provocations did not seem to be as impressive to those who listened to them all the time during their lives. .\u201cBefore that, let\u2019s greet politely for the first and last time. I\u2019ll tell you in advance, but I won\u2019t kill you. What\u2019s the fun in killing something weaker than me?\u201dInstead, she raised her skirt slightly and bent her knees gracefully. As if imitating a knight taking off her gloves before her duel and throwing it at her opponent.\u201cMy name is Medea. As the ninth witch of this land and the last witch left in the empire, some also call me Revenge.\u201dAs her eyes burned sharply, Hubris warned Jason to be careful, but it was too late. Medea\u2019s mouth corners twisted beautifully.\u201cHave you ever imagined yourself not bound by rules? Oh, baby. Whatever you imagine, I\u2019m stronger than that.\u201dAfter it was all over, Medea looked for a moment at Anakin, who was barely breathing under her feet. It was the appearance right before his death, but unfortunately she did not have the power to replenish lost lives.However, it was possible to paralyse pain so that Anakin did not feel pain.\u201cWhy are you here? I thought you wouldn\u2019t help me.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it my job to \u2018send her back\u2019?\u201dIt became something like a pun, but in fact, she didn\u2019t intend to come. Because their deal was already over, so there was no need for trouble.Visiting here and helping Anakin was more of a purely impulsive whim. She wanted to watch the end of a woman who could have been her sister.As he spat out the rising blood and cleared his throat, he quietly asked.\u201cAm I going to die?\u201d\u201cA few days later.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you regret it?\u201dAnakin thought for a while and soon nodded his head a little. Anakin said quietly.\u201cI dare to follow her. So\u2026 I actually wish to beg you. It may be impossible, but I\u2019m asking you to tell me how I can chase her.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re an honest kid.\u201d\u201cIf I knew this would happen, I shouldn\u2019t have said I\u2019d chase her. She might be waiting for me\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven his regret was not his own death, but his master\u2019s waiting. Medea laughed, raising her neck to the knight in front of her, her terrifyingly and grotesquely loyal one. She had seen many human figures, but he was the first to be so blind.Suddenly, she became curious. Could he be so blind even if he fell into a completely unfamiliar environment? Wasn\u2019t his blindness the imprint that birds saw on their first hatchling?\u00a0 Medea quietly opened her mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a story.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 90:\u00a0It Wasn\u2019t Goodbye, It\u2019s See You LaterBetween the soul and the body, any witch, subject of use, or priest, would value the soul side.In the first place, that was attributed to the premise of reincarnation. Even if their memories disappeared, if the souls remained intact, they could be reborn.The same was true of the witches who could not be born again. For them who transcended everything, the disruption of the body had no meaning.As long as the soul was not damaged, it was enough to restore the body again. That was why ordinary people often thought of the soul as \u2018the kernel\u2019 and the body as \u2018the shell.\u2019However, when a soul crossed the world, all standards originated from the body.Firstly, even if the soul passed over, if there was no vessel to contain the soul, it couldn\u2019t be alive. Secondly, from the body\u2019s perspective, the material for the \u2018gate\u2019 through which the soul passed through the body must have been found.If the gate asked for \u2018the most loved one\u2019, the soul that entered the body had to offer the one loved the most by the original owner of the body, not the one they loved the most.The reason why this happened was because the stranger who first crossed the world deceived God and won.The stranger asked God to do his favour because he would save the world as he wanted, and God allowed it on the condition that he would save the world.As promised, the stranger who saved the world refused all the fantastic gifts from God and asked to return to his world.God, whose gift was rejected, was grumpy and demanded that he sacrificed what he valued most if he wanted to return to his world.However, God made one mistake, he did not decide whether it was the most precious thing of the \u2018body\u2019 or the most precious thing of the \u2018soul\u2019.The stranger killed the horse that the owner of the body he had possessed, valued most and fulfilled the conditions. Later, God realised his mistake. But he could not reverse his promise, so he had to let the stranger go.\u201cIt took two people\u2019s understanding for her to cross the world. The understanding of the person who loved her and the understanding of the person she hated.\u201dIn other words, in order to cross the door, the person whom \u2018Eris Miserian\u2019 hated, and the person who loved \u2018Eris\u2019 needed to understand. Anakin suddenly recalled when he had shed tears.\u201cAre you talking about my tears?\u201d\u201cOh, my. What you loved was the stranger, not \u2018Eris\u2019. I\u2019m sorry, but your tears were not conditions, but a price. Did you forget? She hasn\u2019t paid me yet. I needed tears from someone who was purely delighted.\u201dMedea recalled something, sweeping her lips with her fingers.\u201cShe left without knowing that someone she had never expected had already shed tears for \u2018Eris\u2019. Poor Emma. By now, she might have been crying until the snow melted down.\u201dAfter speaking, Medea reached out her hand to the sky in an elegant and exaggerated tone, as if in a play. She whispered as if reciting a verse from a play. At that moment, even though it was a basement, he had the illusion that light was pouring in.\u201cMay you be forgiven for inserting a knife into a hateful person. Even if you are separated from the one you love forever, may they understand your choice. So that when we finish the play of life, we may be applauded by everyone. \u201cMedea turned gracefully to greet him, and her skirt fluttered. She put her hand on Anakin\u2019s forehead, who was slowly dying. Then she continued to talk. She didn\u2019t seem to care much about whether he could hear it or not.\u201cBecause you were born and raised here, the way for you to cross the world is completely different from the way the stranger returned. In fact it\u2019s actually harder. The most powerful women in the world; the strongest woman, the most influential woman\u2026.. You need the power of the three.\u201dMedea closed her eyes, but the world was as bright as day.\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky, baby. You\u2019ve already met all three of them, and you\u2019ve earned them a favour.\u201d* * *I woke up from my dream with a seizure. My friend said she didn\u2019t wake me up because she thought I was sleeping, but she said something felt wrong and when she looked it up, I wasn\u2019t breathing. She was shaking me awake because she thought I had sleep apnea, but I woke up when she was about to call 911.(PR/N: sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterised by temporary stopping or irregular breathing during sleep.)I pushed my friend away and ran into the bathroom to check my face. It looked like this. My face used to look like this.When I washed my face with cold water, my friend was looking at me with a puzzled face. Are you sure you are okay? I struggled to smile at the question.I looked at the watch and saw that four hours had passed. There was a saying that even if you lived your whole life in a dream, it was only a moment when you woke up, but it hadn\u2019t hit me yet.I stared blankly at the romance fantasy novel next to me. Come to think of it, it took about four hours to finish reading that novel.Was it all a dream that I went through after reading a novel? In vain, I grabbed and opened my empty hands. I could still vividly remember my life there.My return meant that Anakin had done what I asked from him.Anakin, what happened to Helena?My head was dizzy from worries.* * *A few days have passed. I was achieving things that I had decided to do in this world one by one. I wanted to quit my job right away, but I ended up working a little more due to the issues of takeover.These days, I paid attention to holiday packages on the internet every day with the intention of travelling abroad when I received the severance pay.I couldn\u2019t sleep deeply and woke up from my dream because my throat was being cut off over and over again. In the end, I had been regularly visiting a neuropsychiatrist for a while.I couldn\u2019t tell them everything, but I think I was getting a little better after taking medicine steadily.I also went to my parents. I went and drank a cup and took the energy to confess my upset and disappointment.My parents comforted me, but it didn\u2019t mean that they understood me. I think that was\u2026\u2026 It was no different from comforting for a moment before the word \u2018endure it\u2019 came out.They haven\u2019t changed. I decided to understand that there were things in the world that couldn\u2019t be achieved only by effort.I often cried. Sometimes I wanted to call the publishing company and ask them to change the writer, and then ask the writer why he wrote it like that.I haven\u2019t been able to find the publisher\u2019s phone number yet, because a thread of reason stopped me saying it was the truth.As I walked down the street, I stopped and looked at people\u2019s faces. Perhaps Anakin came after me.After spending time standing there for a long time, I went back the way I had walked with not even tears in my eyes, feeling only the fact that I would never see him again.I didn\u2019t look at my cell phone anymore. Even when walking on the street, even when I was on public transportation, I was busy checking the faces of people who were waiting for the crosswalk signal.Just in case, just in case. I kept catching myself. I looked forward to it every day and was disappointed every day.Have you not crossed the world? Was it impossible even if you dedicated your life to it?It might have been my delusion. Maybe it was just a midsummer night\u2019s dream. Even if he said that he had crossed the world, how would he recognize me, whose appearance and voice have changed? In this vast land, in the midst of so many people.It started again. As I began to cry, people passing by glanced at me. While I was at it, I wanted to sit down and cry, but I stepped out of the way because I thought it would interfere with the traffic because I was in the middle of the road. To make matters worse, I felt a drop of water on the top of my head.What had fallen drop by drop soon turned into a shower and soaked me. I thought it was better, so I stopped wiping my tears and was walking with tears as much as I wanted.A man with an umbrella walked from across the narrow street. I habitually looked at the man in the face. And finally.\u201cAnakin?\u201dEverything had changed, but somehow I was strangely convinced. I had always been confident that I would be able to recognize him at first sight if I met him.Honestly, I didn\u2019t know why my groundless confidence had sprung up so much. People usually called it fate.The man looked at me reflexively at my question. He tilted his umbrella towards me to block the rain, and soon smiled. His shoulders and eyes were getting wet.In this situation, kisses were clich\u00e9, but there must have been a reason why clich\u00e9 things in this world were loved.Like the dazzling ending of a play, movie and story, we kissed. Then we never broke up again.\u2014The End\u2014Jasmine\u2019s Note:\u00a0Oh my god, it\u2019s my second novel to be completed!

Now that we are here, can we give a big shout out to Emma? \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95Dea\u2019s Note:\u00a0No because for real, I needed a second to remember who Emma was haha, you go Emma, the hero we didn\u2019t know we needed. Thank you so much Jas for translating this novel and congrats on completing it! It\u2019s one of the best ones I\u2019ve read so far, it\u2019s so realistic, frustrating and sad, but also heartwarming and cute at times. It was truly an experience going on this journey with those characters. Thank you Ame for having my back and making sense of the odd confusing sentences and thank you to everyone who read it, hope you enjoyed it!! ^^Ame\u2019s Note:\u00a0Actually, sorry Anakin, I kinda like you but in my opinion, the women are the best characters in this novel \u2013 Eris, Helena, Medea, Emma, the Empress\u2026 I am very relieved that I named one of the chapters \u2018Emma\u2019 :\u201d) If I didn\u2019t, it would be such a disservice to that lovely woman who quietly supported and rooted for Eris from the side. Much thanks to Jasmine for translating this novel, and Limu and Dea for proofreading this.

What was in her eyes was not excitement or relief, but clear despair and fear. She screamed as if she was facing a monster she should not have seen. She hated him, but never feared him.\u201cGet out before I kill you!\u201dAlecto was perplexed but tried to convince her. His mind quickly went back to calculating. The meeting between Alecto and Eris was always thoroughly calculated. There was an intention implied in every word and action.Obviously, it was to scare him and get a head start.Alecto interpreted Eris\u2019 yelling like that. If it was \u2018Eris\u2019 from the past, the interpretation might not have been wrong.However, when Alecto crumpled his forehead and grabbed Eris\u2019 arm to calm her down, Eris shook wildly to escape his arms.Ah, when he missed her in the meantime, her thin body twisted helplessly to the floor.Her eyelids trembled as she coughed, as if she was about to run out of breath.No, she might die. Die?This child was going to die? Alecto asked blankly. He didn\u2019t even think about that future.\u201cWhy, why are you doing this\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoctor! Call the royal doctor right now!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her\u2026\u201dEven though the interrogator called out to the royal court at the top of his voice, Alecto could not escape the shock. He barely convinced himself to leave.However, Alecto had never imagined that Eris would die so fleetingly, even if she would leave.Was this also an extension of the nightmare?When the breakup was confirmed, he ran out to the empress\u2019 palace after hearing from the royal attendant that she had entered the palace after a long time. This was because in the corner of his mind he was convinced that he would no longer be able to see that face unless it was now.Again, Alecto was born and raised as a crown prince. That meant that as soon as he learned to walk, he had to learn self-defense techniques, learned cesarean as soon as he spoke for the first time, and always had to rationally doubt the intentions of the other person when dealing with someone.\u201cYou\u2026. have changed.\u201dIt was an impulsive choice to spit this out.\u201cYou love me.\u201dI love you.That voice still stood out.Then Eris, who was laughing like a crazy person, finally grabbed him and started an unbelievable story.A nonsensical story that a girl who had dreamed of becoming his crown princess was not rewarded for her efforts, so she made a wish to make herself disappear from this world, it was a vain story created by using this.\u201cYou know\u2026 Then who am I?\u201dHer eyes had changed one day. Was it because her love changed or because the person changed?It was only after hearing that question that Alecto could finally understand. All those mysterious reasons were solved by drawing a single trajectory.\u201cYou\u2019re a different person? Lies. You\u2019re lying. You really went crazy.\u201dAlecto\u2019s hand trembled. He was confident that he knew Eris Mis\u00e9rian better than anyone else.But when he looked back, he didn\u2019t know anything about her. How did Eris laugh? He didn\u2019t remember a single thing about how she spoke or what habits she had.He couldn\u2019t even picture the performance of Eris Mis\u00e9rian\u2019. So he couldn\u2019t even tell if the woman was lying.\u2013 I wish you hadn\u2019t been born.All he remembered were the harsh words he said to her. Alecto held her hand again when the woman in front of him stood up and tried to leave. Eris, or the woman who was not Eris, shook her hand.\u201cIf you\u2019re not Eris, where is the child?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s dead. No, she\u2019s gone forever rather than dead. You\u2019ll never see her again.\u201dThe woman forcefully said so. And Alecto instinctively knew that what the woman said was true. He lost strength in his hands.Oh, he had lost something terribly lovely forever. He couldn\u2019t believe that someone who loved him the most in the world had disappeared, so it hurt every time he breathed in as if his lungs were stabbed.Although he didn\u2019t have anything from the beginning, he had no immunity because it was the first time he had lost something he had.\u201cI can\u2019t see her again?\u201dAlecto began to cry. No one comforted him this time.It snowed for several days. My white breath was cold. The servants diligently heated the air in the house, but I opened the window like a tree frog and smelled the winter scent.(PR/N: \u2018tree frog\u2019; a person who behaves erratically.)I had been trying everything to see what were the tears\u2019 the witch spoke about, but they were all in vain. It was neither my tears nor Anakin\u2019s tears. wonder if it was Helena\u2019s tears, but it was unlikely that one person would fulfill two conditions.\u201cYoung lady\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIgnore it. If they come tomorrow, at least pour some water on them.\u201dJason and Hubris kept knocking on the door of the mansion. They came to see me, asking me to meet them, but I sent them all back because it would be tiring just to meet them.As I wrinkled my brow in tiredness, the maid looked at me. She took a deep breath and added.\u201cAt least if they catch a cold, they won\u2019t come while they\u2019re recovering.\u201d\u201cShould I send all the invitations back?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. I don\u2019t plan on staying here for a while.\u201dJason and Hubris were not the only ones who came to see me. Everyone wanted to meet me. To be exact, they want to see Eris fall, but\u2026That\u2019s why I was intentionally stuck inside the house. If I die, I would be dead, would you like to see such a spectacle?I still slept brokenly and woke up. I thought everything was okay now, but it was still the same. As I couldn\u2019t sleep properly, I lost my appetite and became sensitive.Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t control my anger and nervousness, so I had a few people around me.It was unfair. What did I do so wrong? Would it have been less painful if I called someone else without killing the crown prince? If I hadn\u2019t gone to the imperial palace in the first place\u2026\u2026. The question of if constantly bothered me.What if I called someone else? Alecto was the crown prince of this country. It was also unclear whether the crown prince could be questioned for a crime just because he touched his fiancee.\u2026\u2026Was it fair for me to kill him? If individual retaliation could replace punishment, there would have been no need for laws to be made in the first place.Funny. Alecto, who actually sinned against me, wouldn\u2019t even have these worries.No, it was not. Let\u2019s not think about this.I had definitely sinned too. Even if the person didn\u2019t remember, it was true that I had blood on my hands even if time went by and it didn\u2019t happen.\u2018If I denied it, it would be contradictory for me to resent Alecto.pressed down on my twitching forehead. Let\u2019s not think about it. It was already in the past, and it was irreversible. Although the pain remained like a scar and bothered me, time would solve it all. Time, because all I had left was time.Thinking so, I tried to forget the fact that I had to kill Helena myself.\u2026 The imperial family announced yesterday that it would reinstate the status of the Antebellum family, which was executed for treason during the \u201cGreat Pursuit.\u201dAccording to the results of the re-investigation, which ended not long ago, it was found that the Antebellum family rather dissuaded former Crown Prince Letatio at the time of the \u2018Great Pursuit.\u2019However, now that the Marquis Mis\u00e9rian broke the engagement of Lady Mis\u00e9rian on charges of treason, speculation was coming out that the imperial family\u2019s unusual reinstatement is to promote Helena Antebellum, who was the crown prince\u2019s favourite, as the new crown princess.Reading the newspaper brought by the chief servant briefly contained the news that Helena\u2019s status was reinstated. As suspected in the article, the crown prince couldn\u2019t be married to a commoner, so it must be prepared in advance.It was true that they were falsely accused, so there was no problem with being reinstated.The marquis had been locked up in the room for the past few days and drank alcohol. Sometimes he went out and met people then came back. I didn\u2019t know if it was going well, but he always came back with a stiff face.I might be able to play with the marquis that had fallen down, but he must not want my help. No, maybe he wanted his money.It was honor and power that Marquis Mis\u00e9rian was deprived of, not money. Of course, half of the family\u2019s assets were seized, but the Mis\u00e9rian family had somuch wealth that it was comparable to the imperial family.Perhaps even if the marquis played and ate for the rest of his life from now on, he would have enough property left to pass on to Eris.Come to think of it, he was a man of extraordinary business skills. If he was born a merchant who was not interested in power, he would have been happier. It must have been more miserable because it was usually human nature to cover what one does not have.Now that Helena had become a noble again, it was a long way to get married. According to the scheduled narrative, I had to hide in Helena\u2019s honeymoon room on the day of her wedding, so time was flying.While thinking about what to do, I thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to look for an \u2018unread world\u2019.Come to think of it, while reading the novel, Eris\u2019 mother never appeared.There was no way that the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian gave birth to Eris, so she definitely existed. Of course, I was busy dating, but I couldn\u2019t even unravel the story of the villain\u2019s family relationship, so I suddenly became curious.What kind of person was Eris\u2019 mother? Was she arrogant or sweet?Would she look like Eris? Or wouldn\u2019t she look like her? Until what age did she stay with Eris? Maybe she died immediately after giving birth to her?I found a maid who was always by my side to solve that curiosity. When asked what kind of person hermother was, she swallowed her breath for a moment She hesitated for a long time, looked around for a moment, and soon whispered with her mouth in my ear.\u201cBehind the master\u2019s study, there\u2019s another room.\u201dIt was an unexpected answer. As far as I knew, the library of the Mis\u00e9rian family was located at the end of the mansion, so there would be no more rooms\u2026.. She blinked, grabbed my hand and spoke eagerly.\u201cYou can\u2019t get caught.\u201d\u2026.To that extent? I had an ominous feeling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Emma addressed Eris\u2019 father as \u2018Master, and Eris\u2019 mother as Owner.In the next chapter the perspective changes from Emma\u2019s mother to Emma because at that time, Emma\u2019s grown-up when Eris was born.After dinner, I looked around and stepped into the study. The room, located at the end of the aisle on the first floor, was completely different from the family\u2019s study I went to when studying writing.Just in time, the marquis was away today as well,When I turned the door knob of the study, there was a rattling sound, but it did not move. Looking at the tightly locked doorknob, 1 pondered for a moment Should I ask to have it opened? However, it bothered me that the maid whispered that I should not be caught.Most of the attendants of this mansion were not mine, but the marquis\u2019. If caught, there was a high possibility that they would stop me or confess it to him.Even if I heard a sound later, I should go in and find out what he was hiding. I called Anakin a little.\u201cAnakin, I have to go over there. Don\u2019t cut the whole thing. It\u2019ll make a sound.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe cut down the doorknob and opened the door according to my command. I called Anakin as entered the room.\u201cKeep watch here. When a servant comes, send him away.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do if someone who is not a servant comes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. There is nothing we can do if the original owner of this room comes. Let him in. You don\u2019t have to scratch it and make crumbs.\u201d (PR/N: an idiom for making things worse/bigger by doing something that shouldn\u2019t be done.)Leaving Anakin, who bowed his head, behind, I took a step into the study. At first glance, it was an ordinary study\u2026\u2026 It was definitely a little small. It felt like a wall was built in one room to divide it into two.I approached the bookshelf, Tooked around and swept across.The family tree of the Mis\u00e9rian family was placed among them, so I picked it up. I read it while flipping through.I didn\u2019t know the name of the marquis or the name of Eris mother, so I had to hope that Eris would be written on the family tree. And almost at the end of the page, Eris\u2019 name came out.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe names of the two were written above Eris\u2019 names. Carnival Axel, Quies Mis\u00e9rian. It was unlikely that the woman\u2019s name would be \u2018Carnival Axel\u2019. Then it means that Eris\u2019 mother was \u2018Quies Mis\u00e9rian\u2026 Did that mean the Marquis of Mis\u00e9rian was a live-in son in-law?When I turned the book over to the end, a letter was stuck in it. I opened the letter and hesitantly looked through the contents.\u2026\u2026She\u2019s not interested in the family business, so I\u2019m going to find a man who can continue the family business instead of her. I can find a partner from another powerful family, but he can\u2019t ignore her just because she doesn\u2019t do anything. It would be nice if could choose him as an ambitious and meticulous man from a fallen noble family\u2026..When I finished reading the letter, I noticed a book with exceptionally lesser dust. When I pulled the book slightly, the bookshelf opened with a click. Something white was shining beyond another cleverly hidden room.I went inside as if possessed and looked. It was\u2026 a coffin. Like a scene from Snow White, a woman with black hair was asleep in the coffin.Without having to read her name engraved on the side of the coffin, I could recognize who she was at a glance. Because she resembled Eris that much.When I took my eyes off the coffin containing the body and looked around the room, it was full of things that looked like Quies Mis\u00e9rian\u2019s items.It felt as if he had moved everything related to her into this place. Then I heard someone\u2019s urgent footsteps.My body was roughly turned. I teased the marquis a lot, but I\u2019ve never seen his face so angry. The marquis whose face was red and trembling, soon raised his hand and grabbed me by the wrist.\u201cYou\u2026 disgusting. You know that, right?\u201dCatching my trembling arms, he pushed me out of the room. As the marquis tried to catch me again, Anakin, who approached, put the sword at the marquis\u2019 neck.\u201cLet go. She is not one to be treated recklessly.\u201d\u201cHow dare you\u2026\u2026 You don\u2019t know your place and you shouldn\u2019t talk to me!\u201dAnakin silently brought the sword closer to the marquis neck. Blood began to fall from the marquis\u2019 neck. Only then did the marquis let go of my shoulders without saying a word as if he had calculated that he could not win.I shook off my shoulders as if something dirty was on me and faced the marquis next to Anakin. Anakin still lifted up the sword.I spoke quietly to the marquis.\u201cIf you answer my question, I\u2019ll shut up and forget about it.\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m threatening you right now. I don\u2019t think killing you here would make any difference.\u201dBlood began to pool under the marquis\u2019 feet.\u201cWhy did you have the body of Quies Mis\u00e9rian stuffed?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean stuffed? Watch your mouth\u2026\u2026.! just did what she wanted.\u201d\u201cShe wanted it?\u201d\u201cYeah. She\u2026.. wanted to die beautifully.\u201dThe marquis swallowed a painful groan once and added the words.\u201cI called it postpartum depression. But\u2026.. She originally had no lingering feelings about this world. Same for me, our daughter also wasn\u2019t good enough to catch her interest.\u201dAfter saying those words, the marquis closed his mouth and looked at us. His eyes were telling me if I wanted to kill him, to kill him. However, despair was deeply cast on his determination. Somehow, my enthusiasm died down and I asked Anakin to pull down the sword.We turned our backs to each other without saying a word. I was in Eris\u2019 room, and he was\u2026\u2026 he headed to the room where Quies Mis\u00e9rian was lying.When I returned to the room, the maid was waiting for me inside, restless. She looked at my face and immediately collapsed as if her legs had no strength.\u201cDo you know how nervous I was when the Marquis came?\u201d\u201cSorry. I made you worry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You don\u2019t have to apologize to me, lady.\u201dI sat on the bed and looked down at the maid and asked.\u201cYou said my mother died shortly after I was born, right?\u201d\u201cThe madam died by the time you were being breastfed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did she get sick?\u201dThe maid stuttered for a moment and said,\u201cProbably, yes. She was originally weak, but I heard she got worse after giving birth.\u201dThen why did the marquis say that? The marquis described Quies Mis\u00e9rian as if she had killed herself. The maid blinked slowly and added quietly.\u201cBut even if you brought the master\u2019s best physician, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to cure an incurable disease. She didn\u2019t have the will to get better.\u201d\u201cMy father said my mother had postpartum depression.\u201d\u201cPostpartum depression? Well\u2026 My mother, who had been watching the owner since she was young, said, she was consistent until the day she died.\u201d\u201cThat story\u2026 Can it be more detailed?\u201dShe was obviously hesitant, but then bit her lip. As is always the case with those who hesitate, the story started with \u2018I don\u2019t know the details.\u2019(Note: From this point on, Emma is telling the story from her mother\u2019s perspective.)The owner had been a docile and clumsy child since childhood. Children usually express their opinions through crying and laughter, right?But the owner neither cried nor laughed. That\u2019s why the lady\u2019s grandmother and grandfather were worried a lot. (PR/N: lady\u2019 as in Eris.)Was the child not smart enough\u2026? That was.That was why they appointed a tutor a little earlier than others, but contrary to their worries, they were told that she was rather clever. If she was taught, she understood everything, so even if it was a daughter, they had no other successors, so it was enough to educate her as the head of the family.But the owner wasn\u2019t interested. So they were frustrated and asked the owner herself. What in the world do you want to be? We\u2019ll support you no matter what you say. Do you know what the owner answered?\u2013 Father, I don\u2019t want to be anything. I\u2019m not interested in anything, and I\u2019m just tired of living. Do / have to do anything? Does a girl have to do anything?My mother was across from the lady\u2019s grandfather, so she clearly saw the expression at that time. She said, she never saw such a sad expression in her life. I would have done the same.What parents wouldn\u2019t be sad when their finely raised daughter acts like a person who was going to die right away?The lady\u2019s grandfather and grandmother said that anything would be fine, so they struggled to arouse the interest of the owner. They taught her instruments, raised animals and plants, and even taught her gambling by attaching a handsome and eloquent man.But nothing caught the owner\u2019s attention.Getting married was the last choice. The reason was that if you have a family, give birth to children and raise them, you will have some fun in your life, Someone said that the owner was not interested in animals and plants, but they firmly believed that raising a child was a different thing.Except for the imperial family, this family was the richest in the capital, so naturally hawks came and went until their feet were worn out. However, the grandfather wanted to bring in a live-in son-in-law, saying that a child who did nothing could be bullied if she went to someone else\u2019s house. He also had to take over the Mis\u00e9rian family. (T/N: hawks is used as a metaphor with the noble men trying to get married to Quies Mis\u00e9rian so that they can feed on their wealth)That\u2019s how the marquis was chosen. He said he liked him because he was a man who was sincere and ambitious, but could not fulfill his desire due to his poor and powerless family. The owner\u2019s parents said, they wouldn\u2019t get involved in anything as long as he let the owner do nothing as she did until now.The unfortunate thing was\u2026 the marquis fell in love with the owner. The marquis would have done anything for the owner, his wife, but the owner wasnot happy with anything. Even though she didn\u2019t refuse when he held the owner in his arms\u2026\u2026 that didn\u2019t mean permission. The master didn\u2019t even feel the need to refuse.The despair of the marquis who knew that\u2026\u2026. was incredible. The marquis began to go outside. Drinking and gambling, of course, he even called a prostitute to his house. He was going to show it to the owner.The owner didn\u2019t change her expression even though she knew that the prostitute had taken over the bedroom. She just slept in the rest of the rooms. Because there were a lot of rooms.T/rant: my guess is that Quies might be stranger?Anyways, a detailed information on the new character name!:Quies Mis\u00e9rian: mother of Eris Mis\u00e9rian and the owner of Mis\u00e9rian, she in particular from birth didn\u2019t have interest in anything, no matter what her parents or the husband did for her. Not even the birth of Eris made her change and eventually died after giving birth to her.Meaning of \u201cQuies\u201d: the word Quies is the root word of \u201cQuiescent\u201d which means \u201crest or quiet.\u201dCarnival Axel: Father of Eris Mis\u00e9rian, originally from a weak noble family, he fell in love with Quies Mis\u00e9rian, but sadly his love wasn\u2019t reciprocated, he fell into depression and started to sleep with prostitutes and his obsession with making Eris sit on the highest seat is because, that is the only thing he couldn\u2019t give to Quies, to get her interest in him.Meaning of the name \u201cCarnival\u201d: There isn\u2019t a special \u201cmeaning\u201d to it as such but anyways this is what I gotan instance of merrymaking, feasting, or masquerading.Meaning of \u201cAxel\u201d: Axel is a Scandinavian form of the Hebrew name Absalom. He has the incredible meaning of \u201cmy father is peace,\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The marquis\u2026 Maybe he was looking forward to it. If she had a child, the owner would change. The marquis faithfully cared for the owner. Even Her Majesty would not have enjoyed such luxury.The owner had some morning sickness, and didn\u2019t eat raw vegetables.\u2026. The chef had a hard time because she barely touched the meat and put only a little fish and fruit in her mouth. I went to the market every morning and tried to buy all the fresh fish. Fish was also precious because the capital was inland.The young lady (Eris) who came out after the last month of pregnancy was safely completed\u2026\u2026 She was really pretty. I had never seen such a pretty baby again in my life.But the owner was expressionless even after seeing the lady. It was like she was checking what she had been carrying for 10 months.She breastfed, but she did it just because her breasts were pumping, and she didn\u2019t feel like \u2018feeding her child\u2019 at all.The owner\u2026\u2026The owner said that she had fulfilled her duty because she had a child. At the time, I was a little over half my height now, but I still remember the owner\u2019s expression and way of speaking vividly. Everyone around her tried, but nothing caught her interest.( Note: Emma\u2019s grown up now, perspective shifts from her mother to her.)When she heard that, my mother cried like a child. The marquis also made a wish. He prayed, he got angry, he cried, he went crazy. The marquis tried hard, but\u2026\u2026 love didn\u2019t come in return. The owner\u2019s last will was to preserve herself permanently.No one knew why the owner left such a will.\u2026 The marquis was very distressed. However, soon after, according to the owner\u2019s will, magic engineers were called in to preserve the body and store it in a coffin. And he drove all the things that reminded him of the owner behind his study.He locked everything in there.Now I understand why the marquis said. \u2018You will be happy if you sit in the best seat.\u2019 I wondered where that belief came from, he might have become obsessed because it was the only thing he couldn\u2019t do for Quies Mis\u00e9rian.The same was true for believing that it was postpartum depression. From beginning to end, he didn\u2019t want to believe that she wasn\u2019t interested in him at all. Anyway, why did she ask to preserve herself permanently? Was there a secret hidden in that body?It was a night full of thoughts.* * *It was the beginning of spring. In the Imperial Palace, the marriage of the crown prince and Helena was officially announced.The reason for the marriage, not engagement, was that they were not young, and this time, they showed their desire to thoroughly prevent an unexpected \u2018accident\u2019.Of course, it was not that there was no backlash. In particular, the nobles, who had still remained, stood up on the grounds that Helena had learned nothing to become empress. But the rumors that I was crazy were almost certain, and there was no substitute for me so it was dismissed.The imperial family seemed to be introducing Helena by inviting the nobles every day to break through such suspicions.I taught her for a while, and now the backlash gradually subsided because a professional teacher was really sticking to her and educating her.The marquis began to stir me up as soon as the marriage was announced, but I was ignoring it because there was a proper time for everything. The marquis couldn\u2019t even enter the palace, so he would have no choice but to wait for me whether he liked it or not.There was also a request from the empress to help with the wedding. Of course, that may not be the real purpose, but I was dumbfounded and just ignored it.She had no shame. Why would you want me to help you with that? If the slang for hair growing on your conscience was true, her conscience would have been full.(PR/N: \u2018\uc591\uc2ec\uc5d0 \ud138\ub0ac\ub2e4\u2019 means \u2018what you\u2019re doing is very shameless\u2019 as in iIf you don\u2019t have a conscience, you can\u2019t feel shame\u2019.)However, I thought I wanted to see Helena get married. It must be beautiful.That\u2019s how it was described in the novel.I had certainly believed Helena would love Alecto. But now that their marriage was getting closer, I kept thinking about what Helena told me.If I had asked her back then if she loved Alecto, and if she were frustrated and said she didn\u2019t like that question, would something have changed?\u2026\u2026It wouldn\u2019t have changed. I would have said she still had to get married though. That was the planned narrative. Only then\u2026 I could go back.I took out the hidden knife and smoothed it. I had to stab her. But\u2026 could I really stab her? It was so painful even after killing the crown prince. Kill her, and I\u2026\u2026. could I live as if nothing had happened even if I went back to my world?No! I pulled my hair out.No. That would be running away. Knowing that Helena would be revived by Hubris, I dared to weigh that once I died, it would be the price for her life. I had decided to die anyway, but it was abominable.I think I wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it.It was clear that killing the innocent would really drive me crazy. I was going to have nightmares about her and cry for the rest of my life.\u2026. The sin would never be washed away.Let\u2019s run away.One morning, I suddenly thought of that. Helena shouldn\u2019t die. Even though she had no reason to die, I couldn\u2019t use her as a tool only for my death.I only thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if she died when I didn\u2019t know Helena. Because she was just the main character from the book to me.However, after I met Helena and talked to her, I couldn\u2019t get rid of the idea that she wasn\u2019t that type of person.\u2013 Learning is really fun, right? I never learned it, so I didn\u2019t know.\u2013 It would have been nice if I knew this earlier.\u2026.Unlike the options in the game, the child gave different answers to the same question. It changed moment by moment and grew day by day. The more I met her, the more lovely Helena felt. In the end, I became attached to her.And\u2026\u2026 in fact, it was more terrifying than anything else. I was afraid to die. Until now, I had no problem with dying thanks to the blind belief that this would be a \u2018dream\u2019.I thought that if I died without any reason, I would be able to return to \u2018me\u2019. Death here was never death\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Because in all the stories I had read, that was usually the case.However, as I spent more time here, my anxiety grew.What if that was not it? What if the witch lied to me? I killed Helena and was executed\u2026\u2026 What if I couldn\u2019t wake up again? I couldn\u2019t breathe.I had no regrets about dying because I knew I would wake up again. The swamp of self-contradiction dragged me down from time to time.I knew it was cowardly. I also knew that I was reversing the commitment to Anakin, no, to myself, saying not to escape. But I couldn\u2019t stand it.My family passed by in front of my eyes. Everything I left in my world was asking me. Are you sure you don\u2019t have to come back? Can you live someone else\u2019s life with someone else\u2019s face? Are you confident that you won\u2019t regret it if you don\u2019t see it again?Ah, I remembered my mom\u2019s face. I also heard my mother\u2019s voice being disappointed, asking how I never contacted her.I wanted to scream. No, I didn\u2019t know if maybe I had buried my face in a pillow and screamed. Because I was half out of my mind and rolling on the bed tearing my hair off.Mom, look at me. Mom, your daughter is trying like this. I am so tired. I miss my mom\u2026\u2026 I really miss you!It was too far to go home\u2026\u2026. I couldn\u2019t go any further because it was so far away.I gasped for a long time. My curled body gradually stretched out. Anakin. When I called his name, he came up to me. I didn\u2019t say anything, but he covered my eyes without saying anything.I could cry for a moment under his hard hands. When I finally stopped crying, I quietly ordered him.\u201cPack up, Anakin.\u201dAnakin silently packed my luggage at my words without even asking the common question of where he was going. He shoved any clothes into my luggage and collected gold at random. Anakin jumped out of the window first and then caught me falling.The magic train was stopped after being suspected of stability, so I had to ride a horse or carriage. Anakin secretly bought a horseman through Cynthia.\u201cAre you Anakin?\u201d I\u2019ve been waiting.\u201dThe horseman guided us straight behind the carriage without asking anything. There were so many large boxes, among them, I hid myself in an empty box. It was reasonable for me to enter. I was smaller in size, but more noticeable in appearance than Anakin.\u201cPlease bear with me even if it\u2019s a little uncomfortable. I\u2019ll open it for you when I pass the watergate.\u201d\u201cWhat are the rest of the boxes? It smells bad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s trash.\u2026\u2026 The capital is so dense that there is no landfill. That\u2019s why we regularly send trash and dirt to areas outside the capital.\u201dEverywhere, the water supply was expensive. I went into the box without saying a word. Although the inside of the box was uncomfortable and smelled bad, humans were adaptable creatures, so their noses were paralyzed and bearable.The rattling wagon stopped for a moment as if it stood at a gate. The guard asked formal questions to the horseman as usual.\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The odour trapped in the box spread.\u201cDo I have to open another one? It must smell bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s done.\u201dI held back my pounding heart until the horseman closed the box and drove the wagon again. I couldn\u2019t even tell how much time had passed because I couldn\u2019t see outside and I didn\u2019t even have a wristwatch.The wagon gradually slowed down and soon stopped completely. After the coachman pulled me out, he hurriedly unlocked the link between the wagon and the horse.\u201cThat\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019ll give you a horse, so you two have to go on your own from here.\u201dWe moved our luggage onto the horse and ran nonstop to another nearby village.Under the flurry of light, two running shadows fluttered.As soon as we left the capital, chasers immediately caught up. Maybe the marquis sent them. Anakin measured the number and asked if he should kill them, saying that there were about two.\u201cNo, not yet. Since it is near the capital now, if we kill them, the Marquis, who will find it strange that no contact has been made, will send new chasers.\u201dIf we were going to kill them, we had to kill them as far away as possible. So he would misunderstand that the delay in contact was because of the far distance.Anyway, it would be all useless if we got caught before that so we had to disguise ourselves.\u00a0 And in order to confuse them as much as possible, we tried to change our appearance by changing clothes every time we visited a village.Sometimes we were siblings, sometimes newlyweds, and sometimes Anakin dressed as a woman and I dressed as a man.Anakin looked pretty good dressing up as a woman.It wasn\u2019t because he looked particularly pretty, but because he was tall, his original features were faint, so there was no incompatibility in whatever he wore.Anakin accepted however I decorated him, so it was very fun because it seemed like playing with a large doll.But we couldn\u2019t ignore the height difference between the two of us, so to overcome it as much as possible, I pretended to be Anakin\u2019s younger brother instead of wearing a clumsy mustache.The big woman and the small man sometimes caught the attention of others, but the chasers did not even suspect and thought we would hide ourselves so thoroughly.I deliberately wandered around the cheap inns. This was because the chasers judged that the picky marquis\u2019s young lady would be in a good accommodation, so they searched thoroughly in the best accommodation.The bed creaked, and the curtains smelled of dust. In addition, compared to what I ate at the marquis, the meal was terrible.But it was still good. I didn\u2019t have to imitate Eris. Now, Eris no longer had to think about what to say, what facial expressions to have and how to act.Rather, I had to try not to imitate Eris as much as possible, so gradually I was getting my way of speaking and thinking back. I felt like I was doing rehabilitation training.We discussed again and again about what to do next in our spare time. At first, I taught writing, and then Anakin asked to become a hunter and make money.The writing might be different from the empire, but\u2026\u2026 I felt groundless confidence that I would learn soon.Just in case I couldn\u2019t learn to write and Anakin wasn\u2019t good at hunting, there was also a plan that if Anakin knitted, I would sell it.No, I thought it would not be bad to work in the field or help with the inn for a while. Anakin was more physical and versatile than me, and I also had no part-time job when I was in Korea.That way, when seed money was collected, I could buy an instrument and get paid after I went out on the street and played it. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to achieve my dreams here that I couldn\u2019t achieve in Korea.I would watch the stars at night. Anakin said he could tell me all the constellations that appear in all four seasons. During the day, I wanted to learn this world anew under the sun.Since I decided to stay, everything looked different. It would definitely be fun. Maybe it would be a life with nothing more to ask for.We headed north without hesitation. What existed in the north was the so-called \u2018land of barbarians\u2019, and it was said that it was still a country that strongly believed in witches and magic.It was also a country that signed a nonaggression treaty after a long war with the empire, so if we crossed the border, it would have been impossible for the marquis to chase us, no matter how much he tried.Since it was a country that believed in witches, I thought I should sell Medea\u2019s name if I could. The contract to send me back had been broken, so I couldn\u2019t ask her for help anymore.\u2026.She was not going to kill me for selling her name. I was not afraid at all if a witch would harm me, but I was afraid that Anakin would be disappointed in me.What on earth do you think about running away with me? I couldn\u2019t promise you anything now, but there would be no more \u2018mainstream\u2019 in our future. Why did you agree and accept it casually?Watching Anakin\u2019s profile as he disposed of the chaser\u2019s body, I hoped Anakin would convince me of why he was so blind.Yeah, I hoped it was a very common and clich\u00e9 reason. You eventually fell in love with me. You wanted to hold my hand, and you wanted to run away forever, it was not just me\u2026\u2026 I dared to ask you to say so.I wonder, how far have I strayed from the story? So far, I know the ending and development of this story, so I tried not to deviate too much from it. Yes, that was why I killed the crown prince and turned back time.Knowing the future had more advantages than I thought, and I now had to give up all of them. This was because I had never read about what happened to \u2018Eris Mis\u00e9rian,\u2019 which was out of the story.Little by little the further away from the capital city I got, the more the law of causality was pulling me. The wheel of the wagon suddenly broke, or the horse untied the rope and ran away.Even in disguise, there was a time when we caught a person who tried to report us. After burning the correspondence while thinking about killing him, we threatened to kill all of his family and released him.I knew that there would be no future troubles only if we killed him, but I didn\u2019t want to see blood.The village near the border, which we arrived at after many twists and turns, was as quiet as all rural villages.Since it was like an alpine area, it was not suitable to do agriculture, so the entire village seemed to make money by offering people across the border a place to sleep and feeding them.Perhaps because it was winter, the border door was closed by a short margin.I tried to convince him with a bribe, but it quickly got dark, and because the next village was a little far away, it was said that there were many cases where people often died after not being able to withstand the drop in temperatures and the wild animals while crossing the hill at night.I didn\u2019t want to be suspected if I kept insisting to the person shaking his head, saying that he hated removing corpses during this winter. As soon as the sun rose tomorrow, we decided to cross the border and get accommodation.We killed the chaser and had to wake up early in the morning, but I didn\u2019t want to spend the last day at a cheap inn. In order to make a move early tomorrow, I hoped it was a place where the bed didn\u2019t smell like dust and there were less creaking sounds.In the end, the price was much higher than the usual accommodation, but I took a room at a moderately neat and well-equipped inn and unpacked.I looked around the quiet village and entered a nearby store. It was embarrassingly shabby and old compared to the capital\u2019s dessert store, Launte, but it was also a perfect place for travelers who had to hurry to cross the border to relax their feet for a while.When I ordered drinks and refreshments to eat briefly and watched people outside the window, I remembered when I went to see Metheus.There were twists and turns, but I had a lot of fun until Jason intervened.We watched a play together with a lot of food in our hands.\u2026.Come to think of it, Anakin said he was curious about me. In response, I brought up first \u2018my story\u2019 and then lastly, \u2018my family story\u2019, to be exact.Oh, and I think I told him once more about my past when we lived together in a separate house.It wasn\u2019t a big deal. When people had nothing to talk about, they would usually bring up their school days. In fact, Anakin never went to school, so he wouldn\u2019t have understood half of my story.In fact, that was why I didn\u2019t really want to talk to Anakin about what kind of life I had lived.This was because it was not a pleasant life for others to hear, and there were many things that were difficult for Anakin to imagine because the world in which he lived was literally different.Rather than a meaningless past, I wanted to talk about the present we were in together and the future where we wanted to be together. If I was to tell him about myself, I wanted to show myself who changed because of him rather than the me in Korea he didn\u2019t know.After I said that, I bit my lip. It was the same as trying to wrap it up somehow. Let\u2019s be honest. I was afraid that Anakin would be disappointed in me.My normal face, not the beautiful Eris. I pretended to be strong, but in reality, my personality was full of inferiority. I was afraid that Anakin, who had been my support so far, would no longer want me to be his master, because I was afraid that the past times that I had been miserable rather than wealthy like Eris would be revealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I decided to stay here. I bit my lip, and Anakin, who was staring at the drink in front of me, lifted his head and shook it slowly.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have any other choice. However, even if I had a choice, nothing would have changed.\u201dAnakin took a sip of the drink in front of him and swallowed it.\u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to even have a name that everyone has. I could have named myself like Kynthia if I wanted to.\u201dDo\u2026. not feel the need.(TL/N: she purposely paused in between, that word is sinking in her mind.)Somehow Anakin looked a lot like Eris\u2019 mother, Quies Mis\u00e9rian. Wanting nothing, not interested in anything.Maybe that was why the two people in the story got closer. It was said that Eris was suffering from her mother\u2019s absence and felt lonely.He was so blank because he was a supporting role for Eris? If he was in Helena\u2019s supporting roles, would the writer have set him in more detail than he was now?When I kept my mouth shut with one thought or another, Anakin soon put his glass down and smiled a little.Light eyes stared straight at me.I wanted to kiss the corner of his faintly rising mouth. Even if we were not in the ballroom, would you accept me?\u201c\u2026I think it was a good thing I didn\u2019t name myself. I like the name my master gave me.\u201dIf we hadn\u2019t met here\u2026\u2026 Just like any other love, I was introduced to you in Korea, at school, and in a very ordinary way\u2026\u2026 If we met like that, would we still fall in love?The answer came out easier than I thought. You were still wearing the necklace I gave you.No matter how much life was a series of regrets, we all lived in pain by holding onto the assumption of what-ifs, but it seemed to have gotten particularly serious when I entered this novel.I guess not returning to the dorm right after leaving the store was the source of all troubles. Would it have been different if I hadn\u2019t asked to walk for a while because the streets at night were so pretty?No, when I think about it now, the damn causality must have worked. Otherwise, I couldn\u2019t have known that I would suddenly hear about Helena from a flower shop where I jokingly stopped by, asking Anakin to buy me a flower.No, no. It was all an excuse. Actually, I just wanted to go back. When the sun rose and the gates opened, it was ridiculous to say that I had changed my mind at the very threshold of crossing the line. But I couldn\u2019t help it.I was taught to push myself. Because there was no one to replace me. I even said with my own mouth that I didn\u2019t need her feelings. Honestly, I felt complacent because it was a good position to be in.(PR/N: \u2018her\u2019 as in Helena.)It was a position called crown princess, who would become the Empress later. Marrying a childhood friend, a handsome prince in a fairy tale, was not a bad opportunity in her life as a maid.It came true in the novel I read anyway. I concluded at my disposal that I was only helping her.So I never really asked her. Was it okay for her to marry the prince?\u00a0 No, it wasn\u2019t good enough. Did she want to marry him?It kept bothering me that I haven\u2019t heard the answer. No, maybe that crying face caught my heart.No, no\u2026. I had already seen her cry. At Eris\u2019s Coming of Age ceremony, I even told Helena, who was squeezing her head with a wet face over something that was not her fault, that it was okay to cry.Come to think of it, she was still young.I was just about to attend college. If I had heard that a person of that age was getting married in Korea, I would have probably fainted.I knew this was crazy.It was also absurd to apply Korean standards to this world. If someone saw me, they might think that I was being noisy belatedly.However, if I went back to Helena and asked her intention, and if she said no\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026I would have to break her marriage.I couldn\u2019t make her unhappy even if it was for me.I slowly lowered my hand while smelling the scent of wrapped flowers. I put the back of my hand that wasn\u2019t holding a flower to my forehead, laughed and asked Anakin in vain while picking up a stalk.\u201cI\u2019m sure we could have lived happily ever after. Right?\u201dDespite my sudden question, Anakin did not ask back why. He just looked down at me and nodded coolly. A faint smile caught his mouth.Oh, it was at that time. It was my favorite appearance. In fact, there was nothing I didn\u2019t like.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure we would have been happy.\u201dFutures that could have been achieved, but have not been achieved, passed by my eyes.I would become a teacher and he would become a hunter, getting by day by day. Making money by knitting and working at an inn\u2026\u2026. The timeline where I would play musical instruments, study constellations, sell Medea\u2019s name, and pretend to be a witch.\u2026\u2026.Someday, there might be a day when I would regret making this decision.But somehow I was convinced that there would be a happier future than the ones I just lost.\u201cWe\u2019ll be happy.\u201dEven if we didn\u2019t run away, we would be happy.***Since there was no need to use my brain by running away, the way back to the capital was naturally faster than when I ran out. Still, it was two days before the wedding because the distance was so far away.The whole capital was noisy preparing for the wedding.Of course, flowers and white cloths were waving on every street, and it was very crowded with each party celebrating the crown prince\u2019s wedding.Yes, the wedding of Helena and the Crown Prince was a major event described by increasing the number of chapters, so it was understandable.The problem was that I couldn\u2019t enter the imperial palace. Since my status as the fiance has disappeared, I was in a position where I could not enter unless the imperial family called me.When it came to sneaking in, the security was tighter than ever.\u00a0 I even thought about using the underground passage, but now that the Marquis had been dismissed from his post, it was in vain.In the original, I didn\u2019t know how Eris entered the palace. Or since it was the wedding day, did she enter in the middle of a hectic time?Anyway, it would be late on the day. No matter how much I thought about it, I was not confident in breaking into the wedding hall and shouting, \u2018This marriage is invalid.\u2019I had no choice but to think of a person\u2019s face while biting my fingernails.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to run away?\u201d\u201cWell, that happened somehow.\u201dWhen I knocked on the familiar wooden door, Medea looked down at me sternly. To be honest, I avoided looking at her because I was the one who was stabbed. Medea, who was looking at me, sighed and soon stepped aside.\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and talk. Come on in.\u201dAs I sat on her couch, savouring the willfully tasteless tea that Medea had brewed, I hesitated and opened my mouth. I explained the situation first. The story of how I escaped, went to the border, and then returned.\u2026\u2026I also talked about why I had no choice but to run away. Because I had to persuade Medea.\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cI want to talk to Helena.\u201d\u201cYou must think of me as a peddler or troubleshooter?\u201dUgh, she was angry. Well, whenever I did something, I was looking for Medea, it couldn\u2019t have looked good from her point of view. Anyway, it was me who was disappointed, so I rolled my eyes and spoke in a voice like an ant\u2019s.\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d\u201cWhatever you ask for.\u201d\u201cYou should be brave. What do you think I\u2019m going to ask you for?\u201dNo, why do you keep talking in circles?I\u2019m running out of time! Honestly, I knew it was my fault and she was upset, but I suddenly got annoyed. I jumped up, looked down at her, and grinded my teeth.\u201cI\u2019m going to handle it. Why are you so talkative?\u201d\u201cEven if I tell you to stay in this world?\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThe absurd question made me laugh automatically.\u201cYou have to ask for a price that fits my condition. Why else would I come to you? I\u2019ll just run into the Imperial Palace pretending to be crazy. And if I stay in this world, do you think I\u2019ll be fine?\u201dKynthia still liked me better. If he had to choose between the two of us, who would he choose?\u201cI\u2019ll definitely mess up your next plan, so take care of it.\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cStill\u2026.. I\u2019m asking for a favour.\u201dMedea looked up at me for a moment and smiled brightly. She reached out and grabbed my neck once. As if to gauge whether it could be broken. But soon she got up and headed to the full-body mirror in the corner.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s meet.\u201dShe asked me to look straight in the mirror and keep imagining the face I wanted to see.I had to feel like I was making eye contact with her. That was easy to say, honestly, it was very difficult for me who was unfamiliar with magic.However, as a result of closing my eyes and trying to concentrate, Helena\u2019s appearance was clearly shining in the mirror when I opened my eyes.Whether she was preparing for marriage or not, she was not dressed as a maid. To Helena, who was embarrassed, I brought up the main topic without talking about this or that.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian! Where in the world have you been\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, say no.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you want to run away, tell me you want to run away.\u201dI looked her in the eye and said just that.I didn\u2019t bring up anything more than that.Anyway, she would know what I was talking about even without stating the subject.\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you run away no matter what I do.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The more I learn, the more I know what I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cNow that I know it, I have something I want to do for the first time. And\u2026 I can do it if I sit here.\u201dHelena straightened her back.The fact that it was me who wanted to run away, not Helena\u2026\u2026 I realized it again.Did I want to run away from her and feel vicarious satisfaction? A bitter smile lingered around my mouth.Helena looked different again. I had hated Helena since I first read the novel. Because it wasn\u2019t my favourite personality. She was indecisive, dull, overly optimistic, nosy and incompetent.There was a truth that I learned only after entering this world and after constantly bumping into her. A person\u2019s personality was the same as two sides, so the pros and cons could be different depending on how someone interpreted it.Helena was not indecisive, but cautious. She was dull, but she sympathised with the joy or sadness of others faster than anyone else. Being overly optimistic meant that one always tried to move forward positively without giving up easily even in difficult situations, and being nosy meant that one was good and interested in their surroundings.And incompetence. Come to think of it, what did ability mean? Being able to read and write? Knowing the etiquette of the imperial palace? Having fashion sense? Or political sense? All of these were abilities that Helena, who was born and lived as a maid, did not need to have.She didn\u2019t learn because she didn\u2019t need to. Even if she tried to take a certification test, learning must precede, or if I disparaged her as incompetent just because she didn\u2019t know, that would have been unfair.Helena Antebellum was\u2026\u2026 She just didn\u2019t have a chance, and now she got it back.The opportunity I had barely earned was in vain, I didn\u2019t deserve to have it.\u201cWill you come to my wedding?\u201dHelena smiled shyly. When I saw that smile, I was rather ashamed of myself running away to the end of the earth.We each had our own work to do. She took the first step, but I couldn\u2019t back down. My shaken mind hardened fast.Even if I didn\u2019t kill her, Helena would become the crown princess. She was a lovable person and she would live in peace in her surroundings, just as she had always been.Alecto would take care of her on his own, even if political opponents might frame her or rebel against what she did.But if I killed Helena, and if Hubris saved her again, people would think that the new crown princess, or the empress, had been blessed by God. And they would believe that those who want to harm the \u2018God-blessed Empress\u2019 were absolute evils.Religion would have a great influence on this country, and miracles would instill strong awareness in people.Then whatever Helena did, it would become difficult to rebel against her politically. If I was going to give her strength, I had better make sure. It was the original story, so it was much safer.The calculator, which had been tapping quickly in my head, stopped. I laughed at myself. Perhaps this was why Helena felt sorry. People usually craved what they didn\u2019t have.\u201cI\u2019ll go. Instead\u2026 I want to meet you alone. People might think it\u2019s strange.\u201dWill you let me in? At my question, Helena smiled brightly and nodded.The day after tomorrow, her wedding will be held.I had to kill her that day for a happy ending that everyone wanted.* * *It was a morning that matched the expression of being truly blessed, with white clouds blooming beautifully in the clean and blue sky.I breathed in the clear and cold air to the fullest. Perhaps Helena and Alecto were going to the temple and being blessed.I chose the right casual clothes and wore a black veil. Anyways, it was my ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, so there was nothing good about standing out.When I was ready to go out, the maid looked at me with worried eyes.\u201cLady\u2026\u201dIf I went out now, I could never come back. Perhaps that was why the usual greeting of going didn\u2019t come out of my mouth easily. It was just a formality anyway, so it was okay if I spat out lies or anything.\u2026.That was probably because she didn\u2019t treat me formally. Emma had always been faithful to me, so I could last a little longer in this strange world.\u201cThank you always.\u201dSo I decided not to lie too. Anakin followed me when I hurried out of the room for fear of lingering feelings.I stopped him with a gesture. In case of an emergency, I thought it would be better to keep Anakin hidden as the secret weapon.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something else you have to do for me. I\u2019ll let you know when the time comes.\u201d\u201cThen take a mirror with you.\u201dI took the mirror and looked at my face for a while.\u00a0 I was sorry to Eris, but now it was time to say goodbye to her as well.Of course, the wedding was not something that could be seen just because one wanted to see it because only the aristocrats, especially the high-ranking aristocrats and the imperial family, could enter and watch it. Therefore, it was a principle to have a street parade on the street for the common people when the crown prince or emperor got married.This was also what the imperial family worked the most on at the wedding. Since there were so many people and it progressed slowly because of people, there were more threats of assassination than ever. According to records, some people must have really died.Nevertheless, the reason why it did not stop was because it was good for recovering public sentiment, and there was no other way to revitalize the stagnant social atmosphere or economy.There were even rumors that the weather would change for the street parade, so that said everything.Perhaps the crown prince or Helena were wearing artifacts just in case. In addition, the knights and magic engineers would be standing guard in each area.Perhaps I stood in the right alley and measured where the guards might be hiding.Each person was excited and had flowers in their hands. It was clear that they would probably throw them as hard as they could when the procession passed.It was said that the magic engineers who were at the forefront of the procession were constantly shooting sparkles through magic tools, so it was a sight that would be eye-catching even if you didn\u2019t see it.I heard cheers from far away. The sound was getting louder and louder, and it seemed like a tsunami was coming.My hands were a little sweaty, so I wiped them off my skirt and caught my breath. Everyone was shouting congratulations. They said that they wanted to live happily ever after, and that they loved each other.Finally, Helena appeared, waving at people and smiling among the pouring light and flowers.Her dazzling silver hair was decorated with polished orange branches, and a sheer veil was hanging at the end. The white empire dress which was delicately embroidered with gold thread, looked very good on her.May your daydreams of twilight be ever so radiant.But why did I keep..\u2026 I didn\u2019t know if I could imagine Eris\u2019 wedding. Eris\u2019 wedding must have been beautiful.Was she blessed like this? With very few exceptions, Eris, who left after being hated by the world\u2026\u2026 Did she only show her sincere smile that day?At that moment, would she have thought that life was really dazzling and that she was lucky to be born?* * *I think I knew why the original Eris chose this day. The imperial palace was simply a mess. When hiding in the back garden of the imperial palace, no one noticed me, unlike usual. No, maybe the causality was helping me.Eris said she hid in a \u2018new room\u2019. Where was the new room in this imperial palace? It wouldn\u2019t be the crown prince\u2019s existing bedroom. He wouldn\u2019t have been given a new room separate from the palace.It must have been inside the Imperial Palace, but the building called the Imperial Palace was also quite large.I couldn\u2019t ask anyone, so I had to guess it well with my gut. If I could, I thought about just opening the door in each room and checking it.Since all the people in the palace were transferred and busy preparing for the wedding and reception that followed, only the minimum number of people remained.The room with a small door was out of the list. The crown prince and his wife slept well in the bedroom, but of course it would be a large bedroom. Also out of the list if it was near the stairs too. It was a newlywed bedroom, but was it in a place where people came and went? In the same sense, the first floor was also out.After erasing it roughly, there were actually few bedrooms to check.I thought they would not have sprinkled roses on the bed, but even though there were no roses, the flowers and branches of the linden tree were beautifully decorated on the bed. There was nowhere else to sit, so I sat on the bed and waited for Helena.At this rate, it was clear that it would be a setback if the crown prince came in first, but for now, I decided not to believe in the novel and hide. The knife hidden in my arms felt heavy. When Helena comes in\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll have to kill Helena with that knife.What if she resisted? Would I be able to win by a difference in power? What if she screamed and ran away as soon as she saw the knife? It might be faster for the people who came running after hearing her scream to catch me than for me to catch her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t even tell how hard I had to stab. As time went by, my stomach hurt because of the tension.Could it be that I found the wrong room? I was thinking about whether I should get up now and go to another room.The door opened, and Helena in a white gown entered the room and met my eyes. Without a sign of surprise, she said something to the attendant behind her door, and she took the teapot and teacup herself.When the door closed, she asked me in a small voice.\u201cDo you want a cup of tea?\u201dWhen I looked at the door, Helena smiled and reassured me.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No one will come for a while.\u201dShe was so calm,\u00a0 I felt uncomfortable because she was so calm. Something was out of the ordinary. Come to think of it, why wasn\u2019t Helena surprised when she saw my reflection in the mirror?\u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us.\u201dHelena\u2019s purple eyes\u2026\u2026 stood out.* * *Helena Antebellum was a child who could not doubt anyone. Although she was slow-tempered, she always tended to ignore\u00a0 her intuition, saying it was just a feeling.Helena believed that all humans were good inside, and thought it was bad to doubt others carelessly.One might wander around, but if she showed consistent trust and affection, they would eventually return to their good nature. So she didn\u2019t notice that Eris Mis\u00e9rian had changed somehow. Growth was always like that.So when she found out that \u2018Eris\u2019 wasn\u2019t herself, she was quite indifferent to her.\u2026 No, she was actually very disillusioned.Because of the call, she was on her way to the empress. She saw Eris and Alecto talking from afar. She was worried about whether they were fighting, so she walked faster. Eris grabbed Alecto\u2019s two cheeks and brought his face close.Helena hid herself behind the pillar without realizing it. This was because there was no way to avoid the embarrassment if they made eye contact.But she couldn\u2019t hear a kiss. Doubtfully, Helena slightly raised her head again. Eris quietly began to talk.When her voice rose, she almost ran out to stop them, but somehow she had a very strong feeling that she shouldn\u2019t be caught.Some gravity was holding her ankle and holding her right behind the pillar.So that she couldn\u2019t move a single step.So Helena had no choice but to listen.\u201cHey, guess who I am.\u201dHelena, who hid herself behind the pillar, stopped breathing. She could have suspected it was a lie, but somehow the bell in her head rang loudly and shouted that it was true.Her heart sank and she felt dizzy. She couldn\u2019t believe that the one she had met so far wasn\u2019t Eris.Helena dared to think she knew her well. Now she realized that it was terrible arrogance.\u201cIf you\u2019re not Eris, where is the child?\u201d\u201cShe is dead. No, she\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\u2013 I hate you. I wish people like you would die.One day, the sight of her crying and staring at her penetrated Helena\u2019s heart.\u2013 Without you, I wouldn\u2019t have been so hated.Even after the woman in the form of Eris disappeared, Helena could not move her feet for a long time.Why didn\u2019t she notice? Where did she change from? She was going through her memory, nailed to the spot.Helena had a lot of affection. Some even expressed that it was too much. She used to give her heart easily in such a short time, so the day would come when she would get hurt.But contrary to what they thought, she was not hurt. Rather, it was the people around her who were hurt.Helena was just warm-hearted, but they used to misunderstand it. To this dazzling person, they were so flattered that she was a special being and that she was different from others. Furthermore, no matter what the beginning was, in the end, everyone wanted Helena to receive as much love as they had given her.Funny, even though she had never asked for love. It didn\u2019t take long for the illusion to break. Because she could tell just by looking at the way others talked and looked at her.She thought it was special.When the full illusion was broken, people accused Helena of holding and shaking their hearts. She was ashamed. They turned their arrows to Helena because they wanted to hide their shame. It was a bad thing for her to make them misunderstand. She shouldn\u2019t have given them a chance.In fact, Helena was not resentful or upset even though it was an argument that was tantamount to nothing. She didn\u2019t even regret that she cared for them.She was just sorry that they didn\u2019t feel the same way. Looking at Helena, those who criticised Helena used to feel ashamed. It had always been like that.For her, Alecto and Jason were special beings as \u2018friends\u2019. At least they didn\u2019t blame her. Helena wanted to keep this relationship as long as possible. And there was only one person who didn\u2019t like it.\u2013 His Highness is so kind to you. Do you think you\u2019re a noble? Or do you dare to raise your status as the subject of a traitor\u2019s family?People could hate someone this much. Since Helena\u2019s nature was far from hatred, Helena realized that hatred could make people more sick than expected only after seeing Eris. But somehow Helena didn\u2019t hate Eris.Rather, she thought that consistent Eris was better than people who always changed their minds. She even had a strange trust that even if everyone betrayed her, they wouldn\u2019t do as much as Eris.Standing in front of Eris, at least Helena didn\u2019t have to worry about whether she had created an \u2018illusion\u2019.She wouldn\u2019t change as much as she did. She would always\u2026..She never thought Alecto liked her. First of all, they had a huge difference in status and they had been with each other since childhood.(TL/N: she is implying that their relationship was more like \u2018siblings\u2019.)Others thought that Alecto treated Helena in a special way, but they only thought it was special treatment as a \u2018close friend\u2019 because he had only a few people to share his heart with.On the night Alecto confessed to her, the moon was bigger than ever, and the back garden shone as white as the day.She remembered Alecto\u2019s trembling voice.The face, which was carefully and politely asking for her intention, was slightly red with tension and excitement.Only then did Helena realize that Alecto really liked her. Because it was a familiar face. When Eris saw Alecto, she always used to look like that.Helena liked Alecto too. However, when asked if she was confident in liking him as a lover, she could not answer.Having been together for so long, Alecto had been a part of Helena\u2019s life. She couldn\u2019t imagine that they wouldn\u2019t be able to meet even if the day came when she got married and left the palace someday.A being who believed that they would be together until the end of their lives. Could she have had that kind of trust because she loved Alecto? Helena was\u2026. she was confused.Eris asked her to try liking Alecto if she had no other favourite person. While she liked Alecto more than anyone else. After having trampled on his childhood, saying they were dating, Eris calmly declared that she was tired of Alecto.She even actively helped put her next to Alecto, perhaps it was not enough to declare it.She held Helena\u2019s hand, taught her, and carefully cared for her. Everyone who knew Lady Mis\u00e9rian would not believe it.\u201cYou can change your mind. You have the right and power to do that.\u201dHelena Antebellum always lived compliant and resigned. Because she had no other way. No matter how rough things were, she laughed, did not tell anything, and pretended not to know even if she knew.The girl who made her feel that more deeply than anyone else was now trying to show her a new path.\u201cIf you\u2019re sad, learn. I\u2019ll help you gain strength by raising your status.\u201dAs Eris said, if you learn and gain strength\u2026\u2026 What would be different?\u201cKeep in mind that once you have power, you can carry out your will whether you take revenge on me or deny your situation.\u201dCould she finally hate or like without getting permission from someone?Learning something was very exhausting, but it was fun. It was interesting when she\u00a0 learned letters, manners and dance from Eris, but when the \u2018teacher\u2019 taught her history, society and politics, she felt like she was opening her eyes completely.So far, Helena\u2019s world had been all about the imperial palace. Sometimes, she would listen to the situation in the capital from Hubris, a new official she was close to, or about adventures from Jason.However, it was just a fragmentary event, so she couldn\u2019t understand why such an event occurred at all.Since she was black eyed and didn\u2019t know how to write, she couldn\u2019t read books or newspapers even if they came into her hands for the first time in a long time. In short, there was no background knowledge.(PR/N: \u2018black eyed\u2019 means an ignorant person who can\u2019t read.)She heard from Hubris that there were many orphans in the capital, but she didn\u2019t know why there were many orphans. She heard that Jason had experience in the guild as a mercenary, but she didn\u2019t know why the mercenary industry was particularly developed in the empire.Due to the Magic War before she was born, the state encouraged mercenary businesses to fight off evil. This mercenary business grew rapidly based on the orphans created by the Magic War, as orphans who did not have a family business could easily do it.However, the mercenary industry was both a light and shadow for orphans, as the survival rate of mercenaries was only 60 percent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Kill The VillainessCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 81: Not OkayDue to the nature of the industry of mercenaries, they were mainly in charge of dangerous tasks that others were reluctant to do, and the lower class of society became mercenaries because they had nothing else to do, and when they ended up crippled, they became beggars.Helena, who thought mercenaries were romantic professions after hearing only Jason\u2019s story\u2026\u2026was greatly shocked by that fact.Wasn\u2019t that the same as exploiting people who didn\u2019t have something to lose? Some might call it social providence, just as natural as water flowing from the top to the bottom.(PR/N: social providence; principles and laws governing the natural world.)However, Helena thought that those who were left out should also be given a choice. Just as she was given a path other than a maid, they must have a path other than mercenaries.In order for such a path to exist, the approval of a \u2018higher person\u2019 with wealth and power was essential.If she became the crown princess, and even the empress, it could have been enough to achieve it.Helena woke up from her thoughts. Maybe she wasn\u2019t Eris from the time she called her Lady Antebellum without hesitation. She used to use that name reluctantly.It was only misjudgment and arrogance that she thought they could finally be friends.Eventually, Eris hated her until the end. They didn\u2019t have any other future from the beginning. When she realised that, why were tears and laughter coming at the same time?As Helena Antebellum wished, Eris Mis\u00e9rian remained unchanged. She just seemed to have changed because she was a different person. No, it was rather Helena who had changed.Helena looked at herself in the mirror in front of the Empress\u2019 Palace. Her glossy hair was now always neatly arranged. Her facial expressions, tone, and even posture have changed beyond recognition. What she was wearing was not a maid\u2019s uniform, but a neat dress made of high-quality fabric.Spring rain poured down. Strangely enough, it was not outside, but only under the roof, it was pooled under her feet. Would it, perhaps, be for the best? She would never meet her again, and the woman in her body.\u2026.Helena thought, thought and thought, and finally remembered her oath from an early summer day.Even if there was no future for Eris, even if all of this was only a little sympathy for her.Helena Antebellum decided not to run away anymore.* * *One side of my chest sank coldly. Did Helena notice something? I held my breath and looked outside.However, perhaps because it was the honeymoon room, nothing was heard because it was soundproof. I didn\u2019t know if the sound of footsteps or words was not heard at all because there were really no people around or because of the soundproofing.I swallowed my saliva once. I couldn\u2019t show it, so I looked at the teacup silently with no expression. If I made eye contact, I felt like I would get caught. Helena looked at my gaze and followed it to the tea. It was still a warm steamy herbal tea.I wanted to cool down my dry throat, but I was scared that the glass would shake. I blinked for a moment and asked Helena.\u201cWhat about Alecto?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s originally a tradition for the groom to see off the guests until the end. He told me to go to bed first because he won\u2019t be here until dawn.\u201dThen, as she said, there was really time to spare. Only then did I pick up the teacup. I still wet my lips slowly with the warm tea.Helena waited for me silently. What should I say? As long as I entered this palace anyway, I had no intention of escaping alive.Should I say a conventional greeting to congratulate their marriage? But even that was not enough. Because I didn\u2019t really want to bless their marriage. When I couldn\u2019t easily rush the first words, Helena spoke up first.\u201cI heard you went to a far\u2026. away place. Did you enjoy your trip?\u201d\u201cTravelling? It\u2019s okay to say a night escape. It was a night escape.\u201dEven with my sharp tone, Helena only smiled softly. I clicked my tongue when I saw that. People shouldn\u2019t just be soft like that.When I thought of the tenacity that Helena showed when she slapped the maid, I didn\u2019t think she would be swayed by others, but sometimes generosity caused anger.She suddenly turned her head at a bird\u2019s cry, fixed her gaze out the window, and said,\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been out of this capital in my life. Sometimes I went out with permission, but all I could do was always hover around the Imperial Palace.\u201dShe looked back at me and took a sip of tea.\u201cSo I thought I would like to travel if I quit my maid\u2019s job someday. Going far away\u2026\u2026 I wanted to see and experience a completely different world from this capital.\u201d\u201cTravel is not as romantic as you think.\u201dThe empire was on the very good side of security. Even in such an empire, the risk increased right away as it got closer to the border. Therefore, there were many cases where people were robbed or kidnapped and sold for human trafficking if they were not accompanied by an escort with considerable skills.Moreover, if there was a woman with a noticeable appearance like Helena\u2019s\u2026\u2026. There was also a strong possibility of a \u2018human hunter\u2019 being attached, who specialised in human trafficking. She smiled bitterly when she heard me.\u201cI know. It\u2019s a false dream for me.\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut, I wanted to see the sea too.\u201dBoom. Somehow, my heart sank at the words. The humble words of missing the sea filled my lungs. The sea\u2026 I was wondering. I couldn\u2019t breathe. Because I knew that her wish couldn\u2019t be fulfilled.The sea was so far from the empire which never got along with the Genyuin Kingdom, where the sea was.Alecto took Helena to a lake as large as the Dead Sea, but it was only a lake, since it was not the sea, it would not have given the same impression.She couldn\u2019t see the sea until she died. It was not like there were no people in the world who died without seeing the sea once, but why did that sentence make a person sentimental? That was probably because I had seen the sea.The sea under the bright sun, the sea with golden waves, the serene and beautiful night sea\u2026\u2026.Those who had heard the sound of the sea breathing once had no choice but to fall in love with the sea. Because the sea was the origin of human beings, or all living things on Earth, I\u2026\u2026 was it okay to be deprived of the opportunity?For me, did I deserve it?\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian?\u201dThe sound of Helena\u2019s call suddenly awoke me from thoughts. I thought I was quite firm, but why was I going back and forth these days? I already knew the reason.I\u2026 I was going crazy. The wounds left in the soul, whether self-contained or unintentional, festered and left me with a laceration.I couldn\u2019t get weak now. It was already the limit. If I failed again this time, if I woke up in this world again, I might beg the witch to kill me so I didn\u2019t wake up again because it was okay if I couldn\u2019t go back to my world.I repeated to myself. Helena was nothing. She was just a character in a novel. Hubris would save her again. This was all a planned narrative, and it couldn\u2019t be helped\u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026\u2026.\u2014 You really couldn\u2019t help it?A voice rang in my head. It was the voice of Eris. She sat close to my ear and said in a mocking voice.\u2014 Hypocrite. You didn\u2019t even think about looking for another future.It was noisy. I tried to shake off the voice. My stomach started to ache. I had done enough. I gave her a chance. If she wanted to run away, she could have run away. Helena said she would stay.\u2014 You were relieved when she said she\u2019d stay. What were you going to do if she really wanted to run away and there was no solution? Were you going to get married instead of her?\u201cI\u2019ll bring the doctor.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dHelena on the opposite side looked at my face and grabbed me with trembling hands as I tried to stand up. If my arms were searched in an examination, I would get caught with a knife. Then everything would be over.She saw the shaking of my hand and put her hand on it. Even her hands were warm. It was always like that.\u2014 See? You\u2019re just like other people. You only think about using her kindness.Only a ringing sound could be heard clearly even if I covered my ears with both hands. Shut up.What was bad about it? What was bad about doing as much as I could? Are you saying that I should save Helena?\u2014 You\u2019re not going to do anything so why do you feel guilty when you\u2019re justifying everything by saying she\u2019s just a fictional character? You\u2019re such a great person who cares about others, are you going to comfort her?\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026..I\u2019m fine.\u201dIt was a lie. None of it was fine.I had a splitting headache and a stomachache. When I couldn\u2019t stand up easily because my legs weren\u2019t tense, Helena helped me. She laid me on the bed and measured the fever with the back of her hand.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian, I think you have a fever.\u201d\u2014 Just be honest with me. The reason why you were able to pledge to kill Helena Antebellum so easily was that you could return to your world without paying for your sins.No. With my death\u2026\u2026.\u2014 You don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to pay for the crime because you\u2019re being executed, do you? You tried to kill yourself over and over again, saying it didn\u2019t matter if you died.Eris\u2019 low, gloomy voice caught my breath. No, this was not the spirit of Eris Mis\u00e9rian. It was just a dirty and disgusting shadow of myself.\u2014 More than the life line which became lighter because you thought carelessly, every breath of Helena Antebellum, who had always done her best, was a hundred times more precious.\u201cLady Miserian\u2026\u2026 Are you crying now\u2026..?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She hurriedly wiped away my tears with both hands, but the tear glands that began to burst once did not know how to subside. I moved my lips with great difficulty.The trembling voice was so breathy and terribly small that Helena had to put her ears close to my lips to listen to me.\u201c\u2026Say it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear you. Please say it one more time.\u201d\u201cI want to live\u2026\u2026 Tell me you want to live.\u201dHelena stood up silently and looked down at me.

I had already come too far, so I also knew that what I was saying now was just for my liking.(QC/N: like, saying for the sake of saying it, for her own conscience.)The sin of killing her, who wanted to live, would be condemned even if I spent the rest of my life hating and resenting myself.\u201cLady Mis\u00e9rian.

It\u2019s warm\u2026 The sun sets late.\u201dHelena closed her eyes and shook for a moment as if imagining the sight that she liked.\u201cAt that time when the wind isn\u2019t too hot\u2026 no matter where I turn my eyes, it\u2019s just dazzling.\u201dAfter finishing the unknown words, she looked back at me. She stroked my hair as if she were seeing her younger sister after a long time. And then she said,\u201cYou may not remember\u2026\u2026 One summer day I already forgave you. And I vowed that day that I would be happy to understand whatever you do to me in the future.\u201dI thought Helena Antebellum was frustrating and stupid. I felt that it was because of her weakness that she did nothing wrong while being bullied by her Eris over and over again. Because she was ignorant and weak, she was afraid of retaliation and could not think of counterattacking.It was a very arrogant and presumptuous idea.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. \u2018Yes\u2019 you told me this one day.\u201dIf it was me, if I was Helena, I would be pleasantly avenged. I would have shamed her and completely trampled on her in front of everyone so that she could never treat me carelessly again.Oh, I thought if I apologized, I would lose. I believed that revenge was \u2018stronger\u2019 because forgiveness would result in losses.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to return it. It\u2019s okay, Eris. Everything will be fine.\u201d\u201cAh, ah\u2026.! Ah!\u201d\u201cSo do what you want to do.\u201dNow I know. Helena was not holding back because she was weak. Rather, she was able to understand and embrace the pain and fear of weak people because she was stronger than anyone else. A weak wicked person could not survive without being parasitic on her kindness.\u201cAh, ah\u2026. AHHHH! AHHHHHHHH!\u201dOh, Helena. You are so dazzling that you save even low-quality humans like me.I cried and screamed. I couldn\u2019t stand the whole situation without screaming.The dagger in my arms cut through Helena, and a beam of light poured out.\u2013 Murderer.said Eris.I laid Helena on the bed as she was wet with blood. The knife given by the witch made Helena lose her breath without having to stab her several times.No matter how soundproof this place was, even so, someone must have heard it because I screamed like that.\u201cAnything, ah-\u201cThe young maid opened the door and screamed when she saw me.The footsteps of people running gradually grew louder.I agonised for a moment over a dagger in my hand. Should I hide this dagger to hand it over to the witch? But somehow the witch seemed to be able to retrieve this dagger wherever it was.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on! Heuk\u2026..\u201dIf that was the case, I would rather hold it to show that I killed her. The knight pushed in the child who collapsed and stopped breathing when he saw me. I looked at the knight quietly and opened my mouth.\u201cSay it to His Highness. I\u2019m back.\u201d* * *I was locked up in a solitary room where I had already come once before, being held by a knight. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t search separately, perhaps because I was holding the knife that killed Helena in my hand. I still needed the mirror in my pocket.How long had I been waiting, the urgent footsteps rang. In the blink of an eye, the crown prince took the key from the servant and opened the door roughly.\u201cYou dare\u2026 you dare\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf Your Highness had come earlier, she might have been able to live\u2026\u2026. Aren\u2019t you such an irresponsible new groom?\u201dHe raised his hand to slap me on the cheek, clenched his fist and trembled. The crown prince told me in a firm voice barely enduring the urge to kill.\u201cWhy did you kill her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it. Just kill me now.\u201d\u201cWhy did you kill her?\u201dIn the eyes of the crown prince who said such a thing, there was some expectation. Expectations?You still don\u2019t admit that I\u2019m not Eris? I shook my head and laughed in vain.\u201cI told you, Eris will never come back. It wasn\u2019t Eris who killed Helena.\u201dExpectations quickly turned into despair.No, his beloved woman died in the first place, but I didn\u2019t know why he reacted like that. Wasn\u2019t it right to be sad or not be able to hold back more anger?He rubbed his face with a miserable look and looked at me for a long time.It seemed as if he believed that there would be a trace of Eris in me.Funny. I would have been the one in this world who most wanted her soul to remain in Eris\u2019 body. Then everything would have been easier.The crown prince was sad about Eris\u2019 absence, but it was not because he loved her. It was just\u2026 It was close to the remnants of regret and disappointment when the object that was always next to him disappeared. Many people used to mistake possessive desire for love and become unhappy.It didn\u2019t matter that Alecto became unhappy because it was his karma, but it would be a different story if I was also involved in that unhappiness. I told him who never believed.\u201cIf you can\u2019t believe it, you can call the High Priest. The High Priests can see the soul of everyone, right? Even during that old witch hunt, he looked at the soul and distinguished it, so he can distinguish whether I\u2019m lying or not.\u201dSince Hubris noticed at once that I was a stranger, perhaps the same went for other High Priests. No, Hubris would come from the start. He blessed me during the Coming-of-Age Ceremony, and anyway, he was one of the main characters in this novel.To be honest, since I had a record of being disgraceful and mean to Hubris, I wanted him to accuse me of being a witch.The interrogator, who interrogated me last time, stood close to the crown prince staring at me with a fierce face.\u201cWhat should I do? If you allow a little torture, I can make her confess the crime within a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s nonsense.\u201dThe crown prince turned his eyes and stared fiercely at the interrogator and said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you notice that I gave her this room? No matter how much of a criminal she is, if you put a fingertip on her body, who was once a half imperial family, your life will be over.\u201d\u201cG, God, Your Highness, I didn\u2019t think much because I couldn\u2019t wait for the judgement, goodness. Please forgive me.\u201dThe interrogator who chased the crown prince leaving the room stared at me once, but I was not scared at all.Anyway, it was good that there was no torture. I was not confident in enduring the pain. I couldn\u2019t even die after biting my tongue, but there was nothing good about just being sick.Was Anakin doing well? After taking a breath, Anakin naturally came to mind. I missed him, but it was Medea not Anakin who I could communicate with through the mirror in the pocket.If that didn\u2019t happen, I would be able to see Anakin at the execution table and in the crowd as scheduled.Well, it was not \u2018Where\u2019s Wally\u2019 [1] and I had never been talented in finding hidden pictures, so I was going to ask Medea to meet him before I die. But what should I say to that face that will never be seen again?The room was cold\u2026 The problem wasn\u2019t exactly with the room. I huddled up and prayed for the morning sun to rise quickly.I thought I could see Hubris as soon as the day came, but the time was delayed a little because he had to go on a mission to a nearby area.In this novel, it was not for no reason that the only High Priest that appeared was Hubris. This was because the author initially set the setting so that Helena could only meet with Hubris.There were three high priests in the capital, except for the pope, but one of them went on a mission to another country and had not returned for a while, and the last one was elderly and was lying in bed.Since the pope, who was in critical condition, was also refusing to be treated by divine power, everyone said in unison that Hubris would become the next pope as soon as possible.Come to think of it, it seemed that it was possible for Hubris to commit a taboo to save Helena at the end of the novel because he became the pope unofficially.Because the pope was given immunity.It was because he was not in the capital city, so I hadn\u2019t heard from him yet, but if he came to know Helena was dead, he would probably run over without stopping. When Helena was taught by me, she seemed quite close to Hubris when she sometimes talked about him.Hubris came with the crown prince the next afternoon. It had been a while since I saw him, and he lost a little more weight. His decadent charm was overflowing so it was a little scary.***[1] Where\u2019s Wally? is a British series of children\u2019s puzzle books created by English illustrator Martin Handford.

We didn\u2019t know what people were doing, and we became frustrated with each other. Still, I intentionally fixed my eyes on Alecto so as to not show it. Alecto asked Hubris.\u201cAll the High Priests can see the soul of a person. Do you see it the same way?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dThe crown prince looked at me and spoke quietly.\u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9e claims that she is not Eris Mis\u00e9rian. Is what she said true? Or did she eventually go crazy?\u201dHubris looked at me when he said that.For the high priest, he didn\u2019t have to pause at all because the color of my soul was \u2018seen,\u2019 but he looked at me for a long time and smiled.The more time he took, the more anxious I became.No way. No way. I hoped my hunch would be wrong.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter finally opening his mouth, Hubris\u2019 voice was completely submerged. The deep shadow on his face made him look like a stranger. He spoke in a low, gloomy voice.\u201cThe person in front of me is Lady Mis\u00e9rian.\u201d\u201cYou crazy bastard! Don\u2019t lie!\u201dI didn\u2019t know it would come out like this because he said he would catch people. No matter how much you had been saying that you were going to save \u2018me\u2019, I didn\u2019t know you would drive me crazy.I, who was on the side of the bed, jumped out and grabbed Hubris by the neck.The crown prince grabbed my waist and pulled me away from Hubris. I tried to get away from the crown prince, but there was a wide gap in power.The crown prince closed my mouth which spat swear words at Hubris with his palm and asked. I put my teeth against his palm, but he didn\u2019t even budge to see if he received many calluses.\u201cCan you swear to God that there is no lie in that word?\u201d\u201cYes, I can swear.\u201dOh, yes. I completely forgot that Hubris had said he loved me. You call this revenge, right?When I glared fiercely at Hubris, he simply lowered his eyes, as if he was treating a young girl from an aristocratic family. My body trembled with betrayal. It couldn\u2019t be like this. It wasn\u2019t like this.\u201cIt may be presumptuous, but for a mad person, treatment should take precedence over punishment. Please have mercy.\u201d\u201cThank you, High Priest. I\u2019ll take your opinion into account.\u201dOn the subject of lying without his mouth salivating, Hubris took another step and gave an opinion to the crown prince.Treatment, that was terrible. If I was unlucky, I would go to the worst situation I have ever thought of. I had cold sweat on my back.The crown prince and Hubris went out, and the door was locked tightly again. I was gritting my teeth in anger, but I heard human footsteps again in the hallway.I thought it was Anakin, so I approached the door without realizing it, but it was not the face I wanted to see.\u201cWhy did you come back? You want to watch me go crazy and mad? Why did you lie even though you knew everything? Are you going to retaliate like this for refusing your heart?\u201d\u201cAt that time, didn\u2019t you answer it yourself, \u2018Lady Mis\u00e9rian? Since I remembered the answer back then, I just answered the same thing.\u201dThe eyes of Hubris who finally met mine were black and dead, and my words stopped spontaneously at the horror. Hubris whispered to me darkly.\u201cFrom the day the lady rejected me, I searched all the materials in the Great Shrine. As I told the lady before, there was no way to get out of this world alive.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve seen literature that says that if a stranger \u2018naturally dies\u2019, then he or she will be reborn as a member of this world.\u201dAs I stepped back terrified, Hubris smiled brightly. I got goosebumps and became distracted.\u201cDid you say that it can\u2019t be accomplished because you\u2019re trapped in my sister\u2019s body in this life? Then I will gladly wait for the next life.\u201d\u201cAre you going to look for me when I reincarnate? How are you going to recognize me?\u201dIt didn\u2019t make sense. If I was born again, even I wouldn\u2019t remember myself, but how could he wait? When I snorted, Hubris whispered quietly.\u201c\u2026The divine power is usually closely related to the previous life. This is because the divine power is not a physical realm, but the realm of the soul entirely. It is close to the water in a vessel called a human soul. The reason why the divine power is finite unlike magical power, is because, if the limit is exceeded, the vessel of the soul will be completely broken.\u201d\u201cBroken?\u201d\u201cIf it breaks, you can\u2019t be reborn again. It\u2019s a complete death\u2026. The same goes for witches. They\u2019re more like monsters than humans. They completely deviate from the orbit of life, so they can\u2019t grow old, die or be reborn.\u201dHubris closed his mouth for a moment and said as if he was organizing.\u201cEven if the owner of the vessel changes soul, the purpose may change, but the form does not change. In other words\u2026 I just want to say that I can see the color of the lady\u2019s soul in the next life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s crazy! Again\u2026 if I\u2019m reborn, I\u2019m no longer a stranger.\u201d\u201cThe color of the soul doesn\u2019t change that easily. It\u2019s deeper than the memory. There\u2019s probably a little bit of purple left.\u201dWas it because I learned too much that I didn\u2019t know at once? Or was it because I didn\u2019t want to believe it? I was very confused. I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, but Hubris didn\u2019t stop talking.\u201cOnce upon a time, there was a princess. This princess had to save the world, and she knew the way, but unfortunately it was never possible in this life of the princess. How the princess, who had no idea when she was going to be reincarnated, would have left it. Is it the same? Neither paper nor stone can wear out or be destroyed.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Get lost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of making a myth. With you and me coming out. Then it will be delivered to people. Find a lover with a purple soul\u2026\u2026. I can leave that information. So that the reincarnated me can recognize it. There may be a little distortion, but isn\u2019t every story different from the truth?\u201dHe was completely out of his mind. I couldn\u2019t think of any other words to express. I thought he was shit, but he was crazy. I was really tired, so I shook my head and whispered\u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who drove me crazy.\u201d\u201cHow dare you! Don\u2019t try to put it on me. Your disgusting feelings are my fault? You just needed someone to sympathize with and save.\u201dWhen I looked with evil eyes, Hubris stared at me silently with bloodshot eyes. But soon he turned away from me without saying much and disappeared. It was not until I confirmed that he had left completely that I could sit on the floor.What should I do? I tried to bluff, but if this continued, I might not be executed and die of old age. Even when I tried to use my brain, I couldn\u2019t think of anything. My teeth just clattered with fear.I kept wandering around the room and tried to come up with countermeasures. Originally, since Hubris returned, he had to save Helena to get it right.But seeing Hubris obsessed with me in a weird way now, I thought Helena might not be able to revive.The weather wasn\u2019t hot yet, but Helena\u2019s body might rot at this rate.When my thoughts went crazy, my breathing became short. No. I couldn\u2019t. How did this happen? Where did I go wrong?Time, time. I had to drag this on. I needed something big to drag this on\u2026\u2026. I suddenly remembered the empress.Come to think of it, the emperor and the empress were scheduled to die from the teacup the marquis had gotten. My hands were sweaty. No matter how crazy you were, you would not be able to save the traitor\u2019s daughter.In order to do that, I have to meet the empress, but I was trapped in this small room, so there was no way to meet the empress. If Anakin was next to me at times like this, I would have conveyed my words through him.Should I ask Medea for a favor? But I felt like she was going to refuse.Indeed, I\u2019ve been playing around with an universal key.When I turned my head after a rattling sound, I noticed a young attendant.(TL/N: I don\u2019t know if the young attendant is a boy or girl, the author wrote it too vaguely.)Maybe he came to put my meal down. It was a time when I traced my memory to a familiar face. Where, where did I see him?\u201cStop there!\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dI grabbed the child who was about to turn around. That child\u2026 he was a child who worked in the Empress\u2019s Palace.There was no reason for the Empress Palace\u2019s child to come to this remote tower. It was clear that the empress sent him to me. The child looked around for a moment and came back to me with a pause.\u201cD, do you have anything to say?\u201d\u201cDid your owner send you here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut the child hung close to the door and reached out to me. As I handed him my hand, he slowly wrote on the palm of my hand. The child said in a terrified voice.\u201cLet me go!\u201dThere are ears that are listening. From now on, write on the palm, so the lady can answer with her hands.\u201cCome on, can\u2019t you say the right thing?!\u201dOkay. I can\u2019t take too long, so I\u2019ll get to the point. Tell Her Majesty to use what I handed over.\u201cPlease forgive me, Lady Mis\u00e9rian!\u201dYes, I will say that.At the end, the child was pushed out of the door as if shoved by me and rolled on the floor. And he ran away as if he couldn\u2019t bear it because he was scared.I could breathe, I turned it around with this. When will the empress carry out the plan? It was not even estimated, but now I had no choice but to believe it.The marquis \u2018couldn\u2019t\u2019 or \u2018wouldn\u2019t\u2019 come to me? I even brought the empress in to catch the marquis, but it would have been very difficult if he noticed a hint and fled abroad.I thought the empress would be monitoring on her own even if I didn\u2019t give her any notice.I was terribly tired, physically, mentally, but somehow I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. But even if I wasn\u2019t sleepy, I had to force myself to sleep. This was because time went by too slowly if I didn\u2019t sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
