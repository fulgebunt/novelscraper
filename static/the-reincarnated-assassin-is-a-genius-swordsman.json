There was only the path that reeked of death.\u201cRaon.\u201dI raised my head upon hearing a voice, one that weighed heavily on my heart. A middle-aged man with what looked like white frost combed into long silvery hair stepped into view.It was\u00a0him.Derus Robert.Like a morass of death, the enormous garden billowed death into the air due to the presence of a single man\u2014the head of House Robert.\u201cYes.\u201dI swallowed hard and opened my mouth.\u201cYou have shown a competence that befits your title as the leader of the Shadows. The family has grown even faster thanks to you moving behind the scenes.\u201d\u201cI merely did my job.\u201dI did not pretend to be happy or otherwise. I bowed my head like an emotionless wooden doll.\u201cBut Raon\u2026\u201dHe began softly.\u201cDo you think that a Shadow needs freedom?\u201dDerus reached out his hand. His shadow extended its hand across the ground as well.\u201cIt is enough for a Shadow to follow its master\u2019s orders. Thoughts, emotions,\u00a0feelings\u00a0are unnecessary.\u201d\u201cThat is correct.\u201d\u201cWhy did you act on your own, even though you knew that?\u201dDerus\u2019 voice sharpened, becoming cold, and tightened around my heart.\u201cAnd you even broke your indoctrination.\u201dGoosebumps formed along my spine. I bit down on my tongue to hide my surprise.What?I had not spoken or acted differently than before, and I had not the slightest idea how he found out that the indoctrination had lost its effect.\u201cSpeak. When, and how, did you break the indoctrination?\u201dAt that point, it was clear that he already knew everything if he was acting like that.\u201cHow did you find out?\u201dI bit my lip and raised my head.Indoctrination.It was how House Robert controlled the assassination team called \u2018Shadow\u2019.They abducted or bought young children and, after killing off their emotions, indoctrinated them and used them as assassins for the rest of their lives.I too was indoctrinated, but was able to get rid of the dreadful shackles in a strange turn of fate.\u201cBecause you were preparing to escape the clan.\u201dDerus continued leisurely.\u201cI put two leashes on all of the assassins of Shadow, including you. The first one is indoctrination, and the second\u2026.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dA scream burst from me before I even registered the extreme pain. It was as if my lungs and heart were being sawed through.\u201cRage Worm. The insect placed in your body is gouging your heart out at my command.\u201d\u201cR-rage Worm\u2026.\u201dRage Worm was the worst black magic, the type that could even discern a slave\u2019s emotions.It seemed as if Derus had used the Rage Worm to become aware of my plan to escape House Robert.\u201cI-it\u2019s not enough to put on a facade of justice, you even went so far as to have fed me Rage Worm? You disgusting bastard!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not disgusting. It\u2019s called being thorough. And you did actually break the indoctrination.\u201dDerus smiled, the warm gaze that he showed in public on his face.\u201cThere is a saying that every human lives while wearing a mask. It\u2019s just that my mask is a little thicker and more special when compared to others.\u201d\u201cDerus Robert\u2026\u2026\u201dI clenched my teeth. I raised my body, stifling the heart-splitting pain.I could not die without doing\u00a0something.I was abducted at an age that I do not even remember properly, and was raised to become an underground hunting dog and assassin for House Robert.I had lived, forgetting all emotion and feeling, and only coincidently managed to break free from the indoctrination.I had thought that I could finally live according to my own will, but it was not the key to my prison but the shackles of death that met me.What sort of sin had I committed that forced me to live like a dog, I do not know.Damn it!A reddish water filled up the dried-off well of emotions. It was a rage that I had never felt before.\u201cYou can stand in that state?\u201dDerus\u2019 expression wavered a little.\u201cI will not meet my end in disgrace.\u201dI grasped the sword at my waist.My senses, which had detected my death, had not changed since I stepped into the garden.I will die here.If I was meant to die anyway, I would not go down without a fight. At the very least, his arm\u2026 No, I would at least create a wound and die.\u201cAaaargh!\u201dI unsheathed my sword, the concentrated aura exploding.At that moment\u2026The blade stretching out broke in half.Click.I heard the sound of the necklace around my neck falling to the ground.The world spun as Derus\u2019 cold eyes and the moon flipped upside down.Ah\u2026That\u2019s when I knew. My head had been cut off by Derus\u2019 sword.However, the assassin\u2019s sword is not all that meets the eye.The frightening aura hidden behind the broken blade flew towards Derus\u2019 face.\u201cHow vulgar.\u201dDerus waved his hand as if annoyed. The final attack went out like a flame at the light gesture, as if he were swatting away a fly.As expected\u2026Derus was a warrior said to be the strongest in the continent. It was expected that I would be unable to win.For he was strong, and I was weak. It could not be helped.Yes\u2026 It\u2026 can!The rage that had begun to spread from the bottom of my heart boiled up like lava.It was unfair that my entire life had been toyed with by Derus, and it was a painful shame that I could not complete the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 that I had obtained by fate.I could not die that way.God, or even the Devil was fine.As the rage\u2014the desire to tear Derus\u2019 mask off and slit his throat at any cost\u2014engulfed my whole body, my world ceased in red.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Lkjgh][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dDerus Robert brought his right hand up and frowned.\u2018I definitely blocked that.\u2019There was a small wound on the back of his hand, even though he had perfectly cut off the final sword attack from that piece of trash.It has been years since he last had an injury that drew blood.\u2018Ridiculous.\u2019That man had broken from the indoctrination on his own, endured the torture of the Rage Worm, and had even left an injury on Derus\u2019 body.It was disconcerting, wondering what happened to the hunting dog raised to be an expendable object.\u2018Only\u2026\u2019Raon was now dead. Though he went against common sense, there was no need to bother with him any longer.\u201cClean it.\u201dSoldiers hidden in the shadows of the garden rushed out and moved towards Raon\u2019s body the moment Derus turned his back.Blink.Raon\u2019s necklace, sunk deep in red blood, emitted a bluish light, but there was none who could see it.You have been chosen by <Wrath>.<Wrath> will descend upon your body\u2026 Your body has died!Error\u2026* * *Reincarnation.A fantastical notion that many believed to exist, but at the same time many did not believe in.Raon did not believe in rebirth either.He had been indoctrinated his whole life, and when he broke free from it he was busy with preparations to escape House Robert. As such, he did not even consider such absurd thoughts.He thought that death was the end.However\u2026\u201cSunshine, look here!\u201dA beautiful lady, with red eyes and soft golden locks that flowed down over her shoulder, shook the blue-coloured baby rattle.\u201cThere is also a red one!\u201dShe held out a red-coloured one in her left hand as well.Rattle!Though he wrinkled his face at the sound of the rattles hitting each other, the blonde lady did not stop her shaking.\u201cAboo.\u201dRaon gave a soft sigh and reached out for the baby rattle.\u201cYes! Come this way!\u201dThe blonde lady breamed broadly and shook the baby rattle more excitedly.There were two things in his field of view. A pair of arms, chubby like sausages, and a lady shaking the baby rattle.\u2018I still can\u2019t get used to this. These arms are my arms, and that lady is my mother\u2026\u2019The lady\u2019s name was Sylvia. Though it was still pretty unbelievable, he had reincarnated into that lady\u2019s child whilst retaining the memories of his past life as an assassin.He had naturally regarded it as a dream at first.He thought that everything would be over after he got some sleep, but he never seemed to awaken from this strange dream, no matter how much he slept.And so the days had dubiously passed to become one hundred days, and it was only then that Raon accepted the fact that he had, in fact, reincarnated.\u201cSunshine! Over here!\u201d\u201cA-woo!\u201dWhen he slowly crawled towards the baby rattle, Sylvia stepped back little by little.\u201cYes! A little more!\u201dRaon followed Sylvia as he crawled and reached his hand out towards the rattle.\u201cAboo\u2026\u201dBut his body could not endure the weight of his heavy head and started leaning towards the right.\u201cOh!\u201dSylvia flung the baby rattle away and threw her body towards Raon, embracing him in her arms.\u2018She\u2019s quick.\u2019Her body was very fast. Though he could not detect aura, it seemed that she had acquainted herself with some appropriate martial arts.\u201cWere you surprised? It\u2019s alright. It\u2019s fine.\u201dSylvia patted Raon\u2019s back.\u201cOoh.\u201dRaon shook his hand. Her patting did not stop although he showed that he was not at all surprised and all right.\u201cMy Sunshine, shall we go see the flowers?\u201dSylvia walked over to the window and opened the curtains whilst carrying him. The warm sunlight shone gently, like a soft cotton blanket.\u2018How can she still call me Sunshine\u2026?\u2019\u2018Sunshine\u2019, as Sylvia called him, was not his actual name. It was a baby bump name.It was the head of house who had to come and choose his name, but he appeared to be terribly busy and Raon had yet to see a sign of him.Thus, there was no choice but to be called by the baby bump name \u2018Sunshine\u2019, even after more than a hundred days had passed.\u2018Whew\u2026\u2019Raon looked about, still in Sylvia\u2019s arms.The room was wide enough to be able to run around in, the walls had a luxurious sea-coloured wallpaper, and there was magic lighting hanging from the ceiling that lit up, even at night.He could not determine much, for his body was a baby\u2019s and slept more than twenty hours a day, but one thing was certain.This was a wealthy family, and one with quite the reputation at that.\u2018Not bad.\u2019A rich or powerful family was preferable over a normal one in any case, now that he had been reborn.\u2018I need to take revenge.\u2019The horrifying feeling of having his neck chopped off by Derus was still vivid in his mind.He had thought that all his feelings had been worn away while being raised as an assassin. His memory before death must have been intense, for his rage and thirst for revenge clearly remained.\u2018But I should not be impatient.\u2019Raon breathed deeply and calmed his emotions.He knew nothing about where he was, or what his position was, as he lived exclusively within this room.It would not be too late to make preparations for revenge after getting a grasp of the situation.The most important virtue for an assassin was patience, and he had once been the best of the assassins.He could rein in his feelings and thirst for revenge any time.\u2018Also\u2026\u2019He had obtained the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 in his past life through some fate, which was said to be the most powerful skill that could be attained by a swordsman one thousand years ago.If he were to master the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, it might be possible for him to kill Derus Robert not by assassination, but even by facing him head-on.He would have to endure and endure again for that day to come.\u2018Anyway, I am starting to feel a little sleepy again\u2026\u2019He felt drowsy in Sylvia\u2019s arms, under the warm sunlight.A baby\u2019s body was inconvenient in many ways. He really had not spent a long time thinking, yet he was already falling asleep.\u201cYou sleepy, Sunshine? Let\u2019s go to bed, then.\u201dSylvia slowed her patting on his back with a smile. It was just as he was dozing off and his neck was falling backwards that\u2026\u201cLady Sylvia!\u201dThe door opened without a knock, and Sylvia\u2019s maid entered the room.\u201cThe-the head of house is on his way!\u201d\u201cMy father?\u201dSylvia widened her eyes in shock at the maid\u2019s words.\u2018Father?\u2019It appeared that the head of house was not his father, but his grandfather, since she called him father.\u201cI-I shall have to get ready\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is too late! He is already outside!\u201d\u201cOh dear!\u201dSylvia and the maids became very flustered, tapping their feet repeatedly.Clomp.There was the sound of footsteps outside the half-open door, which sounded stiff enough to make one\u2019s body shrink.\u2018Who is the head of house?\u2019Raon stealthily opened his eyes and turned his head towards the door.An old man with red eyes and radiant blonde hair smoothed over his forehead approached. Sylvia and the maid trembled at the sound of his overbearing footsteps.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019The passage of time slowed down the moment he saw the old man\u2019s eyes. It almost felt as if his surroundings were blurred by his overbearing presence.\u201cF-father.\u201d\u201cIs this the child?\u201dThe old man stopped in front of Sylvia and pointed with his chin, frost in his gaze.\u201cOh, yes.\u201dSylvia nodded her head heavily and held Raon out to him.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Raon\u2019s round eyes grew wider. As he looked right into his face, he felt as if he had seen him before.\u2018Blonde with red eyes. An old man with cold features, as if surrounding himself with a sheet of ice\u2026 Oh!\u2019A thunderbolt struck his small head.Glenn Zieghart, the Destructive King of the North!The family was referred to as the apex of the continent, and its leader was looking down at him.A small gasp of surprise escaped his small mouth on its own.It seemed that he was reborn into the most powerful family in the continent.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who lurked within the underground, who spread defeat and fear, were called the Five Demons.House Zeighart was one of the Six Kings, and ruled over the North.\u201cAh-ooh.\u201dRaon made eye contact with the head of House Zieghart and widened his round mouth.\u2018Is this a good thing\u2026?\u2019Zieghart didn\u2019t lose out in any way to House Robert, the place that had exploited and killed him in his past life.His day of revenge could be brought forward if he built up his strength in that environment.\u201cHe is blonde and has red eyes, just like you and me, Father.\u201dSylvia smiled gently and stroked Raon\u2019s hair while he agonized over how to act from then on.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn maintained his overwhelming pressure over the others, even as he held Raon up.\u2018Huh?\u2019Raon\u2019s body shuddered. It was because a warm and gentle energy entered through his wrist the moment Glenn picked him up.\u201cOoh\u2026\u201dAt the feel of aura, which he had not felt in a long time, he let out a noise before he even realized it.\u2018What sort of aura\u2026\u2019Glenn\u2019s aura was not only warm. It also contained an enormously high level of purity, like it came straight from nature.\u2018It\u2019s warming up my body.\u2019Raon was much more sensitive to the cold after his reincarnation. At first, he assumed it was because his body was that of a young child. Instead, there was actually a major problem with his constitution.But the moment he received Glenn\u2019s aura, his whole body became warmer\u2014as if sunlight had entered his bloodstream.Glenn used his aura to check through Raon\u2019s body inch by inch, returning him to Sylvia afterwards.\u2018What?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. There was no way that a warrior like Glenn did not know there was an issue with his body, yet there was no change in his expression.He could not understand why he maintained that expression, even after finding out his grandson was not normal.\u201cSylvia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe child\u2019s name shall be Raon.\u201d\u201cRaon? F-Father. The name Raon means\u2026\u201dSylvia\u2019s eyebrows furrowed heavily.\u201cIt literally means that. Quiet like a shadow. It means to live without standing out.\u201dUnlike his gentle use of aura, Glenn\u2019s voice was cold as frost.\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019Was it fate or something?His name was the same as in his past life, and the meaning was also the same. A laugh forced its way out at the absurdity of the situation.He knew that Glenn was a cold-hearted person, but he did not know that Glenn would have no interest in his sick grandson.\u201cThat is all.\u201dGlenn brushed off his dark red coat and turned his body away, as if not wanting to be there any longer.\u201cWait! Father! Another name, at least\u2026\u201dSylvia followed him while carrying Raon, but Glenn did not turn back. He promptly left the mansion.It seemed more accurate to say that they were strangers, not father and daughter.\u201cOoh-woo!\u201dRaon\u2019s lips trembled. He wanted to stay quiet, but a moan escaped his lips at the chilly wind blowing in from outside.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201dSylvia hugged Raon close and buried her face in his body. It appeared she was barely holding back tears.\u2018There is something here. But I\u2019m too sleepy. I can\u2019t think.\u2019Raon slowly closed his eyes, feeling both the cold wind and Sylvia\u2019s warmth skim over his entire body.\u2018A child\u2019s body really is very inconvenient\u2026\u2019* * *The moon was floating in the middle of the sky.Raon, who was lying down on the crib, cautiously opened his eyes.\u2018She\u2019s asleep.\u2019He turned his head to the side. Sylvia was sleeping on the bed right beside him.Knock.It appeared she was sound asleep, since she did not wake up even when he tapped on the crib.\u2018Whew\u2026\u2019He let out a small sigh.The past hundred days had been extremely suffocating.He became terribly drowsy all the time, and he could not use mana nor train because he was with Sylvia whenever he was awake.He couldn\u2019t do anything, as there could be a problem if he were to be even gently nudged during his practice. But his chance had finally arrived.\u2018Crib.\u2019He got to sleep separately in the warm crib from that day onward, once Helen\u2014the head maid of the bedchambers\u2014offered her advice.Though she was right beside him, there was no way Sylvia would wake up. It was the perfect time to begin his practice.\u2018Let\u2019s get started\u2026\u2019Raon slowly exhaled.\u2018With the cultivation of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2019The method of the practice, implemented in the continent, was about accumulating aura in the abdomen by taking in mana from nature via breathing.But the practice for the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, which he had obtained by fate in his past life, was different.By rotating the spherical ring around one\u2019s heart, as if one were a sorcerer making a magic circle, one\u2019s physical strength and body would improve. At the same time, it also increased one\u2019s willpower and sensitivity to mana.Which meant that, though it could not create aura, the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was a cultivation technique that could help improve the mind and body\u2014the perfect conditions for becoming a soldier.\u2018That is not the only advantage.\u2019The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was a practice that followed the flow of nature exactly. Even a soldier at the highest level would not be able to determine that he had practiced the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.Even Derus Robert, referred to as the greatest swordsman in the continent, did not know that Raon had acquired the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.However, there was a very big issue with Raon\u2019s body.\u2018Coldness.\u2019The mana circuit, where mana flowed through like blood in his veins, was blocked by the extreme coldness in his body.It was not long ago that he first discovered that fact.He had tried to use his mana for a brief moment, whilst acting as if he were asleep, but almost shrieked upon feeling the coldness blocking his mana circuit.Raon slowly took in a breath of air until his lungs ached, and felt the mana spread out in the air.\u2018It\u2019s being dispersed.\u2019Perhaps it was because his basic mana affinity was poor, but he could not feel mana that well, unlike his past self.He only barely managed to take in the mana, and settled it in his mana circuit after quite some time.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019Raon suddenly stopped before he was to start practicing the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 with the absorbed mana.\u2018I feel it, as expected.\u2019The mana circuit at his shoulder was half blocked by the coldness.\u2018No wonder I am constantly drowsy, and so cold.\u2019The reason he has been sleeping more than twenty hours, and feeling the severe chilliness, was due to this coldness.\u2018Is it in nine places?\u2019He released some mana to scan through his entire body. There were nine places in the mana circuit that were blocked by the cold.\u2018This is severe\u2026\u2019Unlike that of an adult, a baby\u2019s mana circuit was wide open. Since the coldness filled it halfway, even while in that state, the entire mana circuit could become blocked as he grew older.Should that moment come, he would experience cold and pain that would be incomparable to what he experienced currently\u2014or worse, die.He had to remove the coldness, no matter what, before that happened.\u2018I should try to pierce through the coldness in my mana circuit, using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2019Though his practice with the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 would be considerably delayed, the priority for the moment was to survive.Raon slowly absorbed the mana as he took a deep breath. The absorbed mana cut into thin, sharp, awl-like pieces and pierced the coldness blocking his mana circuit.Screech!As if it was a frozen waterfall chipped away at by a fork, a tiny bit of the coldness dropped off.\u2018Wait. Can\u2019t I make use of this?\u2019He could release the coldness as it was, but it seemed a waste\u2014especially considering the high purity of it.Raon guided the coldness with the natural mana, following the flow of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.The natural mana and the coldness that was blocking the mana circuit bonded together as one to circulate through the mana circuit throughout his body.\u2018I did it!\u2019Raon clenched his fist. It was at a much slower speed when compared to in his past life, but he could use mana via the flow of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 without issue.He felt the cold air drawn forth by the mana settling in his body.\u2018It must be because it\u2019s a child\u2019s body.\u2019It was somewhat fortunate, as he would not have been able to circulate mana at all because of the coldness if it wasn\u2019t a child\u2019s wide-open mana circuit.\u2018Next I should\u2026 Huh? Already?\u2019As if his body was saying it was tired after using its brain and strength a little, he started to feel sleepy. His eyelids lowered like curtains, completely against his will.\u2018Damn it\u2026\u2019Raon groaned angrily and closed his eyes.As he fell asleep, and the moon hung in the sky moved to just about three fingers-width apart, a figure appeared outside the door.The person who entered without opening the door was the head of House Zieghart, Glenn.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn gazed at Raon, who was asleep, and reached out his hand. A light as pale as the sunset bloomed out of his clenched hand.Raon\u2019s forehead, which was crumpled due to the coldness in his mana circuit, smoothed out like velvet.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Lkjgh][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cA-bu-bu.\u201dRaon gave a soft sigh.\u2018As expected, it isn\u2019t easy.\u2019There was no time to work on the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 since his waking hours were short. Even then, he was mostly around other people.But considering the progress was delayed by the short, one- to two-hour practice time and the coldness, the outcome was surprisingly decent. It was as if someone was helping him.\u201cRaon, shall we move a bit more today?\u201dSylvia bent over and shook the baby rattle. It appeared as though she thought he liked the rattle, as he continuously reacted to it.\u2018Playing with her is tiring.\u2019Frankly speaking, it was more tiring having to play with Sylvia or the maids than it was tolerating the coldness.Though, it couldn\u2019t be helped. After all, his was an adult\u2019s consciousness inside a child\u2019s body.\u201cAah-ooh.\u201dIt was just as Raon bobbed his head and was about to crawl towards Sylvia\u2026Click.The door opened smoothly and an unfamiliar old man with silver hair entered the room. He was wearing frayed and shabby clothes, but his eyes were as clear as the river.\u201cOh? Uncle!\u201dSylvia ran to the door with a bright smile on her face, as if she recognised the old man.\u201cIt has been a long time.\u201d\u201cNo, no. Saint\u2026\u201d\u201cAah-woong.\u201dRaon babbled in surprise before he realized it. He recognized the old man from the title of Saint, and because of his beggar-like clothes.\u2018The Ragged Saint!\u2019The Ragged Saint Patrick was one of the most famous healers in the continent.Though his holy powers and medical experience extended beyond the sky, he was a vagabond and difficult to find\u2014even when one searched for him.\u201cNot Saint. Just call me \u2018Uncle\u2019, like before.\u201dPatrick chuckled and approached the bed Raon was lying on.\u201cI heard that you had a child, and popped over on my way by. Is this the child?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cOho! Blonde with red eyes? Is he not the first since you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201dSylvia stroked Raon\u2019s hair and beamed.\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. He is not even a year old and looks pretty. Completely different from a wild guy like Glenn.\u201dPatrick chuckled and wagged his finger in front of Raon.\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Raon\u2026\u201d\u201cRaon?\u201dHis face wrinkled up at the name.\u201cHis name can\u2019t mean \u2018shadow\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt does\u2026\u201d\u201cWhatever is Glenn thinking, naming the child \u2018shadow\u2019?\u201dPatrick referred to House Zieghart\u2019s head as just \u2018Glenn\u2019.\u2018So the rumor that Glenn Zieghart and the Ragged Saint are friends is true, then.\u2019Raon smacked his lips as he looked at the broom that was Patrick\u2019s hair.Having lived as an assassin, he did have quite a bit of information regarding the affairs of the world.It seemed that the information regarding the considerable closeness of Glenn Zieghart and the Ragged Saint was true.\u201cRaon, allow this old man to look at you for a bit.\u201dPatrick gently massaged Raon\u2019s shoulders and arms, legs and chest area.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe chewed on his lips with a grave expression on his face, and finally spread out a white light. Upon basking in that light, a burning energy filled up his body\u2014if he had entered a hot spring.\u201cPhew.\u201dPatrick turned his body after a low sigh.\u201cHow is he? He is more sensitive to the cold, and grows slowly compared to the other children\u2026\u201dSylvia walked towards Patrick, her hands clasped together.\u201cIt is the Curse of the Frost.\u201dPatrick knit his brows.\u201cC-curse? What do you mean by that?!\u201d\u201cIt is not an actual curse. It is the constitution where an intense coldness blocks the mana circuit.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is a constitution rarely seen, typically among young girls. It is my first time seeing a young boy born with the Curse of the Frost.\u201dHe surveyed Raon\u2019s body with an odd look in his eyes.\u201cThere should be no major problems as his mana circuit is open, but he may experience serious chill and pain when the mana circuit starts to close up\u2014that is, once he reaches four years of age.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2026\u201dSylvia chewed her lips uneasily.\u2018I can fix it on my own, so don\u2019t worry.\u2019Raon shook his head slightly.Though it would take some time, he would be able to remove the coldness by using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019. There was no actual need to get treated.\u201cThere are a total of nine chunks of coldness blocking the mana circuit. That is a number that even I have not seen in the young girls that I have treated before. And as each of the chunks of coldness are very potent, there is a possibility of mental slowness should a forceful attempt to drill through it be made.\u201d\u201cWh-what about the method to cure it?!\u201dSylvia grabbed onto Patrick\u2019s sleeve, looking as if she might faint at any minute.\u201cLet him drink diluted elixir, containing the properties of fire, once a day. Let him bask under the sunlight for two hours at noon, when the sun is at its highest.\u201d\u201cWill he recover if we do that?\u201d\u201cAs I have said, this is not an illness. It is a matter of constitution. He shall not return to heaven\u2019s bosom at a young age, at the very least, if you follow my directions. However\u2026\u201dWhen Patrick cut his words short, everyone swallowed hard as he took his time answering.\u201cBecause the coldness will eat at the child\u2019s constitution and strength, it will be difficult for him to become a swordsman, even after treatment.\u201d\u201cThat does not matter.\u201dSylvia fiercely shook her head, as if to say that it was all fine, as long as he did not die.\u201cIt is a relief that you think that way. Anyway, this child should\u2026\u201dKnock, knock.Just as Patrick was about to give additional advice, the door opened with a knock.\u201cPlease excuse me.\u201dA middle-aged man wearing posh formal attire entered the room and bowed his head.\u201cMy lord is looking for the Saint.\u201d\u201cLet him know that I will find him later.\u201d\u201cHe has said to come find him immediately.\u201d\u201cHah. He has such bad timing.\u201dPatrick clicked his tongue, and turned his head.\u201cSylvia. I shall come by again later.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dPatrick left the room with the middle-aged man after gazing at Raon for a moment longer.\u2018The Curse of Frost\u2026\u2019Raon rubbed his fingers.\u2018I finally know.\u2019The identity of the coldness that had tormented him had been revealed. Only, nothing would really change.He would cure the Curse of Frost and develop an incomparably outstanding physical body and affinity for mana before he became an adult, and he would do it by continuing to practice the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and removing the coldness at the same time.\u201cRaon.\u201dThe moment the door shut, Sylvia hugged Raon and scrubbed at her face. It was how she acted when anxious.\u201cMommy promises to save you. Whatever it takes.\u201dHer eyes, which were always smiling, filled up with tears.\u2018What\u2019s this\u2026?\u2019As Sylvia\u2019s trembling was conveyed to him, his heart felt suffocated. It felt as if a rough wire was scratching his heart.Though he did not know what the emotion was, he did not want to continue feeling that tingling sensation.Which was why\u2014\u201cA-bu-bu.\u201dWith his small hands, Raon wiped away the tears welled up in Sylvia\u2019s eyes.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cMy-my goodness\u2026\u201dSylvia narrowed her eyes, and the maids gave a short shriek.\u201cRaon\u2026\u201dShe lowered her head and caressed Raon\u2019s hand, wet with her tears, for some time.\u00a0 Suddenly, she jumped to her feet.\u201cI must go find my father.\u201dThe hesitation on Sylvia\u2019s face was gone.* * *For the first time since Raon was born, Sylvia made her way to the place where the head of House Zieghart resided.The way there was wide open, as the Saint had passed by earlier.\u201cM-Madam Sylvia!\u201d\u201cThe head of house is currently with\u2026\u201d\u201cMove aside!\u201dShe forcefully pushed past the attendants and maids blocking her way and knocked on the door of the audience chamber.Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!The enormous door started to open after five punch-like knocks.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dGlenn, who was sitting opposite Patrick and having tea, frowned.\u201cI beg you.\u201dSylvia clenched her teeth hard and knelt.\u201cPlease save Raon!\u201dThough there were attendants behind her, she lowered her head to the ground as if she were a slave submitting to her master.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn watched Sylvia bow her head without batting an eye.\u201cYou must have heard, yes? That it will be difficult for him to live as a soldier, even if his constitution were to be treated.\u201dGlenn knew of Raon\u2019s condition, as if he had already heard of it.\u201cIt will be fine if we do not raise him as a soldier!\u201d\u201cFor one with the name of Zieghart to not become a soldier? Why should I give help to a child without any value?\u201d\u201cBecause he is your grandson.\u201d\u201cThat grandson is the child you brought back after leaving the family, after saying that you were going to cut all ties with us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dSylvia\u2019s trembling eyes were fixed to the floor.\u201cThe only thing I can do for the child is give him the name of Zieghart. Once is enough for any act of foolishness.\u201dGlenn\u2019s face was cold, as if covered by a sheet of ice.\u201cZieghart is a place where only the strongest survive. It is better to not have such a weak grandson. And won\u2019t you be able to obtain the elixir yourself?\u201d\u201cThe elixir in the family repository would be much more effective than obtaining it from outside\u2026\u201d\u201cThose are for the ones that improve the family name. There is nothing for a child who does nothing, even if he is my grandson. Get out, now.\u201d\u201cFather! Please!\u201dSylvia dug her fingers into her palm as if to draw blood, and hit her head against the floor again.\u2018I cannot back down!\u2019If she were alone, she would have returned. She would have left without turning back before, due to her pride.But she now had a child she had to protect. She had to hang on until the end, for Raon.\u201cDrag her out.\u201dSoldiers in black stepped out from behind the pillar at Glenn\u2019s stern orders. They grabbed onto both of Sylvia\u2019s arms and dragged her to the door.\u201cP-please! Raon!\u201dSylvia screamed Raon\u2019s name until the end, but Glenn turned his head away as if he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dPatrick, who was observing everything, let out a sigh.\u201cYour acting is good, considering you were the one who called for me to check on your grandson\u2019s condition. Is it that hard to treat her honestly?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being unnecessarily noisy. Just speak of his state, in detail.\u201d\u201cAs I have said, the coldness is blocking the mana circuit in nine places. Although it is fine now, it will become more dangerous as he grows older.\u201dPatrick sipped his tea and continued.\u201cBut I do not think there will be a major issue, thanks to you pushing away the coldness with your aura.\u201dGlenn and Patrick did not know that Raon was practicing the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, even though they had personally checked his body.The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was a method from a thousand years ago, and did not make use of the lower abdomen. It was difficult to identify the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, even if one could be said to have absolute abilities.\u201cYoung girls with the symptoms of the Curse of Frost make use of coldness of the highest purity and can become excellent sorcerers or swordsmen, but it is different for young boys with warmer energies. As I said, it is close to impossible for your youngest grandson to become a soldier.\u201d\u201cIt does not matter if he does not become a soldier. As long as he lives.\u201d\u201cYou browbeat Sylvia, and now you say it does not matter? Even the Destructive King of the North must love his grandson.\u201dPatrick chuckled heartily.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn ignored Patrick and drew his finger in the air.Buzz\u2026As the space cracked open in a cross(\u5341)\u00a0shape, a golden dimension opened up. Three wooden boxes popped out of the fiery space.\u201cI assume you know how to do it?\u201dHe spoke as he passed the boxes over to Patrick.\u201cAh\u2026 This is why I do not bother with things like Houses.\u201dPatrick sighed and accepted the wooden boxes.\u201cTake care of him.\u201dGlenn\u2019s sharp voice rang low, to a strange extent.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, but why did you name the child Raon? There are much better names out there, and out of everything it is \u2018shadow\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2018Shadow\u2019 is not the only meaning of the name \u2018Raon\u2019.\u201dHe shook his head and watched the golden sun, floating high up in the sky.\u201cA thousand years ago, it meant something entirely opposite.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You disliked bitter medicine when you were young, as well.\u201d\u201cI did?\u201d\u201cYou may not remember. There was a time that you even ran away, saying that you did not wish to take it.\u201d\u201cHey, Raon\u2019s listening.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dThey both giggled as they glanced down at Raon, who was snoring quietly.\u201cIndeed, no child likes medicine. Raon is so young, too. He will hate it even more.\u201d\u201cBut milady\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. He must take it.\u201dSylvia nodded her head in determination.\u2018This is an elixir from Uncle. I cannot let a single drop go to waste.\u2019As if her pleading with Father had troubled him, Patrick had come by the annex again and given her three good-quality elixirs with fire properties.Since she was diluting the Elixirs as she used them, they would be able to last for quite some time. In the meantime, she could look for other elixirs elsewhere. It was fortunate that he had come.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia gently smoothed down Raon\u2019s hair, not wanting to upset him.\u201cNghh\u2026\u201dRaon flexed his fingers as he opened his eyes.\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d\u201cAh-ooh-nghh.\u201d\u201cThere is something you must do from today onwards, Raon. You must drink all of this.\u201dSylvia scooped the medicine up with a small wooden spoon and brought it to Raon\u2019s lips.\u2018He will drink it, but will probably cry right after.\u2019Though it was a child\u2019s instinct to consume the medicine, it was certain that he would throw a fit and spit it out immediately.\u201cNow, let\u2019s drink.\u201dSylvia poured the elixir into Raon\u2019s mouth, tensing as she made sure that the elixir did not trickle out.\u201cOoh-aah\u2026\u201dShe watched Raon scrunch up his face. She grimaced as she waited for his tears to start.But there were no tears.\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen she cautiously opened her eyes, Raon was waving his small hands in the air. It was as if he was telling her to give him more.\u201cHelen. This\u2026\u201d\u201cY-young master seems to be asking for more?\u201d\u201cRight? Is that correct?\u201dSylvia widened her eyes and picked the spoon up again. This time, she scooped a larger amount than before and poured it into Raon\u2019s mouth.\u201cOoh-ooh!\u201dRaon\u2019s eyebrows shot up to form a mountain\u2026 But he still did not cry. He jerked his hands faster.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dSylvia\u2019s lips parted.\u201cDo you think Raon understood my intentions?\u201d\u201cDefinitely! It seems that the young master recognizes your intentions and is enduring it.\u201dIt was obvious from his scrunched-up expression that he found it bitter. But as he was asking for more, it was clear that he understood and was going to endure the ordeal.\u201cRaon!\u201dSylvia couldn\u2019t help but hug Raon tightly.* * *\u2018Just give me more of the medicine. Faster.\u2019Raon waved his hand as he tapped on Sylvia\u2019s shoulder.\u2018Even if it is a little bitter, this is nothing. I cannot miss this opportunity.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just any normal medicine. What he needed the most was an elixir with fire properties. Though it was bitter and hot, to the point that his tongue felt numb, he had to finish it all.\u201cLook at Raon! Don\u2019t you think he eats like such a sweetheart?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dRaon did not let what Sylvia and Helen were saying bother him, swallowing the elixir the moment it passed his lips.\u2018Though I don\u2019t know what it is, the effects are insane.\u2019The moment he drank the elixir, a fiery energy started burning in his stomach\u2014as if starting a blast furnace. The heat flowed through the mana circuit and started to drive out the coldness.\u2018The effect and concentration of the medicine is just right.\u2019A strong elixir could actually be poison for a child\u2019s weak body.It seemed that Sylvia and Helen had ensured that the concentration of the elixir was suitable for absorption.Blerp.Raon gave a small burp after licking off the remaining elixir on the spoon. He closed his eyes.\u201cMilady.\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s leave him to sleep.\u201dSylvia and Helen watched him, evidently moved as their eyes shone, before leaving.\u201cWhew.\u201dRaon opened his eyes immediately after they had left.\u2018I don\u2019t think they will return for some time.\u2019And even if they did, they would not bother him.Since he already had both food and medicine, there was no way either Sylvia or Helen would wake him. Therefore, it was the best moment to practice.Raon brought the warm energy filling up his body forward and began his practice with the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018It will be faster to create the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and melt the coldness, thanks to the elixir.\u2019A grin appeared on his lips without him realizing it.***Time flew by. It had already been two and a half years since Raon began to practice his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.His daily routine had become very simple.He woke up in the morning and played with Sylvia and Helen. After lunch and the elixir, he pretended to fall asleep and trained the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 during this nap time.After dinner, he would go to sleep early and wake up at around midnight. That was when he would begin his second round of practice, as everyone else was asleep.Above all else, he was confident that when compared to all the other three-year-olds in the continent, he was the one who had lived life to the fullest.\u2018If all goes well, I think I can attain one-star for the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 today.\u2019There was steady progress, even if his training time was short, thanks to the elixir.It seemed like he could practice the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 later, as long as he secured the right timing and focus.\u2018By the way, it seems he really doesn\u2019t care at all.\u2019Glenn Zieghart had not shown his face since he had given Raon his name. It seemed that he had no interest in not just Raon, but his daughter Sylvia as well.\u2018Well, doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019There was no need for him to bother if the other party did not make an effort. As he had planned before, he would leave the clan after taking what he needed, and that was that.\u2018But it is a little\u2026\u2019It was just that Sylvia, Helen, and the other maids remaining behind weighed heavily on his mind. It seemed that, after being with them for three years, tiny feelings had begun to sprout in his heart.\u201cRaon. Call me \u2018Mommy\u2019!\u201dWhile Raon was fidgeting with his fingers and thinking of the future, Sylvia giggled and held him up.\u201cMaam!\u201d\u201cAh! One more time!\u201d\u201cMama!\u201d\u201cAaah!\u201dWhen he forced himself to mumble and call her \u2018Mama\u2019, Sylvia\u2019s face brightened up. Her eyes melted in happiness.\u201cRaon. Just once more!\u201d\u201cMama!\u201d\u201cMilady, I\u2019ve brought the medicine.\u201dAs he played with Sylvia with a slightly tired look on his face, Helen brought over the heated elixir.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dSylvia accepted the bowl of elixir from Helen.\u201cHere, Raon.\u201dShe cooled the hot elixir a little and scooped it for him.\u201cAh-mmf!\u201dRaon\u2019s small mouth came forward to meet the spoon.\u201cLook at you!\u201dSylvia and Helen smiled as they watched Raon swallow the elixir, even two and a half years later.\u201cSleepy\u2026\u201dAfter finishing the elixir, Raon blinked his eyes heavily, as if he were sleepy.\u201cSince we finished the medicine, shall we go for a nap?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cAlright. Go to sleep.\u201dSylvia put Raon down on the bed facing the window and patted his stomach.\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201dRaon closed his eyes and acted as if he was falling asleep. He heard Sylvia and Helen leaving the room not long after. They took a break while he pretended to be asleep.\u2018I guess I can begin now.\u2019Raon recited the passage for the practice of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 as he closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.He let the mana, which was sucked in from nature with his inhale, flow through his entire body.\u2018The flow of mana is smooth.\u2019The mana flowed more smoothly, though his breathing was the same as usual. He felt as if was going to achieve something.\u2018Calm down.\u2019He calmly exhaled and connected the line of mana flowing in the mana circuit. The tips of his fingers trembled, as his lungs were small and he quickly went out of breath, but he endured.Using the hot energy from the elixir and mana from nature, he cut down the coldness inside the mana circuit. He then circulated it within his whole body.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Lkjgh][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Crackle.He felt the energy from the elixir and mana permeate his bones, muscles, and skin.He maintained his sharp focus, which was being sharpened like the edge of a knife, and continued with his cultivation of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.After some time had passed\u2026Flash!A burning sensation, as if a fireball cutting across his heart, resounded in his chest.A warm energy whirled around in his heart like a hoop. He had finally finished the Ring of Fire.\u2018It\u2019s finally\u2026\u201dJust as he was about to open his eyes and cheer, there was a flash of gold light.Ding!The first <Ring of Fire> has been obtained.The first achievement has been obtained.Special Trait <Ring of Fire (One-Star) has been created.\u2018Wh-what\u2019s this?\u2019Just like when a magic circle would appear before sorcerers when they used magic, a light floated in front of his eyes.Your body has become a little stronger with the effect of <Ring of Fire (One-Star)>.Strength, Agility, and Stamina have increased with the effect of the <Ring of Fire (One-Star)>.Special Trait <Water Resistance (One-Star)> has been created.Other information popped up after the message stating that he had acquired the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018Huh?\u2019Raon pursed his lips.\u2018What is this information\u2026?\u2019He felt his body become lighter the instant the messages appeared.Though there was not a massive difference, as it was a child\u2019s body, it was clear that there were changes.\u2018The pain has also subsided a little.\u2019The pain from the coldness blocking his mana circuit had decreased, as well.\u2018Did the Ring of Fire have this capability?\u2019While the Ring of Fire was correctly referred to as a legendary method of practice, the effectiveness was not remarkable until three rings had formed, and only after four rings did it take effect.He had not experienced feeling a difference from merely achieving One-Star in his past life.\u2018Is it because of the elixir, or because it is a child\u2019s body?\u2019He tried to consider it from different angles but had no answer.\u2018Or is it because of this message\u2026?\u2019Raon read the message floating in front of him again.Though there were some differences between the present and his previous life, the biggest one seemed to be this message.\u201cYoung master! You\u2019re already awake.\u201dHe heard Helen\u2019s voice from above his head. She seemed to have entered the room again while he was practicing.\u201cHewen! Wook at tis!\u201dRaon pointed at the message, which resembled a magic circle.\u201cYes? The Bed?\u201dAs Helen did not seem to see it, the message appeared to be only visible to him.Please check the <Status Window> to confirm the changes.\u2018Status Window? Huh?\u2019He repeated it mentally without knowing what it was, and a window with the same light as the message appeared.<Status Window>Name: Raon ZieghartTitle: NoneState: Curse of Frost (Nine Strands), Poor Stamina, Cold Body, Decline in Athletic Ability, Decline in Mana Affinity.*Additional Abilities have not been unlocked.He slowly examined the \u2018status window\u2019 in front of him.\u2018Curse of Frost, Poor Stamina, Cold Body, Decline in Athletic Ability, and Decline in Mana Affinity\u2026\u2019The information seemed to point towards his current state.\u2018As expected, my body is poor in many ways.\u2019Apart from the Curse of Frost, he even had a cold body and poor stamina. That was the reason he tired quickly after moving even a little.\u2018But it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019Raon closed his mouth. He was not at all worried, even if his constitution was bad.He was named the best assassin in his previous life, and he knew the best practice\u2014the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.If he completed the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 based on his experiences from his past life, it would be the same as not having those flaws.\u2018Furthermore, this is Zieghart.\u2019It was completely feasible to behead Derus Robert if he could master the swordsmanship techniques secretly documented within the Zieghart clan.\u2018And I am only three years old.\u2019Derus was one of the strongest on the continent. He would not be able to hold out if he got worked up over his revenge already.There is barely anyone who can kill him, anyway. Roan had to grow his strength and finish it off at one go the moment he had the chance, slowly but steadily.Raon balled his fists, as if making a pledge to himself, and looked at the status window again.\u2018So, really\u2026 What is this message?\u2019He had no idea why he was suddenly seeing the message and the status window. He could only tell from his instincts as an assassin that it was not going to hurt him.\u2018It probably has something to do with my reincarnation.\u2019He vaguely assumed that there was a connection between the message and the reason he was reborn with memories from his past life.It seemed he had to figure it out slowly, just as he had to do on his quest for Derus Robert\u2019s head.\u2018Let\u2019s not be impatient and take it slow.\u2019***The second <Ring of Fire> has been obtained.Your soul has become a little stronger with the effect of the <Ring of Fire (Two-Star)>.Mana Affinity, Willpower, and Energy have increased with the effect of the <Ring of Fire (Two-Star)>.Raon grinned widely after checking the message window.\u2018I finally did it.\u2019The second ring had formed upon consistent cultivation for the last two and a half years, starting after the first one had been obtained.The first \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was spinning around his heart horizontally, while the second \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, which had just formed, was spinning vertically.Perhaps it was due to the message that his affinity had increased, but he did feel more sensitive towards the mana drifting in the room.It was clear that the message was giving him a special benefit.\u2018To think that I managed to create two rings of fire by the age of five.\u2019It would be a first in the history of the continent for a child of the young age of five to have picked up the legendary practice of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019. His heart swelled with pride.\u2018I don\u2019t want to cause them any harm.\u2019Sylvia, Helen, and the other maids had only showered him with kindness.Though he was going to leave and could not provide help, he did not want to abuse their kindness.\u201cPhew.\u201dThe door burst open just as Raon was about to begin his practice again.\u201cMy son!\u201dSylvia entered. While she was smiling, her face looked pale.\u201cMother?\u201dHe had to call her mother properly now that he had passed five years of age. Though, he could not help the natural lisps in his pronunciation.\u201cDo you remember that I said there was somewhere you had to go with Mommy?\u201dShe spoke as she placed the dark red attire that she had brought with her on the bed and pulled off his sleepwear.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019She had said a few days prior that they were going to assemble the children from both lineal and collateral lines to check something.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will end quickly.\u201dSylvia smiled brightly, as if comforting him.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cHow is my darling son so kind and good looking?!\u201dSylvia paused in the middle of helping him change and rubbed her cheek against his face.\u2018Err, please\u2026\u2019Raon\u2019s hands shook, unable to do anything.It was Helen who stopped Sylvia, who had brought Raon into a long embrace even after having finished helping him change.\u201cMilady, now is not the time. The \u2018Judgment Ceremony\u2019 will begin soon!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its height almost seemed to reach the sky, and the width left his field of vision even from such a distance.It would not have been at all strange for a building of that size to be called a castle, rather than a house.\u2018Suits the ruler of the North.\u2019Though Zieghart was just a noble family, they possessed more territory and military force than the kingdom. They were not a part of the Six Kings for nothing.\u2018So, everyone lives there?\u2019Helen had said that, excluding Sylvia and himself, the rest of the direct line family members resided near the main building\u2014close to the head of house.While there must be a reason that Sylvia lived apart from the annex building, he was not told what it was.\u2018They really do all sorts of things.\u2019A child\u2019s skull, initially bared open towards the sky, started closing when they reached four years of age. It was said that a child\u2019s aptitude for mana would not change afterwards.The event that gathered the children with closed skulls, and checked their ability with mana, was the Judgment Ceremony being held that day.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, whatever I am.\u2019Even if his ability was of lowly status, the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 would raise his body and affinity for mana to its best condition. Gifted aptitude or the like were unimportant to him.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia held him up slightly just as he began to slowly spin the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019. He glanced to the side, noticing that they had already reached the entrance of the main building.\u201cWhatever Raon does, Mommy will not mind. You just have to grow healthily.\u201d\u201cOkay. I got it.\u201dHe smiled like a child who knew nothing.\u201cMy son is really the cutest!\u201dShe rubbed her face against his cheek again. He would be unable to move for five minutes if that kept up.\u201cAhem. Milady.\u201d\u201cOh, sorry!\u201dSylvia came to her senses as Helen cleared her throat. It was a relief that she had come with them.\u201cLet us go in. We may have been a little late.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe entered the Lord\u2019s manor while holding onto Raon.\u2018The standards are high.\u2019Perhaps it was because it was the main building, and the Lord\u2019s manor at that. There wasn\u2019t a single normal person inside. There was a bright twinkle in the eyes of not just the soldiers, but the attendants and maids as well.\u201cWe will arrive soon. Hang in there.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dTogether with Sylvia, Raon passed the central corridor of the first floor. An iron gate, large enough for a giant to walk through, stood at the end of it. It was the entrance to the audience chamber where the Judgment Ceremony would be held.\u201cSylvia Zieghart, Raon Zieghart, Helen Carvin. Verified.\u201dThe soldier guarding the audience chamber turned on his heel and opened the door.Cre-ak!Following the dull sound of metal being twisted, a whole new world opened up.A brilliant light poured down from the ceiling, and on there were ornaments\u2014of which the worth could not possibly be fathomed\u2014lining the gold-coloured wall.That room, which made one instinctively think of money, was the audience chamber to meet the head of House Zieghart, Glenn.Boom!With the sound of the door closing, the attention of the people in the room pierced Raon like an arrow.\u201cSylvia? Then that child is Sylvia\u2019s?\u201d\u201cWhat young child has the looks, to such a\u2026\u201d\u201cBlonde, with red eyes.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s small. I heard he had an illness, is that true?\u201d\u201cMust be, since he inherited the blood of a loser.\u201d\u201cIt should be referred to as a failure, not a loser.\u201dPeople whom he had never seen before all paid close attention to Raon. Of course, it was not of the positive sort.Because he was so young, Raon was able to feel the underlying emotions shot at him directly.\u201cTo even let a guy like him enter.\u201d\u201cIs there a need to progress with the Judgment Ceremony for a failure\u2019s son?\u201d\u201cExactly. This is lowering the standards.\u201dThough he did not know who the \u2018loser\u2019 or \u2018failure\u2019 they referenced was, they were very obviously condemning both Sylvia and him.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019Raon wriggled his fists. While he was completely indifferent to being referred to as small, his chest felt tight.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Raon. Just look at me.\u201dSylvia gave him a smile, even after hearing words like \u2018failure\u2019 and \u2018outlaw\u2019 bandied about.\u2018She\u2019s strong, as expected.\u2019Sylvia was a person with a strong mind. At her gentle voice, the throbbing of his heart settled down.\u2018They must be from the collateral line.\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes, which skimmed the interior of the audience chamber once he regained his composure, stopped at the top of the platform.Seven people were sitting on red chairs.They surrounded themselves with an aura on a different level compared to those below and were looking down on the others.\u2018They are in a different league.\u2019If the collateral line below were foxes and wolves, then the direct line on the platform already gave off the presence of a dragon soaring through the sky.While they did not open their mouths like the collateral relatives, they looked down at him and Sylvia as if gazing upon trash.\u2018Seems they are all enemies.\u2019He had just reached the conclusion that it was a broken family when Sylvia headed not towards the top of the platform, but the bottom. And she went straight to the end of it.\u2018It\u2019s strange.\u2019He had many questions.There is, usually, a wall between the direct and collateral lineage that could not be overcome. If it were the direct line, it would not be as strange as the collateral line very obviously provoking a fight.Furthermore, Sylvia lived separately, and could not head up the platform. It was obvious that she was being discriminated against for some reason, even if she was of the direct line.\u2018What\u2019s the reason?\u2019It might be from being called an outlaw and a loser, or because she lost a spar or a war.Clang!As he was considering the reason for the discrimination Sylvia was facing, the soldiers standing outside the door of the audience chamber brought down their spears.\u201cThe head of House Zieghart, ruler of the North. Lord Glenn Zieghart has arrived!\u201dWith that, the large iron doors of the audience chamber opened wide.Glenn Zieghart revealed himself with a domineering shock that rang through the air, at which the very atmosphere seemed to tremble.Gravity seemed to be heavier, and it became difficult to breathe from his arrival alone. A suffocating tension ran through Raon\u2019s spine.\u201cLord Zieghart!\u201dThe dragons looking down from the top of the platform, as well as the wolves who bared their teeth from below, all knelt at the same time.Thump.The sound of his footsteps.With the same hard sound of his footsteps as five years ago, Glenn Zieghart entered. He spread his absolute presence, which weighed down the entirety of the audience chamber, as he sat down on the golden throne in the middle of the platform.\u201cLet us begin.\u201dThe moment he flicked his fingers, a sword burst from the middle of the audience chamber. It was an enormous stone sword, which seemed like it would be difficult for even giants to hold up.\u2018That must be the Sword of Judgment.\u2019The sword, an object from a thousand years ago, was said to be able to identify a person\u2019s aptitude for mana when they put their hands on it.The Judgment Ceremony utilized the stone sword to determine the children\u2019s aptitudes.\u201cFirst, Burren Zieghart.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Lkjgh][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Upon hearing his name called, a boy with blue hair\u2014sitting in the second row on the platform and looking to be around six years old\u2014stood.\u201cPlease put your hand on the sword.\u201dWhen he came down to the platform, the master of the ceremony pointed at the stone sword. Burren nodded his head and placed his hand on it.A green light blossomed from the Burren\u2019s fingertips and enveloped the entire sword, and a thick air bloomed from the hilt.\u201cOoh!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Wind! It\u2019s Wind!\u201d\u201cSeeing as the entire sword lit up, the quality of his mana is also top class!\u201d\u201cIt is truly a talent befitting the child of Lord Karoon!\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u201dThe collaterals standing below the platform sent applause and cheers towards the middle-aged man that had been sitting next to Burren.\u201cIt is an attribute well-suited to a swordsman. Concentrate on feeling the wind from now on.\u201d\u201cYes, I will!\u201dGlenn nodded, and Burren beamed as brightly as a sunflower facing the sun, before returning to his seat.\u201cNext, from the vassal family of Sullion, Runaan Sullion.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA silver-haired girl, who was sitting at the right end of the platform, stood up quietly.Like the nobility serving the King, the vassal families serving Zieghart were great families in the North.Sullion appeared to be on the platform with the direct lineage, as they were the representatives of the vassal families.The girl named Runaan approached the stone sword with calm eyes and placed her hand on it.Cling!The moment her hand touched the sword, a silvery light that looked as if the moon had melted burst out of the blunt sword tip.The light that burst out did not stop at filling up the sword completely, instead traveling up the sword hilt and creating a silver frost around the entire sword.\u201cFrost? And around the whole sword, at that!\u201d\u201cIs it the same level of aptitude as Lord Burren\u2026\u201d\u201cSullion is definitely something.\u201d\u201cYet another genius from the Sullion family.\u201dHowever, the sounds of applause and cheers were not as loud as when it was with Burren. It seemed there was a competitive relationship between the vassal families and the collateral line.\u201cYou have a good attribute. If it can be sharpened like the edge of a knife, it will be able to pierce through anything.\u201dGlenn Zieghart nodded his head at Runaan as well.\u201cThank you.\u201dRunaan bowed her head without a significant change in her expression, and jumped down with the grace of a cat, before returning to her seat.There were two more children from the direct line, collaterals and vassals all put their hands atop the stone sword, but there was no one who had aptitude comparable to Burren or Runaan.\u2018Now I know.\u2019Raon flicked his fingers. As he witnessed the others\u2019 Judgment Ceremony, he could determine what was good and what was bad.\u2018For mana purity, it is how far the light from the blade of the sword travels. As for the mana attribute, it shows from the tip of the hilt.\u2019In the case where the quality of mana was outstanding, the entire sword shone like it did for Runaan or Burren, and the special attributes of mana could be determined through the hilt of the sword.\u201cLastly, Raon Zieghart. Please come forward.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, Raon.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen he nodded his head, Sylvia smiled sweetly and held him up.\u201cYou saw the others do it, right? You just do the same.\u201dSylvia brought him down in front of the stone sword and held out her own hand as if giving a demonstration.\u201cOkay.\u201dHe answered shortly and looked at the stone sword.\u2018It probably won\u2019t be good.\u2019Though the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was Two-Star, the coldness in his mana crcuit remained at a shocking level.Considering his current condition, he would not be able to spread as brilliant a light as the other children.\u201cPhew.\u201dHe slowly breathed out and stretched his hand towards the stone sword.The moment his hand touched the stone sword, a wave broke out in his heart as if a pebble had dropped into a pond. A small whistle extended from his chest and rang through his entire body.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019Just as he was about to remove his hand because of the strange sensation, something flashed in front of his eyes.He saw a blonde man clad in silver armor.There was an uncountable number of monsters crashing towards him, like a wave.\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019Even though it was obviously an illusion, the sensation felt so real that he broke out in a cold sweat.He was unable to breathe properly, hand trembling, when the man picked up the sword.A gold flame burned over the dazzlingly beautiful sword edge.He drew down the sword engulfed by flames like a thunderbolt.At that moment\u2026A golden flame shot out from the earth and covered the entire world.He averted his eyes from the golden flames filling his entire field of vision and shut his eyes. When he opened them again, the world had changed again and there was a message in front of himYou are cultivating the <Ring of Fire (Two-Stars)>.You have not acquired ???.Not enough achievement.When he tilted his head at the indecipherable message, a light burst from the stone sword.The light that had started traveling up violently, lost its strength and stopped at the middle of the sword.There was no special ability or high purity like the others. He was of the aptitude that fell short of even the collateral line, let alone the direct lineage.\u201cDone already?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even reach the middle?\u201d\u201cHahaha! Isn\u2019t it the first time we\u2019re seeing something so little?\u201d\u201cThe quality of mana is bad, and it is white, so there\u2019s no ability either.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing other than his looks.\u201d\u201cSeems like the God of War doesn\u2019t look over the child of an outlaw, as expected.\u201dThose of the direct line that witnessed the Judgment Ceremony scrunched up their faces, while those of the collateral line openly sneered.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn, who had provided short advice to the direct and collateral lineage, did not open his mouth either.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dRaon let out a soft sigh.He was used to being disregarded. It had already been a long time since he threw away his emotions. He had been raised as not a human, but a dog, and was indoctrinated further. He could accept criticisms or insults any time.He was going to take what he could and leave anyway. He did not want to care about what would happen.Though Sylvia and the maids treated him as real family, that sentiment did not change.But at that very moment, he was in a strangely subdued mood.Seeing them ridiculing not just him, but also Sylvia and Helen as well, his heart throbbed as if electrocuted.\u2018Alright.\u2019Raon clenched his teeth. Sylvia and the maids were the first people to ever treat him as a human being.He pledged to show the direct and collateral lines that sneered at him that bestowed talent was insignificant.\u201cI participate in the Judgment Ceremony all the time, but this is my first time seeing that kind of level.\u201d\u201cIs he really a Zieghart?\u201d\u201cSo, the talent that Sylvia had has gone to waste. There\u2019s nothing in him other than the fact that he is blonde with red eyes, like the head of house.\u201dHe remembered each and every one of their faces, those that babbled on unthinkingly.\u201cStop.\u201dThe entire audience chamber froze at that single word from Glenn.\u201cThis is the end of the Judgment Ceremony. Everyone is to leave.\u201d\u201cMy lord?\u201d\u201cDo I have to repeat myself?\u201d\u201cAll of you are dismissed.\u201dWhen Karoon Zieghart\u2014Glenn\u2019s second son\u2014stood up, the others furtively glanced around before leaving the audience chamber. All while quietly mumbling a curse at Raon and Sylvia, of course.Less than five minutes later, the only people remaining in the audience chamber were Glenn Zieghart, who was the owner of the room, and his Chief Butler, Roenn.\u201cIt cannot be helped.\u201dGlenn calmly nodded as he stared at the Sword of Judgment set in the middle of the room.\u201cLord Zieghart\u2026.\u201dJust as Roenn was about to approach him\u2026Crackle!A light burst from the bottom of the Sword of Judgment, traveling beyond the sword edge to the end of the hilt.The light was of a golden color, as saturated as the sun, and a blazing fire was burning at the end of the sword hilt.\u201cGolden flames?\u201dA storm raged in Glenn\u2019s eyes for the first time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That door was the Zieghart repository, which could only be summoned by the Lord of the House. It was the first time in ten years that Glenn had summoned that door.\u201cI shall return later.\u201dAs Glenn raised his hand, the golden iron door opened smoothly.He turned around to check the golden flames burning over the sword once more, before entering the repository.The repository was heaped with innumerable treasures.Elixirs and weapons of the highest level, gems that could buy a whole castle, and various books. They were treasures that could incite war throughout the continent should they be exposed.Neither weapons nor gemstones, nor the neatly stacked elixirs that fervently revealed themselves attracted Glenn\u2019s attention.He went straight towards the large bookcase, deep within the repository.The cylindrical bookcase shot up at the end of the repository as if it were a World Tree, and there were various books of all sorts on every shelf.Tap.When Glenn lightly kicked the floor, his body began to rise into the air. He stepped through the air and headed towards the first shelf of the bookcase.The first shelf was unlike the others, and only had two books.He tried to grab and take the old and yellow book in front of him. However, the book was unmovable, as if pinned down by a boulder.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t move, as expected.\u201dGlenn clicked his tongue and took the red book right next to it.The second book fell out smoothly, unlike the first one, and there was no problem reading it as it was preserved very well.Tap tap.Glenn was flipping through the book when his hands suddenly stopped.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe frowned as he read the words on the page.\u201cThe aura of the first leader of Zieghart had a golden color like the sun, and its tremendous firepower was capable of melting devildom\u2019s flames\u2026\u201dGlenn closed his eyes, recalling the golden flame that Raon summoned.\u201cGolden mana, golden flame.\u201dYellow aura wasn\u2019t uncommon. But there was only one occurrence of mana with a dark gold color throughout the history of Zieghart.\u201cRaon, what on earth\u2026?\u201d***\u201cMommy is sorry.\u201dAs soon as Sylvia entered the annex building, she hugged Raon tighter than usual\u2014to the point that it was difficult to breathe.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dNoticing Sylvia\u2019s back trembling, Raon patted her shoulders.\u2018I\u2019m not sure yet.\u2019In his previous life, he didn\u2019t know what emotions were.He killed if he was asked to kill, he kidnapped if he was asked to kidnap, he stole if he was asked to steal. There were only relationships of order and obedience, a handler and a dog.However, it was different now.Sylvia, Helen, and the maids gave to him unconditionally, without anything in return.It was the first life where he only received, so he couldn\u2019t explain what type of emotion the tingling sensation that he was experiencing in his chest was.But there was one thing he knew.He didn\u2019t want Sylvia or the maids to cry. Even if they couldn\u2019t always smile, he didn\u2019t want them to be sad.\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have felt anything if they had laughed at me, instead.\u2019However, the people at lord\u2019s manor laughed at Sylvia.The collaterals under the platform blatantly cackled, and the direct line on the platform frowned as if they were observing a hateful bug.\u2018I will show them.\u2019Everyone who laughed at Sylvia would be taught a lesson. Their nasty behavior would be returned in full.***It was a sunny afternoon.A young boy was sitting on the grass in the garden.With his dark blonde hair fluttering in the wind, his facial features had a nearly perfect proportion, despite looking childlike.If there was one flaw, it would\u2019ve been the way his pale face suggested his poor health.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dThe boy, who had stayed seated for a long time with his eyes closed, finally opened his eyes.\u2018I\u2019m about to have three rings of fire.\u2019Raon smiled slightly. He had already grown enough to be called a young boy, rather than a child.\u2018It has already been seven years.\u2019Seven years had passed since the first Judgment Ceremony, and he was now twelve years old.Thanks to his regular training, the two rings of fire were about to become three.\u2018It\u2019s a bit sad.\u2019If the coldness wasn\u2019t spread throughout his body, he would\u2019ve already gotten three stars. But training alongside the coldness inevitably slowed down his progress.Still, it wasn\u2019t all in vain.\u2018Status window.\u2019He thought the now-familiar words to himself.<Status Window>Name: Raon ZieghartTitle: NoneState:\u00a0 Curse of Frost (Nine Strands), Poor Stamina, Decline in Athletic Ability, Decline in Mana AffinityTrait: ???, Ring of Fire (Two-Star), Water Resistance (Two-Star)*Additional Abilities have not been unlocked.His water resistance had reached two stars, and the symptoms of his hand and feet becoming stiff had vanished once the \u2018Cold Body\u2019 disappeared from \u2018state\u2019.It was still difficult to move his body because of his other constitutions, but the problem would be solved naturally once the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 reached a higher star rating.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon closed the status window and stood up on the grass.\u2018I need to start physical training now\u2026\u2019Sylvia and the maids worried less now since he didn\u2019t get cold as easily, but they would always stop him whenever he tried to move his body.Since physical training was necessary to reach the higher star of \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, he needed to find a way to train without hiding.\u2018Is there any way that I can train openly?\u2019He could force it, but it was difficult to go against Sylvia. Even though she didn\u2019t give him any orders, he had no choice but to obey her.\u201cYoung master!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *While he was pondering what to do, Helen came running out of the annex building.\u201cWhat are you doing?

If you didn\u2019t see his golden hair and red eyes, you\u2019d believe that he\u2019s from another family.\u201d\u201cThat handsome appearance is the only thing he has that befits Zieghart.\u201d\u201cHis pale face doesn\u2019t look that handsome, though?\u201dIt was as expected. Just as always, those of the direct line ignored him as if they had no interest in him, and the collaterals were whispering sarcastically.\u2018It\u2019s a relief.\u2019They were still laughing at him and Sylvia. He felt rather satisfied at their unchanging attitude.\u2018Joanna, Henry, Denier\u2026\u2019Looking around from top to bottom of the platform, he reiterated the names of direct line and collaterals.Lord Glenn Zieghart entered after about thirty minutes of waiting, sitting at the backmost seat under the platform.He was as dignified as seven years ago. No, he was even more dignified than before. Glenn went to the platform and began the Judgment Ceremony.Because there were only children from collaterals and vassals who went through the Judgment Ceremony this time, the ceremony didn\u2019t even last three hours.He ignored the mocking words that he heard, comparing him with the collateral children with high mana purity.\u201cToday\u2019s Judgment Ceremony is now over. Thank you for\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dGlenn raised his hand to interrupt the moderator, who was about to announce the end of the ceremony.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dThe gaze directed at Raon for the first time was that of an absolute being, one who sat on the throne to overlook the world.The room fell silent, and everyone\u2019s attention fixated on him.\u2018Me?\u2019Raon swallowed. He was confused because he didn\u2019t think he was going to be called.\u201cMy\u2026 My lord?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSylvia shook her head in panic, and Helen held her hand tightly.\u201cYou must\u2019ve received the order to participate in the basic training, as a member of the family. Why have you not responded when it\u2019s already been a month?\u201d\u2018Participating in the basic training?\u2019He had never received such a thing. When he looked next to him, he saw Sylvia biting her lips. She must have known.\u201cMy\u2026 My lord. Raon is different from other children. He still has coldness in his body\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no exception nor refusal for one who has received the name of Zieghart.\u201d\u201cHe has difficulties walking normally. He won\u2019t be able to handle the training.\u201dSylvia firmly shook her head.\u201cIf you can\u2019t walk, then crawl and train. That is Zieghart.\u201dResting his chin on his right hand, Glenn closed his eyes.\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t accept it. No, please give me some time\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t accept it, are you going to run away once again? Along with that child?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201dHe could feel Sylvia\u2019s hand getting wet, as she was grabbing his right hand.\u201cIn this land, you can only live as a Zieghart. If you don\u2019t like it, then get out.\u201dGlenn\u2019s voice was cold, as if they weren\u2019t related by blood.\u201cIsn\u2019t she going to run away again at this rate?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s going to be amusing, but she doesn\u2019t have an energy center nor a mana circuit to break anymore.\u201d\u201cTo think such a person is from the direct line, tut tut.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dObserving Sylvia, Glenn, and everyone in the room, Raon calmed down his glare.\u2018I get it now.\u2019He could understand the reason Sylvia received this kind of treatment, despite being from the direct line. The reason that she was looked down upon by not only the direct line but also the collateral\u2026\u2018It\u2019s because she left the household.\u2019She didn\u2019t have an aura, despite having learned martial arts. That meant that she had either broken her energy center, or had never learned to use aura, and the former appeared to be the case.She must have broken her energy center and her mana circuit and left the household, where she met Father and married him.\u2018And she must have returned reluctantly because father died after she got pregnant with me.\u2019It was understandable.Because she threw away her position in the direct line and came back, she received inferior treatment than a member of the collateral line.\u2018However.\u2019That was other people\u2019s point of view, and their circumstances. As Sylvia\u2019s son, Raon couldn\u2019t bear her treatment.Tap.Raon released Sylvia\u2019s hand and took a step forward.\u201cY-young master!\u201d\u201cRaon, Mommy will take care of it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dAfter shaking his head at them, he stood in front of Glenn.\u201cMy lord, I will participate in the training starting next month, as you have commanded.\u201dFacing his gaze, which looked like he was looking at a bug rather than his grandson, Raon lowered his head.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t even know that there was training.\u201dGlenn\u2019s third son, Uncle Denier Zieghart, spoke. He was the only person among the direct line who looked apologetic.\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cDespite what it is called, basic training isn\u2019t on a level that a patient can manage. You should withdraw for now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dRaon looked at Glenn, instead of Denier.\u201cI\u2019ve received the name Zieghart, so I shall pay for it. I will participate in training.\u201dBecause his resolute voice wasn\u2019t befitting a child, people\u2019s gazes changed.They seemed to recognize him as a small pebble, but that was enough for now.He had the experience of becoming the greatest assassin, starting as a hunting dog at the rock bottom, and he could use the legendary \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.Becoming the best in the household wasn\u2019t an impossible feat, not if he made use of his abilities.His revenge would be delayed? No. This way could end up being quicker.Raon clenched his small fist.\u2018I will show you how hard the pebble that you look down on is.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it felt as though his heart was being squeezed.He could feel his clothes become sticky because of the cold sweat he broke into. If he hadn\u2019t practiced the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, he might have fainted already.\u2018Is this the warrior, the Destructive King of the North\u2026?\u2019Considering his gaze alone held such pressure, his prowess surpassed Derus Robert. It was impossible to raise his head.\u201cTry saying it again. Can you take responsibility for what you\u2019ve just said?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026 my lord! Raon is still young. He doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true! Raon has lived in the annex building all this time, so he doesn\u2019t know about the name of Zieghart\u2026\u201dSylvia and Helen ran next to him and knelt.\u201cMy lord, he is just a child who doesn\u2019t know anything. Please withdraw your pressure.\u201dDenier Zieghart stood up and defended them against the pressure.\u201cSir Denier!\u201d\u201cAs expected of Sir Denier, he would even care for an insolent kid like him.\u201d\u201cThe broadness of his mind is even greater than his might.\u201dThe collaterals praised Denier\u2019s behavior.\u201cI am speaking right now.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dDenier and Sylvia both stepped back at once, hearing Glenn\u2019s mighty voice. They didn\u2019t move on their own; Glenn pushed them back with his voice alone.\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry.\u201dDenier lowered his head, but Sylvia was different.\u201cF-father\u2026\u201dShe approached Glenn, enduring his pressure with her frail body, which didn\u2019t even possess aura.\u201cRaon is not yet ready to train\u2026\u201dSylvia\u2019s eyes reflected that she was solely worried about him.It pulled at Raon\u2019s heartstrings.\u2018I don\u2019t understand.\u2019He was choked up, but he couldn\u2019t tell if that emotion meant compassion, or worry, or something else.He just wished that she would always smile happily, instead of being in that state.\u2018I was an assassin.\u2019An assassin was a being that lived in the darkness. Being closer to death than life, they would never show themselves.\u2018However, I no longer am one.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not going to live as an assassin anymore.\u2019As Raon Zieghart, and not as Raon the assassin, he resolved that he would return Sylvia to her original place.Crash!At that moment, he could hear a sound similar to one of the chains around his neck falling.\u201cI do not know.\u201dRaon forced himself to raise his head, facing Glenn\u2019s overbearing gaze directly. Suppressing the urge to close his eyes, he continued.\u201cI\u2019ve been raised in the annex building, and not in the main building. I don\u2019t know how high and mighty Zieghart is.\u201d\u201cR-Raon!\u201dSylvia desperately called for him, but he didn\u2019t look back.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to see for myself what kind of place is Zieghart, by participating in training.\u201dOnce Raon finished talking, everyone held their breath and looked at Glenn.\u201c\u2026\u201dOne of Glenn\u2019s eyebrows raised slightly.\u201cDo you mean that you will judge Zieghart from basic training?\u201d\u201cThat is the only way I can learn about Zieghart right now.\u201d\u201cThen I will have to make sure that the instructor is fully prepared, so that you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201dThe room of audience became as quiet as a mouse, as Glenn\u2019s red eyes blazed.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dBeing unable to withstand it any further, Raon finally bowed his head. He was only twelve years old, a child who couldn\u2019t endure a thousandth of Glenn\u2019s pressure.Yet he didn\u2019t give in.If he kept cultivating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, and learned an efficient way of handling aura, he would be able to properly stand in front of him one day.Deciding that he would show that with action instead of word, he clenched his teeth.\u2018One day.\u2019***Once everyone had left, only Glenn and his butler Roenn remained in the silent audience chamber.\u201cDid you see?\u201d\u201cYes, I saw it clearly.\u201dRoenn nodded his head firmly in response to Glenn\u2019s question.\u201cThat boy sure is something.\u201dThe corners of Glenn\u2019s mouth lifted.\u201cA twelve-year-old child that confidently talks back while withstanding my pressure. I have never seen something like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing it, as well.\u201dRoenn smiled, tidying his hair.\u201cNot only his appearance, but his spirit is also just like my lord\u2019s in his childhood.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say strange things.\u201dGlenn snorted, as if telling him to stop spouting nonsense, but the corners of his mouth lifted even more\u2014like a leaf blowing in the wind.\u201cAre you going to increase the difficulty of basic training?\u201d\u201cI shall, because many people have heard.\u201d\u201cCan young master Raon really pass?\u201d\u201cParticipating would already be difficult.\u201dGlenn shook his head without hesitation.\u201cHis condition is better thanks to the elixir, but neither his constitution nor his health is good enough. Maybe he can once he recovers a bit more, but it\u2019s impossible for now.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already mentioned it. There are no exceptions for those inheriting the name of Zieghart.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dRoen licked his lips.\u2018He is still not honest.\u2019He could tell, as he had been with him for several dozen years. The reason Glenn called for Raon wasn\u2019t to pressure him, but to protect him by showing others that he didn\u2019t discriminate against him.Once Raon failed the training, he would probably give him an elixir and pretend to spare the rod and spoil the child.Although even Glenn shouldn\u2019t have expected Raon to come forth.\u201cI like young master Raon\u2019s personality, but one thing worries me.\u201d\u201cIt must be about the collateral and direct line\u2019s children.\u201d\u201cYes. They won\u2019t have a considerable reaction, but he will be noticed in a way he hasn\u2019t been before. He withstood my lord\u2019s pressure, albeit a small amount. Measures should be\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no need to provoke them. Just watch over him.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRoenn nodded immediately, despite his opinion being different, because Glenn was like a god to him.\u201cMy lord, may I ask a question?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cIf, by some chance, Raon manages to pass the basic training\u2026 What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cPass?\u201dResting his chin on his hand, Glenn recalled the Judgment Ceremony from seven years ago.\u2018Golden flame.\u2019He wasn\u2019t sure if it was a coincidence or an accident, but Raon set ablaze the golden flame that only the first head of Zieghart could use.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. However, if there is a one in ten thousandth chance that it could happen\u2026\u201dHe smirked and stood from the throne.\u201cI will have to reward him accordingly.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Upon entering the annex building, Raon was immediately dragged into Sylvia\u2019s room.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia firmly grasped Raon\u2019s shoulders.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cZieghart\u2019s training doesn\u2019t go easy on children. Your current health won\u2019t be able to handle it. You will just get hurt.\u201dSylvia\u2019s voice was faint. Her worries for him made her hands tremble.\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure what emotion made me act like that.\u201dRaon closed his eyes. It was true. Despite living with Sylvia and Helen for twelve years, his emotions were still light, like a pastel blue color.\u201cBut my chest tightens whenever Mom gets scorned in the main building. That\u2019s why I wanted to say something.\u201dBecause he didn\u2019t want to lie to Sylvia and Helen, Raon replied honestly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master Raon.\u201dSylvia\u2019s lips parted, and Helen\u2019s lips trembled.\u201cSigh.\u201dSylvia released his shoulders and slowly closed, then opened, her eyes.\u201cRaon, thank you for your consideration. However, you are still young. You don\u2019t need to be so thoughtful, not when you are at an age where you should be pampered.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u201cYou might not know, but Mommy is pretty strong. I can endure a lot more.\u201dSylvia bit her tongue to stop her tears from spilling over.\u2018To such a child\u2026\u2019Raon was too kind to her. As if he noticed the atmosphere in the household, he didn\u2019t act like a spoiled child. He endured by himself, even while sick.Because he was such a kind and considerate child, she couldn\u2019t let him bring hardship upon himself.\u201cMommy will talk to Grandfather. If I ask him to postpone the training for just a single year, even he would\u2026\u201d\u201cI will try\u2026 No, I can do it.\u201dRaon shook his head. He did stand up for Sylvia, but there was also another reason.Basic training was an opportunity for him to train without being considerate to Sylvia and Helen. It would\u2019ve been absurd to throw away this chance.\u201cIt\u2019s true. I can do it, so trust me.\u201d\u201cWhether you can do it or not isn\u2019t important! The problem is that your health can get worse.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes, seeing Sylvia\u2019s worried gaze.\u2018That\u2019s what she meant.\u2019Their point of view was different.He was talking about being able to handle the training, and Sylvia was worrying about his health.Because only the results were important when he was an assassin, he didn\u2019t understand Sylvia\u2019s heart.\u201cThen I will give up as soon as my health becomes worse.\u201dIn order to lessen Sylvia\u2019s worries, he gave her a new answer.\u201cYou don\u2019t even say anything when you are sick. How am I supposed to trust you?\u201d\u201cI promise.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dSylvia grabbed her head and sighed.\u201cLady Sylvia, how about trying to believe in young master Raon for once?\u201d\u201cHelen, you should also know what kind of child Raon is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that the training is harsh, but the current head instructor has the best insight in Zieghart.\u00a0 He should be aware of the young master\u2019s condition, so he will stop him before it gets any worse.\u201d\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dSylvia sighed at Helen\u2019s words, and gently looked down at him.\u201cRaon, can you really promise? You must tell me as soon as anything feels weird in your body, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dRaon nodded firmly.\u201cI will believe you this once.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cHowever, I can\u2019t sit here doing nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll visit the fifth training ground. I need to give them a warning, at least.\u201dAfter saying that, she ran from the room.\u201cYoung master Raon.\u201dOnce Sylvia left, Helen knelt and met his eyes.\u201cNever, never push yourself! If it becomes difficult, you must give up immediately. Do you understand me?\u201d\u201cI understand. You\u2019ve already said it multiple times.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t enough, even if I say several thousands of times, let alone multiple times. Young master must remember that you are weaker than other children and abandon your overconfidence.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dBecause Helen was just as worried as Sylvia, he simply nodded.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m never going to be the one to give up first.\u2019Even if he died from his lungs exploding, he wasn\u2019t going to stop. The higher the difficulty, the higher the level the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 would grow. It would make both his mind and body stronger.***Raon headed to the small garden behind the annex building.\u201cIt feels so empty after visiting the main building.\u201dUnlike the main building, which had multiple facilities\u2014including an expansive training ground and a fashionable garden\u2014the annex building only had a small garden and a lake.It was so small that it was impossible to train without being noticed by Sylvia, but it was still an elegant place.Raon sat down on the chair in the garden.\u2018The training should be quite difficult.\u2019Just as Sylvia and Helen worried, his body was still not perfect. Coldness remained in his mana circuit, his development was slow, and his stamina was lacking.Considering how widespread the notorious Zieghart training was, it was safe to assume that even a child\u2019s basic training was going to be difficult.However, he had the memories from his past life, where he went through a hell worse than that. With that memory, he was never going to crumble.\u2018This is the real beginning.\u2019If learning the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was the preparation of the land, then the training he\u2019d begin next month was the foundation work to build a house.In order to construct a tall building later, the foundation needed to be solid.\u201cI will show them.\u201d\u2018I will accomplish a greater achievement than anyone else from the direct line, so that everyone who laughed at us will shut their mouth.\u2019\u2018And that bastard, Derus Robert.\u2019His revenge would be delayed a little, but his real objective was Derus Robert, the Sky Sword Saint.Until the day he unmasked him and cut his throat, he would never stop.\u201cHaaaah\u2026\u201dAfter looking at the golden sun setting down to the western mountain, he closed his eyes and took the mana into his body.The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 surrounding his heart started spinning violently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zieghart owned multiple powerful armed organizations, befitting their reputation as ruler of the north.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that he was a patient, one who can\u2019t even move properly?\u201d\u201cMany maids heard the conversation between the Ragged Saint and my lord. He is suffering from a severe illness, for sure.\u201d\u201cI have heard that as well. Just like the last time I saw him, his body wasn\u2019t normal today, either. However\u2026\u201dKaroon Zieghart tapped the desk, which caused not only the desk, but also the whole office, to tremble.\u201cHe withstood Father\u2019s pressure.\u201dThe pressure that Glenn had emitted at the ceremony could be compared to a firefly, while his full pressure was like the sun.However, a twelve-year-old, and a sickly one at that, managed to withstand it. It was an unbelievable sight, despite seeing it with his own eyes.\u201cWould Burren have been able to withstand it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was no response, as Karoon seemed to be talking to himself.\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t.\u201dBurren was his son, who had started to train at the age of seven, and he had frequently fed him high quality elixirs.And even with such an upbringing, Burren wouldn\u2019t have withstood his father\u2019s pressure. So the fact that Raon did kept bothering him.\u201cSylvia was also very talented, more than anyone.\u201dShe was disabled because of her energy center and mana circuit breaking, but her talent was undisputable.\u201cIs it possible to send someone to the annex building?\u201d\u201cIt will take some time, but it\u2019s possible.\u201dThe butler, who was waiting in front of the door, nodded.\u201cThen do it.\u201dKaroon turned away with sparkling eyes.\u201cReport everything that happens there.\u201d***Raon left his room before morning light. After a quick warm up in the garden, he started running near the annex building.He had said that he would work out in preparation for the training, so no one should\u2019ve bothered him.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dAlthough he hadn\u2019t been running for a long time, he was already out of breath. His body was much weaker than in his previous life.\u201cHaah.\u201dHe held his breath as he got short of breath. He handled the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 while focusing on the simple action of inhaling through his nose and exhaling through his mouth.Nature\u2019s mana was entwined in each breath that passed his lips.The mana particles, which were fluttering like pollen, ran through his mana circuits to give vitality to his body and suppress the emerging coldness.\u2018It\u2019s a good flow.\u2019Raon nodded. The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was most effective when combined with physical activities. That was why he was able to handle the mana at a level and purity much more superior than usual.\u201cHuuu\u2026\u201dHis clothes were wet with sweat, and he felt burnt out. However, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling from the vitality the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was generating.\u201cRaon!\u201dWhile he was trying to focus more on the bliss of training that stimulated his whole body, Sylvia\u2019s head poked out of the window that burst open.\u201cWhy are you overdoing it from the first day?\u201d\u201cHuff\u2026 huff\u2026\u201dRaon slowed his steps and started panting.\u201cYou\u2019re sweating so much! That was way too much!\u201d\u201cIt\u2026 It just started.\u201dBreathing heavily, he lowered his head.\u2018It wasn\u2019t a bother. She did well stopping me.\u2019Sylvia was correct this time. He was more like a patient, so he would\u2019ve gotten sick if he kept running, despite the vitality from the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018I still have plenty of time.\u2019There was still a month before the start of basic training.It was enough time to raise the two-star \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 up to three-star, so he needed to proceed slowly, without haste.\u201cI\u2019m going to rest in my room.\u201d\u201cHow is your body? Does it feel bad anywhere?\u201dHe shook his head at Sylvia, who was looking around his body with concerned eyes.\u201cNo. I think I need to stop for today and rest.\u201d\u201cIf you overdo it again tomorrow, I\u2019m going to forbid you from training.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dRaon smiled lightly and went to his room.\u2018Now, I shall practice with the vertical ring.\u2019The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 that rotated horizontally developed the body, while the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 that rotated vertically developed the mind.He had been practicing with the horizontal \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 up to that point, so it was time to practice with the vertical one.Raon closed his eyes while sitting on the floor. He took in nature\u2019s mana with a greater mental focus than when he was running.Bzzt!A flimsy shadow started to form next to the two rings of fire that were rotating around his heart.***Glenn Zieghart left the lord\u2019s manor and headed to the fifth training ground, alone.Upon entering, he could see the instructors strengthening the yellow ground that hundreds of trainees would use.\u201cGreeting my lord!\u201dGlenn waved his hand to the instructors\u2019 greetings and entered the head instructor\u2019s room, located on the periphery of the training ground.There was a rocking chair in the middle of the messy room, and a man was lying on top of it as if he was dead, a straw hat covering his face.\u201cStop pretending to sleep and get up.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe man on the rocking chair took off his straw hat with a cloudy voice. The handsome man, appearing to be about twenty years old, got up while yawning. His red hair was loose around his face.His ears, which pointed up like blades of grass, were different from a humans\u2019. His mysterious appearance seemed otherworldly.With a beautiful appearance and pointy ears, the head instructor of the fifth training ground wasn\u2019t a human, but an elf\u2014the race of nature.\u201cMy lord is the only person against whom my sleeping technique doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cThe other instructors are busy hardening the ground, yet the head instructor\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are merely following my orders. I\u2019m working with my brain, and they are working with their body, so it\u2019s fair.\u2019\u201cRimmer, it\u2019s been fifty years, but you are still so childish.\u201d\u201cLike the saying goes, humans never change. Oops, I\u2019m an elf.\u201dThe elf named Rimmer stood from his chair, giggling.\u201cWhy did you bestow your presence upon me today? Is it because of your youngest grandson, by any chance?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWithout responding, Glenn stared at Rimmer. As comrades in arms, they seemed to understand what each other was thinking just from meeting each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cSylvia came to beg, but I didn\u2019t expect my lord to also come.\u201d\u201cDid Sylvia?\u201d\u201cShe asked me to take care of Raon, so that he won\u2019t get hurt. If my lord also came to make such a request, then you\u2019ve wasted your time.\u201dRimmer\u2019s playful green eyes became dispirited.\u201cMy lord said that, even as the head of the house, you wouldn\u2019t interfere with this training ground. I\u2019m not going to make any exceptions, even if he is your youngest grandson.\u201d\u201cThen so be it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201dRimmer\u2019s jaw dropped as Glenn nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t lower the training\u2019s intensity, and raise it as much as you want instead, so that a weakling would drop out.\u201d\u201cYou want me to increase the intensity, instead of decreasing it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen your grandson will fail\u2026 ah!\u201dRimmer clapped his hands and smiled.\u201cWow, it looks like you love your grandson more than I thought. The love that you couldn\u2019t give to Sylvia is now going to that child\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you weren\u2019t my comrade in arms, your head would be flying right now.\u201d\u201cUhuhu!\u201dWith a creepy grin, he touched his neck.\u201cClearly discriminate gems from pebbles, so that only those who deserve it can receive your training.\u201d\u201cAre you asking me to do a selection test?\u201d\u201cUse whatever method you prefer.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dGlenn left the place as Rimmer saluted. The instructors were still strengthening the ground as he left.\u201c\u2026\u201dGlenn looked in the western direction where the annex building was located, then turned around to walk towards the lord\u2019s manor. His steps looked heavier than usual.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon was sitting in his room with his closed eyes.

Even though he had barely reached that stage, he could feel the huge improvement in his mind and body.\u2018The status window must have played a crucial role as well.\u2019The magical message and status window were probably helping the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 become way more effective than in his previous life.\u2018One strand of the Curse of Frost has disappeared, as well.\u2019He stood and casually moved his body. Feeling as light as a feather, he was confident that he could handle basic training, no matter how difficult it was.\u2018No, it\u2019s more than that.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just about handling the training. He felt like he wouldn\u2019t even lose to the so-called genius children of Zieghart.\u201cHm?\u201dWhile he was so thrilled about it, his stomach rumbled. He realized that he had skipped both lunch and dinner.\u2018Shall I go eat?\u2019He left the room and made his way to the dining room. Inside the dimly lit dining room, Sylvia was sitting at the table.\u201cWhy is mom here at this hour\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting so I can eat with my son.\u201dSylvia smiled and patted the chair next to her.\u201cBut it\u2019s late.\u201dAlthough it was way past dinnertime, since he had been forming his third ring of fire, Sylvia pulled out the chair while smiling.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Sit down, quick.\u201dRaon sat down next to Sylvia with an awkward expression on his face.\u201cHelen.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHelen\u2019s voice could be heard from the kitchen. Soon after, the maids brought out the food, all of which were his favorites.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia smiled awkwardly, all while pushing dishes towards him.\u201cMommy has something to tell you today.\u201d\u201cSomething to tell me?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dShe nodded and stayed silent for a while.\u201cBecause Raon is smart, you must\u2019ve thought it was weird. Why do we live separately, and why do others insult us?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dRaon put down the fork he was holding. It looked like Sylvia wanted to tell him about the past before training began.Even though he had a rough idea of what it was, he pretended that he didn\u2019t.\u201cMommy is a criminal. Despite running away from her responsibilities, she returned and begged for her life.\u201dThe start of Sylvia\u2019s story was heavier than he thought.She fell in love with his father, who she happened to meet during her mission. In order to be with him, an average knight, she ran away from the household after breaking her mana circuit and energy center.\u201cActually, you had a big sister. She was two years older than you and was named Shia.\u201d\u201cThen, my big sister is\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHer voice became more subdued, like flowing water at the bottom floor of an underground cavern.\u201cA cadre from \u2018Eden\u2019 recognized my face and attacked us. There was nothing we could do, as your father wasn\u2019t that strong, and I was pregnant with you.\u201dEden was one of the Five Demons that opposed the Six Kings, where Zieghart belongs. Despite its warm name, it was a monstrous organization with lots of strong people, even more than the kingdom itself.\u201cThen how did Mom return?\u201d\u201cMy father had secretly assigned a guard for me. Because they stayed away from us, they only managed to arrive after your father and sister were killed.\u201d\u201cGrandfather did?\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes. He couldn\u2019t have imagined that the cold-blooded Glenn would have assigned a guard.\u201cThat\u2019s why Mommy is a criminal in this household. I really have no excuse for your grandfather.\u2019Sylvia lowered her head, and Helen and the maids clenched their fists.\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon gently looked at Sylvia.\u2018Selfish.\u2019Sylvia was selfish. She ran away from her household\u2019s responsibility for her own happiness and came back to beg for her life.It was understandable why both the direct and collateral lines treated her so harshly.\u2018However\u2026\u2019She was the one who gave him a new life, and a love that he had never felt before.Even if everyone else called her selfish, she was the only mother he had ever known\u2014throughout two lives.\u201cMom.\u201dSylvia raised her head as Raon called her name.\u201cDo you regret it?\u2019\u201cRegret?\u201d\u201cDo you want to return to before you left the household?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t regret it.\u201dSylvia firmly shook her head. She said that she lived like a human for the first time after meeting father and my sister, contrary to how she had lived like an invisible person in her household.\u201cBut I\u2019m sorry for what I did to you. Because your mom is such a bad person\u2026\u201d\u201cWere you happy?\u201d\u201cYes. I was happy back then, and I\u2019m also happy now.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cRa-Raon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201dRaon smiled and grabbed the fork once again.\u2018It\u2019s okay to be selfish.\u2019It was fine if others called her selfish. Even if they called her a runaway, a coward, it was okay if she got insulted.\u2018But I\u2019m going to take it all back.\u2019The position of Zieghart\u2019s direct line, which she had lost. He decided that he would first get that position back to her, before finishing the revenge that he planned to get.Sylvia sobbed.\u201cYoung master Raon\u2026\u201dAs a teardrop fell from Sylvia\u2019s big eyes, Helen and other maids who standing next to them also started to silently cry.Rattle.Inside the annex building\u2019s dining room, the rattling of tableware and sniffing sounds formed an unusual harmony.***After sending Sylvia and the maids back with puffy eyes, Raon returned to his room.\u2018I should check before going to sleep.\u2019It seemed to be a good idea to clean his mind and body with the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, which had become three-star, before sleeping.Whir.The rings surrounding his heart rotated and throbbed, as if they were alive.It certainly looked like the three stars made the rings rotate faster, and the effects on his body and mind were further enhanced.\u2018This is good.\u2019Three stars were so effective, despite being the start of the apprentice stage, so it was worth looking forward to how impressive the intermediate stage was going to be.Raon rotated the rings of fire five times, then went to bed. Just as he was about to close his eyes, after turning off the lights, messages that he had never seen before appeared.Trait <???> has been activated.Trait <Wrath> has been created.<Wrath> awakens.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It must have been the <Wrath> from the message.Flash.A blue flame ignited before his eyes as he stayed vigilant.From the fist-sized flame, a terrifying wave emerged, resembling the eminence of a volcanic eruption.Finally.From the inside of the blue flame, a chilly voice sounded. It sent shivers down his spine. A madness that could explode at any moment was contained in the voice.\u201cWhat is this\u2026?\u201dHe had a considerable amount of knowledge due to his previous life, but he had never heard nor seen a talking flame.The wrath that you have nurtured has reached the King of Essence. Under the name of the second monarch of devildom, Wrath, I will grant your revenge. Offer your mind and body\u2026 Hmm?The blue flame that introduced himself as Wrath, the monarch of devildom, dropped its jaws after looking him up and down.A child? Why is a child\u2026?\u201cWhat are you?\u201dWho are you ? The wrath that reached me wasn\u2019t an emotion that a child still wet behind his ears could possess.Wrath\u2019s voice was low but contained turbulent feelings.\u201cWrath?\u201dRaon frowned. He might have felt it in his previous life, but he had never been infuriated in his current life.\u2018Hold on, previous life?\u2019When he thought about it, he had obtained the mysterious ability called status window after being reincarnated with the memories of his previous life. That had occurred\u00a0after\u00a0he had died.He came to the realization that it could\u2019ve been Wrath that gave him those special abilities.\u201cWas it you who gave me the status window?\u201dStatus window? You can use it?\u201cYes.\u201dNonsense! Hmm?The blue flame surrounding Wrath convulsed.The\u2026 The connection was lost! Why\u2026\u201cWho are you, and why did you show up here?\u201dYou are the one who called the King of Essence.\u201cI called you?\u201dYou blazed out in anger. You said you would kill someone at any cost. The advent of the King of Essence was to grant your wish.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHe remembered swearing he would kill Derus Robert at any cost. From what he said, it looked like the flame had appeared in front of him because of his anger back then.\u2018But it\u2019s too late.\u2019There was two years of time lapse between his previous and current life, and it had been twelve years since he was born. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do, being fourteen years late.\u201cDid you say you would grant me revenge?\u201dIndeed.\u201cWhat is the cost?\u201dPassionate flames ignited in Raon\u2019s eyes.\u201cNothing is free in the world. From what you said earlier\u2026 Are you going to take my body and soul?\u201dIf you crave your revenge, it is only natural to offer your paltry mind and body.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe patiently looked down at Wrath. Something could be seen, confined inside the blue flame. An inhuman existence was giving a wicked smile.\u2018Did this happen because I was reincarnated?\u2019If he had to guess, it must\u2019ve been because he had died in his previous life\u2014before Wrath could take over his body.\u201cRevenge is meaningless if not achieved by me.\u201dHe had been played by Derus his entire life, but finally got a new chance after dying. He couldn\u2019t accept somebody else granting him revenge.\u2018I have to do it myself.\u2019No matter how difficult it was, he was going to cut off Derus\u2019 head by himself. He had no intention of leaving it to others.Excuse me. You\u2019re right.Wrath glared at him with eyes hidden inside the blue flame.You are hiding a deep and dark wrath at the bottom of your heart.He smiled with his teeth.I don\u2019t care what happened. The King of Essence has already decided, so you just have to offer your body.As anger burned up from Wrath\u2019s voice, the blue flame struck him.\u201cKuh!\u201dRaon grabbed his chest, bending at the waist.It was cold.Not only his body, but his mind was also frozen. Wrath\u2019s affinity wasn\u2019t fire, but ice.Think of him and increase your anger. The King of Essence will kill him for you, even if he is a god.His heart was pounding because of Wrath\u2019s creepy voice. It felt as if his heart was pierced by an icicle.Water Resistance (Three-Star) is activating.\u2018Water Resistance!\u2019The water resistance that he had obtained from absorbing the coldness was reducing the pain from Wrath\u2019s icy power.However, Wrath\u2019s attack wasn\u2019t just ice.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dRaon moaned painfully. He remembered Derus\u2019 face, the way he laughed while looking down on him like a bug, making him gasp.Leave your body to the King of Essence. I will break his skull and chew on his flesh.Raon gasped for breath.As Wrath\u2019s voice incited his emotions, Raon wanted to explode with his anger towards Derus.\u2018Absolutely not\u2026\u2019Raon bit back his emotions as hard as he could. If he left his body to Wrath, he could do terrible things to Sylvia and the maids.Even if he were to die there, he couldn\u2019t give him his body.\u2018I have to endure.\u2019He clenched his fist to bleed. He was an assassin, and the best one at that.Patience and emotionlessness were the qualities of an assassin.You are enduring better than I thought, but for how long? No one can win against the icy power of the King of Essence.As if Wrath was mocking him, he released an icy power capable of freezing his mind and body.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dIt was a relief. It was going to be difficult to hold on if he kept inciting his emotions, but he chose to enhance his icy power instead. Raon caught his breath and withstood the icy power penetrating to his bones.A mere human dares!Wrath\u2019s burning voice was irritated and angry.I wanted to avoid harming the body that the King of Essence was going to use, but it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019m going to devour you alive.It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. As his flame grew bigger, the intensity of the icy wave assailing his mind and body increased immensely.\u201cKuh!\u201dUnable to withstand it, Raon groaned. His lip parted as he felt the pain of his flesh being torn apart and organs being severed.Raise your anger and accept the King of Essence. Are you planning to die?\u201cI\u2019d rather die than give my body to someone like you.\u201dHe bit his tongue to come to his senses. The moment he resolved to die rather than giving Wrath his body, he had an idea.\u2018Wait. If \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 can block his icy power\u2026\u2019Then the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 might be able to lower the pain in both his body and mind.Even if it didn\u2019t, he had to give it a try.Raon forcefully calmed his mind and started rotating the rings of fire. The three rings of fire around his heart started to spin violently.<Ring of Fire (Three-Star)> is greatly reducing the damage to your mind and body.It went as expected.The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was a cultivation technique that could develop and protect the mind and body. Therefore, it was also effective at enduring external stimulation.The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 rotated rapidly, bringing vitality to his body and mind. The emotions that were about to explode started to subside.The willpower that he had built up from his previous life, the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, and \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 combined, greatly reducing the pain and stimulus that Wrath was inflicting.Wh-what are you\u2026Wrath\u2019s voice was astonished.Woosh.His barrage of icy power gradually became weaker. It looked like he couldn\u2019t stick to him if he didn\u2019t increase his anger.How did a mere human child?!\u201cI am a human, but I am not a child.\u201dCasting off the subsiding icy power, Raon responded calmly.This doesn\u2019t make any sense. Not at all!Wrath came away from his body while screaming furiously. His lips were shaking like a scared colt.Even though it hasn\u2019t been long since I woke up, for the King of Essence to be pushed back by a mere human!\u201cHaaaah\u2026\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon exhaled and glared at Wrath. His flame wavered like a lamp in the wind.\u201cRevenge is mine to take. I\u2019m not leaving my body to a minor demon.\u201dMinor demon? You dare call a monarch of devildom a minor demon!\u201cYou can\u2019t even deal with me, and yet call yourself a monarch of devildom. I guess all the other monarchs are dead.\u201dYou! Are you for real\u2026?!Wrath amplified his flame once again, but only the size increased. The icy power was a lot weaker than before.\u2018He said he just woke up.\u2019Waking up from a sleep, or a seal\u2026 Either way it looked like he couldn\u2019t use his full force.As Raon shook it off violently, Wrath\u2019s fire was thrown off, fluttering away like a paper.The sound of Wrath grinding his teeth could be heard from the inside of the blue flame.Im-impossible! How are you controlling your emotions?!\u201cThere is no need to tell you. Now disappear.\u201dYou took the power of the King of Essence! How can you ask me to leave?!Wrath glared at him with rage and hate.And the King of Essence has already decided. Before you died, I couldn\u2019t separate from you even if I wanted to. Ah!Raon aimed a punch at the mumbling Wrath. Although the flame dispersed, he couldn\u2019t feel the blow\u2014it was as if he\u2019d punched empty space.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dHe gathered mana on his fingertips. It was lousy compared to aura, but still better than nothing.Swoosh!He slashed with the mana enhanced hand-knife, but Wrath just revived like a candlelight that had managed to withstand the wind.Wh-what are you doing?!\u201cTsk, this won\u2019t work, either.\u201dWrath was like a soul and didn\u2019t have a physical body. Because of that, it didn\u2019t seem like he would disappear even if he used an aura.\u2018Now that I think about it\u2026\u2019Even though Wrath let out his intense power, the swordsmen who were guarding the annex building didn\u2019t barge in.It must\u2019ve been because Raon was the only one who could see or feel him.\u201cHow do I make you disappear?\u2019Give your body to the King of Essence. Then\u2026\u201cYou must be crazy.\u201dAs Raon sneered, a message popped up.Ding!An additional ability has been unlocked.\u201cAn additional ability?\u201dRaon immediately opened the status window.<Status Window>Name: Raon ZieghartTitle: NoneState: Curse of Frost (Eight Strands), Poor Stamina, Decline in Athletic Ability, Decline in Mana AffinityTrait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Three-Star), Water Resistance (Three-Star)The question marks that occupied the first slot of the trait were replaced by Wrath.But that wasn\u2019t the important part. There was new information under the status window.Strength: 13Agility: 13Stamina: 12Energy: 12Perception: 40The abilities, such as strength and agility, were evaluated with numbers.Y-you\u2019ve really got the status window!Cold frost spilled from Wrath\u2019s mouth. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t see the contents of the status window, as he murmured that he could only see the silhouette.\u201cWhat is this status window and the message?\u201d\u2026 It\u2019s a system that the King of Essence created.\u201cSystem? For what?\u201dI have no reason to tell you.\u201cTo accelerate growth?\u201dHow\u2026 How did you\u2026?!\u201cI knew it.\u201dLike a reflex, he responded as soon as he felt him out. Just like his name suggested, Wrath couldn\u2019t hide his feelings.\u2018It\u2019s as I expected.\u2019Raon nodded. He thought it was weird that the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was more efficient than in his previous life, and it was because of the system.Give it back. Your body, my power, give them all back!Wrath started to throw a tantrum. He looked like a baby sitting on a massive throne.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to give them back, nor do I have any intention to do so.\u201dHe obtained the ability to grow faster, to a higher peak. There was no reason to give it back to the madman that tried to take his body.It\u2019s not yours!\u201cAnd you tried to take my body, which is not yours.\u201dTh-the King of Essence heard your wishes\u2026\u201cI did desire revenge, but that is something I must do myself. It\u2019s meaningless if I realize it by giving up my body to something I don\u2019t understand\u2014like you.\u201dKuh\u2026Wrath ground his teeth but couldn\u2019t open his mouth, as he had nothing to say.\u201cGo away, now.\u201dRaon turned away as he finished the conversation.I can\u2019t go. I won\u2019t leave until you give me back my power!Wrath screeched and assaulted Raon. The moment Raon clenched his fist, thinking he would cope with it as much as he wanted, Wrath\u2019s body started to shine blue.The blue flame flowed like water to wind around his wrist. Raon prepared for the incoming pain, but it didn\u2019t hurt at all.Zoom.The blue flame around his wrist disappeared and a bracelet appeared. It was a flowery bracelet made from ice.I\u2019m going to stick with you until the day you die!Wrath provoked him by shaking the flower hanging on the bracelet.It hasn\u2019t been long since I woke up, but my power will soon return. When that happens, you won\u2019t be able to stop me, no matter what you do.\u201cSure.\u201dRaon tried to take off the bracelet, but just like when he tried to touch the flame, it just dispersed instead of being caught.Hmm\u2026But it didn\u2019t look completely ineffective as the bracelet vibrated, and Wrath stopped talking each time he touched it.Kuh, it\u2019s useless. The King of Essence will never be chased away!\u201cLet\u2019s try it, then.\u201dHe tried to scratch, pull, rub it against the wall, and trample on the bracelet. However, Wrath didn\u2019t disappear. He was very tenacious.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe tutted. The flowery bracelet didn\u2019t disappear, no matter what he did.\u2018Even though I do want to remove it\u2026\u2019It might be better to just leave it be.The system could disappear if he forcefully took it off, and there was a chance that the demon would transfer to Sylvia or Helen.Like the saying goes, keep your friends close, and enemies closer. It would be better to keep him nearby, instead of having him plotting somewhere unseen.Counting on the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 to keep growing, he decided to keep Wrath under control.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to get off, then change your appearance at least. A bracelet with flowers doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201dRaon frowned. He could at least understand if it were a skull, but he didn\u2019t want to wear a flowery bracelet.Respect my taste.\u201cHaaah\u2026\u201dHe was at a loss for words at how the taste of this violent and impatient guy was a flowery bracelet.The King of Essence has never let go of his prey. Your body and mind are mine.\u201cI\u2019d better ignore it.\u201dKuh! You damn brat!Raon blocked his hearing and went to bed. Wrath whimpered, but he ignored him.\u2018But if Wrath is the system\u2019s owner, and doesn\u2019t know that I was reincarnated, then who reincarnated me?\u2019Raon murmured the new question and closed his eyes.***Creak.Wrath ground his teeth, looking at the sleeping Raon.\u2018How can a human like this exist?\u2019Even though he wasn\u2019t at full power, he had never thought a human could stop his possession, let alone a ten-year-old child.*\u2018It doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026\u2019Although he was from a different age, he had seen countless humans. Among them was a hero that founded a country with his sword, and a villain that made the whole continent tremble in fear.But it was the first time seeing a human like him. It was as irritating as if he was looking at \u2018that guy\u2019.Just you wait. The day the King of Essence\u2019s power returns, I\u2019m going to devour your soul.Wrath declared, unable to hold in his rage.\u201cThat won\u2019t happen, stop dreaming.\u201dThe young human shook his hand, as if he was driving away flies.The King of Essence never gives up\u2026\u201cI said it won\u2019t.\u201d_____________________T/N: Raon is small for his age, and Wrath doesn\u2019t seem to actually know much about him, or how much time has passed. Otherwise, he\u2019d realize that he hadn\u2019t been a child when he \u2018summoned\u2019 him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sylvia and the maids were lined up in the garden, waiting for him.\u201cSee you later.\u201dSylvia got dewy eyed as Raon waved his hand under their worried gaze.\u2018I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m going alone.\u2019If Sylvia tagged along, he wouldn\u2019t have reached the training ground. It was a relief that only trainees were allowed on the training ground.\u201cLady Sylvia, are you going to part with the young master with that expression?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSylvia\u2019s expression loosened up at Helen\u2019s remark.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia fidgeted as she stood in front of Raon. She was still worried, but she couldn\u2019t tell him to give up anymore.\u2018Because I saw what kind of child he is.\u2019Raon didn\u2019t skip training for a single day over the past month, even as he withstood the coldness coming from his mana circuit.He ran over and over, every day, while breathing out that painfully cold breath. She couldn\u2019t send off a child who strived so earnestly with a sad look.\u201cGood luck, Raon.\u201dSylvia smiled, trying to control her wavering mind and her worries.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon nodded, then turned back. Without delay, he started walking towards the fifth training ground.\u201cIs he going to be alright?\u201d\u201cHe got a lot better. He might even pass the training at this rate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not even wishing for that.\u00a0 I just want him to come back safe and sound.\u201d\u201cThat would be for the best.\u201dSylvia and Helen didn\u2019t stop looking at Raon\u2019s back, which got farther and farther away. They prayed for his safe return, regardless of the result.***The fifth training ground looked like a long box, as tall walls preventing the view from the outside formed a rectangle around the area.To the right side of the entrance there was an outdoor gymnasium, covered in fine soil. And to the left side there was an indoor gymnasium with a roof.Raon looked around the training ground, then looked at the children lined up at the center.\u2018Just like I\u2019ve heard, there are a lot of them.\u2019Despite it being still early, over a hundred children were warming up all around the training ground.He had heard that there were that many people every time because there were children recommended from the outside or vassal families, on top of Zieghart\u2019s direct line and the collaterals.\u2018They said there were more people than usual this time.\u2019Helen had told him that the sixth training ground could also be used that year because of how many people there were.Crunch.He turned around at the snapping sound. A round-faced child with green hair was eating crackers.\u201cDo you want some?\u201dAs Raon stared at him, he took more crackers from his pocket and held them out.\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dHe nodded, then put his hand back to his pocket. This time, he took out a piece of rectangular bread.As Raon was about to warm up, thinking that it was interesting, he heard a cold voice speak.\u201cThat\u2019s him, right? Look at those frail limbs. They look like they\u2019ll break if you touch them. Can he really train?\u201d\u201cA patient should take it easy and give up. I don\u2019t understand why he is being so annoying.\u201d\u201cI closed my eyes when I saw him arguing with the clan leader. It looks like he thinks he is from the direct line. He really doesn\u2019t know his place.\u201dCollateral children were loudly criticizing him. It looked like the rumor had already spread, since many children were glaring at him.\u201cLook at that bracelet?\u201d\u201cA flowery bracelet?\u201d\u201cWhat is he, a baby?\u201dCollaterals giggled, looking at the bracelet on Raon\u2019s wrist. It seemed like the bracelet could be seen by the others.Are they perhaps speaking about the King of Essence?Wrath shuddered, after having been quiet up to that point, as if asleep.\u2018That\u2019s why I told you to change the way the bracelet looks.\u2019They are trash with no taste. What are you doing? Smash their skulls already.Wrath\u2019s voice was boiling with anger.\u2018For what?\u2019They aren\u2019t only mocking the King of Essence, but also picking a fight with you. Are you saying that you are tolerating them?\u2018You don\u2019t even know what happened.\u2019I don\u2019t care! If they looked straight at the King of Essence, that\u2019s enough reason to pluck their eyes out\u2026\u2018I\u2019m not crazy like you.\u2019He was relieved that he didn\u2019t give his body to that madman.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon turned around and looked at the collaterals, who were still running their mouths. Although they flinched a little, they provocatively stuck their chins out.\u2018I would\u2019ve ignored it in my previous life.\u2019Since an assassin shouldn\u2019t draw any attention, he would\u2019ve turned away, pretending that he hadn\u2019t heard anything.However, he had decided to live his current life as Raon Zieghart, not as an assassin. There was no reason to ignore them.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dRaon menacingly approached the children. They looked flustered, as they hadn\u2019t expected him to come up to them.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWh-what are you saying\u2026?\u201d\u201cStop buzzing like a mosquito and speak clearly.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cTh-that is\u2026\u201dThe children from the collateral line didn\u2019t know what to do, so they awkwardly looked at each other.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Those children were just repeating what their parents said. It was the kind of situation that didn\u2019t even need a proper solution.\u201cHaven\u2019t you learned not to talk about people behind their back if you cannot speak to their faces?\u201d\u201cSh-shut up!\u201d\u201cHow dare you, when you were ruined and forced to live in the annex building!\u201d\u201cYou are collateral, not of the direct line!\u201d\u201cYou are also collateral. The word \u2018dare\u2019 is used when you are talking to someone in a lower position than you. You don\u2019t have the right to say that to me.\u201dRaon\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t loud, nor quiet, as he was simply stating the facts.\u201cKuh!\u201dThe three collaterals spread their feet and clenched their fists, as if they were going to strike at any time.Snap.Raon stretched his fingers. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea to warm up and attract some attention before the training started.\u201cScrew you\u2026\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dWhen the collaterals were about to charge, a stern scolding was heard. It was from a handsome, blue-haired boy in his early teens.Who does he think he is to get in the way? Break his skull.\u2018Is that Burren?\u2019He was of the direct line, the one who had the best talent at the Judgment Ceremony.\u201cWhat are you all doing when the training is about to start? Are you planning to blacken the name of Zieghart in front of outsiders?\u201dHe\u2019d expected he would take the three brats\u2019 side, but he scolded everyone instead.\u201cBu-Burren!\u201d\u201cI apologize!\u201dA single word from Burren was enough to make the collaterals bow like mice in front of a cat, despite how they were about to charge at Raon.\u201cAnd you still don\u2019t know your place.\u201dAfter getting the apology from the collaterals, Burren approached Raon.\u201cYou are like dust that can be removed at any time. If you don\u2019t want to be cast out of the annex building as well, then stay as quiet as a mouse.\u201dBurren frowned with obvious contempt.\u2018Good for nothing!\u2019The foolish guy in front of him had taken the undivided attention of the head of house a month before, using the circumstances instead of his own abilities.Incompetence was what he hated the most, and arrogance that doesn\u2019t know its place was second to that.And Raon Zieghart had them both.He was a loser that was going to drop out from the training, and the fact that he had drawn the head of house\u2019s attention made him irritated.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t planning to participate in the training, then get out of here. No, just get out of my sight, since there is no way you will manage to pass the training.\u201dAs Burren admonished him, the collaterals sneered. When they were about to return with satisfied expressions, Raon took a step ahead.\u201cThat\u2019s such a boorish way of talking rubbish.\u201dRaon inclined his chin. With a tilted gaze, he looked straight at Burren.\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou are of the direct line, but you don\u2019t have any rank. You\u2019re going to cast me out of the annex building? Do you think you can do that when you aren\u2019t even a trainee yet? Oh, I guess you might have a chance if you cry to your father.\u201d\u201cHow dare you, collateral\u2026\u201dGreen wind covered Burren\u2019s fist. When he approached Raon with bloodthirsty eyes, the door to the training ground cracked open.Slam!* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A red-haired man walked past the door, which was still vibrating. With pointy ears and heavenly appearance, he had both a mysterious and cheerful atmosphere around him.\u201cAre you fighting already? You have a lot of guts, I guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re still young. Too young, actually.\u201dHe grinned and moved to the center of the training ground.\u2018That guy works here?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t know him, since he was Zieghart\u2019s Sword of Light, the elf swordsman Rimmer, who was extremely famous.\u2018I heard he had retired\u2026\u2019There was news that he was injured in a dungeon and ended up retiring, so he hadn\u2019t expected to meet him there.\u201cHmph!\u201dRimmer glanced at Raon and Burren, then went to the platform that allowed him to look down on the whole training ground.\u201cAhem\u2026\u201dBurren bit his lips and turned around. His expression seemed to imply that he would forgive Raon this time, but that he should be careful next time.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dRimmer smiled from the platform.\u201cI\u2019m the head instructor Rimmer, who is going to oversee your training.\u201dHis voice was bright, not in a frivolous way, but cheerful. Keeping a laid-back smile, he continued.\u201cThere are a hundred sixty trainees, but only eight instructors. As you must also be thinking that there are too many trainees, let\u2019s reduce that number. A quarter would be ideal.\u201dRimmer\u2019s laid-back smile became slightly mischievous.\u201cRe-reduce?\u201d\u201cTo a quarter?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026?\u201dThe children\u2019s faces went ashy pale. It was the first time they\u2019d heard of trainees being weeded out before basic training.\u201cWe will distinguish between gems and pebbles, quite literally. I\u2019d rather train some quality swordsmen over quantity. \u201cRimmer waved his finger at the children, as if he were choosing products.\u201cEh? I came here because I was told to\u2026\u201dThe green haired child who held out a cracker earlier dropped the bread he was holding.\u201cI\u2019m a Zieghart collateral! It\u2019s nonsense to weed me out before becoming a trainee!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true! We were all ordered to participate by the family!\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019m dumb, so I don\u2019t know about the direct line or collateral lines.\u201dRimmer frowned while picking his ear with his pinky finger.\u201cI\u2019m the law on this training ground. If you aren\u2019t happy about it, complain to the lord who made me the law.\u201dDespite looking like a ruffian rather than a head instructor, his good-looking appearance still managed to make him look cool.\u2018Weeding out\u2026\u2019Raon scratched his chin. He heard that Rimmer was extremely talented at feeling his opponent\u2019s spirit and potential. It seemed that he was going to use that to make a selection.Who is that arrogant guy?\u2018What?\u2019He dares to look down on me! I don\u2019t like it. Pluck off that elf\u2019s ears.\u2018Is there even anyone that you do like?\u2019As his name suggested, Wrath was angry at everything. It didn\u2019t seem like he liked anything at all.Back in the devildom, nobody could see my eyes. As the true monarch that every demon admired\u2026 Y-you!\u2018Shut up.\u2019Because Wrath started to talk for too long, he tapped the bracelet.\u201cThen let\u2019s start the test.\u201dRimmer blew away the earwax on his pinky finger.\u201cWhat do you think the most important thing is when learning martial arts?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s talent!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a strong and flexible body!\u201d\u201cA steady energy center!\u201d\u201cThe way of training for swordsmanship and aura is the most important!\u201dThe children seemed to think that the test had already started, as they shouted what they thought was the most important with their hands raised.\u201cTalent, body, energy center, swordsmanship, those are all correct. However, those are just the walls and roof. There is a groundwork that needs to be laid under them. It\u2019s stamina and willpower.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dThe children lowered their hands and nodded, believing that he was right.\u201cSome of you have already learned martial arts, and others haven\u2019t. As such, I\u2019m going to use the simplest, yet the most certain, method to evaluate you.\u201dRimmer\u2019s finger, which had been pointed at the children, moved to towards the outdoor gymnasium.\u201cRun laps in the gymnasium until I tell you to stop. At full speed!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, two people moved. It was Burren\u2014from the direct line\u2014who was at the Judgment Ceremony with Raon, and Runaan, from the vassal family Sullion.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cLet\u2026 Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dThe other children followed the two and started running in the gymnasium.Don\u2019t move. Nobody is allowed to order the King of Essence\u2026Raon ignored Wrath and filled his lungs with fresh air. He kicked the ground, following the children running in front of him.\u2018They are indeed different.\u2019Runaan and Burren were running way ahead already. Despite looking like they were casually running, they were at a speed that nobody else could catch up to.It wasn\u2019t because of their aura being high quality or having a special attribute, but simply because they had trained their minds and bodies from an early age.Ahem. If you have started running, then go to the front. Why are you at the very back?\u2018I don\u2019t even know what you want anymore.\u2019I just don\u2019t want to lose.\u2018This is not a competition.\u2019Raon looked at Rimmer, who was whistling on the platform. He probed others\u2019 potential and spirit. What was visible to the eyes wasn\u2019t going to be the only criteria.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled with shining eyes.\u2018The winner of this test is whoever lasts the longest.\u2019And that was something that he was confident about, more than anyone in the continent.***\u201cLord Burren and Lady Runaan are clearly peerless.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just their speed, but they are also stable. They aren\u2019t at their full speed, so they should be able to run for hours like that. To be so accomplished at that age, I\u2019m afraid of what they will become. It\u2019s scary.\u201dThe two instructors standing under the platform were chatting while looking at the running children.\u201cThe collaterals this year are also quite capable. They must\u2019ve been well educated.\u201d\u201cSame goes for the recommended trainees. There are many competent ones. It looks like they have been picked carefully.\u201dThey didn\u2019t only look at Burren and Runaan. They evaluated every single child, including those running at the back.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe instructors that were observing every child frowned as they looked at Raon, running among the group in the back.\u201cAs expected, he can\u2019t catch up.\u201d\u201cHe\u00a0is\u00a0a patient. That much is already amazing.\u201d\u201cHm, he looks tired already. He is going to drop out soon.\u201dThe instructors calmly looked away to other children, as they had already expected.However, Rimmer, who was humming behind them, had his eyes fixated on Raon.\u2018How curious.\u2019Rimmer\u2019s green eyes shone brightly.\u2018It\u2019s my first time seeing someone like him.\u2019He had received a blessing of nature brighter than any other race, and he was excellent at discerning others\u2019 condition and potential.He thought the only people he couldn\u2019t analyze with his talent were the continent\u2019s strongest.\u2018However\u2026\u2019He had to change his mind for the first time.Neither Runaan and Burren, who were running at the front, nor the collateral and recommended trainees who were running behind them, could go beyond his insight.He could see how they would grow, and how much stronger they would become.Except for one person. Raon Zieghart.\u2018Why can\u2019t I see it?\u2019As if hidden behind a cloud, he couldn\u2019t see his future, nor his potential.Because he had no potential? It wasn\u2019t something like that. It meant that he was outside of his perception, like when he was looking at those stronger than himself.\u201cThis is funny.\u201dRimmer smiled. A really interesting human had appeared in such a boring era.***\u201cLook at that.\u201d\u201cIs he really in last place after acting all cocky?\u2019\u201cYou can\u2019t even call him last place, since he will drop out soon.\u201dThe collaterals smirked, looking at Raon running among the slowest group.\u201cThere\u2019s no way a guy who grew up comfortably in an annex building can run properly.\u201d\u201cLook at his face, he\u2019s so flustered.\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t even going to last ten minutes.\u201dChildren other than the three collaterals also started laughing.But Raon didn\u2019t have a serious expression because of being worn out.\u2018Are they really only going to run when it\u2019s training?\u2019In his previous life, hungry beasts were released behind them when they were training their stamina.Just running until their stamina ran out was too easy to be true in comparison.It was too easy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne hour had passed since the children started running around the gymnasium.Burren and Runaan were still running at the front, and the collaterals, vassal children, and recommended children were neck-in-neck behind them.Of course, not all one hundred sixty of them were running anymore.Those who lacked stamina had already given up and were resting in a corner, and the number of quitters kept increasing even now.\u201cHaaaah.\u201dRimmer\u2019s eyes quickly moved left and right, despite lying down on the platform and yawning.\u2018The sixty-first guy gave up earlier than his stamina could last, and the sixty-second one lasted longer.\u2019He was grasping all one hundred sixty children at a glance with sleepy eyes.However, stamina wasn\u2019t the only thing Rimmer was analyzing.\u2018There is no point in just checking their stamina.\u2019How much stamina children had depended on how they grew up. Honestly, they were all similar except for the two direct lines and the roughly twenty best children.Even if their stamina was similar, some children gave up as soon as they were out of breath, and some kept running until the end, while their sides pinched or they cried.\u2018That difference is the most important thing here.\u2019Just like there were people who gave up easily, there are also people who never gave up. That difference in willpower that looked small at present would grow to be tremendous in the future.Stamina could be increased, and talents could be nurtured.However, it was extremely difficult to develop perseverance.Children who never gave up wouldn\u2019t give up in the future either, and children who gave up easily would grow up to be adults who did the same.Of course, there were exceptions, as some would realize and change their way. However, that was as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.Looking for a child who already had the perseverance and the willpower was the easiest way.\u2018This is pretty much set in stone now.\u2019Rimmer smiled. Over half of the children had already given up, and the rest were getting slower as they tired.As Rimmer was preparing to end the exam, the golden-haired child running in the back group crossed his sight.\u2018Raon Zieghart.\u2019He was the only child who had exceeded his expectations. Rimmer\u2019s eyes shone like stars.\u2018I don\u2019t understand it.\u2019Raon had run out of stamina a long time ago. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to stand, because of the coldness pressing upon his body and shortening his breath. However, he kept moving his feet relentlessly, without breaking his posture.\u2018This can\u2019t even be called perseverance anymore. This is obstinacy.\u2019He had seen many brilliant talents, throughout countless battlefields.Among them, there were swordsmen who would stand at the top of the continent with their swords, and magicians who would change the standard of the world with their magic. But none of them had as much persistence as Raon.He kept running even after running out of stamina, especially when he was a twelve-year-old child who was born with a terrible constitution.That wasn\u2019t possible without having gone through dozens of life-or-death battles. He couldn\u2019t figure out just how a sheltered child possibly ended up with such obstinacy.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019He looked around the entire gymnasium.Runaan and Burren, who were staying at the top despite saving their power, were amazing. However, that was nothing compared to Raon, who was still running with no stamina.The collaterals and the children of vassal families who made fun of Raon were drooling as they ran, as if they didn\u2019t want to lose to him.\u201cHaha.\u201dRimmer\u2019s lips bent into a smooth arc.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun teaching them.\u201d***\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren Zieghart kept turning back, as he couldn\u2019t focus on running. And each time, he had to frown.\u2018Why? Why is that guy still running?!\u2019Raon Zieghart. He was an insolent child who talked back to the head of house, and he was unexpectedly still going. He was slow, but he kept running at a constant speed until the end.\u2018He shouldn\u2019t be in a condition to run right now\u2026\u2019He already knew Raon\u2019s condition. He was born with coldness, which not only made him incapable of moving his body properly, but also slowed down his growth.And when he saw him for the first time, he looked even more pathetic. He was short, and he didn\u2019t have the slightest sign of having trained.\u2018And yet\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t give up.The collaterals, children of vassal families, and the recommended children whose talents had been acknowledged were already giving up. And yet, he was still running despite, panting like he was going to die.\u2018And the person next to me, they\u2019re also annoying.\u2019Runaan, who was the only person who kept up with him, and Raon, who should\u2019ve dropped out already, were both irritating.\u2018Alright. I\u2019ll show you the clear difference.\u2019Deciding that he would discourage both Runaan and Raon, he fiercely kicked the ground.Swoosh!Using aura, he amplified the muscles in his thighs and calves. Running at a speed that could create tunnel vision, he looked back.\u2018Those brats?!\u2019Neither Runaan, who he thought of as a rival, nor Raon were showing any kind of reaction.They were both running at their own pace, and it was the collaterals and the children from vassal families who were carelessly following him.\u201cTsk!\u201dBurren clicked his tongue and increased his speed. He was now far ahead of Runaan, who used to run next to him, and he had already run past Raon a long time ago.However, Runaan and Raon\u2019s speed didn\u2019t change. It was like they were telling him that they weren\u2019t interested in him.\u2018Kuh!\u2019Realizing that he was ignored by those inferior to him, anger simmered inside him.\u2018Let\u2019s see until when you can keep up that act.\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHuff!\u201dRaon smiled, exhaling vigorously.\u2018Power keeps flowing in.\u2019His stamina pool had gone empty, resembling a dried-up well a long time ago.His head was spinning so hard that he felt like he would faint, but he managed to withstand it thanks to the vitality the three starred \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 provided him.\u2018This is heaven compared to back then.\u2019In his previous life, wild dogs chased him when he was younger. He\u2019d run down the mountain while grabbing a heart that felt like it would explode.There were also times when the wild dog had caught him in the end, resulting in a fight to the death. Compared to that hellish life, what he was doing right now was child\u2019s play.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon looked forward while panting. The collaterals and the recommended children, who were still running at full speed, were certainly exceptionally talented. However, Runaan and Burren were different from them; they were steadily running from the beginning, at a constant speed.Just as he thought that they weren\u2019t called geniuses for nothing, Burren suddenly sped up. He ran past Runaan and became the front runner.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cLo\u2026 Lord Burren?\u201d\u201cRun! Don\u2019t fall behind!\u201dThe collaterals and recommended children who saw him forcibly increased their speed.\u201cHmph!\u201dAs if telling them to catch up, Burren peered at Runaan and Raon.What are you doing right now? Are you going to do nothing when you are provoked? Catch up to him and crush those eyes.Wrath ground his teeth, glaring at Burren, but Raon didn\u2019t react.\u2018I told you before. This isn\u2019t a competition.\u2019The run was a test to show how much stamina and willpower everyone had, not a competition. And there was one more person who knew that fact.\u2018Runaan Sullion.\u2019The silver-haired girl running in second place kept her pace, as if she didn\u2019t have a speck of interest in Burren.\u2018She is actually one step ahead of him.\u2019He\u2019d thought that they were similar, but it looked like Runaan was mentally superior to Burren.Burren was pretending to be an adult, but he was acting according to his age. If he went onto the battlefield as he was, he would\u2019ve died quickly.\u2018That\u2019s not something I should care about.\u2019Raon kept running in the gymnasium, following Runaan\u2019s back instead of Burren\u2019s.\u201cRa\u2026 Raon?\u201d\u201cHow\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 he was still running?\u201dThe collaterals who exhausted themself running after Burren fell behind. They were the ones who were mocking him before the exam had started.\u201cHuff, huff! Wh\u2026 what did you do?\u201d\u201cKuh, there\u2019s no way\u2026\u201dAs Raon ran past them, the collaterals that were panting slowed their steps and sat down on the ground.Raon kept running, using their astonished gaze as a driving force.\u2018Pathetic.\u2019It\u2019s a fact that those who couldn\u2019t stop talking no matter where they went were actually worthless. Since he wasn\u2019t interested in them to begin with, he forgot about them and kept running.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon kept rotating his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 through slow breaths.\u2018The ring is developing rapidly.\u2019Even though he hadn\u2019t run for a long time, the cultivation of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was progressing quickly. After all, the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was a cultivation technique that showed its true value upon going all out.\u2018It\u2019s still incredibly difficult, though.\u2019The rotating ring of fires didn\u2019t make the pain disappear. He felt like his heart and lungs were being crushed, and his side hurt as if it was stabbed by a dagger.How pathetic.Wrath clicked his tongue as he kept running full out.I can\u2019t accept defeat from you whose body will become mine. Give your body to me right now. I will catch up and completely freeze that blue haired brat right now.\u2018Shut up.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a test to catch up. It was a fight against himself.I can\u2019t accept defeat as long as The King of Essence has his eyes open.\u2018Then close your eyes. It\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m still running like this.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a lie.Even though he had Wrath\u2019s system, he still couldn\u2019t get rid of the coldness inside his mana circuits. The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was a miracle that allowed him to keep running.Then give your body to me.Wrath transformed into the blue flame that he had seen the day before. His anger made him nauseated as it stimulated his emotions.\u2018Not now, of all times\u2026\u2019Raon bit his lip. Wrath\u2019s stimulation felt twice as painful than the day before because of how tired he was.\u2018It\u2019s pointless, so go back to sleep already.\u2019He kept his calm expression using his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 at full force. He kept moving his legs, pretending he wasn\u2019t affected.Kuh! Why does The King of Essence\u2019s power not work on you?!Wrath kept stimulating the angry emotion relentlessly.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon withstood Wrath\u2019s mental attack with his already empty stamina.\u2018I\u2019m dying\u2026\u2019Cold sweat ran down his back. He felt like he would faint at any moment.Thanks to the balance between the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and the experience of his previous life\u2014one of countless life or death situations\u2014he barely managed to hold on.You stubborn brat!\u2018Give up and piss off!\u2019\u201cHaa!\u201dWhile Raon was pushing back Wrath\u2019s power, Rimmer, who was lying on the platform suddenly stood up.\u201cEveryone, stop!\u201dThe children who were running in the gymnasium stopped as they heard his clear voice.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201d\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cAww!\u201dThe children could hardly keep their eyes open as they panted, sitting on the ground or holding their knees.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon looked like he would die as he panted heavily.What a monster.Wrath grinded his teeth and went back to the bracelet.\u2018I told you, you can\u2019t.\u2019He wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. The test was difficult, but withstanding Wrath\u2019s attack was even more so. If he\u2019d kept running, he could\u2019ve really died.\u2018This life isn\u2019t normal either\u2026 Hmm?\u2019A new message popped up while he was drinking.Ding!An extreme stamina-surpassing action was performed.Ability points have increased.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayStrength, Agility, and Stamina have increased by 2.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dRaon gasped.\u2018That\u2019s actually true.\u2019His muscles twitched, starting from his forearm then down his entire body. When he clenched his fist, he could feel that his grasping power had become a bit stronger than before.Tap.His body was light, as if he got rid of a small lump of metal from his body, as he tried jumping in place.\u2018So the actual body changes when the stats increase, huh?\u2019Did you think the system made by the King of Essence was fake?\u2018This is crazy.\u2019Raon was speechless. It didn\u2019t make any sense that his physical abilities would improve as a reward for training past his limits. He was about to say that the system was too overpowered, when the second set of messages appeared.Successfully withstood <Wrath>\u2019s interruption.Ability points have increased further.Agility, Stamina, and Energy have increased by 1.They were messages announcing an additional increase in abilities from withstanding Wrath\u2019s disruption.What is that?\u2018\u2026\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes shone as he stayed silent, feeling the euphoria rush through his body.Wh-what is this? How come it gives you extra stats for withstanding my disruption?!\u2018Did you not know about it either?\u2019Of course! The system has never been stolen from me before, and the King of Essence had never failed to take over a human\u2019s body!Wrath transformed into a blue flame and flew around in front of his eyes. He looked flustered as he acted like a bee.\u2018I guess so.\u2019When Raon nodded, a thumping sound could be heard from above the platform.\u201cGood job, everyone.\u201dRimmer, who had stomped the ground, was smiling as he clapped his hands.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dTo his cheerful smile, the children who gave up frowned and lowered their heads.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d\u201cI barely made it.\u201d\u201cI thought I would die.\u201dOn the other hand, those who managed to hold on until the end smiled in satisfaction, despite their tired expressions.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t fail you out yet.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dChildren opened their eyes at Rimmer\u2019s lighthearted voice.\u201cI said you were going to be tested, but I didn\u2019t say that the decision would be made today.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes. However, if you keep training like today, then most of you will fail out.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cWh-what does that mean\u2026?\u201dThe children stared at Rimmer in disbelief. Since there were over fifty people who managed to run until the end, it was difficult to believe that most of them were going to fail.\u201cI clearly mentioned that you should run at full speed, but you saved your strength while running. Among the one hundred sixty of you, there was only one person who ran at full speed the entire time.\u201dRimmer looked at Raon for a very short moment.\u201cExcept for him, everyone else preserved their strength as they ran. It\u2019s pathetic that some of you ended up giving up despite that.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that is\u2026\u201dAs the children were exposed, they couldn\u2019t find their embarrassment and their faces turned red.\u201cIn addition, the sly ones that used their aura in order to not fall behind should reflect on their actions.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAs Rimmer finished his sentence, several trainees, including Burren, bit their lips.\u201cWell, I actually don\u2019t really care about what you do. The ones who take the test are you, not me.\u201dRimmer grinned. It was a mysterious smile that was serious and crafty at the same time.\u201cYour status will be \u2018Temporary Trainee\u2019 from now on. I will remove the \u2018temporary\u2019 from it if you manage to pass the test that will take place in six months.\u201d\u201cWh-what is that test?\u201dThe green-eyed child who wanted to give Raon a cracker earlier raised his hand with blurry eyes.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fun if I told you about it. There won\u2019t be a ranking, but there will be a first place, so do your best.\u201d\u201cHow hard do we have to train?\u201d\u201cI will give you a simple but straightforward hint.\u201dCracking his neck, he looked down at the children. Everyone\u2019s eyes were shining with expectations.\u201cFor six months, complete all the training that I give you. If you just follow my instructions, without involving your personal opinions, then you will pass your test for sure.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 Is that true?\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound too simple?\u201dThe children\u2019s expressions brightened, as if they were facing the sun, when they heard that following instructions was enough.\u201cI don\u2019t lie. If you follow my instructions, you will pass. However\u2026\u201dThe corners of Rimmer\u2019s lips lifted.\u201cThat won\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m just going to give you the instructions and let you train however you want. If you follow them the way you did today, then everyone will fail without exception.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201dThe expressions on the faces of the twelve- to thirteen-year-old children were filled with urgency, as they couldn\u2019t go back home without any results.However, there were people who stayed calm, as if they weren\u2019t concerned. They were Raon and Runaan.They didn\u2019t show any reaction, despite hearing what Rimmer said.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dOn the other hand, Burren, who had finished first, didn\u2019t look good.He didn\u2019t say any names, but Rimmer reproached him and complimented Raon. Despite running faster than anyone, he felt like he had lost to that trash collateral.\u2018What insolence!\u2019Burren kept glaring at the back of Raon\u2019s head instead of listening to Rimmer\u2019s explanation on the test.\u201cYou will live in the fifth training ground\u2019s dormitory from now on. It has the best facilities and treatments, so enjoy yourselves for six months.\u201dRimmer pointed at the dormitory, which could be seen behind the training ground.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the dormitory\u2026?\u201dThe children\u2019s expressions didn\u2019t get better, despite hearing that it had the best treatment. That was because they knew those benefits were only temporary.\u201cSince this is the first day, I\u2019ll finish here. You can go rest or keep training here however you want. There is also an indoor gymnasium on the left side, so feel free to use it.\u201dRimmer went down the platform as he finished his speech. However, when he was halfway down the stairs, he turned his head and grinned.\u201cOh, one more thing. Social standing doesn\u2019t exist here. Whether you are a king, a commoner, or a slave, you are all equals. Make sure to get along with your fellow trainees.\u201dHe waved his hand, showing he really had nothing else to say now, and left the training ground. Half the instructors followed him and left, while the other half looked over the children with their backs against the wall.That rude, pointy-eared\u2026\u2018What do you dislike about him so much?\u2019Raon showed his confusion as he looked down on Wrath.I don\u2019t like his face. He dares to look down on the King of Essence, thinking he has everything in his grasp. Ten thousand years of imprisonment in ice won\u2019t be enough punishment for such insolence.\u2018\u2026\u2019He explained, but Raon still couldn\u2019t understand it. It looked like Wrath was just a psychopath.\u2018I\u2019d better ignore him.\u2019Shaking his head slightly, he relaxed his tired body and mind using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018I should check out the gymnasium.\u2019Ignoring the murmuring Wrath, Raon entered the indoor gymnasium that Rimmer mentioned.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cJust how did you even run?\u201dThe collaterals and children of vassal families couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Raon\u2019s back as he entered the indoor gymnasium.There was too big of a difference between what they saw earlier, and what they had heard of him before.They still couldn\u2019t believe that he managed to hold out for longer than they had, despite them constantly training their stamina.\u201cIt must be thanks to the elixir.\u201dKrein Zieghart frowned. He was the collateral who first picked a fight with Raon.\u201cE-elixir?\u201d\u201cBut those living in the annex building were abandoned by the direct line.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And he is the worst among the collaterals. How could he have gotten an elixir?\u201d\u201cEven if he got an elixir, it shouldn\u2019t have been a good one.\u201d\u201cI heard that the Ragged Saint gave it to him, not the family.\u201dKrein explained the situations to the collaterals, who were all wondering.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cThe Saint did!\u201d\u201cIn the end, he managed to run thanks to the power of the elixir, not on his own.\u201d\u201cAnd he\u2019s so proud!\u201dHearing that he\u2019d taken an elixir given to him by the Ragged Saint, the children looked disgusted.\u201cTsk!\u201d\u201cWhat a lucky guy!\u201d\u201cHe got a lucky elixir despite being a mere collateral, there is really nothing likable about him.\u201dKrein smiled, as the collateral children expressed their resentment.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying,\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we teach him a small lesson?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Apparently, he talked back to Lord Burren as well.\u201d\u201cI guess we need to show him what\u2019s up.\u201d\u201cThen when he goes back to the dormitory today\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it.\u201dWhen the collaterals were about to plan their assault, a low voice was heard from beside them.\u201cL-Lord Burren?\u201d\u201cYou will dirty the name of Zieghart.\u201dBurren gave a cold glance at the collaterals.\u2018How pathetic.\u2019He didn\u2019t like Raon Zieghart either, but oppressing him using group violence was disgraceful.He couldn\u2019t let them plan such a thing as someone who\u2019d received the name of Zieghart.\u201cHe is a mere insect that will drop out soon enough. Just ignore him and focus on your training.\u201dNarrowing his eyes at their unsightly behavior, he left the training ground.\u201cAh, hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 He told us to stop.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cAre you really that stupid?\u201dKrein clicked his tongue, seeing the discouraged collateral children.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe is actually telling us to do it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe was saying that he didn\u2019t want to get his own hands dirty, so we should proceed with it. Did you really not get it?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 Is that so?\u201d\u201cOf course. Finish preparing already. If we give Raon a proper lesson, Lord Burren will also be satisfied.\u201dThe four trainees gathered in a circle and started to plan how they would discipline Raon.And after that\u2026Runaan Sullion, who hadn\u2019t looked at anyone so far, focused her gaze on a certain location.It wasn\u2019t Burren who finished first place, nor the collateral or the children from vassal families, nor Rimmer, who was called the Sword of Light of Zieghart.Raon Zieghart.Her gaze was fixated on Raon\u2019s back, whose performance had been less than average during the test. And then, she murmured one word.\u201cWeird.\u201d***Rimmer left the training ground and climbed up the North Grave Mountain, located behind the main building. Reaching the tiger-shaped rock at the mountainside, he lifted his head.\u201cThere is a guest at my napping site.\u201dWhen he spoke to the rock, the golden-haired old man standing on top of it inclined his head. It was Glenn Zieghart.\u201cHow did it go?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no point in asking me that question.\u201dRimmer smiled bitterly while leaning his back against the rock.\u201cAs you already know, I have a good eye for people. And yet\u2026 I couldn\u2019t see through Raon. I couldn\u2019t analyze his condition at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it was completely empty. It was as dry as a dry mop that had been squeezed out countless times. I don\u2019t understand at all how he could run until the end.\u201dCuriosity and astonishment dwelled inside Rimmer\u2019s smiling eyes.\u201cBurren and Runaan have the best talent, and the other children aren\u2019t bad, either. They can certainly become the pillars that will support the family in the future. However\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were unable to judge Raon.\u201dGlenn gaze went past Rimmer, towards the fifth training ground.\u201cYou are correct. His talents, potential, future, and tendencies\u2014none of them could be seen. It\u2019s my first time being in the dark like this since I met you, my lord.\u201dRimmer giggled.\u201cIt has been boring ever since my energy center became ragged, but this looks fun for once.\u201d\u201cYour job isn\u2019t to look for fun. It\u2019s to raise the children into warriors befitting the name of Zieghart.\u201d\u201cOf course. I know that. Am I not Zieghart\u2019s the most loyal subject?\u201dRimmer nodded like a hoodlum.\u201cIf you weren\u2019t a patient and a comrade in war, your head would be flying right now.\u201d\u201cWow, I guess having wounded my energy center was helpful for once!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGlenn looked at Rimmer\u2019s energy center and around his heart, then turned his head away.\u201cYou asked for the position of head instructor, so focus on your job instead of getting distracted.\u201d\u201cOf course. I feel like one of the trainees this year will become someone worthy of entrusting my future.\u201dRimmer turned his gaze towards the training ground, where Glenn was looking.\u201cDo you mean Burren or Runaan?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility, but it could be one of the recommended children, or an obstinate commoner, or a child that has been abandoned by the family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a coincidence. That child can hardly become a warrior.\u201dGlenn walked down the North Grave Mountain after saying that. Rimmer stared at the back of his most esteemed warrior, and grinned.\u201cYou already know it isn\u2019t.\u201d***Raon walked outside of the indoor gymnasium after checking the different equipment.\u2018Not bad.\u2019The training equipment was the latest and the best, just like Rimmer had said. The training ground certainly looked like it would raise the trainees to be the best if they could follow directions.Since he had started to train in the afternoon, the sky was already getting dark. He went out of the training ground, and was about to head over to the dormitory\u2026\u201cHey.\u201dFrom the alleyway to the right side, a low voice could be heard. When he turned his head, the four collaterals who picked a fight that morning were glaring at him with intimidating expressions.\u201cI heard you ingested an elixir before your first birthday.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you became so cocky?\u201d\u201cIf I consumed an elixir like you, I would\u2019ve been way better than you. I\u2019d be right behind Lord Burren already.\u201dThe four children seemed to believe that they were speaking with authority as they approached.Are you really being looked down on by children? I want to end my life now.\u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019The flame in Raon\u2019s eyes was ignited.\u2018You will be able to see what you want this time.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We just want to talk.\u201dThe long-haired collateral at the front approached him. Raon knew his name already. Krein Zieghart. He was the guy who picked a fight with him that morning, and he had also shown a rather brilliant talent during the Judgment Ceremony.\u201cHey.\u201dThe three children who were next to Krein stuck themselves to Raon\u2019s sides and his back, when Krein pointed with his chin.\u201cTalk? What kind of talk do you want?\u201dHe wanted to step back, but it was impossible to retreat with three people blocking his way.\u201cYou\u2019ll know once we get there.\u201d\u201cFollow quietly.\u201dKrein gestured with a grin, and the two guys next to him started to push him with their shoulders.Since Raon was small for his age, while the collaterals were rather big, it looked like adults taking away a kid.\u201cWa-wait a second. How about we talk here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been so arrogant.\u201dAs Raon shrugged and lowered his gaze, the collateral children giggled and put their arms under his armpit.You told me you would show me what I wanted to see, but what are you doing now?\u2018Simmering the rice takes time. This is the same, so wait a little.\u2019\u201cKuh!\u201dRaon was thrown to the wall after being dragged helplessly to the training ground\u2019s vicinity. It was a dark and secluded place, with no one in sight.\u201cWh-why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cYou elixir-boosted punk.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou got abandoned by the direct line, but you dare to boast with the power of a lucky elixir?\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even have been able to run today if it wasn\u2019t for the elixir you got from the Saint.\u201d\u201cYou wimp!\u201dThe collaterals\u2019 expressions became fierce, like savage beasts who presented with their prey.\u2018For that ridiculous reason\u2026\u2019The childish and shabby reason seemed to prove that they were still kids.\u2018And they don\u2019t seem to think that they might lose, not at all.\u2019Raon sneered.\u2018I guess that\u2019s normal.\u2019Unlike him, who was twelve years old, the collaterals were thirteen years old, and their bodies were also a lot bigger. Since they had been training for a long time, they didn\u2019t even consider the possibility of losing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will make it unnoticeable.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve done this, after all.\u201d\u201cJust like what the instructor said, we are going to just have a chat between fellow trainees.\u201dThe collaterals approached while swinging their fists.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dRaon raised his head and smiled.\u201cDamn right.\u201dThe fear and confusion in his eyes could no longer be seen.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dThe one with the bowl cut at the right side of him punched him.After twisting his shoulder to dodge the fist, Raon used his right elbow to strike his chest.\u201cGack!\u201dThe bowl head quacked with his head on the ground, unable to breathe. He kept scratching the ground, trying to respire.\u201cWh-what happened!\u201dThe narrow-eyed one to his left kicked at him.Whack!Raon fended off against it using his left hand. Then he approached him and struck his solar plexus using his fist.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dThe narrow-eyed child tumbled on the ground, grabbing his stomach as his eyes turned white.Wham!The guy from behind slammed down with his two fists clenched together. Raon deflected it with his palm and kicked his abdomen.\u201cHuff!\u201dThe biggest guy gasped, collapsing on the ground.\u201cWh-what are you all doing? Why are you losing to that bastard?!\u201dKrein, who was the last one standing, stepped back. His hands were shaking as he stuttered.\u201cWe are having a talk between fellow trainees, just as you said.\u2019Raon approached Krein, matching his steps to his retreat.\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u2019Krein swung his left fist as he shouted, followed by his right fist. It was a well-trained, consecutive attack.However, the one on the receiving end wasn\u2019t a normal twelve-year-old child.Crack!Raon\u2019s hand twisted up like a poisonous snake. He grabbed Krein\u2019s left arm and twisted it to the right.\u201cKuah!\u201dKrein shrieked, unable to finish swing his right fist due to the arm-breaking pain.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201dUsing his left hand like a blade, he chopped across Krein\u2019s right waist.\u201cKak! Kuaah!\u201dKrein rolled on the ground while screaming as if he was facing his last moment.That\u2019s a marvelous scream. But his skull is still intact. Break it right now.\u2018Always the skull\u2026\u2019Raon shook his head and looked at the four collaterals, who were squirming on the ground.\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201dRaon turned his head and approached the collateral children with killing intent in his eyes.\u201cWaa!\u201d\u201cUhhh!\u201d\u201cWh-what\u2026\u201dThe collaterals shivered in anguish. Their expressions weren\u2019t just confused, but terrified.\u201cUhh\u2026\u201dKrein\u2019s teeth chattered, as if he were cold.\u2018What is this guy\u2026?\u2019It was a spirit that couldn\u2019t be felt from Burren, nor from the older children of the direct line. From Raon they felt something other than aura, something darker than that.\u2018It\u2019s like facing an adult\u2026\u2019And it wasn\u2019t just any adult. It was the same chilly feeling as meeting the eyes of one of the leading figures of the family.\u201cThe deeper the talk, the better.\u201d\u201cUugh!\u201d\u201cPl-please!\u2019As Raon approached with a smile, the collaterals\u2019 teeth chattered as if they were looking at a god of death.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Smack! Smaaack!Unable to even scream, the collaterals rolled up like maggots as he kept punching them.This is refreshing for once. It\u2019s the first time that I took a liking to you.\u2018Thank you, I guess.\u2019Raon kept beating up the collaterals, so much that Wrath applauded. Moreover, he was hitting where it hurt the most, although it didn\u2019t look obvious.\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cUwaa\u2026\u201dThe collaterals couldn\u2019t even meet Raon\u2019s eyes anymore. They were just curling up like shrimps, fresh out of water.\u201cPl-please, stop\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dRaon taught them a clear lesson. They shouldn\u2019t even look at his toes.\u201cWhat we had today was a talk between fellow trainees, right?\u201d\u201cEh, yes!\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cAm I right to assume that you won\u2019t tell anyone about our talk?\u201d\u201cOf\u2026 of course!\u201d\u201cDefinitely!\u201dSince Krein and the collaterals wanted to stop getting beaten up, they nodded their heads.\u201cThen let\u2019s get the finishing touch before ending our conversation.\u201d\u201cFi-finishing touch?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cWho convinced you to do this? Was it Burren?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry? N-no, that\u2019s not the case.\u201dThe collaterals shook their heads.\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201cLo-Lord Burren never ordered us to do th-this.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He actually told us to stop. It was just that we\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dRaon sneered. Judging from their frantic expressions, they weren\u2019t lying. Burren really must not have been involved.\u2018He isn\u2019t completely rotten.\u2019Burren clearly wasn\u2019t favorable to him, and had a foul mouth, but he didn\u2019t seem to be complete garbage.\u201cYou\u2019d better behave if you don\u2019t want to have another talk tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cCertainly!\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t even step on your shadow!\u201dRaon turned around, hearing the collaterals\u2019 responses. When he was about to leave the alley, a notification tone could be heard.Ding!***Tap.In the alley that Raon and the collaterals left, Rimmer stepped down.\u201cHmm!\u201dLooking at the collaterals, who were helpless as they left, he licked his lips.\u2018That was an entertaining sight.\u2019He was just wasting his time like always, but he ended up watching something great.\u2018I get more curious the more I watch him.\u2019The Raon that he saw today wasn\u2019t the pathetic patient that Glenn and Sylvia had mentioned.\u2018Is he a genius?\u2019Raon had never been taught martial arts. He had never hit anyone, nor was he ever hit by anyone. However, the movements that he had shown proved otherwise.He avoided the first fist with the least movement possible and struck back immediately after.He finished his second and third opponents before they could even grasp the situation with a single strike on their vitals. It was a bit rough, but his punches weren\u2019t at the level that a first timer could have pulled off.He\u2019d thought that he just had excellent willpower, but it also looked like he was talented in martial arts.\u2018I guess he isn\u2019t a Zieghart for nothing.\u2019Rimmer grinned, remembering how Raon beat up the collaterals and threatened them.It reminded him of the Glenn that he had met back in the days when he had thought he was the strongest. He didn\u2019t look exceptional at first, but he was more extraordinary than anyone when he acted.He had even managed to impress Rimmer, who used to despise humans. Needless to say, that was the type of man he was.\u2018On top of that\u2026\u2019The way Raon threatened the collaterals using their own words was even more like Glenn.\u201cA mysterious talent among the best talents\u2026\u201dRimmer cheerfully rolled on the ground.\u201cMy heart is racing.\u201dThe corners of lips twisted up smoothly.***Raon entered room 405, following the number on the key that the instructor gave him in front of the dormitory.It was a wide room, not much different from his room in the annex building. The bed looked comfortable, and there was enough space to train the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018Then\u2026\u2019After quickly looking around the room, he sat on the bed and brought up the message from earlier.<Wrath> is satisfied with your actions.Agility has increased by 1.It was a message telling him that his agility had increased, along with a message saying that Wrath was satisfied.\u2018I can increase my stats like this?\u2019Apparently, satisfying Wrath gave him points, just as withstanding his intervention did.However\u2026<Wrath> roars.It\u2019s a mistake! The King of Essence isn\u2019t satisfied! It\u2019s still not enough! You should have at least cut their heads off!Since Wrath was making a fuss, he got it regardless of Wrath\u2019s intentions.Those stats that you\u2019ve been getting! Where do they even come from?!Apparently, Wrath didn\u2019t know where the stats came from either.\u2018Do you not know either? It\u2019s your own ability, yet you know nothing.\u2019This all happened because you stole it from the King of Essence!\u201cWell, the fact still remains that you don\u2019t know.\u201dKuh\u2026Wrath\u2019s voice trembled, as if all his pleasure from earlier had vanished.Alright, I\u2019ll check on it. Wait for me.With that, Wrath\u2019s presence disappeared. The bracelet was still there, but his soul seemed to be gone. Raon tried swinging his hand, but nothing happened.\u201cIt\u2019s silent for once.\u201dRaon lowered his hand. Thinking that he would use this opportunity to take a bath, he headed to the bathroom on the fourth floor.After taking a quick bath, he returned to the room. Without even drying his hair, he sat down on the ground.\u2018He is actually a goose that lays golden eggs.\u2019He grinned, looking at the flowery bracelet on his wrist. Gaining stats for being acknowledged, or withstanding his interruption, was as good as getting them for free.Since he had the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Water Resistance\u2019, he wasn\u2019t going to lose to Wrath, either. Only benefits existed.\u2018Shall I train before he comes back?\u2019Satisfied, he closed his eyes to practice the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.It was as he was about to start the training that he heard it.Kuh!\u201cAre you back already?\u201dWhen he opened his eyes, clicking his tongue, Wrath was on his wrist and shivering.You thief!\u201cThief?\u201dYou were stealing the power that the King of Essence had left in the main body!\u2018Main body?\u2019When he thought about it, Wrath had said he was the king somewhere, calling himself the King of Essence. He didn\u2019t remember because it wasn\u2019t important.It\u2019s devildom! I was the monarch of the devildom!\u2018I see.\u2019He nodded slightly, since he wasn\u2019t interested.Crack!He could hear Wrath grinding his teeth.What\u2019s that answer?! You are just a dung fly, stealing the power of the King of Essence! You should kneel and worship me!\u201cYou aren\u2019t giving it to me because you want to, so is there any reason why I should be thankful?\u201dKuh\u2026Wrath just groaned, as he couldn\u2019t say anything about it.Your arrogance truly reaches heaven.\u201cNot really.\u201dRaon shook his head. He never thought about anything like that. Wrath was just too used to being worshiped, to the point that he couldn\u2019t handle direct answers.The body of the King of Essence is currently linked to you. That\u2019s why the status window has been passed on to you.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019So, I have a suggestion.\u201cSuggestion?\u201dLet\u2019s make a bet. If you win, I\u2019ll give you the stat points. But if you lose, you shall take my wrath.Wrath\u2019s voice contained anger and resentment, just like when he\u2019d met him the first time.<Wrath> has proposed a bet with you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The King of Essence doesn\u2019t lie, nor try to deceive you. I will show you myself.A new message appeared as soon as he said that.<Wrath> proposes the first bet.Condition: Pass the test for official trainees first in the list.Upon success: All stats +2, a random trait.Upon failure: Creation of 10 points of emotion in <Wrath>.He could understand what he meant upon reading the message. It looked like Wrath intended to hand over his own abilities if Raon managed to win the bet.\u201cAre you talking about ending up first in the test to become an official trainee that Rimmer mentioned?\u201dThat\u2019s right. He said that there will be a first place, so the result will be clear.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe still had a few questions.\u201cWhat do you mean, a random trait?\u201dOne of the traits that The King of Essence possesses will be granted to you. Of course, its level will be downgraded to match your mediocrity.\u201cA trait\u2026\u201dRaon looked at Wrath, who was burning as if fuel had been added. He had always called himself a monarch of devildom.He couldn\u2019t trust him on that, but it was obvious that he was a special existence. That meant that his random trait was most likely going to be a useful ability.\u201cOne more thing. This is the most important part. What do you mean by creating ten points of emotion in wrath upon failure?\u201dIt means what it says. You will gain the emotion of wrath, which the King of Essence possesses.\u201cAre you saying that you are capable of controlling my feelings?\u201dIt\u2019s not that much. I will be giving you a very small amount of wrath. It really is a little bit. However\u2026Wrath\u2019s voice contained an obvious expectation.Just like the saying goes, many a little makes a mickle.* If you keep taking in the King of Essence\u2019s wrath, you won\u2019t be able to control your emotions anymore\u2026 No matter how strong your willpower is.\u201cWas that your goal all along?\u201dRaon looked down on Wrath coldly. It seemed that he was trying to slowly take over his body, giving up on doing it at once.You should\u2019ve realized that your body changes according to the stats in the status window by now. If you partake in this bet, you will be one step closer to your revenge.Wrath calmly worked to convince him to accept his suggestion, despite being the King of Essence. Raon felt frustrated by him for the first time.\u2018Why is he making a bet like this?\u2019Since his main body existed still, he could\u2019ve just used that to conquer his mind. Raon couldn\u2019t understand why he had to use such an elaborate method instead.As I\u2019ve already said, the abilities of the main body of the King of Essence are connected to you. If I could use that power, I would\u2019ve taken over your body already.Wrath responded as if he read his mind.\u201cAre you sure there\u2019s no lie?\u201dThe King of Essence is a monarch of devildom. And a monarch of devildom doesn\u2019t lie.\u201cHaaah\u2026\u201dRaon sighed lightly. Wrath was certainly a psychopath, but he had never lied about anything when he answered him.\u201cDo I have no choice but to eat this poisonous apple?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t refuse, not when the reward was two points in all stats and a new special ability.On the other hand, the risk upon failure was relatively small\u2014if dangerous when accumulated.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThere were many outstanding children in the fifth training ground. Not just Runaan and Burren, but the collaterals and the recommended children also had special talents.An average child couldn\u2019t ever dream of being first place.However, he had been reincarnated.Whatever the test was, no matter how talented the children were, he was confident he wouldn\u2019t lose if he made use of his previous life.\u201cAlright, I accept.\u201dA wise decision.You have accepted the bet with <Wrath>.Raon looked into Wrath\u2019s eyes through the message. He was smiling, confident that he would win.So he smiled back.\u2018It won\u2019t go the way you think it will.\u2019***The Next Day, Before Dawn.Burren opened the door to the training ground and entered.Despite being so early that the sun hadn\u2019t even risen yet, his hair was properly brushed, and his training uniform was ironed out. He was indeed an exemplary noble.\u201cHmm?\u201dKrein and a few other collaterals, who used to greet him excessively, looked away after bowing awkwardly.\u2018Why are they doing that?\u2019He remembered the incident from the day before as he wondered.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 Did they harass him?\u2019Burren frowned. He didn\u2019t like Raon either, but harassing him personally was an act that would stain the name of Zieghart.\u2018Pathetic bastards.\u2019Just as he was about to approach the idiots to scold them, the door opened and Raon entered.\u201cHmm?\u201dHe was completely fine. There were no injuries nor bruises, so it didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d been hit. Instead, he looked even more confident than the day before.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cHie!\u201dOn the other hand, Krein and the collaterals hid in the corner like dogs as soon as they saw Raon.\u2018What? Just what happened?\u2019Burren swallowed. He couldn\u2019t understand what kind of situation this was.\u201cHey.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t stop himself from approaching the trembling collaterals.\u201cLo-Lord Burren!\u201dKrein and the other collaterals lowered their heads with gaping mouths.\u201cWhy are you trembling like that?\u201d\u201cTh-That is\u2026\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201dThe collaterals closed their mouths upon seeing Raon, not Burren. Fear could be seen in their eyes.\u2018They are afraid of Raon, instead of me?\u2019Just what did Raon do to them, for them to be so afraid?\u201cNo, nothing happened.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Nothing really happened.\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201dThe collaterals scratched their heads with awkward expressions.\u2018Did they get beaten up instead?\u2019That was the only possibility.The collaterals must\u2019ve been beaten up instead when they tried to teach him a lesson.Burren turned around to look at Raon. Just like the day before he was just standing silently, as if he wasn\u2019t interested.\u2018So he was hiding his abilities.\u2019It was laughable that a talentless patient would hide their puny level of skills.\u2018Struggle as much as you want.\u2019No matter what he did, he was going to remain at the bottom.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *While stretching his neck, Raon met the eyes of the collaterals that he\u2019d had a \u2018talk\u2019 with the day before.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cKuu!\u201dThe collateral children let out strange sounds and backed away.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dThe collaterals, who were openly insulting him the day before, were taken aback. The sight made the other trainees wonder about the situation.Raon turned his head at the scornful laughter. Burren was clearly jeering at him.\u2018I bet he\u2019s thinking that it doesn\u2019t matter, no matter what I do.\u2019Whatever Burren was thinking was as clear as day. He must\u2019ve been thinking that it was meaningless, no matter how much a talentless boy struggled.\u2018That\u2019s a huge mistake.\u2019Since Raon had the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, talent was meaningless. By the time he graduated from being a temporary trainee, he would be way ahead of Burren.That snake\u2019s eyes are annoying. Pluck them out.\u2018Not again.\u2019Back in the devildom, whoever dared to move their eyes would all\u2026\u2018Please shut up.\u2019Raon tapped his bracelet. With a zapping sound, Wrath went silent.Y-you bastard!\u2018You talk too much.\u2019The door to the training ground opened as he tried practicing with the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, ignoring Wrath.Stomp!Past the creaking door, Rimmer and the trainers entered.Unlike the trainers, who were properly lined up, Rimmer ran up to the platform with a skip to his steps.\u201cGood morning.\u201dRimmer smiled as he looked down at them.\u201cYes!\u201dThe temporary trainees responded loud and strong, despite it being so early in the morning.\u201cYesterday must\u2019ve been difficult since you ran at full speed\u2014even if you\u2019ve been training your stamina. So\u2026\u201dRimmer nodded his head and smiled.\u201cToday you\u2019ll run again. At full speed!\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cA-again?\u201d\u201cThe limit of a human\u2019s stamina increases each time it is exhausted. So, sprint until I tell you to stop.\u201dWhile the children were frowning, two people kicked the ground. It was Runaan and Burren.Pang!Unlike the day before, where they had been saving their stamina, they ran with everything they had.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a sprint again!\u201dThe children who thought that they were going to learn something that day started running, all while complaining.Are you running again? This is boring. You can become stronger without something like this. If you kill an enemy\u2026\u2018I\u2019m fine with this.\u2019Raon cut Wrath off. He kicked the ground after inhaling deeply.Really? Do you enjoy endlessly running and eating dust?\u2018I can become stronger by running.\u2019You idiot! If you leave your body to the King of Essence, you could become the strongest within a year\u2026\u2018But there\u2019s no point if I\u2019m not myself anymore.\u2019Stopping Wrath from talking any more nonsense, he kept moving his feet.\u2018I\u2019m faster than yesterday.\u2019Thanks to his increased agility and stamina, he could run faster than before.He could run as fast as some of the collaterals and recommended children, who he could only catch up to at the end of the test the day before.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cRa-Raon?\u201dThe eyes of children in the middle-lower group widened as they saw him. It looked like they couldn\u2019t understand how Raon was running alongside them.\u2018I\u2019m growing fast, for sure.\u2019Raon smiled lightly and ran with them. Having stat points on top of the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was making his growth unbelievably fast.However, despite running in full force, Burren and Runaan were getting farther and farther away. It looked like their talents and the amount that they had trained weren\u2019t at a level he could catch up to.Yet.\u2018It\u2019s not an unpleasant environment.\u2019They made him go all out, and there were many children to catch up to. It was the perfect environment to improve himself.Raon looked at Rimmer, who was dozing off on the platform. He was a frivolous guy, but his training method was reliable.\u2018Your training\u2026 I\u2019ll make good use of it.\u2019***\u201cStop!\u201dThe sprint that began before dawn only ended after the sun finished rising.\u201cKuah!\u201d\u201cHaah!\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dWithout exception, the children were panting and lying on the ground.Barely anyone was standing, as most of them had run at full speed.\u201cThis is the end of daybreak training.\u201d\u201cDay\u2026 daybreak\u2026\u201d\u201cNot even morning, but daybreak\u2026\u201dThe children shook their heads when they heard that daybreak training had ended.\u201cThe air is fresh at daybreak, and you can feel the mana more easily. You\u2019d better get used to it, since you will keep doing this even after you become an official trainee.\u201dRimmer spun his finger. It was a gesture describing how the children were going to run endlessly.\u201cNow, go get your breakfast.\u201d\u201cAfter running so much, how can we have breakfast\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t eat!\u201d\u201cNo way I can swallow!\u201dThe children complained, still lying on the ground.\u201cYou\u2019d better eat, even if it\u2019s difficult. Since training will continue, you won\u2019t be able to handle it without eating. Although, like always, the choice is yours.\u201dWith that, Rimmer left. It was as if he was telling them to do whatever they wanted.\u2018To tell us to eat after running so much\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I think I should eat. Even if I throw it up later\u2026\u201dThe children staggered as they went to the dining room. The food was light, not at all greasy. It seemed they had considered the intensity of daybreak training.Warm soup, soft bread, lean meat, and a few kinds of vegetables were the entirety of the menu.\u201cThe food is really terrible.\u201d\u201cI think I can eat this.\u201dThe collaterals looked at Raon who was just staring at the food on his plate.\u201cLook at him.\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t eating.\u201d\u201cI guess he can\u2019t eat that since he grew up sheltered in the annex building.\u201d\u201cTrue. Despite being the worst in rank, he must\u2019ve always gotten the better treatment as a patient.\u201dDespite the other children giggling as they mocked him, Raon was thinking about something completely different from their expectations.\u2018They give food?\u2019He would\u2019ve understood it if it was after training ended. However, he had never been given food during training in his previous life.Since he had eaten grass or hunted animals on his own to appease his hunger, even when he was younger than his current age, he had never imagined that they would feed him.\u2018This place is really the best!\u2019________________________T/N: \u2018Many a little makes a mickle\u2019 is a saying that means many little things add up into a large number of things, or a larger piece.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If such food were brought to me back in devildom, the King of Essence would have smashed the chef\u2019s head in.\u2018Huh? Did you taste it?\u2019The King of Essence can indirectly share your senses, especially your sense of taste. The King of Essence has been a well-known gourmet, back in devildom\u2026\u2018You really talk too much. You could\u2019ve simply said you could taste it because we share senses.\u2019Silence! The King of Essence is famous for his reticence\u2026 ugh!\u2018Stop talking for a bit. You are making it difficult for me to digest my food.\u2019Raon stopped Wrath from talking by tapping on his bracelet, then looked up on the platform.Rimmer was lying on the platform as if he was napping. He didn\u2019t show the slightest movement, as if he had become a statue.Just looking at him irritates me. I want to pluck off his pointy ears.Wrath was billowing ice from his mouth. It looked like he was boiling with anger whenever he saw Rimmer.\u2018The Sword of Light of Zieghart, huh\u2026\u2019Rimmer\u2019s prowess must\u2019ve been excellent, since he was called the Sword of Light of Zieghart. However, rumors said that his personality wasn\u2019t just light, but frivolous.Raon had thought that was bullshit. But looking at Rimmer, he realized it was incredibly accurate.\u2018But there\u2019s no openings.\u2019Despite his careless appearance, he wasn\u2019t showing any weakness.He\u2019d heard Rimmer had retired because of a severe injury, but apparently a master\u2019s prowess hadn\u2019t disappeared completely.The moment the King of Essence takes over your body, those ears will be plucked.\u2018Whatever.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t happen, though.Yawning, Rimmer lazily stretched long after all the temporary trainees had finished gathering.\u201cHave you finished eating?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSince the children\u2019s stamina didn\u2019t recover completely, their voices were more exhausted than at daybreak.\u201cThen we will start the next part of your training immediately.\u201dRimmer grinned. When he looked at the wooden swords placed on a side of the training ground, the children\u2019s expressions brightened.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a sword, just mimic my posture.\u201dAs if he was teasing them, he stood with his feet shoulder-width apart, then bent his knees.\u201cAre\u2026 are we not going to learn how to use a sword?\u201dOne of the collaterals shouted, raising his hand.\u201cWe aren\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWe thought we were going to learn with swords\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right. Sir Sword of Light is famous for his swordsmanship, so why\u2026?\u201d\u201cSword? That\u2019s all good, but can you run before learning how to walk?\u201dRimmer\u2019s corner of lips twisted up. His cool smile seemed to blow a chilly wind towards them.\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough stamina or willpower, nor do you have the proper posture yet. Do you think you can really learn how to handle a sword properly?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said this already, but you don\u2019t need to follow my instructions. Since the consequences are yours to manage, anyway.\u201dIt was a playful voice, but the training ground fell silent.\u201cFollow me if you want. Those who wish to do other training should move over to the right.\u201dNaturally, nobody moved. Everyone stood still and looked at Rimmer.\u201cThen let\u2019s start over. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Then, bend your knees with your thighs parallel to the ground.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe children followed the posture without difficulty.\u201cThis posture is called the riding position. It\u2019s how you ride a horse, and it\u2019s also a basic posture for every martial art\u2014including sword, spear, and fist. Keep the riding position until I tell you to stop.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe children raised their arms after answering loud and clear. Since it was one of the basic postures, nobody failed to follow it.Humans really are inferior, to train their bodies in such an awkward position.\u2018And you failed to take over such a human\u2019s body.\u2019Kuh! That\u2019s different\u2026\u2018I have to focus, so hush.\u2019Raon hit the flowery bracelet and closed his eyes.\u2018This is an important moment.\u2019Even in that kind of basic training, he could gain a lot by using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019. He could make his training way more efficient than the other children.\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a nap.\u201dRimmer laid down and started to doze off again, and the riding position continued forever.\u201cGroan\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cH-How long do we have to keep this up?!\u201dThe children\u2019s limbs trembled, as if there was an earthquake. Despite the riding position being a basic posture, it was their first time maintaining it for such a long time.There was an exception, though. The upper tier children, including Runaan and Burren, kept their proper posture.\u201cWh-what\u2019s wrong with that guy?\u201d\u201cHow is he able to hold on!\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 He was supposed to have the worst constitution!\u2019\u201cI heard he was a patient\u2026\u201dRaon kept his posture while sweating heavily. The posture\u2019s accuracy alone was better than anyone in the training ground.\u201cGaaaah!\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t lose to him.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll stop when he is holding on like that!\u201dThe children from the lower tier were about to give up. Upon seeing Raon still holding on, they kept their posture and grit their teeth.However, Raon still had enough stamina to spare, despite how he looked.\u2018This is easy.\u2019In his previous life, he trained the riding posture while carrying rocks on his back and thighs. He was even younger then than he was now. The current training was nothing compared to that time.Of course, the coldness spreading throughout his tired body was creating unbearable pain. He felt like his flesh was being torn apart, and his bone was being frozen, but it was an opportunity for him to become stronger.Whir.Raon took in the coldness in his body by rotating the rings of fire, all while keeping the riding position.As painful as it was, he could absorb a considerable amount of coldness, and the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 progressed further.At the rate he was going, he felt like he could easily win the bet against Wrath, although he must\u2019ve been unaware of it.When Raon was so focused that he almost forgot it was a training on the riding position, a clapping sound could be heard from above the platform.\u201cStop!\u201dWhen he came to, Rimmer stood up and nodded. The other children were sitting down massaging their thighs like they were dough.How long are you going to ignore the King of Essence!\u2018I\u2019m sorry, I missed it.\u2019You inferior bastard\u2026Wrath swore at Raon, who only stared in response. It looked like he\u2019d been mumbling all along.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dIgnoring Wrath, Raon kept relaxing his thigh and waist muscles with a refreshing breath.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Ding!An extreme stamina-surpassing action was performed.Stamina has increased.A message announcing an increase in stamina appeared once again. Feeling his vitality return to his trembling thighs, he stretched from his waist.\u201cJust like yesterday, some of you held on until the end while others gave up.\u201dLooking at those who were still standing, Rimmer wagged his finger.\u201cLet me repeat. I\u2019m just giving you the instructions. I won\u2019t directly interfere with your training. Break through your limits by yourselves. Give your mind a hard smack when it starts saying you did enough. That\u2019s how you will pass the test in six months.\u201dHe continued, maintaining his tricky smile.\u201cI won\u2019t repeat this again. From now on, I won\u2019t care whether you give up or hold on until the end anymore.\u201dAfter telling them to loosen up their thighs in preparation for the next day\u2019s training, Rimmer left.A mere pointy-eared bastard who believes in the nature god is talking about idealism. How ridiculous. And willpower is nothing in front of overwhelming power.\u2018That\u2019s not true.\u2019What do you mean?\u2018You do need willpower.\u2019Raon shook his head while loosening up his legs.You believe that because you are a weakling that has never felt an overwhelming power. If you felt the power of the King of Essence, you would be worshiping me right now\u2026\u2018I managed to withstand your attack with willpower.\u2019That\u2026 That\u2019s because the King of Essence hasn\u2019t recovered the original power yet!\u2018And I\u2019m just a kid.\u2019Th-that is\u2026Wrath\u2019s voice dropped powerlessly.\u2018Of course, willpower isn\u2019t meaningless.\u2019Willpower was similar to stamina and strength. There was a limit, but it got stronger the more it was used.He had been in many pinches in his previous life, and he had managed to survive because of his extreme stamina and willpower.\u2018Then let\u2019s get going.\u2019After loosening his thigh and hip muscles, he entered the indoor gymnasium.There were many training tools to help increase his strength and agility.Are you training again?\u2018Yes, I am.\u2019He nodded. The stats increased when they were pushed to the limit, like squeezing a dry mop trying to get water out of it.Raon didn\u2019t think of the extra training as something painful or boring. It was something to look forward to.He started with basic training, including pushups and planks.This is so annoying. It\u2019s like watching a caterpillar hanging on a tree.\u2018A caterpillar that can only crawl will one day become a butterfly and fly away.\u2019The only way for you to become a butterfly is to hand over your body to the King of Essence.\u2018That\u2019s not a butterfly. It\u2019s a poisoned moth. Stop daydreaming.\u2019Raon shook his hand and bent his arms once again. For push-ups, the number wasn\u2019t the important part. He slowly bent and stretched his arms in a way that would stimulate his muscles the most.He felt like his chest muscles were going to snap, but he welcomed that pain. It would become his stats and stamina.After push-ups, he started to exercise his abdominal muscles. That was when the other children started to enter the gymnasium.After throwing him a glance, they separated to start their own training.Runaan and Burren also entered and checked out the different equipment.Runaan isolated herself and got herself a tool, and Burren walked out after glaring at Raon for a bit.Burren went to where the wooden swords were placed and grabbed one to start swinging it.Woosh!The collateral children who usually followed Burren got themselves a wooden sword as well, and began to practice the swordsmanship that they had trained in.He grabbed a sword.\u2018He did.\u2019Aren\u2019t you going to do the same?\u2018I don\u2019t need it yet.\u2019What Raon needed wasn\u2019t a sword, but the stamina, strength, and agility to serve as a base.Burren and other children\u2019s swordsmanship wasn\u2019t even at a beginner level. For novices, training with swords without an instructor was just a waste of time.Without caring for what the others were doing, Raon continued the boring yet difficult training, only wishing to achieve more progress the next day.***Runaan Sullion wasn\u2019t interested in others.That didn\u2019t mean that she looked down on others due to her outstanding talents.It was because she had locked the door to her heart the day she had been terribly disappointed by the one she trusted.However, there was one person who had caught her eye recently.It wasn\u2019t Rimmer, the Sword of Light, nor Burren Zieghart, who everyone said was her rival.Raon Zieghart.Sylvia\u2019s son, who was kicked out of the direct line to become a collateral, kept attracting her attention.\u2018Why do I keep paying attention to him?\u2019It was the first time she was interested in someone or felt familiar with someone.\u2018Is it because of the coldness?\u2019Rumors said that Raon\u2019s mana circuit bore an extreme amount of coldness. It was possible that her frost ability was making her feel familiar with his coldness.\u2018That must be it.\u2019Since she realized the reason, she tried to stop paying attention to him.However, no matter how much she tried she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him.\u2018He is growing quickly.\u2019Raon\u2019s growth was abnormally fast.When she had seen him a month ago in the audience room, he had been a skinny boy with no muscles. However, he had gained some muscles since then.\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2019He was at the lowest tier the other day, but he had managed to catch up with the middle-lower tier.Everyone said Runaan herself was born with a heavenly talent, but she thought it was impossible for her to progress that quickly. It just didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201cHuff!\u201dComfortably lifting a 60kg weight, she kept stealing a glance at Raon.\u201cIt\u2019s really strange.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a good reason that it was called one of the most valuable treasures of the continents.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dSetting the weight to 5km heavier than the day before, Raon lifted the weight. He slowly moved in a way to maximize the range of motion of his pectoral muscles, to stimulate it as much as possible.Tap.When he got up after finishing six sets, he heard someone sitting down at the equipment next to him.\u2018Who is it?\u2019The only person who would come near him was the green-haired weirdo with a pocket on his belly. Raon thought it was strange and turned around.\u2018Runaan?\u2019The person sitting next to him was Runaan Sullion, with her long silver hair flowing down.Runaan set her weight to be a lot heavier than Raon\u2019s and started to use the equipment.\u201cHup!\u201dHer weightlifting posture was remarkably similar to Raon\u2019s. She didn\u2019t care about the lifting count nor the weight but focused on stimulating her muscles.What was that?\u2018I don\u2019t know, either.\u2019After watching her for a bit, Raon left. In order to stimulate his muscles more thoroughly, he sat on other training equipment.\u201cHup!\u201dAfter setting the load to exceed his maximum capacity, he lifted the weight while rotating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u201cHuff!\u201dHe normally should\u2019ve subtracted 10kg from that weight, but the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 allowed him to handle that much, and more often.He could hear someone sitting next to him again. He put the weight down after training until his arms and chest trembled.\u2018Really?\u2019He turned his head without getting up. As expected, Runaan was there. She set a weight higher than him once again and started to lift.\u2018Why is she doing this?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. Runaan didn\u2019t pay any attention to Rimmer, let alone other trainees. He couldn\u2019t understand why she was copying him, by lifting weights the exact same way he did.\u2018I must be mistaken.\u2019When he thought about it, it was normal to train the smaller muscles after training bigger muscles. Raon got up, thinking that it was just a matter of coincidence.However, he headed to the equipment to train shoulder muscles just to be sure.Creak!After setting the weight, he lifted it while feeling the stimulation to his shoulders. When he finished a set, Runaan appeared in front of him.After staring at him for a bit, she sat down next to him and set her weight. It was a heavier one, once again.\u201cHuff!\u201dShe casually started lifting the equipment while looking in front of her.Are you really going to do nothing after being provoked like this? How long are you going to hide like a rat!\u2018A provocation\u2026\u2019Raon turned his head to look at her. Runaan just kept lifting, as if she wasn\u2019t interested in him.\u2018What is she thinking?\u2019The first and second times could\u2019ve been coincidences. However, her copying his shoulder training couldn\u2019t have been one.Yet, he couldn\u2019t understand what she was thinking. Her eyes were as cold as ice, yet they were also blurry, making it impossible to grasp her intentions.You don\u2019t understand, huh? She is clearly provoking you by acting as if she is better than you. Punch her in the face, right now!Whether it was a child, an adult, or a woman didn\u2019t matter to Wrath. He was angry at everything, just like his name suggested.\u2018Please stop. For just a moment, just stop.\u2019Raon ignored Wrath\u2019s anger and left the equipment to start squatting. As expected, Runaan followed him and bent her thighs with a heavier weight.\u201cWh-what?\u201d\u201cWhy are those two together?\u201d\u201cWhy is Lady Runaan paying attention to that loser?\u201dThe children in the gymnasium opened their mouths wide, watching Runaan training right next to Raon.Screech.Burren, who came back to the gymnasium after swordsmanship training with the collaterals, grit his teeth.\u201cUhhh\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy is Runaan there\u2026?\u201dThe collaterals saw Runaan training next to Raon and glared at them.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon looked at Runaan, who attracted everyone\u2019s attention.With silver hair shining like moonlight, fair skin as white as snow, and thin and sharp facial features, she was an ethereal beauty. Except her eyes, which looked senseless, like she had a piece missing.\u201cDo you have something to say to me?\u201dWhen Runaan finished a set, he approached her.\u201c\u2026\u201dUpon hearing his question, she stared at him for a while, as if he was a curious creature.\u201cNo.\u201dAfter responding, she started to lift her equipment once again, with more weight this time.\u2018I don\u2019t know, either.\u2019Raon shrugged and got up from his equipment. Since she was going to lose interest soon anyway, he decided to just ignore her.As he was thinking about what to do since his routine was suddenly changed, he heard small stepping sounds behind him.When he turned around, he could see Runaan scanning different parts of his body with her purple eyes.\u201cIf you have something to say, say it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWithout responding, Runaan met his eyes. Her eyes looked like a cat that had just finished its nap.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon sighed quietly and walked over to another piece of training equipment. Runaan followed right after him and used the same equipment.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *One week had passed since Runaan Sullion began observing Raon Zieghart.\u201cHmm.\u201dShe looked for Raon as soon as she entered the indoor gymnasium. Like always, he was lifting weights before anyone else.\u2018It\u2019s heavier than yesterday.\u2019Raon\u2019s weight was 5kg heavier than the day before, which wasn\u2019t actually that strange.It wasn\u2019t strange to increase weight if you worked out hard enough.However, what if that weight increased every day? That wouldn\u2019t be normal.\u2018How is he doing that?\u2019Most people didn\u2019t realize it, but Raon Zieghart had increased the weight of his equipment by over 10kg last week. Even considering that growth was faster for a child, the number was ridiculous.\u2018He was supposed to be a patient\u2026\u2019His face was pale, and his limbs were as weak as twigs. However, he could withstand better than anyone in the training ground.\u2018Is it thanks to the posture?\u2019The posture Raon used to lift his weights was a bit different from the others. She thought his absurd speed of growth might have been thanks to that posture.With that conclusion in mind, Runaan sat on the equipment next to Raon, who was training his chest. She started to lift the weights the same way Raon did.\u2018Hmm.\u2019It didn\u2019t feel much different from usual. Only her muscles felt slightly more stimulated.\u2018It\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019Thinking that it was meaningless, she was about to go back to her usual posture.\u2018Huh?\u2019When she inhaled a cool and mysterious fragrance coming from Raon, her weight became as light as a feather.\u2018What happened?\u2019She felt like her strength and agility had suddenly increased. The weight that should\u2019ve been difficult to raise had become so light.However, once Raon\u2014who was watching her for a while\u2014left, that strange sensation immediately disappeared as well.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMissing the sensation, Runaan stared at Raon\u2019s back as he headed to the next piece of equipment.\u2018Perhaps\u2026\u2019Runaan followed Raon and moved next to him. She set her weight to be heavier than usual and lifted.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt looked like it was too much since it was too difficult to lift it. However, once Raon started to exercise, the cool air coming from him made her weight become lighter once again.\u2018That was it.\u2019It wasn\u2019t her imagination. She was capable of lifting a weight 10kg heavier than usual, as if her abilities really were enhanced.\u201cHuff!\u201dDespite lifting more than she could handle, it didn\u2019t seem to overload her shoulders nor arms at all.Once she cheerfully finished her exercise, Raon was standing in front of her.\u201cDo you have something to say to me?\u201dBlond hair and red eyes, the boy with the proof of his Zieghart heritage spoke.\u201cNo.\u201dRunaan shook her head, and Raon moved on to the next piece of equipment after staring at her for a moment.\u2018I should try following him around.\u2019Eyes shining like a cat\u2019s, she followed Raon.She liked that she could train with heavier weights, but she was even more attracted to the cool fragrance coming from him.***Rimmer climbed the mountain behind the main building in Zieghart.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe shook his head and clicked his tongue as he was about to climb up the flat rock at the mountainside.\u201cYou must be really worried about your grandson, to visit my napping rock every day.\u201dFrom the top of the rock, an old man who gave the impression of a sharp sword came down. It was Glenn Zieghart.\u201c\u2026\u201dWithout saying anything, Glenn stared at the barely visible mountain ridge.\u201cHmph.\u201dRimmer snorted and leaned back against the rock. The two of them watched the setting sun for a long time, not saying a word.\u201cHaaah\u2026 You should just ask instead of acting so dignified.\u201dRimmer sighed and jumped up on the rock where Glenn was sitting.\u201cThe children are doing great. They are training so hard that they are honestly exceeding my expectations.\u201d\u201cExceeding your expectations?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve let them train on their own accord.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d\u201cHonestly, a twelve- or thirteen-year-old child doesn\u2019t have much willpower. I thought most of them would start slacking after a week. However!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t exaggerating. When he planned his training, his intention was to pick about twenty people out of the one hundred sixty.\u201cMore of them are going to pass than I thought, thanks to my lord\u2019s grandson.\u201d\u201cMy grandson? Are you talking about Burren?\u201d\u201cStop pretending when you already know I\u2019m talking about Raon.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened on the training ground. You told me to not mind it, since you would take care of it.\u201d\u201cHah, seriously?\u201dRimmer scratched his red hair. It was annoying that this old man, who had been waiting for him because he was worried about his grandson, was pretending he didn\u2019t know anything.\u201cThat guy, he is different from what my lord and Sylvia believe.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dGlenn\u2019s eyes were the same, but his voice was clearly different.\u201cYou wanted him to drop out as soon as possible to avoid getting hurt, since he was weak both mentally and physically.\u201d\u201cI never said that. I just told you to not discriminate.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I also tried to fail him out as fast as possible.\u201dRimmer\u2019s blue eyes shone.\u201cHe\u2019s a monster. His willpower isn\u2019t anywhere near normal. It\u2019s even better than a warrior who has gone through tens or hundreds of battlefields.\u201dRimmer had seen plenty of talents throughout his life, and even among them, Raon was exceptional. It was difficult to believe how much he had grown, that he had to look at him twice every morning.\u201cWhen the training started, Raon was one of the worst among the one hundred sixty people. Only three weeks later, he\u2019s in the middle tier. Do you think that should be possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI once thought that Raon wasn\u2019t actually a patient and was just hiding his strength. However, that isn\u2019t possible. His body still has a brutal coldness running through it.\u201dRecently, he kept paying attention to Raon during training, as he really went all out on every moment.\u201cI\u2019m considering singling him out to give him personal training.\u201dSince he did his best in the training that he had prepared, Rimmer couldn\u2019t help but feel more affection for Raon than the others.\u201cYou would go that far?\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t stop, even if his body becomes frosty like a winter tree. The other children are training hard because they are stimulated by him. He is the fifth training ground\u2019s stimulant.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn scratched his chin with an expressionless face, but he couldn\u2019t hide his slight rise to the corner of his lips.\u201cIt looks like a lot more children will end up passing than I expected.\u201dDespite murmuring it was bothersome, his eyes were smiling.\u201cIsn\u2019t it overloading Raon\u2019s body?\u201dGlenn finally spoke.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer secretly gulped.\u2018It\u2019s more than I thought.\u2019He already knew that Glenn had a special affection for Raon, but he didn\u2019t think he would specifically ask that.It looked like the affection he couldn\u2019t give to his youngest daughter was transferred to Raon.\u201cWell, that part is a bit strange. He is certainly overworking himself, but he recovers so quickly that it\u2019s mysterious.\u201d\u201cIs it impossible to figure out, even for you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s the first time my eyes can\u2019t grasp someone after the Ten Heavens of the Continent.\u201dRimmer tilted his head as he answered. He was better than anyone at analyzing others\u2019 potential or condition, but Raon was different.Honestly, Raon was more mysterious than Glenn, who rose to the rank of the continent\u2019s strongest.\u201cRimmer.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t Raon\u2019s personal instructor, but the head instructor of the fifth training ground. Pay attention to everyone who will become the family\u2019s strength, instead of only thinking about Raon.\u201dGlenn walked down the mountain after saying that with a lot of dignity.\u201cHah.\u201dRimmer snorted to that ridiculousness.\u201cWhat the hell is he saying when he came to listen to Raon\u2019s story?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInside the lord\u2019s manor, which resembled a gigantic sword in its sharp atmosphere, its owner\u2014Glenn Zieghart\u2014was sitting on the throne with narrow eyes.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019There was something that the bum called the Ragged Saint had said.\u2018There are cases of them having exceptional talent.\u2019Patrick had mentioned that there were cases of children born with the Curse of Frost being exceptionally talented.\u2018Did that talent manifest?\u2019If that wasn\u2019t the case, then there was no way Raon would still be taking the elixir.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn groaned. It wasn\u2019t a demeanor he could show to the others as the Destructive King of the North.\u2018It was a mistake, a huge mistake.\u2019There was a time when his emotions were as dry as the desert\u2019s sands, from breaking through his martial arts realm.Sylvia was born at that time. He didn\u2019t give her any love, unlike the other children. He was more like a trainer than a father, as he just raised her by giving her tasks.As such, Sylvia didn\u2019t get any love from her father nor her mother, and she didn\u2019t get any affection from her siblings, either. She ended up living like a creaking marionette and left the family with a man she met from the outside.\u2018I really didn\u2019t feel anything back then.\u2019Glenn knew that her siblings\u2019 slander and the subordinates\u2019 revolt were among the reasons why she left, but he didn\u2019t really care.That was because it didn\u2019t matter to him what happened to Sylvia. Back then, his only concern was becoming more powerful and making the family bigger and stronger.And five years after that, he finally realized it after regaining his human emotions when he broke through another hellish wall of martial arts. The fact that he had made a huge mistake that couldn\u2019t be reversed.Sending the bodyguards after her, he managed to save Sylvia\u2014and Raon inside her womb\u2014but his son-in-law and the granddaughter he hadn\u2019t even met were mere pools of blood.\u2018How pathetic.\u2019He bit his lips from his embarrassing past. Zieghart\u2019s head of house, the Destructive King of the North, the Sword Emperor. He was called by different names, but none of them could reverse his past mistake.He was on extremely bad terms with Sylvia, and it was impossible to recover.\u2018Raon.\u2019That\u2019s why he resolved to protect his youngest grandson no matter what, even if that would make him hated by Sylvia and Raon as a result.Knock knock.When he was steeling his resolution, he heard someone knock on the door.\u201cHaaah\u2026\u201dWiping the exhaustion from his expression, he opened his mouth with cold dignity.\u201cEnter.\u201d***Raon entered the indoor gymnasium, excitement pulsing through his veins.\u2018I finally feel warmed up.\u2019Thanks to the two weeks of constant training, he managed to get up to the level of the middle-tier group.At that rate, it looked like he would catch up to Burren and Runaan\u2019s level before the test.\u2018Let\u2019s start today\u2019s training.\u2019When he lifted the shoulder equipment, Runaan approached to his left.\u201cHuff!\u201dShe started lifting a weight way heavier than his with a glazed expression, as if she were going to start drooling.The dumb looking girl is here again.\u2018Let her be.\u2019Since she wasn\u2019t bothering him, he ignored her and kept working.This time around, he could hear someone sitting down on his right side.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Am I bothering you?\u201dThe green-haired trainee with a pocket on his belly was scratching his head. He was the only one who would speak to him.\u2018His name was Dorian.\u2019He got scared by Rimmer\u2019s instructions each time, but he was fast-footed and tenacious.\u201cDo you want some?\u2019Dorian offered him round crackers from his belly pocket again.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaon unintentionally took it. When he was about to give it back, he could feel a powerful gaze from his side. Runaan\u2019s purple eyes were sparkling like a snow field.It\u2019s my first time seeing that dumb girl with that expression.\u2018Does she like crackers?\u2019Her eyes were fixated on the cracker.\u201cDo you want it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon extended the hand holding the cracker towards her. After thinking about it for a bit, moving her finger like a wild cat, she took the cracker.\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201dShowing her appreciation to Raon and Dorian, she bit the cracker like a rabbit nibbling a leaf.Her lips drew a soft arc, looking like she enjoyed the cracker.She was like a cat when she took it, and a rabbit when she ate it, and an idle puppy at other times. She was peculiar in many ways.\u201cErm\u2026 Sir Raon?\u201dDorian turned his head, after putting the rest of his crackers back to his pocket.\u201cCan I also train next to you?\u201dHe said he wanted to learn the posture as well.\u201cIf you want.\u201dRaon nodded. His quick progress was thanks to the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and his experience from his previous life. Copying his posture was not an issue.\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dWaving his hand at Dorian\u2019s expression, he focused on his lifting once again.Creak!When he was stimulating his muscles as much as possible, he could hear Dorian\u2019s equipment moving at the same speed and range, and the same could be heard from his left side, where Runaan was located.\u2018They\u2019re weirdos.\u2019The King of Essence likes the guy that looks like a green racoon.\u2018Why?\u2019He bowed to the King of Essence. This is the first respect I\u2019ve received since I woke up.\u2018\u2026\u2019Raon wanted to tell him that it wasn\u2019t directed at him, but since it would be annoying, he didn\u2019t say it.\u2018There are two children around me.\u2019***Five Weeks In.Raon passed the middle-tier in the daybreak sprint and caught up to the middle-upper tier.During that evening\u2019s training, another person was added to his group, on top of Runaan and Dorian.Ten Weeks In.Raon was the fastest among the middle-upper tier, and one more trainee was added to his group that evening.Fifteen Weeks In.Raon caught up to the highest tier. The six people next to him also improved drastically.* * *Four months had passed since the fifth training ground\u2019s temporary training had begun.Rimmer kept instructing various kinds of training, and the difficulty kept increasing as well.Training began before daybreak and continued into the evening, and even the children from the upper-tier, who had excellent stamina, were starting to show their exhaustion.Of course, the training was fundamentally the same.Everything was up to the trainee\u2019s decision, including the daybreak and afternoon training that Rimmer instructed, and the independent training that happened in the evening.Rimmer and the instructors never scolded anyone for giving up or skipping the independent training.If trainees asked for a posture or advice, they thoroughly taught them, but that was it. They never told them to work harder, nor to work out more regularly. At that point, they seemed more like observers rather than instructors.Leaving twelve- to thirteen-year-old children to decide everything was an innovative way of teaching.In fact, the collateral and recommended children, who were proud of their abilities, didn\u2019t do their best. They completely skipped the independent training.They seemed to believe that they could become official trainees without going through all that.However, there was one person who made them change their mind.Raon Zieghart.The infamous boy started to change the fifth training ground for the better.When training first began, Raon\u2019s stamina was at the lower-tier.He managed to run until the end of the first sprint, but he couldn\u2019t catch up to the middle-tier, and his face had become as pale as a dying man.But he kept running.He managed to withstand training that made even those with better stamina give up. When it came to the independent training, he was the first to start and the last to leave.He wasn\u2019t just panting but breathing out white steam as he trained, and he showed results the next day.His stamina, strength and agility all improved drastically, that he had gone from the lower-tier to tenth among the one hundred sixty trainees in ranking.The children that saw it happening right in front of their eyes were speechless.The collaterals, the children from vassal families, and the recommended children didn\u2019t take it easy anymore. They started to do their best and didn\u2019t skip independent training.Raon, who was a laughingstock, had become their rival.Of course, that wasn\u2019t the case for everyone.Burren and the collaterals that followed him still believed that training their stamina to that extent was unnecessary and practiced the sword and fist that their families had taught them.And time passed, with everyone doing their best in their own way.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHuff!\u201dRaon exhaled violently while sprinting during daybreak.His stamina and agility had increased a lot, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that running at full force exhausted him.\u2018But something did change.\u2019The countless children that were running ahead of him weren\u2019t there anymore.Thanks to his improved stats and the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, there were less than ten trainees ahead of him.Pathetic. It\u2019s been so long, yet you still have so many insects ahead of you.\u2018You should say that it\u2019s amazing how fast I\u2019ve improved.\u2019Wrath was the same as always. He was always complaining, asking him to hand over his body.\u2018I thought I could catch up to them soon enough, but those two are certainly different.\u2019Raon caught the sight of Runaan and Burren running the farthest away. He knew it already, but they were on a whole different level from the other children.They were born with the best talents, had a strong willpower, and were properly educated by their family to never become lazy.There was a twisted side, but it wasn\u2019t strange considering they were just twelve-year-old children.\u2018Shall I run a bit more today?\u2019Raon kicked the ground, making the best of his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.He felt like his lungs were being torn apart like paper, but he used the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 to support himself and kept running.\u201cWh-what?!\u201d\u201cRaon Zieghart!\u201d\u201cShit!\u201dThe highest tier children glared at him as Raon outran them.Swoosh!Burren and Runaan looked back, hearing the wind coming from behind them.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBurren frowned deeply, and Runaan\u2019s eyes sparkled like a cat having found a jewel.They turned back and started running again, as if telling him to try following them.\u2018They are certainly different. However\u2026\u2019Raon lifted his corner of lips as he watched their backs.\u2018The remaining time should be enough.\u2019Considering the rate at which he had been growing, he estimated that he would pass them in stamina, strength and agility before the test occurred.Although, if they used their aura, it would\u2019ve been a different story.\u2018Aura\u2026\u2019The children from the direct line, the collateral line, and the vassal families\u2014including Runaan and Burren\u2014had all learned how to train their aura.On the other hand, despite cultivating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, Raon didn\u2019t have a single speck of aura inside him.\u2018I do need to learn it\u2026\u2019When he thought about learning aura, he was perplexed.\u2018The one I used before isn\u2019t too bad.\u2019The cultivation technique of the shadow aura that he had learned in his previous life was pretty decent.It could be learned quickly, it was deceitful, and it was so sharp that it was excellent at assassination and fighting people.\u2018However\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t become the best with the shadow aura. Since he decided to live as a warrior instead of an assassin, he had to learn a better cultivation technique for his aura.\u2018And I\u2019ll need accomplishments for that.\u2019The Glenn he\u2019d seen and the Glenn he\u2019d heard of were the exact same. A cold-blooded person who only thought of his family, he was strict with rewards and punishments.If he graduated first place in basic training, he was certainly going to reward him accordingly.\u2018My goal is clear.\u2019In order to return Sylvia to where she belonged, to learn a better cultivation technique, he had to train harder.What are you doing? Stop being satisfied with outrunning those insects and catch up to those two. I can\u2019t bear to see them running ahead of the King of Essence.Wrath\u2019s turbulent anger agitated his emotions. A new message appeared as Raon kept running and withstanding it.Successfully withstood <Wrath>\u2019s interruption.Stamina has increased.Hmph. Again?!Raon nodded as Wrath boiled with his anger.\u2018And I should make effective use of him, too.\u2019***\u201cThat\u2019s it for today\u2019s training. Do your independent training now if you want.\u201dRimmer left as soon as the afternoon training ended. He was humming and murmuring that he was going to drink.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dBurren exhaled in irritation, watching his back.\u2018I really don\u2019t like him.\u2019He knew Rimmer was called the Sword of Light, but he behaved like a good-for-nothing.He was just lying down watching when he was supposed to instruct, and he wasn\u2019t interested in the independent training, either.Despite that, he was going to evaluate Burren to see if he could be an official trainee. He looked like a grasshopper that only knew how to jump around.\u201cLord Burren, aren\u2019t you going to do your independent training today?\u201dWhile he was frowning at Rimmer\u2019s back, Krein and the other collateral children approached him. They had become rather close by now.\u201cI\u2019m going to.\u201dBurren nodded and grabbed his wooden sword. The pleasant weight in his hand made him smile.\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dBurren and the other collateral children spread out and started to train their swordsmanship.Because he was so focused on it, Burren only stopped once the sun had completely set.\u2018I feel the most comfortable when I\u2019m training with a sword.\u2019His irritation died down when he trained the swordsmanship his father had taught him.\u201cThat\u2019s it for today.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThank you for your effort.\u201dAt Burren\u2019s command, the children bowed respectfully. Despite being the youngest of them all, he naturally became their leader with his position as a part of the direct line and his amazing talent.\u201cFollow me if you want to train further.\u201dAfter putting down his wooden sword, he entered the indoor gymnasium and frowned.\u2018That guy.\u2019Raon was training his strength with equipment, and a few trainees\u2014including Runaan\u2014were next to him.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dBurren breathed out his boiling anger. What annoyed him the most wasn\u2019t actually Rimmer or the other instructors.\u2018Raon Zieghart.\u2019That boy, who he hadn\u2019t been paying attention to because he was of the lowest rank, was becoming increasingly irritating.\u2018Why is she next to him?\u2019Runaan was as talented as he was, and was a daughter of Sullion, the strongest vassal family. He couldn\u2019t understand why she would stick to Raon.\u2018Damn it.\u2019He\u2019d thought of her as his rival, yet she was just following Raon around. That fact was making him boil with anger.Moreover, some of the recommended children that he\u2019d thought well of were also following Raon around, which annoyed him even more.\u201cPlease don\u2019t mind them. They are just impaired birds flocking together.\u201d\u201cEven the best vassal family is just a vassal family, after all.\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t even do anything together.\u201dThe collaterals sneered at Raon and Runaan, but Burren didn\u2019t laugh.It was a fact that Runaan was way more talented than the collaterals behind him.\u201cTsk.\u201dBurren clicked his tongue and entered the gymnasium.Sitting next to Raon and Runaan, who were training their lower bodies, he started lifting a weight heavier than they were.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cAmazing, Lord Burren!\u201d\u201cHow is he lifting that much\u2026\u201dEveryone in the gymnasium exclaimed and clapped their hands.Despite receiving gazes filled with admiration and amazement, Burren\u2019s expression stiffened like the bark of a tree.\u2018Those bastards!\u2019Raon and Runaan kept training without even taking a glance at him.Thud!Burren dropped down the weight violently and stood up, but the two didn\u2019t even turn their heads. As if they were competing with each other, they were only focused on their own equipment.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dBurren\u2019s face grew as red as an apple. He slammed the door open and left the gymnasium.\u2018Let\u2019s see if you can still make that face after I end up in first place by an overwhelming difference!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, since it was the day of the test, he was still relaxing.Raon Zieghart.As he was getting dressed after wiping his face, Wrath spoke to him.\u201cWhat?\u201dDo you remember your bet with the King of Essence?\u201cOf course.\u201dRaon nodded, putting on his training uniform. He obviously didn\u2019t forget that Wrath offered to give things out for free.I admit that your progress was rather fast for a human, but you didn\u2019t manage to catch up to those two. Are you prepared to take in the King of Essence\u2019s wrath?Wrath wasn\u2019t wrong. Despite running for three months, he didn\u2019t manage to run past Runaan or Burren.However, the test was a different story. It didn\u2019t matter whether he had to spar with them or had to show how much stamina he had accumulated.He was confident that he would win if he used the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and his experience from his previous life.\u201cThe proof of pudding is in the eating.\u201dThere is no point in bluffing. The King of Essence is soon going to take over your soul and body.\u2018Then tell me about it when that happens.\u2019I\u2019m looking forward to the day your confidence crumbles.\u2018That won\u2019t happen.\u2019Raon waved his hand.\u2018It\u2019s difficult to live with an enemy.\u2019Wrath trying to interfere with his emotions wasn\u2019t a big deal, but his talkativeness was rather annoying.He couldn\u2019t understand how one that called himself a monarch of devildom could talk so much.\u2018It does have its merits, though.\u2019Wrath\u2019s interruption ended up granting him a fair number of stats. It was a bit painful, but Wrath was like the goose that laid golden eggs.<Status Window>Name: Raon Zieghart.Title: None.State: Curse of Frost (Eight Strands), Poor Stamina, Decline in Athletic Ability, Decline in Mana AffinityTrait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Three-Stars), Water Resistance (Three-Stars)\u2014Strength: 25Agility: 24Stamina: 23Energy: 15Perception: 44It wasn\u2019t just the numbers. His body\u2019s actual abilities had improved drastically, to the point that his movements couldn\u2019t even compare to how they used to be.Kuh! The status window of the King of Essence\u2026Despite Wrath\u2019s groan, Raon smiled in satisfaction and walked out into the lobby.They look like they are facing death.\u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019The children gathered in the lobby looked extremely worried, like soldiers being dragged into a war.\u2018It must be because of the test.\u2019Rimmer didn\u2019t explain anything about the kind of test it was going to be, nor its difficulty or how many people were going to pass.He only said that they could pass if they did their best, so it was just a matter of course that the children were worried.Raon thought that he would\u2019ve been making the same expression if he hadn\u2019t been reincarnated, or if he didn\u2019t have the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.How pathetic of them to look like a defeated chicken before the real war even begins.\u2018They are still children.\u2019Raon looked around the depressed children, then walked outside.You are a child as well.\u2018I\u2019m different.\u2019Hmph, humans like to believe they are special.\u2018\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t respond to Wrath\u2019s provocation, since there was no need to confess that he had been reincarnated.Swoosh.As he was walking towards the fifth training ground next to the dormitory, light steps could be heard.And here she comes again.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes and looked back. A purple eyed girl with silver hair flowing down her shoulders was following him.\u201cRunaan.\u201dIt was Runaan Sullion. After sticking to him during independent training, she was also following him from the dormitory.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dRunaan turned her head with a mindless expression. With her hands behind her back, she looked away awkwardly.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dRaon sighed and turned back. Runaan was always like that. She\u2019d silently walk up to him and copy his training while spacing out.\u2018I don\u2019t know why she follows me.\u2019From what could be seen, Burren\u2019s abilities were better than his. He possessed splendid swordsmanship, excellent physical abilities, and pretty decent leadership.However, Runaan didn\u2019t seem interested in him at all. She just followed Raon around, resembling a stray cat that would follow the person that fed them around.\u2018But I didn\u2019t even feed her.\u2019He did give her a cracker before, but it was Dorian\u2019s. He didn\u2019t actually do anything for her, so he couldn\u2019t understand why she would follow him like a duckling followed its mother.\u2018She\u2019s eccentric.\u2019Raon shook his head and made for the training ground. When he arrived, a green-haired boy waved at him.\u201cY-young master\u2026\u201dIt was Dorian, who was the second person to start following him. His hands and legs were trembling, as if he were cold.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? Are you sick?\u201d\u201cN-no, I\u2019m not. There\u2019s a test today, and I didn\u2019t manage to get any sleep, because I was too worried. Ugh.\u201dThe bags under Dorian\u2019s eyes were as black as coal. Those bags clearly showed his exhaustion.\u201cYou should pass without any problem, though.\u201dRaon glanced past him. Dorian was always scared, but the number of trainees who could best him in terms of talent and tenacity could be counted on ten fingers. There was no way he would fail as long as he showed his abilities.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what the test is, and I\u2019m super weak! There is nothing I can do!\u201dDorian dry heaved and bit his nails with trembling lips. It didn\u2019t look like he was acting, as he seemed really scared.He is the bona fide insect among all the insects I\u2019ve seen. Crush his head already.\u2018You\u2019ve said before that you liked him.\u2019The King of Essence doesn\u2019t need a coward.\u201cIt will be fine.\u201dInstead of encouraging him, Raon told him it as a fact and walked past him. Despite his timid personality, throwing up didn\u2019t stop him from training. No matter what the test was, he was certainly going to manage.\u201cS-Sir Rimmer keeps his word. He said he would discern gems from pebbles, so a pebble like me will fail for sure.\u201d\u201cThen go ahead and fail.\u201d\u201cEek! Young master Raon!\u201dRaon waved his hand without looking back. He was just a stranger to him, so he didn\u2019t need to give more advice than it was necessary. Talking to him was starting to make him feel depressed as well.\u201cHmm.\u201dAs he was about to enter the training ground, he met Burren\u2019s eyes. He was walking towards him from the side.Upon seeing Raon, Runaan, and Dorian, his eyes burned with anger, as if he were looking at his archenemy.\u201cHaah.\u201dRaon sighed heavily.\u2018There isn\u2019t a single normal person around me.\u2019In his previous life, he was surrounded by madmen. It looked like his current life wasn\u2019t much different.Pluck out his eyeballs.\u2018Including him\u2026\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cYoung master Raon!\u201dAs Raon was warming up inside the training ground, a familiar voice was heard from his right side.\u201cMom? Helen?\u201dSylvia, Helen, and the maids from the annex building were running towards him.\u201cRaon!\u201dUpon reaching him, Sylvia hugged him tightly\u2014like a bird embracing its egg.\u201cOh my god! Your face has become so skinny! It must\u2019ve been hard, are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?\u201dTears welled up in her narrowed eyes. Despite what she said, Raon had gotten thicker with muscles, and by no means was skinny.\u201cNo Mom, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must\u2019ve been hard! Going through so many hardships\u2026 Sniff.\u201dDespite six months having passed, Sylvia was still the same. She didn\u2019t listen to him at all, and just worried about his body.Even you look like a child in front of your mother.\u2018Shut up.\u2019Wrath chuckled, pleased that he saw something interesting.\u201cYoung master. You\u2019ve done well.\u201dHelen bowed, smiling lightly. The maids behind her also smiled, telling him that he was amazing.\u201cI didn\u2019t even pass the test yet, though.\u201dRaon scratched his face. The embarrassment from being praised for nothing was making him itchy.\u201cYou held on for six months.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the amazing part!\u201d\u201cYes. You really did great.\u201dHelen and the other maids kept complimenting him nonstop. It was a natural reaction since they\u2019d expected him to fail and return right away.\u201cHow did you get here?\u201dRaon pushed back Sylvia, who was rubbing her cheeks against his, and turned his head to Helen.\u201cThe guardians are allowed to witness the test today. It\u2019s not only us, but others are also here.\u201dHe looked around following Helen\u2019s gesture. Just as she said, children were greeting their parents all over the training ground.\u201cBut who is she\u2026?\u201dSylvia\u2019s eyes widened as she spotted Runaan standing behind Raon. Runaan bowed to Sylvia.\u2018This girl is amazing.\u2019Runaan didn\u2019t stop following Raon, despite Sylvia and Helen coming to see him. That personality of hers was more amazing than her talents.\u201cRunaan!\u201dWhile Runaan and Sylvia were looking at each other, a thick voice could be heard from the left side. It was a middle-aged man with slicked back silver hair.\u2018Rokan Sullion.\u2019He was Rokan Sullion, the head of the vassal family Sullion, and Runaan\u2019s father.That dumb girl\u2019s face doesn\u2019t change, even at the end.Like Wrath said, Runaan\u2019s eyes stayed hazy as she looked at her father for the first time in six months.\u201cFather?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here? Let\u2019s go!\u201dAfter glaring at Raon and Sylvia, he grabbed her hand and dragged her away.\u2026 I\u2019ve seen many humans before, but that one is really\u2026 special.\u2018I know, right?\u2019He smirked bitterly at Runaan, who kept looking at him while being dragged away.\u201cRunaan is the youngest daughter of the Sullion family, right? The one who was at the Judgment Ceremony with you.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou two became friends, right?\u201dSylvia smiled. Asking him how they became friends, she looked at him closely.\u201cWe aren\u2019t friends.\u201dRaon shook his head firmly.\u201cYou aren\u2019t friends? Then what are you?\u201d\u201cI wonder\u2026\u201dHe honestly wasn\u2019t sure about his relationship with Runaan. He didn\u2019t even know what a friend was in the first place.\u201cMy son, if people approach you, you should be friendly to them instead of pushing them away.\u201dSylvia pouted.\u201cI\u2019ve never done that.\u201dHe just didn\u2019t care whether they approached him or not.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that! Bring her to the annex building next time. Mommy will prepare delicious food for you.\u201d\u201cI already told you we aren\u2019t friends.\u201d\u201cAww, I\u2019m really dying\u2026 Ah? Aren\u2019t you\u2026 Young master Raon\u2019s mother?\u201dWhile Raon was giving an evasive answer, Dorian\u2014who had been retching\u2014walked up to them with round eyes.\u201cYes. And who are you?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026 My name is Dorian! The young master has been taking care of me! Please accept my greetings!\u201dDorian bowed until his head almost hit the ground.\u201cOh my!\u201d\u201cOh, young master!\u201dSylvia and Helen smiled widely. The fact that Raon had been helping someone was making them happy.\u201cI was wondering why young master Raon was so handsome, but it was thanks to you! You\u2019re really beautiful!\u201dDorian took out a flower from his belly pocket and handed it to Sylvia. He couldn\u2019t talk at all when he was scared, yet his speech and actions didn\u2019t show a speck of hesitation. Raon wondered what the hell was wrong with him.\u201cOhoho! Thank you.\u201dSylvia smiled, accepting the flower. She seemed to really appreciate it from the way she was looking at them.\u201cGo away now.\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201dRaon tapped Dorian, trying to push him away, but Sylvia interrupted.\u201cDorian, can you tell me about how Raon has been doing?\u201d\u201cOf\u2026 of course! Young master Raon has gone up from the lowest tier to the highest tier, making history in the fifth training ground! Everyone watching him has been moved to tears\u2026\u201d\u201cHoo!\u201dDorian kept talking as if he were trying to overcome his nervousness with chatter. The test hadn\u2019t even started yet, but Raon felt already exhausted.It\u2019s outrageous how much that human talks.\u2018Still not as much as you.\u2019\u201c\u2026And just like that, thanks to young master Raon teaching us his posture, me and the other recommended children in the lower-tier managed to climb to the middle-upper tier. As for everything else, I\u2019ll tell you later! I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry right now!\u201dDorian bowed to her, then ran towards the toilet.\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master Raon!\u201dHelen and the other maids were moved to tears as they put their hands together. If they had listened any longer, they might have really started to cry.\u201cHelping others is nice and all, but how about you? You still get cold easily. Is the dormitory warm enough? Are you sick at all?\u201dBut Sylvia\u2019s eyes seemed more worried than moved. She was as true to her emotions, as always.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dRaon tapped his chest with a confident smile. But it wasn\u2019t enough to make all the worries disappear from Sylvia\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019m going to repeat myself, but you can stop whenever it\u2019s difficult. Don\u2019t mind the others, just follow your heart. Okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe nodded and Sylvia\u2019s worries seemed to fade away a little. She was still the same, she has always been the mother who worried about her son\u2019s well-being.\u201cBy the way, Helen.\u201dSylvia slightly turned her head with a mischievous look.\u201cYes, Lady Sylvia?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think Raon has gotten cuter in the time he\u2019s been away?\u201d\u201cCertainly. As expected of milady\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cRight? Raon! Let Mommy hug you one more time\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh! W-wait!\u201dWhen Raon tried to step back from the approaching Sylvia, pressure appeared at the entrance of the training ground.\u2018This power\u2026\u2019Raon clenched his teeth and stared at the main entrance. Frightening pressure could be felt from beyond the brown door.Wham!When the door to the training ground opened wide, a man that he\u2019d thought would never come appeared.\u201cGr-greetings, my lord!\u201d\u201cGreetings, my lord!\u201dIt was Glenn. Everyone who faced the head of House Zieghart knelt.\u2018Why is he here?\u2019\u201cFather?\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dSylvia and Helen also knelt and bowed.So, he was the owner of the power I felt from afar. To think that someone like that exists in this era\u2026Wrath spoke with admiration for the first time since waking up. It seemed like Glenn\u2019s prowess was impressive, even for him.His power is on a whole different level. He broke through the extremity and transcendence. But he might not have much time left.\u2018Time? What are you talking about?\u2019\u2026Without responding, Wrath stared at Glenn.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon turned his eyes to Glenn once more. After slowly looking around at the children and their parents, Glenn walked up on the platform and sat on the chair Rimmer usually sat on.\u201cEek?\u201dRimmer, who was entering over the wall, opened his mouth wide upon seeing him.\u201cWhy is my lord here\u2026?\u201dGlenn glared at Rimmer, unsatisfied about something.\u201cThis is an event selecting the family\u2019s future. Why shouldn\u2019t I be here?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I guess you\u2019re welcome here.\u201dRimmer jumped over the wall while smiling awkwardly. Bowing to Glenn, he trotted up on the platform.\u201cI wanted to take my time. Since my lord is here, I can\u2019t do that anymore. Let\u2019s start the trainee selection test immediately.\u201dScratching the back of his head, he instructed the parents to move back. The parents told their children to do their best and moved away.\u201cRaon.\u201dRaon turned back at Sylvia calling him.\u201cDon\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201cYoung master, please don\u2019t strain yourself.\u201dInstead of telling him to do his best, Sylvia and Helen worried about him and left.They are so weak, not suitable for you.Raon nodded. They\u2019ve never wanted him to be excellent, and all they wanted was for him to stay healthy.\u2018I still can\u2019t get used to it.\u2019His trainers in his previous life had only wanted results. The stark difference between them made it difficult for him to get used to.He turned his head back after staring at the two of them walking away, and Rimmer was grinning at him.\u201cThen everyone, the details of the trainee selection test that everyone has been curious about will be revealed.\u201dRimmer shook his hand from the platform. His expression was as light as always, but the small pressure emanating from him expanded its colossal wings.Wham!Albeit weaker than Glenn Zieghart\u2019s, the powerful pressure surrounding the entire training ground made the parents frown, and the children shrink down.Tap!With light yet majestic steps, Rimmer walked towards the center of the training ground.\u201cPierce through my pressure.\u201dLooking down on the children in front of him, a chill light radiated from his eyes.\u201cThat is my test.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m evaluating such an important ability, so why are you complaining so much?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong. Pressure was the harmony between the spirit and expertise of a warrior. A powerful pressure could often make the enemies lose their will to fight, without actually fighting.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since the children learned aura. Testing pressure is unreasonable.\u201d\u201cAnd some children didn\u2019t even learn aura.\u201d\u201cThe test is completely unfair!\u201d\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t aware of it. Pressure isn\u2019t just a manifestation of aura.\u201dRimmer swung his long finger left and right.\u201cTrue pressure is the combination of a warrior\u2019s achievements. It\u2019s a warrior\u2019s testimony, which can be manifested without an aura.\u201dA chill and rusty wind surrounded the training ground alongside his firm voice.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. Rimmer had just expanded his pressure without using aura, as if he were proving what he was saying.\u201cIf you still want to complain, then ask the head of house.\u201dRimmer turned around. Smirking, as if he had never been serious, he bowed to Glenn.\u201cMy esteemed lord, is a warrior\u2019s pressure created from aura?\u201d\u2018Hah.\u2019Raon huffed. Rimmer was really an unexpected man, or elf, for him to suddenly involve the head of house.\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong. Even those who never learned aura end up developing pressure, depending on how they\u2019ve been living.\u201d\u201cWow! As expected of my lord!\u201dRimmer turned around and clapped his hands.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn.\u201d\u201cIf my lord says so\u2026\u201dSince Glenn himself had said it, nobody could question it any longer\u2014direct line and collateral alike.That pointy-eared bastard just said something to my liking for the first time ever. Pressures created from something like mana, demonic energy or aura are all fake. A pressure stemming from the achievements of the soul is the only real one.Wrath nodded in agreement.It reminds me of back in the days in devildom. When insignificant demons started to run rampant, the King of Essence used a mighty pressure to make those fakes surrender\u2026 ugh!Since it looked like he was going to keep talking, Raon tapped his bracelet.\u201cFor the past six months, thanks to my detailed training, the children kept surpassing their limits\u2026\u201d\u201cStop lying.\u2019Karoon Zieghart, the second son of Glenn\u2014and Burren\u2019s father\u2014stood up while glaring at him.\u201cThere are many witnesses of your lying down napping during the regular training sessions. Did you even train them properly?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it as well, that he\u2019d only show up without giving them any attention.\u201d\u201cI heard he\u2019d always sleep and let the children train on their own!\u201d\u201cOh, you are well aware.\u201dRimmer didn\u2019t panic. He nodded instead, complimenting their intelligence capabilities.\u201cThat\u2019s also part of my training.\u201d\u201cHow was that training?\u201d\u201cWhich one do you think will result in more achievement? Doing their best on their own accord? Or doing their best following someone else\u2019s instruction?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obviously the former.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. What I wanted from the children was that willpower. Stamina and skills can be taught, but improving willpower is difficult. I wanted to select the children with the best willpower and train them.\u201dRimmer\u2019s voice was the same as always, but his words were filled with wisdom.\u201cThe children who surpassed their limits on their own managed to develop their own expertise, which will help them tremendously in the future.\u201dThe others couldn\u2019t protest his confident voice anymore.Their eyes shone with the expectation of their children\u2019s growth as they followed such training.\u201cSince everyone understands, let\u2019s start the test\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to ask one last question.\u201dKaroon didn\u2019t withdraw. His eyes were still filled with distrust.\u201cDespite having received the same training, the expertise of the children are on different levels. How are you planning to evaluate that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to check how much they have grown compared to their temperament at the beginning of the training. And the temporary trainee that has grown the most will be first place.\u201d\u201cDoes \u2018beginning\u2019 mean six months ago? Are you implying that you remember the temperaments of all one hundred sixty children?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d have to quit being an instructor if I couldn\u2019t even remember that.\u201dRimmer grinned, and Karoon\u2019s expression stiffened even more.\u201cWell, now that every troublemaker\u2014I mean, every parent is convinced, let\u2019s begin. Runaan, stand in front of me. The rest of you stay back.\u201dRunaan nodded lightly and stood in front of Rimmer, while other children stepped away.\u201cRunaan Sullion. The pressure I\u2019ll be emitting is on the level that you can withstand if you\u2019ve been doing your best.\u201dSmiling lightly, Rimmer continued.\u201cYou pass if you touch me through my pressure.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRunaan quietly responded and nodded.\u201cThen, I\u2019m starting.\u201dRimmer closed his eyes, then opened them. As a green light sparked from his eyes, a powerful pressure emerged.Rumble!The oppressive pressure that suddenly emerged crushed Runaan\u2019s composure.\u201cUgh!\u201dBiting her lip, she curled up like a shrimp.\u201cYou fail if you use aura. Use the willpower that you\u2019ve been using to withstand your training until now.\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dGetting rid of the aura she was about to use, she stepped forward. Cold sweat rained down her forehead, but she took step after a step, while enduring it until the end.Tap.Slowly but precisely, Runaan extended her hand and grabbed Rimmer\u2019s sleeve.\u201cYou easily passed. I can see that you have been doing your best.\u201dRimmer grinned, and patted Runaan\u2019s head.\u201cHaah!\u201dExhaling violently, Runaan stepped to the side.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNext is Dorian.\u201d\u201cAh, me? Already? Is it really my turn?\u201dDorian, who was hiding behind Raon, trembled as he peeked out. He kept anxiously fiddling with his belly pocket.\u201cWh-what\u2019s up with this order\u2026\u201d\u201cI made it. Come out already.\u201d\u201cSniff!\u201dDorian walked up with tears in his eyes. He looked like he was going to a slaughterhouse.He started to retch again.\u201cYou saw what Runaan did. Pierce through my wall of pressure using the willpower you\u2019ve accumulated through training.\u201d\u201cCa-can I do it? Everyone knows I have no willpower\u2026\u201d\u201cYou fail if you can\u2019t.\u201dRimmer expanded his second pressure. It was clearly weaker than the one towards Runaan, confirming that he was going to adjust his pressure to the trainee.\u201cUhee!\u201dMaking a weird noise like a racoon, Dorian stepped back.\u201cYou fail if you step back any further.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to give you one last piece of advice. You are scared easily, but you\u2019ve always been serious about your training. Trust yourself and walk forth.\u201d\u201cA-alright.\u201dDorian closed his mouth hearing Rimmer\u2019s calm voice. Then he slowly stepped forward.He faltered like a baby walking for the first time, but he didn\u2019t fall. Slowly but surely, he moved forward and extended his hand.Tap.Dorian\u2019s hand reached Rimmer\u2019s waist.\u201cYou pass. You lack confidence compared to your capability. From now on, be more\u2026\u201d\u201cKueh!\u201dSadly, Dorian was too busy vomiting, so he couldn\u2019t listen.\u201cHmm, let\u2019s continue.\u201dRimmer immediately designated the next person.***By the time the sun started setting in the western sky, most of the children had finished their tests.There were a decent number of children who managed to pass, but several times more of them failed and started to cry.It was interesting that most of the children that were stimulated by Raon and trained next to him managed to pass.However, more than half of those who trained their sword or fist while following Burren failed.As the test continued, Burren\u2019s expression stiffened. His turn finally came with only Raon left after him.\u201cBurren Zieghart. Come forth.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBurren walked heavily up to Rimmer. His frown was obvious to anyone\u2019s eyes.\u2018But of course.\u2019Raon snickered. His pride must have been hurt because half of his training partners failed.\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201dWith a smile, Rimmer expanded his pressure. The pressure, similar to what Runaan had withstood, became a green wind and crushed against Burren.Wham!Burren bit his lip until it bled, facing the tornado of pressure.\u2018D-did she really walk through this?\u2019Facing the pressure was completely different from watching from the sidelines.Runaan was just a coward that gave up on competing with him. He couldn\u2019t believe she managed to pierce through the pressure.\u201cKuh!\u201dHis feet didn\u2019t move, no matter how much he steeled himself. It was too difficult.\u2018Maybe he is making it more difficult for me?\u2019As doubt surfaced, he looked back at his father. But he was just standing there with a stiff expression, which meant that there was nothing wrong with the test.\u201cYour talent is special. Among the one hundred sixty talented trainees, those who can catch up to you can be counted on one hand. However.\u201dRimmer smiled and continued.\u201cYou wasted your time, along with those that followed you. You should\u2019ve trained your stamina and willpower, instead of practicing swordsmanship that you don\u2019t fully understand the meaning of.\u201d\u201cKuh!\u201dBurren grit his teeth and walked forward. He instinctively started pulling out the aura in his energy center.\u201cYou\u2019ve always used your aura whenever you faced difficulty. You will fail as soon as you use that aura.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I won\u2019t use it.\u201dForcing down the emerging aura, he stepped forward. Each step felt as painful as walking on lava.\u2018Huff!\u2019He could feel a cold gaze from behind him. It was his father\u2019s.\u2018I will be abandoned if I don\u2019t hold out\u2026\u2019He remembered his two older brother\u2019s faces when they were abandoned because they weren\u2019t to the father\u2019s liking. He couldn\u2019t become a loser like them.\u201cArghhh!\u201dBurren stepped forward\u2014no, he almost crawled forward with an ugly expression and voice, one that someone from the direct line shouldn\u2019t show. With all his desperation, he managed to grab Rimmer\u2019s clothes.\u201cYou pass.\u201dRimmer snickered and erased his pressure.\u201cHuaa!\u201dBurren kept exhaling violently, lying down on the ground. It was an appearance he had never shown before.\u201cYou are still twelve years old. Stop pretending to be an adult and train like the child you are. If you keep looking up while walking, stepping on a twig will make you trip.\u201dRimmer gave his advice to Burren, then turned his head. The smile on his face widened.\u201cAnd lastly, Raon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRaon stepped forward.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201dRimmer\u2019s pressure exploded. A pressure more powerful than the one directed at Runaan and Burren became a storm crushing Raon.\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cYoung master Raon!\u201dSylvia and Helen\u2019s cries could be heard from behind.\u201cAre you sure this is my test?\u201dRaon frowned. When he had first entered the training ground, his expertise was way lower than the middle-lower tier children, let alone Runaan or Burren. Taking that into account, Rimmer\u2019s pressure was far too powerful.\u201cI wonder?\u201dRimmer shrugged and continued.\u201cThe talent I saw in you is better than Runaan or Burren. Try withstanding this.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dRed flame ignited in Raon\u2019s eyes, engulfed by green wind.\u201cThen I shall meet your expectations.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayStep.Raon took a step forward. The more he approached Rimmer, the stronger his pressure became.Not just the other children, it was difficult for even Burren or Runaan to pierce through such pressure. Yet, Raon could only laugh.\u2018He\u2019s setting it up for me.\u2019He didn\u2019t need to hide his abilities now that he had decided to live as Raon Zieghart.The stage to show off his talent was set, his abilities had opened, so he only needed to play his part on the stage.\u201cHow is it? Tell me if it\u2019s too difficult\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dRaon smiled lightly and moved his feet.\u2018It\u2019s too much for my current expertise.\u2019Expertise followed the soul, not the body. That\u2019s why Raon didn\u2019t only have the expertise of Raon Zieghart, but also that of the greatest assassin Raon.Woosh!On top of Raon Zieghart\u2019s small yet sturdy pressure, the expertise of the assassin Raon, who had never failed before, stood at attention.Step.The sound of his footsteps walking on the training ground\u2019s sand changed. Raon\u2019s expertise, carried on his shoulder, expressed its serene intent.Rip!Pressure as sharp as a blade ripped Rimmer\u2019s green wind pressure in half.\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201dRimmer glared. Panic appeared in his green eyes, which had always been easy going.Whir!Raon walked forward without responding. Cutting through the turbulent wind, he took five steps, and stood in front of Rimmer.Tap.He casually extended his hand and tapped Rimmer\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIs the test over?\u201d\u201cEh? Yes\u2026\u201dTo his confident yet composed voice, Rimmer just nodded.\u201cThank you.\u201dLowering his hand, he erased the expertise of the assassin that he had called. It looked like he had strained himself, as his mind was in a daze.\u201c\u2026\u201dRimmer\u2019s mouth was still open wide, unable to hide his surprise.You! What the hell are you?Wrath\u2019s voice also sounded surprised. It was rare for him to show any emotion other than anger.\u201cHmm.\u201dWhile waiting for Rimmer\u2019s reaction, Raon looked around the silent training ground.The children from vassal families and collaterals that had jeered at him, the children who had trained with him and were rooting for him, and even the parents remained silent.\u201cWh-what? He pierced it? That brat?\u201d\u201cNo, just how did this\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe is just a patient that hasn\u2019t even learned aura! It\u2019s impossible!\u201dThe trainees\u2019 parents muttered with blank expressions.\u201cRaon! How is your body?\u201d\u201cYoung master, you must have strained yourself.\u201dSylvia and Helen teared up. They looked impressed, but their words spoke only of worry for his body.However, Glenn Zieghart\u2019s expressions didn\u2019t change. He looked as cold as always, as if a layer of ice covered his face.\u2018That one\u2019s a real deal.\u2019Raon shook his head, looking at Glenn.***\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201dRimmer expressed his amazement looking at the calm Raon.\u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me for the six last months. I am Raon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking you because you surpassed it. I emitted a pressure that you couldn\u2019t withstand with your current ability. It was just a joke, and I didn\u2019t even imagine that you would pierce through it.\u201dIn order to discover the ability that Raon had been hiding, he gave off a pressure too powerful for him to withstand.He was certain that Raon couldn\u2019t pierce it, no matter how much power he had been hiding, yet Raon single handedly ripped through his pressure. Honestly, he still couldn\u2019t believe what had happened.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer took a glance at people behind Raon.\u2018Well, I do like that.\u2019Their noisy mouths were shut tight, just like his own. The entirety of the training ground was at a loss because of what Raon had just done.\u201cAhem. I was a bit distracted, despite being the head instructor.\u201dRimmer went back to the platform, riding the green wind.\u201cWith Raon Zieghart as the last participant, the selection test for official trainees has ended. However, one more important event remains.\u201dEveryone\u2019s gaze was focused on him as he mentioned an important event.\u201cIt is the announcement of the first place trainee, the representative of the trainees.\u201dSince there was a high chance that the first place trainee would become the family\u2019s head, greed dwelled in everyone\u2019s eyes\u2014children and parents alike.\u2018It went according to the plan, but the situation is different from expected.\u2019It was actually decided that first place would go to Raon Zieghart. He had shown the most progress as a temporary trainee, so it fit the test\u2019s purpose. Although, he didn\u2019t expect him to pass so easily.\u2018Thanks to that, the accident that I\u2019d prepared for might not happen.\u2019Rimmer snickered and glanced through the trainees. Looking past Runaan and Burren, his eyes stopped on Raon.\u201cRaon Zieghart. From today onward, you are the top trainee of the fifth training ground. Please do your best in the future.\u201d\u201cOh! Young master Raon!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDorian clapped his hands, and Runaan clapped exactly three times, a strange expression on her face.\u201cY-young master Raon is the top trainee!\u201d\u201cAww\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Sylvia!\u201dHelen grabbed his head, and hugged Sylvia who was falling down.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cRe-really?\u201d\u201cThat child is really in first place? I can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201d\u201cRaon was the one who withstood the most powerful pressure.\u201d\u201cBut he is Sylvia\u2019s son! The runaway Sylvia!\u201d\u201cThat has no relation to the child\u2019s abilities.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t that a scam that Rimmer had planned all along? He definitely could\u2019ve done it!\u201dThe others started arguing, claiming that it was unbelievable.\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s a lie!\u201dBurren stood up with trembling lips.\u201cThis can\u2019t be!\u201d\u201cWhat is a lie, and what can\u2019t be?\u201dRimmer looked back at Burren, uninterested.\u201cRaon is worse than me in terms of stamina, strength, and talent! I can\u2019t accept such a person getting first place!\u201d\u201cYou saw it, too. Raon easily broke through pressure way more powerful than the one you barely managed to pass. He deserves first place.\u201d\u201cHe must have used a trick!\u201d\u201cBurren Zieghart, are you doubting my decision?\u201dRimmer\u2019s smile remained the same, but the atmosphere changed. It felt like a sharpness was added to the cool wind.\u201cTh-that\u2019s not what I mean! I\u2019m saying that he cheated! Raon couldn\u2019t even follow me yesterday, so it makes no sense that he pierced through such a powerful pressure!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cEven the instructor couldn\u2019t believe it, right?\u201dThe collaterals that followed Burren stood next to him.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer scratched his chin. He certainly didn\u2019t expect Raon to pierce through his pressure so easily, so he could understand their claim.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cHow can he do that when he is suffering from the Curse of Frost?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have aura.\u201dWhen he looked around, not only the children but also the adults were mumbling. They started to doubt the test, despite having seen it with their own eyes.\u201cWell, I do understand your doubts. I was surprised as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dBurren\u2019s eyes opened wide at the glimpse of hope.\u201cWe are a family of warriors, Zieghart. A duel should determine the first place, rather than a test like this!\u201d\u201cDo you want the first place so much that you are suggesting a duel against Raon?\u201d\u201cI mean, a duel with anyone. It doesn\u2019t have to be me\u2026\u201d\u201cYour eyes are full of desire; you don\u2019t need to lie.\u201dRimmer snickered and waved his hand. Burren blushed like an apple, but he didn\u2019t refute it.\u201cBut the test is already over. My lord, what shall we do with this situation?\u201d\u201cBurren Zieghart.\u201dGlenn looked between Raon and Burren, then slowly opened his mouth.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou need to pay the price if you want to change the verdict. Are you sure you are ready for it?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dBurren immediately answered without giving it a thought. He was confident he would win against Raon, no matter what.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dThis time, Glenn called Raon\u2019s name.\u201cYes.\u201dRaon saluted.\u201cThe others cannot accept the result. Do you have any intention of competing with Burren?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon firmly shook his head.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cEeeh\u2026\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 Is he crazy!\u201dSince nobody expected him to immediately refuse, everyone\u2019s jaws dropped.\u201cThe test is over, and the results are out. Without gaining anything in return, there is no reason for me to compete.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cAfter you blabbered about the direct line, honor, and matters like that, I didn\u2019t expect that you wouldn\u2019t even accept the results.\u201d\u201cKuh!\u201dBurren\u2019s flush darkened as he heard Raon\u2019s sarcasm.\u201cThen do it like this.\u201dEveryone looked at Glenn, whose voice sounded like a lump of iron was pressing down on it.\u201cDuel with the title of first place on the line. If you win, I\u2019ll issue you a bronze tablet.\u201d\u2018Bronze tablet!\u2019Zieghart issued gold, silver, or bronze tablets, depending on their accomplishments. Despite it being just a bronze tablet, one issued directly by the head of house would earn him some decent rewards.\u2018That\u2019s an unexpected piece of good luck.\u2019He\u2019d already won the bet with Wrath by ending up with first place, and now Glenn would give him a bronze tablet. His reward had just doubled.It looked like Glenn wished for Burren, from the direct line, to tag first place. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t going to satisfy him.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cRa-Raon!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dAs soon as he nodded, Sylvia ran up to him. He smiled at his worrying mother.\u201cThank you for trusting me! My lord, I won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201dBurren bowed to Glenn, overwhelmed by his emotions.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, now begin the duel.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSpringing to his feet, Burren walked up to Raon.\u201cTo be facing me in a duel, your luck ends here.\u201dHe continued while grinning.\u201cI didn\u2019t like you from the very first time I saw you. I will show you the difference between the direct line and an abandoned insect.\u201d\u201cWow. The boy who couldn\u2019t accept the results talks so much.\u2019Raon snickered and turned his wrist.\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cSave the fight for the duel.\u201dRimmer stood between them, shaking his head.\u201cThe duel will be one round. You are disqualified if you use a weapon or aura. Fight with nothing but your body.\u2019\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201dRimmer raised the hand that was blocking Raon and Burren\u2019s vision of each other and stepped back.\u201cBegin!\u201d\u201cHaap!\u201dBefore the word \u2018begin\u2019 could reach his ears, Burren dashed. He thrust his fist sharply at Raon\u2019s solar plexus.Tap!Raon turned the back of his hand to fend off his fist. The fist\u2019s fierce rotation numbed his wrist.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough to stop my fist!\u201dBurren laughed coldly and thrust his fist a second time, this time at his stomach.Pow!He fended off the blow with his hand, but the impact sent pain up his forearm.\u201cThis is the Void Tiger Fist that my father taught me personally. There was no rule against using a fist technique, so this isn\u2019t against the rules.\u201d\u201cVoid Tiger Fist\u2026\u201dVoid Tiger Fist was Zieghart\u2019s fist technique, consisting in rotating a fist to break through the enemy\u2019s defense.\u2018What shall I do\u2026?\u2019It was powerful, but sloppy. He could easily beat him down.\u2018It would be a waste to simply win.\u2019Since the stage was set, he wanted to use the opportunity to prove his ability to everyone.\u201cWhere are you looking?!\u201dBurren swung his fist. Leaning back, he avoided fist and stepped backward.\u201cThis is the difference in talent!\u201dHe kept swinging his fist while using a stepping technique. Both his fist and steps were sloppy, but he was somewhat threatening thanks to his excellent physical abilities.\u2018Talent, huh?\u2019Raon stepped sideways with glittering eyes. He considered the way to best deliver a blow to the idiots of Zieghart, who thought only of talent.Martial arts study.As expected of members of a military family, they consider a talent in martial arts study the most valuable.\u2018And I have something great.\u2019Raon used his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 at full force. The moment the three rings began to rotate furiously, Burren\u2019s movement became slower, and the flow of his fist technique could be seen.\u201cDid you give up?\u201dBurren thrusted his fist straight. A brutal wind brushed past his ear.\u201cOf course not.\u201dRaon\u2019s hand moved in a half moon shape. Burren\u2019s fist bounced back upon touching that rotation.It was the same rotation as his Void Tiger Fist, but the direction was reversed.\u201cEek!\u201dBurren\u2019s expression wavered as he bounced back. But he grit his teeth and dashed at him again.Tap!Fending off his fist, Raon pushed him with his shoulder. With a slam, Burren stepped back.Pow!Raon kicked the ground and dashed into the panicking Burren\u2019s chest.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dDespite being in panic, he tried hitting his chin with his left fist. However, Raon had already finished analyzing his fist technique.Pow!Rotating in the other direction, he pushed Burren\u2019s fist back and struck at his stomach.\u201cKugh!\u201dBurren knelt, foaming at the mouth.\u201cHow\u2026 how are you using the Void Tiger Fist\u2026?\u201dHe drooled, mouth wide open at the unexpectedness of the situation.\u201cWh-what happened just now?\u201d\u201cHow did he use the Void Tiger Fist\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way Sylvia or Rimmer would\u2019ve taught him that!\u201d\u201cWhat just happened\u2026?\u201dEveryone watching the duel widened their eyes in astonishment.\u201cYou just showed me.\u201dRaon dusted off his hands, looking down on Burren coldly.\u201cI just copied your fist technique.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHah\u2026\u201dRimmer reflexively covered his mouth with his hand, but he couldn\u2019t hide his wide-open mouth.\u2018What\u2019s this now?\u2019The duel between Raon and Burren was something he had originally planned.He expected that Burren would object when Raon took first place, which would be solved with their duel.Rimmer wanted to teach the overconfident Burren a lesson, and display Raon\u2019s excellence to everyone.However, Raon had changed everything.In fact, the outline was the same, but the details were too shocking.Instead of using his strength, agility, and skill to defeat Burren, he sent him flying using the essence of Void Tiger Art.\u2018This doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026\u2019Despite not using any aura, Burren\u2019s Void Tiger Art was by no means weak, thanks to his talent.However, Raon saw through the flow of Burren\u2019s fist and reversed its flow right back at him.If a drunkard claimed a child that had never learned martial arts was capable of such a thing, he would\u2019ve been slapped across the face for spouting such nonsense.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer swallowed and looked around. Just like him, everyone around them was shocked as they stared blankly at them.\u2018Even the head of house is surprised.\u2019Glenn, who had been as expressionless as a statue, was now frowning in surprise.\u201cRaon.\u201dRimmer swallowed again and approached Raon.\u201cYes, instructor?\u201d\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201dThere were many meanings to that simple question. He was asking whether he really copied the Void Tiger First from watching it, or if he learned it from somebody, or if it was a completely different technique.\u201cI saw the rotation of Burren\u2019s fist. It was spiraling like a tornado.\u201dThat was true, since the Void Tiger Fist\u2019s particularity is the spiral rotation.\u201cThe rotation was fast enough to push back my defense, hand and fist alike. So, I figured I shouldn\u2019t keep fighting normally.\u201dRimmer nodded. He\u2019d planned the duel because he wanted to see how he would overcome that, so he obviously realized that.\u201cSince I\u2019m confident in my stamina, I considered running around. But as I watched Burren\u2019s fist, I could feel something.\u201d\u201cYou could feel?\u201d\u201cYes. The flow created by his fist was clearly visible. It somehow felt like I could do the same thing, so I reversed the rotation to cancel out Burren\u2019s.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dRimmer unconsciously exclaimed.\u2018This guy is the real deal!\u2019His heart pounded like a drum. Someone capable of understanding the flow of a martial art just by observing was clearly a genius.However, Raon was even more excellent.He managed to use the opponent\u2019s flow as if it were his own. It was an endless talent that he had never seen before.\u201cBullshit!\u201dBurren\u2019s father\u2014Glenn\u2019s second son\u2014Karoon Zieghart stood up. Dark flame was burning in his eyes.\u201cNo matter how sloppy Burren is, it\u2019s not humanly possible to understand the Void Tiger Fist at a glance!\u201d\u201cBut he did.\u201dRimmer shrugged, pointing at Raon.\u201cHe must have learned it from peeping at Burren\u2019s training! That, or he was taught by someone else!\u201dKaroon\u2019s savage gaze turned towards Sylvia and Raon.\u201cWell, I\u2019m too lazy to teach something like that, and who would\u2019ve bothered going to the annex building to teach him the Void Tiger Fist? It doesn\u2019t really make any sense. And Burren isn\u2019t the type of person to let others steal his technique.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe notably grimaced. He looked like he wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t, as Glenn was watching.\u201cSo, is there anyone else who wants to challenge Raon?\u201dRimmer raised his head, looking at the children. No one raised their hand after what had just happened.\u201cRunaan?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRunaan shook her head. She went next to Raon and started to copy the reversed Void Tiger Fist that he had performed.\u201cHup.\u201dRimmer smirked and turned away. The situation was different from his expectations, but the end result was way better.\u201cRaon, it\u2019s your victory.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRimmer smiled and Raon bowed lightly.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to thank me for, it was all you. As for issuing the bronze tablet, the head of house will take care of it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dRimmer glanced through Raon as he responded. He was double checking, just to be sure, and Raon certainly did not have any aura.\u2018This is so ridiculous.\u2019He sighed and turned around.\u201cMy lord, the event is over.\u201dGlenn nodded, then stood up. After briefly looking around the children\u2014including Raon, Burren, and Runaan\u2014he left the training ground.\u201cHe could\u2019ve given a piece of advice before he left.\u201dRimmer licked his lips and called out to the children.\u201cThose who\u2019ve passed shall return here next Monday, after resting for the rest of the week. Those who failed shouldn\u2019t be too disappointed, as there will be another chance for you. Now, dismissed! Have a nice time with your family.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands and left the training ground by jumping over the wall.\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cYoung master Raon!\u201dAs soon as he left, Sylvia and Helen ran up to Raon and hugged him.\u201cWh-what happened while you were gone?!\u201d\u201cYoung master, are you hurt anywhere?\u201dThe two were the same as always. They didn\u2019t ask how he did what he did, instead worrying about his body over and over.\u201cI\u2019m completely fine.\u201dRaon smiled and shook his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go back home now. I miss eating stew!\u201d\u201cStew? A-alright! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll return first and prepare it!\u201dHelen trotted out of the training ground, and Raon followed her while holding Sylvia\u2019s hand.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat the hell happened during the last six months?\u201d\u201cRaon Zieghart\u2026\u201d\u201cI never thought that kind of talent existed\u2026\u201dThe people remaining at the training ground just stared at Raon and Sylvia\u2019s backs with blank expressions.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dNo one was paying attention to Burren, who was just staring at the ground, biting his lip until it bled.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *At the border of the training ground\u2019s exterior wall, on top of a wall so thin that it could barely fit a bird, five people\u2014men and women alike\u2014stood watching the scene below.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dThe long-haired man sitting in the first row spoke up.\u201cHe is a genius. There\u2019s nothing else to say.\u201d\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t fake, then he must be more talented than him.\u201d\u201cCopying after reading the flow, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe four people replied honestly with their impressions.\u201cWe came to watch Runaan and Burren, but that was so worth it.\u201dEveryone nodded in agreement.\u201cAs you know, the Red Cloud has suffered many losses recently. You can have Burren or Runaan, and I\u2019ll take Raon\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you wanna die?\u201d\u201cYou will shamelessly take that endless talent with you!?\u2019\u201cThink before you speak, if you don\u2019t want to shed blood.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe atmosphere suddenly turned chilly. The four people looked like they were about to draw their swords.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m joking. It\u2019s a joke.\u2019The long-haired man shook his hand with a hollow smile.\u201cAnyway, that child will bring about many changes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe four people stood in silent agreement as they watched Raon leave the training ground.The core of Zieghart\u2019s military power were the different divisions, and they had noticed Raon.***Rimmer followed Glenn into the lord\u2019s manor after entrusting the aftermath to the instructors.\u201cWhy did you test them yourself, despite getting weaker and weaker?\u201dGlenn frowned, sitting on the throne.\u201cI\u2019m still the head instructor, so I should do my job.\u201d\u201cSir Rimmer.\u201dThe butler, Roenn, handed him a cup of tea.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Roenn.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dRoenn looked older on the outside, but Rimmer was actually way older than him, so Rimmer spoke casually to him.\u201cWhat were you even thinking?\u201dGlenn asked, supporting his chin with the golden armrest.\u201cWhy did you create a match between Raon and Burren?\u201d\u201cWell, it just happened\u2026\u201d\u201cIt just happened? Despite it going exactly as you\u2019d planned?\u201d\u201cWow, I really can\u2019t fool my lord!\u201dRimmer awkwardly scratched the back of his head.\u201cBurren\u2019s talent is exceptional, but he is narrow minded. Raon has a special something, but it is unknown. I wanted them to have a match to benefit them both.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAs you\u2019ve seen, ice still prevails over Raon\u2019s body. However, his willpower alone is comparable to an accomplished warrior.\u201d\u201cI already know that.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s one thing you didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t either.\u201dRimmer lifted his index finger and continued.\u201cIt\u2019s that he is a genius. I wanted to see his willpower. I looked forward to seeing how he dealt with Burren, who has already learned powerful martial arts.\u201dRimmer\u2019s eyes shone like stars in the sky.\u201cBut what he showed us this time wasn\u2019t his willpower, but talent. And an endless talent at that! He managed to counterattack using a flow he understood at a glance! Does that even make sense? I have been on countless battlefields, yet this is my first time seeing such talent!\u201d\u201cA bum said something like that before. That a child born with Curse of Frost also has exceptional talent.\u201d\u201cBy bum, do you mean the Ragged Saint?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGlenn nodded and continued.\u201cThey either have an exceptional talent in ice magic or aura or end up becoming a great beauty.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201dRimmer stomped the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s the manifestation of that talent! He was born with an absolute talent in martial arts!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cBurren, Runaan, and your other grandsons and granddaughters are also special, but Raon is even more so. He has the disposition of someone who can become the continent\u2019s absolute best!\u201dDespite Rimmer\u2019s excitement, Glenn\u2019s expression remained composed.\u201cIt was my first time seeing anything like that. I\u2019m sure the division leaders have never seen such a talent before, either.\u201dRoenn, who watched the duel along with Glenn, exclaimed his surprise.\u201cWe must train him perfectly. Raon got a bronze tablet, but if we reward him with something better than a silver tablet\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201dGlenn firmly shook his head.\u201cI ended up rewarding him because of your silly plan, but it would be unreasonable to increase the reward.\u201d\u201cEek! But\u2026\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t favor him either. Treat everyone equally.\u201d\u201cYou are really heartless\u2026 ugh!\u201dGlenn glared at him coldly, making Rimmer flinch and close his mouth.\u201cAnyway, Raon is the real deal. He shouldn\u2019t just be protected because of his weak body, but he should be properly trained instead. He is probably better than your second grandson, who is called a genius only seen every hundred years, or the first offspring of the Sullion family. You must consider this.\u201d\u201cYou are speaking a lot.\u201d\u201cBecause I saw the real deal.\u201d\u201cRegardless, there won\u2019t be any special attention unless he contributes to the family\u2019s fame.\u201d\u201cHuh. He should be given the best elixir or cultivation technique, at least, to help him ease the ice\u2026\u201dRimmer closed his mouth when Glenn raised his hand.\u201cThe bum said that it\u2019s not a good idea to use more fire-attribute elixir. He said Raon needs to overcome it himself.\u2019\u201cWow! You pretended to be uninterested in him, yet you looked into it already!\u201d\u201cNonsense. He loves to talk, so he just kept babbling.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dRimmer and Roenn stared at him mischievously.\u201cAnyways.\u201dGlenn clicked his tongue and flicked his finger. Along with a golden flame, the metal door leading to the Zieghart\u2019s treasury appeared behind him.\u201cI\u2019m going to organize the treasury, so you should leave.\u201dGlenn spoke before he entered the treasury.Rimmer and Roenn, who were left in the lord\u2019s manner, looked at each other and grinned. He certainly didn\u2019t go there to organize out of nowhere.\u201cHe really isn\u2019t honest.\u201d***Raon returned to the annex building and spent time with Sylvia.He didn\u2019t talk a lot, but because there were many things Sylvia was curious about, the conversation kept going.They only returned to their respective rooms after talking for over six hours.\u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019Raon sighed as he closed the door. Time spent with Sylvia was comfortable, but it was also more exhausting than training.Ahem. Finally, a satisfying meal after such a long time. From now on, you should eat here every day.Wrath wasn\u2019t angry for once. It looked like he was satisfied with the annex building\u2019s food and dessert.The meals at the training ground were like dog food. I can\u2019t even stand the sight of it anymore.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but we have to keep eating it.\u201dSince he\u2019d become an official trainee, he had to stay there for years.Damn it!Wrath ground his teeth. He was a parasitic demon king that wanted tasty food. It was ridiculous.Anyway, I had something to ask you.\u201cAsk me?\u201dRaon Zieghart, who the hell are you?Wrath, who was hanging on his wrist, returned to his blue flame form.The King of Essence has seen countless humans, and also lived as a human for hundreds of years. However, the King of Essence has never seen anyone like you.Wrath\u2019s flame burned up explosively. It was even more fierce than the first time they\u2019d met.The King of Essence could feel it. You are hiding something special. Now tell me your true identity\u2026\u201cHey, Wrath.\u201dA mere human shouldn\u2019t dare call the King of Essence by name!\u201cThere\u2019s something more important than my identity or your name.\u201dWhat\u2026\u201cYour memory is worse than I thought.\u201dThe corners of Raon\u2019s lips lifted as he looked down on Wrath.\u201cOur bet is over. Stop saying silly things and give me my reward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot about it.\u201dRaon tapped Wrath, who was floating on his shoulder.The King of Essence is the monarch of wrath, who rules over devildom.Icy blue air radiated from Wrath. It was a bone-chilling cold.The King of Essence has not lied once since it came to existence.The King of Essence and you are bound by a contract called \u2018bet\u2019. The rewards will be given, even if you don\u2019t want it. So don\u2019t worry about it.\u201cThen give them to me already.\u201dI\u2019m asking you one thing before that.\u201cWhat?\u201dHow did you pierce through the pointy-eared bastard\u2019s pressure, and how did you copy that arrogant guy\u2019s martial art?Wrath\u2019s question was exactly what Raon had expected.\u201cGive me the rewards first.\u201dHmm\u2026 Alright.Once Wrath\u2019s blue flame fluttered like a butterfly, messages appeared in the air.You have won the bet against <Wrath>.The rewards are being distributed.All stats have increased by 2.Raon bit his lip in ecstasy as the increase in stats washed over his body. However, there were still more rewards.A random trait of <Wrath> is being generated.The <Perception of Snow Flower (One-Star)> has been generated.\u201cPerception of Snow Flower?\u201dRaon tilted his head as he looked at the trait\u2019s name.A trait too good for your insignificance has been chosen.\u201cWhat does it do?\u201dIt\u2019s an ability that increases the range of your perception. Since it is one-star, it will increase the range by about ten percent.\u201cTen percent\u2026\u201dIf Raon could perceive ten meters around him, then it would become eleven meters with that trait.It didn\u2019t look like much, but if the range of his perception increased, then the trait\u2019s use would increase accordingly.The King of Essence could perceive ten times more than his original perception.\u201cI see.\u201dWhen he thought about it, the <Perception of Frozen Flower> also had (One-Star) attached to it. That signified that the trait was going to develop, just like the trait \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good.\u201dRaon nodded. As an assassin, perception had been more important than power. As such, he was satisfied with a trait increasing his perception range.\u201cBut why is it called \u2018Perception of the Snow Flower\u2019?\u201dIt\u2019s my personal taste. Just respect it.\u201cHuh.\u201dThe frozen flower bracelet was his taste, and now the name of \u2018Perception of the Snow Flower\u2019 was also his taste. His taste really sucked.Since the bet with the King of Essence is over\u2026As Wrath was about to approach him, a new message appeared.You have achieved your first victory in a bet with <Wrath>.The title <First Victory> has been created.The title\u2019s effect has increased all stats by 1.\u201cEh?\u201dDamn!Despite being unable to see the status window, Wrath could see the messages. His jaw dropped.You damn rat! How dare you steal the King of Essence\u2019s stats once again!\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, your system did it on its own. Also, isn\u2019t one point nothing compared to your main body\u2019s abilities?\u201dOf\u2026 of course!\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dThat\u2019s true, but\u2026Wrath awkwardly rolled his eyes, then sighed.Haa, alright. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s your turn now. Tell me your identity.\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201dWhat? What did you just say\u2026?!\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dRaon shook his head with a straight face.Are you mocking the King of Essence? You said you would reveal your identity\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything like that. I only asked you to give me my rewards first.\u201dEh\u2026Wrath\u2019s jaw dropped as he recalled exactly what happened.\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? I never told you I would answer.\u201dRaon slightly smiled.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t tell him about the reincarnation.\u2019In order to explain how he used the expertise of the assassin Raon, he would have to tell him about the reincarnation. Since he couldn\u2019t predict what Wrath would do, he couldn\u2019t let him know about his reincarnation.\u2018Same goes for the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2019On top of protecting and developing the mind and body, the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 also had the special ability of identifying the flow of martial arts.That included other people\u2019s martial arts, on top of his own. That\u2019s why he was capable of copying Burren\u2019s Void Tiger Fist during their duel.Of course, it was only possible because Burren\u2019s achievement in the Void Tiger Fist was lower than his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, which was enhanced by the status window.Anyway, Raon had no intention of giving any information to Wrath to begin with.\u2018Because he is an enemy.\u2019They had gotten a bit closer, but Wrath was still aiming for his body and soul. He couldn\u2019t give him any information, no matter how small it was.You made a fool of the King of Essence!Wrath couldn\u2019t hold back his anger anymore and radiated icy flames. Raon felt the pain of tens of thousands of ice knives piercing his skin.\u2018But I can endure it.\u2019It was a relief that he met Wrath after obtaining \u2018Water Resistance\u2019. If he didn\u2019t have \u2018Water Resistance\u2019, or if Wrath\u2019s affinity was fire, then he would\u2019ve lost already.Suppressing Wrath\u2019s coldness, which was filling his heart with emotion, Raon smiled.\u201cYou never learn. Attacking me when nothing else is happening will only result in your loss.\u201dShut up!Wrath\u2019s flame became even more fierce. The cold penetrated his bones, and his limbs started to tremble.Whap!The ice in his mana circuit was activated by the excessive external stimulation, making it extremely painful.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dInhaling slowly, Raon used his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019. The pain began to subside.What a brute! How are you even withstanding it?!\u201cWillpower.\u201dHe casually responded, though his insides weren\u2019t the same.It was difficult to hold on, despite having the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Water Resistance\u2019. If he didn\u2019t have the experience from his previous life, where he went through all that hellish training, he would\u2019ve fainted already.Gritting his teeth, he endured it with everything he had. At that moment, a blue window appeared in front of his eyes.You have displayed extreme willpower in facing <Wrath>\u2019s attack.Agility and Stamina have increased by 1.When the messages announcing an increase in stats appeared, Raon\u2019s mind and body were filled with vitality. The ice pressing down on his mana circuit also started to subside.Damn it!Wrath cursed and left his body. His anger was the same, but he realized he was hurting himself by doing that.Just who the hell are you?! The King of Essence has never witnessed a human like you, not in the entire history of humanity.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, either.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a joke.Why was he reincarnated? Why was he born as a Zieghart, and why was he paired with Wrath? He didn\u2019t have the answer to any of those questions.Don\u2019t underestimate the king of Essence, who will reveal your identity at all costs and consume your body and soul!\u201cAs I keep saying\u2014do it, if you can.\u201dRaon smiled and sat on the bed. The goose that laid the golden egg did an excellent job, once again.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes, directed out the window, wavered coldly.\u201cI wonder what that is.\u201d***Inside the Central Martial Palace, where Karoon Zieghart dwelled, a room that looked like the definition of splendor was completely silent.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBurren Zieghart, who had been standing straight for almost four hours, started to groan.Karoon, who was sitting at the desk, finally looked at him.\u201cBurren Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSince Burren hadn\u2019t spoken for hours, his voice was hoarse.\u201cWhat was my command?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026 It was to become the top trainee. A-and you also asked me to not lose to anyone!\u201d\u201cCorrect. I wasn\u2019t asking much. I just wanted you to get first place, after winning against the girl from the Sullion family and trampling over Raon.\u201dKaroon\u2019s eyes burned red in anger.\u201cAnd yet\u2026 Not only that girl, you also lost to the son of the insect that dropped out of the direct line! In front of everyone, at that!\u201dThe low and cold voice resonating throughout the room made him feel like his heart was being crushed.\u201cHow much will you disgrace me? Do you want to become like the third or the fourth?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all!\u201dBurren kept shaking his head, trembling. He didn\u2019t want to become like his two older brothers, who weren\u2019t even mentioned by name anymore.\u201cYou\u2019ve already lost your first chance.\u201dKaroon\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t contain any hint of delight at seeing his son after such a long time. Only anger and irritation existed.\u201cI\u2026 I am aware.\u201dBurren couldn\u2019t meet his intimidating gaze, biting his lip as he looked at his feet.\u201cThe top trainee will be chosen again once basic training is over, upon trainee graduation. Bring me that title.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dBurren swallowed and responded as if he was spitting blood.\u201cIf you want to live as a part of the direct line of Zieghart, don\u2019t waste your last chance.\u201dKaroon waved his hand, signaling him to get out.\u201cTh-thank you.\u201dBurren couldn\u2019t even look at his father\u2019s face properly, despite not seeing him for six months. He left the room while lowering his head.\u201cDamn it!\u201dAfter leaving the Central Martial Palace, Burren punched the wall while screaming.\u201cIt\u2019s because of that bastard\u2026\u201dHe gritted his teeth. Since he was used to being complimented, his father\u2019s admonition affected him even more.And the fact that a mere insect like Raon was the cause of all of it made him even angrier.\u201cHaa!\u201dHe sighed, trying to get rid of the irritation filling his heart, but he didn\u2019t feel any better. Trying to refresh himself, he started to wander aimlessly.\u201cWhy am I here\u2026?\u201dWhen he came to, he had arrived at the fifth training ground. The door was closed, so he went over the wall.\u201cIt\u2019s as expected.\u201dBurren sneered. Despite the entrance door being closed, the doors to the indoor gymnasium and locker room were all still open.\u201cStupid instructors.\u201dHe curled his lips and headed to the locker room. When he was about to close the door, he noticed the locker with Raon\u2019s name on it.\u201cHmm.\u201dMurmuring that he was only going to look, he opened Raon\u2019s locker. It was neat inside. There was nothing except a box at the bottom of the locker.\u2018Why is there a box here\u2026 huh?\u201dBurren\u2019s jaw dropped as he looked inside it.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Wh-what\u2019s with this number of shoes?!\u2019The box contained training shoes with the bases either worn out or torn off. And there weren\u2019t only a few of them, but over ten pairs of them.\u2018He did this in six months?\u2019He examined the shoes in disbelief, but they all had the same shape and size. They were all Raon\u2019s shoes.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dBurren gasped. He was also supplied with training shoes, just like Raon. But he had only replaced them twice.\u2018How does this make any sense?\u2019The fact that Raon had replaced his shoes more than ten times, while he had only replaced them twice, was difficult to believe.\u201cThis is crazy\u2026\u201dLooking at the shoes, which looked like they had been worn for several years, he felt like he had been hit over the head with a club. The shock was much greater than when he was scolded by his father.\u2018I feel like I just woke up from a dream.\u2019Once his head cleared, he remembered the facts that he\u2019d been trying to ignore.The fact that Raon arrived at the training ground earlier than anyone and returned later than everyone.The fact that he never gave up training, despite sweating heavily and breathing frigid air from his mouth.The fact that he kept running alone in the training ground after night fell, after his stamina training in the indoor gymnasium.\u2018While I\u2019ve been superficially swinging my sword and resting in the dormitory, he\u2019s been surpassing his limit every day\u2026\u2019That was the reason that Raon\u2019s spirit was better than any other temporary trainee\u2026\u2018This is how a real Zieghart should be.\u2019Among everyone in the fifth training ground, the one who was the most suited to being a warrior of Zieghart was Raon.\u2018On the other hand, I\u2026\u2019He scorned and mocked him, and without being able to accept the results of the test, he disgracefully lost to him\u201cKuh!\u201dHis face grew red in embarrassment. He hated himself for all the dirty and disgraceful acts he had done, blinded by his envy.After sitting in the locker room for a while, he lifted his head. His green eyes were brimming with determination, unlike when he entered the training ground.\u201cNever again\u2026\u201dWhat had already happened couldn\u2019t be changed. Not repeating the same mistakes was the important part. That was what a Zieghart should do, and what he was going to do from that moment on.\u201cHaa!\u201dBreathing out deeply, he got rid of his selfishness. His steps as he left the training ground were as light as Rimmer\u2019s.***Two days after he returned to the annex building, Raon\u2019s routine was the same as when he was at the training ground.From daybreak, he started running around the annex building, and he trained his strength without any equipment after breakfast.Since he spent his time with Sylvia the day before, there was only one being that would bother him.Are you training again? It\u2019s boring. Perform some cute tricks for the King of Essence.Ignoring the whining Wrath, Raon was about to keep training. Before he could, someone came to visit him.\u201cI am Roenn, the head butler of the lord\u2019s manor.\u201dHe was a kind looking old man, with half his hair dyed the color of a cloud.\u201cThe head of house has summoned the young master.\u201dHe bowed respectfully.\u201cDid you say summon? Why me\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s to award you with a bronze tablet.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon frowned. He\u2019d thought the tablet was just going to be delivered, but he was personally summoned instead.\u201cHuff!\u201dSylvia, who was inside the building, ran over to the window.\u201cS-sir Roenn.\u201d\u201cLady Sylvia.\u201dSince they obviously knew each other, they bowed at the same time.\u201cFa\u2014I mean, did the head of house personally summon him?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cBy any chance\u2026?\u201d\u201cNothing bad will happen. It\u2019s just an awarding ceremony, after all.\u201dRoenn smiled kindly to ease her worries.\u201cRaon\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be back.\u201dRaon dusted off his clothes and put on his outer garment.\u201cWait! Change before you go!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine like this.\u201dGlenn was inherently a warrior. He wasn\u2019t going to dislike him for coming in the middle of his training.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dRoenn smiled and walked ahead. Raon gestured to Sylvia with his eyes and made his way to the lord\u2019s manor.***\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s hands trembled as he looked at Glenn, sitting on his golden throne.Meeting his eyes alone, in the audience chamber large enough to fit hundreds of people, made his mouth dry.Is he bragging about being slightly stronger? I want to stab his red eyes.Of course, the crazy Wrath was different.\u201cI shall keep my promise, whether I like it or not.\u201dSaying such an unnecessary thing, Glenn gestured at Roenn.\u201cYes.\u201dRoenn slightly nodded and brought the bronze tablet shining faintly.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon accepted the bronze tablet from Roenn. The Zieghart\u2019s emblem, a burning sword, was engraved on the middle of it.\u201cI\u2019m awarding you with this bronze tablet. By returning the bronze tablet, you can ask for an equivalent object or request.\u201d\u201cThen, can I do that now?\u201dRaon looked up to Glenn, holding his tablet. He\u2019d already decided how he was going to use the tablet.\u201c\u2026 State your will.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Glenn nodded.\u201cSylvia Zieghart.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHow can I return my mother to her original position?\u201dSince they didn\u2019t expect him to say that, both Roenn and Glenn looked down at Roan with wide eyes.\u201cBy original position\u2026 Are you implying her position in the direct line?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGlenn closed his mouth. He surveyed him from head to toe, trying to figure out his intentions. Raon felt like his heart was being crushed, just from his gaze alone.\u201cAccomplishments.\u201d\u201cBy accomplishments, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you achieve an accomplishment that the entire family will acknowledge, then it is not an impossible feat.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re implying that it can be done.\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dGlenn nodded. He continued with a slightly brighter expression than before.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s almost impossible. Being acknowledged by multiple people is more difficult than plucking a star from the sky.\u201dHe lifted the corner of his lips, as if he were mocking him. It looked like he was certain that Raon couldn\u2019t achieve it.Insolence! If the King of Essence had his main body back, he could kill him in a few thousand bouts!Wrath glared at Glenn with burning eyes. However, a few thousand bouts meant that he was a powerful opponent, one that would be difficult for Wrath to manage.\u201cThen I don\u2019t need it.\u201dRaon gave the bronze tablet back to Roenn.\u201cThank you.\u201dGetting accomplishments was something he\u2019d done as often as breathing in his previous life. Resolving that he would return Sylvia to her original position, no matter what mission he had to accomplish, he stood up.\u201cWait.\u201dWhen he was about to return, Glenn\u2019s voice could be heard from above the platform.\u201cYou didn\u2019t state your requested reward yet.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou only asked a question. That is something that can be answered without a tablet.\u201dWhen Raon turned back, Glenn was looking at him with the same cold eyes. However, something unspeakable seemed to have changed.\u2018What is it?\u2019He\u2019d never thought Glenn would say such a thing. Since he\u2019d thought Glenn would take the tablet back no matter what, it was rather unexpected.\u201cState your wish.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes shone, looking at the bronze tablet that Roenn was holding.\u2018The next wish is already decided too.\u2019He\u2019d already thought of what he needed the most, after the question about Sylvia\u2019s restoration.\u2018The aura cultivation technique.\u2019The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was certainly an eternal cultivation technique, but it only trained his body and soul. It was unable to create an aura.He needed an aura cultivation technique, one that was better than the shadow aura cultivation technique he had learned in his previous life.\u201cI need an aura cultivation technique.\u201d\u201cAura cultivation technique? The instructors will teach you that during basic training.\u201dIt was true. The cultivation technique taught during basic training was better than average among the continent.However, it wasn\u2019t enough.In order to restore Sylvia\u2019s position, and cut off Derus\u2019 head, he needed a better cultivation technique.\u201cI need a better aura cultivation technique. I want you to bestow me with one equivalent to the bronze tablet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGlenn closed his eyes. Raon kept thinking it, but Glenn was less expressive with his emotions than he was, and he had been an assassin. His nickname of cold-blooded really did suit him well.Snap!When he flicked his fingers, his eyes still closed, the floor of the lord\u2019s manor began to tremble.Rumble!Golden flame appeared from the ground. From the spiral flame, a circular bookshelf soared upward endlessly.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes widened. The bookshelf was enormous enough to reach the audience chamber\u2019s high ceiling, and books of assorted colors and shapes were placed between each divider.\u201cThis is one of Zieghart\u2019s bookshelves. If you put your hand at the center, the book you need the most right now will come out.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I see.\u201dRaon calmed himself down and approached the bookshelf. It was so tall that looking up at it made his neck hurt, and there were so many books that they could be called countless.\u2018I just need something better than the shadow aura cultivation technique.\u2019He put his hand on the bookshelf, wishing for a better aura cultivation technique than the shadow oneRumble!The bookshelf vibrated and the books trembled as if they were cold.The bookshelf rotated for a bit, then stopped.Pang!The first book from the first partition, which couldn\u2019t even be seen properly, flew out and opened.Whap!It emitted a golden light so bright that he couldn\u2019t even open his eyes.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201dGlenn Zieghart, who was watching the scene, suddenly stood up\u2014breaking the armrest of the throne in the process.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22\u201cWhat is this book\u2026?\u201dRaon swallowed, looking at the burning book. Despite being so worn out that it looked like it would crumble into pieces, it was gleaming with a magnificent golden light, brightening up the audience chamber.Whir!Like a flower petal announcing the end of summer, the book drifted down and touched Raon\u2019s fingertip. Despite being on fire, it wasn\u2019t hot. Instead, it held the warmth of a human\u2019s body temperature.\u2018\u2019Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation?\u201dReading the words on the cover, he tried to open the book. At that moment, the pages started turning on their own and the book started to burn more fiercely.Shatter.Once it reached the final page, the book turned to ash. They scattered, like used firewood.\u201cHuh?\u201dRaon tried to grab the disappearing book, but it was pointless. The paper was reduced to powder, and the flame was extinguished into nothing but smoke.\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019As he stood there, unable to comprehend the situation, a message appeared.[Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation. You have faced an eternal flame.][You remember the Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation.]As soon as the message finished, his head started to throb as if thunder had struck it.\u2018Hup!\u2019It felt like someone had thrust a huge needle into his brain. His knees faltered from a pain greater than that caused by Wrath\u2019s mental attack.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dThankfully, the pain faded quickly, and he managed to avoid falling.\u201cYoung master!\u201dRoenn, who was next to him, came to support him.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201dThanking him, he put strength into his wobbling legs.What did you just do?\u2018I don\u2019t know, either. But\u2026\u2019He remembered. He could recall the contents of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019, which had been reduced to powder and disappeared.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dHe raised his head to the owner of the slightly trembling voice. Glenn was staring at him with wide eyes. It was an expression that he\u2019d never seen before.Raon couldn\u2019t tell if he looked angry or flustered.\u201cWhat have you just done?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either. But I remember the contents of the cultivation technique that disappeared from my hand.\u201d\u201cWhat was the name of the book?\u201d\u201cIt was \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing Raon\u2019s response, Glenn closed his eyes. After standing as motionlessly as a statue for a while, he opened his eyes. He didn\u2019t look flustered anymore.\u201cDid you say you remember the content?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s fine.\u201dGlenn waved his hand with his usual cold-hearted expression.\u201cYou\u2019ve received the reward for returning the bronze tablet. You should leave now.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon glanced at Roenn. He looked bewildered, but quickly changed into his usual smiling face.\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201dRaon nodded and stepped backward to leave the audience chamber. Glenn and Roenn stayed immobile until he left completely.\u201cSigh.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand what had just happened.\u2018Did the system grant my mind the ability to memorize the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019?\u2019The system increases your memory and thought processing ability, but it can\u2019t force knowledge into your brain.Wrath\u2019s voice also sounded puzzled.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019Walking through the corridor in the lord\u2019s manor, he mentally skimmed through the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.He realized it immediately.The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was a cultivation technique far more profound and meticulous than the \u2018Shadow Aura Cultivation\u2019 technique.\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2019The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 didn\u2019t only contain an aura cultivation technique, but also a swordsmanship technique and information about the ancient world.If he learned the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 technique engraved in his memory properly, he would reach a level beyond that of his previous life.\u2018But why did he give this to me?\u2019The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was too valuable to be exchanged for a mere bronze tablet.Nevermind a silver tablet, a gold tablet wasn't even enough for it! He couldn\u2019t understand why Glenn had given it to him.Why are you worrying so much when you\u2019ve already received it?\u2018That\u2019s true.\u2019There was no way someone like Glenn would make him return whatever he gave out, and he couldn\u2019t return it if he asked, anyway.\u2018Let\u2019s go back.\u2019Since he\u2019d only obtained the knowledge, he wanted to return and start cultivating immediately.Raon started running towards the annex building as soon as he left the lord\u2019s manor. His eyes were filled with excitement as he ran at full speed.***The audience chamber was filled with heavy silence after Raon had left.\u201cMy\u2026 My lord. Was the cultivation technique that the young master Raon received\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. It was used by that person.\u201dGlenn nodded, looking at the empty space on the first partition of the bookshelf.\u2018For him to take the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019\u2026\u2019In the history of Zieghart, no one had managed to take out nor read the first clan leader\u2019s cultivation technique. That technique was the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 that Raon had just received.Glenn had brought out the first bookshelf to grant him a cultivation technique equivalent to a silver tablet, instead of a bronze tablet. He\u2019d never imagined that he would take the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Gulp.Roenn swallowed hard, looking at the ashes that were all that remained of the book containing the cultivation technique.\u201cIf this matter becomes known, young master Raon and Lady Sylvia might be in danger!\u201d\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry. No one knows about the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.\u201dGlenn shook his head. The existence of \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was only known to those who\u2019d already become the head of house. Unless they thoroughly investigated the family\u2019s history, there was no way anyone would know about it.\u201cHmm\u2026 Then, what about the book having completely disappeared\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine too, since it has been handed down to another person.\u201dRaon said he remembered the content of the cultivation book. It was a mysterious phenomenon, but everything would be fine as long as it was handed down.\u201cBut the \u2018Ten Thousand Cultivation\u2019 technique is passed down to the Zieghart\u2019s head of house\u2026\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be used, anyway. If it wasn\u2019t for that child, it would\u2019ve ended up rotting away.\u201dHe was actually surprised.No, to be more precise, he was awestruck. However, since it was Raon who manifested a golden flame during the Judgment Ceremony, he felt that Raon was its rightful owner.\u201cSince he obtained the first head\u2019s cultivation technique, the young master Raon will become more powerful than anyone else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dGlenn slowly shook his head.\u201cTalent and how hard you study martial arts are both important to become strong. However, the most important aspect is the kind of person he is. No matter how powerful the martial art one studies, they cannot surpass a strong human.\u201dThe reason that Glenn kept organizing the Judgment Ceremony, even after surpassing the demonic wall, was to give adequate advice to talented children.Glenn wasn\u2019t judging children\u2019s futures simply by their talents.\u201cI beg your pardon. I was so surprised that I made a mistake.\u201dRoenn nodded, placing his hand over his chest. Glenn was always saying that the person is more important than the talent, ever since he\u2019d reached a new level of martial arts.Although, others in the family only cared about talent and the study of martial arts.\u201cChange is coming.\u201dGlenn pressed against the back of his throne.The \u2018Ten Thousand Cultivation\u2019, which had never allowed itself to be handed down, and the golden flame that had appeared only once in the history of the family\u2026 Raon had them both.\u2018Raon Zieghart.\u2019Glenn couldn\u2019t openly love him, despite Raon being his grandson. And yet, that child was about to bring many changes to the family.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun watching him.\u201dIf time allowed. Glenn closed his eyes, swallowing those words.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon entered his room as soon as he returned. He had told everyone to not enter his room, but he\u2019d locked the door just in case.So paranoid.\u2018You should know, too. I might die if I get distracted while cultivating aura.\u2019It was fine after a certain level had been reached. However, if someone touched him before his cultivation stabilized, it could cause big trouble.That was the reason that he didn\u2019t cultivate the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 until he went to sleep in his personal bed when he was younger.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t distract me, either.\u201dHmph!\u201cAre you planning to\u2026\u201dOnly once.A smile showed up from the blue flame.\u201cOnce?\u201dThe King of Essence will interrupt you only once while you are doing that cultivation, or whatever.\u201cThat could cause my body to become disabled before you can take it over.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter.A scornful laugh, similar to a beast\u2019s growl, could be heard from Wrath.You won\u2019t be able to overcome it, but the King of Essence can revive a body even if its limbs are cut off and the energy center decimated.Wrath\u2019s evil voice sent chills down his spine.The moment you become disabled and give up on everything is going to be the King of Essence\u2019s opportunity.\u2018As I expected, you are\u2026\u2019Raon realized it once again.Wrath wasn\u2019t an ally. He was a demon from devildom, and the incarnation of wrath, ready to eat away his mind and body whenever he got the chance.\u201cSo, are you only doing it once?\u201dYou already know that the King of Essence doesn\u2019t lie. I will only interrupt you once before you finish learning that cultivation technique.\u201cI have no choice, then.\u201dRaon rubbed his wrist. Wrath wasn\u2019t going to listen even if he told him not to, so he had no choice but to accept it.Tremble in fear every day. You won\u2019t know when the King of Essence will start to attack.Wrath\u2019s voice was overly excited. He sounded overjoyed by his ability to tease him for once.\u2018That\u2019s such a small thing to be happy about as a king.\u2019It was funny that he was so happy about such a trivial matter when he kept childishly referring to himself as the King of Essence and took pride in being a monarch of devildom and the king of wrath.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Wrath\u2019s interruption was going to be dangerous, despite it only happening once.The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was a cultivation technique that absorbed nature's mana and accumulated aura in the energy field. If he were interrupted at an important moment, his mana circuit or energy field could break.It would disable him.And it was especially dangerous for Raon, with all the ice in his mana circuit.\u2018But I cannot falter.\u2019Considering Wrath\u2019s personality, he was going to push more strongly if he noticed any weakness. No matter the result, he had to stay strong.\u201cAlright. Try it, then.\u201dHiding his thoughts, Raon showed a relaxed smile.Let\u2019s see how long you can keep up that arrogant expression.\u201cYou will have to see for the rest of your life.\u201d\u2026 I want to break your mind right now.\u201cTry it. That sounds like free stats to me.\u201dDamn insect. Still wet behind the ears\u2026 Doesn\u2019t lose a single argument.\u201cThis insect is always open, so come at me any time.\u201dKuh!Raon sat on the bed, waving his hand dismissively. Wrath screamed, exploding in anger, but he was completely ignored.\u2018If he has a brain at all, he isn\u2019t going to interfere right away.\u2019Breathing slowly, Raon closed his eyes. Inhaling nature's mana, he filled his body with fresh air. He then exhaled the murky air from his mana circuit.\u2018There are similarities.\u2019The flow of \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 and \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 shared similarities, as their names suggested.Thinking positively, Raon settled the inhaled mana inside his mana circuit.The flow of \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 started from his right wrist. It was an energy as fierce as fire and as haughty as water, all at the same time.Whir!The heated mana ran through his body. The ice remaining in his mana circuit was swept away by that majestic flow.\u2018I can\u2019t miss this, either.\u2019It would\u2019ve been a waste to throw away the pure ice, so he brought it up to his energy center along with the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Whir.Upon reaching the energy center, the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 scattered in vain.\u2018I guess that\u2019s normal.\u2019Acquiring the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 in one single attempt would\u2019ve been unnatural.Once using the flow of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 felt like breathing to him, the flow would naturally accumulate in his energy center.\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2019He was absorbing the ice from his mana circuit, on top of the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019. That meant that his \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 was going to grow quickly, as well.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dExhaling the heated air after finishing one rotation, Raon opened his eyes.Fire attribute, huh?\u201cHaving only one attribute is a drawback, but it\u2019s an excellent cultivation technique.\u201dYou say foolish things sometimes.\u201cWhat?\u201dThat\u2019s the problem with those who don\u2019t learn the attribute properly. A single attribute that is properly mastered isn\u2019t any weaker than a well-rounded user. Back in devildom, the story of the King of Essence freezing an entire castle with icy air was spread throughout history\u2026\u201cHmm.\u201dIgnoring Wrath as he started to brag about his past, he focused on what he said before.\u2018A properly mastered single attribute.\u2019He was correct.Someone who sloppily learned a single attribute was considered half-qualified, but upon reaching a certain level, they were considered as an absolute being.He could tell from cultivating only once.The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was special. It didn\u2019t lose at all to the legendary \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018I have to learn it properly.\u2019Deciding that he would dedicate everything to learning the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 for a while, he stood up.\u201cBefore that.\u201dAre you taking care of it now?\u201cYes. It\u2019s not a coincidence that they are visiting us every day.\u201dRaon\u2019s red eyes glowed like those of a death god.It was time to take care of business.***Judiel was a new maid, one who had started working in the annex building one month before.Thanks to her good impression, cheerful personality, and efficient work, she quickly became trusted by the residents of the annex building.However, after finishing the daily chores she told people that she was going to rest. Instead, she climbed the trees in the garden to spy into Raon\u2019s room.\u2018He\u2019s talking to himself again.\u2019Judiel narrowed her eyes, watching Raon mumbling to himself. It wasn\u2019t often, but he sometimes talked to himself and stared into thin air.She\u2019d heard that he had always been sick, so she thought that was the reason.When Raon stopped talking to the air and sat down with his eyes closed, the flow of mana around him suddenly changed.He had meditated like that many times before, but it was the first time that the mana started to swirl around him.\u2018As expected, he learned an aura cultivation technique from the lord\u2019s manor.\u2019It looked like Raon had used his bronze tablet to learn an aura cultivation technique. The flow of mana was extremely fierce, meaning it was a pretty powerful cultivation technique.\u2018This has to be reported.\u2019Judiel climbed down the tree after Raon opened his eyes and turned the light off in his room.She went to the small lake at the end of the garden and took out the paper and pencil hidden underground. She wrote down everything Raon had done and everything she managed to learn since she had entered the annex building.Mysteriously, the letters on the paper disappeared as soon as she wrote them, and it looked like nothing was ever written on it.\u201cThis is such a depressing job.\u201dJudiel sighed. In order to survive, she was reporting information about a child that could be used against him, and it was making her feel empty.\u201cBut it has to be done.\u201dThe bitterness only lasted for a moment. As long as she had something to protect, she had no choice in the matter. That fact filled her empty heart.Tap.Judiel folded the paper to the size of a thumbnail and set afloat on the lake. The paper was going to reach Karoon Zieghart by the next morning.\u201cThen I shall return\u2026 ah!\u201dShe suddenly stopped as she rose. The cold feeling of steel touching the back of her neck sent her heart pounding.\u201cYou will die if you open your mouth.\u201dAs she was looking around in a panic, a cold voice came from behind her.\u201cYou will die if you move.\u201dHer hair stood on end at the sound of the voice, which seemed to containing death.\u201cLower your eyes and look at the lake.\u201dFollowing the voice\u2019s instruction, she lowered her eyes and looked at the lake.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaon Zieghart\u2019s red eyes were floating above the dark lake, reflecting the night sky.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Gulp.Judiel swallowed harshly.\u2018Why? Why is that boy here\u2026?\u2019She couldn\u2019t understand why Raon Zieghart, who should\u2019ve been sleeping, was standing behind her with a sword pointed in her direction.\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019She wanted to try and grasp the situation, but she couldn\u2019t even breathe\u2014let alone try to think\u2014when she saw the red eyes reflected in the lake.She felt like her heart was being crushed, as if she was meeting the eyes of a murderer that had taken hundreds and thousands of lives.\u201cI know someone has been observing me since the day I returned to the annex building.\u201d\u201cHup\u2026\u201dSince the day he returned\u2026 That meant that he\u2019d noticed her gaze from the very beginning.\u2018No. No way.\u2019She had been trained as a spy since childhood. That was why she was confident in her ability to hide her presence better than anyone else.There was no way a mere child had discovered her identity and caught her off guard.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s words weren't a suggestion, but an order. Judiel trembled and opened her mouth.\u201cGuk\u2026\u201dHis finger pushed past her parted lips and forced something down her throat.\u201cKyah!\u201dShe screamed. A pain\u2014like an awl piercing her esophagus and stomach\u2014shot through her.She sniffled. Her stomach felt like she had just swallowed flames, to a point that she felt the urge to peel away her belly.Splash.Leaving Judiel, who was writhing in pain, Raon entered the lake and brought back the dark blue paper.Rustle.Raon\u2019s eyes darkened as he unfolded the paper.\u201cThis isn\u2019t normal paper.\u201d\u201cHup\u2026\u201dJudiel shut her mouth. Despite the agonizing pain, she wasn\u2019t going to yield. Her pride as a spy wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon Zieghart nodded after staring into her eyes for a while.\u201cWater. Earth. Fire. Wind.\u201dHe suddenly started naming the different elements. He appeared to be looking for a way to investigate the paper\u2019s content, but she couldn\u2019t understand why he was speaking aloud.\u201c\u2026 Sunlight. Moonlight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe answer was moonlight, but Judiel didn\u2019t react. Biting her tongue, she endured the stomach-rending pain.\u201cSo, it was moonlight.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dShe felt like her heart was jumping out of her mouth. Raon Zieghart had said the correct answer immediately after meeting her eyes.\u2018Wh-what?! How?\u2019She was just enduring the pain. How was he able to determine the secret of the paper, despite her refusal to show any reaction?He turned the paper over and placed it under the light from the moon for a while, then began to read.\u201cThis is a very thorough investigation. Who were you going to send this to?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRaon asked his question with a blank expression. Judiel was now more scared than agonized. The strangling fear was hurting her back.\u201cAries Zieghart.\u201dHe didn\u2019t press her for an answer. Instead, he said the name of Glenn Zieghart\u2019s first daughter.\u201cKaroon Zieghart, Denier\u2026 It was Karoon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dJudiel started shouting, unable to hold back anymore.\u201cWho\u2026 Who are you?!\u201dHer chin trembled in fear of the unknown.\u2018Wh-what is this child?!\u2019Managing one's expressions and endurance were the first things taught to a spy.It was impossible for a mere child to discern information just from looking into her eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon Zieghart kept gazing down at her without saying anything. Judiel bowed down, trying to avoid his menacing glare, and came to a realization.\u2018Wait! What if he wasn\u2019t reading my expression?\u2019His eyes weren\u2019t checking her expression. He was just calmly looking at her.\u2018No way\u2026\u2019The agonizing pain ripping through her stomach\u2026 The way Raon was reading her thoughts\u2026 The connection between the two snapped in place in her thoughts.\u201cDid\u2026 Did you feed me a rage worm?\u201d\u201cYou know about rage worms?\u201dRaon Zieghart\u2019s expression changed for the first time. He was jeering at her, at the way she knew about it, despite being a mere spy. But that was enough of an answer.\u201cKuh!\u201dShe felt like throwing up.\u2018No way\u2026 A rage worm!\u2019Rage worm was one of the worst curses in the world. By making it enter the body of a target, the caster could discern not only the target\u2019s location, but also their thoughts.The worst part was the fact that, no matter how far away they were, the caster could kill the target whenever they wanted\u2014accompanied with agonizing pain.\u2018That\u2019s the only possibility. It\u2019s a rage worm!\u2019The agonizing pain, and the way Raon Zieghart was reading her mind, made her realize that what entered through her mouth was certainly a rage worm.\u201cHow\u2026 How did you use a rage worm\u2026?\u201dShe doubted how a thirteen-years-old child that had been sick his entire life could use a rage worm, but that was the only possibility she could think of.\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be what\u2019s important to you right now.\u201dRaon Zieghart approached her, swaying the paper in front of her eyes.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHe was right. Since a rage worm had already entered her body, she couldn\u2019t run away or disobey.\u201cSince you sent this letter to Karoon Zieghart, you must be a spy from the Central Martial Palace. And the operation must have started seven months ago, after the Judgment Ceremony.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dJudiel\u2019s eyes widened. He was right once again. She had come to the annex building seven months ago, after the Judgment Ceremony. It confirmed, once again, that he had used a rage worm against her.\u201cYou have investigated very thoroughly. Not only about me, but also about my mother, Helen, and the other maids.\u201dRaon Zieghart smiled, looking at the letters shining under the moonlight. The bloodlust contained in his expression drenched Judiel\u2019s back in cold sweat.\u2018I\u2019ve offended somebody I never should have.\u2019She\u2019d thought it was an easy mission.The annex building didn\u2019t have any warriors, and only kind people lived in it. As she only needed to gather information about the young Raon and the disabled Sylvia, she thought it would be simple, easy.It wasn\u2019t.There was a monster living in the annex building, and it was an extremely murderous one. Looking into his red eyes made her want to hang herself.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dShe pulled at the flesh on her arm.The pale bloodlust coming from him made her feel like her face was getting torn apart, and the organ where the rage worm resided felt like it was going to explode.\u201cI\u2026 I will change the content. I\u2019ll deliver a false\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201dRaon Zieghart lowered the paper. The letters that used to reflect moonlight went invisible. After folding the paper once again, he set it afloat on the lake.\u201cWh-why\u2026?\u201d\u201cEven if you change the information now, Karoon will eventually learn about me. It will only result in him realizing your incompetence.\u201d\u201cHup!\u201dRaon knelt and met her eyes. Meeting his bloody red eyes, her hands and feet trembled.\u201cHow often do you report?\u201d\u201cThe periodical report is once every two weeks.\u201d\u201cSince I won against Burren today, the period will become shorter. It should change to one week.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dJudiel nodded. She\u2019d also thought the same thing.\u201cYou are a double agent from now on. Report him with any information that he will soon discover anyway, hide undisclosed and important information. On the other hand, bring me valuable information from his side.\u201d\u201cUn-understood.\u201dShe nodded unconditionally, since she could do anything to get out of her current terrifying situation.\u201cI'm looking forward to some useful information the next time I return.\u201dAfter saying that, he disappeared into the darkness.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHowever, Judiel still felt like his red eyes were glaring into her heart.Plop.Unable to stop her legs from trembling, she collapsed on the ground.\u201cThe\u2026 The pain\u2026\u201dThe pain had disappeared at some point. It looked like Raon Zieghart had controlled the rage worm.\u2018Monster\u2026\u2019She couldn\u2019t even think about disobeying him. There was an existence more terrifying than the death itself hiding in the darkness of the annex building.\u201cUgh!\u201dJudiel bit her lip and ran to her lodgings. The fear left behind by Raon was deeply engraved in her heart, like goosebumps sprouting on her neck.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *When did you summon a rage worm?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a rage worm.\u201dRaon, who had returned to his room, shook his head.What?\u201cI fed her with a poison, making her feel intense pain temporarily.\u201dHe\u2019d fallen victim to a rage worm in his previous life, but he couldn\u2019t even remember it. Obviously, he didn\u2019t know how to cast it. What he\u2019d fed Judiel was just a poison used for torture.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use something like a rage worm, even if I had it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t have any intention of using such a dreadful curse. If he\u2019d had the worm in front of him, he would\u2019ve crushed it under his feet.Then where did you get that poison?\u201cI made it.\u201dSo earlier, when you went to the kitchen and warehouse\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dPoison recipes were already in his memory, so he\u2019d just modified one a bit to make a poison using the materials he had around him.Wait. Earlier, you read her thoughts.\u201cYes, I did.\u201dHow could you do that without using a rage worm?\u201cSome of them were guesses, and others were from looking at her condition.\u201dHer condition? But didn\u2019t she maintain the same expression the entire time?Wrath\u2019s blue flame wavered. He couldn\u2019t seem to understand how he\u2019d gotten the information from looking at her condition.\u201cI can tell.\u201dHe\u2019d lived as an assassin for over twenty years in his previous life. He was also experienced with torture, so it wasn\u2019t really difficult for him to read Judiel\u2019s thoughts.Even in devildom, the King of Essence has never seen anything like a thirteen-year-old that knows how to engrave fear into people.He was right.If he didn\u2019t have the experience from his previous life as an assassin, he wouldn\u2019t have realized that Judiel was gathering information. He also couldn\u2019t have used the same method against her.When he thought about it, he realized his previous life was quite useful.\u201cAnyway, it was Karoon Zieghart.\u201dRaon repeated Karoon\u2019s name, sitting on his bed. He could guess the reason he\u2019d sent Judiel. He must have wanted to obtain information about him because of how he\u2019d acted at the Judgment Ceremony.But he made the incorrect decision.Just observing him was fine, but he also included Sylvia, Helen, and every maid in the annex building as the targets of his observation. That was the worst mistake he could\u2019ve made.But why didn\u2019t you change the information?Wrath approached while tilting his head.She\u2019d written that you managed to overcome the ice even more, and obtained an excellent aura cultivation technique. Shouldn\u2019t you have erased it?\u201cThat's trivial information. I need to give away that much if I want to trick him.\u201dBrushing his finger over the bedsheet, he continued.\u201cIf she keeps sending real information about me to the Central Martial Palace, she will become trusted. If I send false information after sending useless, but real, information\u2026 I can create an opportunity to dispose of Karoon Zieghart.\u201dHah\u2026Wrath gasped. He realized Raon really was abnormal to be able to make such a plan in such a short amount of time.You are obviously not thirteen years old. You are like a hundred-year-old python on the inside.\u201cJust a python?\u201dRaon swayed his finger with a mocking smile at Wrath.\u2018I\u2019m not a python. I\u2019m an assassin.\u2019The best assassin.***Runaan Sullion didn\u2019t stop training, not even after she returned home.She couldn\u2019t stay still, as she kept recalling the movements that Raon Zieghart had shown on the testing day.However\u2026\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201dWhen she trained with the equipment in the house, the weight she could lift had clearly gotten smaller compared to when she was at the training ground.It wasn\u2019t just the equipment. Long-distance running and other stamina training didn\u2019t go well, either.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dShe pondered about it, but there was only one answer.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dRaon wasn\u2019t there. Since Raon\u2014who always used to be next to her\u2014wasn\u2019t with her anymore, she wasn\u2019t in her usual condition.Since Raon\u2019s fragrance had gotten even better, she would sniff it unconsciously. She thought that was one of the reasons why.\u2018I need him.\u2019Runaan Sullion nodded and left the training ground.\u201cRunaan?\u201dRokan Sullion, the head of the Sullion family, furrowed his brow as he watched Runaan leave the training ground.\u201cWe were going to train together. Where are you going?\u201d\u201cTo Raon.\u201d\u201cRaon? Do\u2026 Do you mean Raon Zieghart?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cWh-why are you going to him? And why now, when we were supposed to train together?\u201dRokan Sullion stuttered, losing his usual composure. His hands trembled, because Runaan said she wanted to go to Raon when he finally managed to make time to play with his youngest daughter.\u201cBecause of the scent, and the training.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying.\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dRunaan dusted off her clothes and left the training ground.\u201cWa-wait! You can train here, with your father!\u201d\u201cI have to train there!\u201dRunan resolutely shook her head.\u201cYou keep saying that you have to go. D-Did Raon do something to you?\u201d\u201cSomething?\u201dShe blankly lowered her head and thought about what happened with Raon.\u2018He helped me.\u2019Raon hadn\u2019t directly helped her, but she could train more efficiently whenever she was next to him, so she was definitely assisted by him.\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\u201cKuh! Raon, that bastard!\u201dRokan grinded his teeth.\u2018How dare you threaten my daughter?!\u2019Rokan added his imagination to Runaan\u2019s short answer to draw a picture. The picture of his poor daughter, trembling in fear from Raon\u2019s threats, was embedded in his brain.\u201cOh, no! My lord! You can\u2019t be here! Today\u2019s tasks can\u2019t be postponed, no matter what\u2026\u201d\u201cBring my sword immediately!\u201dRokan shouted at the butler that came looking for him.\u201cEek? Sw-sword?\u201d\u201cRunaan, I\u2019m coming too! I can\u2019t let him be!\u201dRokan glared. He looked like he was going to destroy the Zieghart\u2019s annex building.\u201cHuh? Huh?\u201dThe butler opened his mouth wide. His head was hurting already because of the mess that he was going to create.\u201cWhat are you doing?! I told you to bring me my sword!\u201d\u201cPl-please, wait! My lord! Please talk to me\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to talk! I only need a sword and punishment!\u201d\u201cHaaah\u2026\u201dThe butler turned his head towards Runaan. She was staring at Rokan with a blank expression that made it impossible to know what she was thinking. He knew that the quiet lady wasn\u2019t going to resolve the situation.\u2018That person is the only one who can resolve this.\u2019He shook his head and went into the mansion to look for the madam, instead of a sword.***\u201cSo. You are saying that the young master Raon helped you with your training, rather than threatening you. Correct?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded at Clara\u2019s question.\u201cDear.\u201dClara\u2019s purple eyes glowed coldly as she turned to the left.\u201cNo, no. I obviously thought she was th-threatened. She only said she was going, so anyone would\u2019ve misunderstood. Yep! Anyone!\u201dRokan, who had been about to charge without thinking, was now crouching in a corner. He was bent nearly in half.\u201cStop talking and get back to work.\u201d\u201cNo, I was going to play with Runaan today\u2026\u201d\u201cHush.\u201d\u201cO-okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to come and check on you later, so you\u2019d better finish your work by then.\u201d\u201cYe-yes. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dRokan went back into the mansion, slumping in disappointment with that huge body of his.\u201cRunaan.\u201d\u201cMhm?\u201d\u201cDid you thank the young master Raon?\u201d\u201cI did when he gave me a cracker.\u201d\u201cHow about when he helped you with your training?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dRunaan shook her head and Clara smiled as she brushed her hair.\u201cThen tell him thank you the next time you see him.\u201d\u201cBut father\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cFather told me to not start talking to men.\u201d\u201cAha!\u201dClara smiled. The butler, who was looking at the smile, became certain that Rokan was going to be scolded the whole night.\u201cForget about what he said. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a man or a woman. It\u2019s a common courtesy to give thanks when you are helped. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cNow then. Do you wanna train with your mother today, instead of your father?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dReturning to the training ground with Clara, Runaan remembered Raon\u2019s calm face.\u2018I\u2019m going to say thank you.\u2019She was slightly flustered when she thought about talking to him first.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Raon opened his eyes, feeling the sunlight enter through the window.\u2018It\u2019s difficult.\u2019He skimped on sleep during his break to cultivate more, but he didn\u2019t manage to create an aura.\u2018This isn\u2019t a common cultivation method.\u2019He\u2019d felt it when he saw Glenn\u2019s expression and when he examined the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 engraved in his memory, but it definitely wasn\u2019t a martial technique that could be exchanged for a bronze tablet.Let alone a silver tablet, even dozens of golden tablets wouldn\u2019t have been enough.\u2018Why did he just give it to me?\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand why he gave him such an excellent aura cultivation method. After all, he thought Glenn hated him and Sylvia.The most surprising part was that he didn\u2019t do anything when the book was reduced to powder, and Raon was the only one able to have that knowledge.\u2018Is there a problem with this aura cultivation method?\u2019He thought Glenn had probably given it to him because it wasn\u2019t a complete cultivation method, or it had some kind of flaw somewhere.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe carefully checked the content of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 in his memory.\u2018I don\u2019t see any problems.\u2019He didn\u2019t notice anything in particular, but he thought he should be careful, just in case.That\u2019s not the only thing you should be careful about.Wrath suddenly burst from the ice flower bracelet.If you don\u2019t watch out for the King of Essence, your soul and body will be engulfed by wrath.\u201cSo be it.\u201dRaon nodded at Wrath, who was chuckling.That is an arrogance not even seen in devildom. I will definitely shut down your arrogance this time.\u201cI keep telling you. Do it if you can.\u201dRaon waved his hand dismissively and left the room. He couldn\u2019t show any weakness to Wrath. A serene mind. A mind as calm as the lake in the middle of the night, that was what he needed.\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cYoung master Raon.\u201dSylvia, Helen, and the maids were waiting in the entrance hall.\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here for long enough. I couldn\u2019t talk to you enough, and you didn\u2019t eat enough\u2026\u201dSylvia teared up as she expressed her regrets.\u201cI can come back every weekend from now on.\u201dUnlike before, when he was a temporary trainee, as an official trainee he could return to the annex building during weekends.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere became heavy. It looked like Sylvia\u2019s feelings had spread to the maids.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll be back.\u201dAwkward situations and emotions like that were his Achilles\u2019 heel. Raon quickly waved his hand and walked towards the exit of the annex building.As he opened the door, he met Judiel\u2019s eyes. She was sitting at the end of the line of maids.\u201cHuff!\u201dJudiel covered her mouth, about to scream. Her forehead was drenched in cold sweat, and she was shaking all over. She was the picture of someone overwhelmed by the monster they called fear.\u2018It looks like I won\u2019t need to worry.\u2019That was what he\u2019d wanted, but he didn\u2019t like dominating people with fear.He thought he should properly accept her as his subordinate once she brought him valuable information from the Central Martial Palace.You are such a monstrous guy.Wrath sounded like he was sighing as he spoke, all while watching Judiel\u2019s expression.\u2018Being called a monster by an actual monster isn\u2019t too bad. What a compliment.\u2019Raon slightly smiled and made his way towards the fifth training ground for the first time in a week.***Raon arrived at the training ground ten minutes earlier than the scheduled time.The number of children had visibly decreased. Out of the one hundred sixty people, only forty-two remained. It made the training ground look half empty.The fact that only a quarter remained showed that Rimmer was meticulous about results, despite his usual frivolous appearance.\u201cRaon Zieghart\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201d\u201cHe looks different again, somehow\u2026\u201dThe way the children looked at Raon had clearly changed.Six months ago, they looked at him with mockery, ridicule, and a little bit of compassion. Now, however, they looked at him with jealousy, surprise, and admiration.However, Raon wasn\u2019t interested in them.As he was warming up with only the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 in mind, he heard light steps approaching, followed by a nasally sound similar to sniffing.\u2018Those steps\u2026\u2019When he turned back, Runaan was there with her vacant eyes, just as he\u2019d expected.Now that girl is following you around while sniffing. I thought she was a cat, not a dog.\u2018I\u2019m not sure. She looks like a puppy and a cat at the same time.\u2019Raon awkwardly met Runaan\u2019s eyes. She approached a step closer to him than usual before stopping.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHe didn\u2019t understand why she suddenly thanked him.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter thanking him, Runaan\u2019s eyes started to resemble a cat waiting for food, sparkling unusually.\u201cEh, okay.\u201dRaon responded with a puzzled expression and Runaan stepped back after bowing slightly. The distance between them returned to the usual.\u201cUmm!\u201dShe clenched her fist as if she\u2019d accomplished something.\u201cWhy did you suddenly thank me?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m grateful.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRunaan tilted her head as if Raon was the weird one. It looked like he wasn\u2019t going to get an answer even if he kept asking her.Wh-what? What is she trying to do!\u2018I don\u2019t know, either.\u2019It was his first time seeing a child like\u00a0Runaan in both his past and current lives. Looking at her blank purple eyes made him space out\u2014like he was watching a bonfire.But since she wasn\u2019t disturbing him, nor picking a fight with him, he couldn\u2019t really do anything about it. After all, she\u2019d thanked him\u2014even if he didn\u2019t know the reason.\u2018Is it because I\u2019m not familiar with emotions?\u2019Wrath was also confused, but a psychopath like him couldn\u2019t be used as a standard.\u2018So, this is how I learn about being flustered.\u2019Raon sighed. He couldn\u2019t find the answer no matter how much he thought, so he shook his head to return to his senses.\u201cYoung master!\u201dDorian ran up to him, green hair fluttering like wings.\u201cIt\u2026 it has been a long time!\u201dHe bowed at a 90-degree angle, as if he were bowing to an instructor.\u201cHo-how have you been? I thought I would die. I already felt like I\u2019d die when I was just a temporary trainee, so I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it will be now that I\u2019m an official tr-trainee. I kept having nightmares. Ugh\u2026\u201dDorian kept talking without waiting for the answer. He was a weirdo for being scared instead of being proud of becoming an official trainee.\u201cBut I\u2019m glad that young master Raon is the top trainee. If young master Burren was the top, then I\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have been able to breathe. It would\u2019ve been better that I failed the exam\u2026\u201dWhen Dorian was saying that, Burren entered the training ground along with the collaterals.\u201cHiee!\u201dDorian collapsed under Burren\u2019s cold gaze.\u201cHic! Hic!\u201dDorian started to hiccup while trembling all over.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dWithout paying attention to the scared Dorian, Burren approached Raon.\u201cI admit my defeat from one week ago. I showed everyone my disgraceful side. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dBurren bowed at a 90-degree angle without any hesitation.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cLord Bu-Burren!\u201dThe trainees around them opened their mouths wide in surprise.\u201cHowever!\u201dBurren\u2019s eyes were burning when he raised his head.\u201cI didn\u2019t give up. I will stand in front of you again, no matter what it takes. I won\u2019t withdraw, nor will I give up. Of course, I have no intention of losing to you, either.\u201dAfter Raon, Burren also pointed his finger at Runaan. He then walked to the left.\u201cI\u2026 I thought I\u2019d die.\u2019Dorian stood while trembling, as he was chilly.\u201cWh-what shall I do now? Shall I go ahead and beg?\u201dHis eyes were moving twice as fast as before. It was curious how he could still stay conscious in that state.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dRaon shook his head. Burren was only looking at him and Runaan. He didn\u2019t seem to be paying attention to anyone else.He still doesn\u2019t know his position, even after getting beaten up. Follow him and pluck out his eyes, right now!\u2018That\u2019s pretty amazing on its own.\u2019Accepting his own mistake and asking for a rematch wasn\u2019t an easy feat to achieve for a thirteen-year-old child. It was a behavior befitting the direct line of the prestigious Zieghart family.I don\u2019t care if that\u2019s amazing or not. The King of Essence didn\u2019t like it, so kill him.\u2018Hah!\u2019Raon snorted. When one nuisance finally closed his mouth, the other started talking. It looked like silence was never going to happen.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Swoosh!As he was flexing his ankle and ignoring Wrath\u2019s anger, a green wind burst over the walls.\u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I overslept a bit because I was drinking yesterday.\u201dRimmer appeared alongside the wind. He smiled awkwardly while scratching the back of his head, his hair resembling a bird\u2019s nest.Snap!Someone could be heard grinding their teeth. It was Burren.How dare he make the King of Essence wait! That arrogant pointy-eared bastard has finally gone insane! Tear off his ears, now !Wrath was boiling with uncontrollable anger. It looked like Burren and Wrath could become friends.Rimmer walked onto the platform, humming.\u201cDid you rest well?\u201dHe waved his hand. The way he was faltering made it seem like he wasn\u2019t completely awake.\u201cYes!\u201dOn the other hand, the children\u2019s shouts were loud and strong.\u201cFirst of all, I congratulate you on becoming official trainees.\u2019\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cAs you must be already aware, those who failed were given the chance to join the sixth training ground if they wanted. Don\u2019t be too disappointed if your friend dropped out.\u201dRimmer smiled as he told them that they could meet with their friends again later.\u201cWe are going to start the official training from today onward. The overall structure is going to be the same. You will have to surpass your limits throughout the training, whether it\u2019s your mind, stamina, or martial arts. Not only is it the fastest method, it also allows you to reach the highest peak.\u201dHe concluded by saying that there was no end to basic training.However, he didn\u2019t sound all that convincing with the lazy display he put on, what with his constant yawning.\u201cA few more training programs will be added from now on. The first is the aura cultivation method. Starting tomorrow, you will cultivate aura during daybreak and evening training.\u201dSince it was well known that the best time to cultivate aura was at daybreak and evening, everyone nodded.\u201cWe will also start the swordsmanship and fist technique training that you\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\u201cOhh!\u201d\u201cFinally!\u201dThe children\u2019s eyes shone like jewels as he spooky about the swordsmanship and fist technique.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dJust as Rimmer was about to continue, the training ground door burst open.Whoosh!Standing in the doorway, the origin of the dusty wind, was a girl in her mid-teens.Her ebony hair was flowing over her left shoulder, and her eyes\u2014clearly separated into black and white\u2014shone like pearls. Her skin was as white as the snow.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201dThe boys on the training ground couldn\u2019t close their mouths because of her graceful figure, so different from Runaan\u2019s.However\u2026\u201cOh, fuck. Why is it so hard to open the door?!\u201dThe swear word coming from her mouth made the boys\u2019 jaws drop for a different reason.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201dRimmer smirked and pointed to the approaching girl.\u201cI wasn\u2019t in charge of her, but she is a failed trainee from the last batch. Since you will be training together from now on, give your greetings for now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Martha.\u201dThe girl that introduced herself as Martha frowned, chin raised. Despite her graceful appearance, her behavior wasn\u2019t any different from that a thug.\u201cApparently, she is a kind girl despite looking like that, so if you can get along\u2026\u201d\u201cMind your own business, sir.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess.\u201dRimmer laughed and shrugged his shoulders. On the other hand, the trainees\u2019 mouths were still wide open.\u201cJust warm yourselves up for today. We\u2019ll start regular training tomorrow. So.\u201dHe glanced at each of the children and grinned.\u201cRun, at full speed.\u201d\u201cI saw that coming.\u201dWhen Raon was about to kick off after nodding, three shadows sprinted forward.They belonged to Runaan, Burren, and Martha.\u201cYo-young master.\u201dWhen he was about to start running after them, Dorian approached him.\u201cWh-what do we do? That person is here.\u201d\u201cDo you know her?\u201d\u201cDo\u2026 Do you not know about her? She is also from the direct line.\u201d\u201cDirect line? I don\u2019t remember seeing her at the Judgment ceremony.\u201d\u201cAh, she isn\u2019t a normal direct line. She was adopted because of her talent.\u201dDorian told him that Martha was adopted as the daughter of Denier Zieghart, the third son of Glenn, and that she was adopted solely because of her talent.\u201cTalent, huh?\u201dRaon nodded, watching Martha run ahead of Burren and Runaan. She was one year older than them, but he could tell that her talent wasn\u2019t ordinary at all.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told, Lady Martha was the top trainee from the last batch, just like young master Raon.\u201d\u201cThen why did she fail?\u201d\u201cShe\u2026 She beat up.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dDorian continued, his folded arms trembling.\u201cNot long after training began, she beat up five tr-trainees until they were half dead. And there were two people from the direct line among them.\u201d\u201cTwo from the direct line\u2026\u201d\u201cBe\u2026 be careful. Apparently, she has a bad personality.\u201dRaon nodded slightly and started running.\u2018Be careful?\u2019She should be careful of him.He had no intention of hiding his strength. If anyone challenged him, he would trample them.***\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled violently once stamina training, which lasted until evening, was over.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m dying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only rested for one week, yet\u2026\u201dMost of the trainees were groaning on the ground.\u201cLet\u2019s stop for today, since overdoing it will affect tomorrow\u2019s training.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you for your trouble.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe children bowed to Rimmer and the instructors before collapsing again.\u201cI\u2019ve said this before, but the aura cultivation will start tomorrow. Since I\u2019m going to distribute the cultivation book, those who haven\u2019t acquired an aura yet should come forward.\u201dAs Rimmer gestured with his hand, books with a thickness of a pinky fingernail rose onto the platform.\u201cDon\u2019t be disappointed because it\u2019s a supplied cultivation book. The Rinden aura cultivation technique will work anywhere in the continent.\u201dWhile most of them didn\u2019t move, only a few trainees with commoner backgrounds came forward and accepted the cultivation books.\u201cHmm?\u201dRimmer\u2019s gaze was directed at Raon. Despite not having any aura, he wasn\u2019t coming forth.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you have any aura, either.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to learn the aura cultivation technique that I\u2019ve obtained recently.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dIt looked like he\u2019d obtained a cultivation book from the family head by exchanging his bronze tablet for it.\u2018He must have been given one equivalent or higher than a silver tablet.\u2019Since Glenn treasured Raon more than he pretended to, Rimmer was certain he gave him a cultivation technique better than Rinden.\u201cThose who have already learned an aura cultivation technique shall cultivate in their respective room at daybreak. Those who\u2019ve received a cultivation book today, as well as Raon Zieghart, shall come out here at daybreak tomorrow.\u201d\u201cMe, too?\u201dRaon tilted his head.\u201cSince you haven\u2019t learned an aura yet.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s stop for today\u2026\u201d\u201cWait. I have something to say.\u201dMartha, who didn\u2019t have a single drop of sweat despite finishing stamina training, raised her hand.\u201cWho is the top trainee here?\u201dShe looked through everyone, with her hands on her waist.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dRaon opened his mouth, facing Martha\u2019s black eyes.\u201cThe direct line and vassal families must all be dead to lose to a brat who doesn\u2019t even have an aura.\u201dLaughing at Burren and Runaan, she stood in front of Raon.\u201cI can\u2019t bear someone weaker than me standing above me.\u201dCool air surrounded Martha\u2019s entire body.\u201cLet\u2019s fight.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Martha Zieghart raised her chin, her hand on her waist. Her arrogant eyes didn\u2019t match her graceful appearance, but it also looked natural.\u2018Is this place the problem?\u2019Raon lightly kicked the floor of the training ground a couple times. Dorian had warned him, but he didn\u2019t believe she would start picking a fight with him immediately. It looked like there really wasn\u2019t anyone decent around him.I can\u2019t believe there would be someone even more arrogant than the pointy-eared bastard and blue eyes. Give your body to me. The King of Essence will freeze her whole.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Wrath started to freak out after Martha\u2019s taunt. The wrath he was venting was a lot fiercer than usual.\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cMartha Zieghart.\u201dWhile Raon was considering how to respond, a precocious and cold voice could be heard.\u201cWhat kind of unrefined act are you performing?\u201dIt was Burren Zieghart. He was glaring coldly at Martha.\u201cHaaah?\u201dMartha made a wry face. It wasn\u2019t a face that a child from a prestigious family should be making, but an expression of someone who had one foot into the dark side.\u201cDid you just say that to your senior?\u201dShe approached Burren with a smile.\u201cIf you keep shooting your mouth off, you\u2019ll end up dead immediately. You\u2019d better choose your words more carefully next time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my line. Raon Zieghart was acknowledged as the top trainee in front of the head of house and the instructor. Are you trying to deny that?\u201dBurren came forward to stop Martha as if it were his own problem.\u201cI know you also made a fuss because you couldn\u2019t accept the results of the test.\u201dThe corners of Martha\u2019s lips raised. It was a thick, scornful smile. She already knew what had happened during the test, despite acting like she didn\u2019t know who the top trainee was.\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201dBurren calmly nodded.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see the disgraceful behavior that I showed back then. That\u2019s why I\u2019m stopping you now.\u201d\u201cHuuh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t soil the name of Zieghart, Martha Zieghart.\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes, observing Burren\u2019s back.\u2018That guy\u2026\u2019Burren\u2019s eyes were clear. He really seemed to be trying to prevent the situation from going awry, rather than just getting on her nerves.It seemed he was sincere when he lowered his head to apologize.Step!Burren wasn\u2019t the only one trying to stop Martha. Runaan also stepped in front of Raon, trying to protect him.\u201cAnd do you think the same?\u201dMartha grinned, looking through Runaan and Burren.\u201cLeave.\u201dRunaan said a single word with a vacant gaze.\u201cStep back, Martha.\u201d\u201cI already told you.\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cI don\u2019t listen to those weaker than me!\u201dHer fist pierced through the air, storming towards Burren.Whir!Right before the aura-enhanced fist reached Burren\u2019s face, a green wind shot up.Wham!Rimmer, who used to be on the platform, appeared in the blink of an eye and blocked Martha\u2019s fist.\u201cYou really are ignoring me too much. Even if you think I\u2019m easy, it\u2019s regrettable that you are acting like I don\u2019t exist.\u201dHe pushed Martha\u2019s fist back with a cheerful smile.\u201cMartha, I heard you failed because of that temper. It looks like you haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cUnlike Burren or Runaan, Raon hasn\u2019t learned aura yet, just as you\u2019ve said. Do you really wanna fight, knowing that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to use my aura, either.\u201d\u201cYou know, that still doesn\u2019t make you equal. Since there will be another opportunity in the future, stay patient for now.\u201d\u201cTsk\u2026\u201dMartha pouted and took a step back. However, she kept glaring at Burren without leaving.\u201cBurren Zieghart.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou know your older brother was beaten up by me and was forced to stay in bed for an entire month. If you are trying to be arrogant, you\u2019d better get stronger first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m different from my older brother.\u201d\u201cWe will see about that.\u201dWith a thin smile, Martha turned away. Runaan and Burren, seeing that, relaxed and stepped aside.At that moment, Martha turned around and kicked off from the ground at the same time.\u201cI hate cowards that hide behind others even more than arrogant bastards!\u201dIn a flash, she pounced on Raon, and swung her fist.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dBurren and Runaan couldn\u2019t react, and Rimmer was staying still despite seeing it.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes remained calm. He\u2019d already expected her to come at him the moment she shifted her center of gravity as she turned around.Tap!He used the back of his hand to fend off Martha\u2019s fist, which was aimed at his chest.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cAre you ready to be punished?\u201dHe swung his clenched fist. His fist, including the rotation of Void Tiger Fist, was aimed at Martha\u2019s defenseless abdomen.\u201cEek!\u201dPanic could be seen in her eyes. Gritting her teeth, she gathered brown energy in her left fist.Wham!A bare fist and an aura-imbued forearm collided, pushing Raon and Martha back at the same time.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you weren\u2019t going to use your aura?\u201dRaon dusted off his red-hot fist.\u201cWh-what are you?!\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes, which had distinct white and black sections, were bloodshot. She was even stuttering, despite having always been confident.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cDid\u2026 did you really block that?\u201dRimmer giggled, and Burren swallowed hard.\u201cEek!\u201dMartha engulfed her entire body with a brown aura.\u201cThat\u2019s as far as you go.\u201dAs she was about to charge in, Rimmer straightened his posture and stepped in front of her.\u201cI can\u2019t allow you any more than this.\u201dDespite smiling, he was emitting sharp pressure. He was different from before, when he was playing around.\u201cBut I\u2014!\u201d\u201cEven if you fight without an aura now, it will only end up in an incomplete combustion. Try fighting him later, when Raon has learned a proper aura. I will allow it then.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dMartha glared at Raon while grinding her teeth, before turning away. This time she didn\u2019t even look back. She left and closed the door with a loud bang.\u201cRaon.\u201dRimmer approached and grabbed his shoulder.\u201cHow did you defend against Martha\u2019s attack? It looked like you knew about it already.\u201d\u201cIt was her center of gravity.\u201dRaon snapped out the answer like nothing.\u201cCenter of gravity?\u201dThe question was from Burren. Runaan also seemed curious, her ears perking up like a rabbit.\u201cWhen she turned around, she shifted her center of gravity to her back instead of her front. She wasn\u2019t aiming for Burren or Runaan, but at me, in the middle. I figured she was going to come at me for sure.\u201d\u201cWith just that\u2026\u201dBurren frowned hearing the answer, and Runaan fell deep in thought as her eyes grew empty.\u201cHmm!\u201dRimmer exclaimed lightly.\u2018His observation and physical abilities are as outstanding as always.\u2019He counterattacked immediately by discerning the opponent\u2019s intention from their center of gravity. His talent wasn\u2019t normal, for sure.\u201c\u2026\u201dBurren examined the floor where Raon and Martha had fought, then left the training ground biting his lip.\u201cI scolded her properly, so she won\u2019t bother you for a while. But you will inevitably face her after you learn aura.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cBy the way, it looks like the Void Tiger Fist\u2019s rotation has become yours completely now.\u201dThat rotation had been used when Raon struck Martha. That was actually more amazing than his counterattack.\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201dRaon shook his head and turned back.What have you done? Did you let her live, despite her swinging her fist at the King of Essence? You must tear off her limbs and imprison her inside an eternal glacier\u2026\u2018I struck her back.\u2019That\u2019s not enough. Her head needs to be smashed!\u2018It\u2019s not worth it.\u2019There was nothing to gain from having a fist fight with her like that.It was way more beneficial to make a bet, staking the title of top trainee on it, once there was something she could give him.Kuh! She needs to be shattered into pieces after being frozen whole\u2026\u2018Just wait. I\u2019ll let you see something even better.\u2019Raon smiled and left the training ground.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon arrived at the training ground before the sun rose. He\u2019d wanted to cultivate alone, but he didn\u2019t have a choice since he was instructed to do otherwise.Since most of the trainees had already learned an aura, there were only eight people at the training ground and all of them were commoners.\u201cYo-young master.\u201dDorian approached him with drooping shoulders.\u201cI\u2026 I heard you can die from learning aura. Is that true? I also heard it hurts, as if your energy center is breaking\u2026\u201dThat wasn\u2019t exactly wrong, since there were people who got severely hurt or died trying to learn a bad cultivation technique.Of course, the cultivation technique that Zieghart was supplying was a stable one, and there were excellent instructors around them, so there weren't going to be any issues.\u201cIt will be fine.\u201dHe repeated the same thing he kept telling Dorian whenever he met him.\u201cRi-right? I feel more at ease since the young master says so.\u201dDorian smiled awkwardly, controlling his breath. And in the next moment\u2026\u201cIs\u2026 Is it really alright? Even if it is stable, someone could still be in danger. If that someone ends up being me, everything will be over! Wh-what shall I do? If I die\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon turned his head. Dorian\u2019s insecurities weren\u2019t going to disappear, no matter what he told him. And there was no reason for Raon to take care of him, either.\u201cI\u2019m not late today, right? I have perfect timing.\u201dRimmer entered over the wall, like always. He grinned, looking at the still-dark sky.\u201cSince the sun will rise soon, let\u2019s start immediately.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe children\u2019s voices were even louder than usual, filled with the expectation of learning aura.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about falling behind because the other children have learned aura before you. Aura is a martial art that you need to acquire throughout your entire life, so the others are only one step ahead of you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen enter a personal cultivation room with the instructor next to you. The instructors will help you until your cultivation stabilizes, so tell them if you are curious about anything or having any difficulty.\u201dOnce Rimmer clapped his hands, the instructors behind him brought the children to the personal cultivation rooms.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon looked around since there was nobody next to him.\u201cYou will enter a personal training room alone.\u201d\u201cThen why did you call me?\u201d\u201cBecause a problem sometimes occurs when you learn to cultivate using a cultivation book. I\u2019ll be waiting outside, so you can feel safe and cultivate in peace.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018I can\u2019t trust you.\u2019The Rimmer that he\u2019d seen so far wasn\u2019t a trustworthy person. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he was napping outside while Raon was dying in the cultivation room.\u201cWhat are those eyes? Can\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dHe shook his head and entered the cultivation room. He didn\u2019t wish for him to help him. Somewhat guarding him while he cultivated was plenty helpful.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon closed his eyes and started using the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019. A fluttering red flame appeared on his shoulders.\u2018Let\u2019s begin.\u2019***As soon as Raon entered the training room, Rimmer straightened his posture. He silently extended his senses in order to avoid bothering anyone.\u2018Let\u2019s see what he got.\u2019Using his extended senses, he started reading the mana wave occurring around Raon\u2019s training room.\u2018It's a fire attribute.\u2019Hot and dynamic mana was storming around Raon.\u2018This isn\u2019t an ordinary cultivation technique?!\u2019The amount of energy he felt from Raon\u2019s mana circuit was far more powerful than normal. It was an explosive energy, like lava coming straight out of a volcanic eruption. The cultivation technique was definitely not ordinary, given how he was controlling such mana in the learning phase.\u2018That\u2019s not something that a person can exchange for a bronze tablet. Even a gold tablet wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u2019He\u2019d told the children that the Rinden cultivation technique was no different from the better cultivation techniques, but Raon\u2019s was different.It was better than the cultivation techniques learned by the direct line.Rimmer\u2019s heart started pounding in excitement, eager to learn what kind of aura Raon would acquire in his energy center\u2014once he finished learning that cultivation technique.However, the flow of the aura was very difficult to understand. It looked like it was going to take a lot of time and effort until he finished acquiring it.\u2018\u2026Hmm?\u2019Rimmer lowered his thin eyebrows. Inside the mana circuit, where the hot energy was running through, the cold energy was also spreading out.\u2018No way! That guy!\u2019His jaw dropped as he sensed Raon\u2019s flow of energy.\u2018Instead of erasing the ice in his mana circuit, he is leading it along with the rest!\u2019Raon was accumulating the ice in his energy center, instead of getting rid of it after it was pushed away by the hot energy.\u2018Is this really from a guy controlling mana for the first time?\u2019He had never imagined someone that hadn\u2019t even been learning a cultivation technique for a week could control mana with just his will.\u2018It\u2019s not thanks to the aura cultivation technique he is using. It\u2019s his talent in action.\u2019Raon\u2019s ability to control mana was more surprising than the excellency of his cultivation technique. Even if he\u2019d been controlling mana from before his birth, he shouldn\u2019t have been as good as he was.\u2018His talent wasn\u2019t only in his body and martial arts, but also in mana\u2026\u2019He\u2019d heard Raon had been revealed to have the worst talent in mana during the Judgment Ceremony. However, he was showing mana control surpassing even Burren or Runaan.\u2018If he manages to properly learn that cultivation technique\u2026\u2019Rimmer clenched his fist, smiling in anticipation.\u2018A new monster might be born.\u2019***An hour later, Raon Zieghart came out of the cultivation room while exhaling hot breath.\u201cRaon.\u201dRimmer came down from the platform and approached him.\u201cTrain in your dormitory starting tomorrow.\u201d\u201cPardon? You told me yesterday I should come here every day\u2026\u201d\u201cWhatever, train in your dormitory, instead.\u201dCultivating aura in the dormitory couldn\u2019t be sensed from the outside because the dormitory\u2019s walls were shrouded in magic.If somebody sensed Raon\u2019s aura cultivation technique, they could start taking drastic measures to hold him in check. That was why it was better to cultivate in the dormitory, which was defended by magic.\u201cI\u2019ll visit occasionally to help your progress.\u201d\u201cYou will? Hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not always lazy, okay?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRaon calmly nodded, like always.\u2018I have to tell him about this right away.\u2019Rimmer grinned, sensing the leftover hot mana spreading out of Raon.***After training ended, Rimmer visited the audience chamber.\u201cYou have been coming here often recently.\u201dGlenn Zieghart, who had been sitting immobile on his throne like a stone statue, lifted his head.\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dRimmer grinned and walked up the red carpet in the center.\u201cMartha has joined training. Her personality was hotter than I\u2019d heard.\u201d\u201cThat child won\u2019t change until she loses to somebody else her age.\u201dGlenn nodded, like he had expected it.\u201cThen we might see that happen soon.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cShe had a small encounter with Raon.\u201dRimmer told him about the incident from the day before between Raon and Martha, involving Burren and Runaan.\u201cIs that so? So, they\u2019ve already\u2026\u201dGlenn lightly nodded. He looked slightly happy, despite staying expressionless.\u201cAh, but that\u2019s not the reason I came to visit. What did you actually give Raon?\u201dRimmer raised his voice unlike how he\u2019d acted in front of Raon.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing a cultivation technique with such a complicated yet orderly flow. On top of that, it\u2019s a fire attribute\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a cultivation technique called \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.\u201dGlenn casually responded.\u201cTen Thousand Flames Cultivation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the cultivation technique of the first head of house.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s the first head\u2019s, I see, that\u2019s why it's so\u2026 Wait? Waiiit?\u201dRimmer\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cThe\u2026 The first clan leader?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHuh, I thought you would give him a cultivation technique equivalent to a silver or gold tablet, but I never expected you\u2019d give him the first head\u2019s technique. You must really cherish him.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 chose him. I didn\u2019t originally intend to give it to him.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn didn\u2019t explain in detail. Rimmer guessed there were some circumstances around it.\u201cDid you come here to ask about that?\u201d\u201cOh no, it was about Raon. His talent is definitely not normal. Not only in martial arts, but his talent in mana is also outrageous.\u201dRimmer described everything that he\u2019d witnessed about Raon\u2019s flow of mana that day.\u201cI heard the Sword of Judgment said his talent was below average. Are you sure it\u2019s not broken?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGlenn Zieghart took his hand off the armrest and started rubbing his chin.\u2018He is also talented in mana\u2026\u2019The Sword of Judgment had shone gold after everyone had left, and it seemed that was indeed Raon\u2019s ability.\u201cHow is his body\u2019s condition?\u201d\u201cHis sweat is still cold, and he still breathes out icy breath. There definitely is a problem with his body, but he looks more comfortable after training.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn nodded. Just like Patrick said, it looked like moving his body was the correct answer.\u201cRaon has a special talent in both body and mana. He also has excellent observation, insight, and calmness. I think he can potentially become another successor.\u201d\u201cTalent doesn\u2019t matter. Even if he has that much potential, he is still too young.\u201d\u201cBut it isn\u2019t impossible. Because I don\u2019t really like your sons.\u201dRimmer looked up to Glenn with narrowed eyes.\u201cI became part of Zieghart to follow the flame I call my lord. However, there is no one that I wish to follow among the successors.\u201d\u201cImpossible. Was that why you wanted the position of instructor\u2026?\u201dGlenn narrowed his eyes. Despite having been weakened, Rimmer was still a sword master. The reason he refused every offer and became an instructor seemed to be to look for his king by himself.\u201cCan\u2019t Raon also become a successor if he meets the qualifications?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, he can.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dRimmer lowered his head with his eyes shining dark green, before taking a step back.\u201cAnd one more thing. Raon isn\u2019t just talented. Well, I think my lord knows it better than me.\u201dWith that last comment, he left the audience chamber and shut the door behind him.\u201cYes, I know that very well.\u201dGlenn had a dejected smile on his face, staring at the empty audience chamber.\u201cI know what kind of child he is, and what kind of thoughts he harbors.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26One month had passed since Raon began learning the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.He\u2019d been cultivating every day at daybreak and in the evening and continued until night. However, he still hadn\u2019t managed to create an aura.Because it was such a powerful\u2014if not the most powerful\u2014cultivation technique, its acquisition difficulty was also beyond imagination.Of course, his attempts at controlling the coldness inside of his mana circuit slowed down his progress, as well.\u2018Let\u2019s take it slow.\u2019Raon calmly closed his eyes in the center of the training ground.\u2018Because I have the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2019As long as he had the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, his talent in body and mana were always at their maximum. Instead of trying to progress quickly, it was better to work on his foundation.Thud!Right on time for the regular training, the door to the training ground opened wide. Rimmer, who wasn\u2019t late for some reason, entered.\u201cFrom today onward, you will study martial arts in the morning.\u201d\u201cOoh!\u201d\u201cWooow!\u201d\u201cFinally!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s swordsmanship! Swordsmanship!\u201dThe children raised their hands and started shouting.The trainees had only been training their stamina in the month since they\u2019d passed the test. It was natural for them to start shouting with joy.\u201cWhat made Zieghart known throughout the continent was swordsmanship, but the fist techniques aren\u2019t worse than the swordsmanship techniques. I\u2019ll show you the basic forms of the fist technique.\u201dRimmer laid down on the platform despite telling them he\u2019d show them the techniques.\u201cSkilled instructors, come forward.\u201dWhen he waved his hand while yawning, the instructor behind him stepped and started to perform a fist technique.\u2018It\u2019s the Seven Shaped Fist.\u2019It was a fist technique utilizing seven different shapes and was used as a basis for all fist techniques.Despite knowing the shapes, Raon had never learned it. That was because, in his previous life, the only purpose of his fists was killing his opponent instantly.\u201cAh, the 'Seven Shaped Fist'\u2026\u201d\u201cI already know about that.\u201d\u201cHaaah, it\u2019s gonna be boring.\u201dThe excitement disappeared from the faces of children that had seen the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019 before. It looked like they didn\u2019t feel enthusiastic because they\u2019d already learned it before coming to the training ground.\u201cYou look bored.\u201dRimmer snickered and wagged his finger.\u201cI know that many of you have already learned the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019 before. Once I confirm you\u2019ve properly learned it, I\u2019ll let you progress to the next step.\u201d\u201cNext step? What do you mean?\u201dDorian raised his hand and asked, despite always being afraid.\u201cYou all have the same status as trainees, but your levels aren\u2019t the same. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t need to train the exact same way. If you manage to exceed the standard I\u2019ve set, I\u2019ll let you progress immediately.\u201dRimmer murmured that the training methods in the past were too conventional.\u201cThat\u2019s good. I like that.\u201dMartha Zieghart smiled cheerfully and stepped forward.\u201cI thought I was going to learn the boring seven shapes over again, but this is the correct way. There\u2019s no reason for an outstanding person to step down to the level of a pathetic one.\u201d\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think about that. Anyway, reenact the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019 you just saw where you are standing. If I think it\u2019s enough, I\u2019ll let you start the next piece of training.\u201dAs soon as Rimmer finished talking, the children started performing the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019.\u2018They have a good foundation.\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes shone as he watched the children around him.\u2018It\u2019s not a prestigious family without reason.\u2019He\u2019d thought they would half-heartedly learn it and move on to the next step because it was part of the basics, but the children were moving their fists precisely, with an accurate amount of strength.\u201cHmm\u2026 As expected.\u201dRimmer nodded in satisfaction.\u201cMartha Zieghart, Burren Zieghart, Runaan Sullion\u2026\u201dWhen he called the names of trainees who\u2019d properly performed their \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019, there were less than twenty people left in the center.Raon Zieghart was standing among them with glittering red eyes.***\u201cHmm.\u201dRimmer nodded, watching the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019 that Raon Zieghart was performing.\u2018As expected, he hasn\u2019t learned it.\u2019His punch was unrefined, with no proper shape. He didn\u2019t seem to have learned anything, just as Silvia had said.However, since Raon had some experience from copying the flow of \u2018Void Tiger Fist\u2019 from Burren, he was going to grasp it in a few days.\u2018Let\u2019s see the other children\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t help watching Raon, but he also made sure to check the other children, heeding Glenn\u2019s warning.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Since they were recommended children, they mostly had excellent control and insight. They looked like they would progress to the next step pretty soon.\u2018Competition is so nice.\u2019It had the same principle as long-distance running.The children running ahead made an effort to keep those behind them from catching up, and those in the back did their best to catch up to those in the front. It was a virtuous circle of training.\u2018Now then.\u2019Rimmer checked on the trainees\u2014including Martha, Burren and Runaan\u2014that managed to pass the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019.Since Martha had already finished learning the second step\u2019s fist technique, she\u2019d started training with the third step, \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019.\u2018I guess that makes sense.\u2019Martha had failed last year, but it was because of her personality, not her ability. It looked like he needed to prepare something for her to train so that she wouldn\u2019t waste her time, along with a way to fix her temper.\u2018They are also doing well.\u2019Burren and Runaan were also aware of the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019, which was learned during the second step. It looked like the two of them would advance to the third step in the near future.Rimmer laid down and wrote down the information on the children on his notes.\u2018Now then, let\u2019s check\u2026 huh?\u2019When Rimmer looked at Raon again, after checking every other child, his eyes widened.\u2018What\u2026?\u2019During the brief time he\u2019d checked on the other children, the shape of the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019 was engraved in Raon Zieghart\u2019s punches.\u2018How does this make any sense?\u2019Rimmer lifted his body, unable to hold himself back.Raon was different from Martha, Runaan, and Burren. He certainly didn\u2019t know anything when he started, but he\u2019d become a completely different person already.Even though the 'Seven Shaped Fist' was a basic fist technique, and it was easy to follow, it didn\u2019t make any sense for him to show so much progress in less than an hour.\u2018What is this monster\u2026?\u2019It hadn\u2019t been long since he was surprised by how well Raon was controlling his mana, and he was shocked once again by how fast he learned martial arts. Rimmer jaw dropped.\u201cHaaah.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t planning to give him special treatment.He was going to send Raon on to the next step once he made sure that he had mastered the basics, but it looked like that time was going to come extremely soon.\u2018At this rate, by tomorrow\u2026 No, it might be this evening\u2026\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Martha Zieghart smiled while nimbly thrusting her fist.\u2018I like the instructors this time around.\u2019Before, she\u2019d been waiting for the moronic ones to catch up. However, that wasn\u2019t the right answer.The talented should keep rising, and the talentless should become stepping stones for them. That was the correct answer.When she looked to her left, she could see children learning the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019.She\u2019d learned it two years ago, so those that were learning it only now would never be able to catch up to her.By the time they\u2019d reach the second step, she would\u2019ve already finished learning the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 and started swordsmanship training.\u2018He\u2019s also over there.\u2019Martha smirked, looking at Raon punching at the center of the training ground.\u2018Raon Zieghart.\u2019The oddball who managed to get first place after voluntarily participating in training, despite being born with extreme coldness.Considering the way he\u2019d blocked her surprise attack the month before, his perception and movements were both exceptional. He was a talented guy.\u2018However.\u2019It was too late.He\u2019d only started learning aura and fist technique when he was thirteen years old. It was the same as starting to run a long time after the starting signal during a race.\u2018He is never gonna catch up to me.\u2019Her aura was already at three-star, and she\u2019d already learned various fist techniques and swordsmanship.Unlike Burren and Runaan, who\u2019d started to train during childhood, Raon couldn\u2019t even become her rival.\u2018He is just a stepping stone.\u2019Raon Zieghart was a mere stepping stone, unworthy of her attention.\u201cHmph!\u201dMartha snorted and turned her head away. She stopped paying attention to Raon, focusing on training the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 instead.When she was still improving in the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 until sunset, a man approached next to her.\u201cMy lady, it\u2019s time for your training as a member of the direct line.\u201dIt was her butler, Camel.\u201cAlright.\u201dMartha nodded and turned back. The other children were still practicing the beginner fist technique.\u201cHow pathetic.\u201d\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dWhen she was about to return while laughing at them, she heard Rimmer\u2019s voice.\u201cYou pass. Proceed to the next step.\u201dShe turned around at the voice, light as the wind. Raon Zieghart was casually nodding at him.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes widened. It was impossible to believe that in one day\u2014no, in half a day, he\u2019d managed to master the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019.\u2018Even I had to practice for four days!\u2019She was adopted into Zieghart thanks to her talent as a genius, and it still took her four days to master the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019.It didn\u2019t make sense that a mere stepping stone accomplished the same thing in only half a day.\u201cThen, please teach me the next fist technique.\u201d\u201cThe sun\u2019s already set. I can\u2019t be bothered, so let\u2019s do it tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be bothered, that\u2019s not something an instructor should sa\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dMartha interrupted Raon and Rimmer, who were having a conversation.\u201cSir Instructor, did he really pass the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019? Something that he only started learning today?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201dRimmer nodded, his green eyes open wide.\u201cAren\u2019t you being too lenient because you\u2019re lazy?\u201d\u201cLenient?\u201d\u201cDespite the seven shapes being the basics of fist techniques, it still takes a while to gain a grasp of it. There is no way he could manage to master it in only half a day.\u201d\u201cOf course he didn\u2019t master it. But it\u2019s enough to advance to the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019 training.\u201d\u201cHah! I mean, the criteria is too low.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer scratched his chin, then turned his head around to Raon.\u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s saying. Raon, try showing it to her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dRaon firmly shook his head.\u201cThe instructor has already told me I\u2019ve passed, so why do I have to repeat it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you do, then I\u2019ll teach you the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019 right now, instead of tomorrow.\u201dRimmer responded before Martha could interrupt.\u201cHa! Alright.\u201dRaon sighed lightly and stood, feet shoulder-width apart. Holding his breath, he thrust his fist. A heavy punch pierced through the evening\u2019s air.He took a step forward and thrust his left fist. The way it bent resembled a boomerang.Turning to his right, he struck with his right hand from his waist. Martha\u2019s bangs fluttered from the refreshing wind.Raon\u2019s form continued, brisk and energetic. He was accurately expressing the seven forms and spirits of the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019.Martha swallowed hard.Rimmer hadn\u2019t set the bar low. Raon Zieghart really had learned the forms and spirits of the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019 in only half a day.\u201cYou knew it already!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRaon raised his chin, as if he were asking what the hell she was talking about.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dShe was speechless, because Raon\u2019s punches from earlier were definitely those of a novice.\u201cHow about it, Martha? Isn\u2019t it enough to be recognized?\u201dRimmer chuckled, as if he were teasing her.\u201cHe did that in half a day?\u201d\u201cWhat did I just see?\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so crazy.\u201dThe instructors and children also couldn\u2019t close their mouths from their surprise.\u201cI\u2026 I also did that much.\u201dMartha forced a smile and turned around. Biting her lip, she left the training ground.\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019It was just the \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019. It wasn\u2019t even swordsmanship, but the most basic part of fist techniques. There was no way he could catch up to her just because he could learn it a little quickly.Yes, that could never happen.Martha calmed herself down and headed towards the direct line training ground. But the trajectory of Raon\u2019s fist was deeply engraved in her memory.***\u201cWhat does she want?\u201dRaon dusted off his hands and frowned.\u201cShe must be surprised.\u201dRimmer snickered, watching Martha leave the training ground.\u201cI was also surprised. It was my first time seeing somebody learn as quickly as you.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment, but please teach me the next fist technique.\u201d\u201cHah! Of course I will.\u201dHe sighed lightly and got up. After warming up his waist and wrists, he looked up at the sky.\u201cBut Raon.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dUpon seeing Rimmer\u2019s expression, Raon suddenly became anxious.\u201cIt\u2019s too late today. See you again tomorrow!\u2019He created a gust of wind to obstruct Raon\u2019s vision and disappeared over the wall. It was a swift and determined movement, one that Raon couldn\u2019t even think about stopping.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe King of Essence has told you before. That pointy-eared bastard looked like he\u2019d betray you. One day on a battlefield, he will run away, leaving you behind.It looked like Wrath had become a fortune teller, since he was predicting Rimmer\u2019s future.\u2018Somehow, I expected it.\u2019Raon licked his lips. He\u2019d thought it might happen the moment he saw Rimmer\u2019s reaction.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dBurren approached him with heavy steps.\u201cI\u2019m heading out to receive training that only the direct line can receive.\u201dRaon already knew about it. While the trainees had their individual training, the direct line could receive additional lessons.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to say that it's unfair. But I\u00a0will\u00a0beat you, no matter what method I have to use.\u201dAfter glaring at Raon for a bit, he left the training ground.Those arrogant eyes are still the same. One day, I will\u2026\u2018No, they\u2019re different.\u2019Raon shook his head, watching Burren\u2019s back. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but Burren\u2019s eyes had become clear a one month ago.The competitiveness still remained, but it didn\u2019t look like he was going to play dirty like before.Step.Raon turned towards the footsteps approaching from behind. Runaan was looking at him with blank eyes.\u201cAren\u2019t you going there as well?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to go?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cYou can learn powerful swordsmanship\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201dRunaan slowly shook her head.\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon licked his lips and made his way over to the training room. He could hear crunching footsteps as Runaan followed behind him.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27\u201cHuff!\u201dBurren Zieghart exhaled heavily after performing the different forms of the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019, one after another.\u2018This isn\u2019t easy.\u2019The second step, \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019, was something he\u2019d already started learning back at the main building. Because of that, he could pass it without much difficulty. However, the third step, \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019, wasn\u2019t easy to learn.\u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 was a basic fist technique that included advanced principles, which made it difficult to grasp.\u2018But I should be able to finish it by next week.\u2019Since the training he did back in the main building had solidified his foundation, his posture was starting to get better. Because it\u2019d already been two weeks since he\u2019d started learning the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019, it looked like he could pass the test on it in about another week after.\u2018Let\u2019s do it again.\u2019Burren clenched his back teeth and started to train the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 once again.He straightened his posture once he finished training until he felt burned out. His training clothes were completely wet, sticking to his body.Whoosh!While he was catching his breath, he could hear violent wind from the right side. When he turned around, he saw a beautiful girl with long black hair swinging her sword fiercely.\u2018Martha Zieghart.\u2019Martha had finished the fist technique training a long time ago, starting swordsmanship training before anyone else.With perfect posture and an established form, her swordsmanship made him admire her unconsciously. He had to acknowledge her skills, despite her damned personality.\u2018But\u2026\u2019There was something strange.Martha was progressing faster than anyone in the training ground, and her skills were also the most outstanding, to a point that she\u2019d surprised all the instructors.However, her expressions didn\u2019t show any hint of being relaxed.As if a hungry beast was chasing her, she kept swinging her sword with a face full of irritation and tension.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019Burren knit his brows and turned his head to the other side, where\u00a0that guy\u00a0was training.Raon Zieghart.He was a monster that had grasped the forms of the \u2018Seven Shaped Fists\u2019 and finished learning the \u2018Advanced Rising\u2019 Fist in only ten days. With him chasing her, it was understandable that she couldn\u2019t relax.It was unbelievable, but he was actually learning the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019, the same technique Burren was training with.Whoosh!Raon thrust his fist, producing the sound of air being bent, and his stomping foot shook the entire floor of the training ground.The movements of his hands and feet were already exhibiting the exquisite principles of the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019.\u2018What a monstrous guy.\u2019People had called Burren both a genius and a monster as he grew up. He hadn\u2019t imagined that he would say that exact same thing about somebody else.\u2018I don\u2019t understand how he can do that.\u2019Burren had been taught the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019 for a month before becoming a trainee. Even then, he still needed to train three more days before starting to learn the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019.\u2018And people said that\u00a0I\u00a0was progressing quickly.\u2019He was called amazing for learning it in one month, yet Raon managed to do the same in only ten days. Moreover, he didn\u2019t only grasp the forms, but his fist technique properly contained the principles.\u2018At this rate\u2026\u2019He figured Raon would catch up by the time he moved on to the swordsmanship training.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dBurren sighed lightly. In fact, Raon's talent wasn\u2019t the only thing that surprised him during his observation.\u2018Effort and willpower.\u2019There wasn\u2019t a single instance of Raon not doing his best during his training. He kept exhaling cold air from his lips and his entire body was drenched with sweat.Even from a third party\u2019s point of view, his body wasn\u2019t in a proper condition yet. However, he never gave up on any training.People could easily say that they did their best, or that they tried to the very end. However, they rarely actually followed through with those words.\u2018But this guy does.\u2019Raon always did his best, burning up everything he had.Rimmer had mentioned that the fastest way to train was to surpass one\u2019s limits. Raon was executing that method more efficiently than anyone.\u2018He surprises me every time I look at him.\u2019Despite considering him an enemy, he couldn\u2019t stop admiring him. He was more fit to be a Zieghart than anyone else on the training ground.\u201cBurren, your hands have stopped. Go to the rest hall if you want to rest!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019ll continue.\u201dBurren lowered his head when he heard the instructor's shout. He sighed and emptied his head.\u2018Yes. It\u2019s not the time for me to stay like this.\u2019He\u2019d resolved to not lose to Raon, no matter what. He had to do his best in every moment, taking after Raon\u2019s willpower.Pang!Burren focused his mind and thrust his clenched fist.***Whoosh!After swinging a sword with an air of madness, as if there were an enemy in front of her, Martha stopped her hand. She sighed lightly and squeezed her hand holding the sword.\u2018How annoying.\u2019Despite being the only person to be holding a sword in the training ground, an unbearable irritation overwhelmed her.\u2018This is all\u2026\u2019Martha bit her lip and looked around. She could see a guy swinging his fist with steam billowing out of his mouth.Raon Zieghart.As soon as she saw him, her body started to feel tight, as if she had an upset stomach.\u2018He has already started to learn the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019.\u2019While she started to learn the swordsmanship technique, Raon had finished learning two fist techniques and started learning the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019.Unlike Burren or Runaan, who\u2019d already learned fist techniques, it was the first time Raon was learning them. He was progressing at a ridiculous pace.\u2018Damn\u2026\u2019His talent sent shivers down her spine. He could catch up to her at any time now, and that fact was engulfing her in a breathtaking fear.\u2018That position used to be mine.\u2019Ever since she\u2019d been adopted as a Zieghart, she\u2019d always been the chaser.She\u2019d caught up to the direct line and collaterals, who were proud of the talents of their geniuses, and she\u2019d laughed at them despairing over their losses.\u2018And yet\u2026\u2019Now that the positions had been reversed, she realized how scary it was to be chased after.Whoosh!Martha swung her sword downwards, trying to erase Raon\u2019s steadily growing presence.The training sword slashed through the thin air, full of irritation.She kept swinging her sword, over and over, until the sun went from the middle in the sky to beyond the western hills.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dMartha lowered her sword while exhaling a long breath. She was feeling a bit better after swinging her sword for the entire day.However, the moment she looked to her right, she had to frown again. Raon\u2019s fist technique was getting better even at that moment.\u2018Doesn\u2019t that bastard even get tired?\u2019To train the entire day, all while remaining extremely focused the entire time\u2026 Calling him hardcore wasn\u2019t even enough. She had never seen that type of person, even in the back streets.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cTsk.\u201dMartha turned around and left the training ground after the sun had completely set.\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dHer butler Camel, who was waiting for her next to the door, bowed to her. Since she was out of energy, she just nodded.\u201cMy lady.\u201dCamel called after her while catching up to her quick steps.\u201cMy lady doesn\u2019t need to be so impatient.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt seems everyone forgot because of his recent actions, but the young master Raon has a huge weakness.\u201dCamel smiled after glancing at the training ground.\u201cAre you talking about his illness? He is a tough one, so he doesn\u2019t care about pain.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201cThe young master Raon has the worst talent in aura.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMy lady must not be aware because it\u2019d happened before my lady was adopted. But the young master Raon\u2019s mana perception was determined to be the worst during the Judgment Ceremony.\u201dCamel smiled while pointing at the energy center.\u201cIsn\u2019t the young master Raon the only person who still hasn\u2019t managed to acquire an aura in the fifth training ground?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dMartha nodded. The trainees who\u2019d started learning the Rinden cultivation technique two months ago had already accumulated aura in their energy center.Just like Camel said, Raon was the only person among the trainees who hadn\u2019t acquired an aura.\u201cA cultivation technique obtained with a bronze tablet would be a middle tier, or middle-upper tier. It would only be slightly better than Rinden. However, considering that he still hasn\u2019t managed to acquire an aura, his talent in mana must be the worst\u2014just like the Judgment Ceremony determined.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cEven if he is talented in swordsmanship and fist techniques, he can\u2019t become a proper warrior if his talent in aura is so miniscule.\u201dCamel shook his head while giving off a kind-looking smile.\u201cI see.\u201dMartha nodded her head, the corners of her lips curling up into a smile.\u2018So, he didn\u2019t have any talent in aura.\u2019She\u2019d forgotten about it because Raon\u2019s talent in martial arts was so outstanding, but he still hadn\u2019t managed to acquire an aura.It was said that a warrior with a weak talent in aura was a deficient one. Raon Zieghart was just a deficient warrior whose talents were all focused on martial arts.\u201cHehe.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stop herself from smiling. The anxiety that she\u2019d been feeling disappeared all at once.\u201cI was worried for nothing. I unnecessarily paid attention to somebody who wasn\u2019t worthy.\u201dMartha headed towards the direct line training ground with light steps, as if she\u2019d gotten rid of a lump of steel, and Camel followed her while smiling faintly with a mysterious air about him.***Raon didn\u2019t stop training for a single moment. Constantly moving, he engraved the principle and the flow of \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 in his body and mind.His back was drenched in cold sweat, and his mouth was breathing out steam. He was clearly tired, but his expression was as bright as facing the sun.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon smiled slightly as he moistened his dry lips.\u2018This is getting more and more interesting.\u2019The movement that the instructor had shown him was engraved in his brain with a margin of error smaller than 1mm, and its flow and form was reproduced through his body.He\u2019d never realized learning martial arts could be so fun.\u2018I guess that\u2019s obvious.\u2019In his previous life, he\u2019d only learned how to survive and kill. He\u2019d only gotten better at killing people through that.He did increase his aura and trained with killing swordsmanship. But that wasn\u2019t for the sake of improving himself. It was only of use in finishing off his enemies.He kept engraving the killing methods in his body and mind until his body was crushed and shattered.However, it was different now.The \u2018Seven Shaped Fist\u2019, the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019, and the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019 were all basic fist techniques, but his heart was filled with excitement just from learning them.\u2018Because I\u2019m improving for my sake.\u2019It wasn\u2019t for the sake of killing someone else or following someone else\u2019s orders. Since it was for his own sake, he could only smile despite it being difficult.\u2018And the pain is bearable.\u2019The pain was actually greater in his current life than in his previous life because of the ice in his mana circuit. However, he couldn\u2019t stop moving his body because of the exaltation that came from his improvement.The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 rotated violently to grasp the flow of martial arts and enhanced his body.Since he could feel his body and mind improving on top of his fist technique, his training was simply enjoyable.What are you going to do with those basic movements? If you offer your body, the King of Essence will make you the best in the continent immediately.\u2018It\u2019s pointless if it isn\u2019t by my own will.\u2019He\u2019d had enough of pointlessly following somebody else\u2019s order in his previous life. Becoming the strongest by offering up his body was useless to him.How foolish. A weakling like you can never be\u2026\u2018Hmph.\u2019Since he was feeling refreshed, he could laugh off Wrath\u2019s nonsense.Pang!Raon performed the different postures of the \u2018Thundering Fist\u2019, using Wrath\u2019s voice as the rhythm. He seemed to be learning the emotion of joy through his training.Whoosh! Whoosh!While he was catching his breath after swinging his fist with full force, one of the trainees approached him and bowed to him.\u201cE-excuse me, Mr. Top Student. May I ask a question?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m having trouble with the last posture of the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cMove your right foot out a bit further. Your stance isn\u2019t balanced.\u201dRaon figured out the problem as soon as he saw the trainee\u2019s posture.\u201cAh! Thank you!\u201dThe trainee bowed and stepped back. He looked like he understood it at once, since he managed to get the correct posture by fixing what Raon had commented on.\u201cWow, it\u2019s fixed at once!\u201d\u201cHe is a genius of the fist technique!\u201d\u201cI think he has better eyes than the instructors.\u201dThe trainees looked up to Raon with admiration after checking each other\u2019s posture.Raon didn\u2019t care whether the trainees were surprised or not. After training fist technique until the sun set, he returned to the dormitory.After finishing his simple dinner, he returned to his room and prepared to cultivate aura.The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 wasn\u2019t progressing as well as the fist technique, which he was quickly improving at, but Raon stayed composed.\u2018I already knew this was going to take a while.\u2019He\u2019d realized after checking through all the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 in his brain.The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was a legendary cultivation technique, at the same level as the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.If he could learn it properly, he was going to acquire an aura so powerful that it\u2019d be difficult to find a match. Therefore, it was normal that it\u2019d take a long time to acquire it.\u2018And I\u2019m also absorbing the ice.\u2019Raon was controlling the ice inside his mana circuit alongside the heat from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Since he was circulating two conflicting energies at once, it would\u2019ve been weird if they were easily accumulated in his energy center.\u2018I don\u2019t need to worry.\u2019It was true that his progress was slow for now.However, since he knew that the reward for acquiring the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 and absorbing all the ice would be tremendous, he didn\u2019t feel anxious at all.\u2018I\u2019m looking forward to the blossoming of the first flower.\u2019Imagining the single flower created from the flame of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, Raon closed his eyes and focused on cultivating.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Martha\u2019s training sword slashed through the fresh air. The sharp yet smooth sequence of strikes were a part of Zieghart\u2019s basic swordsmanship, the \u2018Combination Sword\u2019.Whoosh!She struck with her sword fiercely, as if she were in the middle of a battlefield. Not even the sand cloud rolling up in the training ground dared to approach her due to her intense spirit.Whoosh!From her right, a similar slashing sound could be heard. It was the blonde-haired, red-eyed boy, Raon Zieghart.His dull training sword was executing the steps of the \u2018Combination Sword\u2019, just like Martha.Raon, who used to be far behind her, had finally caught up.However, Martha didn\u2019t display any sign of anxiousness or nervousness, despite seeing that.Instead, she applauded Raon with a smile.\u201cYou are good.\u201dMartha swept up her disheveled hair, putting down her training sword.\u201cYou are learning martial arts so quickly that \u2018genius\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be enough to describe you. However\u2026\u201dShe twirled her finger while dragging out her words.\u201cWith your mediocre mana perception, that talent is nothing but a pearl to a swine. I\u2019m not really jealous of such a defective talent.\u201dMartha\u2019s voice was loud. Every trainee heard her, but none of them stepped up.\u201cIt\u2019s better to have half that talent in aura and martial arts. The best you can become with your talent is a swordsmanship instructor.\u201dThe trainees who\u2019d been helped by Raon, Burren, Rimmer, and the other instructors all remained silent.\u2018Of course they would.\u2019Martha sneered even harder.\u2018Nobody expected that dumbass to be unable to acquire an aura even after four months.\u2019It\u2019d already been over four months since aura training was included in regular training, but Raon still hadn\u2019t managed to acquire an aura, and his energy center was still empty.\u2018I was freaked out at first.\u2019She was really astonished watching Raon progress at a tremendous rate.She couldn\u2019t even sleep because of that dreadful talent chasing after her, and she couldn\u2019t get rid of that fear, despite training from daybreak until night.However, everything had changed after hearing what Camel had said.\u2018He really was defective.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a lie that Raon was shown to have the worst mana perception during the Judgment Ceremony.What\u2019s the point of being so good at learning swordsmanship and fist techniques if there was no power to incorporate into that fist and sword?\u201cHehe.\u201dMartha turned her head while laughing at Raon, who kept swinging his sword while dripping cold sweat.\u2018He isn\u2019t even worthy of my attention.\u2019She used to consider him as a threat, but she no longer did. Raon couldn\u2019t even match up to that coward Dorian, let alone Burren or Runaan.On the other hand, the fact that she\u2019d been counterattacked by Raon was still etched in her memory.\u2018I can forget about it now, since he will be no match for me in a duel using aura.\u2019With a laid-back smile, Martha turned around.\u201cHuh?\u201dRunaan Sullion was standing there with a blank expression on her face.\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cIs that all you want to say?\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going, even if you don\u2019t tell me to. It\u2019s time for me to do some more advanced training.\u201dShe waved her hand gently, then left the training ground.Whoosh!Despite Martha having mocked him so much, Raon didn\u2019t react. He kept swinging his sword while steam billowed from his mouth.The sword was the only thing reflected in his red pupil.***Raon looked around the indoor gymnasium after finishing his night training.\u2018Is everyone gone?\u2019Since the two next days were holidays, everyone had gone home. Nobody remained at the training ground.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dRaon let out an exhilarated breath and put down his sword. Since he\u2019d been only focusing on swordsmanship while using his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, he hadn\u2019t realized the night had already fallen.The concentration was on par with right before an assassination. It was difficult to have such extreme concentration during training.\u2018My swordsmanship got a lot better.\u2019His progress in the \u2018Combination Sword\u2019 was a lot higher, thanks to only being focused on the sword. It looked like it would soon become usable in a real battle without any issues.You\u2019ve finally come to your senses!!As he was feeling satisfied with his training, Wrath\u2019s angry voice rang out.You are such a pathetic guy, staying still after being taunted so much!\u2018Taunt?\u2019That black haired girl kept talking to you!\u2018Oh, really?\u2019Raon smirked. He hadn\u2019t realized Martha was talking, as he was too focused on training.If she had said such a thing to the King of Essence, I would\u2019ve frozen her whole then broken it into pieces!\u2018I already told you, there\u2019s nothing to gain from fighting her now.\u2019There would be nothing to gain by fighting her because of her provocation.It was much more preferable to make a bet later, with the title of top trainee at stake, in order to receive something like an elixir or a martial arts book.\u2018Since I can win, no matter what.\u2019Even if he didn\u2019t manage to learn the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, it would be easy to win against a greenhorn like Martha. The best time to fight her would be when she managed to get her hand on some worthy treasure.\u2018For now, I should return.\u2019As Raon was about to turn off the magical light in the training ground, he heard a quiet stepping sound from the door.Tap.Small and light steps. They belonged to Runaan, and he\u2019d gotten used to hearing them every day.When he turned around, Runaan was standing there with glittering purple eyes, rather than her usual blank expression.\u201cHere.\u201dShe extended the hand that she\u2019d been hiding behind her back. There was a box, a bit smaller than a brick.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dWithout responding, Runaan opened the lid. Under the cold steam that rose along with the lid, there was a bead at the size of a thumb.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dRaon looked back and forth between the bead inside the box and Runaan\u2019s purple eyes.\u201cDo you want me to take it?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded and put the bead in Raon\u2019s hand. He could feel a pleasant coolness on his hand.\u201cEat.\u201dShe spoke, then closed the lid.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019Raon couldn\u2019t tell what it was, but it was certainly something precious since it was stored in a box full of ice.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGiven the things he\u2019d learned during his life as an assassin, he shouldn\u2019t have eaten it. However, because Runaan's eyes were filled with expectation, his hand moved on its own.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *She wouldn\u2019t give him something bad, he thought.He closed his eyes and put the bead in his mouth. The bead melted as soon as it touched his tongue, and a cool and sweet taste\u2014like frozen chocolate\u2014spread throughout his mouth.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dHe was astonished by how cool and sweet it tasted.H-how can such a taste exist?! It\u2019s a sweetness that the King of Essence had never tasted, even in devildom! No, is it the coolness that made it even sweeter? More, bring more of it! I want to eat more!It looked like their senses were connected, since Wrath kept jumping up and down after eating the ice cream.\u2018Just stay still.\u2019As Wrath fluttered like a butterfly, Raon pushed him away with his elbow.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bead ice cream.\u201dRunaan nodded and stepped back. Then she left the training ground, just like that.\u201cHuh? Hey!\u201dDespite him gesturing to her and calling for her, she didn\u2019t look back.... What a strange girl. But it would\u2019ve been better if she gave me one more.\u2018Was she worried about me?\u2019It looked like she gave him the bead ice cream because she was worried about him being openly laughed at by Martha that day.He\u2019d occasionally eaten ice cream in the annex building, but it was his first time having it in that form and taste.Considering the size of the box, it must\u2019ve contained at most four beads, and it looked like she\u2019d given him the last one.\u2018She gave me the last one.\u2019Runaan liked sweet food, as befitting of her age.The last ice cream must\u2019ve been important to her, so giving it to him without hesitation must\u2019ve been a difficult decision.He could imagine Runaan hesitating with her saved snack in her hand.\u201cOh my.\u201dRaon snickered. He felt sorry for making such a child worry about him.\u2018But I\u2019m completely unaffected.\u2019It was true.His path was higher and more difficult than anyone else\u2019s, and the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation' was the guide that would allow him to walk his path more easily.There was no way such an excellent guide would lend him its strength easily. He had to be patient and wait.\u2018I should repay her later.\u2019Raon gently smiled and left the training ground. His tired steps had become as light as a feather.***\u201cOh my god! Young master Raon!\u201dWhen Raon opened the annex building\u2019s door and entered, Helen\u2014who was standing at the entrance\u2014approached him with round eyes.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cDid you say Raon is here?\u201dSylvia, who heard Helen\u2019s voice, kicked open the door and ran up to Raon to hug him.\u201cHow long has it been?! You haven't visited for months!\u201d\u201cWe saw each other last week.\u201dRaon pushed her back as she rubbed her cheek against his. Since weekend visits were allowed for official trainees, Sylvia had been visiting him every week.\u201cThose are two different things!\u201dFlailing her arms, Sylvia shook her head.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet, right? I\u2019ll have dinner prepared. Helen!\u201d\u201cYoung master, please wait for a moment.\u201dSylvia went to the kitchen with the maids. Judging from the smell, it looked like they were preparing a beef stew.How to say it.It was difficult to put it into words, but he felt comfortable whenever he came to the annex building. Maybe that\u2019s what a real home, something he\u2019d never had in his previous life, was supposed to feel like.\u201cPrepare it quickly! Raon must be hungry!\u201d\u201cI know! But the ingredients\u2026\u201d\u201cUse everything that\u2019s left for now!\u201dRaon headed to the bathroom, listening to the friendly sounds coming from the kitchen.***At daybreak in Raon\u2019s room, Judiel knelt with her head bowed.Raon tapped the paper in his hand, sitting at his bed. It was the same paper as the moonlight paper he\u2019d found in the lake last time.\u201cRaise your head.\u201dAt the dignified voice, Judiel trembled and raised her head.\u201cAny orders from the Central Martial Palace?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing special. There was an order to investigate more thoroughly when the young master began learning the fist and swordsmanship techniques so quickly, but it looks like they lost interest since the young master hasn\u2019t managed to develop an aura.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dRaon smiled. Since aura was the most important aspect for any warrior, it looked like they\u2019d lost interest in him, since he wasn\u2019t talented in it.\u201cHow about mother?\u201d\u201cThey seem less interested in Lady Sylvia as well. At this rate, there\u2019s a possibility that I\u2019ll be called back.\u201dOne might think that it was a good thing for her to be called back, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all.\u2018I can\u2019t use her anymore.\u2019Since that defeated the purpose of having made Judiel into a double agent, it wasn\u2019t a desirable course of action.\u201cBy\u2026 By any chance, did the young master purposely avoid acquiring an aura\u2026\u201dJudiel opened her trembling mouth.\u201cI wonder.\u201dInstead of answering, Raon just smiled. It was enough to make Judiel swallow.The fear of that day still dominated her.\u201cThank you for your work. You may go now.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dJudiel stood with trembling eyes. Rejoicing over the fact that she didn\u2019t have to go through the pain and fear anymore, she quickly opened the door and left.They\u2019re going to believe that you didn\u2019t learn aura on purpose.\u2018Using the atmosphere and the situation to my favor is also a strength.\u2019Raon tapped Wrath, who was hanging on his wrist. Judiel was going to misunderstand on her own and nurture her fear against him.You are so pathetic, struggling to learn an aura. Back in devildom, the King of Essence could perform any magic or martial art with his eyes closed once learned.\u2018I\u2019m so pathetic, indeed.\u2019Raon casually responded and left the room. Since he wasn\u2019t in a hurry, he could laugh off Wrath\u2019s contempt.\u201cHmm?\u201dAs he was about to go to the garden for the daylight training, a man approached him from a distance. The red-haired elf that brought around a pleasant wind was Rimmer.\u201cInstructor?\u201d\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201dRimmer waved his hand, hair its usual bird's nest.\u201cWhat brought you here at daybreak?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t keep my promise back then. I felt bad about it, so I figured I\u2019d help you out a bit.\u201d\u201cPromise?\u201d\u201cI ran away after promising to teach you the \u2018Advanced Rising Fist\u2019 on the first day of fist technique training.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s too late now for that, I\u2019ll teach you something else.\u201dHe grinned and flicked his finger. A dark green wind rose from the end of his long finger.\u201cI\u2019ll teach you about attribute.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29\u201cDid you just say you would teach me about attributes?\u201dRaon frowned, looking at Rimmer\u2019s disheveled hair and clothes. He didn\u2019t look trustworthy at all.\u201cYou look like you are looking at a scammer.\u201dRimmer giggled, bending forward slightly.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m pretty good at teaching, despite being a little bit lazy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat was true. His methods didn\u2019t help many children, but it at least guaranteed the development of the few.\u201cStop doubting me and come on.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t we doing it here?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Get ready quickly and come with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201dRaon went to his room and pulled out his outer garments.Today is an unlucky day, to see that pointy-eared bastard at daybreak.\u2018We see him every day, though.\u2019He left the annex building after he finished dressing.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cThe North Grave Mountain.\u201dRimmer pointed at the mountain soaring behind the annex building. It was a huge mountain surrounding the entire Zieghart estate, connected not only to the annex building, but also to the main building.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dFollowing Rimmer, Raon climbed the mountain.\u201cAround here seems good.\u201dRimmer stopped after about twenty minutes of climbing. The place looked like a vacant lot, since the ground was flat and there weren\u2019t any trees.\u201cWhy did we come here?\u201dRaon\u2019s voice was indifferent, but he was actually prepared to react to anything Rimmer was going to do.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so nervous. I just want you to feel it.\u201d\u201cFeel it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs Rimmer smiled, a dark green wind blew towards him.\u201cTrust me and stand still, right over there.\u201d\u201cEven if you tell me to trust you\u2026 hmm?\u201dHis bangs fluttered in the wind, which resembled a spring\u2019s fragrance as it brushed away winter.Next was a cool wind that could only be felt in a forest in the summer, fanning his heated body from the climb.The third was winter. A cold wind pressed against his skin, chilling to his bones like a storm.Then the wind changed one more time.The dark green wind, which contained the four seasons, became a sharp blade and surrounded Raon.\u201cUsing the wind, I wanted to create a blade that could protect my lord.\u201dFrom the waves of green wind, Rimmer\u2019s voice could be heard.Bam!It was a storm of blades that could rip apart anything nearby. However, Raon stepped neither backwards nor forwards.\u201cThis is the wind I\u2019ve chosen.\u201dRaon stood still and felt the green storm.Whoosh!The fierce wind\u2019s pressure disappeared, and Rimmer gave a sly smile.\u201cYou weren\u2019t scared?\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t planning to attack me. You also told me to not move.\u201d\u201cYou really aren\u2019t like a normal thirteen-year-old, no matter how hard I look.\u201dRimmer snickered and flicked his finger, causing the lingering wind to disappear completely.\u201cA cultivation technique with an affinity can be more powerful than other cultivation techniques, but it is also difficult to learn.\u201dFollowing his gentle voice, the wind waved\u2014like it was dancing.\u201cI could feel the wind from birth because I\u2019m an elf, but you\u2019re different. You\u2019re human. It must be even more difficult for you, as your mana circuit is filled with ice.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dRaon nodded. The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was a sophisticated technique, but it was even more difficult for him to learn because he was controlling an energy opposing the ice he\u2019d been born with.\u201cThere are different kinds of wind. It can be warm, cold, or sharp. I\u2019d wanted a sword of wind that could pierce through anything, and I achieved it.\u201dRimmer\u2019s expression was confident, rather than bitter, as he spoke of his now out-of-reach former achievements.\u201cYou must also find it. Try to form an image of the fire you\u2019ll have.\u201d\u201cAn image\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd in order to create that image, the most important thing is to feel that affinity.\u201d\u201cBut this is the north. It\u2019s difficult to find a proper flame unless I set the mountain on fire.\u201d\u201cIf you do that, then our heads will fly together.\u201dRimmer giggled, then waved his hand. A green wind appeared from his feet.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going this time?\u201d\u201cSince you felt the wind, let\u2019s go see the fire now.\u201d***Raon ran along the mountain trails, following Rimmer. After about twenty minutes of running, Rimmer started to slow down.A thick, heated haze was rising up from the cold forest, as if a hot wind had passed through. The change in temperature was making him itchy.\u2018Is it coming from there?\u2019There was a gray kiln attached to a house made of red bricks. The heat was coming from the kiln.\u2018It\u2019s hot.\u2019The north was the coldest place on the continent, yet he felt hot. That was how much heat was emitting.\u201cHey, old man. I\u2019m here!\u201dRimmer strode ahead as if it were his own home and Raon followed behind.The heat grew stronger the closer they got to the kiln. His clothes started to become drenched in sweat.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe ice in his mana circuit was trembling because of the unfamiliar heat. Raon frowned at the worsening pain and entered the house.There was only one appliance inside the house.A furnace. It was the furnace from the kiln, which was emitting enough heat to make the whole house look distorted.A wrinkled old man with completely white hair was sitting in front of the furnace. Despite being completely drenched in sweat, he wasn\u2019t taking his eyes off it.\u2018Is this really the flame that I used to know?\u2019Raon swallowed. He\u2019d seen many flames throughout his previous life, from the bonfire he\u2019d made himself to the advanced fire magic used by a mage.However, none of those seemed to match up to the heat created by the flame soaring in the furnace.Swoosh!The ice in his mana circuit started to scream, and the mana around him started to move\u2014following the flow of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, which he hadn\u2019t even acquired yet.The sound of a soaring flame reverberated through his ears, and the waves of heat made his heartbeat fiercer. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the furnace, as if he were bewitched by it.\u201cOld man, you\u2019re always so focused.\u201dRimmer dusted off his hand after soothing the heat with his green wind.\u201cThe heat is dying down because of you!\u201d\u201cIt looks like another failure anyway.\u201d\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dAfter glaring at Rimmer, the old man sighed and threw an unknown gray mass inside the furnace.Whish.The intense heat, hot enough to melt the ground, was subdued. The flame grew weaker, to the point that it merely felt warm.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaon unconsciously sighed. As soon as the flame disappeared, the flow of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019 running through his mana circuit dissipated. The regret made his fingers tremble.\u201cWhat did you bring today? What is that thing?\u201dThe old man frowned, looking at Raon. The lowered corners of his lips and raised eyebrows showed his stubborn personality.\u201cWow! \u2018That thing\u2019? How dare you address the head of house\u2019s grandson like that!\u201dRimmer was preaching about manners, despite always talking however he felt.\u201cHmph. I\u2019m just a retired old man. Unless the head of house comes personally\u2026 Hmm?\u201dHe started to stand up, then stopped after seeing Raon\u2019s eyes and hair.\u201cBlond and red eyes? And that face\u2026\u201d\u201cHe looks like the head of house, right? Raon looks a lot more handsome, though.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe old man nodded in agreement.\u201cI\u2019m Vulcan. You should leave if you are expecting manners from me.\u201d\u2018Vulcan!\u2019Raon controlled his expression, looking at the old man\u2019s blurred eyes\u2014it was as if he was looking at burned out coal.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect him to be here.\u2019He was a blacksmith, renowned throughout the world under the title of the Continent\u2019s Blacksmith. He was famous for having forged Glenn Zieghart\u2019s True Heavenly Sword.However, his last known activity was thirty years ago, and he hadn\u2019t created another famous sword since the True Heavenly Sword.\u201cI\u2019m Raon Zieghart.\u201dRaon bowed, without minding Vulcan\u2019s manners. It was his way of showing respect to a giant who\u2019d reached the end of a road.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dVulcan\u2019s disgruntled expression softened slightly at his polite greeting.\u201cDid you tell him about\u2026?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dRimmer shook his head, then turned around.\u201cThis old man is Zieghart\u2019s blacksmith.\u201d\u201cRetired.\u201d\u201cYes, retired blacksmith. Anyway, he\u2019s been igniting flames here for over ten years now.\u201dRimmer turned, pointing at the now extinguished furnace.\u201cThis is where you can feel the hottest and fiercest flame in the North.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cA cultivation technique for fire attributes, huh\u2026\u201dVulcan frowned after hearing Rimmer\u2019s explanation.\u201cIs that why you brought him here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re managing the fire here throughout the year. There\u2019s no other place where you can feel a proper flame.\u201d\u201cHow about the blacksmiths\u2019 workshop?\u201d\u201cThat place stands out too much. Being noticed before learning that cultivation technique won\u2019t do him any good.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cBecause Raon is Sylvia\u2019s son.\u201dUpon hearing that he was Sylvia\u2019s son, Vulcan\u2019s eyes skimmed over Raon once again.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dHe turned around and watched the orange flame. He looked like he was considering it.\u201cI won\u2019t disturb you. Please allow me to feel the fire.\u201dRaon bowed to Vulcan once more.\u2018I want to see it again.\u2019Vulcan\u2019s flame made his heart beat harder and his mana circuit waver. He wanted to feel the breath of that flame once again.\u201cI\u2019m just making charcoal.\u201d\u201cCharcoal?\u201d\u201cA golden charcoal that can generate a much more powerful heat than white or black charcoal. If you aren\u2019t going to disturb me making golden charcoal, I don\u2019t care what you do.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon bowed once again. Vulcan turned his head, embarrassed by Raon\u2019s increasing courtesy.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that he accepted. Raon, cultivate the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 here during daybreak training. Since nobody lives around here, and this old man doesn\u2019t know about cultivation techniques, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRaon nodded. Just as Rimmer said, he couldn\u2019t feel any mana from Vulcan.\u201cOld man, we need to talk.\u201dRimmer led Vulcan out of the house, pleased that everything was going well.\u201cYou\u2019re still as kind as ever, old man.\u201dRimmer grinned, his arm resting on Vulcan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI\u2019ll bring you some good stuff if you take good care of Raon. Do you like fruit wines?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe flame in the furnace burst when that boy arrived, to a point that the coals were ruined because of it.\u201dVulcan furrowed his eyebrows, looking at the yellow, burned-out coal.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I last got this color.\u201d\u201cSo, the old man felt it too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a blacksmith. The flame that I\u2019ve been seeing my entire life wavered. There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201dVulcan\u2019s gray eyes, the color of burned-out ashes, shone.\u201cThe boy\u2019s breath contains the power to move a flame.\u201d***The next morning, Raon ran towards Vulcan\u2019s charcoal kiln before sunrise. Thanks to the red heat rising up in the dark mountain, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find the charcoal kiln.Despite hearing Raon\u2019s footsteps, Vulcan kept watching the furnace instead of looking at him.The sight of him keeping his eyes on the furnace, despite sweating so heavily, emphasized the fact that he didn\u2019t gain the title of the Continent\u2019s Blacksmith for nothing.\u2018This heat\u2026\u2019Raon stood where the heat was the strongest.The intense wave of heat rolled up his clothes and flared up his skin. The ice frantically started to stab his mana circuit.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dHe grit his teeth against the incoming pain, gray steam leaving his mouth.It was so painful that he wanted to run away immediately, but his heartbeat was raging with excitement from the flame.He was exhilarated. Following the breath of fire that he felt through the pain, he recited the fundamentals of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019.The hot breath was added to the inhaled mana, and the cloudy air was exhaled from his body.Raon closed his eyes. He rotated the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and practiced the\u2019 Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Whoosh.When he reached the peak of his concentration, the pain disappeared and the exhilaration from the heat filled his heart.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dVulcan turned around. The movements of his hands gentled as he watched Raon breathe with his eyes closed.Crackle.The sound of burning wood crackled from the furnace.***Three months had passed since Raon started to cultivate aura at Vulcan\u2019s charcoal kiln.Since he\u2019d gotten used to it, he could now reach the charcoal kiln in ten minutes.The flame, which had become even fiercer than the first time he\u2019d seen, was pressing down on the place. The kiln\u2019s surroundings were filled with heat ripples the size of a finger.\u2018He doesn\u2019t change.\u2019Vulcan didn\u2019t turn around or speak, despite knowing that he\u2019d arrived. He just focused on watching the furnace.Raon approached the furnace, trying to not make a sound.Each time he took a step towards the furnace, heated air surrounded his entire body.It was difficult to breathe, and his back was drenched in sweat. The ice in his mana circuit growled like the jaws of a savage beast.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dIt was a pain he couldn\u2019t get used to, but Raon smiled. Looking at the flame was now enough to make him excited.\u2018Fire\u2026\u2019He\u2019d started to understand.After spending time alongside the fire and following Rimmer\u2019s advice, he could finally understand what fire\u00a0was.People said fire was the scariest and the strongest attribute, but it was the most stable of all attributes if handled properly.Raon took one more step towards it, while feeling the heat scorching his skin.The energy from his not-yet-acquired \u2018Ten Thousand Flames\u2019 Technique woke by itself, attracting the heat that was scorching the earth.The flame inside the furnace burst up like a devil\u2019s tongue, as if it was reacting to the mana.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled the remaining air from his lung and took in the well-baked mana.He guided the boiling mana towards his mana circuit. The ice trying to run away from the heat, followed the flow of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, and dragged it into the energy center.\u2018An image.\u2019Once the cultivation stabilized, Raon remembered Rimmer\u2019s advice. He\u2019d told him he needed to draw an image.\u2018The fire I need\u2026\u2019He thought about his objective.It was to make Sylvia a part of the direct line once again, and to cut Derus Robert\u2019s head off. It was going to be as difficult as walking through darkness, where he couldn\u2019t see anything.He needed a flame that could become a torch to illuminate his way, a flame that could become a sword to defeat savage beasts.He needed a flame that wouldn\u2019t extinguish, even if it snowed or rained. A flame that didn\u2019t extinguish, no matter what. That was the flame he chose.As he drew the clear image of his flame, lightning struck his mind and his heart throbbed with life.The mana circuit repeated its expansion and contraction, stimulating the frozen ice.Heat that was running wild, like lava melting the glacier, ran through his mana circuit and finally reached his energy center.Whoosh!The moment the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was being condensed into a sphere of aura, a frightening voice resounded in his mind.It\u2019s the King of Essence\u2019s time to shine.Spine-chilling goosebumps appeared up Raon\u2019s back, despite his trance.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Clench!Raon grit his teeth.\u2018Wrath!\u2019As he was interrupted just before forming an aura in his trace, the aura started to scatter.\u2018Grr!\u2019Raon focused and tried to condense the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 as it began to dissipate. Just as he was about to force it to settle, a coldness rushed at him.I told you.Wrath\u2019s voice was jeered at him.The King of Essence will target you when you are in your weakest state.\u2018Grr\u2026\u2019He was right.Wrath did warn him that he would attack at the most dangerous moment. To be honest, Raon had somewhat expected it to happen.However, he completely forgot about Wrath while in his trance.I\u2019m only getting started!Wrath exploded his massive coldness, aimed at him. Raon shivered, facing the coldness that seemed to even freeze his cold sweat.He wanted to open his eyes immediately because of the bone-freezing pain. However, he couldn\u2019t do that. It risked reversing the flow of his mana, which would incapacitate him.\u2018You bastard\u2026\u2019He forgot, since Wrath had been tamed for a while, that he wasn\u2019t his ally. He wasn\u2019t just a devil, but a king of devildom. He seemed to be trying to eat away his entire soul by breaking his body.Whirl!As Wrath\u2019s coldness grew more powerful, the ice in his mana circuit started to reverberate.\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019He groaned in pain. It felt like his skin and bones were being split apart. The extreme coldness and wrath started to corrode his mind.It\u2019s over.Wrath\u2019s cold voice contained exhilaration instead of anger.Your body and mind now belong to the King of Essence.Just as he said, Raon\u2019s whole body was being filled with that extreme cold. He was losing his senses due to the extreme pain, and he felt like he would faint at any moment.\u2018Grr!\u2019Raon bit his tongue. The pain allowed him to regain his senses for an instant, like a bucket of cold water.\u2018Think, think!\u2019Wrath\u2019s coldness had already covered his entire body. He could take control of it at any moment now.\u2018I can\u2019t stop the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.\u2019It was too late to use the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, since Wrath\u2019s coldness was going to engulf his body and mind before the ring started to rotate.\u2018I need to reach a breakthrough.\u2019Raon tried to withstand it by circulating the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019. It was a precarious situation, like hanging over a cliff with a single rope.Just give up. Your body is already mine.\u2018We won\u2019t know until I try.\u2019It\u2019s an unnecessary struggle, like that old man who ignites the charcoal kiln every day.\u2018Charcoal kiln\u2026 Charcoal kiln!\u2019There was a way that he could survive.Clench!Raon clenched his fist and gathered the mana with all his remaining power.Whoosh!The mana flowing into him wasn't nature's mana, heated up by the charcoal kiln, but the mana inside the kiln itself.Bastard! What are you doing?!\u2018Last-ditch struggle!\u2019Yes, it was a last-ditch struggle. He\u2019d gotten enough of dying without being able to do anything in his previous life. He didn\u2019t want to die in vain in his current life, no matter what.Rustle!From the ceiling of the charcoal kiln, covered in stiff clay, a rustling sound of leaves could be heard.You bastard! Stop it!\u2018Ugh!\u2019The coldness from Wrath grew stronger, powerful enough to freeze to his bones. Despite being unable to feel anything in his limbs, he withstood it with the very last of his strength and inhaled for the last time.Crack!With an earth-shattering sound, a tremendous heat burst into the air. Flame was bursting out from inside the charcoal kiln.Huff!Raon instantly inhaled the heat, as if he\u2019d never taken a breath before.The heat was inhaled not only through his nose and mouth, but the pores of his skin. His entire body pushed back the coldness. It was an overwhelming power, like lava running through his veins.Whap!Wrath\u2019s coldness vanished like a spring snow facing the turbulent waves of heat.Wh-what is this?!\u2018Wrath, disappear!\u2019Raon kept controlling the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, chewing his lip. He also rounded up the tremendous amount of ice that his mana circuit had melted down, guiding it towards his energy center.Whoosh!The energy of \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, which used to be like a dying flame, formed into a clear shape upon taking in the heat from the charcoal kiln.Whir!And that wasn\u2019t all.A pure white energy was condensed like a bead, right next to the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, taking a clear shape. It was the ice of the Frost that used to fill his mana circuit.Da-damn it!\u2018Huff\u2026\u2019Without paying attention to Wrath screaming in anger, Raon organized all the heat in the air and the ice inside his body.It took extreme concentration. Withstanding Wrath\u2019s interruption, Raon fell into a second trance.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHa!\u201dVulcan breathed out heavily, placing a piece of firewood in the furnace.Watching the furnace, where the firewood was immediately set ablaze, he recalled the past.\u2018It\u2019s already been thirty years.\u2019It had been thirty years since he made his last masterpiece, the True Heavenly Sword. After offering the best sword of his life to Glenn Zieghart, he thought his journey had come to an end.Since he\u2019d obtained so much wealth, the kind that wouldn\u2019t run out for the rest of his life, he decided to retire and enjoy the rest of his life.However, he was sitting in front of the fire when he came to his senses.He didn\u2019t need to wake up early, nor ignite the furnace. And yet, he kept heading towards the blacksmith.\u2018I am absolutely stuck.\u2019He was still stuck in the moment that he\u2019d created the True Heavenly Sword.\u2018I can\u2019t stop it.\u2019He\u2019d created countless swords and contributed greatly to Zieghart. Its leader\u2014Glenn Zieghart, one of the strongest of the continent\u2014was using his sword.Although his name would be passed down in history even if he retired, he couldn\u2019t sit still. He couldn\u2019t stop holding his hammer, nor stay away from the fire.There was only one reason that he was hesitating so much.Even though he wanted to keep working, he wasn\u2019t confident in creating something that would surpass the True Heavenly Sword that he\u2019d offered Glenn.In his indecision, he ignited a sloppy fire and used his hammer.All he could feel was emptiness.\u2018That\u2019s why I made this kiln.\u2019About ten years ago, he\u2019d started creating coals from the charcoal kiln in order to create golden charcoal, which surpassed black and white charcoal.He thought he could possibly create a better sword if he had that special charcoal.However, he never succeeded, not even once.Collecting legends and rumors, he tried countless methods. However, he couldn\u2019t obtain the golden charcoal.He didn\u2019t want to give up. It was the only obsession left in the final days of his life.While he was burning away his time, that boy came to visit him.Raon Zieghart.He\u2019d been breathing with the furnace\u2019s flame from the day he\u2019d met him. The flame that had been stopped for decades started to burn like a savage beast.It was the first time.The flame had never reacted, nor had it ever increased its firepower before.Thinking that something might change, he\u2019d allowed Raon to stay next to him. However, he didn\u2019t have high expectations.\u2018Because this is a hellfire.\u2019The kiln\u2019s heat was so severe that even a veteran blacksmith avoided it. Some blacksmiths had come to him with the intention of helping, but a few days was enough to make them slip away.The boy was drenched in cold sweat and withstood the pain by biting his lip. However, he kept visiting him every day and sat in front of the furnace.At first, he was clearly unable to focus on his cultivation because of the heat coming from the ground. The second day was the same, he kept biting his lip while trembling from the heat.Three days, four days, a week, a month, three months.Raon kept visiting the kiln without missing a single day.And today.The fire inside the furnace burned fiercely, as if it was reacting to Raon breathing in and out, and the heat inside the kiln had become many times stronger.Inhale!He dominated the flame in that space, as if he\u2019d become the embodiment of the fire.\u2018This is\u2014!\u2019Vulcan suddenly realized it was an important opportunity for him. Not an opportunity to create a new charcoal, but an opportunity for him to live as a blacksmith once again.\u201cHuff!\u201dWith extreme concentration, he maintained the firepower in the furnace. Blowing and fanning, he kept repeating every action that could grow the fire.The flame was alive.The transparent flame at the center was increasing its firepower while erasing the weak and murky ones.However, something unexpected happened.Frost fell from Raon\u2019s body, which should\u2019ve been sweating from the charcoal kiln\u2019s heat.\u2018What is this?\u2019He looked around in a panic, but the ice was nowhere else to be found.That ice kept spreading throughout his body, and his golden hair ended up freezing.\u2018Wh-what should I do?\u2019Raon\u2019s body was trembling. He understood he wasn\u2019t in a good condition, but he didn\u2019t know what to do.He knew he shouldn\u2019t touch him at a time like this, but he thought Raon would die if left alone.\u201cH-hey! You\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dAs Vulcan was about to extend his hand in order to wake Raon up, Rimmer appeared. He was literally moving like the wind.\u201cRimmer! What are you doing?! He is going to die!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do right now.\u201dRimmer shook his head. He frowned and stared at Raon, who was shaking even more now.\u201cIf he receives the slightest impact from the outside, he will cough up blood and die.\u201d\u201cIs that the ice you talked about before?\u201d\u201cYes. He was born with that ice in his body.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dVulcan bit his lip as the sight tugged at his heartstrings.\u2018Such a young child\u2026\u2019He felt sorry that a child still wet behind the ears was born with a coldness severe enough to erase the furnace\u2019s heat. At the same time, he felt proud of the boy that had managed to withstand it until now.He wanted to help somehow.\u201cIs there anything we can do?\u201d\u201cNo. It will be dangerous if you touch anything at all.\u201dRimmer\u2019s expression was unusually serious. His fist was clenched, and his eyes didn\u2019t move away from Raon.The two of them kept staring at the ice covering Raon\u2019s entire body in complete silence.\u201cHe\u2026 He is really going to die at this rate! Anything!\u201d\u201cWait! Raon just moved!\u201dRimmer\u2019s expression contained hope. He snorted as he kept staring at Raon.\u201cWhat? What do you mean\u2026 huh?\u201dVulcan turned his head. The flame from the furnace had suddenly grown fiercer.Rumble!The flame came from the furnace, surging around the entire kiln. The kiln\u2019s clay enclosure had exploded, causing the tremendous heat to fill the air.Boom!It was difficult to breathe due to the immense heat.\u201cHuff!\u201dHe lowered his body because of the heat, the type of which the Continent\u2019s Blacksmith had never felt before, but the heat didn\u2019t last.Whoosh!That was because the heat was being absorbed by Raon, rotating in a spiral towards him. With the tremendous amount of heat being condensed into him, the coldness covering his entire body melted.Whap!A red flame burned along Raon\u2019s body. No, the flame wasn\u2019t red.It was golden.Reflecting the golden daybreak rising over the eastern mountain, a golden flame burst forth.Despite being engulfed in a golden flame, Raon didn\u2019t stop cultivating. He kept absorbing the heat from not only his surroundings, but also the entirety of the North Grave Mountain.Rumble!As the sun fully showed its majestic light, the light pouring out from Raon started to grow faint and he opened his eyes.Spark!Vulcan, who met his eyes, swallowed. A thrill running up from his toes pierced his brain.A dark golden light.The golden light, containing the daybreak\u2019s light, was burning in his eyes.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Raon slowly opened his eyes. He smiled at the hot energy rooted firmly in his energy center.\u2018Finally.\u2019He managed to create an aura with the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, piercing through Wrath\u2019s fierce sabotage. Moreover, the chunk of aura was a lot bigger and more straightforward than he\u2019d expected.\u2018And there\u2019s more than the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.\u2019Next to the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, which resembled lava pressed into a rounded shape, there was a lump of ice similar to the northern ocean\u2019s glaciers.It was the result of a coincidence that occurred while he was pushing back Wrath\u2019s cold fire with the heat from the charcoal kiln.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect that misfortune to turn into a blessing like this.\u2019The aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was over twice the size that he expected, and the aura of ice formed next to it.It was a great reward, exceeding his expectations, for enduring such terrible pain and putting his life at stake.\u201cHaa.\u201dCalming his pounding heart, Raon looked at the message that appeared in front of him.[You have acquired the 'Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation'.][Trait 'Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation (One-Star)' has been created.]['Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation' has reached two-star after receiving a powerful heat.]['Fire Resistance (Two-Star)' has been created with the effect from the 'Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation (Two-Stars)'.]They were messages stating that the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 reached two-star as soon as it was created.\u2018I knew that would happen.\u2019Since the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 that settled in his energy center was a lot bigger than expected, he\u2019d figured it had reached two-stars in one go.\u2018I can blossom the flower right away.\u2019The flower of fire could be used once the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 reached the Two-Stars rank, and he felt like he could already use it.When Raon smiled in anticipation, a second set of messages appeared.[Two strands of the 'Curse of Frost' have been melted down.][The state 'Poor Stamina' has disappeared.][The melted ice has condensed to form the trait 'Coldness of Frost'.][After receiving the powerful coldness from 'Wrath', the 'Coldness of Frost' has reached Two-Stars.]\u201cOoh.\u201dAn exclamation burst from him.The notice about the two strands of the curse melting down and the poor stamina state disappearing were amazing on their own, but the most important part was below those messages.The message stating that the ice inside his mana circuit had been condensed into a trait called \u2018Coldness of Frost\u2019\u2026 It had to be referring to the aura of ice located next to the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.\u2018Ice\u2026\u2019He had actually just been trying to raise his water resistance by taking in his mana circuit\u2019s ice instead of expelling it.The unexpected reward, the \u2018Coldness of Frost\u2019, felt good\u2014but it was also bewildering.Before he could fully comprehend all the messages, a third set of messages appeared.[You have withstood an interruption from 'Wrath' at a critical moment.][All stats have increased by 3 as a reward for displaying extreme willpower.]His stats raised at the same time the message appeared. He was exhilarated as his body and mind expanded and contracted.\u2018Is this a dream?\u2019He\u2019d only been trying to acquire the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, yet he managed to raise it to Two-Stars, along with Two-Stars of ice and extra stats.Thanks to Wrath\u2019s interruption, he managed to obtain skills he would\u2019ve needed to train for several years to otherwise receive.God damn it!When Raon smiled as he closed the messages, Wrath\u2019s suppressed voice burst out.What the hell are you?! How could you overcome that?!His dignified way of speaking was no longer there. Wrath was literally bursting with wrath.\u2018I told you. You are no match for me. It won\u2019t work, no matter what you do.\u2019Raon bluffed and waved his hand.No way! There\u2019s no way this can happen! Even back in devildom, the King of Essence never experienced such humiliation. How could this happen\u2026?\u2018Just give up already.\u2019Despite acting composed, he had really thought he was going to die. He\u2019d only managed to survive because he had read the surrounding energy during the three months he\u2019d been visiting the charcoal kiln.\u2018I have to be more careful.\u2019It had become certain. They\u2019d gotten a bit closer, but Wrath was clearly his enemy. He couldn\u2019t afford to reveal his weaknesses or secrets to him, no matter what.\u201cAre\u2026 Are you okay?\u201dAs Wrath trembled, Vulcan approached him. His eyes were wide enough that they looked like they might roll from his head.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dRaon raised his body. His body had grown as light as a feather with his increased stats and the two types of auras that he\u2019d obtained.\u201cThen\u2026 Have you acquired it?\u201dVulcan\u2019s lips were still trembling as he spoke in a low voice.\u201cYes, thanks to you.\u201dHe gave a deep nod. Thanks to the auras created in his energy center, he was full of energy.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. The kiln was broken because of me.\u201dRaon pointed towards the collapsed kiln. It was his fault that the sturdy charcoal kiln was in that state.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dAs he bowed low to apologize, Vulcan tapped his shoulder and approached the kiln.\u201cIf you are okay, then that\u2019s fine. Something like a charcoal kiln can be just remade\u2026 hmm?\u201dVulcan\u2019s eyes widened as he examined the collapsed charcoal kiln.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dAfter rummaging through the collapsed charcoal kiln, he picked up three pieces of charcoal with his tongs, each a shining gold color.\u2018What is that?\u2019He\u2019d seen white and black charcoal before, but he\u2019d never seen charcoal shining like gold like that.\u201cAh!\u201dHe remembered. Vulcan had told him he was trying to create golden charcoal instead of white or black charcoal. The golden light appeared to be the golden charcoal he mentioned.\u201cIt looks like you weren\u2019t the only one to have a strange turn of events occur.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cThis is golden charcoal. It is a blacksmith\u2019s charcoal with higher heat than white charcoal, and higher durability than black charcoal.\u201dVulcan placed the charcoal, which was emitting a golden heat, on top of a steel plate.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to make this charcoal for over ten years now, but ended up succeeding like this\u2026 Life really is full of surprises.\u201dHe watched the golden charcoal with ecstasy on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you. Thank you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t really do anything.\u201d\u201cWhenever you cultivated, the flame inside the kiln jolted, and your breath brought life to the flame. I\u2019m an idiot who\u2019s only used a hammer in my entire life, but I can tell what you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201dWhen Raon was about to tell him he didn\u2019t really do anything, Vulcan continued.\u201cWhat is your goal?\u201d\u201cGoal?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t answer immediately. He wasn\u2019t sure why Vulcan was asking that question, but his serious gaze suggested that he should respond.\u2018My goal\u2026\u2019As he\u2019d resolved during his cultivation, the end of his journey led to revenge against Derus. However, his priority at the moment was Sylvia. He wanted her to be happy.And to achieve that\u2026Rather than a brutally powerful strength, he needed a strength that wouldn\u2019t waver or lose in any situation.It was the same line of thoughts as the undying flame that he\u2019d created as his fire\u2019s image.\u201cI want to become a swordsman who won\u2019t be defeated by anyone, or any situation.\u201d\u201cNever defeated? It\u2019s not something a brat should say.\u201dVulcan snickered. It looked like a pleased smile, rather than mockery.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dHe called his name for the first time. It seemed to be his way of giving recognition.\u201cHow long do you have until you get your personal sword?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I think it\u2019ll take about three to five years.\u201dIn order to obtain a personal sword instead of the sword supplied by Zieghart, he had to finish the basic training and pass the swordsmanship test, which usually took about three to five years.\u201cI see.\u201dVulcan murmured that he should be able to endure that much.\u201cOnce you\u2019ve obtained an undefeated mind, come and visit me. I\u2019ll save these for that day.\u201dVulcan carefully shook the golden charcoal on the steel plate.\u201cDo you mean you will forge a sword for me? Aren\u2019t you retired?\u201d\u201cChanging your mind after retirement happens pretty often.\u201dHe smiled cheerfully. It looked like his wrinkles, which used to be filled with exhaustion and vanity when he\u2019d first visited him, were now full of vigor.\u201cDon\u2019t die.\u201dVulcan waved his hand lightly and went down the mountain. It was such a simple goodbye, considering they\u2019d been seeing each other so often over the last three months, but it did suit him.\u201cHmm.\u201dVulcan\u2019s back, which could be seen under the sunlight, looked thirty years younger than the first time he\u2019d seen him.\u2018Everything went well in the end.\u2019When Raon opened his hand, a red flame ignited like a snake\u2019s tongue. It was the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.He didn\u2019t even need to control it since he\u2019d gotten it to Two-Stars immediately. The flame from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was following his will perfectly.Whap.When he closed his hand, the flame disappeared. Only a slight heat remained.\u2018And now\u2026 hmm?\u2019Just as he was about to draw on the \u2018Coldness of Frost\u2019, he felt a small presence from above the tree to the right.It was so small that it could be easily mistaken as a bird or a small animal from the mountain, but Raon already knew who it was.\u201cPlease come out.\u201dRaon dusted off his hands while looking at the tree. He stayed still with a fixated gaze on his face. Rimmer dropped from the tree like a monkey, as if nothing had happened.\u201cHeh. You were aware?\u201dHe smiled awkwardly while scratching the back of his head.\u201cI realized it a little bit ago.\u201d\u201cTsk, so that was it. I was surprised to see the fire.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue. His green eyes were still full of surprise.\u201cHave you been watching me all along?\u201d\u201cNo, today is the first time.\u201dHe was smiling, but he wasn\u2019t as composed as always. He looked like a child who had been caught lying.\u2018I guess that would be normal.\u2019Rimmer wasn\u2019t a harsh person that would stop caring about him after bringing him to such a place. It looked like he\u2019d been watching over him for the past three months.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dRaon bowed.\u201cI told you it\u2019s not\u2014oh my.\u201dRimmer looked away while scratching his head.\u2018He is peculiar.\u2019He wasn\u2019t happy about receiving gratitude, but was embarrassed instead. The elf also looked far from normal.\u201cIt was a bit late, but you\u2019ve got an aura. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly late, though.\u201dRaon displayed a red flame on the tip of his finger. Rimmer frowned upon seeing it.\u201cHow can you use the aura as soon as you\u2019ve created it\u2026?\u201dHe sighed with a fed-up expression.\u201cIsn\u2019t this normal?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing someone using aura right after acquiring it.\u201dRimmer murmured that it usually took anywhere from one week to one month to skillfully use one\u2019s aura.\u201cGo down the mountain now, you need to arrive before training starts.\u201dRimmer tapped his shoulder and smiled.\u201cHow about the instructor?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to clean that up before arriving.\u201dHe pointed towards the collapsed charcoal kiln. The fire was gone, but the heat remained.\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201dRimmer shook his head and grabbed Raon, who was about to turn around.\u201cI\u2019m an instructor, so it\u2019s okay for me to be late. But a trainee shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s expression was asking him \u2018what kind of bullshit is that?\u2019, but Rimmer ignored him as he fanned himself with his hand.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll follow after cleaning up, so head down now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alright. Thank you.\u201dAfter bowing once again, he went down the mountain.\u201cHaaah.\u201dAfter making sure that Raon was gone, Rimmer looked at the charcoal kiln. Since Vulcan had designed it to not spread the fire, he didn\u2019t need to touch it.The reason he stayed wasn\u2019t because of the kiln.\u201cPlease come out now.\u201dHe called out, just as Raon had called him.The air silently wavered, and a blond old man in long black clothes came down. Glenn Zieghart.\u201cHow was the spectacle?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn silently looked at the collapsed charcoal kiln, and the place that Raon used to sit.\u201cMy lord must be feeling a bit more assured now, since you\u2019ve been visiting every day and worrying about your grandson.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never done such a thing.\u201dHe shook his head and raised his finger.Whoosh!The remains of the collapsed kiln gathered in one spot, following Glenn\u2019s signal.Boom!The remains tangled with each other like rose vines and compressed, then disappeared in an instant.If not for the traces of burns on the ground, nobody would\u2019ve imagined there used to be a kiln there. It was an extraordinarily skillful handling of aura.\u201cThe quantity and purity of that aura is outrageous, probably because he absorbed all the heat from the charcoal kiln. Moreover, he started using it immediately after stabilizing it. It\u2019s an amazing talent.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201dGlenn closed his eyes, looking towards the forest road that Raon went down.\u201cHe even made his restraints his power.\u201d***In the south of Zieghart there was a town where lights never went out. A town of blacksmiths, it was Mirtan village, where blacksmiths struck with their hammers day and night.A round shaped forge was located at the deepest part of the town. The smithy that had been dark for over ten years had finally lit up.\u201cWhat?! The previous village chief\u2019s smithy has lit up!\u201d\u201cThe village chief, no, the previous village chief has returned!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s returned? But he\u2019s already retired!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t that old man return to his hometown?\u201dBlacksmiths, whether they were working, sleeping, or about to head out, flocked towards the forge.And they asked why he came back.\u201cI promised.\u201dVulcan, the previous chief of Mirtan village and the legendary blacksmith, dusted off the smithy.\u201cI have to prepare my body until that day comes.\u201dHe smiled pleasantly as he raised his hammer, igniting a fire.\u201cI need to create a sword to surpass the True Heavenly Sword.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Raon\u2019s footsteps were lighter than ever as he made his way towards the training ground. It wasn\u2019t just an impression\u2014his body had actually become lighter, as if he were riding the wind.\u2018It\u2019s thanks to the aura.\u2019The increased stats and change in his constitution were one of the reasons, but aura was making the biggest difference.Aura was an accumulation of mana. It could increase a human\u2019s physical abilities just by existing.Since Raon had two types of auras sitting together in his energy center, it was obvious he felt light and energetic.\u2018And there\u2019s more.\u2019His perception had become sharper.Flow of the wind, footsteps of animals in the mountain, and the presence of swordsman standing guard under the mountain\u2014he felt like he could grasp his entire surroundings in the palm of his hand.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon licked his lips.\u2018I want to test it out.\u2019Before using it in an actual battle, he wanted to understand exactly how much ability he currently had.\u2018I should go to the mountain again after today\u2019s training.\u2019The vacant lot where Rimmer had taught him about the wind last time seemed to be a good place to test it.Grrrrr!As Raon made his way towards the training ground, smiling with anticipation, Wrath screamed.Damn it!He was exuding icy violence and rage. Although he was obviously not scary, as he didn\u2019t have any power left.How could you notice the kiln at that moment?!\u2018I wonder, I must\u2019ve been lucky.\u2019My arse! Did you think I didn\u2019t realize you pulled it in?Wrath kept grinding his teeth.\u2018This guy is a monster!\u2019He\u2019d expected Raon Zieghart to be capable of blocking the ice and mental attacks.\u2018I thought it didn\u2019t matter what he could do.\u2019He believed he could eat up his body and mind soon enough, like he\u2019d always done.\u2018But it did.\u2019He was different.He waited for the moment the human\u2019s mind was at its weakest: the trance upon reaching the end of his cultivation, when his mental barriers were at their most fragile.Despite expelling all his wrathful emotions and the ice that he'd accumulated, Raon\u2019s mind didn\u2019t crumble.He kept enduring it with his outrageous willpower and ended up pushing him back, utilizing the kiln\u2019s heat.He still couldn\u2019t believe that such a perfect plan had failed.\u2018Where did this guy\u2026?\u2019The young bastard managed to withstand like nothing else he\u2019d seen before, despite pain that even a devil that had gone through all kinds of hardships would have been unable to endure. The absurdity of it rendered him completely speechless.Gulp.Wrath swallowed hard. He\u2019d just had a terrible image come to mind\u2014one where he was stuck on the child\u2019s forearm for the rest of his life.\u2018I\u2019ll never let that happen.\u2019He grit his teeth. He failed that day, and other times as well, but he couldn\u2019t keep losing.Raon Zieghart, don\u2019t enjoy this too much. The King of Essence hasn\u2019t even gotten started.\u201cAlright. Do your best.\u201dRaon nodded slightly and walked towards the training ground. His composed reactions were getting more and more irritating.Clean out your ears and listen. The King of Essence is a devil that doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018failure\u2019. After consuming your body, I\u2019ll kill all the humans around yo\u2026\u201cGood luck.\u201dArggggh!Raon\u2019s simple response made Wrath explode for a second time.***Runaan was staring at the door, standing at the center of the training ground.\u2018When is he coming?\u2019She knew Raon\u2019s condition had been visibly bad, and she also knew the reason.Aura.All the children who\u2019d started to cultivate after Raon managed to create an aura. However, he still hadn\u2019t managed to create an aura despite seven months passing.Raon was the only one who still hadn\u2019t acquired an aura in the fifth training ground.Even the children that had acknowledged him when he\u2019d defeated Burren began to change their minds. They wished for Martha or Burren, or even themselves to become the top trainee instead.\u2018I want to help.\u2019Raon had helped her greatly. She made greater accomplishments when training next to him, and the refreshing fragrance coming from him made her feel good during her training.\u2018Mom also said so.\u2019Her mother had told her to show her gratitude and repay him. That was why she\u2019d brought another of her favorite bead ice creams.She\u2019d given him the last one that other time, but she had three this time. She hoped he\u2019d feel better after eating it.Click.As Runaan caressed the bead ice cream box, the door to the training ground opened, and Raon\u2014who she had been waiting for\u2014finally entered.Step. Step.Running up to him, she stopped in front of Raon. His expression didn\u2019t really change, as he seemed to have gotten used to it.Rustle.She held out the small box.\u201cCheer up.\u201dRunaan nodded to Raon, who reflexively took the box.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Just as she was about to take the usual five steps away from him, she realized that Raon\u2019s refreshing scent had gotten stronger.Sniff. Sniff.It wasn\u2019t a mistake. There was a heart-shaking freshness.Runaan remained one step closer than usual, eyes shining.***\u2018What\u2019s up with her this time?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. He\u2019d walked down the mountain in a good mood, but he grew flustered as Runaan sniffed him and remained a lot closer than usual.He checked the box she gave him. It was the same type of box from the other time, with the bead ice cream in it.When he opened it, there were three bead ice creams of assorted colors underneath the white steam.Wow! Isn\u2019t that the bead ice cream?!Wrath\u2019s excited voice could be heard.\u201cAre you giving this to me?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan, still sniffing, opened her eyes and nodded.That child has been acknowledged as the King of Essence\u2019s ice cream girl from today onward. Raon, eat it all! The King of Essence wants to try different flavors. Start with the black one in the center\u2026\u2018Go away\u2026\u2019Taking the black ice cream from the box, Raon put it in his mouth. The cool and sweet taste of chocolate filled his mouth. The sweetness brought to mind the meaning of \u2018happiness found through food\u2019.It\u2019s crazy! The coolness covers the mouth, and the sweet chocolate wraps around the tongue like a ribbon. How splendid!Wrath seamlessly explained the ice cream\u2019s taste in detail, as if he\u2019d become a reviewer.More, eat more! The red one this time\u2026\u201cHeh\u2026\u201dRunaan licked her lips while drooling a little. It looked like she also wanted to eat some.\u201cThank you for the treat.\u201dRaon gave her back the box with two ice creams remaining.\u201cAre you not going to eat more?\u201dRunaan stared blankly at the returned box.\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, thank you.\u201dEnough, my ass! The King of Essence is still hungry! Eat them all!\u2018Can\u2019t you see that the child wants to eat it? Act your age.\u2019Raon squashed the rampaging Wrath with the palm of his hand.\u201cSo, did you cheer up?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah\u2026\u201dRaon snickered at Runaan, who was looking back and forth between him and the box.\u2018I knew it.\u2019She very clearly wanted to eat it, and that made it clear. Runaan had given him the ice cream to cheer him up.Despite being mostly expressionless and quiet, she was a kind girl.\u201cI\u2019ve cheered up. Thank you.\u201d\u201cMhm!\u201dRunaan smiled slightly and accepted the box. She hugged it tight, like a treasure found by an explorer.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dWithout finishing her sentence, Runaan shook her head. It was strange. She was standing closer to him than usual, and she was sniffing him a lot more.\u2018I really don\u2019t understand her.\u2019Raon shrugged, waiting for Rimmer to return after cleaning up.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cWe are going to try something special in one month.\u201dRimmer smiled, despite arriving ten minutes late.\u201cThe instructor is late once again. Ten minutes is enough time to swing a sword more than a hundred times.\u201dBurren raised his hand while frowning.\u201cAh, sorry. I needed to make some preparations.\u201dRimmer apologized with the usual hand gestures and continued. Despite saying sorry, he didn\u2019t look apologetic at all. He just kept smiling.\u201cHmm.\u201dBurren clearly didn\u2019t seem to like it, but he lowered his hand.\u201cYou\u2019ll like it too, since this will be good training.\u201dThe corners of Rimmer\u2019s lips turned up as he pointed behind him, where a circular shape was drawn on the ground.\u201cSince you\u2019ve been learning the basics and cultivating for seven months, it\u2019s time to heat things up a little. In one month, you will be sparring.\u201d\u201cOhh!\u201d\u201cFinally!\u201d\u201cSparring!\u201dThe children\u2019s shout of joy sounded like a roar. It was an opportunity to test out the aura and swordsmanship that they\u2019d been training repeatedly, so they were obviously happy.Burren\u2019s wrinkled face brightened and Martha gave an eerie smile, although Runaan\u2019s expression was still blank.\u201cSince the outcome of the spars will be included in your graduation score, there will be a ranking. You\u2019d better prepare thoroughly for the next month.\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dMartha, smiling leisurely, called out to Rimmer.\u201cHow about the morons that haven\u2019t formed an aura yet?\u201dDespite not mentioning a name, everyone looked to Raon.Raon didn\u2019t react, despite being looked at by the trainees. With a composed expression, he waited for Rimmer to open his mouth.\u201cFortunately, I heard that he also managed to form an aura.\u201d\u201cHuh? When did he\u2026?\u201d\u201cYesterday? Or maybe today?\u201d\u201cAh, is that so?\u201dMartha turned her head. Her black eyes glittered like a mud-covered black pearl.\u201cThe time has finally come. It took so long I thought I\u2019d die from boredom.\u201dShe smiled as she approached him. It was a mixture of mockery and arrogance.\u201cDo you remember what I told you before? I don\u2019t listen to those weaker than me. I think I\u2019ve waited long enough already, so let\u2019s end it now. You\u2026\u201d\u201cMartha Zieghart, step back.\u201dBurren interrupted before Raon reacted.\u201cPlanning to spar with a guy in a month, when it hasn\u2019t even been a day since he acquired an aura\u2014where\u2019s your honor as a swordsman?\u201d\u201cHah! Honor?\u201dMartha sneered. With a blatant mockery, she shook her finger.\u201cA sheltered young master from a noble family must think that honor can feed you.\u201d\u201cMartha.\u201d\u201cHonor is something displayed to someone who deserves it. The moronic guys over there managed to acquire aura in a single month, yet our top trainee took over half a year.\u201dShe pointed at the recommended children, who\u2019d learned the Rinden aura cultivation technique.\u201cEven if the cultivation technique was a higher class or better, taking seven months to create aura proves that he has no talent. You must know about it already, since you were at the Judgment Ceremony with him, right?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren frowned, and his expression grew cloudy.\u2018Certainly\u2026\u2019It\u2019d taken him two weeks to learn a top-class aura cultivation technique. Taking over half a year to get to one-star was a problem, no matter how good the cultivation technique was.\u201cI admit that he is talented in swordsmanship and fist technique, but that\u2019s it. If he has no talent in aura, then it\u2019s all pointless.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cNone of the famous warriors had a weak aura.\u201dThe trainees nodded in agreement with Martha.\u201cIsn\u2019t the instructor also asking us to spar, because you want to change the top trainee?\u201d\u201cI wonder?\u201dRimmer shrugged his shoulders and eyebrows at the same time.\u201cRaon Zieghart. You\u2019ve been a top trainee for too long, despite lacking in ability. There\u2019s no\u2026 I mean, only a few students follow you. It\u2019s about time you resigned, don\u2019t you think so?\u201dMartha snickered, glancing at Dorian and a few other trainees standing behind Raon.\u201cLike I\u2019ve said before, let\u2019s have a duel. The winner gets to be the top trainee\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dRaon shook his head before Martha even finished talking.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you think you can gamble without any money? If I\u2019m betting my title as top trainee, then you also need to bet something equivalent.\u201d\u201cDo you not understand your position? You have no allies here\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you scared?\u201dRaon smiled as he tilted his head slightly. It was a much more effective way of mocking her than what Martha had attempted with him.\u201cScared? Did you just say that to\u00a0me? Ha! Alright. I\u2019ll accept your provocation! They will be your last words.\u201dMartha snickered. With her black eyes filled with irritation, she brought forward a small wooden box.\u201cThis is an elixir that my father gave to me, the Nine Flowers Medicine. I\u2019ll give this to you if you win.\u201dThe Nine Flowers Medicine was an elixir created from combining nine different medicinal herbs, and it had an effect of enhancing the body and aura.\u2018Wrath, this is the moment I spoke about before.\u2019What are you talking about?\u2018Didn\u2019t I tell you a time would come when Martha would have something worth taking? Now is that time.\u2019He already knew that Martha had that elixir, thanks to the talkative Dorian.\u2018The Nine Flowers Medicine is acceptable.\u2019Raon slightly smiled, looking at Martha\u2014who fell for his provocation\u2014and the wooden box containing the Nine Flowers Medicine.It was a reward for a bet he was going to win anyway.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33After Rimmer declared that they would be sparring in a month, the children added fresh fuel to their training by imagining their future opponents.In order to do themselves justice, no matter who their opponent was, they kept polishing their swordsmanship and cultivating their auras.However, there were also exceptions\u2014ones that weren\u2019t any different from usual.Raon and Martha, the two whose opponents had already been decided, didn't change their attitudes at all.Raon did everything in his power to train, all while Martha remained laid back, as expected of the strongest trainee.As such, the month passed quickly, and everyone was doing their best. Finally, the sun rose on the day of the sparring matches.Since it was an opportunity to prove the might that they had been cultivating for almost a year, and to improve their score with the instructors, the trainees were filled with excitement and nervousness.Martha, on the other hand, was smiling as she looked to the side\u2014as if she didn\u2019t care about anything that was going on.\u2018I can finally get payback.\u2019She grabbed the forearm that had been struck when Raon countered her eight months before.\u2018That was the first time.\u2019She\u2019d never been hit by someone near her age before, even when she lived on the backstreets\u2014before she joined the Zieghart family. It was the first humiliation she\u2019d received in her life, so she was unable to forget about it.She\u2019d been waiting for an opportunity to repay that debt, and eight months later that day had finally arrived.\u2018It\u2019s going to end today.\u2019Unlike Raon Zieghart, who\u2019d acquired aura only a month ago, she\u2019d already had one for three years. There was no actual point in sparring.It could look cowardly, but it was a waste of time to wait for him forever when he is simply talentless.\u2018I have something I need to do.\u2019Unlike Raon, she couldn\u2019t afford to be blocked by such a thin wall. She needed to become stronger as fast as possible because she had someone to save.Whoosh!Martha closed her mouth firmly, clutching the yellow aura emanating from the palm of her hand.***Sitting on the right side of the temporary arena, Raon was sitting down checking his status window.Status WindowName: Raon Zieghart.Title: First Victory.State: Curse of Frost (Six Strands), Decline in Athletic Abilities, Decline in Mana AffinityTrait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Three-Stars), Water Resistance (Three-Stars), Perception of the Snow Flower (One-Star), Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation (Two-Stars), Coldness of the Frost (Two-Stars), Fire Resistance (Two-Stars)Strength: 35Agility: 36Stamina: 35Energy: 26Perception: 50Not only had his number of traits increased a lot, but his stats had also drastically increased thanks to overcoming his limits during training.\u2018Pretty good.\u2019Raon smiled in satisfaction at the sight of the numbers on his status window, which were clearly different from before.\u201cAttention, everyone!\u201dAs he closed the status window, he could hear Rimmer speaking. After checking every corner of the arena, Rimmer nodded.\u201cWatching others fight is just as helpful as actually participating. Try planning your movements for your own spars while watching the other trainees\u2019 fights.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cNow then. First up is Burren Zieghart and Dorian.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dBurren stood up confidently and went to the arena. Dorian, on the other hand, trembled as he crab walked forward.\u201cEx-excuse me, instructor?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI give up!\u201dDorian raised his hand energetically and announced his resignation.\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone shut their mouths as they heard his desperate voice. They looked like they were wondering what kind of guy he was.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even try, though?\u201dRimmer scratched his chin in panic.\u201cMy\u2026 My body doesn\u2019t feel good. I\u2019ve been feeling cold and aching everywhere since yesterday. Cough!\u201dDorian shuddered, lips trembling as he coughed awkwardly.\u201cReally, it\u2019s true.\u201dTaking out an ice pack from his belly pocket, he put it on his head. He really was prepared for everything.How pathetic. If the King of Essence\u2019s underling did such a thing, his head would\u2019ve been sent flying!\u2018Although, that\u2019s to be expected.\u2019Raon already knew Dorian was going to act like that. It was pretty obvious, considering his usual personality.\u201cDorian, at least try fighting. You will be able to learn something even if you lose. I\u2019ll stop it before you get hurt, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cTh-then if you can change my opponent\u2026 huff!\u201dWhen Dorian raised his head, he met Burren\u2019s eyes and started trembling again.\u201cNo matter what your status was before, you are now a Zieghart trainee. If you dishonor Zieghart, I will cut your throat right here.\u201dBurren\u2019s voice was so brutal that it was difficult to believe he was a child.\u201cHuff!\u201dDorian\u2019s jaw dropped and he hid behind Rimmer.\u201cDorian, it\u2019s just a spar. Stop thinking that it\u2019s scary. Look at it as showing what you\u2019ve done so far.\u201d\u201cAl-alright.\u201dDorian\u2019s shivering subsided a little thanks to Rimmer\u2019s reassuring voice.\u201cBurren, you should stop being so serious, too. Honor is great, but there are many other things in the world that are more important.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBurren didn\u2019t respond, but he seemed to realize he\u2019d gone too far as he softened.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes as he watched Rimmer, who was smiling between Burren and Dorian.\u2018That worked.\u2019His advice actually worked for both sides. It was proof that he\u2019d been properly watching the trainees, despite looking like he\u2019d been playing around all the time.\u2018Is that what a teacher is like?\u2019If something like this had happened in his previous life, when he was raised as an assassin, the instructor would\u2019ve cut both of their throats.Calming them down and helping them properly display their skills seemed like something a real teacher would do.\u201cThen, prepare yourselves.\u201dWith all problems solved thanks to Rimmer, Burren and Dorian faced each other.\u201cBegin!\u201dAs soon as the signal to start was given, Burren ran towards Dorian and swung his sword.Since he was using aura, his speed was incomparable to the previous duel.\u201cHiee!\u201dDorian screamed and twisted his body. Thanks to that, Burren\u2019s sword missed him by a hair.\u201cStop running away!\u201dBurren frowned and swung his sword again, keeping Dorian busy moving his feet and flailing his training sword.\u201cArgh!\u201dEven though Burren swung his sword more than five times, Dorian kept running away.\u201cHow long are you going to run?!\u201dBurren kicked the ground while knitting his brows. He closed the distance in an instant, using his real ability. He\u2019d been hiding it\u201cUah!\u201dDorian tried to quickly move his body away, but it was too late. Burren\u2019s training sword already touched his waist.Smack!With a powerful noise, Dorian\u2019s body was sent flying to the right.\u201cAwwh! Su-surrender!\u201dDorian grabbed his wrist and shouted, writhing in pain.\u2018His body is as flexible as always.\u2019Raon snickered, watching Dorian lying on the ground. His talent wasn\u2019t bad since the speed of his feet and aura control didn\u2019t lose to a member of the direct line.Although, it was obviously far from being enough to face Burren.\u201cBurren, you still can\u2019t control your emotions. If you fought him as you should\u2019ve, your sword would\u2019ve touched him in less than five strikes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re right.\u201dBurren nodded silently, stepping back.\u201cDorian, why do you keep running? You can do it, I\u2019m telling you. If you faced him instead of running away, you could\u2019ve lasted longer.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m sc-scared\u2026\u201d\u201cYou might be scared, but if you can\u2019t get over it now, you won\u2019t remain standing during a real battle. You must overcome that fear if you want to become a swordsman.\u201dUnlike Burren, Dorian was preached at for a while before returning to his place.\u201cNext, Runaan and Krein.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRunaan and the collateral Krein walked into the arena.Krein was the son of a rather influential collateral and was one of Burren\u2019s underlings that had picked a fight with Raon before. His abilities were pretty decent, but he was no match for Runaan.\u201cBegin.\u201dAs soon as Rimmer lowered his hand, Runaan and Krein ran towards each other.\u201cHaa!\u201dKrein attacked first. Gritting his teeth, he swung his training sword horizontally.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile maintaining her usual expression, Runaan swung her sword, which was exuding a white coldness, upward.Clang!With the sound of a lump of metal being crushed, Krein\u2019s sword flew away and thrust into the arena\u2019s hardened ground.Despite swinging her sword late, Runaan had successfully parried the attack.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dKrein stepped back with trembling hands.\u201cStop.\u201dRimmer walked into the arena while scratching his chin.\u201cKrein, you are too nervous. You are putting too much force on your wrist and hand. You should be more relaxed upon wielding a sword.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cAnd Runaan. It was a nice use of the principle of attacking first despite starting late, but your aura didn\u2019t reach the tip of your sword.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dRunaan nodded innocently.\u201cGood job.

Come forth.\u201d\u201cI thought I was going to die of old age while waiting.\u201dMartha\u2019s black eyes glittered in excitement. On the other hand, Raon stayed placid as he stood in front of her.\u201cEight months was such a long time to wait. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\u201cShall we make another bet?\u201dRaon raised a finger towards Martha, who was displaying her aggression.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe loser will obey the winner, who will become the top trainee. How about it?\u201d\u201cObedience? I don\u2019t need the obedience of a dull guy like you, but whatever.\u201dMartha narrowed her eyes and nodded. She didn\u2019t even consider the thought that she might lose.\u201cThis is the last spar for today. Everyone, watch well. Now then\u2026\u201dWith an obscure smile, Rimmer raised his hand.\u201cBegin!\u201dAs soon as Rimmer lowered his hand, Martha kicked off from the ground. With a thud, her face was already right in front of Raon\u2019s.Whoosh!He swung his sword at Martha\u2019s training sword, slamming down.Clang!The impact of two swords clashing scattered sparks in the air.\u201cAre you wondering why I didn\u2019t use my aura?\u201dMartha smiled, pushing her sword towards him.\u201cLet\u2019s try fighting with swordsmanship first. After that, I\u2019ll make you understand just how powerful an aura is!\u201dThe moment her voice reached past his ears, her swordsmanship changed rapidly. It wasn\u2019t just the speed and strength, but its path also grew mysterious.Clang!Raon narrowed his eyes while parrying her training sword.\u2018It\u2019s a swordsmanship I\u2019m not aware of.\u2019It was fast, powerful, and mysterious. It seemed to be an advanced swordsmanship she\u2019d learned during the direct line training.\u2018It\u2019s powerful. However\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t perfect. It would\u2019ve been better if she used the \u2018Combination\u2019 Sword that everyone had learned.Clang! Claaang!Raon blocked Martha\u2019s strikes by using the five postures of the \u2018Combination Sword\u2019.\u201cDid you block all of that?\u201dMartha\u2019s expression grew dejected. She couldn\u2019t pierce his defense despite striking dozens of times while using an unknown swordsmanship.\u201cEvery swordsmanship starts from five forms. If you understand that, it\u2019s not difficult to block.\u201dParrying Martha\u2019s swing, Raon approached her and thrust his fist.Whoosh!She stepped to the right and avoided it. Aiming for an opening, she swung her sword at his waist.Clank!Raon parried the attack by holding the sword vertically, then pushed towards Martha.\u201cI knew it.\u201dMartha stepped back while spinning her sword.\u201cYou are talented, I\u2019ll give you that. But that\u2019s only your swordsmanship. It\u2019s already been decided what a defective warrior with a weak aura will become!\u201dA yellow aura surrounded her. The training ground shook slightly at the aura of earth attribute.Thud!Martha stomped her feet. As the ground caved in, her training sword pierced through the air.\u201cHuff!\u201dHe held his sword towards the yellow aura pouring down on him.Slam!Blocking the sword made his legs tremble. Despite it being the same dash as before, the speed and power were both on a different scale.\u201cOh, did you block it?\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes, seen through the gap between the swords, narrowed.\u201cDo you understand now? Just how strong a sword used with proper aura is.\u201dRaon\u2019s wrist and thigh were trembling. Martha raised her chin and watched him.\u201cAura is more dependent on talent than swordsmanship. With your talent, which managed to create an aura as small as a bean after seven months, you can\u2019t become a swordsman.\u201dMartha\u2019s strikes gradually grew faster and stronger. His whole body faltered each time he blocked the blows.\u201cThe aura I\u2019m using right now isn\u2019t my full power. I\u2019ll give you one last chance, surrender now. If not, I\u2019ll crush your bones.\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201dRaon slammed his sword to the right. With a bang, Martha was pushed back.\u201cYou are so stupid for refusing my last consideration.\u201dMartha\u2019s voice grew as cold as the northern wind.\u201cSaying talent, talent every time. People in this household really love talent so much. It\u2019s annoying.\u201dRaon snickered.\u2018Talent is important, of course.\u2019However, the temperament of a warrior was more important than talent. No matter how powerful a martial art one has learned, or how talented they are, it is useless if the person in question is weak.\u201cYou might think I\u2019m noisy because you are talentless, but I am happy whenever I hear about talent.\u201dThe corners of Martha\u2019s mouth raised.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to make sure to show you what real talent is!\u201dThe brown energy emanating around her grew thicker. It resembled a sharply ground boulder falling.\u201cThen I\u2019ll show you the opposite.\u201dThat there\u2019s something more important than talent.The twilight reflected in his eyes and one red flower of flame blossomed from his sharp blade.The First Flame of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019.The flame was the first, and also the one.Zieghart\u2019s legend was burning at the end of Raon\u2019s sword, the first in over a thousand years.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMartha Zieghart was a very proud person.The reason she failed during her previous term wasn\u2019t because she lacked ability, but because she almost killed the two direct line bastards that had hurt her pride.Since it became annoying after that for various reasons, she had intended to take it easy in the fifth training ground. However, there was one guy that still irritated her.Raon Zieghart.That precocious kid kept being an eyesore.She wanted to fight him already. However, she agreed with Rimmer that fighting him when he didn\u2019t even have an aura was dirty, so she held back.That was why she was happier than anyone else when she heard Raon had acquired an aura, because she could finally get payback for her previous humiliation.The spar began and she crossed swords with Raon.His talent in swordsmanship shone even more in an actual fight, to a point that he could perfectly defend himself against a swordsmanship that he\u2019d never seen before.However, as soon as she started using Titan\u2019s aura, Raon got pushed back as easily as a paper doll.It was to be expected.The difference in size and purity of aura was as great as the distance between the sky and earth.The whole situation was in Martha\u2019s favor, to the point that she could break Raon\u2019s bones whenever she wanted.Despite knowing that, Raon\u2019s fighting spirit didn\u2019t fade.His eyes seemed to be taunting her, seeming to say, \u2018Come at me as much as you want!\u2019It was ridiculous.He looked like an idiotic rabbit that didn\u2019t even know who was holding it by its neck.Pathetic bastard.Martha smirked and swung her sword down, putting in more aura and strength.Thud!The arena trembled.Raon withstood it.He didn\u2019t fall, despite her repeated strikes.It was annoying.The way he was trying to climb up high. despite having the worst talent, made her boil with anger.\u2018Don\u2019t resent me for this.\u2019His limbs might\u2019ve broken, but he left her with no choice. Pulling out an even more powerful aura, she aimed her sword in front of herself.It was the posture for Hard Stone.She was going to pierce Raon\u2019s defense using the energy of a sharp rock.It was when she was about to kick the ground.A red flame ignited at the end of Raon\u2019s blade.A very small flame.And yet, it was redder and more beautiful than any other flame. When Martha saw it, a chill went down in her spine.\u2018What is that?\u2019It was creepy. She was engulfed by a strange anxiety.\u2018No, I\u2019m not afraid!\u2019Martha grit her teeth. She couldn\u2019t believe she was afraid of Raon, even for a moment. No, she didn\u2019t want to believe it.Whoosh!She struck with the training sword, using the Titan\u2019s aura in its dull blade.Rage!At that moment, Raon took a step. The small flame burning at his training sword created a single line.A red line drawn from left to right.The Titan\u2019s aura melted upon touching that line.And.Crack!The extremely solid training sword was broken in half, flying through the air.Tap!The sound of a broken blade thrusting into the arena floor invaded her ears.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMartha stared at the severed sword, dazed.\u201cHow\u2026 How did this hap\u2026\u201dHer lips and hands trembled in disbelief at the same time.\u201cIs that the talent you spoke about?\u201dRaon Zieghart stared at her coldly. The flame ignited at the end of his sword was already gone.\u201cA talent that can\u2019t even withstand a single immature strike. It should be considered pointless.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201dUnlike her usual self, Martha Zieghart couldn\u2019t respond at all. She lowered her head, just like her broken sword.***\u201cWh-what?! What happened just now?!\u201d\u201cTh-the training sword, which was coated with Titan\u2019s aura, was severed in a single strike.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201dRaon could feel the trainees\u2019 gazes from everywhere. Panic, distrust, and astonishment. It looked like they\u2019d even forgotten to breathe.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dAnd Rimmer, who was standing in front of them, was no exception. His eyes were wide, and his long ears looked even more pointy.Apparently, severing Martha\u2019s sword in a single strike surprised him.\u2018Well, I\u2019m also surprised.\u2019The power of the first stage of \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, the First Flame, had exceeded his expectations to the point that he would\u2019ve cut Martha if he hadn\u2019t controlled its power properly.\u2018If it\u2019s already this powerful at two-stars\u2026\u2019His heart pounded in anticipation for three-stars and above.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHe lowered his gaze upon hearing the groaning sound from below. Martha\u2019s black eyes were burning red.\u2018She doesn't look like she will admit defeat.\u2019That wasn\u2019t an expression of surrender. Since she couldn\u2019t even properly see\u00a0how\u00a0her sword was severed, she wasn\u2019t going to admit her defeat.\u201cI can\u2019t accept this.\u201dThe words he\u2019d expected came right from Martha\u2019s mouth. She threw away the broken blade and clenched her fist.Whir!Titan\u2019s aura surrounded her body, creating an energy as solid as an unbreakable rock.\u201cI knew it.\u201dRaon nodded and put down his training sword.\u201cI will make you admit defeat.\u201d\u201cI will never!\u201dMartha kicked off from the ground. She dashed at him from the left, from the front this time. Her movements were stiff, yet fast and heavy.\u201cHaah!\u201dAlong with a shout of concentration, she thrust her fist.Pow!Raon chopped down her fist with his elbow. The immense shock twisted Martha\u2019s body.But she didn\u2019t stop. She grit her teeth and kept punching.Wham!Raon drew a circle with his palm. Smoothly blocking her fist, he kicked at her abdomen.\u201cKuh!\u201dIt was a direct hit, yet Martha only groaned without stepping back. Her strong willpower suited the sturdy aura.\u201cIt\u2026 it\u2019s not over yet!\u201dMartha bit her lip and thrust her fist. Despite her panic, her fist still went along the proper trajectory. The martial arts of a prestigious family seemed to shine, even at a time like that.\u2018But that\u2019s not enough.\u2019It was a quick and precise strike of a fist, imbued with a powerful aura, yet nothing more. She lacked training, by far.Wham!Dodging the fist aimed at his forehead, he struck her back with the edge of his hand.\u201cKuh!\u201dThe impact reaching her through the Titan\u2019s aura made her drool. After flinching, she counterattacked even faster. The savagery didn\u2019t match her elegant figure.\u2018She is pretty tough, at least.\u2019She was counterattacking despite being hit repeatedly by a fist that would make an adult swordsman fall. Her willpower and body\u2019s durability weren\u2019t at the level of a trainee.\u201cHaah!\u201dMartha stomped on the ground. The sand on the floor rose up and obscured his vision. Before he could sense her presence, her fist was swung at his right side.Pow!The strike felt like a rock thrown by a trebuchet. His whole body trembled each time he blocked it with his elbow.\u201cAaah!\u201dShe wasn\u2019t going to miss the opportunity that she\u2019d created with so much difficulty. Holding her breath, she kept striking relentlessly with her fist.Wham!After twenty swift strikes, when Martha stopped for a moment to catch her breath, Raon\u2019s fist struck her abdomen.\u201cKuh!\u201dMartha grabbed her belly and stepped back. Her eyes were filled with distrust.\u201cDespite what you said, your fists aren\u2019t really impressive.\u201dRaon shook his hand and elbow, which he\u2019d used to block Martha\u2019s fists.\u201cH-how\u2026?\u201d\u201cSkill.\u201dLaughing at Martha, who was in panic, he turned his wrist.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018The defense of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 is also excellent.\u2019Probably because his image was a flame that wouldn\u2019t be extinguished, the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was also effective in defense.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dMartha raised her head while biting her lip. Titan\u2019s aura was gathering up in her clenched fist.Whir!The special technique \u2018Single Point\u2019 consisted of concentrated aura in a single spot. Her talent was indeed excellent for her to be using that at her age.The rage was gone from her expression. Her eyes, once filled with anger, were emitting a clear light once again.\u201cI\u2019ll admit you\u2019re strong.\u201dThe energy gathered in her fist formed into a proper shape. It was the proof that she\u2019d attained the rank of Sword User.\u201cI will admit my defeat if you can overcome this!\u201dMartha dashed forward like a bear hunting its prey. It was as heavy as a rock rolling down the mountain.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon sighed lightly. He took a step and thrust his fist, using the energy from the step.The rotation, starting from the ankle, went up through the femoral muscles and reached his back. At that moment, his fist was imbued with explosive power.Slam!The fist containing the flame of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 shattered the lump of brown aura and twisted Martha\u2019s arm.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs the Titan\u2019s aura was shattered into pieces, he was able to see Martha\u2019s bloodshot eyes.Whir!Swept away by the tornado created by the blow, she bounced back and faltered like a reed in a storm.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dAfter shaking her head, Martha fell backward with her eyes closed. Despite having fainted, her fist remained clenched.\u2018That\u2019s some amazing willpower, at least.\u2019It was difficult to believe that sort of willpower belonged to a child that was almost fifteen years old. That was more surprising than her ability or talent.\u201cHuff!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d\u201cNo way. How did Martha\u2026?\u201dThe trainees that followed Martha, as well as those who were against her, were unable to raise their dropped jaws.\u201cRaon Zieghart\u2026\u201dBurren glared at Raon as his clenched fist trembled.\u201c\u2026\u201dRunaan looked as blank as always, but she was exhaling cold steam from her gaping mouth, which seemed to mean that she was excited.\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dRimmer, who had been stunned for a moment, ran up to Martha to check on her.\u201cTsk. I should be scolding her, but she fainted.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue after checking her condition.\u201cThat\u2019s it for today. When you return, think about what you were lacking today.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cThen, except Raon, everyone leave.\u201d\u201cWhy me\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause I have something to give you, and also have some preaching left to do.\u201dWith a grin, Rimmer ran to the infirmary over the wall.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dAs Raon blankly stared at the wall Rimmer had jumped over, Burren approached him.\u201cI knew you would catch up.\u201dBurren was smiling, but it was difficult to tell if it was from admiration or anticipation.\u201cI\u2019m different from Martha. I won\u2019t give up, even if you run ahead like a rabbit. I won\u2019t be careless, even if you fall behind like a turtle. I will defeat you at the graduation exam, putting everything I have at stake.\u201dAfter saying that, he left the training ground. He looked refreshed.\u2018He\u2019s definitely changed.\u2019The egoistic and envy-driven Burren didn\u2019t exist anymore. He seemed to have come to a realization, as he\u2019d gotten rid of his conceit and replaced it with confidence.Tap tap.Somebody tapped his shoulder from behind. When he looked back, Runaan was standing there with glittering purple eyes.Nod.She visibly nodded. That seemed to mean that he\u2019d done well. Holding the bead ice cream box tightly, she trotted out of the training ground.\u201cJust what?\u201dRaon opened his mouth wide. He still couldn\u2019t understand what she was trying to do. Shaking his head, he walked next to the platform that the chairs were at.As he was waiting for Rimmer and sitting on a chair, he noticed a book on the platform.It was the book Rimmer used as his pillow when he napped. He tried opening it.\u201cHuh?\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes widened after seeing its contents.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019He\u2019d thought it was just his pillow, but it wasn\u2019t. The trainees\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, and the way to improve them, were written in it in detail.He read the information on Burren on the first page.\u2018Has exceptional talent but is very conceited. Changed a lot after becoming a trainee. Realized what he lacked was willpower and is spending lots of time meditating. Uses an elegant and systematic swordsmanship, and he also thinks it\u2019s important\u2026\u2019They were difficult things to notice if he wasn\u2019t watching the trainees closely. And yet, the book wasn\u2019t just on Burren, but for every single one of the trainees.\u2018How about me\u2026?\u2019Raon read the information written about him.\u2018Extremely talented in swordsmanship and fist technique, and has a great mana perception, but is struggling with learning the aura cultivation technique. Needs to be taught about attributes. Need to find a way to make him feel the fire\u2026\u2019The information was too detailed, to the point that it felt like he overdid it.\u2018Instructor Rimmer\u2026\u2019He\u2019d thought Rimmer was always playing around like a slacker, but he\u2019d actually been observing everything in great detail.Raon smiled, an unknown emotion warming his heart. It was the first time he\u2019d ever felt that way, but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant.That\u2019s unexpected.\u2018You know, right?\u2019But I still don\u2019t like him. He is still arrogant and irritating.Wrath had grown even more pessimistic towards the world after he failed to take over Raon\u2019s body.Back in devildom, there was a time where pointy ears and dwarves came over. The King of Essence froze every single one of those naughty guys\u2026\u2018You really talk too much.\u2019Raon tapped the flowery bracelet and Wrath shut his mouth. It was difficult to handle how much he talked.Kuh! The King of Essence is the definition of reticence. You are saying that I talk too much, despite being the least talkative one among the monarchs of the devildom. Just what kind of bullshit is that? Talking too much means\u2026\u2018Wow.\u2019As he tapped his bracelet once again to shut him up,\u00a0Rimmer returned over the wall.He couldn\u2019t tell why he always entered over the wall, despite the door existing.\u201cRaon.\u201dRimmer approached him while smiling. His expression was still filled with surprise.\u201cIt was an excellent aura control, despite it not having been a long time since you acquired it. However, it was unnecessary to take hits on purpose or throw away your sword.\u201dRimmer tapped his shoulder while smiling.\u201cThat\u2019s what an instructor would say. Personally, I am thoroughly satisfied with that match. Congratulations on becoming the undisputed top trainee. This is yours now.\u201dHe handed over the wooden box he had placed in his inner chest pocket. It was the elixir that Martha had entrusted him with.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon bowed his head to Rimmer as he accepted the elixir.\u201cIt was a bet between you two, you don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m still thanking you.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a thanks for the elixir. It was for looking over his training and giving him various pieces of advice.Despite being late and slacking, he did instruct him properly when he needed it the most.In fact, he probably wouldn\u2019t have acquired the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 yet if it weren\u2019t for his teachings.Since he didn\u2019t have a teacher in his previous life, only animal trainers, he thought Rimmer was worthy of his gratitude.\u201cAnyway.\u201dRimmer snickered, watching him with a satisfied expression.\u201cI\u2019ll get going, then.\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dHe flickered his index and middle finger together.\u201cI told you there\u2019s somewhere we need to go together.\u2019\u201cSomewhere to go?\u201d\u201cThe audience chamber in the lord\u2019s manor.\u201dRimmer grinned and pointed to the west.\u201cThe head of house has summoned you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To summon him right after the spar\u2026 He couldn\u2019t understand his intentions.\u201cAh. To be more precise, he told me to bring the top trainee.\u201dRimmer shrugged his shoulders.\u2018The top trainee, huh?\u2019It meant that it didn\u2019t matter who it was, as long as it was the top trainee. It seemed like Glenn thought Martha would win the duel.\u2018That\u2019s funny.\u2019It was funny because it seemed that he had defeated Glenn's predicted top trainees one after another, both Burren and Martha.\u201cWhy did he summon me?\u201d\u201cHow should I know?\u201dRimmer pouted, shaking his head. From his expression, he definitely looked like he knew the reason. He just didn\u2019t have any intention of telling him.\u201cWhen do I need to go?\u201dRaon asked as he caressed the box in his pocket.\u201cRight now.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dHe nodded and dusted off his clothes.\u201cAre you going to go like that? Aren\u2019t you going to change?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of the head of house?\u201d\u201cWhy would I need to be afraid? He isn\u2019t calling me to eat me up.\u201dGlenn\u2019s cold gaze was awkward, but he didn\u2019t need to be afraid.\u201cI knew you were funny.\u201dRimmer nodded and giggled. He tapped Raon\u2019s shoulder with a satisfied expression.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRaon headed towards the audience chamber of the lord\u2019s manor, following Rimmer.\u201cDid Lady Martha really lose?\u201d\u201cTo such a small child\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the age, their talent was different.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s luck. There\u2019s no other way!\u201dThose he met on the way were sneakily glancing at him with either amazed or surprised expressions.\u201cIt looks like everyone already knows that you\u2019ve beaten Martha.\u201dRimmer grinned at him.\u201cAlready?\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s because Zieghart is an insulated family.\u201dHe murmured that, because it\u2019s closed to the outside, the rumors spread even more quickly inside.\u201cMartha was excellent enough to defeat other members of the direct line. It\u2019s natural for rumors to spread once you won against such a child head on.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you should be careful. Falling is as fast as rising.\u201dRimmer pointed at himself while saying that. He seemed to be referencing the way he fell after his energy center was broken.\u201cAnyway, congratulations. This is a good occasion, so enjoy it.\u201dHe entered the lord\u2019s manor while whistling. The warriors seemed to be aware of their visit, since they didn\u2019t block their way.\u201cThe Lord is waiting.\u201dWhen they reached the audience chamber through the long hallway on the first floor, Roenn\u2014Glenn\u2019s butler\u2014opened the door with a smile.Clunk.The huge metal door split apart with a heart-stopping sound. The energy was magnificent enough to pierce the sky, spreading out from the door.Raon grabbed the left side of his chest.\u2018Has it always been this heavy\u2026?\u2019After acquiring an aura, Glenn\u2019s pressure felt even larger. He couldn\u2019t stop his hand from trembling in the wake of the endlessly powerful wave of energy.A mere human\u2026Wrath\u2019s voice was also trembling, squashed by Glenn\u2019s pressure.\u201cYou can feel it properly now that you have an aura, right?\u201dRimmer smiled, a single drop of sweat trickling down his forehead.\u201cThat is our king.\u201dLifting the corners of his mouth, he entered.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon swallowed and followed him. Glenn\u2019s pressure became more powerful the more he approached him. It felt like his shoulder was being squashed by the mighty wave of energy.\u201cGreetings to the lord!\u201dRaon, who was standing next to Rimmer, knelt. Glenn\u2019s wave of energy finally subsided.He could control his pressure in a moment. Even Derus didn\u2019t seem like he would be a match for the might that reached for the sky.\u201cStand up.\u201dRaon\u2019s was automatically lifted by the voice that gave him the order. Upon meeting Glenn\u2019s red eyes, everything around him grew blurry. It really was an overwhelming presence.\u201cI brought the top trainee, as my lord commanded.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWithout even responding to Rimmer, Glenn stared at Raon. Maybe he didn\u2019t like it or feel comfortable about it. Raon couldn\u2019t read his thoughts at all.\u201cDid you acquire the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow long did it take?\u201d\u201cIt took about seven months.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s slow.\u201dHe tilted his chin slightly. It looked like he was looking down on him.\u201cShow me the aura.\u201dUpon hearing Glenn\u2019s order, Raon looked at Rimmer. When he asked with his eyes whether it was okay to use his aura in front of the head of house, Rimmer nodded.\u201cNormally you can\u2019t, but he is asking you to.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRaon stood, clenching his fist before relaxing it.Rage!With the sound of an almost extinguished small flame being ignited once again, the red flame appeared. The First Flame of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019. The one and the first flame was ignited.\u201cIs that the first one of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019?\u201dGlenn\u2019s pupils, which looked like they were sunk deep under the mud, trembled lightly.\u201cWhat did you pursue upon igniting that aura?\u201d\u201cIt is a flame that won\u2019t be extinguished, nor be vanquished.\u201d\u201cNot extinguished?\u201d\u201cI imagined a flame that won\u2019t be extinguished by wind, nor by rain.\u201dGlenn kept staring at the flame burning on Raon\u2019s hand for a long time without saying anything. Raon thought he might have looked like he was touched, although that could\u2019ve been just his impression.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHe received a compliment, one that he\u2019d never expected to get. He tried touching his ears, thinking he might have misheard it.\u201cA swordsman or magician of fire attribute has the best power output, but their endurance and defense are weaker in return. An inextinguishable flame might allow you to overcome that weakness. Consider how to use it thoroughly.\u2019\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201dRaon nodded with surprised eyes. He\u2019d never even dreamed that Glenn would give him such advice, so his voice trembled slightly.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t seem so strange. I\u2019m merely telling you what I couldn\u2019t tell you during the Judgment Ceremony.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHe understood. Glenn had given advice to everyone but Raon during the Judgment Ceremony. It seemed that he was giving him the advice that he couldn\u2019t give him back then.\u2018That\u2019s one mysterious personality.\u2019Glenn was as cold as a man sculpted from a glacier, but he did take care of people sometimes.He was the complete opposite of Derus, who pretended to take care of his people but actually used them as objects.\u201cI\u2019ll now tell you the reason that I called for you.\u201dResting his chin on his hand, Glenn gazed down at Raon.\u201cI\u2019ll be giving you all a mission around next year.\u201d\u201cA mission?\u201d\u201cYou all have been training for well over a year, including the temporary training period. Since you\u2019ve all acquired the aura needed to become Beginner Swordsmen, it is alright to go outside.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think you are too young? Age doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to battles. Swordsmen must always fight for as long as they can hold a sword, regardless of their age.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s not it. I thought it was too late.\u2019In his previous life, he had received assassination missions at the age of eight, not fourteen. His current age wasn\u2019t too young, but too old.\u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Tell all the trainees to prepare thoroughly, so that they can play their role regardless of the situation and time.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201d\u201cYou should head out now.\u201dGlenn closed his eyes and waved his hand. Raon knelt once again and bowed to him, then left the audience chamber.\u201cIt was about time you got a mission.\u201dRimmer grinned and grabbed the back of his hand, fingers knitted together.\u201cWhat kind of mission is going to be assigned to us?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been decided yet. Monster subjugation, protecting a leading figure, bandit extermination\u2026 Since you don\u2019t know what kind of mission you will get, you\u2019d better prepare to be able to handle all kinds of situations, just as the head of house said.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the instructor coming with us?\u201d\u201cI will, but my mission is different from yours, as the instructor\u2019s mission is to protect you.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dRimmer\u2019s eyes widened. It looked like he expected him to be surprised.\u2018Of course I\u2019ll have to carry out the mission by myself.\u2019He\u2019d received nothing like \u2018help\u2019 in his previous life, even when he got a mission at the age of eight. An instructor that would protect him in case of emergency was a huge luxury.\u2018Zieghart is softer than I thought.\u2019Leaving a surprised Rimmer behind, he left the lord\u2019s manor with a smile.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After Raon left to the annex building, Rimmer returned to the audience chamber.\u201cMy lord looks very happy.\u201dRimmer smiled and looked\u00a0 at Glenn, who was standing on the platform.\u201cI\u2019m the same as always.\u201d\u201cHeh. But the corners of your lips are two millimeters higher than usual.\u201d\u201cStop your pleasantries and give me a report on Martha\u2019s condition.\u201d\u201cShe is bruised quite badly, but she will heal with some rest. The problem is the mental shock she received.\u201d\u201cIf she can\u2019t overcome such a thing, she has no reason to carry the name Zieghart.\u201dGlenn applied the Zieghart\u2019s mindset without exception for Martha, who had been adopted at eight years old.\u201cDid you help Raon draw an image for his fire?\u201d\u201cI\u00a0am\u00a0a teacher, after all. But Raon was the one who chose it. I only taught him that there are multiple possibilities.\u201dRimmer shrugged his shoulders and continued.\u201cWhat is your impression after seeing the long-awaited first head of house\u2019s aura?\u201d\u201cIt was exactly the same as it was written. It was as beautiful as a flower made of fire, and it also wielded an incomparable power compared to its size.\u201d\u201cYes. It completely destroyed Martha\u2019s Titan aura, which she\u2019s been cultivating for over four years. It was such an unreasonable power. By the way, isn\u2019t the color supposed to be golden?\u201d\u201cThe color will change slightly depending on the fire\u2019s power. Keep instructing him on the correct path in the future as well.\u201d\u201cI knew the head of house had a soft spot for him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn didn\u2019t answer, waving his hand with his eyes closed. He was telling him to get out, since he was being annoying.\u201cThen, please take care of choosing a mission for the children.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not my job. It\u2019s the General Administration\u2019s. Stop worrying about that. Just keep raising the children to survive in any kind of mission.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll make sure to instruct them so they won\u2019t become lazy.\u201d\u201cI can only say that you should look at yourself, first.\u201dGlenn snickered upon seeing Rimmer\u2019s confident expression.\u201cWe call that a two-faced teacher.\u201dRimmer grinned in return.***\u201cHmm?\u201dJudiel, who was taking care of the garden, turned around upon hearing a stepping sound from behind her.\u201cHuff. Yo-young master Raon!\u201dRaon was gazing at her. The moment she met his gaze, she felt her heart sink.\u201cYou have returned!\u201dShe stood up and checked on his condition. His clothes were dusty, but he didn\u2019t seem to be hurt anywhere.\u2018No way. Did he win against her? Against Martha?\u2019She\u2019d already known that Raon would spar with Martha Zieghart after word had spread a month before.However, she\u2019d never thought that he would win, let alone return completely uninjured.\u201cDid you win the spar?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dRaon smiled.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dLooking at his victorious smile reminded her of that day. The red eyes floating on the lake\u2026 Calling it an incarnation of fear wasn\u2019t an exaggeration.\u2018Of course. There\u2019s no way this monster would lose to a mere genius.\u2019She realized, once again, just what kind of existence Raon Zieghart was.\u201cThe Central Martial Palace will contact you again soon to order you to investigate me more thoroughly.\u201d\u201cTh-they would.\u201d\u201cWrite whatever you think you should write and bring it to me.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dWith a smile that gave her goosebumps, he entered the annex building. Judiel dropped the weeds from her hands, her back drenched in a cold sweat.\u201cA monster that defeated a genius\u2026\u201d***\u201cRaon!\u201dAs soon as Raon entered the annex building, he met Sylvia as she was putting on her clothes.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cWhere would I go?! You were supposed to return today, but you hadn\u2019t arrived. I was about to head out to look for you!\u201dSylvia ran towards him. She looked faster than an average swordsman.\u201cAre you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?\u201dHer eyes kept moving left and right, like falling leaves.\u201cI\u2019m not hurt.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dSylvia sighed in relief, smoothing a hand down her chest. However, her eyes didn\u2019t stop peering at Raon\u2019s body.\u201cWas the spar canceled?\u201d\u201cNo, I won.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re still not hurt?\u201d\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t get hit.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You won without getting hit once?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cRe-really?\u201dHelen dropped Sylvia\u2019s outer garments.Since it was common knowledge that Martha\u2019s talent was on par with the direct line, their surprised reactions were understandable.\u201cW-well if you aren\u2019t hurt, let\u2019s eat first! Helen, prepare the meal immediately!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cHuh? But you haven't eaten dinner yet.\u201d\u201cI have something to do today.\u201dRaon shook his head while touching the wooden box in his pocket, which contained an elixir.It was time for him to become stronger once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019d told them to not enter, but he was preparing\u2014just in case.\u201cWrath.\u201dHe tapped the ice flower bracelet on his wrist to call out Wrath.How dare a mere insect human call the King of Essence by name.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have told me your name then.\u201dIt\u2019s because the King of Essence didn\u2019t know you would resist the possession!Wrath murmured that he informs the humans of his great name as a last consideration before eating up their mind and body.\u201cI don\u2019t know about great, but are you planning to interfere again?\u201dAs a monarch of devildom, the King of Essence keeps his words. The King of Essence will never interrupt you again while you are cultivating.\u201cI suppose, since you must\u2019ve used all the power that you\u2019ve stored up so far.\u201dRaon nodded. Wrath had attacked him with everything he had when he was acquiring the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 a month ago. He shouldn\u2019t have been able to recover his strength yet.You idiot! The energy of Wrath can be used at any time. It\u2019s just to keep the word of a monarch\u2026\u201cAh, whatever.\u201dSeriously, you little shit!When Raon interrupted him, Wrath started to emit coldness while trembling in anger.\u201cToo bad. It was a chance to raise my stats again.\u201dKuh\u2026Wrath ground his teeth. The frost started falling between his icy flames, as though he was about to explode in anger.Raon scowled, watching the trembling Wrath.\u2018I can\u2019t be careless against him.\u2019Wrath was an enemy, not an ally. He couldn\u2019t be careless in front of him, whether he was cultivating or training. He had to keep on his toes at all times.\u201cWell, then.\u201dHe took out the wooden box containing the Nine Flowers Medicine and opened the lid. It radiated with the strong fragrance of dry bushes found in the fall mountains.It smelled nice.From the way the medicine spread its fragrance throughout the room, he could already tell that it was a very effective one.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon exhaled slowly and put the Nine Flowers Medicine in his mouth. The bitter, yet strong, taste of the medicine covered his whole mouth.\u2018He told me to chew it down.\u2019Following Rimmer\u2019s advice, he swallowed it after chewing it, and it was released in his throat.Whir.The thick energy within the Nine Flowers Medicine spread out throughout his mana circuits like smoke rising from a chimney.Raon sat down and closed his eyes, starting to rotate his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and cultivating the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.The energy from the Nine Flowers Medicine circulated throughout his body and expanded his muscles. The energy center was stimulated then expanded, and his mana perception increased to the extreme.Whap!The hot energy, similar to the one heated in the charcoal kiln, dashed through his mana circuits.Whap!The pure ice melting in his mana circuits followed the path cleared by the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 to circulate throughout his entire body.\u2018Cultivating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 first was the correct choice.\u2019The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 cleared up the coldness and impurities inside his mana circuits, and the energy of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 dashed along that path like a ray of light, which allowed the elixir to be used more efficiently.The two cultivation techniques synergized as one, maximizing their merits, and canceling out their demerits.Whir!All the mana from Nine Flowers Medicine was melted down, and the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, his body, and his energy center were connected by a red path.Raon got even more absorbed into the world of cultivation, feeling the endless flow of mana.***When the sun that rose was setting down on the western mountain once again, and the evening glow was shining upon him, Raon finally opened his eyes.[The fourth 'Ring of Fire' has been created.]['Ring of Fire'\u00a0has reached four-stars.]['Ring of Fire (Four-Stars)' has increased the expertise of the body and soul.][Strength, agility, and stamina have increased with the effect of the 'Ring of Fire (Four-Stars)'.][Energy, willpower, and perception increase with the effect of the 'Ring of Fire (Four-Stars)'.]Raon clenched his fist. He could feel the fourth ring rotating violently, even without the messages.[Constitution 'Decline in Athletic Abilities' has disappeared.][Constitution 'Decline in Mana Affinity' has disappeared.]['Water Resistance' has reached four-stars.]['Perception of the Snow Flower' has reached two-stars.]The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 wasn\u2019t the only skill that was raised to four-stars. and also increased in rank.\u2018Amazing.\u2019It was a tremendous change, especially considering he\u2019d only taken an intermediate elixir.But of course, it wasn\u2019t only because of the elixir.The efforts he\u2019d been making for almost a year had been accumulating and were finally exploding because of the elixir.Raon rolled his shoulders and stood up. His energy center was full of hot and cold energy, and his body was as light as a leaf riding the wind.His body\u2019s condition was perfect, as if he just woke up from a good sleep. He felt like he could now single handedly win against Martha with her aura, using his physical abilities alone.Whap!When he was about to open the status window, Wrath, who was inside the bracelet, burst up with a blue flame.Four stars?\u2018Hmm?\u2019Four stars in Water Resistaaanceee?* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Wrath\u2019s voice was trembling furiously. It appeared that he hadn\u2019t managed to see the information about the 'Ring of Fire', only managing to see the \u2018Water Resistance' that appeared at the end.\u2018Now that I think about it, he doesn\u2019t know.\u2019Wrath could see the message but couldn\u2019t see the status window. It looked like he was surprised because he realized Raon had \u2018Water Resistance\u2019.You sly bastard! Have you been deceiving the King of Essence with your four-star Water Resistance?!\u201cYou never asked me, though.\u201dUgh!Wrath gave him a deadly glare.I expected you to have a resistance, but it\u2019s a four-stars type that can grow! You disgusting bastard!\u201cHow come I\u2019m disgusting just because I have \u2018Water Resistance\u2019\u2026\u201dRaon smiled bitterly.\u2018Seeing the ruckus he\u2019s causing over the \u2018Water Resistance alone\u2019, he\u2019ll likely start rampaging once he learns about the 'Ring of Fire'.\u2019Raon thought he might be able to see Wrath faint once he learned about the 'Ring of Fire', which increased the expertise of his body and soul, or about his reincarnation.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you that you can\u2019t win against me.\u201dShut your mouth. If the King of Essence uses his original power, a mere human like you will easily be turned into a block of ice.\u2018But you can\u2019t.\u2019You never fail to anger me whenever you open your mouth!Unable to withstand it anymore, Wrath dashed at him with an exploding flame of coldness.Whap!The coldness that could turn his lips blue in an instant stormed around his entire body.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe coldness and emotional stimulation had become stronger. It looked like Wrath had also grown.\u2018However.\u2019The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 had leveled up even more than that. In front of the four naturally spinning rings, Wrath\u2019s anger was child\u2019s play to deal with.Bang!As he was enduring the blue coldness stabbing at him throughout his body, the messages appeared.[You have withstood Wrath\u2019s attack.][Stamina has increased.]Damn it!Wrath let out a horrible shriek, similar to a monster\u2019s, and came out from Raon\u2019s body.It feels like all my limbs are gone! There is no way! No way!He started screaming. It looked like he gave up on pretending to be composed.\u201cWell, that\u2019s why I told you that you can\u2019t do it.\u201dThe King of Essence\u2019s abilities aren\u2019t just coldness. Inciting the primitive emotion of wrath is his real ability. Back in devildom, the number of devils who self-destructed from the King of Essence\u2019s incitation of wrath was over ten thousand\u2026\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t work against me, either.\u201dArrrrggh!Wrath\u2019s blue flame started to become red. He was about to explode, but he didn\u2019t start attacking again, since he seemed to dislike giving away free stats.\u201cIt\u2019s better now that it's silent.\u201dRaon nodded like nothing happened and opened his status window.Status WindowName: Raon Zieghart.Title: First Victory.State: Curse of Frost (Six Strands)Trait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Four-Stars), Water Resistance (Four-Stars), Perception of the Snow Flower (Two-Star), Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation (Two-Stars), Coldness of the Frost (Two-Stars), Fire Resistance (Two-Stars)\u2014Strength: 40Agility: 41Stamina: 41Energy: 29Perception: 53He immediately noticed that Decline in Athletic Abilities and Decline in Mana Affinity, which used to be anchored in the status window, were now gone.An irresistible smile appeared on his face.His body was so light he could fly, and he could feel the mana entering his body throughout his pores. It seemed there was a good reason for all that.\u2018My stats have also increased a lot.\u2019Each one of the stats had increased by at least two levels. His current physical abilities and perception weren\u2019t any worse than a proper swordsman.\u2018The \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 is a great harvest.\u2019Since his \u2018Water Resistance\u2019 was now four-stars, he could now easily endure magic on par with four-circles.The resistance was going to be more helpful with fighting mages or shamans, rather than swordsmen.\u2018I have gained a lot.\u2019The Nine Flowers Medicine was a good elixir, but he\u2019d obtained a lot more than that. It was to the point that he couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling, despite his cynical personality.\u2018Shall I try it out just a little bit?\u2019Since he wanted to test out how much his body and aura had changed, he opened the door.\u201cHuff!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dSylvia and Helen, who were standing in front of the door, hurriedly stepped back in surprise.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cN-no. Since you said you were cultivating, I was guarding\u2026\u201d\u201cSame goes for me.\u201dThey both had slightly bloodshot eyes. It looked like they had been guarding him the entire night, without even making a sound while breathing.As he widened his perception, he could see that there were other maids outside his window.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon closed his eyes. A warmth even greater than when he cultivated the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 warmed his heart.It even gave him the impression that the ice from his mana circuit had disappeared for a moment.\u201cThank you.\u201dHe lowered his head to them, and the other maids outside, feeling grateful and apologetic at the same time.\u201cSob!\u201d\u201cMadam!\u2019\u201cHe-Helen. What shall I do?\u201dSylvia collapsed to the side while bursting out in tears.\u201cMy son has grown up so well!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I wouldn\u2019t have any regrets even if I died right now! Madam!\u201d\u201cHelen!\u201dThe two of them sobbed while hugging each other.\u2018This is the hardest part.\u2019Rather than Wrath\u2019s emotional attack, the ice inside his mana circuit, or the pressure from Glenn Zieghart, he found it the most difficult to deal with Sylvia and Helen.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon quickly left the annex building while they were busy hugging each other.***Over the next two days, Raon finished getting used to his changed body.His body and perception had changed more than what he\u2019d seen in the status window.When he first practiced his swordsmanship, he thought it wasn\u2019t his body. Despite using the same technique, the power and speed were on a different level.And the reason it had changed so much was simple.His state had changed.The Decline in Athletic Abilities and the Decline in Mana Affinity disappearing from his state allowed his body to be at peak condition.His body moved exactly the way he wanted, and his mana\u2014which used to appear as thin as sand\u2014now felt as big as a bead.\u2018This is another foundation.\u2019Rather than his increased might, he felt more satisfied about hardening the foundation that would allow him to reach a higher level in martial arts.That was why he was taking care of flowers in the flower bed in the garden, taking a rest on his last day of holidays.You idiot. When you are thinning out the soil, you must dig out the bottom first. You must use your hand instead of a trowel to properly mix the nutritious soil.Wrath was unbecomingly knowledgeable about the flowers and trees. Thanks to him, he could manage the flower bed without having to look in a book.Back in devildom, the King of Essence once filled an entire flower bed with ice flowers. The devils that saw the flower bed lowered their heads to the flowers in respect. That was an expression of admiration and awe for the King of Essence\u2026\u201cHaa.\u201dIt would\u2019ve been better if he could stop babbling.Wrath really talked way too much. Especially when he started with the \u2018Back in devildom, the King of Essence\u2026\u2019, he could talk for at least ten minutes before stopping.After hearing about the devildom every day, he\u2019d started growing familiarity to the devildom that he\u2019d never been before.That\u2019s not it! You must treat the flowers delicately. If you can\u2019t, then freeze it first!\u201cI know, I know.\u201dRaon frowned and flicked his finger. When he carefully planted the flower, as if he were controlling mana, Wrath stopped preaching.It was when he was about to head to the left flower bed, after finishing the right side\u2026\u201cHmm?\u201dA thin shape was walking towards him from the entrance of the annex building. The long hair had been cut short, but it was impossible to not recognize her.Martha Zieghart.Martha, who\u2019d lost two days ago, was approaching him while frowning heavily.\u201cAre you here to pick a fight?\u201dRaon dusted off his dirty hands and stood up.That would be welcomed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And it was an extremely disgraceful defeat on top of that.She\u2019d twisted her own personality, became foul-mouthed and kept her distance from other people. But it was all pointless now that she lost with such an overwhelming difference.\u201cDamn it!\u201dHer foster father, Denier Zieghart, adopted her into the house Zieghart because he\u2019d recognized her talent.And yet, she lost to Raon Zieghart\u2014 a collateral that was one year younger than her. She couldn\u2019t predict the kind of measures her father would take as a result.Denier was a kind person, but that might\u2019ve been an act. She needed to take into consideration the possibility of getting chased out.\u2018No, I can never let that happen.\u2019If she got chased out, she\u2019d lose her last hope of finding her mother. She had to beg for that to not happen, even if she had to cling to his leg.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u201cMy lady.\u201dMartha was extremely nervous, to the extent that she didn\u2019t even turn back when her butler Camel called out to her.\u201cIt\u2019s a letter from Sir Denier.\u201dMartha finally turned around upon hearing that Denier Zieghart had sent her a letter. Her black pupils swayed like a wave.\u201cHere it is.\u201dMartha swallowed and opened the letter.Martha, congratulations on your first defeat. Don\u2019t worry too much, as one defeat will not gain you the label of a loser. However, reflect countless times on why you lost, and how you lost. That self-examination will become the basis for your future growth. I wanted to visit you personally and comfort you, but my mission is taking longer than I thought. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be with you.It wasn\u2019t blame or mockery. It was a letter sent from a father who was worried about his daughter from the bottom of his heart.I\u2019m still investigating your birth mother. Since I still haven\u2019t given up on it, you shall not give up either.Martha folded the letter with trembling hands and put it in her pocket. She tried pressing the pocket, as if she were checking her wallet.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe letter was putting the broken pieces of her mind back together. The last part especially made her depression and anxiety, which used to press down on her shoulders, fly away.\u201cTell father that I\u2019ll bear it in mind. And that I\u2019m really, really grateful.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dCamel nodded, smiling lightly.\u201cBy the way, my lady.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cIf you are worried about the obedience that was wagered during the spar with young master Raon, it can be solved by pressuring the annex building. It can be silently taken care of, using the direct line\u2019s authority\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t do it.\u201dMartha shook her head definitely. Her pupils, resembling black pearls, shone with a clear light that was missing before.\u201cThe fact remains that I lost, and in the most miserable way, at that.\u201dShe knew better than anyone the reason that she lost to Raon.\u2018The defeat wasn\u2019t because of my carelessness. I simply lost, that\u2019s all.\u2019Raon sliced through her sword using that red aura. Since a swordsman had lost her sword, the victor was already decided at that point.And yet, he threw away his own sword and fought her a second time, using his fists.If she acted shamefully towards someone who\u2019d fought her like that, her father would be more disappointed in her.\u201cA Zieghart should keep their promise, even if it is a stupid one. I\u2019m sure Father would say the same thing.\u201d\u201cCertainly. Sir Denier would\u2019ve said the same.\u201d\u201cAs a daughter, I can\u2019t bring shame upon him.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dCamel visibly lifted the corners of his mouth and laughed, as if he were praising her.\u201cCamel, do you have a knife?\u201d\u201cYes, I do. But why\u2026?\u201d\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\u201cHere it is.\u201dMartha stared at the thin dagger Camel handed over for a while, then unsheathed it.Whack!Nodding with determination, she cut her ebony hair from the middle without hesitating.\u201cMy\u2026 My lady!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m parting with my idiotic and ugly self from before.\u201dMartha smiled, letting the cut hair fly away with the wind. Her smile was shining like a snowflake.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dCamel gasped, since he hadn\u2019t expected that to happen.\u201cPlease cancel the direct line training tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cPardon? It\u2019s not difficult to cancel it, but what are you planning to do\u2026\u201d\u201cI have somewhere to go.\u201dMartha declared, entering the mansion.Watching her back as she entered the mansion, Camel nodded kindly.***After finishing the daybreak training on the last day of the holidays, she immediately left her mansion.Evading Camel and the maids, who were asking where she was going without even taking her breakfast, she went towards the annex building in the west alone.It was pretty far away, but since the road was nicely paved, she could find it without any difficulty.As she kept walking to the west, she could see a small house surrounded by a small garden.\u2018Does he live there?\u2019Martha furrowed her brows, as it was small and shabby compared to the structures in the main building.However, since the house she used to live in before she was adopted was way smaller than the annex building, it didn\u2019t incite any other emotion from her. She didn\u2019t care and kept walking towards the garden.\u2018Somebody is there.\u2019A blond body was squatting down at the flower bed, digging the ground and planting flowers.\u2018Huh?\u2019Martha\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018Raon Zieghart?\u2019She\u2019d thought he was a servant, but he wasn\u2019t. The one who was planting flowers was Raon Zieghart, who made her taste defeat for the first time.Raon dusted off his hands and stood up. It looked like he noticed her as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha didn\u2019t respond, standing in front of the flower bed that Raon was taking care of. The flowers looked fresh and healthy, probably because he\u2019d just watered them.\u2018He has this kind of hobby?\u2019She\u2019d thought he was too precocious, so she was surprised at finding a childish side to him.\u2018What should I do?\u2019The reason that Martha visited Raon was simple.She wanted a rematch.She kept thinking about her defeat after reading her father\u2019s advice, but she couldn\u2019t remember how she lost.Since she couldn\u2019t remember, she had no idea how large the difference in abilities was between them, and whether there was any way of making up for it or not.In short, she couldn\u2019t reflect.Therefore, she needed a rematch.She wanted to determine the difference between her and Raon by fighting him with a clear mind.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dMartha sighed heavily and lifted her head. She carefully opened her mouth while looking into Raon\u2019s eyes, which were as calm as a lake.\u201cI want to try fighting you again.\u201d\u201cNot admitting defeat is a bit disturbing.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not refusing to admit to having lost so easily. I just can\u2019t tell how I lost, and I came looking for you in order to figure that out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes shone for a second. He seemed to think it was unexpected.\u201cThen, what\u2019s the offer?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFor a loser to challenge the victor once again, you\u2019d have to give something away, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHell no! You don\u2019t need a prize in order to fight!\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dMartha groaned lightly.\u2018This is why.\u2019Because he never wanted to come out at a loss, she\u2019d felt like Raon wasn\u2019t actually a child.\u201cYou don\u2019t have one? It\u2019s troublesome if you don\u2019t.\u201dRaon crossed his arms, showing that he had no intention of fighting.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u2018What shall I do?\u2019 Martha thought as she looked at Raon, biting her lip. Then she looked at the flowers below.\u2018Shall I try stepping on it a little?\u2019Since he was taking care of the flower bed at that hour, he must\u2019ve loved the flowers. If she provoked him by harming them a little, he would probably attack her.\u201cYou must like the flowers, although that doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201dMartha secretly moved her foot towards the flower bed.\u201cNot really.\u201dDespite her expectations, Raon shook his head while tapping his trowel.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said I don\u2019t like flowers, and I don\u2019t understand why people like them either. I was only taking care of them because of my mother.\"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha, who was about to step on the flowers, suddenly stopped.\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you going to step on them?\u201dRaon tilted his head while smiling slightly. It seemed he was already aware of her intentions.\u201cDamn it.\u201dMartha cursed and pulled back her feet. Hearing that he\u2019d been taking care of the flowers for his mother, who loved the flowers, she didn\u2019t feel like stepping on them anymore.\u201cShit.\u201dShe clicked her tongue. As she was about to turn around, the annex building\u2019s door opened and a beautiful woman with her long hair tied back ran out towards them.\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes, which were as cold as ice, were suddenly flustered.\u201cMo-mother.\u201d\u201cI was wondering why I couldn\u2019t find you, but you were taking care of the flower bed for me. But who is this, a friend of yours?\u201dHer eyes were filled with curiosity.\u2018Is she Sylvia Zieghart?\u2019The woman who left the household in order to be with her beloved, then returned in order to save her child. She was the family\u2019s disgrace and was said to belong in the trash.Maybe it was because she\u2019d had a similar experience, but she didn\u2019t look like trash to Martha, but a courageous mother who lived for the sake of her beloved child.\u201cSh-she\u2019s not a friend, she is nothing. I\u2019ll handle it here, so please go back.\u201dIt was a rare sight to see Raon stuttering.\u201cShe is also pretty. Black hair and black pupils? Ah! You\u2019re Martha!\u201dSylvia smiled brightly while clapping her hands.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha silently nodded.\u201cI heard you sparred with Raon, were you hurt anywhere?\u201dSince they were similar to the mother that she missed so much, she could tell that Sylvia\u2019s rose-colored eyes held real worry about her wellbeing.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cThank god, I was worried.\u201dSylvia smiled lightly.\u201cI heard big brother Denier had brought in a very talented child, but there was more to it.\u201dShe thoroughly examined her, and told her that she was really pretty, too pretty.\u201cBut what brought you here?\u201d\u201cI had something to tell him. I\u2019ll return since I\u2019m done now.\u201dMartha bowed her head and was about to leave.Growl.The result of skipping breakfast after her daybreak training occurred.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMartha\u2019s face turned completely red. When she was about to run away, something warm caught her hand.It was Sylvia. She flicked her finger while smiling.\u201cLet\u2019s eat before you go.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why, but Martha couldn\u2019t shake off that thin hand of hers.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *What was this?Raon furrowed his brows, looking at Martha, who was sitting across from him at the dining table.\u2018I don\u2019t even know anymore.\u2019He could understand Sylvia inviting Martha to eat before she left after hearing Martha\u2019s stomach growling, since Sylvia is a very kind person.However, for that crazy girl to be led to the table and modestly wait for the food to be brought out was something unimaginable for him.Maybe when she cut her hair, she also cut out her bad temper.\u201cRaon loves meat stews. That\u2019s why we always have at least one stew on the menu.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dSylvia kept smiling. Raon wondered what she was so happy about, and Martha kept responding with a lowered head, as if she was embarrassed.What is that girl doing? Wasn\u2019t her personality different?\u2018I don\u2019t know what's going on either.\u2019This was the first time since he\u2019d been born into house Zieghart that he\u2019d encountered such an unexpected situation.The food was brought out soon enough. They were stews, roast beef, vegetables, and baked bread.\u201cYou are one year older than Raon, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you having any difficulty with training?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u2019Sylvia kept talking to Martha while dining, and Martha also kept answering immediately, despite eating.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dRaon tilted his head.\u2018Seriously, what\u2019s up with her?\u2019The first thing Martha would do when someone talked to her was swear. He\u2019d never imagined seeing her acting so favorably.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon gulped down the stew, unable to tell if he was consuming it through his mouth or his nose.\u201cWe are very good at cooking, but the quality of the meat is a bit worse than the main building. Make sure to chew it well to digest it better.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha\u2019s hand, which was holding the fork, trembled upon hearing Sylvia\u2019s advice.Since she could start rampaging soon, Raon readied himself to stop her. However, she lowered her head once again and started eating.Raon wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about human emotions, but he felt like Martha\u2019s hands were expressing some kind of sorrow and yearning.\u201cThank you for the meal.\u201dThe awkward meal finally ended, and Martha stood up.\u201cHow was the taste?\u201d\u201cIt was tasty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. Please be friends with Raon from now on.\u201dSylvia stood in front of the door, waving her hand at Martha.\u201cYes.\u201dMartha unexpectedly gave a normal answer and left the annex building.\u2018Seriously, what was that?\u2019She clearly came to pick a fight with him, so he couldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d suddenly started acting like that.Did she eat something off?\u2018Probably.\u2019Human emotion was really difficult to understand.***As soon as she left the annex building, Martha bit her lip. She felt like she was going to cry otherwise.She looked similar.Her face, the color of her hair, the clothes she was wearing, and even her voice was different. However, those rose-colored eyes were too similar to her missing mother.That was why she couldn\u2019t shake her off when she caught her hand.Raon must\u2019ve thought she was crazy.It was the first time she saw his eyes shivering so much.She\u2019d considered leaving, but she was glad she stayed to finish her meal. Sylvia\u2019s gentle gaze and voice, and\u2026When she heard her telling to chew it well, which was the nagging that her mother used to give all the time, Martha really felt like she was with her mother.That was why she wanted to find her mother even more now.\u2018White Blood Religion, those sons of bitches.\u2019The ones that took away her mother were the White Blood Religion, one of the five demons. She was going to find her mother at all costs, even if she had to kill all those fanatics.Resolving herself over and over, Martha returned to the main building.\u201cMy lady, where have you been\u2026 Huh? No way, were you crying?\u201dCamel, who was sweeping in front of the door, widened his eyes.\u201cWhat are you talking about?! I would never do that!\u201dMartha wiped away her tears and shook her head. She quickly opened the door and was entered the mansion, but then she stuck her head out.\u201cCamel, can you get some high-quality beef for me?\u201d\u201cBeef? Of course I can. But what are you going to use it for?\u201d\u201cI need it for something, so leave it in front of my room once you get it!\u201dMartha responded, then immediately closed the door and ran up to her room.\u201cHaha.\u201dCamel gently smiled while watching her.\u201cI wonder if she realizes she looks a lot better now than before.\u201d***The next day, Raon was headed towards the training ground as soon as he finished his daybreak cultivation. Like always, he was the first one to arrive.His head was filled with various thoughts because of Martha visiting him the day before, but he decided to think of it as a silly dream.After a light warm up, he started to train the \u2018Combination Sword\u2019. As the sun rose, the children started to enter the training ground one after another.While he was swinging his sword and listening to the trainees' idle chatters, everyone suddenly fell silent.When he turned his head around, Martha was walking in through the training ground\u2019s wide-open doors.The trainees were staring at her with their jaws dropped, probably because of her short hair.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dMartha stopped in front of Raon.\u201cI can\u2019t retrieve the words I have already spoken. I\u2019m not going to try making up for everything I\u2019ve done so far with some kind of sloppy apology.\u201dHer eyes were even calmer than the day before. They looked like a motionless lake.\u201cBut I\u2019ll keep my promise.\u201d\u201cPromise?\u201d\u201cThe promise that we made before the spar, that the loser would obey the winner.\u201dShe turned around after saying that. Her eyes were saying that she\u2019d completely admitted her defeat.\u2018It\u2019s bigger than I thought\u2026\u2019For her to change in such a short period of time, she wasn\u2019t the average narrow-hearted person. Although, he still couldn\u2019t understand why she stayed for the meal the day before.\u201cWhy the hell are you blocking my way? Fuck off!\u201dWhile Raon was tilting his head, Martha kicked away Dorian, who was awkwardly standing in front of her.\u201cAww! So-sorry.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dShe clicked her tongue and returned to her usual seat.Raon smirked. It looked like her attitude towards him was the only thing that had changed.\u2018I knew that everyone here wasn\u2019t normal.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38The new year had started.Raon\u2019s life\u2014at 14 years old\u2014could be summarized in one word. Training. He continued the life of a training demon that arrived at the training ground before anyone else and left it later than anyone.Runaan\u2019s eyes were still blank, but the sharpness of her sword and the coldness of her water attribute aura became incomparably better.Burren, who grew up a lot mentally, had now captivated the trainees' hearts. He kept swinging his sword day and night in preparation for the day that he would reclaim the title of top trainee.As for Martha, she kept swinging her sword and cultivating her aura without rest in order to wipe away the stain of her first defeat.One problem was that her personality, which was already bad enough, became even more violent. Nobody even wanted to approach her anymore.However, she acted differently towards one person: Raon Zieghart.Despite not even listening to the instructors properly, Martha obeyed whatever Raon told her without complaint. She even looked like a faithful servant to bystanders.The trainees knew that it was the result of the bet, so they thought her attitude wasn\u2019t going to last for more than several days.They were wrong.Even in the new year, Martha kept honestly obeying Raon\u2019s words.Everyone was surprised.They\u2019d never imagined the foul-mouthed and ill-tempered Martha was going to keep her promise to Raon.As such, Raon made the last disruptor submit and was acknowledged by every trainee in the fifth training ground.***\u201cGather.\u201dAt Raon\u2019s call, all the trainees that were warming up everywhere in the training ground looked at him at once.\u201cTsk.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dBurren clicked his tongue lightly and came to stand in front of Raon. Runaan trotted towards him like a puppy that saw its owner.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes were full of bloodlust, but she stood next to them without saying anything.Since Runaan, Burren, and Martha\u2014who were the most influential people on the training ground\u2014listened to Raon\u2019s instruction, the other trainees naturally followed them.\u201cWhy did you ask us to gather?\u201dBurren raised his head and looked at the empty platform.\u201cWe are supposed to do personal training this morning.\u201d\u201cNo, it's regular training today.\u201d\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that.\u201d\u201cThe head instructor said he forgot to tell us.\u201dRaon sighed. Rimmer had visited him the evening before to ask him to gather the trainees in the morning.\u201cThat man is just so\u2026\u201dBurren grinded his teeth. He still seemed to dislike Rimmer.\u201cAnyway, wait here for now since it\u2019s regular training today. Just warm up for now.\u201d\u201cPff.\u201d\u201cWhy is he so forgetful? Is he getting senile?\u201d\u201cHe was probably messing around and ended up drunk. I heard he went to a bar yesterday.\u201d\u201cIt happens all the time, let\u2019s just get ourselves ready.\u201dThe trainees complained a bit, but they started warming up at the center of the training ground, following Raon\u2019s instructions.About five minutes later, the door to the training ground creaked open and the instructors entered.\u201cYawwwn.\u201dRimmer, who was at the very back, yawned so hard that he couldn\u2019t even hide his mouth with his hand and walked up on the platform.\u201cYou are late, instructor.\u201dBurren raised his hand and shouted.\u201cEh, it\u2019s supposed to be personal training today, but since the instructors arrived late because we were preparing for you all, we aren\u2019t exactly late.\u201d\u201cThat has nothing to do with th\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, since we are late, let\u2019s start training right away!\u201dRimmer ignored Burren and waved his hand.Raon could hear Burren grinding his teeth from behind. Their relationship didn\u2019t seem to change.\u201cThe reason we took away your personal training time today is in order to hand you the most important thing for a swordsman.\u201d\u201cTh-the most important thing for a swordsman?\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cA new swordsmanship?\u201d\u201cA secret technique?\u201d\u201cA cultivation technique?\u201dThe trainees\u2019 eyes glittered, full of expectations.\u201cHmph!\u201dAfter enjoying their gazes for a while, Rimmer opened his mouth once their excited voices subsided.\u201cIt\u2019s footwork.\u201d\u201cEek?\u201d\u201cFootwork?\u201d\u201cWhy is that the most important thing for a swordsman\u2026?\u201d\u201cHaah, I knew it.\u201dHearing that it was about footwork, the trainees stamped their feet in disappointment.\u2018I knew it, it was footwork.\u2019Raon nodded calmly.Footwork was the way of walking.It was a systematic method developed in order to make the swordsmanship or fist technique more offensive, defensive or simply faster.\u2018I was thinking it was about time.\u2019Since he got used to both swordsmanship and fist techniques, and the aura had already developed to a certain extent, he thought it was the right moment to start learning footwork.\u201cMany people learn intermediate level swordsmanship before coming here, but it\u2019s very rare for them to have learned proper footwork.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThe trainees slowly nodded, unable to refute it. Burren, Runaan, and Martha remained silent.\u201cSince your goal is to become swordsmen, swordsmanship is indeed important. However!\u201dRimmer grinned and jumped down from the platform. His body disappeared like a blown-out candlelight.\u201cWhat makes the swordsmanship sharper and faster, and what will save your life in the future? It\u2019s footwork, also known as, the movement of your feet.\u201dHis voice was heard from behind. When Raon turned around, Rimmer, who had disappeared in front of him, was standing behind him with his hands folded behind his back.\u201cHuff!\u201d\u201cWh-when\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201dThe trainees\u2019 jaws dropped. The way Rimmer had appeared behind them without making any sound filled them with amazement.\u201cYou must\u2019ve realized during the spar that training on your own and having an opponent to fight against are quite different.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cTrue. I couldn\u2019t move my body the way I wanted.\u201d\u201cThe sword wasn\u2019t following the correct trajectory either.\u201dThe trainees nodded, since they\u2019d all realized during the spar that a real fight was different from training.\u201cIf you want to do your best in a real battle, you have to train your footwork more than your swordsmanship. In my opinion, the most important thing during a one-on-one spar isn\u2019t swordsmanship or aura, but footwork. Even the head of house agreed with me on that.\u201d\u201cTh-the head of house?\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cIf my lord said that\u2026\u201dThe trainees opened their mouths wide. Since Glenn\u2014who was the most respected person to them\u2014said that the footwork was important, they were immediately convinced, unlike when Rimmer said it.\u201cFootwork\u2026\u201dBurren straightened his spine.\u2018Yes, if I could use footwork back then\u2026\u2019His strengths were sharpness, precision, and speed. When he fought against Raon back then, if he could use proper footwork then he wouldn\u2019t have lost so easily.\u201cI see\u2026\u201dBurren turned his head, hearing a growling voice.Martha\u2019s eyes were shining while clenching her fist. She seemed to be thinking the same thing.\u2018We are the same.\u2019He\u2019d thought Martha had become silent, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Instead of showing it on the outside, Martha has been burning with passion to defeat Raon on the inside.\u201cWe will start with the River Footwork, which incorporates the flow of a river.\u201dWhen Rimmer bounced his legs lightly, as if he were walking on a gravelly field next to a river, his body suddenly leaped to the platform.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAfter getting into the posture to demonstrate the footwork, he murmured that it was bothersome and laid down.\u201cSkilled assistant, come forth.\u201dWhen Rimmer clapped his hands, the instructor who was standing behind him came up and started to demonstrate the River Footwork\u2019s postures.Crack.Burren clenched his fist. He resolved himself that, by mastering the footwork, he would one day teach that lazy instructor a lesson. He would thoroughly remember the River Footwork\u2019s postures.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The River Footwork only had twelve forms, and the postures were simple enough that the demonstration didn\u2019t take too long.\u2018This is literally the basics.\u2019Since Raon was rotating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, he could grasp the form, posture, and flow of River Footwork at a glance.Although it was his first time seeing it, it was faithful to the basics, and the flexible flow could be applied in any other technique.\u201cThe instructors will move around and correct your postures, so try repeating the footwork the way you\u2019ve seen and felt it.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees spread out throughout the training ground and started to perform the River Footwork.However, Raon didn\u2019t move.Rotating his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 with his eyes closed, he replayed the River Footwork the instructor had shown in his head.\u2018Six in defense and four in attack.\u2019As expected of basic footwork, the River Footwork was evenly distributed between attack and defense. It was slightly more defensive, but there wasn\u2019t a big difference.\u2018The sequence is its strong point.\u2019The River Footwork\u2019s characteristic was its flow, which was as smooth as a river. Rather than repeating it exactly the way it was demonstrated, it was more important to continue the flow, even if he\u2019d end up losing the posture a little.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon breathed out excitedly and opened his eyes, and everything about the River Footwork came into his view.Tap .He first moved his right foot forward.Enjoying the sensation of pressing down on the well-prepared floor of the training ground, he moved his left foot.The moment the two feet naturally crossed each other, Fluidity, the first form of River Footwork was performed.Pow!Grazing the ground, he rotated his body to his right. It was a movement to evade an enemy\u2019s attack, and to thrust one\u2019s sword. The second form \u2018Discharge\u2019 reverberated the sand on the ground.The performance was closer to perfection than the instructor\u2019s demonstration.Zzzt!Raon smiled, a feeling of pleasure running up his shoulders. His feet renewed their flexible flow, as if his feet had known the River Footwork from the moment he was born.***\u201cYawwwwwwn!\u201dRimmer yawned so hard that his mouth looked like it would tear apart.\u201cI\u2019m so sleepy.\u201dHe didn\u2019t manage to sleep for a few days because he\u2019d been looking for an appropriate footwork for the trainees, then supplemented it. As a result, his entire body felt exhausted.\u2018I guess I\u2019m getting old now.\u2019He smirked and looked down at the platform.Raon, who was standing at the center, had his eyes closed without doing anything. It looked like he was imagining the instructor\u2019s demonstration in his head.\u2018That\u2019s a good way to go\u2026\u2019Imagining a martial art in the head was indeed an efficient way of training. However, that could only be done once he was more qualified.Since he\u2019d just learned about footwork, he should\u2019ve moved his body rather than trying to imagine it.\u2018I should tell him to stop goofing around later.\u2019Rimmer murmured that he had something to make fun of and looked towards Burren.\u2018He is pretty good.\u2019Burren almost completely reenacted the River Footwork\u2019s flow, and it looked like he must\u2019ve experienced learning footwork before. He didn\u2019t grasp the true meaning, but he should\u2019ve been able to master the posture pretty soon.\u2018And she is the same.\u2019Martha was also rotating her body with light steps, like someone who\u2019d been learning footwork for a long time. Her posture was actually a lot better than Burren\u2019s.\u201cHah.\u201dRimmer smirked, watching Burren and Martha\u2019s footwork.\u2018They must be thinking about Raon.\u2019They were thinking about their spars with Raon as they learned their footwork.It looked like he\u2019d managed to convince them by telling them that the most important thing in a duel was footwork.\u2018And\u2026\u2019He looked at Runaan, who was practicing River Footwork on the right side. Her movement was different from the other two.A movement that seemed to assist, rather than facing an opponent. It was pretty obvious who she wanted to help.After that, Rimmer looked through everyone, remembering the strength and weaknesses that he was going to tell them.\u2018Interesting.\u2019Since they were still young and pure, he could tell what they were thinking about just from watching them practice.\u201cAwwww.\u201dRimmer stretched like a bear that had just woken up from its hibernation and stood up.Sparkle.When he was about to give his comments to the trainees, Raon, who\u2019d been standing still like a stone statue, opened his eyes and moved his foot to the back.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019He got goosebumps from the look in his clear red eyes, and his foot extended straight like a crane\u2019s.Raon\u2019s feet slowly advanced. The first form \u2018Fluidity\u2019 flowed across the training ground\u2019s floor, incorporating the flow of a River.Pow!He took the second posture. Advancing like a fire, his movement seemed to reflect the appearance of a sharp blade.\u201cHah!\u201dRimmer was at a loss for words.\u2018That guy\u2026\u2019Raon\u2019s \u2018Fluidity\u2019 was more complete than the instructor that had taught him the footwork.After that, Raon performed the twelve forms of the River Footwork without interruption. The posture was close to perfection, without a single mistake.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-what is that?''The trainees and instructors alike stood still and watched Raon\u2019s footwork.\u201cDid he just learn the footwork from his mental image?\u201dRimmer\u2019s hands trembled, and goosebumps appeared throughout his body.\u2018When is that monster going to stop surprising me\u2026?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39\u201cHuff.\u201dAfter performing all twelve forms of the River Footwork, Raon exhaled lightly.\u2018That was pretty good.\u2019His body moved exactly the way he\u2019d imagined, following the flow and posture he\u2019d wanted.It felt like watching himself from a third person\u2019s point of view.It seemed that using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 to understand the flow before moving his body was going to be a pretty good way of learning martial arts in the future.\u201cHmm?\u201dRaon furrowed his brows. The training ground should\u2019ve been noisy with everyone training their footwork, yet it was as silent as a library.Raon felt a strange gaze from behind and turned around.\u201cCrazy\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-what\u2026?\u201dBurren and Martha were both out of their mind with their mouths wide open, and Runaan waved her clenched hand. From the movement of her mouth, he could tell that she was asking him to teach her.It wasn\u2019t just the three of them. Every trainee and instructor alike had their eyes so wide that they were about to pop out.\u201cWhy are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cRaon.\u201dRaon turned around once again to the surprised voice calling out to him. Rimmer, who used to be lying on the platform, was standing in front of him.\u201cDid you know the River Footwork?\u201dHis green pupils were lightly oscillating, like a freshly strummed harp\u2019s cord. He was clearly surprised.\u201cNo, that was my first time seeing it.\u201dIt was similar to the shadow footwork he\u2019d learned in his previous life, but he\u2019d never even heard about River Footwork.\u201cThen how\u2026\u201dRimmer skipped lots of details, but Raon understood what he wanted to ask because of his expression.\u201cHow shall I explain it?\u201dRaon slightly smiled, while scratching his neck.\u201cI could read the flow.\u201d\u201cRead the flow?\u201d\u201cYes. When the instructor was demonstrating the footwork, I saw its flow, instead of the postures and their order.\u201dThe River footwork had a similar flow to the Shadow footwork he\u2019d learned in his previous life. That was why he\u2019d managed to figure it out rather easily.\u201cInstead of looking at a tree, I looked at the forest. That\u2019s how I managed to understand its flow.\u201d\u201cHuh. Wow.\u201dRimmer simply grabbed his head and exclaimed. It looked like he was at a loss for words.\u201cI thought it\u2019d take at least a week.\u201dHe murmured that he didn\u2019t think the footwork he\u2019d finally managed to find with such difficulty would be finished so easily.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, no. That\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. I\u2019m just surprised, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon secretly licked his lips.\u2018Did I do it too fast?\u2019The moment he saw the footwork he\u2019d felt exhilarated, so he reenacted it. He didn\u2019t think Rimmer would be so surprised by that.\u2018Well, I was also pretty confident in my footwork in my previous life.\u2019As an assassin, his might wasn\u2019t on par with a Master, but his footwork was one thing that didn\u2019t lose to a Master\u2019s.To be surprised by those mere steps, humans are really pathetic. Back in devildom, the King of Essence created the \u2018Ice Flower Step\u2019, in which a single step could freeze an entire mountain and ocean\u2026\u2018Ah, sure.\u2019Raon tapped away Wrath, who suddenly started boasting about himself.\u201cAhem.\u201dClearing his throat, Rimmer turned around with his hands behind his back.\u201cWell, you certainly did well for your first time, but your posture is still lacking. The flow is fine, so pay attention to the forms. You can ask the other instructors questions, except for me.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRaon nodded and turned around. Certainly, he felt like he could do a lot better since it was his first time doing it.\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cW-we have to teach that?\u201d\u201cI think he is better than me\u2026\u201dThe instructors shook their heads with long faces, brows furrowed until it looked like their eyebrows were reaching their cheeks.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After the River Footwork training, Martha left the training ground alongside with Camel.\u201cThat footwork looked pretty decent.\u201dCamel smiled while scratching his chin.\u201cIt\u2019s suitable to serve as the basis for the footwork that the master will hand down to you. It would be better to learn it properly.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dMartha nodded lightly, walking towards the main building.\u201cMy lady, did something happen?\u201dCamel felt like she was different from usual, so he walked right next to her.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dMartha, who was staying silent, turned her head with a frown.\u201cHow difficult was that footwork to learn?\u201d\u201cHmm, it was basic footwork for sure, but it\u2019s not exactly easy to learn. The flow was rather complicated.\u201dCamel closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them again.\u201cSince my lady is also talented in footwork, three days should be enough to understand its flow.\u201d\u201cThree days? Fuck\u2026\u201dMartha shook her head with dumbfounded expressions.\u201cMy lady?\u201d\u201cThen, is it possible for a trainee to learn it at once?\u201d\u201cA capable warrior would be able to copy it as soon as they saw it, but it\u2019s impossible for a trainee. They lack theory, knowledge, and experience. In short, their martial art is simply too shallow.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s a guy who did it.\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean\u2026?\u201dCamel\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018Was that possible?\u2019Although the River Footwork\u2019s steps were pretty basic, its flow was still very refined.It was impossible for a trainee to grasp it right away, unless they were a monster that\u2019d been learning martial arts ever since they were born.He saw Martha, who still looked surprised.That expression reminded him of one trainee.\u201cNo way. Did the young master Raon do that?\u201d\u201cWho else can it be except for that crazy guy?\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201dCamel covered his mouth to stop himself from cursing.\u201cCan you explain the situation?\u201d\u201cAfter the demonstration ended, everyone started to practice. He was just standing still with his eyes closed. He opened his eyes when the training was about to end, and then\u2026\u201dMartha described everything about that surprising scene in the training ground.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dCamel shook his head.\u2018He is nuts.\u2019He stayed still for a while with his eyes closed, which meant he learned the River Footwork in his head.\u2018He can use mental imaging at his age\u2026\u2019He\u2019d thought Raon was slightly talented, just enough to make the annex building receive a sliver of light.However, that wasn\u2019t the case.Raon Zieghart was a monster that could become a bridge to connect the main building\u2019s light to the annex building.\u2018I have to report this right away.\u2019That was very important information. He needed to tell Denier about it right after walking Martha to the main building.\u201cHmm?\u201dHe suddenly realized he couldn\u2019t see Martha anymore. When he turned around, she was following from behind with her head lowered.\u2018Tsk, I was too inconsiderate.\u2019It hadn\u2019t been long since she\u2019d lost to Raon, so he needed to be more thoughtful.\u201cMy lady, the young master Raon and my lady have different kinds of talents. It\u2019s not about which one is better\u2026\u201dWhile comforting her, Camel closed his mouth after meeting her eyes as she raised her head.\u2018Those eyes.\u2019Martha\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t those of a loser.They were the eyes of a challenger.They were the eyes of a beast that would prey on whoever was running ahead.And they were the same eyes he\u2019d seen back in the White Blood Religion\u2019s branch office, where he\u2019d first seen her.\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dMartha smiled devilishly.\u201cThe guy that won against me isn\u2019t a fake.\u201dThe bloody smile appearing on top of her graceful figure was an ominous sight.\u2018I was mistaken.\u2019Camel swallowed. Martha wasn\u2019t disappointed by her lack of talent compared to Raon.She was exhilarated at the thought of beating Raon, who was stronger and more talented than her.Martha wasn\u2019t the kind of person he needed to worry about or be considerate to.\u201cMy lady.\u201dCamel bowed his head and Martha walked past him.Her small but confident back seemed to show him her future.The fiercely beautiful swordsman, looking down on the world from the throne.***\u201c...That\u2019s what happened. Does it make any sense that a child of his age learned the footwork in his head? My lord\u2019s grandson must be a genius!\u201dRimmer grinned, looking at the tiger rock at the Northern Grave Mountain where they\u2019d usually meet.\u201cAre you his butler or something? You only talk about him whenever we meet.\u201dA dignified voice came from the top of the rock, and Glenn\u2019s expressionless face appeared.\u201cI\u2019m just satisfying my lord\u2019s curiosity.\u201dRimmer didn\u2019t stop smiling despite Glenn\u2019s cold atmosphere.\u201cAren\u2019t you surprised that your grandson learned the footwork with mental image?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t really be a mental image. You must be at least the highest grade, Expert, in order to learn a martial art with mental image.\u201dGlenn waved his hand dismissively, but he couldn\u2019t hide the slightly vibrating corners of his lips.\u201cJust as he said, he must\u2019ve read the flow of the footwork by looking at the forest instead of a tree. River Footwork\u2019s core is the flow, after all.\u201d\u201cEven so, isn\u2019t that amazing? Who else could do that?!\u201d\u201c......\u201dGlenn didn\u2019t respond. With his hands clasped at his back, he kept staring towards the main building below the mountain.\u201cYou must be overjoyed. I\u2019m glad I came to tell you about it.\u201dRimmer checked Glenn\u2019s expression with a furtive glance and smiled.\u201cSilence. If you finished talking, go away. You should pay more attention to the other children, like I\u2019ve always said.\u201d\u201cDo you not trust me? I\u2019m the Sword of Light. The Sword of Light. Of course you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of Sword of Light is a dying man?\u201dGlenn shook his hand to express his annoyance, but Rimmer leaned his back towards the tiger rock instead of leaving.\u201cHmm, the servants in the main building look rather busy. Are they preparing for something?\u201dRimmer whistled, looking at the people in the main building actively running around.\u201cIt\u2019s not a preparation, but there will be some visitors.\u201d\u201cThere are going to be visitors?\u201d\u201cThe envoys from Owen Kingdom will be coming in a few days.\u201d\u201cOwen Kingdom\u2019s envoys\u2026\u201dRimmer furrowed his brows. As a kingdom located at the center of the continent, Owen was one of the Six Kings along with Zieghart.\u201cI see.\u201dNot many forces maintained a favorable relationship with Zieghart. That\u2019s why he thought it was weird for there to be a visitor, but it ended up being the Owen Kingdom, which was somewhat close to them.\u201cWho is the leader of the envoys?\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s the third prince. Well, it should actually be Duke Tartan.\u201d\u201cOh, that crazy bastard became a duke in the end?\u201dRimmer smiled brutally, hearing the name Tartan.\u201cOh? Wait! Isn\u2019t the third prince of Karten still pretty young? He should be at the same age as Raon or Burren\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, since I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRimmer nodded. Unless the king himself came as an envoy, there was no need for Glenn to care.\u201cOrder the trainees to maintain a tidy appearance since they could be seen at any time.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d\u201cThe third prince is coming along with the knight trainees in the kingdom, and they said they wanted to witness the training of swordsmen and trainees.\u201d\u201cAnd did you allow that?\u201d\u201cOf course I did.\u201dGlenn\u2019s thick red gaze was directed at Rimmer.\u201cBeing seen doesn\u2019t make Zieghart\u2019s sword weaker. We never hide, nor run.\u201d\u201c...I haven\u2019t heard that for a long time.\u201dRimmer murmured that he used to hear that every day and smiled bitterly.\u201cGo away now that you are satisfied. You are the head instructor, so how long are you planning to be absent from the training ground?\u201dGlenn frowned, lowering the corners of his lips.\u201cYep!\u201dRimmer bowed after raising his hand, as if he were saluting. He turned around and started going down the mountain, then suddenly stopped.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe licked his lips while watching the fifth training ground from afar.\u2018The third prince and knight trainees, huh\u2026\u2019Knowing that the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoy had people at Raon\u2019s age, he suddenly got a great idea.Rimmer turned around at Glenn, and grinned.\u201cYour face, you\u2019ve come up with some strange idea again.\u201dGlenn frowned, as if he saw something unsightly.\u201cNo, it won\u2019t be strange.\u201dRimmer grinned like an old fox and shook his head.\u201cBecause it will be helpful to the young Zieghart\u2019s sprouts.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40A silver line was flowing through the white snow, falling down like a torrent. It was the march of armored knights.\u201cAre you okay, my lord prince?\u201dA middle-aged man with a huge, bear-like build looked at the boy walking right next to him.\u201cI\u2019m still fine. But the knight trainees seem to be struggling because it\u2019s snowing more heavily than expected.\u201dThe prince turned around. Unlike the composed prince, the knight trainees clearly looked tired.\u201cIs Zieghart still far away?\u201d\u201cIt looks like we are almost there, since this heavy snow is getting worse.\u201d\u201cAlmost there? Then do Zieghart\u2019s swordsmen endure this snow every day?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the case.\u201dThe middle-aged knight shook his head while smiling lightly.\u201cThe weather becomes worse the closer we get to the Zieghart, but\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said that, the violent snow suddenly stopped, and the sun hiding behind the gray cloud finally appeared.\u201cThe weather inside Zieghart is perfectly clear. The temperature is lower, though.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dThe prince looked up at the sky in surprise. It was so clear that he felt like the endless snowstorm was just a dream.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cTh-the snow stopped immediately.\u201dThe others\u2019 jaws also dropped.\u201cDuke Tartan, what is this weather\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt looks like magic, but it isn\u2019t. This strange natural environment is the reason that Zieghart is called a natural fortress.\u201dThe middle-aged man named Duke Tartan smiled, pointing towards the huge rampart that could be seen further ahead.\u201cAlthough, they have been broken through before.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSince the prince knew about that occasion, he nodded calmly.\u201cSince they are waiting for us, let\u2019s enter first.\u201dDuke Tartan pointed towards the people waiting under Zieghart\u2019s rampart.In front of an enormous iron door, which was big enough to fit a giant, swordsmen wearing red coats were looking towards them with sharp gazes.\u201cOkay.\u201dThe prince nodded shortly and headed towards the iron gate, where the Zieghart\u2019s gatekeepers were standing.***Raon, who was about to return to the training ground after lunch, stopped.\u2018What is that?\u2019From the direction of the front gate, he could feel the presence of many people. The sound of armor bumping into each other was a metallic sound that couldn\u2019t usually be heard in Zieghart.Soon enough, the foreign minister Illiune appeared, and the knights clad in silver armor followed him.\u2018The Owen kingdom\u2026\u2019There was a lion\u2019s head drawn on the left side of their silver armor. It was the Owen Kingdom\u2019s emblem.The other trainees and swordsmen also stopped walking, watching the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knights passing by.\u201cThey are the envoys of the Owen Kingdom.\u201dDorian stood next to him and gently whistled.\u201cEnvoys?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve been cleaning everywhere in the household because of the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys. Did you not know?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. But their numbers are pretty small for an envoy.\u201dRaon furrowed his brows, looking at the small children walking behind the knights.\u201cAh, they are the knight trainees that came along with the third prince of the Owen Kingdom. They must be here to get some experience.\u201d\u201cYou are knowledgeable.\u201d\u201cBecause there were rumors about it. Look, everyone looks like they knew about it already.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dIt looked like he was the only one who didn\u2019t know about it, and maybe Runaan, who was usually just blank.Raon looked through the kingdom\u2019s envoys.\u2018They are pretty strong.\u2019The knight trainees were as strong as the trainees in the fifth training ground, as if they were proving they were from the Six Kings just like the Ziegharts.\u2018Well, whether they are strong or not doesn\u2019t really matter to me\u2026 huh?\u2019When he was turning around to head towards the training ground, he met the eyes of the knight trainee that was standing at the frontmost.His sky like blue eyes contained an unshakable spirit.\u2018He is pretty strong for his age.\u2019He understood it just by looking at him. That knight trainee was the strongest of them.\u2018However.\u2019That assessment was considering his age, and he still had a long way to go to be considered good for Raon.As expected, the blue-eyed child couldn\u2019t read Raon\u2019s strength, turning around after looking at him for a moment.\u2018I have no time to pay attention to something like that.\u2019He was busy completing his footwork and swordsmanship. Since he wasn\u2019t going to meet the kingdom\u2019s envoys, watching them for a moment was plenty.Raon walked towards the training ground, only thinking about the footwork\u2019s flows.***\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019For the first time in his life, the third prince of the Owen Kingdom, Greer De Owen felt a chill go down his spine.He slowly raised his head. The more his gaze raised, the more difficult it became for him to breathe.Everything was because of the man who that sitting at the top.The Destructive King of the North, Glenn Zieghart. The man called the strongest swordsman of the continent zapped all his strength from his limbs just from being seen.\u201cThank you for your effort on your trip.\u201d\u201cThank you for your warm welcome.\u201dHe barely managed to come to his senses thanks to Duke Tartan\u2019s voice from next to him.\u201cHe looks exactly like the previous king in his youth. I can understand why he cherishes you so much.\u201dGlenn Zieghart slowly nodded, watching his face.\u201cTh-thank you.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t talk properly because his mouth was completely dry. His presence was too overbearing, despite not using any pressure. It was a completely different experience from when he met the Kingdom\u2019s best sword.\u201cI-I have a letter from his majesty the king.\u201dThe third prince took out a golden envelope. He forced his trembling legs to stand up.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dWhile shivering, he approached the platform and handed over the letter.\u201cHmm.\u201dUpon seeing that, Glenn\u2019s eyes shone for a second, but quickly disappeared.\u201cAs you\u2019ve requested, I\u2019ve arranged things so that you can observe the trainees.\u201dPutting the letter aside, Glenn slowly spoke.\u201cI\u2019ve prepared an evening banquet, so do rest for today and visit them tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d\u201cThen see you again later.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe third prince took three steps backward and bowed, then stood up.\u201cAnd the duke\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something to tell the head of house about. Please go ahead and rest.\u201dDuke Tartan closed his eyes while smiling lightly.\u201cI see.\u201dThe third prince nodded shortly, then left the audience chamber.\u201cHe is a very talented child. He will rise to the throne of the sword, before the throne of the king.\u201dGlenn opened his mouth first, after a short silence.\u201cI knew you would realize it at a glance. The third prince is called the Kingdom\u2019s best sword in waiting.\u201d\u201cCertainly, it is a rare talent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just about talent, he also has a strong willpower. He also visited the south to witness Robert\u2019s swordsmanship.\u201dDuke Tartan smiled happily, looking at the door through which the third prince had left.\u201cHmph.\u201dGlenn slightly lifted the corners of his mouth.\u2018Talent, effort and willpower, huh\u2026\u2019Just by looking at the third prince\u2019s eyes, he could tell what kind of talent he had and what kind of efforts he\u2019d been making.He must have experienced various things and worked hard from a young age. However, Glenn knew somebody even better than him.Raon Zieghart.Since he knew about Raon\u2019s effort and willpower, he wasn\u2019t convinced with the third prince\u2019s greatness.\u201cSince you didn\u2019t come here to show off the prince, let\u2019s get to the point.\u201dThe letter in Glenn\u2019s hand burned up.\u201cYou burned it without even taking a look.\u201dAlthough the letter was burned up, Duke Tartan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.\u201cThere\u2019s no way he would\u2019ve entrusted an important letter to a child.\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dDuke Tartan knelt and respectfully lowered his head, unlike when he was boasting about the third prince.\u201cI will convey the words of the king of Owen Kingdom, Lacrosse Albert de Owen the second.\u201dWhen he raised his head, his eyes were completely serious.\u201cThe five darknesses have started to move.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Pow!Raon\u2019s right hand advanced as smoothly as a salmon swimming upstream.His left foot followed. His lower body moved as fluently as a deer running through the forest.It wasn\u2019t fast but smooth, not powerful but abrupt.The twelve forms of the River Footwork that he was using looked as cheerful and free as a leaf riding the wind.Thud!With a step shaking the ground, he finished training the River Footwork.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dExhaling an excited breath, he raised his head, straightening his back.\u2018They are still watching.\u2019When he looked around, the trainees, who were watching him train, turned in surprise.Ever since the first day they\u2019d learned the River Footwork, they\u2019d been training while watching him instead of the instructors.Burren, Runaan, and Martha weren\u2019t exceptions, either.\u201cUm!\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dBurren and Martha snorted upon meeting his eyes and turned around.\u201cMhm.\u201dOf course, Runaan didn\u2019t avoid his gaze. Instead, she came closer to him and performed her footwork. That meant she wanted him to teach her.\u201cOh, well.\u201dRaon shook his head and pointed out what Runaan was lacking in her footwork.\u201cYoung master, can you teach me too?\u201dDorian approached him while scratching his belly pocket, showing him his footwork.\u201cTo begin with, your posture is too high. Get a bit lower\u2026\u201dWhen he was pointing out his problems, the door to the training ground opened and Rimmer entered.\u2018Why is he here?\u2019Raon frowned, watching Rimmer trotting in. It was the first time he came to visit during break time.\u201cDoes everyone know about the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoy visiting us today?\u201d\u201cYes, we do.\u201dBurren stepped up and responded. His round eyes looked surprised that Rimmer was visiting during break time.\u201cThey are going to hold a banquet for the envoys this evening. Since they have knight trainees, those of you who are the same age as them are also allowed to participate.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cBanquet?\u201dThe trainees' expressions brightened at the thought of meeting the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knights and becoming acquainted with the knight trainees.\u201cHowever!\u201dRimmer shook his head.\u201cYou haven\u2019t even properly acquired the River Footwork yet. If it were me, I\u2019d be too ashamed to participate, for sure!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cTh-that is\u2026\u201dThe trainees bit their lips to the unexpected words.\u201cAh? Were you planning to participate? But you still have lots of training left to do, right? You haven\u2019t completed the swordsmanship nor the footwork, though?\u201dHe sticked out his face and teased them as he looked through the trainees.\u201cDa-damn it!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe trainees lowered their heads, speechless.\u201cThere\u2019s only one person who is qualified to participate.\u201dRimmer\u2019s gaze was directed at Raon.\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dRaon shook his head and picked up his training sword. His River Footwork was almost perfect, but he still had a long way to go until he could combine it with his swordsmanship.It wasn\u2019t time for him to make personal connections through a banquet. It was time to do his best in training.\u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude.\u201dRimmer smiled. He had a satisfied expression, as if saying that he knew it.\u201cWell, if you really want to go, I\u2019ll allow it. Does anyone want to?\u201dPutting his hand on Raon\u2019s shoulder, he looked through the trainees.He seemed to be asking whether they wanted to go when Raon, the strongest one among them, wanted to keep training.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201c\u2026Nope.\u201dMartha and Burren turned around and stepped away to train.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRunaan hadn\u2019t been listening to Rimmer from the beginning and had been practicing footwork.\u201cWell, keep training then. There will be plenty of banquets to participate in once you get stronger! I\u2019m gonna leave then.\u201dRimmer shook his hand as if he were making fun of them and left the training ground.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon scratched his chin while watching him leave. Considering Rimmer\u2019s personality, he would\u2019ve allowed them to participate in a banquet. It was a bit strange that he had stopped them, instead.\u2018What is he thinking about now?\u2019***The splendid lights were shining upon the main building\u2019s banquet hall, instead of the heavy snows.The third prince of the Owen Kingdom, Greer De Owen, sat at his designated seat while licking his lips.\u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019His head was spinning from greeting people from Zieghart for hours. He just wanted to practice his sword, since something like a banquet made him uncomfortable.The king\u2019s order wasn\u2019t the only reason that he was participating in something he didn\u2019t enjoy.Zieghart\u2019s sword.And the swordsmen who practiced that sword. It was in order to observe them.\u201cHaa.\u201dThe third prince gulped down the drink on the table and frowned.\u2018They are certainly amazing warriors.\u2019The pressures of Zieghart\u2019s warriors were proud and powerful. Their might didn\u2019t lose to the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knights, which filled him with excitement.\u2018However.\u2019The might of Zieghart\u2019s young swordsmen was completely disappointing.If it was another house or kingdom, they would\u2019ve been called extremely talented people, but they were a bit lacking to be called the Six King\u2019s trainees.\u2018They are even worse than Robert's.\u2019The head of the southern house Robert, which he\u2019d visited before coming to Zieghart, seemed to have better young swordsmen than them.\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to look around tomorrow.\u201dGlenn had allowed him to observe the training, but he didn\u2019t have any reason to visit, considering their levels.\u201cYou look disappointed.\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dHe hurriedly turned around, hearing a light voice coming from behind.\u201cEl-elf?\u201dA red-haired and dark green-eyed elf was smiling, his hands behind his back.\u201cDo you want to see the real deal?\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41\u201cWhat do you mean by the real deal?\u201dThe third prince swallowed and took a step back. Because he was unaware of the identity and intention of the elf that had suddenly appeared, he started by keeping a distance.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so afraid.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201dHe frowned, looking up to the red-haired elf.\u201cAnswer my question first. What is the real deal?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dWhen the elf was about to answer, Duke Tartan burst from the ground. It almost looked like he came out from the shadow created by the hall\u2019s lighting.\u201cZieghart\u2019s Sword of Light, why are you here?\u201d\u201cEek!\u201dGreer\u2019s eyes widened upon hearing the title mentioned by Duke Tartan.\u2018Zieghart\u2019s Sword of Light!\u2019He finally realized who the elf was. He was one of the Glenn Zieghart\u2019s devoted retainers, whose sword is rumored to be as fast as the light.\u2018But why did he come to me\u2026?\u2019He\u2019d heard about his retirement after an injury, but he didn\u2019t understand why he came looking for him.\u201cAh, there\u2019s no need to be so tense.\u201dRimmer shook his hand, expressing that he had no intention to fight.\u201cI\u2019ve seen you acting like a madman over and over again. Of course, I can\u2019t relax around you.\u201d\u201cAs you see, I\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dWithout withdrawing his pressure, Duke Tartan took a glance behind him.\u201cYour highness, what did this crazy elf talk about?\u201d\u201cHe asked whether I wanted to meet the real deal.\u201d\u201cThe real deal? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cHmm, it\u2019d be a bit awkward to say it here now.\u201dExtending his arm, Rimmer pointed to the surroundings. The banquet had become silent, and everyone was watching them.\u201cWell, I\u2019m actually uninvited.\u201dLaughing off the gazes pouring down from everywhere, he turned around.\u201cThe prince of Owen.\u201dRimmer stopped, then turned around while he was walking towards the exit.\u201cIf you want to see the real deal, tell them you want to visit the fifth training ground when you are observing the training tomorrow.\u201dAfter saying that, he left the banquet hall.Once Rimmer\u2014who even said that he came uninvited\u2014had left, the music started playing once again.However, Rimmer's last words were the only thing that resounded inside Greer\u2019s head.\u2018The real deal exists in the fifth training ground, huh?\u2019***\u201cHuhuhu!\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dRaon frowned, hearing Rimmer\u2019s humming.\u2018Why is he doing that?\u2019Rimmer, who should have been lying down napping after telling the other instructors to teach, was personally giving directions with his eyes clearly open. It was making Raon feel anxious for some reason.\u201cWhat is wrong with that man?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u201cMaybe it was something he ate?\u201d\u201cHe probably won some money at the gambling house yesterday.\u201dBurren and the other trainees also kept glancing at Rimmer while swinging their swords.\u201cHead instructor, did something good happen?\u201dDorian, who was curious despite being a coward, approached Rimmer.\u201cThere will be guests.\u201d\u2018Guests?\u2019It was even more confusing now, because Rimmer hated annoying things. And yet, he was looking forward to the guests.\u2018I should just keep training.\u2019The elf was just so strange that it was impossible to guess his actions or thoughts. It was better to just focus on training.Raon drew on the burning aura from his energy center and extended his right foot.Stomp!Starting with a groundbreaking sound of a stride, he performed the River Footwork and Combination Sword at once.Between the footwork that flowed as naturally as water, a sharp, light sword burst up.Slash!Despite being a mixture between defensive footwork and offensive swordsmanship, it didn\u2019t feel unnatural at all. That was because both techniques focused on flow and combination.The flow was natural, as if he was using a single martial art to begin with.Feeling the other trainees\u2019 gazes, which he had gotten used to, he performed the swordsmanship and the footwork until the end.\u201cHuff.\u201dRaon let his sword down, exhaling as he finished performing the swordsmanship and footwork at once.\u2018It\u2019s still not enough.\u2019There were a few improper parts because he\u2019d combined the use of his swordsmanship, footwork, and aura.He needed more practice before it became usable in a real battle.\u201cAgain.\u201dAs he was about to practice once again, he felt multiple presences from the training ground main entrance.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201dThe instructors reacted after Raon, then the trainees also stopped swinging their swords.When everyone\u2019s gaze was directed at the entrance, a knocking sound could be heard.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhile smiling, Rimmer gestured to an instructor. The instructor, who was standing at the center, started to open the door to the training ground.\u201cI\u2019m Gesman from the general administration.\u201dA neat young man wearing a uniform stuck his head out, and the knights wearing silver armor were waiting behind him.\u201cThe people from the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoy wanted to observe the fifth training ground\u2019s training. It might be sudden, but is it possible to attend?\u201d\u201cPlease enter, guests are always welcome.\u201dRimmer came to the door in the blink of an eye and opened it wide.\u201cTh-thank you. Please enter.\u201dGesman bowed. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he guided the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoy inside the training ground.\u201cHuh.\u201dRaon smirked, sheathing his training sword at his waist.\u2018Guests are welcome?\u2019Rimmer refused to show the information on their training, even to the swordsmen of the same household. Him saying that the guests were welcome was the biggest bullshit ever.When he looked around, other trainees were also rolling their eyes in surprise.\u201cThe Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys used their precious time to visit us. Show them what kind of martial art the Zieghart\u2019s trainees have learned.\u201dRimmer, who used to be at the door, suddenly appeared on the platform. He wasn\u2019t even moving like the wind at that point, and he was like a ghost instead.\u201cWhat does he want, all of the sudden?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, we should just act like always.\u201dReceiving the gazes of the Owen Kingdom's envoys, the trainees started creaking like a broken doll.\u201cGet a grip! You should calm down even more at a time like this and do your best!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Burren was no different than usual. Or rather, he was moving even better, and led the trainees.\u2018It worked.\u2019As expected of someone who gave himself to Zieghart, he knew what he was supposed to show.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a clown.\u201dMartha snorted and crossed her arms. Emitting a pressure as fierce as facing an enemy, she glared at the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys. She looked ready to fight them if they wanted.\u2018She hasn\u2019t changed.\u2019Martha had only become softer to him, and she was still as fierce and bad-mouthed as ever.Runaan wasn\u2019t interested in them at all. She kept swinging her sword using her footwork, without a single moment\u2019s interruption.\u2018I think she might be the strongest.\u2019Not losing focus in that kind of messy situation was a peerless talent.Raon skimmed through the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys one after another. The blue-eyed knight trainee was carefully watching Burren, Martha and Runaan, one after another.He seemed rather surprised, with his mouth slightly open.\u2018And he still didn\u2019t recognize me.\u2019Despite noticing those three, he seemed unaware of Raon\u2019s might.\u2018Well.\u2019Raon smiled slightly and pulled out his training sword, his legs at shoulder\u2019s width.\u2018Shall I start as well?\u2019The River Footwork and Combination sword were both extremely simple in their forms and postures.It was a testament to their strength that they wouldn\u2019t get weaker once seen, so there was no problem with having observers.Swoosh!Without minding the gazes, Raon naturally blended in the flow of the sword and footwork.***The third prince Greer De Owen had visited two places before coming to the fifth training ground.The first was the second training ground, where those who\u2019d already received the title of swordsman were practicing.\u2018It was amazing.\u2019The swordsmen from the second training ground were powerful, befitting the great name of Zieghart.They weren\u2019t inferior in any way compared to the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knights in swordsmanship, pressure, body, and mind.\u2018However, the sixth training ground where the trainees practiced was rather disappointing.\u2019The trainees at the six training grounds were talented, but they lacked practice.He\u2019d originally planned to request a spar, but he gave up since the result was too obvious.\u2018That\u2019s when I remembered.\u2019When he was going to head back, he remembered what Rimmer had mentioned. That question about whether he wanted to see the real deal.That was why he told the officer from the general administration, who was about to guide them elsewhere, that he wanted to see the fifth training ground.He seemed flustered, but he guided them to the fifth training ground without refusing the request.He actually didn\u2019t have high expectations.He thought the fifth training ground wouldn\u2019t be much different from the sixth training ground.However, that was a huge mistake.He understood the moment he entered the training ground that it was different.The talent and the amount of training they did was on a whole different dimension from the sixth training ground.\u2018The real deal was this place.\u2019Rimmer was correct. The trainees from the fifth training ground weren\u2019t any weaker than the knight trainees.The blue-haired boy and the silver-haired girl especially were one level stronger than the others.And the black-haired beauty who was glaring at them also possessed an overwhelming pressure.All three of them were as strong as himself, or Setun, who was called the strongest knight trainee.\u201cThis was the real one indeed.\u201dDuke Tartan furrowed his brows while watching the trainees.\u201cIt looks like it.\u201d\u201cAlthough it looks like there\u2019s not a big difference in talent except for a few. The difference is mostly with how much they\u2019ve trained.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGreer nodded. The fifth training ground had a completely different atmosphere. He could smell the passion filled with the trainees\u2019 blood and sweat.\u201cThose three are particularly amazing.\u201dThe knight trainee Setun\u2019s eyes shone with the intention to fight. He was also watching the three powerhouses he\u2019d recognized.\u201cI want to try fighting them.\u201d\u201cSame goes for me.\u201dThe third prince and Setun licked their lips, watching the three people they thought were the strongest in the fifth training ground.\u201cHow is it? Just like I\u2019ve said, the real ones are here, right?\u201dA voice as cool as the wind could be heard from behind.\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen they turned around, Rimmer was standing there with the same smile as the day before.\u201cCertainly, I understand why you said that before.\u201dGreer nodded.\u201cYou seem to be itching for a fight. How about sparring with one of our boys?\u201d\u201cWas that the goal?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to fight against one of the Six King\u2019s talents in complete safety. It will also help you.\u201dRimmer pointed towards the trainees who were focused on their swords.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGreer turned around to look at Duke Tartan. Since he was the actual leader, he needed his permission.\u201cThat sounds fine.\u201dDuke Tartan nodded but gave Rimmer a cold gaze. His face seemed to say that he would cut him down the moment he tried something funny.\u201cI just want some sparring. However.\u201dRimmer raised both his hands and smiled.\u201cAre you fine with a small bet?\u201d\u201cBet?\u201d\u201cYes. After twenty duels, the loser rewards the winner.\u201d\u201cHah, do you think you can win against us?\u201d\u201cOh, you are pretty confident, huh?\u201d\u201cOf course. Because they are the elites among the Owen\u2019s knight trainees!\u201dDuke Tartan was full of confidence as he looked at the knight trainees.\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dRimmer smiled. His eyes were clearly shining in dark green.\u201cSince I also trust my boys.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42\u201cAttention, everyone!\u201dRimmer went up to the platform and clapped his hands. The trainees that were focused on training lifted their heads.\u201cYou can see them, right?\u201dHe pointed towards the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knights, who were standing on the right side of the training ground.\u201cThe guests from the Owen Kingdom have requested a spar!\u201d\u201cA-a spar?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so sudden!\u201dThe trainees dropped their jaws at the unexpected mention of a spar.\u201cSudden? What do you mean, sudden? I\u2019ve always told you that a swordsman should be ready to swing a sword whenever, even when you\u2019ve just woken up.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue and murmured that they still had a long way to go.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cBut they are from the Owen Kingdom\u2026\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be b-better to prepare before fighting?\u201dThe trainees still seemed tense, despite Rimmer\u2019s advice.However, some trainees were thinking completely differently.Burren and Martha looked through the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knight trainees one-by-one, like beasts looking for their prey.Runaan just kept training without paying attention to the people talking.\u201cHehe!\u201dAfter enjoying the trainees\u2019 flustered reactions, Rimmer looked at Raon. His eyes seemed to be asking his opinion.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon turned his head to examine the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knight trainees.\u2018A spar, huh\u2026\u2019There could be some among the knights, but nobody among the knight trainees were on the same level as him.But the prince at the center wasn\u2019t a bad opponent to practice the synergy between the River Footwork and Combination Sword.Raon nodded slowly, and Rimmer\u2019s smile became wider.\u201cSince everyone has agreed, we can start now. Twenty people will participate, and\u2026\u201dRimmer lowered his voice, so that his trainees were the only ones who could hear him.\u201cI\u2019ve bet my whole month\u2019s salary, so make sure you win. I\u2019ll really kill you if you lose.\u201d\u201cHaaah?\u201d\u201cPardon? Wh-what does that\u2026?\u201d\u201cPrepare for a match!\u201dThe trainees\u2019 jaws dropped. They wanted to complain, but Rimmer turned around before they could and started to give orders to the instructors.\u201cYes!\u201dAs if they knew about it already, the instructors moved the trainees away and started setting up the arena for the spar.\u201cHah.\u201dRaon smirked at seeing that.\u2018So, this was it.\u2019The reason that Rimmer had been acting differently for the last few days was because of this spar.He must have been preparing for a spar the moment he\u2019d heard about the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys arrival.\u2018That\u2019s pretty amazing.\u2019Although they were still children that weren\u2019t yet recognized as swordsmen or knights, sparring between the members of Six Kings didn\u2019t happen often.Rimmer, who was organizing the spar so naturally, was truly exceptional.\u201cGather.\u201dRaon turned around and called for everyone.\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan, who didn\u2019t care about anything so far, stopped swinging her sword and approached him first.\u201cTsk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBurren, Martha, and the other trainees also stood next to Runaan. Every trainee of the fifth training ground gathered in a circle around Raon.\u201cAs you\u2019ve heard, we will have to spar. Since we need to select twenty people, raise your hand if you want to participate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in, no matter what.\u201d\u201cSame. I\u2019ll fight even if I have to blow everyone away.\u201dBurren and Martha raised their hands first.\u201cIs Raon also fighting?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo am I, then.\u201dRunaan nodded and raised her hand. After that, around ten trainees raised their hands.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHowever, the other trainees were just looking at each other, unable to decide on participating.\u2018Are they scared?\u2019The Owen Kingdom\u2019s knight trainees were wearing armor, despite not having received an official title yet.While they were still not completely confident in their skills, it looked like their bodies and minds were frozen due to the intense pressure coming from the confident knight trainees.\u201cTsk.\u201dIt was annoying, but since he was the top trainee, it was his job to encourage the trainees.\u201cDo they look confident to you?\u201dRaon pointed towards the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knight trainees who were preparing for the spar.\u201cWell, a little bit.\u201d\u201cThey look dangerous too.\u201dThe trainees nodded timidly.\u201cWatch their hands more carefully.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dFollowing Raon\u2019s finger, the trainees\u2019 gazes were directed at the knight trainees\u2019 hands.\u201cHmm?\u2019\u201cI-it looks like they\u2019re shaking a little?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just look like it. They are actually shaking\u2026\u201d\u201cThe others are the same.\u201dThe trainees' eyes widened upon watching the other knight trainees\u2019 hands.\u201cThey are indeed wearing fancy armor, but they are just trainees that can\u2019t hide their shaking and nervousness before a spar.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cWhich means that they are children your age, with similar thoughts.\u201dRaon turned around to look at the trainees.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid. The training you\u2019ve been doing isn't any less than the other Six Kings or Five Demons. You won\u2019t lose disgracefully as long as you use what you\u2019ve learned so far.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201d\u201cO-of course, nobody has trained as hard as us.\u201d\u201cThe amount of blood and sweat we\u2019ve spilled from training doesn\u2019t lose to anyone.\u201dRaon\u2019s serious recognition made the trainees\u2019 eyes burn with liveliness and passion.\u201cI\u2019m asking this again. Raise your hand if you want to participate in the spar.\u201dAlong with the sound of a sudden wind, every single trainee raised their hand.Raon nodded, and selected twenty trainees among them, including Burren, Runaan and Martha.Whether they were selected or not, all the trainees saw the Owen Kingdom from a different angle.\u2018It\u2019s annoying.\u2019Taking care of children was more annoying than he\u2019d thought.However, since he\u2019d been sharing his time and space with the other trainees, he thought he\u2019d gotten attached to them a little. He didn\u2019t completely hate it.\u201cThen I\u2019ll decide the order. The first is Martha, can you do it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll beat them up.\u201dMartha nodded. Since the first would affect the morale of the trainees, Martha\u2014who was the second strongest person in the fifth training ground\u2014was the best suited.\u201cAnd next\u2026\u201dHe decided the orders one by one. Runaan was 18th, Burren was 19th, and he was the last.\u201cIf you are done preparing, please gather at the center.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dRaon walked towards the center of the training ground, hearing Rimmer\u2019s cheeky voice.***Martha raised her chin at the sight of the knight trainee that was facing her in the arena. The nice, clean silver armor and his big build made him look like an official knight.However, she wasn\u2019t afraid. He didn\u2019t look big at all compared to that bastard who\u2019d beaten her with sheer power.\u201cI\u2019m Tarse.\u201dThe big knight trainee lowered his head while putting his hand on his sword sheath.\u201cMartha Zieghart.\u201dMartha announced her name and stood with her feet at half shoulder-width.\u201cThat immature body is trained tremendously. I\u2019m looking forward to a good match.\u201dThe knight trainee, who called himself Tarse, identified her nature without being distracted by her refined appearance and small size. It looked like he wasn\u2019t chosen as the spearhead for nothing.\u201cA good match? You\u2019ll end up beaten up anyway, so stop goofing around and fight.\u201dMartha snorted and moved her finger.\u201cHmph.\u201dTarse snorted and unsheathed his sword. It was greatsword, thicker than a common knight\u2019s sword.\u201cYou are more foul-mouthed than you look. I hope your swordsmanship can match up to your words.\u201d\u201cYou talk too much. I\u2019ll attack first if you won\u2019t.\u201dMartha kicked off from the ground and unsheathed her sword at the same time. The white blade slashed through the heated atmosphere.\u201cIdiot!\u201dTarse slammed down his greatsword with a cold gaze. A powerful wind pressure emanated from the dull blade of the greatsword.Whoosh!As the heavy wind was about to press down on Martha\u2019s body, her eyes shone.Stomp!Striding across the ground, she struck up with her sword. Like a salmon swimming up a waterfall, she slashed through the wind pressure and clashed with the greatsword.Bang!With the sound of exploding metal, Tarse\u2019s greatsword flew away and got stuck on the ground.\u201cEek!\u201dTarse moved back in surprise, but Martha didn\u2019t miss that opportunity. She immediately followed up and hit his abdomen with the side of the sword.\u201cKueh!\u201dAfter being hit in his stomach, Tarse was knocked back and foaming at the mouth.\u201cDespite relying on your strength, you didn\u2019t put everything in one strike. Pathetic.\u201dMartha smiled coldly and turned away after sheathing her sword.\u201cMartha wins!\u201dRimmer smiled in satisfaction and raised his hand on Martha\u2019s side.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon tapped his finger while watching Martha\u2019s back.\u2018She changed, but also didn\u2019t.\u2019He\u2019d thought Martha\u2019s swordsmanship would become softer after losing to him, but he was wrong.Instead of adding softness, she had increased the power and speed even further to make it more powerful. She was ridiculously simple minded.\u2018An unbreakable will, huh?\u2019Her personality, which didn\u2019t compromise, would bring her to a higher level.\u2018It will be pretty fun.\u2019Fun? Is it fun watching a fight between young ants? It only looked boring to the King of Essence.\u2018Even ants don\u2019t stay young forever.\u2019Pathetic. Back in devildom, the King of Essence gathered young devils and made them spar. Even then, they weren\u2019t as bad as this\u2026 Kuh!Raon touched the flower bracelet to shut Wrath up and waited for the next spar.\u2018It\u2019s fun for me, so please shut up.\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Martha showed the best opening, but the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knight trainees weren\u2019t easy opponents.It looked like only the best had come, since they alternated between victory and defeat in matches against the fifth training ground\u2019s trainees.As such, the fifth training ground\u2019s trainees ended up with eight victories and nine defeats after 17 matches. The 18th was Runaan\u2019s turn.\u201cRunaan, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded and went into the arena.A female knight around the same size as Runaan was standing there with her hand on her back.\u201cEdelia.\u201d\u201cRunaan Sullion.\u201dRunaan and Edelia faced each other in accordance with the etiquette of a knight and a swordsman.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout even taking out her sword, Runaan blankly stared at Edelia.\u201cI don\u2019t like those blank eyes of yours.\u201dEdelia frowned and dashed towards Runaan. A red flame burned at the end of her sword, pointed like a spear.Whoosh!Aura of flame. Her move was displaying the reason that she came out on the latter part, despite her small body.\u201cI don\u2019t like fire.\u201dRunaan pouted unnoticeably and unsheathed her sword.Whap!Frost even whiter than the silver blade covered the space.Bzzt!The moment the sword of flame and sword of ice clashed, white steam burst up.Using the River Footwork, Runaan hid her body between the frigid air and the steam.\u201cI can simply erase the cold air!\u201dEdelia swung the flame on her sword like a torch to get rid of the frigid air and the steam at the same time.\u201cThere!\u201dWithout overlooking the wobbliness in the frigid air, she thrust her sword.\u201cHuh?\u201dEdelia\u2019s eyes widened. The tip of her sword hadn\u2019t touched anything, and she had only pierced the empty air.\u201cUgh!\u201dAt the chilly feeling she felt around her neck, she swallowed and turned her head.Shush.Along with her cold gaze, Runaan\u2019s sword was pointed at Edelia\u2019s neck.\u201c\u2026I lost.\u201dEdelia bit her lip and dropped her sword.Runaan removed her sword from her neck and sheathed it.\u201cIt was a good fight\u2026 Huh?\u201dEdelia extended her hand, but Runaan returned without even looking back and stood in front of Raon.\u201cDid you see?\u201d\u201cYou got used to your footwork. Good job.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded and sat next to Raon.Raon smiled lightly, feeling Runaan\u2019s cold pressure.\u2018She really used my footwork in real combat.\u2019The footwork that Runaan had just used was the stealth version of the River Footwork that she\u2019d practiced when she was alone.He only had given her a few pieces of advice, yet Runaan managed to create an application from the footwork.He felt a sense of satisfaction after seeing how she followed his advice so well, despite him not teaching her properly.\u201cNine wins and Nine defeats from both sides, this is getting interesting. The 19th match will begin.\u201dRimmer looked overjoyed as he kept smiling, calling for Burren and the knight trainee.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon licked his lips.\u2018He is pretty strong.\u2019The knight trainee that stood in front of Burren had a stable posture, his eyes emitting a clear light. Except for the third prince, he was the strongest among the knight trainees that he\u2019d seen so far.The two of them were similar in terms of might, to the point where one mistake could decide the outcome. It looked like the knight trainee they\u2019d sent out this time could be called a secret weapon.\u201cI\u2019m the knight trainee Setun Kazel.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the trainee Burren Zieghart.\u201dThe knight trainee and Burren bowed to each other respectfully and put their hands on their sword sheaths.\u201cThe 19th match, begin!\u201dAs soon as Rimmer finished talking, two of them disappeared from the arena at once.Thud!Burren, who\u2019d kicked off the ground using footwork, clashed his sword with Setun\u2019s at the center.\u2018They know.\u2019The two of them were also aware. Since their might was equal, the fight would be over the moment they were careless.Pow!Pow!Burren\u2019s sword was fast and precise, while Setun\u2019s sword was heavy and powerful.The two swordsmen slammed down their swords, all while maximizing their best traits to suppress their opponents.It was such a close match that not only the trainees, but also the swordsmen fully focused on the match.Psh!Blood spurted from Burren\u2019s shoulder, and Setun\u2019s armor was split apart.The swordsman and knight didn\u2019t drop their swords despite the blood flowing or their flesh being torn apart.As if they were facing the opponent of their life, they thrust their swords towards the other\u2019s weak point.Tap tap tap!Burren, who was pushed back by Setun\u2019s heavy strikes, grit his teeth. Holding his sword, he brought up as much aura as he could.\u201cHmph!\u201dHaving felt Burren\u2019s energy, Setun also started controlling all the aura in his energy center.\u201cHaap!\u201dBurren advanced, carried by the wind, and Setun slammed down his sword with his feet firmly rooted on the ground.Bam!With a collapsing sound in the arena, gray smoke burst up.With the sound of small rocks being split apart being heard, the two stopped moving.Whoosh!When Rimmer extended his hand while humming, a green wind pushed away the smoke from the arena.Burren and Setun were stopped at a distance where they could reach each other with a punch, and both their swords were broken in half, stuck in the ground.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cTh-that means\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a draw.\u201dJust as the trainees said, neither of them could keep fighting. Having exhausted their stamina and aura, their limbs were visibly trembling.\u201cThe 19th match is a draw!\u201dHearing Rimmer\u2019s declaration, Burren forced himself to stand and left the arena.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dHe frowned, gritting his teeth.\u201cGood job. That knight trainee was the strongest on Owen's side.\u201d\u201cSo what? I should\u2019ve won no matter what, fighting under the name of Zieghart!\u201dBurren slammed the ground with his clenched fist. Since he\u2019d run out of strength, his skin was torn apart.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon looked at Setun, who fought against Burren. The way his calm expression had grown wrinkled, it looked like he was also frustrated.\u2018Honor, huh\u2026?\u2019Since living kept his hands full, both in his previous and current life, he still didn\u2019t really understand what honor meant.\u201cThen let\u2019s start the last match, which will decide the outcome!\u201dHe stood up, hearing Rimmer\u2019s cheerful voice.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dRaon looked back at Burren, who was twisting his lips.\u201cBecause I\u2019ll win.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBurren didn\u2019t respond. His expression seemed to mean that he trusted him in his own way.Raon turned his body and entered the arena. He didn\u2019t understand honor, but since everyone was working together, he would win it for them. No, he wanted to win.\u201cAre you a member of the direct line of Zieghart?\u201dThe third prince, who\u2019d been waiting in the arena, turned his head while tapping on his sword.\u201cNo, I'm collateral.\u201d\u201cTsk, I end up fighting a sacrificial pawn.\u201dThe third prince\u2019s forehead wrinkled at hearing that Raon was a collateral. It looked like he\u2019d still not recognized his might.\u201cI have a suggestion.\u201dThe third prince turned towards Rimmer without even looking at Raon.\u201cWhat kind of suggestion?\u201d\u201cThose two.\u201dHe pointed at Runaan and Martha, who were looking at the arena.\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to have used all their strength, so how about I try fighting them again if I win against this guy?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer scratched his shivering chin. His expression certainly looked like he was trying to stop himself from exploding in laughter.\u201cWell, let\u2019s do that.\u00a0If. You. Win.\u201d\u201cWell then, tell them to warm themselves up. Since it will be over soon.\u201dThe third prince smiled in satisfaction and turned around.\u201cIndeed, it will be over soon.\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes shone with coldness.Because I will win.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Rimmer smirked, watching Raon and the third prince face each other in the arena. He was looking forward to it so much that he unconsciously started humming.\u2018And the rewards.\u2019He was also looking forward to the reward that he was going to earn from the bet with Owen.He wasn\u2019t even considering the possibility of Raon losing the match.\u201cYou look like you are enjoying yourself.\u201dDuke Tartan came to stand next to him without showing his emotions.\u201cOf course I am. Watching young talents clashing against each other with everything they have can\u2019t be anything but fun.\u201d\u201cThe crazy sword demon has changed a lot.\u201d\u201cA ruffian like you became a good-looking duke. Of course I\u2019ve changed as well.\u201dRimmer smirked at Duke Tartan.\u201cI\u2019m assuming the reason you approached the prince yesterday was also because of this match, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan? Why are you doing something so troublesome, which you normally don\u2019t like?\u201dDuke Tartan turned towards him and emanated a powerful pressure. He looked like he was about to cut him down the moment he tried anything strange.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for them to grow. Unlike the Five Demons, there won\u2019t be many chances to fight against one of the Six Kings\u2019 children.\u201dRimmer responded without looking back at him. It was a light voice, but it was also completely serious at the same time.\u201c\u2026Seriously?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI thought you were joking, but you\u2019ve really changed.\u201dTartan licked his lips and turned his head back to the arena.\u201cThe knight trainees that participated in spars today are all children supported by Owen. Those children are pretty strong, to be at the same level as them.\u201d\u201cObviously, who do you think taught them?\u201d\u201cHmph, stop boasting. By the way, that boy\u2026\u201dHe pointed at Raon, who was warming himself up by rolling his wrist and ankle.\u201cI mean, who is that monster? I almost failed to recognize him with his extremely thin presence. The way he uses his sword and footwork together isn\u2019t at a mere trainee\u2019s level.\u201d\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t blind.\u201dRimmer giggled and pointed at the third prince, who looked calm and composed at the opposite side.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you warn him about it? The third prince seems to be thinking that Raon is a sacrificial pawn.\u201d\u201cHis highness will become the Owen Kingdom\u2019s future, but he doesn\u2019t know defeat yet. I figured it\u2019s better for him to experience it in a safe place like this.\u201dThat was the reason that Tartan didn\u2019t warn the third prince about it, despite having identified Raon\u2019s might.He wanted to teach the third prince defeat so that he could reach a higher level.\u201cHowever, the third prince is strong. Even that genius swordsman won\u2019t be able to win with ease.\u201d\u201cI wonder\u2026\u201dRimmer shook his head, smiling more confidently than ever.\u201cI think a lot differently.\u201d\u201cYour stubbornness hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\u201cShall we make another bet, then?\u201d\u201cAgain?\u201dTartan frowned.\u201cYou really love bets, huh?\u201d\u201cThen how about just a drink?\u201d\u201cFine. But what kind of bet do you want\u2026\u201dRimmer raised five fingers.\u201cRaon will finish your hope in five strikes.\u201d\u201cNonsense! I realize that he is strong, but it\u2019s impossible in five strikes!\u201dTartan glared and clenched his fist.\u201cThen you want to take the bet, right?\u201d\u201cOf course! Bring it on.\u201d\u201cYou are as wild as always.\u201dRimmer giggled and rubbed his hands together.\u2018I\u2019m getting free drinks for the first time in a long time.\u2019***\u201cHmm.\u201dGreer De Owen, the third prince of the Owen Kingdom, licked his lips watching Runaan and Martha\u2014who were outside the arena\u2014instead of Raon, who was facing him.\u2018They will be good opponents.\u2019From the moment he entered the training ground, he\u2019d been only interested in those two and the blue-haired guy who fought equally against Setun.On the other hand, he didn\u2019t have a speck of interest in the collateral facing him. He looked fucking handsome, but that was it. He felt like his might was just too plain.\u2018I should finish this quickly.\u2019Using aura against the collateral in front of him would\u2019ve been a waste. He decided that he\u2019d do his best in his next match after single-handedly winning against him using only his physical strength.\u201cIf you are ready, let\u2019s begin the spar.\u201dRimmer approached them and raised his hand.\u201cLast spar, begin!\u201d\u201cHaa!\u201dThe moment his hand went down, Greer unsheathed his sword.Thud!Kicking off the ground, he dashed in front of Raon. He wanted to finish it in a single strike.However.\u2018Huh?\u2019Raon, who was standing in front of him, disappeared in an instant.\u2018Wh-where\u2026? Huff!\u2019As he was about to turn his head to find Raon, he could hear the dangerous sound of wind from the right.\u2018Sword!\u2019Greer felt the wind created by a sword and hurriedly ducked his head.Whoosh!Raon\u2019s training sword grazed his hair, giving him goosebumps.\u201cTsk!\u201dGreer rotated his body and swung his sword to the right.Whoosh!It was a precise strike, calculating Raon\u2019s position. However, Raon wasn\u2019t there this time, either.Sheesh.With the sound of a snake crawling the ground, he moved to his left. It all happened literally in a blink of an eye.\u2018What\u2019s that?!\u2019Greer grit his teeth. Using the Kingdom\u2019s Footwork, he quickly followed after Raon.\u201cHaa!\u201dHe struck down at Raon, who was stepping back. The sword plummeted down, containing a powerful energy.\u2018It\u2019s over!\u2019He was standing in the place that Raon would need to be in order to dodge the strike. There was no way he could avoid it.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe moment he thought it was over, he met Raon\u2019s eyes. The stationary eyes, without any sign of agitation in them, sent chills running down his spine the moment he saw them.Smack!Raon\u2019s body advanced, bending like a reed, and his sword rotated in a half moon shape.His world turned along with his sword.In the incomprehensible situation, he could just stay with his mouth wide open. He felt a powerful impact against his back.\u201cKuh!\u201dHe unconsciously groaned.\u201cWh-what is this\u2026?\u201dHe lifted his aching head. Raon was standing way above him.Greer finally realized he\u2019d fallen outside of the arena.\u201cKuh\u2026ah!\u201dThe third prince tried to raise his head while withstanding the pain in his back, then froze.\u2018I-it\u2019s him.\u2019The third prince swallowed, hands trembling.\u2018He was the real deal!\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cOh my.\u201dRimmer covered his mouth, as if he was stopping himself from laughing, and looked at Tartan.\u201cWhat happened? It wasn\u2019t even five strikes! It ended in two strikes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTartan didn\u2019t respond. Instead of the third prince on the ground, he was watching Raon with his jaw dropped.And he wasn\u2019t the only one. Everyone in the training ground was astonished as they watched Raon.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dIt took a long time for Tartan to finally exhale and straighten his back.\u201cWhat was that? How is his footwork so soft? The timing on his swordsmanship was also perfect. I didn\u2019t manage to identify everything.\u201dTartan\u2019s gaze was still fixated at Raon. The footwork and swordsmanship he\u2019d displayed was far beyond that of a trainee.What was even more surprising was that he\u2019d defeated the third prince with an appropriate movement according to the situation, instead of overwhelming might.It looked like the Raon boy had a special talent, showing more than his best.\u201cI told you Raon would win.\u201d\u201cI also knew that. But I didn\u2019t expect the third prince to lose without even standing a chance\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make the reservation at a bar. See you again this evening. You know I only drink expensive liquor, right?\u201d\u201cTsk!\u201d\u201cW-wait!\u201dWhen Tartan clicked his tongue and was about to turn his head around, the third prince stood up while wobbling.\u201cN-not yet. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201dHe entered the arena once again, unable to accept his defeat.\u201cY-your highness!\u201d\u201cOhh.\u201dTartan approached the third prince in panic, and Rimmer scratched his chin with an interested smile.\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cDuke, I haven\u2019t done my best yet!\u201dThe third prince walked past Tartan, who tried to stop him, and stood up.\u201cIf I did my best from the beginning\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, what a fucking loser!\u201dThe corners of Martha\u2019s lips twisted up, and she stood with one foot inside the arena.\u201cYou call yourself a prince, yet you can\u2019t even admit defeat and keep dragging on. You remind me of somebody.\u201dShe turned her head and looked down at Burren who wasn\u2019t doing anything.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dSince he did do something like that in the past, he bit his lip and frowned.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, mister prince. I\u2019m talking kindly right now. Get the fuck out before I start cursing.\u201dWithout minding Burren, who was glaring at her from behind, Martha laughed at the third prince.\u201cHow dare you! Who do you think he is\u2026\u201d\u201cIf he is Owen\u2019s future king, I'm the direct lineage of Zieghart. I don\u2019t lose in any aspect.\u201dMartha didn\u2019t step back, facing Duke Tartan.\u201cStop!\u201dRimmer entered the arena and hid the two people\u2019s faces with his hand.\u201cThe spar is over, but we didn\u2019t hear the opinion of those directly involved. Let\u2019s hear it out first, Raon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRaon, who'd been silent, nodded.\u201cWhat do you wanna do? Since you are the one fighting him, you decide.\u201dRaon slowly turned around and tilted his chin.\u201cI heard the instructor made a bet in this spar. I think the results are clear. There\u2019s no reason to fight anymore.\u201d\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dThe third prince\u2019s clenched fist shook.\u201cYour highness, let\u2019s stop now and lea\u2026\u201d\u201cI admit my defeat!\u201dShaking off Duke Tartan\u2019s staying hand, the third prince stepped up.\u201cI\u2019ve been underestimating you without properly recognizing your power. I\u2019m so embarrassed and ashamed that I can\u2019t raise my head. However, if I leave now, I think I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life. Please fight me once more!\u201dThe third prince dropped his sword, bowing at a 90-degree angle.\u201cY-your highness!\u201dDuke Tartan tried to stop him, but he didn\u2019t move at all.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon could see the sincerity in his blue eyes.\u2018He lowered his head, huh?\u2019The third prince of the Owen Kingdom. The fact that he was accompanied by Duke Tartan meant that he had powerful supporters. He didn\u2019t expect him to apologize like that, after all.\u201cHey, third prince or what, stop that disgraceful act and get ou\u2026\u201d\u201cMartha.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dMartha clicked her tongue and stepped back as Raon called her name.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dDuke Tartan groaned at that sight.\u2018So, the might wasn\u2019t everything he had.\u2019The girl from the direct line, who even went against him, was silenced in a single word. The third prince wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d underestimated Raon.\u201cFine.\u201dRaon nodded and went to the side of the arena.\u201cBut this is the last time.\u201d\u201cO-of course!\u201dThe third prince didn\u2019t look down on him anymore. It looked like he was paying proper respect to him as a warrior.\u201cPlease tell me when you are ready.\u201dRimmer grinned, as if he knew that would happen, and entered the arena.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe third prince took out the lion shaped necklace from his armor and stared at it. Then, as if he had decided on something, he grit his teeth and tore it apart.Whoosh!A powerful wind emanated from his center, and his pressure became almost twice as strong. It wasn\u2019t just his aura; the energy of his trained body could also be felt.\u201cHas he been hiding such energy?\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dBurren and Martha frowned from the powerful pressure emanating from the third prince.\u201cTh-third prince! That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be hiding my strength. I want to fight him with everything I have.\u201dThe third prince raised his sword, wind flowing out between his teeth. The expression seemed to say that he would go all out from the beginning, without being careless anymore.What an idiot, you didn\u2019t even know your opponent was hiding his strength.\u2018I can still win.\u2019He has a lot more aura than you, and his body is also way more complete. Yet are you saying you can win?\u2018Do you wanna bet?\u2019Raon tilted his chin.Hah! Of course! Bring it on.Wrath snorted, and the wager message appeared at the same time.[ is suggesting a bet.]Condition: Victory against the Owen Kingdom\u2019s third prince, Greer De Owen.Success: All stats +4Fail: Creation of 10 points of emotion .\u2018I accept.\u2019Raon accepted as soon as the message appeared.\u2018The doormat is here again.\u2019If Rimmer was the doormat of Zieghart\u2019s gambling house, then Raon\u2019s doormat was Wrath.Holding back the smile trying to leak out, he unsheathed his sword. He\u2019d known from the beginning that the third prince had been hiding his strength.He\u2019d accepted the second challenge because he thought it would be useful for his training to fight the third prince that disclosed his full power, craving victory. He didn\u2019t expect the doormat to come along.\u201cThen, here I go.\u201dThe third prince focused his power on his leg and stepped forward. Destroying a sector of the arena, he dashed towards him like a savage beast.\u201cThis will be more interesting.\u201dBecause there\u2019s something to gain.Raon advanced and struck down the spinning sword.Smaaaack!The third prince\u2019s sword, surrounded by a sky-blue aura, and Raon\u2019s sword, engulfed in a red flame, crashed together.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Screech!Raon and the third prince\u2019s swords screamed as their pressures crashed against each other.Clank!The power that came up from his ankle was incorporated in his forearm muscle. A heaviness like carrying a boulder exploded on the sword\u2019s side.\u201cKuh!\u201dBoth of the third prince\u2019s hands, which were holding the sword, started shaking.\u2018This is crazy!\u2019He\u2019d realized that Raon was powerful from that one defeat, but he didn\u2019t expect his might to be so overwhelming even when he faced him properly.\u201cKuh!\u201dThe third prince grit his teeth and gave a shout of concentration. He swung his sword with everything he had, as being pushed back would result in his defeat.Slam!The two training swords crossed, and the third prince was pushed back to Raon\u2019s left side.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe third prince regained his posture by turning his body, using his left foot as axis. A quick and structured movement, he seemed ready to take on any kind of attack.However, his opponent exceeded his expectations.Thud!Raon moved at the same time, regaining his posture using the River Footwork. Moving as if he was sliding, he appeared at the third prince\u2019s back.\u201cKuh!\u201dSince the third prince was also doing his best, his reactions had gotten faster. He stepped back and thrust his sword.Clank!Raon tilted his sword to push back the third prince\u2019s strike, which was aimed at his wrist.\u201cNot yet!\u201dThe third prince\u2019s sword bent like a living snake, thrusting towards his chest instead of his wrist. His eyes were full of his thirst for victory.Bam!Raon\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t waver. Rotating his training sword in the other direction, he countered the rotation on the third prince\u2019s sword.\u201cKuh!\u201dThe third prince stepped back while groaning. He looked like he couldn\u2019t believe it, his chin trembling.\u201cH-how\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already experienced it once.\u201dRaon glanced at Burren, who could be seen behind the third prince. He\u2019d just canceled out the rotation in his sword, just like when he\u2019d fought against him.\u201cAre you a monster, or a genius\u2026?\u201dThe third prince lowered his posture while biting his lip. Holding his sword with two hands, he turned it diagonally. Even though it was the same posture as before, his pressure felt different.\u2018The Feres Swordsmanship.\u2019It was Feres Swordsmanship, which was only taught to the Owen Kingdom\u2019s future.As swordsmanship was left behind by Feres\u2014the continent\u2019s strongest swordsman a few hundred years ago\u2014it was an advanced martial art that could attack and defend at the same time, containing the flow of the sky.\u201cHaa!\u201dThe third prince gave a firm shout of concentration and stomped on the ground. He dashed in like a tempest and struck upward with his sword.Bam!Without confronting the third prince\u2019s sword, Raon used the River Footwork. Like a twig fluttering in the wind, he grazed the sword.The third prince followed up by striking down the sword that went up. It was a clean application of aura that allowed fast yet balanced movement.Clank!Raon stepped back while deflecting the third prince\u2019s sword using the \u2018Combination Sword\u2019.\u201cI won\u2019t miss you any longer!\u201dThe third prince kept chasing Raon, all while using a more completed Feres Swordsmanship. Just as it was supposed to contain the sky, the blade was filled with a majestic and profound energy.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Raon smirked, feeling the third prince\u2019s sword graze his forehead.\u2018He is different from before.\u2019His might and willpower were both different from before.\u2018I guess that\u2019s to be expected from a prestigious kingdom\u2026\u2019The Owen Kingdom was one of the Six Kings, and there was a good reason why it had acknowledged him. He was perfectly aware of the most important thing in a fight, despite his young age.There was a possibility that he would fight the Owen Kingdom one day. That\u2019s why he wanted to witness the Kingdom\u2019s advanced swordsmanship, and it was indeed an excellent learning experience.Moreover, the third prince kept thinking and adjusting his movements while fighting. He was an interesting opponent.Bang!Raon fiercely parried the third prince\u2019s sword as it twisted into his neck. It was a sharp strike, but he\u2019d already finished analyzing it.Since he\u2019d been using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 while fighting, it wasn\u2019t difficult for him to analyze the swordsmanship. Any technique that the third prince used was being accumulated in Raon\u2019s memory.Bang!Baang!Raon wasn\u2019t using footwork anymore. Firmly standing in place, he deflected all of the third prince\u2019s strikes.\u201cHah\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s crazy!\u201dThe third prince\u2019s eyes widened, and Duke Tartan\u2019s jaw dropped.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dThe third prince exhaled a long breath and took a step back. Straightening his shoulders, he tightened his grip on the sword.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. I still have the last method.\u201dSaying that, he lifted his sword. A high posture, as if he were supporting the sky. He kicked the ground just like that.\u2018Is it a secret technique?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. Advanced swordsmanship had secret techniques, befitting their names. It looked like the third prince was about to use the Feres Swordsmanship\u2019s secret technique.Whoosh!The current exuding from the third prince\u2019s entire body pressed upon him. It was a rush type swordsmanship that struck down after preventing an opponent\u2019s evasion.\u2018I\u2019ll take it on.\u2019Raon pulled his sword to his left, behind him. Since he\u2019d witnessed enough of his swordplay, it was time to finish.The First Flame of \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019.Vortex.The red flame that appeared from the tip of his sword rotated like a cogwheel and pierced through the arena\u2019s heated atmosphere.\u201cHaa!\u201dThe third prince didn\u2019t withdraw, despite seeing the flame burst from Raon\u2019s sword, because he trusted his aura and his sword.Bzzzt!The flame rushed out in a thin line, piercing through the third prince\u2019s aura.\u201cHuh!\u201dBetween the pierced blue aura, the third prince\u2019s widened eyes became visible. However, he wasn\u2019t the third prince of the Owen Kingdom for nothing.Using the last bit of his aura, he filled the gap in his aura.\u201cPointless.\u201dRaon firmly announced, swinging his training sword to the end.\u201cNot yet! My sword is\u2026 huh?\u201dChin trembling, the third prince stopped the sword that he struck down.No, he had no choice but to stop, because his sword was already broken.Raon\u2019s vortex hadn\u2019t only cut through the third prince\u2019s aura, but also his training sword.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dThe third prince sank to his knees. He stared blankly at his broken sword.\u201cI-I was superior in terms of strength and speed\u2026\u2019\u201cStepping back with footwork doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that strength is lacking. Sometimes one steps back on purpose, in order to grasp a better opportunity.\u201d\u201c...I certainly felt it.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The third prince stood up with a sigh. After taking the broken sword and tidying his armor and hair, he stood in front of Raon once again.\u201cThank you. I\u2019ve felt a lot of things thanks to you for accepting the second match. The saying was true. It\u2019s an endless world.\u201dHe lowered his head as he said that. It was a courteous demeanor befitting a prince.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot as well.\u201dRaon bowed towards the third prince as well.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for looking down on you in the beginning. Please consider it this foolish man\u2019s lack of insight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fourteen years old.\u201d\u201cHah! I\u2019ve lost to a swordsman younger than me, both in sword and in personality.\u201dThe third prince laughed dejectedly. His expression showed his original personality.\u201cI think it will be fine if it\u2019s you.\u201dPutting his hand inside his armor, he took out a tablet with the drawing of a blue shining lion, and the name of Greer was written on its back.\u201cPlease accept it.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's proof that the third prince of Owen, Greer De Owen, will accept any request.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes widened. The item that he\u2019d just received from the third prince was a tablet symbolizing the prince, one that could grant his request.\u201cWhy are you giving this to me\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve lost, but my mind has become clearer. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever felt this way, like I\u2019ve been enlightened.\u201dThe third prince murmured that the tablet was cheap compared to what he\u2019d gained.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon reluctantly accepted the tablet.\u201cWe will meet again in the future. Please stay above me until that time, since it will be fun catching up to you.\u201dThe third prince smiled brightly. Stepping out of the arena, he stood in front of Rimmer.\u201cInstructor Rimmer, we have lost. The reward from the bet will be given accordingly.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRimmer nodded with the same smile as before.\u201cDuke Tartan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back. I remembered something I needed to do.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe third prince and Duke Tartan left the training ground alongside the knight trainees.\u201cHmph! He kept putting on airs until the end, so annoying!\u201dMartha snorted with displeasure, kicking the collapsed arena.\u201cPutting on airs\u2026\u201dRaon shook his head while watching the third prince\u2019s back as it disappeared from view. The third prince\u2019s eyes were completely clear.\u2018Probably not.\u2019He had changed, and would continue to change. Just like Burren and Martha.\u2018And\u2026\u2019Raon licked his lips, looking at the tablet in his hand. He\u2019d only accepted the spar for the sake of his training. He didn\u2019t expect to receive something like that.\u2018How curious.\u2019Because he\u2019d only done assassinations without any reward in his previous life, he couldn\u2019t get used to such a sudden reward.He couldn\u2019t understand the purpose and reason behind the gift. However, one thing he understood was that he didn\u2019t have any bad intentions.\u2018This life is also different from what I expected.\u2019***The third prince visited the audience chamber immediately. When he announced his departure earlier than scheduled, the door to the audience chamber opened and the head butler Roenn stepped out.\u201cThe lord says you may enter.\u201d\u201c...Understood.\u201dThe third prince swallowed and followed Roenn into the audience chamber.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dFacing Glenn\u2019s gaze, which didn\u2019t seem to have changed at all from the first time he met him, his breath was taken away.\u201cYour eyes have changed.\u201dAs he was about to kneel, Glenn\u2019s low voice resounded. It looked like he was already aware of everything.\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, but I thought I was the best. I thought I could defeat any talented people from Six Kings, not just in the Owen Kingdom.\u201dThe third prince continued, raising his calm eyes.\u201cAnd that was the same here, in Zieghart. I looked around the training grounds, but I couldn\u2019t find anyone that met my standards. It was the same when I went to the fifth training ground. There were three powerful people, but I thought I could win against them. However\u2026\u201dThe third prince rubbed his right wrist, which had been beaten up by Raon.\u201cThere was a powerful person that I didn\u2019t even recognize. Raon Zieghart. I single-handedly lost after underestimating the might of a trainee younger than me. I insisted on a second match, and also lost that one.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe third prince raised his head slightly at Glenn\u2019s reaction. It felt like the audience chamber\u2019s atmosphere had suddenly gotten softer.It was as if he was telling him to keep talking.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019ve visited and sparred in three places among the Six Kings, but I\u2019ve never seen any trainee like Raon. Might, personality, and mind, he looked like a warrior that was complete in every aspect. Since I lost to a boy like him, I didn\u2019t feel bad at all. I felt enlightened instead.\u201dThe atmosphere in the audience chamber warmed as the third prince kept talking.\u201cThere was a lot to learn from him, despite being younger than me.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I want to go back now. I want to immediately apply everything I\u2019ve realized from watching him.\u201d\u201cI see. Tell the king that I\u2019ve received his kind letter.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter a polite greeting, the third prince left the audience chamber.\u201c...Hup.\u201dInside the audience chamber, where only two people remained, the sound of someone holding back his laughter could be heard. Roenn was covering his mouth, looking at Glenn.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it after seeing my lord\u2019s smiling expression.\u201d\u201cSmiling?\u201dGlenn tried touching his lips with his hand and grimaced.\u201cMy lord has been smiling ever since the third prince of the Owen Kingdom mentioned young master Raon\u2019s name. My lord must be overjoyed that his grandson was praised by another kingdom\u2019s prince.\u201d\u201c...You\u2019re mistaken.\u201dGlenn cleared his throat for no reason, supporting his chin with his left fist.\u201cHup.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRoenn leaked out an even bigger laugh, but he closed his mouth completely at Glenn\u2019s order.\u201cRimmer\u2019s bad habit has transferred to you after spending time with him.\u201dGlenn sighed and closed his eyes. The smile on Roenn\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t seem inclined to disappear any time soon.***\u201cYour highness the third prince, we are ready to leave.\u201dDuke Tartan approached when the third prince came out of the lord\u2019s manor.\u201cThank you for your effort. Since I\u2019ve said my goodbyes, I think we can leave right now.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Everyone, stand in a line.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe knights and knight trainees lined up behind Duke Tartan, following his orders.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe third prince walked at the front, and Duke Tartan licked his lips as he walked next to him.\u201cDo you have something to say?\u201d\u201cWhen you sparred with the trainee Raon, I was thinking it might have been excessive to have used your hidden strength and the Feres Swordsmanship. It would\u2019ve been better to hide your power\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, it was certainly excessive.\u201d\u201cYes. Feres Swordsmanship is the Kingdom\u2019s highest tier swordsmanship. Nothing good will come from showing to in public. Moreover, giving away the godly tablet was too much\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dThe third prince stopped Duke Tartan\u2019s words with his hand.\u201cRaon Zieghart showed favor towards me. He treated me with respect, despite me looking down on him in the beginning.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI was only showing my respect towards him in return. Moreover, he also showed me a swordsmanship that could be called a secret technique.\u201d\u201c...That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAnd giving out that godly tablet was an investment.\u201d\u201cBy investment, you mean?\u201dDuke Tartan tilted his head.\u201cHe has such a might, personality, and mind at that age. Even though he is a collateral, he will certainly become an important figure in the future. One whose name will be known throughout the continent. Being acquainted with such a person might be beneficial for me in the future, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cI see. Reading that far into the future in the spur of the moment, that\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been raised in a kingdom where people live with a knife in their tongue and chest. I would\u2019ve already died if I couldn\u2019t calculate that much.\u201dThe third prince smirked and walked ahead.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dDuke Tartan scratched his chin. His expression was filled with cold-heartedness, unlike when he talked with the third prince.\u2018He\u2019s certainly changed.\u2019The third prince\u2019s arrogance, based on his ability, had completely disappeared. What could be seen from his eyes now was his eagerness to improve.\u201cI really should buy him some drinks.\u201dDuke Tartan smirked, looking at the fifth training ground, which could be seen from the side.\u201cIf we meet again later, that is. And\u2026\u201dHis eyes grew serious as he thought back to Raon, who would be inside the training ground.\u2018I\u2019m curious about what kind of monster he will be the next time I meet him.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45The trainees didn\u2019t move even after the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys had left. They kept staring at Raon\u2019s back, as if they were out of their minds.Since they\u2019d been watching Raon, they knew he was strong. However, since he\u2019d been always moving softly, they\u2019d never imagined he would move so quickly with such powerful strikes.\u201cUh, uhh\u2026\u201d\u201cWas he that strong?\u201d\u201cWh-why is the difference getting larger\u2026\u201dWhen the trainees couldn\u2019t come to their senses, a cheerful clap could be heard from the platform.\u201cGood job, everyone.\u201dRimmer grinned, sitting at the edge of the platform.\u201cThank you for doing your best in the sudden spar.\u201d\u201cYou're welcome!\u201d\u201cThank you for creating an opportunity to spar with the knight trainees of the Owen Kingdom!\u201dThe trainees lowered their heads, expressing their thanks in return.\u201cI\u2019m glad you think that way.\u201dRimmer grinned, fluttering his feet in the air. He looked to be in a better mood than usual.\u201cWell, since everything is over, I should tell you a few things. First of all, you know the knight trainees that fought against you today? They aren\u2019t normal knight trainees.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhat are they, then\u2026?\u201dWhen he stopped speaking, the trainees swallowed.\u201cThey are the elites that the Owen Kingdom is training properly. They are the talented people that will become the royal or silver knights in the future.\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cRoyal knights and silver knights!\u201d\u201cI knew they were too strong\u2026\u201dThe trainees\u2019 jaws dropped.There were only the elite of the elites among the royal and silver knights of the Owen Kingdom.Royal knights were the shields that protected the king in the castle, and silver knights were the swords that threatened their enemies.It wasn\u2019t an understatement to say that the two knight orders were the most elite troops in the Owen Kingdom.The trainees couldn\u2019t hide their surprise at the fact that they\u2019d fought equally against the knight trainees that would belong to such orders.\u201cHaving fought equally against such children is certainly something to be praised for. Give a round of applause for yourselves, everyone!\u201d\u201cYeahhh!\u201d\u201cWowww!\u201d\u201cWe won!\u201dThe trainees raised their hands and shouted with joy.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cHead instructor.\u201dWhen Rimmer was enjoying the cheers, a hand was raised from the center. Burren was standing while still staggering.\u201cCan I fight them again in the future?\u201dBurren\u2019s expression was as wrinkled as if he was facing an enemy.\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost or something.\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t win, it\u2019s not different from losing.\u201d\u201cPersonally, I like that attitude.\u201dRimmer smiled and nodded.\u201cThe knight trainee that you fought against has been called the future captain of the royal knights. If you keep improving yourself, you will meet him again\u2014even if you don\u2019t want to. Of course, when that time comes, he will be a knight instead of a knight trainee. Then\u2026\u201d\u201cI will have to become a swordsman.\u201dA heated haze appeared in Burren\u2019s green eyes.\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cOne more thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIf the knight trainee I fought against was the future royal knights captain, what was the third prince? It wasn't swordsmanship that just any royal blood would have.\u201dBurren\u2019s question was justified. The third prince was ridiculously strong, despite the fact that he was fifteen years old.\u201cI heard the third prince will be the kingdom\u2019s strongest sword in the future.\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe training ground was filled in silence at Rimmer\u2019s response. The trainees turned around to look at Raon, their eyes wide.Their expressions were full of wonder about the kind of monster Raon was, that he could easily defeat the guy who would become the kingdom\u2019s strongest sword.\u201cToday\u2019s training is over. Since you\u2019ve spent more stamina than usual, go back and rest.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands and disappeared from the platform. However, the surprise directed at Raon didn\u2019t disappear from the trainees\u2019 eyes.***Leaving behind the astonished eyes of the trainees, he left the training ground first.He would\u2019ve normally stayed in the training ground to practice, but he was quickly headed to the dormitory because he had something to do.Upon entering the room, he sat on the floor and tapped on the flowery bracelet.Whoosh!Blue ice blossomed like a flower from the bracelet. However, the coldness was trembling as if it was filled with anger.Damn it! How could he lose to you with that kind of power?! I trusted him because he was royal blood, but he is so stupid and inferior!Wrath grit his teeth, filling the entire room with coldness.If the King of Essence was in his position, you would\u2019ve been ripped to shreds by now after becoming a block of ice. He is called a prince, despite not even being able to use his power? How pathetic!It looked like he felt some kinship to the prince since he was a monarch of devildom. He looked really frustrated at losing the bet, to the point that he was angry and talkative at the same time.Back in devildom, the King of Essence could beat down stronger enemies with a smaller amount of mana. Then, during fights between monarchs\u2026\u201cAh, okay. Stop there.\u201dWhen Raon tapped the bracelet, Wrath stopped talking.\u2018I have to stop that at all costs.\u2019Whenever he said, \u2018Back in devildom, the King of Essence\u2019, it was a sign that he had to stop him immediately. If he kept listening to him, he wouldn\u2019t get his reward until the next morning.\u201cYou can talk later. Give me my reward first, okay?\u201dThis is rigged. I didn\u2019t know he was incapable of using the power he had.Actually, the third prince had fought well. But the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019 was just too powerful, regardless of the amount of aura he had.\u201cSo, are you saying you won\u2019t give me my reward? Despite being a monarch of devildom?\u201dWhat do you think the King of Essence is? A human that tells lies habitually? I keep my word, even if it is rigged![You have won the bet against 'Wrath'.][The reward for your victory is being distributed.][All stats have increased by 4.]At the same time as the stat increase message appeared, his whole body shivered, as if he had been electrocuted.\u201cHaaaa\u2026\u201dThe exhilaration of his body and mind growing at once was so electric, he would never get used to it. He could perform any mission if that was for that reward.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Clench.He tried clenching his fist. With his stats increased by 4 at once, he could feel a clear difference in his grip and muscle strength.Status WindowName: Raon Zieghart.Title: First Victory.State: Curse of Frost (Six Strands)Trait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Four-Stars), Water Resistance (Four-Stars), Perception of the Snow Flower (Two-Star), Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation (Two-Stars), Coldness of the Frost (Two-Stars), Fire Resistance (Two-Stars)\u2014Strength: 47Agility: 47Stamina: 48Energy: 36Perception: 58It wasn\u2019t just the rewards. Thanks to his continuous training, his stats had increased a lot. The bigger numbers filled him with joy, just from looking at the status window.Tsk.Wrath clicked his tongue while glancing at the status window that he couldn\u2019t even see. It looked like he was extremely unsatisfied.Are you happy?\u2018I\u2019m happy.\u2019Raon responded without hesitation.Well, you shouldn\u2019t be. No matter how strong you get, you are just a possessed body for the King of Essence. There\u2019s nothing in the world that the King of Essence can\u2019t accomplish.While murmuring that the time was near, he emanated coldness.\u201cAh, okay.\u201dThe temperature had gotten so low that frost fell on his skin, but he didn\u2019t feel cold at all thanks to his \u2018Water Resistance\u2019.\u201cDo your best.\u201dHe pushed away Wrath by shuddering lightly and stood up.Don\u2019t underestimate the King of Essence. Even if it takes a hundred years, your body will end up becoming mine.\u2018Alright.\u2019Gaaaah!When Wrath\u2019s coldness started to erupt like a volcano, he opened the door and went outside.Underestimate him?Of course he wouldn\u2019t.Wrath was an enemy, and the most dangerous one at that.The reason that he cultivated \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 every day, and that he trained his body and mind, was so that he didn\u2019t lose his body to him.Although he acted relaxed in front of him, he was never careless.Dying in vain once was enough. He had to become stronger in order to survive, and for the sake of his revenge.Raon left the dormitory and went back to the training ground, where everyone had left. He swung his sword the whole night.***Three months had passed since Raon sparred with the third prince of the Owen Kingdom.He easily defeated the third prince, who was called the future strongest sword of the kingdom, but Raon only focused on training\u2014as if his victory was left in the past.He recently obtained the nickname \u2018training ghost\u2019, or \u2018training genius\u2019, from the trainees. Though, they only called him by that when he wasn\u2019t around.\u201cI can\u2019t even properly see his sword anymore.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that guy look even stronger now? His swordsmanship and footwork have gotten even more natural.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just look it; he must be stronger.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much.\u201dThe collateral trainees were filled with amazement, watching Raon keep training like a person possessed.\u201cI thought I caught up to him a little, but there\u2019s no way.\u201d\u201cSame. Though, I also trained until the soles of my shoes became rugged\u2026\u201dThe trainees were already impressed and had increased their training time when Raon managed to beat Martha. It wasn\u2019t just after the spars with the Owen Kingdom.They\u2019d thought the difference between them and Raon would\u2019ve decreased a little thanks to their training, but it wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cThis is, erm\u2026\u201d\u201cDifference in talent.\u201d\u201cYes. The talent we are born with is different. We can\u2019t help it if effort can\u2019t bridge the gap\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you really believe you\u2019ve done your best from one pair of shoes getting rugged?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThe trainees turned around when they heard the sharp voice.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cAah\u2026\u201d\u201cL-Lord Burren!\u201dBurren was twisting his lips, his arms crossed.\u201cIt\u2019s easy when you just praise him with a cool word like talent. You can convince yourself that you can\u2019t do it anyway, even if you do your best. However.\u201dWalking past the trainees, he continued.\u201cYou can only say that after breaking ten pairs of shoes, rather than just one.\u201dHis words weren't directed to the trainees, but to himself\u2014the one that had been jealous of Raon without knowing how hard he\u2019d worked.\u201cTh-that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize to me. It\u2019s your life, after all.\u201dBurren picked up the training sword that was behind the trainees and headed towards the center of the training ground.\u201cYoung master Burren\u2026 Doesn\u2019t it feel like he\u2019s become softer?\u201d\u201cHe would\u2019ve completely ignored us before\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, someone is coming. Shut your mouth!\u201d\u201cHup!\u201dThe trainees closed their mouths, seeing Martha approaching from the left side.Tap.Martha took out a training shoulder and put it on her shoulder. Fluttering the short hair that barely reached her shoulders, she walked towards the training ground before she stopped.\u201cHe became softer?\u201dShe glanced at the trainees with clear disdain.\u201cHe is like a volcano right before its eruption, yet you call him soft. Your eyes are worse than a rotten orc\u2019s.\u201dMartha sneered and walked towards the training ground.Raon and Runaan moved their bodies without any break, and Burren and Martha swung their swords without losing to him.\u201cWow, it\u2019s so breathtaking.\u201dThe trainees sighed, shaking their heads.Monsters lived in the fifth training ground. And there were four of them\u2026\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. But\u2026\u201dOne of the trainees was looking at his training shoes, before he raised his head.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the best place to increase our abilities?\u201d\u201cHmm, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dThe other trainees nodded. They\u2019d certainly been improving a lot faster ever since they arrived at the fifth training ground.\u201cWe should start as well.\u201dFinishing their short break, the trainees entered the training ground once again, wielding training swords.\u201cHow nice.\u201dRimmer was sitting on the tree behind them with a smile on his face.\u201cWith the pillars holding on so well, the rest follow.\u201dHe looked at Raon, Burren, Runaan, and Martha\u2014in that order\u2014as they swung their swords in the middle of the training ground. Since those four children, all with different characteristics, were doing their best\u2026 Those who were behind naturally followed.The four of them were actually contributing to the children\u2019s growth more than the instructors.\u201cHmm.\u201dRimmer curled his red hair as he sat on the tree, then nodded.\u201cIt should be fine to have them participate in a real battle.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Raon dashed forward and slashed his sword. The burning blade mercilessly ripped apart the evening air.Creak!The aura\u2019s reverberation after splitting the ground gouged the floor of the training ground like a beast\u2019s claw.It was a dash type sword technique, created from combining the 'Star-Combining Sword' and the last movement of the \u2018River Footwork\u2019.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Raon nodded, spinning his sword. Even if one saw through the technique, it would\u2019ve been difficult to block it because of its great power and speed.\u2018And of course, that\u2019s not all.\u2019It was a surprise attack that could be used whenever or wherever, like a knife hidden in the back.It couldn\u2019t be helped that he kept thinking about surprise attacks, since the temperament of an assassin still seemed to remain.He turned his head around, hearing a humming sound. Runaan was watching her sword with blank eyes.However, the bottom of those blank eyes were shining slightly. It was an expression full of expectation. It seemed like she wanted him to teach her the technique.\u201cHaap!\u201dAs if she was copying him, Runaan kicked off from the ground and thrust her sword in the air.Without any speed, power, nor the principle of a surprise attack, all she was doing was copying his posture. However, since her talent and abilities were excellent to start with, the movement was going to be pretty difficult to block.\u201cIs this right?\u201dRunaan swung her sword a few more times, then tilted her head to ask him whether that was correct.\u201cRather than that, with the legs\u2014like this\u2026\u201dSince he thought she might end up killing someone in a spar, he corrected her posture a little.Whoosh!When Runaan\u2019s posture was mostly corrected, a cool wind came over the training ground\u2019s walls. Rimmer had arrived.When he arrived on time, he entered by kicking open the front door. When he was late, he came in over the walls.That meant that it was already past the end of training.\u201cHmph!\u201dRimmer sat at the edge of the platform and looked down on the trainees.\u201cInstructor, you are ten minutes late.\u201d\u201cGood job on your training today.\u201dIgnoring Burren\u2019s remark, he turned his head.\u201cTen minutes are enough time to swing a sword ten thousand times.\u201d\u201cHaa? That\u2019s going too far! Ugh!\u201dRimmer frowned after answering Burren's ridiculous statement. He seemed to have realized that was his purpose.\u201cAhem. Anyway, I have two things to tell you today. The first is about the sixth training ground.\u201d\u201cThe sixth training ground?\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s where those who\u2019ve failed here went, right?\u201dThe trainees tilted their heads, asking why he was suddenly talking about the training ground where the dropouts went.\u201cApparently their pride was hurt because of the way that the Owen Kingdom\u2019s envoys belittled them and only asked to spar with the fifth training ground. They are now training until they bleed in order to catch up to us.\u201dRimmer grinned, saying that he was proud of the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees.\u201cThe direct line and the collateral that dropped out due to injury also joined them recently, and they are training using the most difficult method, so you shouldn\u2019t be careless. Do your best every moment so that they won\u2019t catch up to you.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEhh\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not even possible to catch up.\u201dThe trainees pouted. Since they\u2019d made a huge gap already, they didn\u2019t seem to feel the necessity to be careful about them.\u201cHah.\u201dRimmer nodded, as if he had already expected that reaction, and told them the second bit of news.\u201cThere will be very special training next week.\u201d\u201cWh-what is it?\u201dDorian, who was already scared, started trembling.\u201cSpecial training, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat is it? What else is left to do?\u201dSince Rimmer had done many strange things in the past, every trainee felt uneasy, not just Dorian.\u201cOf course it\u2019s a secret.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cInstructor, you have to tell us in advance what kind of training it is so that we can prepare ourselves.\u201dBurren raised his hand and argued with reason, but of course it didn\u2019t work against Rimmer.\u201cIt\u2019s not fun if I tell you. No matter what it is, you\u2019ll be able to do it if you train hard enough.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSince he wasn\u2019t wrong, Burren pouted and lowered his hand.\u201cBut if I were to give you a hint\u2026\u201dRimmer raised one finger and smiled. Unlike his usual light or cheerful smile, it was filled with an intense fighting spirit.\u201cIt\u2019s a real battle.\u201d\u201cA real battle?\u201d\u201cThat was unexpected.\u201dThe trainees\u2019 eyes widened at hearing that it was a real battle instead of a spar.\u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected, but it was about time. Since you said you would prepare, I\u2019ll tell you one thing for sure.\u201dThe craftiness around in his expression started to disappear. His smile was instead filled with a frightening amount of seriousness.\u201cYou should be prepared for bloodshed.\u201d***After training, Rimmer left the household and went to the entertainment street located in the western suburb.He walked down the street while humming and entered the pub called the \u2018Wooden Lotus\u2019, located at the eastern end.Unlike its elegant name, the pub was old-fashioned and messy. The seats were full and deafening noise was coming from the people talking all over the place.Rimmer nodded, apparently enjoying the messy atmosphere, and approached the middle-aged man sitting alone on the right side.\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201dSitting in front of the middle-aged man, he grinned.\u201cBecause magicians have enough time to waste.\u201dThe middle-aged man was wearing a black robe. He was reading a book when Rimmer spoke to him and he nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Sir Rimmer.\u201d\u201cHow have you been, my dear drinking companion?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been living well, and idle.\u201d\u201cYou look relaxed, thanks to becoming the vice master of magic tower.\u201d\u201cHaha. Isn\u2019t Sir Rimmer the one with plenty of time to spare? The title \u2018salary thief\u2019 was created for you.\u201dThe middle-aged man grinned, closing his book.\u201cSince I\u2019ve been pretty busy recently, I miss the days when I used to do nothing but drink with you.\u201d\u201cI heard you spend a lot of time with the trainees, that you look after them with utmost care.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not that much.\u201dTheir conversation went as smooth as velvet. It looked like they were close acquaintances.\u201cVerbin. What have you been doing recently?\u201d\u201cSince Sir Rimmer doesn\u2019t come out to drink any more, reading books has been my only joy in life recently.\u201dThe man named Verbin shook the book he was holding.\u201cSince researching and reading books are the only things to do in the magic tower.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dRimmer nodded, looking at the magic book in Verbin\u2019s hand.\u201cSo, why did you call me out today? Judging from your expression, it wasn\u2019t simply to have drinks together.\u201d\u201cI did want to drink, but I also have a request.\u201d\u201cA request?\u201d\u201cSince my students have become pretty talented, I want to let them experience a real fight against monsters.\u201d\u201cHmm. In that case, you could\u2019ve made an official request.\u201dVerbin tilted his head. Letting trainees fight the monsters was one of the official curriculums. There was no reason for him to visit him personally to make a request.\u201cI\u2019d like to add a few things.\u201d\u201cWhat would you like to add?\u201d\u201cSince my boys are pretty strong, the normal monsters won\u2019t be helpful at all.\u201d\u201cAh. I heard they beat up the knight trainees from the Owen Kingdom.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201dRimmer grinned with a sharp noise. He was in a good mood, almost as if he was drunk, from receiving compliments on his students from an old friend of his.\u201cI want to strengthen the monsters that would fight against the trainees. At around an advanced sword beginner level.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. A guy who entered the magic tower a few years ago is specialized in summoning and controlling monsters. He can even make a worm have the power of a dragon.\u201d\u201cI-is that even possible?\u201d\u201cThat was a joke.\u201d\u201cAh, seriously\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, a worm can\u2019t become like a dragon, but it\u2019s pretty easy to make an orc an advanced sword beginner. Although we can\u2019t strengthen many of them at once, and it\u2019s only limited to one at a time.\u201dVerbin murmured that it wasn\u2019t really a difficult task.\u201cThank you. And one more thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cCan you use the hallucination magic to make the monster look like a human?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also an easy task. Since they are children that haven\u2019t even reached an Expert\u2019s level, one artifact with hallucination magic would be enough.\u201d\u201cGreat. Please do that, too.\u201dRimmer flicked his finger and gulped down the beer on the table at once.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t the trial become too difficult to overcome for the trainees if strengthening and hallucination magic are used at the same time?\u201dVerbin furrowed his brow, caressing his glass.\u201cIt will be difficult enough for them to fight against an orc with strengthened physical abilities. If they saw it as a human, they won\u2019t even be able to swing their swords properly.\u201d\u201cHell yeah! This is the taste!\u201dRimmer exclaimed, slamming down his glass of beer on the table.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cI said it would be difficult for the trainees to win. Monster strengthening is one thing, but it\u2019s really difficult for little children to kill a monster that they see as a human.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Because my students are swordsmen, not little children. Moreover\u2026\u201dRimmer grinned. Anticipation and joy were mixed in his dark green eyes.\u201cThey are strong, both in body and mind.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The magical lamp chased off the darkness in the fifth training ground.Most of the trainees had returned to their homes, but some children still remained, swinging their swords.Runaan Sullion was one of them. Staying in the training ground, she practiced the stab that Raon had shown her.Pang!Runaan lowered her posture and thrust her sword. A fast and powerful strike pierced through the air, but it didn\u2019t feel right.\u2018I can\u2019t do it well.\u2019Raon\u2019s stab was smooth and relaxed, rather than powerful. It felt so natural that she didn\u2019t even realize he was about to stab.No matter how many times she watched, she couldn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d done that.She looked towards the indoor gymnasium. Raon was currently doing his muscle training, and she didn\u2019t want to bother him.\u2018Let\u2019s try a few more times.\u2019Getting ready once again, she thrust her sword into the air. She tried changing her posture, but the strike wasn\u2019t really different.\u2018One more time.\u2019The sound of a blade piercing the air changed slightly. The speed and power were reduced slightly, but the edge of the sword seemed a bit relaxed.She stopped moving her hand when the moon rising from the east moved by the size of two creases on a finger.\u201cHaa.\u201dRunaan visibly nodded.\u2018It worked, a little.\u2019She still had a long way to go before catching up to Raon, but the last movement of the 'Star-Combining Sword' had clearly changed. Despite its strength and speed being reduced, its combination and smoothness had become far better.___T/N: The \u2018Combination Sword\u2019 will be referred to as the \u2018Star-Combining Sword\u2019 from this moment on.___\u201cHmm.\u201dRunaan looked at the indoor gymnasium once again. The light was still on, and shouts of concentration from Raon, Burren, and Martha could be heard.While she was wondering about what to do, she remembered what her mother had told her.\"I\u2019ll have the bead ice cream ready for you, so come back early on the weekend.\"\u2018I gotta go.\u2019Runaan immediately returned the training sword. Deciding to ask him about what she was lacking next week, she left the training ground.It was when she was about to run towards the training grounds outside in order to quickly return to where the maids were waiting that it happened. A man\u2019s shadow was visible in a dark alley.\u201cRunaan.\u201dAs she was about to pass by and ignore him, the shadow took a step forward and called her name.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRunaan stood still. Her eyes, which were always blank, were shaking as if they were hit by a wave.The man appeared. With short silver hair and dark purple eyes, he was a handsome young man with an appearance similar to Runaan\u2019s.\u201cBro\u2026ther?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dRunaan took a step back with trembling lips, and the man took three steps forward, smiling softly.Syria Sullion.He was Runaan\u2019s older brother, and the man who put his name on the Twelve Stars of the Continent as the biggest genius in the history of House Sullion.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHowever, Runaan\u2014who\u2019d seen Syria after a long time\u2014was as white as a sheet, as if she\u2019d encountered a powerful opponent instead of her older brother.\u201cRunaan, didn\u2019t I tell you to not make that face?\u201dSyria smiled. His smile was relaxed, and his speech was soft.However, if one looked at his expression carefully, they would\u2019ve felt terrified. Because unlike his mouth, his eyes weren\u2019t smiling at all.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRunaan clenched her teeth and lowered her head. As if she forced her turbulent emotions to calm down, her trembling purple eyes settled down in the darkness.\u201cYes, that\u2019s how you should be.\u201dSyria kept smiling and approached Runaan to stroke her head.\u201cIt looks like Rimmer\u2019s training is pretty good. You\u2019ve become stronger than I thought.\u201dHe bent over and met Runaan\u2019s eyes.At that moment, the mask on Syria\u2019s face was dropped. His expression was as stiff as a rotten tree, and the light disappeared from his eyes. He looked like an emotionless monster.\u201cI hope you won\u2019t be doing things like going onto a battlefield, or dueling with your life on the line.\u201dHis voice also changed. It was a terribly dry voice, like the desert\u2019s north wind that dried lives up to death.\u201cAah\u2026\u201dRunaan\u2019s shoulders trembled. Grabbing her own hands, she stepped backward.\u201cHmm, did it become weaker? I need to carve it into you again.\u201dSyria put his hand in his coat\u2019s inner pocket. He took out a round-eyed squirrel.\u201cWas Ruby the name of the squirrel you used to raise?\u2019\u201cB-brother?\u201dRunaan stopped stepping back. She extended her hand towards the squirrel, trying to grab it.\u201cYou will remember now. The way Ruby died, and the reason you became afraid of blood.\u201d\u201cW-wait!\u201dSyria smiled with his immobile eyes and put force on his right hand. With a blasting sound, his hand that used to hold a squirrel in it only had a handful of bloodstains remaining.\u201cAaargh!\u201dRunaan screamed and sank to her knees, but nobody could hear the sound because of the energy barrier that Syria had put up.\u201cRunaan.\u201dSyria approached Runaan, who was on her knees. He whispered in her ears with a lifeless voice.\u201cYou are mine. Until that day comes, don\u2019t do anything dangerous or difficult.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cJust keep breathing until I need you\u2026\u201dBang!As Syria was about to brainwash Runaan, a thundering noise resounded throughout the alley.A blonde-haired boy appeared through the dust rising from the crumbled ground. His red eyes were staring at Syria.\u201cWho are you?\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he couldn\u2019t see her. Strangely, it looked like she\u2019d left first.\u2018It\u2019s annoying when she is around, but I miss her a bit now that she is gone.\u2019Runaan would always wait for him to finish training, then leave after saying goodbye with a nod.It didn\u2019t feel like anything special, but now that he didn\u2019t get that greeting, he missed it a little.\u2018How come I\u2019m missing that? Was I brainwashed?\u2019Raon smirked and left the training ground. Since Burren and Martha were still in there, he didn\u2019t need to clear up like he usually did.How pathetic.\u2018What?\u2019It shouldn\u2019t be the time to think about such a thing.\u2018What do you mean?\u2019......Wrath didn\u2019t continue. Without saying anything, he just stared towards the west.\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019Raon turned his head towards the direction that Wrath was looking. Even though he couldn\u2019t sense anything, he had a strange feeling.\u2018Just in case.\u2019Rotating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, he used the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019. He also activated the \u2018Perception of the Snow Flower\u2019 to spread his perception wide.Tick!Something was caught up in his perception nearby. However, he still couldn\u2019t sense anything.Which meant\u2026\u2018Someone has used an energy barrier.\u2019An unknown person had used their aura to block sound and their presence.\u2018I should go check.\u2019He normally wouldn\u2019t have cared what they were doing, but he figured he should check it out because of Wrath\u2019s reaction.Using the shadow footwork to completely hide his presence in case he needed to run away, he ran towards where the area energy barrier was set up.Inside the dark alley, without any of the house\u2019s swordsman guards, two people were standing.One of them was Runaan, and the other was a tall man.\u2018Why is she there? And that expression is\u2026\u2019He\u2019d thought Runaan had returned home, but she was grabbing her hands right in front of him. Her expression was normal, but her eyes seemed frightened.He looked at the man.A handsome man with silver hair and purple eyes like Runaan was standing there with a greatsword on his back.\u2018Syria Sullion.\u2019He\u2019d heard that name in his previous life.He was the genius of House Sullion, who\u2019d put his name on the Twelve Stars of the Continent, who are the twelve monsters that are expected to become the Ten Heavens of the Continent in the future.\u2018Why is she afraid?\u2019Despite seeing her older brother, Runaan didn\u2019t smile or look happy. Instead, she was as scared as a rabbit that had met a savage beast.Syria was saying something to Runaan, but he couldn\u2019t really hear it. He suddenly took out a cute squirrel from his chest and offered it to Runaan.Then, the moment Runaan extended her hand, he crushed the squirrel.Arrrgh!Although he couldn\u2019t hear the sound because of the energy barrier, he could at least tell that Runaan was screaming.With a terrifyingly dry expression, Syria approached Runaan and started to whisper in her ear.\u2018I have to stop him.\u2019He didn\u2019t understand what was going on, but it felt like he couldn\u2019t let him continue.Raon advanced, fully utilizing the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019.Bang!The ground collapsed and a thundering noise burst out. He could see Syria frowning, stepping away from Runaan.\u201cWho are you?\u201dWithout missing his opportunity, Raon stood in front of Runaan. Tilting his head, he glared at Syria.\u201cWho are you to be bullying Runaan?\u201dHe had to pretend he didn\u2019t know him.If he knew that Syria was Runaan\u2019s family, he couldn\u2019t interfere. After all, he was her family.However, if he pretended that he didn\u2019t know, it became possible for him to interfere.\u201cIf you are asking for someone\u2019s name, shouldn\u2019t you give yours first?\u201dSyria smiled leisurely.\u201cThat\u2019s not something you should say when you set up an energy barrier in an alley like this. Are you a thief?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSyria frowned as Raon mocked him. However, it felt like he was acting\u2014as if he was pretending to be angry when he was neither flustered nor angry.\u2018I know the type of person that would act like this would be.\u2019Derus Robert, who\u2019d killed him in his previous life. He could smell the same stench from Syria.\u201cAh, I guess you could misunderstand like that. But I\u2019m neither a thief nor a stranger. I\u2019m her older brother.\u201dSyria pointed at Runaan, who was behind Raon.\u201c......\u201dBlocking Syria\u2019s gaze, Raon took a glance at Runaan. Her expression was still blank, but it was a different kind of blankness than usual. She looked like she was immensely shocked, with her shoulders trembling so much that he felt sorry for her.\u201cShe looks like she\u2019s scared. Are you really her older brother?\u201d\u201cAh, I played a prank on her, since we haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time. Now she\u2019s like that.\u201d\u201cIs crushing a squirrel in your hand a prank?\u201d\u201cAh, this isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s just a toy.\u201dWhen Syria swung his hand, the bloodstains in his hand and floor turned into ash and were blown away. He\u2019d completely melted the flesh and blood using his aura.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve really killed a squirrel, right?\u201dA terrifying pressure emanated from his entire body. It was a stench of death, similar to the scent he\u2019d gotten from Derus before dying to him.Insolence. How dare a mere human threaten the King of Essence\u2019s possessed body?Raon didn\u2019t respond and pulled up his pressure. Just as Wrath said, he was threatening him. He was warning him that he should withdraw, since he could kill him exactly the same way.However, he hadn\u2019t come without any preparation.\u201cRaon! You bastard, did you just damage the House\u2019s property!\u201dBurren, who was on the training ground, ran out. The swordsmen that were standing guard were also running towards them. He could also hear Martha cursing from afar about her training being disturbed.\u201cRaon. You were Raon Zieghart. I see.\u201dSyria\u2019s eyes turned completely dark, like a bead covered in a black ink. Raon\u2019s hair prickled because his eyes looked like his emotions had been rubbed out.\u201cIt really is a misunderstanding. Since I received a long-term mission right after I\u2019ve returned, I just wanted to give my little sister some snacks.\u201dHe took out a rectangular box and put it on the ground. The shape and design were slightly different, but it was a bead ice cream box.\u201cRunaan.\u201dSyria\u2019s eyes changed once again. They were the eyes of an older brother looking at his beloved little sister.\u201cYou have a great friend. Keep getting along with him in the future.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if my pranks were excessive. Please take care, see you again next time.\u201dHe waved his hand and disappeared, as if he became the wind.\u201cNo way. Was he actually the Syria Sullion from the Twelve Stars of the Continent?\u201dBurren gasped, looking at where Syria used to be.\u201cHis atmosphere is different. He isn\u2019t one of the Twelve Stars for nothing.\u201d\u201cIndeed, he is different.\u201dRaon nodded. Since he was called a genius and a hero, he\u2019d never thought he was such a crazy bastard.\u201cRunaan.\u201dHe turned around to look at Runaan. Her expression was the same as always, but her eyes were shaking. It looked like she was still scared.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll see you off.\u201dSince Syria said he had a mission, he wasn\u2019t going to be at home.\u201c...Okay.\u201dRunaan nodded slowly and stood up.\u201cDid something happen?\u201dBurren approached them, holding the bead ice cream box in his hand.\u201cNothing special.\u201dRaon accepted the box instead and shook his head.\u201cIs that so?\u201dBurren didn\u2019t press any further.\u201cTell me if you need any help. As a fellow trainee, I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help you.\u201dAfter saying that, he left the alley.\u2018He really has grown up a lot.\u2019Burren had changed so much, to the point that it made him proud just watching him.But the King of Essence still doesn\u2019t like his eyes\u2026\u2018Thank you.\u2019What?\u2018It was thanks to you that I could save Runaan. I\u2019m not sure if I really managed to save her, though.\u2019Ahem! That girl is the King of Essence\u2019s ice cream girl. I only told you about it because it felt like I couldn\u2019t eat any more ice cream if something troublesome happened.\u2018That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m thanking you for.\u2019Then ask her to give some of that ice cream\u2026\u2018I could\u2019ve seen you in a different light if you hadn\u2019t said that.\u2019Raon tapped Wrath away with his hand. That damn monarch really couldn\u2019t read the situation.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dHe brought Runaan to where the people from House Sullion were waiting.Raon didn\u2019t say anything as he walked next to Runaan.It was someone else\u2019s family, and he didn\u2019t know their exact circumstances. He was well aware that trying to awkwardly comfort her wasn\u2019t going to help in any way.When Runaan\u2019s steps became slow, he did the same. He stopped when she did. He just silently walked next to her, keeping his pace with her.It didn\u2019t take long until House Sullion\u2019s carriage and maids came into sight.Raon watched until Runaan got on the carriage, then handed her over the ice cream box that he was holding.\u201cThank you.\u201dRunaan left after speaking the words glumly, where she had once said them with a cheerful voice.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *When Runaan arrived at the mansion, Rokan Sullion came out to meet her.\u201cRunaan! Good job on your training.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded and left the carriage.\u201cDid you meet your older brother? He went to you, saying he wanted to give you a present personally.\u201d\u201c...Mhm.\u201dAfter taking a deep breath, Runaan showed him the ice cream box. Her eyes were blank, as usual.\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite ice cream. He seems to always think about you, despite being busy with missions and training.\u201dRokan murmured that he didn\u2019t get any presents for him and burst into laughter.Runaan clenched her jaw. She considered revealing everything that happened, but she felt like everything she\u2019d been protecting would collapse.\u201c...I\u2019m going to rest.\u201dSwallowing her words, she went up the mansion\u2019s stairs.\u201cOf course! You must be tired. Rest well.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRokan gestured his hand to go ahead. Runaan nodded and went to the second floor.\u201cHaa.\u201dOnce Runaan entered her room, she sighed and settled on the ground. Biting her lip, she opened the ice cream box.It was her favorite ice cream, but she didn\u2019t want to touch it. She could only remember her older brother\u2019s face.\u2018He came again. He is the same as before.\u2019Syria Sullion hadn\u2019t always been like that.After he came back from his second mission, where he was the only survivor, he\u2019d changed. It was as if he was a completely different person\u2026 And only towards her.For everyone else, he was still the kind and polite genius swordsman. But to her, he\u2019d become a monster of obsession of unknown origins.\u2018Ruby\u2026\u2019The Ruby that he\u2019d spoken about was a red-eyed squirrel that lived in a nearby tree when she was younger.Since they got along, she\u2019d named her Ruby and used to play with her every day. But one day, Ruby scratched her hand.Ruby was stressed out during her pregnancy and had caused a very small injury. However, Syria\u2014who\u2019d seen it\u2014caught every squirrel, including Ruby, in the area. Then he\u2019d crushed them in front of her eyes.That was when he told her.\u2018You are mine. You can\u2019t get hurt. Just keep breathing and live on.\u2019If she told her father or mother about it, the house would be broken into pieces. He threatened that he would burn everyone except for her.After that day, Runaan stopped speaking.Since someone else could fall victim, she didn\u2019t get close to anyone\u2014humans and animals alike\u2014and spoke as sparsely as she could.She\u2019d been living alone like that, and one day she met a loner, a boy who looked even more lonely and full of suffering than herself.Raon.At first, she was just curious about how he could grow so quickly, and how he could endure with his bad constitution and stamina.Simple curiosity. She\u2019d approached him because she was a little bit curious about his growth.That was how she was able to learn.She learned what kind of person Raon was. How much effort he\u2019d been putting in, and the kind of hardships he went through.Looking at the boy that changed other people\u2019s gazes with effort, she thought she could also change herself, and actually started to change.Thanks to Raon and the trainees from the fifth training ground, she\u2019d started to forget about her fear of Syria.But she had been reminded of that fear once again.Runaan kept staring at the ice cream inside the box until it completely melted.\u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201dLowering her head between her knees, she murmured in a wet voice.\u201cEverything will be okay, as long as I endure it.\u201dIt seemed like she couldn\u2019t eat the ice cream ever again.***After Raon saw Runaan off and went to the dormitory, Wrath burst from the bracelet.Was he really human?\u2018What?\u2019The one supposed to be the ice cream girl\u2019s older brother.\u2018Ah. He was a weirdo for sure.\u2019Raon nodded. Syria certainly had a friendly and soft atmosphere, but he also felt terrifying\u2014like facing darkness.In particular, his eyes when he was threatening were devoid of life, like a dried-out leaf. It sent chills down the spine just from looking at them.However, his acting was top notch. If he didn\u2019t see him crushing the squirrel and threatening Runaan, he would\u2019ve been tricked as well.\u2018He\u2019s a crazy bastard, just like Derus.\u2019Syria didn\u2019t seem to feel human emotions. Unlike Raon, who\u2019d been taught that way, it looked like something was broken in him.\u2018But since he said he is on a long-term mission, he won\u2019t be back for a while.\u2019As long as he is the ice cream girl\u2019s older brother, problems will keep happening.\u2018That\u2019s true.\u2019Even if Syria didn\u2019t return for several years, he would end up meeting Runaan over and over in the future, as he was her family.No, maybe he is still keeping a watch on her. What was contained in his dry eyes was clearly an obsession.Give me your body. I\u2019ll kill him and return it to you.\u2018Huh?\u2019The King of Essence returns the favor twice and gets back at an enemy tenfold. Since the girl showed me a new world called the bead ice cream, I can do this much for her.\u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019Raon sneered and shook his hand.I\u2019m serious!\u2018Even if you are serious, that can\u2019t happen.\u2019Why?\u2018He traumatized Runaan. Even if you kill him, the trauma won\u2019t disappear. At worst, she might end up being even more suffocated. In this case, she has to stand up on her own, and\u2026\u2019Raon tapped the ground with his finger.\u2018If it\u2019s about killing him, I can do it too.\u2019In his previous and current life combined, Runaan was a stranger who was the most considerate towards him.Since he\u2019d received a huge amount of help, he could kill Syria for her.You\u2019ve really lost your senses. You won\u2019t be able to win against him even if there were a hundred of you. He is already a master.Wrath frowned, telling him to stop his nonsense.\u2018He certainly is strong.\u2019If you know that, why are you sprouting nonsense?\u2018Because that\u2019s not the reason why a blade can\u2019t cut his throat.\u2019Raon tapped the sheath of his sword, emanating a chilly pressure.\u201cThere is more than one way of killing somebody.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt an intense pressure from Karoon Zieghart, who was looking at him. His throat trembled.\u2018Why did he call me?\u2019Their status was as far apart as the earth from the heavens, and they weren\u2019t related in any way. He couldn\u2019t understand why he had called him.\u201cI heard that you will be supporting the fifth training ground for actual battle training next week.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! That\u2019s true.\u201dJake lowered his head with a trembling voice. He was supposed to support the fifth training ground\u2019s actual battle training, following Verbin\u2019s command as the vice master of the magic tower.\u201cI called on you because I have a request.\u201d\u201cA request\u2026?\u201dKaroon was one of the influential figures of Zieghart. Granting his request would certainly help him immensely in the future.\u201cP-please tell me.\u201dStuttering a bit, Jake lowered his head.\u201cIn this actual battle training, I heard an orc was going to be summoned against the children.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAbout that orc, can it be strengthened?\u201d\u201cThat was already requested by the fifth training ground\u2019s head instructor. He said a normal orc wasn\u2019t suitable for the drill because the trainees are too good.\u201d\u201cAh, not just that, but I\u2019m asking if it can be strengthened to a point where they stand no chance of winning.\u201d\u2018Should they have no chance of winning?\u2019Jake swallowed.\u2018Is he targeting one of the children?\u2019It looked like Karoon was planning to either kill or hurt one of the children from the fifth training ground.\u201cIt\u2019s possible! If you tell me which trainee is your target\u2026\u201d\u201cTarget? That\u2019s some strange thing to say.\u201dKaroon\u2019s cold voice resounded throughout the extensive Central Martial Palace.\u201cAh, e-excuse me. I need to be careful since my magic sometimes goes awry. Which trainee should I be paying attention to in particular?\u201d\u201cHmph. It\u2019s Raon.\u201dKaroon, who seemed satisfied with his wording, slowly nodded.\u201cRaon Zieghart\u2026\u201dJake\u2019s eyes shone. He knew that Raon had defeated Burren, who was Karoon\u2019s son. He could finally understand Karoon\u2019s intentions.\u2018He is targeting Raon.\u2019After winning against the third prince of the Owen Kingdom recently, he\u2019d been praised as the very best among the trainees. There was no doubt that Karoon\u2019s target was Raon.\u201cDespite it being a drill, it\u2019s pretty common to get injured during actual battle training. And there are rare occasions of that injury being permanent.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ve seen that happen a few times as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve prepared a decent monster.\u201dWhen Karoon snapped his fingers, the butler that was standing at his right side brought along an orc over two meters tall.Jake swallowed hard. He could immediately tell since he was very experienced with dealing with orcs. Even though the orc in front of him looked plain, he was at an extraordinary level.\u201cIt\u2019s an orc from the Dollan Mountains.\u201d\u201cDollan Mountains\u2026\u201dThe Dollan Mountains were a vicious area where many powerful monsters resided. An orc living there would\u2019ve been at a completely different level from a normal orc.\u201cI\u2019d like you to look after him by sending out this orc, so that no misfortune will happen to him.\u201dKaroon rolled up the corners of his lips. He told him to look after him, but he meant to give him a permanent injury using the orc.\u201cAh. And if, by any chance, the orc ends up causing trouble\u2014take care of it immediately, so that it won\u2019t cause any problem afterwards. If you properly complete this job, I\u2019ll recommend you as the vice master of the magic tower in the future.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d\u201cYou should leave.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll obey no matter what.\u201dJake bowed until his nose almost touched the ground. Saving the orc using the Save Monster magic, he left Karoon\u2019s room.\u201cDid anyone see him come here?\u201dKaroon turned his head to the butler that had brought the orc.\u201cSince he took a detour to the inner part, there\u2019s no one that knows the magician came to this place.\u201d\u201cHe has quick wits. Support him once he successfully handles this matter.\u201d\u201cShall I support him until he becomes the vice master of the magic tower?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Just enough that he will do anything to get more.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe butler smiled. He bowed his head and left the room.\u201cRaon Zieghart\u2026\u201dKaroon murmured Raon\u2019s name in a low voice.He won against his son Burren, defeated Martha, and made the third prince kneel even though he was called Owen\u2019s future.As the master of Central Martial Palace and division leader of Striding Steads, it wasn\u2019t a big deal to him. However, his activity was becoming an eyesore.More importantly, he was getting Father\u2019s attention, albeit slightly.He wasn\u2019t going to be an obstacle to Karoon becoming the head of house, but getting rid of annoying things as fast as possible was the correct course of action.\u2018I should get rid of him before he grows up even more.\u2019That was the way he\u2019d grown up, and the method he was taught in that cold place.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After finishing his night training in the training ground, Raon returned to the annex building. He walked through the hallway silently because it was late at night, yet Sylvia\u2019s door burst open.\u201cRaon!\u201dAa the door collided against the wall, Sylvia dashed out, a red light radiating from her eyes.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cDid you just say ugh from seeing your mother? Ugggghhhh?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you promise to stroll through the garden with your mom or not?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dRaon\u2019s jaw dropped.\u2018I forgot.\u2019Because of what happened the day before, he was so focused on training that he\u2019d completely forgotten about it.\u201cYou forgot! You definitely forgot!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? This is the first time in three days that I\u2019m seeing you awake!\u201dSylvia walked towards him and raised her hand.\u201cM-Mom?\u201dRaon stepped back, frowning.\u201cWhy do you think I asked you to promise me a stroll?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cTraining is great, but resting is also important. Because rest is part of training.\u201dSylvia smiled softly and started patting Raon's head.\u201cSince you are training at the training ground every day, please rest when you are here. At least for half a day.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201dRaon lowered his head.\u2018I don\u2019t know what to do whenever I\u2019m in front of her.\u2019Sylvia, Helen, and the maids. It wasn\u2019t that he disliked them.If he actually disliked them, he would\u2019ve run away already.Since he was afraid of his affection growing even further towards those who\u2019d been taking care of him since birth, he was forcing himself to keep a distance from them.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cYou say that whenever I come back.\u201d\u201cOf course! I have to ask, since my son\u2019s goal is to become a swordsman!\u201dEven before hearing the answer, she started to check different parts of Raon\u2019s body. Ignoring him even when he said he was okay, she only released him once she confirmed he was alright.\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t hurt. I\u2019ll be going, then\u2026\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dSylvia shook her head and hugged Raon tightly.\u201cI stink of sweat.\u201dSince he\u2019d returned after training without washing his body, he was in terrible condition. But Sylvia didn\u2019t let him go.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stink at all, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt feels great to hug my son after such a long time. I can also tell how much you\u2019ve grown.\u201dShe let him go after hugging him for a long time. Her eyes shone happily, like a star.\u201cDid you eat already?\u201d\u201cOf course I did. It was before I came back.\u201d\u201cGood job with your training. You can go back and rest.\u201dSylvia murmured that she would have a sweet dream, having hugged her son after a long time, and went back to her room.When Raon was about to return to his room while shaking his head, he met Helen\u2019s eyes as she stood at the end of the hallway.\u201cYoung master, I\u2019ll fill up the bathtub. Please take a bath before resting.\u201dShe smiled before disappearing sideways like a ghost. He could hear her laughing along as her footsteps got further away.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dWhenever he was home, he was unable to control his ability nor his emotions. However, since he didn\u2019t dislike it, it was just awkward.Feeling even more tired than when he trained, he went back to his room.\u201cAh, I\u2019m so tired\u2026\u201dAs he was resting for a bit in his chair, a knocking sound could be heard, and the door opened soon after that.\u201cYoung master, the bathtub is ready.\u201dHe thought it was Helen, but it was Judiel who stuck her head in.\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dAs he was about to stand up after nodding, Judiel entered the room and closed the door.\u201cIt\u2019s about the Central Martial Palace.\u201d\u201cCentral Martial Palace?\u201dThe Central Martial Palace was Karoon Zieghart\u2019s castle, where Judiel was sent from.\u201cContinue.\u201dRaon sat back in his seat, his red eyes gleaming.\u201cYes.\u201dJudiel knelt in front of Raon and lowered her head. They looked like a king and his retainer.\u201cI\u2019ve received an order from the Central Martial Palace to grasp and report everything young master Raon does once he returns to the annex building.\u201d\u201cIt must mean that they are plotting something.\u201d\u201cThat seems to be the case.\u201d\u201c...Is it about the real battle?\u201dRaon murmured the words that Rimmer told him that day.\u201cBy real battle, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cInstructor Rimmer said there will be actual battle training next week. I think he will make his move there.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dJudiel suddenly lifted her head.\u201cNow that I think about it, trainees sometimes get to fight monsters during their actual battle training.\u201d\u201cI heard about that, too.\u201dHe remembered Dorian screaming that they would probably fight monsters at the end of the training that day.\u201cThen he probably took measures on the monster, or on the magician who will be handling the monster, or\u2026\u201dRaon closed his eyes and continued.\u201cIt might be both.\u201d***The next Monday, Jake went to the fifth training ground one hour earlier than the appointed time.\u2018I have to do well.\u2019In order to succeed in this damned place, connections were necessary.Until now, he\u2019d never even gotten the worst possible connections. But what was offered to him this time wasn\u2019t just a decent connection, but one strong enough to lead him to the heavens.For the sake of his future, he needed to inflict a serious injury to Raon no matter what. That was the only way to gain Karoon Zieghart\u2019s favor.\u2018I don\u2019t even need to worry about the aftermath.\u2019Raon Zieghart\u2019s background was almost non-existent, and Karoon was a man that could become the next head of house. It was already decided who he needed to act for.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dJake caught his breath and opened the door to the fifth training ground. He could see the trainees practicing their swordsmanship through the sandy dust.Since it wasn\u2019t the appointed time yet, he went to the outside border and watched the trainees.\u2018That boy is Burren, and the one next to him must be Martha.\u2019Jake recognized the important trainees that he needed to not mess with, using the descriptions that he\u2019d heard before.\u2018The one over there is Runaan, the youngest of house Sullion, and\u2026\u2019Finally, his gaze was directed at the golden-haired boy that was swinging his sword at the right side of the training ground.\u2018Is that boy Raon? He looks incredibly handsome.\u2019The way he was moving his feet and swinging his sword looked like a beautiful picture.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I have no choice. I won\u2019t kill you at least.\u2019Jake bit his lip and sent a small amount of killing intent towards Raon. It was weak pressure that he was unconsciously emitting, too small for even a perceptive swordsman or a wild animal to sense.However.One person reacted to it.Raon, who had been focused on his sword, directed his gaze towards Jake.\u201cEek!\u201dIn a fright, Jake bumped his back against the wall and collapsed. He felt his heart tightened the moment he saw Raon\u2019s red eyes.\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dAs if he was standing naked in front of a savage beast, he couldn\u2019t move a single finger.\u2018Wh-who is that guy\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to get up, but he couldn\u2019t move a single finger. When didn\u2019t know what to do, he heard frivolous footsteps.\u201cDid you come from the magic tower? Wow, you came so early.\u201dHis head, which was frozen stiff, moved towards a voice as light as the footsteps. There was a red-haired elf smiling at him.\u201cH-head instructor Rimmer?\u201d\u201cCorrect. Please come this way. I have things to tell you before training.\u201dRimmer tapped his arm and pointed towards the head instructor\u2019s room.\u201cHmm, okay.\u201dHe answered and turned his head back to where Raon was. The boy was swinging his sword as if he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dJake took a deep breath and stood up. If Rimmer was any later in coming up to him, he would have pissed his pants.\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d\u201cN-no. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dFollowing Rimmer, who nodded lightly, he entered the head instructor\u2019s room. Unlike his neat appearance, the room was so messy that there was nowhere to sit.\u201cPlease sit down.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s nowhere to sit\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s true.\u201dRimmer smiled lightly and stood from his rocking chair.\u201cWell, it won\u2019t take a long time, so let\u2019s just do it like this. Are you already aware that you need to use strengthening magic on the orc that will be facing the trainees?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cBecause of my excellent teachings, the trainees are stronger than they should be at their age. A normal orc won\u2019t be of any use for their training.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis head went blank to his sudden boasting.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how strong each of those children are, so please use the strengthening magic according to that. Is that possible?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a difficult thing to do since I\u2019m specialized in summoning and handling monsters.\u201d\u201cI guess, since the vice master of magic tower, Verbin has also complimented you\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWhen Rimmer talked about the vice master of magic tower, Jake\u2019s expression was strangely distorted.\u201cAnd one more thing, about the hallucination magic to make the monster look like a human\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that can be solved with this.\u201dJake lifted his right hand and showed him the ring on his middle finger.\u201cIt\u2019s a hallucination artifact given to me by the vice master. Casting hallucination magic on the trainees is a simple matter using this ring.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s perfect.\u201dRimmer whistled in satisfaction.\u201cThen please take care of it. Once everything ends well, I\u2019ll buy you and the vice master a drink.\u201dAfter saying that, he left the head instructor\u2019s room.\u2018My job\u2019s gotten easier.\u2019Since Rimmer entrusted him with everything about the monster, it wasn\u2019t going to be difficult to summon that orc to inflict a deadly injury to Raon. He could run away afterward while making excuses.\u201cThat guy\u2026\u201dJake recalled Raon, the boy he saw a moment ago. He was reluctant about injuring a boy he didn\u2019t even know at first, but he wasn\u2019t anymore.The damn brat that humiliated him had to be wounded even more seriously.Clench.Jake clenched his jaw and left the instructor\u2019s room.***Raon calmly watched the middle-aged magician head to the instructor\u2019s room behind Rimmer.Even though it was only for a split second, he could feel killing intent from that magician. Rather than killing, he wanted to harm him. It was something that anyone other than him wouldn\u2019t have been able to perceive.You are so hated at such a young age. What have you been doing with your life? Back in\u00a0devildom, every single devil worshiped the King of Essence\u2026\u2018Shut up.\u2019Raon used his feet to push Wrath, who was laughing at him, away.\u2018He must be the one.\u2019Karoon\u2019s dirty trick that Judiel mentioned seemed to be that magician.To be unable to hide his own pressure\u2026 He is worse than a kitten.\u2018At least a kitten is cute. A guy like him is completely useless.\u2019Raon swept his hair back, looking at the instructor\u2019s room.\u2018He will strengthen the monster.\u2019Following Karoon\u2019s order, the magician was certainly going to enhance the monster that was going to fight him to an abnormal degree.\u2018He will try to either kill me or inflict a serious injury.\u2019He could only laugh at how pathetic the plan was. His son was too good for him.\u2018Pathetic.\u2019When he turned around while clicking his tongue, he met Runaan\u2019s eyes as she entered the training ground. Her eyes, which he hadn\u2019t seen for the past two days, were the same as always. His chest tightened for some reason.\u201cDad told me today\u2019s training was about fighting monsters.\u201dShe started talking about the day\u2019s training, as if she didn\u2019t want to think about what happened back then.\u201cIs it?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan visibly nodded. She was obviously forcing herself to act like nothing happened, but he couldn\u2019t tell her anything since she seemed to want to forget about that matter.She went to the break room after telling him she was going to prepare for the training.Aren\u2019t you going to ask her about it?\u2018I don\u2019t know what to say. And it\u2019s her family\u2019s problem.\u2019He wasn\u2019t sure how he could give advice about her family when he didn\u2019t even know anything about his own emotions.However, he at least knew what Syria did to Runaan. He could solve that problem with the correct opportunity.\u201cY-young master. Did you know about it?\u201dAs he was bitterly licking his lips, Dorian approached him while restlessly rubbing his stomach.\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s actual battle training, i-it\u2019s not just about fighting a monster.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cApparently, we have to kill a monster! We have to shed blood for real! Wh-what do we do?\u201dBiting his fingernail, he rolled his eyes.\u201cBloodshed, huh\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes! Ending their life is the training\u2019s objective! It\u2019s really crazy!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cEeek!\u201dLeaving behind Dorian, who was screaming, he looked at the breakroom that had Runaan entered.Let\u2019s try breaking the curse.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cEveryone, attention!\u201dRimmer, who went to the instructor\u2019s room, was already standing on the platform. He clapped his hands to get everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cDo you remember that I told you to brace yourselves, since there would be actual battle training today?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees answered as they gathered in the center of the training ground. Their expressions were full of anticipation.\u201cIt looks like you are starting to trust me. Your eyes are glittering.\u201dThe trainees giggled at Rimmer\u2019s joke. It seemed they started to understand Rimmer\u2019s true intentions after spending so much time with him.\u201cAlthough you already know most of it with the hints and information spread by some instructors, I shall still explain. Today\u2019s training is an actual battle against monsters.\u201dHis voice, which had been completely mischievous until a moment ago, grew calm. The entire training ground\u2019s atmosphere became heavy.\u201cThere\u2019s no mercy in a monster\u2019s axe. Unlike a match between you, or with knight trainees, they will never stop. Don\u2019t be careless or nervous. Keep your usual composure when you face them.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dTrainees clenched their fists and shouted their heads off.\u201cThis is the magic tower\u2019s magician Jake, who will be helping us with training today. Give your greetings.\u201d\u201cI look forward to your kind cooperation!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m also looking forward to your cooperation.\u201dJake bowed in response and quickly sought out Roan with his eyes.\u2018It\u2019s fine now.\u2019The strange gaze that squeezed his heart earlier wasn\u2019t there anymore. They were normal eyes that he wouldn't have noticed if he met him in the street.\u2018However\u2026\u2019There was no way the pressure earlier was a mistake. Considering he was Karoon\u2019s target, there was something special with that boy.\u201cThen Sir Magician, please take care of it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJake nodded to Rimmer, who was waving his hand, and went to the front of the platform.\u201cSummon monster.\u201dWhen Jake hit the ground with his staff after the incantation, a magic circle was drawn on the training ground\u2019s floor. A green light burst out of the blue letters forming in a circle.Whoosh!The light disappeared slowly and an enormous humanoid shape appeared.Over two meters tall with robust muscles, protruding front teeth, and green skin\u2014it was an orc, the most common yet most dangerous monster.\u201cGrrr!\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThe orc ground his teeth while lifting his axe. The trainees swallowed, facing the wild bloodthirst and stench.\u201cSince it\u2019s still under my control, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dOnce Jake spun his finger, the orc turned in the same direction.\u201cThe monster you will be fighting today is this orc.\u201d\u201cI knew it was an orc!\u201d\u201cIs it finally time for a real battle\u2026\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dThe trainees looked up at Jake, expressions mixed between nervousness and excitement.\u201cJust as the instructor said, you shouldn\u2019t be careless because it\u2019s an orc. Since I can\u2019t stop it sometimes, you should always maintain your focus. And\u2026\u201dJake pointed at the orc with the ring on his right hand.Whir.The magic circle surrounding the orc was twisted like a vine and shone with five colors, then the orc\u2019s appearance started to change.The protruding front teeth went back into place and the green skin burned with white. It only took a few seconds until the orc became a plain, middle-aged man with brown hair holding an axe.\u201cA-a human?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this!\u201d\u201cWhy is there a human\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be fighting a normal orc, but an orc that has been transformed into a human through magic.\u201dJake moved the orc\u2019s axe and pointed it at the trainees.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s just a human!\u201dThe trainees were surprised at the sudden change and stared blankly at the orc that had become a human.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one more thing.\u201dRimmer walked up in front of Jake and raised his finger.\u201cThe fight today isn\u2019t about winning against the orc or neutralizing it. It will only end once you cut off its head.\u201dWith his raised finger, he pointed at the human-appearing orc.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe panicked trainees could only look at each other without being able to step up.\u201cMost of the orcs that were caught by magicians have already killed a human before. Since there\u2019s no need for mercy, do your best to fight and win.\u201dRimmer said in an unusually heavy voice, then stepped back.\u2018Dorian\u2019s information was accurate.\u2019Raon nodded.\u2018It\u2019s not bad training.\u2019Most swordsmen were unable to make the finishing blow in their first real battle.In fact, many unfortunate geniuses had died like that, unable to overcome their first actual fight despite having excellent abilities.In order to prevent that from happening, today\u2019s fight wasn\u2019t only about fighting a monster, but also about preparing them to fight humans in the future.\u2018And\u2026\u2019Raon looked at Runaan, who was sticking next to him. Her lips were trembling after hearing that she had to cut its head off.\u2018It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to break her curse.\u2019Rimmer was probably unaware of it, but it seemed he could undo Syria\u2019s brainwashing on Runaan thanks to this training.Are you not even paying attention to that scum magician?\u2018Of course.\u2019Raon nodded. The best thing he could do was strengthen some slightly ferocious orc that he got somewhere to try fighting him. It wasn\u2019t even worth being nervous about.Removing the engraved fear from Runaan\u2019s mind was more important right now.\u201cThen let\u2019s start right away. The first person to fight will be\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dBurren raised his hand before Jake even finished speaking.\u201cYou must know him, right? He is the son of Central Martial Palace\u2019s master. Please strengthen the orc a lot for him.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dJake licked his lips upon hearing Rimmer\u2019s explanation. Of course he knew about him, since he was the son of the person who gave him the task.\u201cLoop Agility, Loop Strength.\u201dOnce he uttered the incantation to increase the agility and strength, blue light fluttered around the orc and his yellow eyes became even more violent.\u201cGo.\u201dOnce Jake extended his finger forward, the orc stepped up with heavy footsteps.After clenching and opening his fist a few times, Burren unsheathed the real sword he had been supplied with. He nodded at Jake, signaling that he was ready.\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201dOnce Jake flicked his finger, the letters surrounding the orc disappeared.\u201cGrrr!\u201dThe orc kicked the off from the ground with a thunderous roar. Running like a beast, it slammed its axe down at Burren\u2019s head.\u201cI can see everything.\u201dBurren lifted his sword as he used his aura.Clash!As a rusty axe and well-polished sword collided against each other, red sparks appeared.\u201cKugh!\u201dBurren raised his eyes sharply. The hand that was holding the sword trembled, as if it were creaking.\u2018What is this weight\u2026?\u2019He\u2019d never seen nor fought against an orc, but he thought he could easily cut through him with how strong he currently was.However, the weight of the orc\u2019s axe wasn\u2019t something he could handle easily. It wasn\u2019t lacking in any way when compared to the knight trainee of the Owen Kingdom he\u2019d fought last time.\u201cHaa!\u201dPowerfully turning his wrist, he deflected the orc\u2019s axe.\u201cGrr!\u201dThe orc stepped back a couple times, then dashed back at him even faster. Its eyes glowed yellow, full of intent\u2014it wanted to tear Burren limb from limb.The trainees that were watching were surprised by the bloodlust, but Burren wasn\u2019t intimidated.\u201cHow dare you!\u201dInstead, he furiously slashed with his sword.Wham! Wham!When the orc pummeled down his axe as if it was facing the enemy of its life, Burren\u2019s sword pierced into its opening.Stab!Red blood spurt from the orc\u2019s shoulder and thigh.\u201cKuahhh!\u201dHowever, it kept coming at him with an even fiercer roar. It looked like a complete beast now.\u201cI\u2019ll end you!\u201dGetting under the orc, Burren slashed upwards.Clank!The moment he was about to cut the orc\u2019s head off after pushing back its axe, Burren\u2019s sword was turned to the right. Instead of its neck, it cut through more than half of the orc\u2019s forearm.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren bit his lip, unable to finish it off despite having the opportunity.\u201cKuah!\u201dOrc kept forcing its way into him like a bull, despite being seriously injured in its shoulder and forearm. It had become weaker, but its vigor remained the same.Woosh!Burren used his footwork to get to the orc\u2019s back as it slowed down. The moment he was about to cut off the orc\u2019s head by slashing horizontally, his sword stopped once again.\u201cDamn it!\u201dBurren stepped back while cursing. The tip of his sword was trembling, as if he was terrified.\u201cBurren.\u201dRimmer, who was watching the fight from the platform, raised himself.\u201cEven though you know that what\u2019s trying to kill you is a monster, and not a human, you still can\u2019t kill it, right?\u201dHis voice was peaceful, as if he already knew it would happen.\u201cIt\u2019s because you are good natured. Since you see that monster as a human, you can\u2019t move your sword properly. However\u2026\u201dRimmer continued, pointing at the orc grinding its teeth.\u201cLike I said before, that orc has already tasted human blood before. Most of the monsters that magicians possess have already killed humans before.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201dJake nodded, confirming what Rimmer said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be unable to kill it now, as this is just a practice. However, if your hand stops on the battlefield, the swordsman or monster that you were unable to kill will end up killing your ally instead.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dWhile deflecting the orc\u2019s axe, Burren listened to Rimmer\u2019s calm advice.\u201cAnd you can\u2019t stop now if you want to catch up to your target, can you?\u201dHearing that, Burren turned his head towards Raon. After meeting his red eyes, his sword was clad in a heavier aura than before.\u201cGrrrr!\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201dThe moment the orc\u2019s axe dropped vertically, Burren stretched his knees and pierced into its space.\u201cHaa!\u201dWith a shout of concentration, his sword drew a semicircle.Slash!As a red line was drawn into the sky, the orc\u2019s head fell and its body collapsed. As its life ended, its human appearance returned to its original orcish form.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dBurren gasped for breath, sticking his sword on the ground. However, he didn\u2019t look away. He kept watching the corpse he\u2019d created.\u201cGood job.\u201dRimmer smiled and Burren looked at him for a moment, then turned his head. It was the first time that their eyes met without frowning.\u201c......\u201dBurren took a glance at Raon for the last time, then returned to his place.Snap!When Jake snapped his fingers, the orc\u2019s corpse disappeared. However, the blood covering the training ground\u2019s floor still remained.\u201cWell then, next is\u2026\u201d\u201cMe!\u201dMartha stood up, confidently raising her hand. There was no hesitation in her footsteps as she walked up to the orc.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon looked away from Martha's confident back and looked at Runaan.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dContrary to Martha, Runaan\u2019s lips were trembling as she looked at the blood-soaked floor. Her face looked as white as a sheet.Raon\u2019s eyes grew gloomy. Runaan had been avoiding shedding blood as much as she could.When she sparred against other trainees, or the knight trainee, she\u2019d only suppressed them without actually injuring them.He didn\u2019t really think anything of it back then, but now that he looked back at it, it seemed she\u2019d decided to fight like that because she was afraid of blood.\u2018So, it was the blood.\u2019Syria Sullion carved fear into her while showing her blood. Crushing the squirrel must\u2019ve been to remind her of that trauma.Frightening coldness covered Raon\u2019s red eyes.\u2018Syria Sullion.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll break the curse you\u2019ve cast on Runaan.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was bigger and looked even more violent than the one that fought Burren.\u201cLoop strength, loop agility\u2026\u201dUsing a bit more mana than with Burren, Jake increased the orc\u2019s strength and agility, then released its control.\u201cKuaahh!\u201dThe orc roared and pounced on her like a bull.\u201cA mere monster!\u201dMartha clenched her teeth and kicked off from the ground. She struck with her sword, aiming at the orc coming at her.\u201cKuooo!\u201dThe orc also swung its greatsword at a comparable speed.Slam! Slaam!Along with the thunderous noise of a boulder being split apart, the swords crashed countless times.\u201cKuaaah!\u201dFully utilizing Titan\u2019s aura, Martha twisted.\u201cGrr!\u2019Deflecting the orc\u2019s greatsword with the steel on her shoulder, she sliced with her sword.Hack!A definite strike! Martha\u2019s sword seized the opening and cut off the orc\u2019s head in one fell swoop.\u201cHaa.\u201dAfter glaring at the orc\u2019s corpse collapsed on the ground, Martha straightened her back and breathed out.\u201cDid it really take you the whole day to kill something like that? Don\u2019t tell anyone you are from the same place as me. You\u2019re too low.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dBurren shut his mouth as he listened to the words Martha let fall as she went back. He couldn\u2019t say anything after seeing the way she broke through the orc with her strength and ended its life in an instant.\u201cMartha.\u201dRaon called out to Martha as she walked to the back.\u201cGo get your shoulder treated after training. There might be aftereffects.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha pouted and turned her head. He did give his share of advice as the top trainee, so the rest was up to her. Raon also turned his head.Snap!The orc\u2019s corpse disappeared at Jake\u2019s gesture, but the red pool of blood was seeping into the ground and the stench spread throughout the training ground.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRunaan\u2019s trembling was getting worse and worse. Her pink lips were turning completely pale.Why aren\u2019t you doing anything if you are going to break her curse?\u2018Because it\u2019s not the right time.\u2019In order to heal a deep scar, it was necessary to let it fester until it rotted. Only then could the scar be completely removed.Raon tapped his finger, watching Jake summon the third orc.It wasn\u2019t the right time to pop the bloated blister yet.***The fight to death between trainees and monsters continued.Thanks to Burren and Martha\u2019s great opening, the trainees didn\u2019t run away despite being nervous.It took a while for some of them, but they all managed to finish off their orc after aiming for its head, heart, or through a desperate fight.Raon watched the arena as the sun began to set. Dorian was using his footwork while screaming.\u201cKuaaah!\u201dThe orc followed him with a horrible roar, but it couldn\u2019t catch Dorian because his feet were simply too fast.\u201cHaa!\u201dShouting that he was scared, Dorian swung his sword. The orc\u2019s back was cut instead of its neck.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cUaaah!\u201dDorian was even more surprised than the injured orc and started running away. The orc was infuriated and pounced at him with a dreadful shriek.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cWh-when is it ending?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already been thirty minutes. Thirty minutes!\u201d\u201cHis stamina and speed are great, at least.\u201cThere\u2019s only Raon and Runaan left. They will finish even faster.\u201dThe trainees sighed and watched the chase between Dorian and the orc.Raon licked his lips while watching Dorian\u2019s feet.\u2018If only he had a bit more guts\u2026\u2019Dorian was nimble on his feet and his sword technique was sharp, but he was too cowardly. If only he could fix his scaredy cat nature, he could be ranked right after Martha, Runaan, and Burren.Rustle.He turned around at the sand\u2019s crumbling sound. Runaan was grasping the sand tightly, to the point that her fingernails were bleeding.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHer face was completely pale, her lips were covered in bruises after being bitten countless times, and her hands and feet were trembling as if there was an earthquake.It was a typical appearance of a person who wasn\u2019t simply scared, but completely terrified.Rimmer, who was on the platform, furrowed his brows and looked at Runaan. He must\u2019ve been wondering whether he should send her back.\u2018That won\u2019t do.\u2019After all, it was the best moment to pop the blister that had completely matured.Raon stood up and went next to Runaan, making her shivering ease slightly.\u201cYou must be scared.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRunaan didn\u2019t turn around or respond.\u201cBlood is scary for everyone. A trainee who\u2019s using the sword for the first time, and an experienced swordsman who has gone through hundreds of battlefields, must feel the same way about that.\u201dRunaan\u2019s chin turned slightly.\u201cSame goes for me. Dorian, who is fighting right now, and those who\u2019ve fought before are all scared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dRunaan spoke with a dried-out voice.\u201cYes. However, do you know what\u2019s even more scary than that?\u2019She slowly shook her head.\u201cBeing too terrified to do anything.\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes glowed viciously. The nature of assassin Raon, rather than Raon Zieghart, was leaking from him.\u201cIf I just stand still because I\u2019m too scared or afraid, nothing will change. Nothing will be solved like that.\u201dHe was actually afraid.He was afraid that his desire for revenge against Derus Robert would subside because he was satisfied with his current life.He was also afraid that his revenge, his actions, would bring undesirable consequences on Sylvia and the maids in the annex building.He was scared and afraid, but he didn\u2019t intend to give up on any of them.He was going to take his revenge against Derus no matter what, and find a way for Sylvia and maids to live on happily.Resolving himself once again, Raon turned around to Runaan.\u201cYou must also have something like that.\u201dRaon chewed his thumb to create a wound.Tap.As the red blood gathered on his thumb fell on the ground, Runaan stepped back and her teeth chattered.\u201cAah\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t run away. You won\u2019t be able to overcome it if you don\u2019t do it now.\u201d\u201cR-Raon. Raon!\u201d\u201cBlood is scary. However.\u201dRaon approached Runaan and grabbed her hand. She had stepped back to the point that she was almost lying down. The blood flowing out of his finger colored her white hand in red.\u201cIt\u2019s also nothing special. The blood won\u2019t harm you in any way.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dRunaan\u2019s eyes widened, seeing the drops of blood flowing down from her hand. She looked flustered, realizing that the blood wasn\u2019t hurtful, saddening, or heavy.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what your older brother did to you. However, the more you are afraid, the more his shadow will be cast over you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe trembling on Runaan\u2019s hand started to visibly subside.\u201cIf you keep running away because you are scared, you will have no choice but to be dragged around for your entire life. Runaan Sullion, you are the one who can protect yourself and your family.\u201dThat was Raon\u2019s heartfelt advice. Runaan looked like the Raon from his previous life, when he was dragged around by Derus Robert.\u201cArgggh! I thought I was going to die!\u201dDorian, who returned after barely managing to cut the orc\u2019s head off, sank to his knees.\u201cIt was really difficult. I almost died. Sniff!\u201dHe murmured while wiping his tears away with his sleeve.\u201cDo you have a squirrel?\u201dRaon looked at Dorian while standing up.\u201cA squirrel? Even I don't have everything. Wait, I have one.\u201dMurmuring \u2018why do I have this?\u2019, Dorian took out the wooden squirrel sculpture from his belly pocket. It was a cute squirrel with impressive red eyes.\u201cTake this.\u201dHe gave the squirrel that Dorian gave him to Runaan. She accepted the squirrel with trembling hands.\u201cThat\u2019s it for my advice. I\u2019ll tell you the rest with my sword.\u201dAfter saying that, Raon walked towards the arena.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *It\u2019s so unusual for you to step up.Wrath sneered, murmuring that he didn\u2019t even know his place.\u2018You can think like that.\u2019Raon nodded. It was just like Wrath said. It was unusual for him to step up like that.It was because she was the first stranger in his life that was considerate towards him, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason.She reminded him of his previous life.Because she looked similar to himself in his previous life, where he\u2019d been brainwashed by Derus Robert, he unconsciously spoke and acted.\u2018This is the last time.\u2019He already finished explaining with words, and he was about to show her with his sword. If she couldn\u2019t free herself from the brainwashing of that blood despite all that, then that was her limit.You idiot. Worry about yourself first. It\u2019s pretty obvious you will struggle just like the other worms.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Listening to Wrath, he had a great idea.\u2018Then shall we make a bet?\u2019Bet?\u2018Yes, and it will be very advantageous for you.\u2019What is it?\u2018If I can\u2019t cut down the orc in a single strike, I\u2019ll take your wrath. A single strike.\u2019A single strike? Are you serious?\u2018Of course.\u2019After giving some advice you read in a book, you are now looking down on killing.Wrath giggled and vibrated the bracelet.Alright, it\u2019s a single strike. Two strikes and it will be your loss.The message appeared as he stopped laughing.[\u2018Wrath\u2019 proposes the third bet.]Condition: Cut off the strengthened orc\u2019s neck in a single strike.Upon Success: All stats +2, a random trait.Upon Failure: Creation of 10 points of 'Wrath'.\u2018I accept.\u2019He expected Wrath to take this bet, since he didn\u2019t know he was an assassin in his previous life.\u2018The doormat is here once again.\u2019Secretly smiling about Wrath, Raon went to the arena.\u201cOh, you aren\u2019t the last person this time.\u201dRimmer whistled. His eyes were wavering like he was having fun. He must\u2019ve heard everything he told Runaan.\u201cHe is the strongest one here. Please take out the strongest orc you have.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dJake firmly shut his mouth. Nodding with a determined expression, he chanted the spell.Whir!Along with an outbreak of a blue magic circle on the floor, a new orc appeared. Its shape was similar to the other orcs, but its muscles were more distinct, with its body was full of scars.\u201cGrr!\u201dAlthough it was unable to move its body due to the magic circle, it was still expressing its ferocious instinct.Whir!Green, red, and blue magic circles covered the orc\u2019s upper body, and its pressure increased exponentially.Zzzt!When Jake extended his hand, the orc\u2019s appearance changed into a rough man.\u201cBe ready for the match.\u201dRaon nodded. He was about to warm up his right wrist after lightly spinning his left wrist.Clank!Jake\u2019s magic circle broke like glass, and the orc broke out.\u201cGrrrrr!\u201dRushing while screeching, it struck down with its bloodstained ax. Its power and speed were on a completely different level from the other orcs.\u201cWh-what!\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201dEveryone panicked, but Raon\u2019s eyes were even calmer.\u2018It\u2019s because I knew about it all along.\u2019He\u2019d expected this would happen the moment he saw Jake\u2019s excited eyes.Rustle.Raon unsheathed his sword from his waist. One flower blossomed on top of the blade. The golden flower shimmered like a haze upon receiving the evening glow.The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, First Flame.Flame Spirit.The flower petals fluttered and cut through the ground.Under the evening glow, another evening glow was drawn, and the orc\u2019s movement stopped.\u201cGrr\u2026\u201dWithout being able to swing his lifted axe, its head fell to the ground.Thud!Red blood gushed out under the overlapping evening glows, and the orc\u2019s heavy body collapsed.Cruelly beautiful, it was a spectacle that would make the best painter in the continent snap their brush.The instructors that were running towards them to stop the orc, the trainees that stood up in surprise, and even Jake\u2014who was controlling the orc\u2014were at a loss for words.Using the expertise from his previous life, he suppressed Jake. Facing an assassin\u2019s pressure, one whose life was all about killing people, Jake grabbed his neck and sank to his knees.\u201cGrr.\u201dHis eyes turned inside out. He wanted to continue, but Runaan\u2019s turn was after his. After threatening him moderately, he removed his pressure.Whish.Shaking off the blood from his sword, he turned around.\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dBurren ground his teeth so hard that the sound could be heard, and Martha twisted her lips with furrowed brows. They both looked extremely frustrated.\u201cUuh.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe trainees\u2019 mouths were so wide open that bugs could go inside. They were trembling violently, as if they were hit by a sea wave.\u201cC-crazy.\u201d\u201cWhat technique was that?\u201d\u201cA-a single strike\u2026\u201dThe instructors were standing dumbfounded.After taking a glance at everyone, he looked at Runaan, who was at the very back.Her eyes were no longer soaked in darkness. He nodded to her.\u2018It\u2019s your turn now.\u2019***Watching Raon, who went into the arena, Runaan hugged the squirrel sculpture.\u2018Does he know everything?\u2019She purposefully avoided talking about it to avoid harming Raon. She relaxed her eyes, pretending it was nothing. It turned out alright, she thought that was the end of the matter.However, he talked to her like he knew everything.Raon\u2019s calm voice felt like it slowly untied the hand that was squeezing her heart.When he extended his bleeding hand, she was scared. She wanted to run away immediately.\u2018However\u2026\u2019When she grabbed that hand, even though her hand was soaked in that blood, she wasn\u2019t scared or afraid. It simply felt warm, like a small fire.That was when she finally realized. The blood itself wasn\u2019t scary. It felt like the black shadow tying up her heart had become more sparse.Runaan looked at Raon, who stood in the arena with a calm breath. His back was small, but for some reason it looked wider than anyone else.Whir!While she was nervously watching that back, the orc\u2019s magic circle suddenly disappeared.\u201cKuaa!\u201dThe orc pounced at Raon with a fierce roar.\u201cN-no!\u201dThe moment she stood up with a trembling chin, Raon unsheathed his sword.A golden flower blossomed on top of the silver blade. A beautifully radiating flower drew a line, following the evening glow.The moment the two evening glows overlapped with each other, blood gushed from the orc\u2019s neck like a fountain.Beautiful.The blood she\u2019d been scared and afraid of since childhood, the drops of blood that shouldn\u2019t have ever looked like that, beautifully embroidered the space.Raon shook off his sword and turned around. His eyes spoke to her.\u2018It\u2019s your turn now.\u2019\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan stood up. Her hands were no longer trembling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please take out the strongest orc you have.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dJake nodded, lowering his lips.\u2018That\u2019s a relief.\u2019Since he\u2019d actually asked him to get the strongest orc, it became easier for him to use the magic he\u2019d prepared. Holding back his laughter with difficulty, he chanted the spell.\u201cSummon Monster.\u201dJake lifted his hand and summoned the orc from the Dollan mountains that he\u2019d received from Karoon.Thud!The ground trembled as the biggest orc so far burst from the magic circle.The teeth protruding from its mouth reached its earlobes, its inflated muscles were full of vitality, and its eyes were ferocious enough to eat humans alive.\u201cGrrr!\u201dThe trainees grew pale hearing the orc\u2019s roar.\u201cOh, that orc looks pretty strong.\u201dWithout realizing anything, Rimmer nodded in satisfaction.\u201cThen I\u2019ll strengthen it with magic.\u201d\u201cAh, sure.\u201d\u201cStrength, Endurance.\u201dWhile using spells to strengthen its physical abilities, he also engraved the berserker magic that he\u2019d prepared in its body.Berserker magic could multiply the target\u2019s physical abilities by over 1.5 times the norm. Moreover, the orc was from the Dollan mountains, which meant it wasn\u2019t at a level a mere trainee could fight against.Considering its ferocity, it was at least going to cut off one of Raon\u2019s arms before the instructors could interfere.Jake extended his wrist to make the orc look like a human, then nodded.\u201cPlease be ready for the match.\u201dAfter Raon nodded and started to warm up, Jake activated the berserker magic he\u2019d engraved in the orc.\u201cGrrrr!\u201dAs the berserker magic activated, its muscles swelled up and the magic circle that was confining it broke apart.\u201cGrrrr!\u201dNaturally, the orc pounced at Raon\u2014who was closest to him\u2014with a horrible shriek.Thump!The orc kicked off from the ground and dashed at him. It had an extremely murderous intent, and it was aiming to kill Raon in one fell swoop.\u2018I did it!\u2019Raon hadn\u2019t even unsheathed his sword yet. Overwhelmed by the orc\u2019s murderous intent, he was certainly going to lose an arm, at least.Jake was exhilarated as he watched the orc strike down at Raon.Rage!A red line\u2014no, golden after taking on the evening glow\u2014cut through the dim space.\u201cGrr\u2026\u201dThe orc\u2019s body stiffened, and its head fell to the ground.\u201cWh-what?!\u201dWhat happened?!It was an orc from Dollan Mountains, and a berserker spell that multiplied all its abilities by 1.5 times had been cast on it.And Raon cut down such a monster in a single strike. There was no hesitation, fear, or naivety in his action. It was a perfect strike, as if he was already an accomplished swordsman.Despite the situation, he even thought it was beautiful.Over the orc\u2019s collapsing body, he met Raon Zieghart\u2019s eyes. His heart dropped, facing the two burning red eyes.\u201cUgh!\u201dHe unconsciously fell back and grabbed his neck. He couldn\u2019t breathe because of the young trainee\u2019s pressure. It felt like his lungs had disappeared from his body.\u2018M-monster\u2026\u2019He started to back away while on his knees. Just as he was about to piss his pants, the frightening murderous intent finally abated.\u201cAah\u2026\u201dAlthough the murderous intent had stopped, the fear still remained. As Jake was trembling, Rimmer came up next to him.\u201cSir Magician looks very tired. I guess you did summon a lot of monsters today.\u201dRimmer grinned and lifted him up.\u201cBut there\u2019s still one person remaining. Since she is fully motivated, please work one more time.\u201dRimmer\u2019s finger pointed at Runaan, who was standing in the arena.\u201cI-I-I see.\u201dJake nodded, while shivering. He felt like he could do anything if it meant if he wasn\u2019t going to be glared at by Raon Zieghart.Catching his breath, he prepared for the last summoning.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cRunaan, are you okay? Can you do it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRunaan visibly nodded to Rimmer\u2019s question and entered the arena.The floor was soaked with blood, but her eyes weren\u2019t trembling anymore. Her purple eyes were looking straight ahead, with no sign of fear.\u201cPlease make your preparations.\u201d\u201cU-understood.\u201dJake lifted his trembling hand and summoned an orc. It looked like he wasn\u2019t an intermediate magician for nothing, as he properly cast the strengthening magic despite his terrified state.\u201cThen let\u2019s s-start.\u201dAfter using the hallucination to make the orc look like a human, he released the magic circle that was restraining the orc.\u201cGrrr!\u201dAt the same time as the orc started dashing, Runaan unsheathed her sword.Clank!Along with a thin blue pressure, the air was filled with a silver haze.\u201cGrrrr!\u201dThe skin-freezing frost spread around, but it couldn\u2019t stop the orc. It pounced at her while covered in frost.\u201cHmm.\u201dRunaan pouted a little and used her footwork. Moving as if she was gliding left and right, she dodged the orc\u2019s axe.\u201cKiaaa!\u201dThe orc didn\u2019t step back despite its frozen skin. It kept swinging its axe, determined to kill her at the cost of its own life.\u201cHmm.\u201dUnable to find an opportunity to swing her sword, Runaan kept dodging the axe. In the meantime, the frost spreading from her continued and the orc was already half frozen.\u201cTsk.\u201dRaon clicked his tongue, watching Runaan spread frost while stepping back, as if she was running away.\u2018Is it still not solved?\u2019Runaan didn\u2019t manage to swing her sword once after entering the arena. She was just freezing the orc while running away.\u2018She\u2019s too kind.\u2019The reason she was brainwashed by Syria was simple.Because she was kind.Because she learned about death at an early age, she was afraid of blood, unable to injure the orc.She was completely different from the Raon in his previous life, who would kill anyone in order to survive.Because of her cold appearance and gaze, Runaan was easily misunderstood as haughty. However, her personality was actually the complete opposite.\u2018Her sword tells it all.\u2019The reason she didn\u2019t include coldness in her blade during the spar and spread frost in the air instead was in order to suppress the opponent without hurting them.Runaan was the most gentle and kind person in the fifth training ground. And Syria had been using such a kind child by chaining her heart.\u2018Runaan.\u2019Now that he thought about it, the reason Runaan approached him first in the gymnasium wasn\u2019t to copy his training method, but probably because she felt pity for him, who was always alone.\u201cLady Runaan!\u201d\u201cJust cut it down!\u201d\u201cRunaan!\u201dThe instructors and trainees shouted Runaan\u2019s name, but she just kept running around while blocking the orc\u2019s attacks without being able to turn on the offense.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRunaan\u2019s movement slowed down, probably because she used too much aura from spreading the frost. On the other hand, the orc kept swinging its axe with a more ferocious gaze, despite most of its body being frozen.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon licked his lips and stood up. She couldn\u2019t just freeze the orc to death like that. She needed to put an end to it in order to be released from Syria\u2019s brainwashing.\u201cRunaan!\u201dRunaan, who hadn\u2019t reacted to anyone, turned her head for the first time.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAs he smiled, telling her that everything would be fine, the trembling in Runaan\u2019s gaze stopped. The purple eyes shone in a dark silver glow, like a snowfield that nobody\u2019s stepped on.Raon could feel the darkness in her eyes scatter like dust.\u201cKieee!\u201dThe moment the orc struck down its axe at Runaan\u2019s immobile head, a silvery trajectory burst into the air.Crack!The blade, shining in silver, split the head of the ax in half and pierced through the orc\u2019s heart.\u201cGuaa\u2026\u201dThe orc\u2019s eyes, filled with insanity, faded away like a candlelight as it fell onto its back.Spurt!Warm blood gushed from the orc\u2019s heart, which wasn\u2019t frozen yet. Although Runaan\u2019s hand was soaked in the orc\u2019s blood, her expression remained calm.She turned around to look at Raon. She nodded, as if she was asking him how it was, so he nodded her back.She got out.\u2018Indeed.\u2019Raon snickered. There was no fear in Runaan\u2019s expression anymore.Instead, she was displaying a refreshing smile.Although she was going to need a bit more time, Syria's darkness was clearly removed. His brainwashing couldn\u2019t affect Runaan anymore.\u2018I know that better than anyone.\u2019Since he\u2019d spent most of his previous life being brainwashed, he knew that for sure.\u201cWoaah\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-what was that?\u201d\u201cWhat did Raon tell her for her to change like that all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cS-scary.\u201dThe trainees dropped their jaws because of Runaan\u2019s ability to freeze the orc in a single strike, and the fact that it was Raon that made her do that.Even Burren and Martha looked surprised as they looked at him.\u201cJ-just what did you tell her?\u201dDorian approached him with wide eyes.\u201cIt was nothing special.\u201dRaon smirked and shook his head.\u201cShe did it on her own.\u201dGiving him a reasonable answer, Raon looked up at the platform. Jake, who met his eyes, gasped and stepped back.\u2018Well, then.\u2019It was time to engrave fear into that guy, so that he wouldn\u2019t dare oppose him ever again.As he was about to send a thin and sharp pressure up to the platform, Rimmer interfered.\u201cYou don\u2019t look well. Let\u2019s end it here.\u201dRimmer grinned and raised Jake up.\u201cTsk.\u201dRaon clicked his tongue and dispersed his murderous intent.\u2018But I\u2019m not done yet.\u2019He couldn\u2019t engrave fear into Jake. He wasn\u2019t going to dare come at him again or think of doing anything stupid, but he wanted to see him piss his pants.\u201cGood job everyone.\u201dRimmer grinned as he supported Jake.\u201cIt was honestly difficult training, yet everyone did better than I expected.\u201dHe raised his thumb at everyone.\u201cToday\u2019s experience is going to help you greatly during a real battle. Don\u2019t hesitate once the fight starts. Your hesitation will result in an ally\u2019s death. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees answered loud and clear, straightening their spines.\u201cThat\u2019s a good sound. It looks like you are really ready for a mission.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cM-mission?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe children\u2019s expressions brightened upon hearing the word mission.\u201cYes. We should start preparing slowly. Today\u2019s training ends now. To wrap it up, give a round of applause to the magician Jake, who worked hard today!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dHearing the trainees clap, he left the training ground with Jake.***\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dJake left the fifth training ground, supported by Rimmer. He wanted to move on his own, but his strength left his limbs because of the shock from Raon\u2019s murderous intent.\u201cYou must\u2019ve overworked yourself.\u201dRimmer gently supported him, as if he didn\u2019t know anything, and brought him to the magic tower.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe came back to his senses a little bit after enjoying the cool breeze for a while.\u201cI-I\u2019m fine now. I\u2019ll go on my own from here.\u201dJake stopped around the third training ground, where the combat unit trained. He had to go to the Central Martial Palace to report his failure.\u201cOh, I see.\u201dRimmer nodded and made him sit on the chair next to him.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201dJake bowed at Rimmer while sitting. And once he lifted his head, he realized something had changed.The wind that was blowing strongly enough to flutter the clothes couldn\u2019t be felt anymore. The wind had literally disappeared.And terrible murderous intent that gave him goosebumps was emanating from in front of him.He didn\u2019t want to look. However, a strange force made him lift his head.And he was there.The monster that was said to explode his madness next to Glenn Zieghart a few dozen years ago. Zieghart\u2019s Sword of Light was looking down at him with yellow eyes.\u201cAh, ah\u2026\u201dHis throat tightened and his nose started bleeding. He couldn\u2019t move a single finger.\u2018I-I heard he broke down\u2026\u2019He heard that Zieghart\u2019s Sword of Light had become disabled because of his energy center breaking. However, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. The monster might have gotten weaker, but it didn\u2019t disappear.\u201cGo and tell him.\u201dHis teeth clattered at Rimmer\u2019s cold voice.\u201cThe lord\u2019s son or whatnot. Tell him that if you touch my students, then I\u2019ll cut your head off.\u201dAlthough there was no wind at all, the blood gushed out of his chin and the skin on his arm was cracked. The murderous intent was singlehandedly slicing his body.\u201cArrgh!\u201dThe man knew everything. Despite knowing everything, he was just watching how far he went.\u201cA-ah\u2026\u201dHe felt like his heart had stopped. The fear made him unable to do anything.Bang!A dark green wind burst out from the ground Rimmer was standing on.\u201cHuff!\u201dJake closed his eyes, facing the powerful wind, and thought it was over. However, he felt no pain.When he opened his eyes to the wind blowing once again, Rimmer was nowhere to be seen. However, the murderous intent he\u2019d left behind remained in the air.\u201cEek! The teacher and the student are both monsters, fucking monsters\u2026\u201dJake knelt with liquid flowing from his eyes, nose, and mouth. His eyes kept shivering like an insane person.\u201cUaaah!\u201dDespite Raon\u2019s regret, fear was deeply engraved in Jake\u2019s soul.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her hand wouldn\u2019t move, despite knowing that it was a monster, not a human.\u2018I thought I was going to throw up.\u2019Each time she stepped on the blood beneath her feet she felt nauseous, and her limbs trembled as if she was looking at her brother.Unable to attack it directly, all she could do was to keep emitting frost, despite its high aura consumption.She knew people were shouting and yelling, but she couldn\u2019t hear any of that.Her vision was gradually filled with darkness. As her vision went dark on top of her hearing, she didn\u2019t know what to do, and remaining standing was all she could manage. It was at that moment that she heard him.\" Runaan ! \"Raon\u2019s clear voice pierced through the darkness filling her surroundings.Even though the orc was running at her, she turned to look at Raon.The moment she met Raon\u2019s smiling eyes, her turbulent emotions and senses calmed, as if nothing had happened from the beginning.Hearing him say it was okay made the darkness filling her vision completely dissipate. The memory of her older brother that was filling her head also became blurry.Yes, it was alright. When she murmured that, her heavy arm started to move freely.The moment the orc was about to strike down with its axe, she thrust the compressed energy.She could hear the head of the ax being cut apart and the orc\u2019s heart bursting, but she wasn\u2019t afraid anymore.The blood gushed out from the orc and covered her hand. It was just like Raon had said. Nothing was happening despite touching the blood.Clank!The moment she realized that, she could hear the sound of the thick chains coiling her entire body shattering.Her brother\u2019s face, reflected on the blood and shadows, also disappeared completely. It felt like the dark world was once again filled with light.\u201cDismantle the arena\u2019s floor and move it to the right warehouse! Be careful since we gotta use it again next time! Ah, where did that bastard instructor go without cleaning up?\u201dShe raised her head at Burren\u2019s voice in front of her. He was ordering the collaterals to clear up the training ground.\u2018He\u2019s changed.\u2019She\u2019d met Burren often since childhood. He\u2019d always been selfish and arrogant, so she\u2019d never cared about him. And yet, there was no trace of arrogance left in him anymore.And the one who had achieved that change wasn\u2019t Burren himself, but Raon. He\u2019d become such a proper swordsman after his defeat against Raon.\u2018The same goes for me.\u2019Thanks to meeting Raon, she could open her locked mind and build relationships with others.Every day was fun, and today was the peak of that change.Thanks to Raon\u2019s advice and reassurance that everything would be okay, she couldn\u2019t hear her brother\u2019s voice anymore, nor see his shadow.She felt free, as if something engraved in her head had been removed.Runaan nodded, looking at Raon.\u2018I should tell him thank you, that I\u2019m really grateful.\u2019It was time to express her gratitude, just like her mother had told her.***Inside the Central Martial Palace sunk into darkness, Jake\u2014wearing a robe torn to pieces\u2014knelt.\u201cI-I have failed.\u201dWith a trembling voice, he lowered his head.\u201cYou failed? Did Rimmer interfere?\u201dKaroon frowned, and looked down upon Jake, who was on his knees.\u201cN-no.\u201dJake didn\u2019t look normal. His eyes were cloudy, as if he were out of himself, and he was drooling as he was unable to put any strength in his chin.\u201cThen how did you even fail?\u201d\u201cR-Raon Zieghart killed the orc in a single strike, although berserker magic and all kinds of strengthening magics were used on it.\u201d\u201cBe careful about what you say. Are you expecting me to believe that?\u201dKaroon growled like a beast.\u201cIt\u2019s true! The flame ignited from his sword and cut through the orc\u2019s neck like nothing!\u201d\u201cFlame?\u201d\u201cYes! The orc was killed, unable to do anything when facing that golden flame under the evening glow. Moreover\u2026\u201dThinking that he needed to do anything in order to survive this situation, Jake told him everything that he saw in the fifth training ground.\u201cRimmer was already aware of our objective. U-upon seeing me off, he threatened to kill me if I dared to touch the trainees again.\u201dSince Karoon seemed interested, he even told him about the warning from Rimmer.\u201cI knew it was because of him.\u201dKaroon snorted and smirked.\u2018I guess a diamond on a dunghill is still a diamond.\u2019When he last met Rimmer, the balance between his body and mind was broken. Since he was a self-centered and lazy guy, he thought he wasn\u2019t going to realize his dirty trick. Apparently, he wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201cI-is it going to be okay? Rimmer even mentioned the palace master\u2019s name\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, since anything that bug does will be pointless.\u201dKaroon shook his head. Maybe he could\u2019ve done something in the past, but Rimmer as he was at the moment was like a weed that couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201cGo back. I\u2019ll call you again later.\u201d\u201cU-understood. Excuse me.\u201dJake left the room after bowing his head repeatedly.\u201cIf he cut through the orc and its weapon in a single strike, it wouldn\u2019t be strange to assume that he\u2019s acquired an advanced cultivation technique.\u201d\u201cThe spy\u2019s information did mention that he produced an extremely powerful wave of mana.\u201d\u201cBy spy, do you mean the one in the annex building?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty decent.\u201d\u201cAll the information she\u2019s brought so far was correct.\u201dKaroon closed his eyes and answered.\u201cIncrease her support a little bit and tell her to also investigate Rimmer's actions. And\u2026\u201dLooking at the door where Jake left, Karoon drew a line on his neck with his finger.\u201cTake care of him. He is too quick-witted to shut his mouth, and he\u2019s already been swallowed by Rimmer\u2019s murderous intent.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe butler nodded and disappeared from the spot like smoke.\u201cRaon Zieghart and Rimmer.\u201dThey were like dust that didn\u2019t need any attention considering his position, but somehow, they kept bothering him.\u201cI\u2019d better deal with them at once.\u201dThe Central Martial Palace\u2019s atmosphere grew heavy with Karoon\u2019s frightening gaze.***Martha leaned her back against a tree located at the training ground\u2019s outskirts. At the end of her gaze, Raon was cleaning up the training ground.\u201cTsk.\u201dShe clicked her tongue and frowned. She couldn\u2019t understand, no matter how hard she thought about it.\u2018What the hell is he?\u2019How could he swing his sword without any hesitation?She\u2019d clenched her fist. Learning that today\u2019s training was about killing a monster, and one that looked like a human on top of that\u2026She thought she could finally do better than Raon Zieghart.As expected, Burren and other trainees couldn\u2019t properly swing their swords at the monster. They only managed to kill it after receiving help from Instructor Rimmer.However, Martha was different.The moment the monster showed an opening, she thrust her sword into the monster\u2019s neck without any hesitation.It was natural that she was different from the others.\u2018Because I\u2019ve already done it before.\u2019Before she came to the Zieghart.When she infiltrated the White Blood Religion alone in order to find her mother, she had stabbed her sword into the believers.Since she had that experience, it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to strike her sword at the monster, despite it looking like a human.\u2018But how did he\u2026?\u2019Raon was different from her.He was born inside a safe wall, and he was safely raised because of his bad constitution. He was a sheltered young master.A guy who grew up sheltered had sliced an orc\u2019s throat, despite it looking like a human, without any hesitation. Moreover, he did it faster and stronger than her.It even looked so beautiful that she had spaced out for a moment.\u2018I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019She was still unsure if what she saw back then was real.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dMartha punched the tree that she was leaning against.\u2018I should\u2019ve won this.\u2019She lost to Raon in the spar and agreed to follow his orders, but her heart didn\u2019t give in.She kept training with everything she had in order to make him kneel one day. The thought of having lost again in something she should\u2019ve won for sure made her grind her teeth.However, a small wave reverberated in her mind in the midst of all that.It was the feeling of identity, a feeling that Raon might be similar to her.It looked like Raon wasn\u2019t just the sheltered boy that she\u2019d thought he was. There must\u2019ve been a trigger for his resolve.\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen she was thinking about Raon\u2019s past, she met his eyes.\u201cHmph.\u201dAfter looking at his calm eyes for a bit, she snorted and turned around. She left the training ground right after that.Her stiff footsteps had softened a little, but she wasn\u2019t aware of that fact.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *As Raon was about to head to the indoor gymnasium after finishing the clean up, Runaan approached him.\u201cRaon.\u201dWith shining purple eyes, she lowered her head.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dHe shook his head. He did help her, but she was the one who played the most important part. It wasn\u2019t something to be thanked for.\u201cThank you anyway.\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t do much.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI really\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cHaah, alright.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dHe waved his hand in resignation and Runaan finally nodded.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dRaon checked Runaan\u2019s eyes and hands. It looked like she was released from Syria\u2019s brainwashing, but he had to ask her to be certain.\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan smiled slightly. It was a smile without wrinkles, and it looked like it was resolved for now.\u201cIf your brother makes it difficult for you again, just tell me. I\u2019ll help you with anything I can.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dRunaan was about to nod, then shook her head instead.\u201cI need to do it myself.\u201dHer eyes were shining. It looked like her mind had become stronger as her wound healed up.\u201cOkay.\u201dRaon smiled. Runaan thanked him one more time and left the training ground.Are you not going to help the ice cream girl?\u2018She said she would do it herself. You shouldn\u2019t meddle with other people\u2019s family matters.\u2019Hmph, the King of Essence doesn\u2019t think the ice cream girl can solve it on her own.\u2018Then she will ask for help. And even if she doesn\u2019t\u2026\u2019Raon nodded. A red light glittered in his calm eyes.\u2018There is a way to solve it.\u2019***After returning to her dormitory, Runaan put the squirrel sculpture that she\u2019d received from Raon on the desk.\u201cHmm.\u201dAfter a little bit of consideration, she took out the bead ice cream box that she\u2019d put under the bed. It wasn\u2019t the one given to her by her older brother, but the one her mother had bought her.Whoosh.Upon opening the lid, the coldness coming from the box cooled down her face, exhausted from the training.She\u2019d thought she couldn\u2019t eat the ice cream anymore because it would remind her of her brother.However, Raon had removed her brother\u2019s shadow, stopping it from binding her head and heart.She wasn\u2019t afraid of her brother anymore, and she didn\u2019t dislike ice cream anymore.\u2018No.\u2019However, Runaan closed the lid again without touching the ice cream.\u2018I\u2019m going to eat tomorrow.\u2019Deciding she would share it with Raon the next day, she shoved the box back under the bed.Looking at the red-eyed squirrel that she\u2019d placed on the table, Runaan smiled slightly.***After cleaning up the training ground instead of Rimmer, who\u2019d disappeared somewhere, Raon returned to the dormitory.Whir!As he was taking off the training clothes drenched in sweat, Wrath suddenly popped up.I didn\u2019t mention this before.Wrath\u2019s frightening gaze shone from the cold flame.But you\u2019ve killed a human before.\u201cWhat?\u201dYou don\u2019t have the ability to break that shabby magician\u2019s hallucination yet. Even though you knew it was an orc, you saw it as a human. Killing it without hesitation isn\u2019t something a greenhorn that\u2019s never experienced an actual battle can do.\u201cIt was easy.\u201dRaon shook his hand to push back Wrath, who was right in front of his eyes.What?\u201cBecause my perception stat is so high, I could feel that he wasn\u2019t human. Killing a monster isn\u2019t really difficult.\u201dP-perception?\u201cYes. You can trick the eyes with magic, but you can\u2019t hide the nature of the thing.\u201dUgh, perception\u2026Raon acted with a straight face and Wrath groaned. He was completely fooled.\u2018I can\u2019t tell him about my previous life or the Ring of Fire.\u2019He couldn\u2019t give the slightest information to Wrath since he was an enemy.Even so, how can you not hesitate to kill? Just what are you? How can you have such willpower at that age?Wrath murmured that it was impossible. It seemed he was more surprised at the strong willpower he was born with, rather than his might growing at an unreasonable speed.\u201cWhy do you wanna know?\u201dUgh, I really don\u2019t like anything about you.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to gain your favor here.\u201dRaon flicked his finger at Wrath.\u201cIt gets cold whenever you speak, so shut your mouth and give me my reward already.\u201dYou cheated. I didn\u2019t know you were so tough.\u201cI\u2019m not the one who first suggested the bet, you did. You are being a loser again, despite being a king.\u201dL-loser\u2026Wrath\u2019s voice trembled. It looked like it was the first time being called a loser in his life.\u201cIs this the third victory in a row? I guess a monarch of devildom isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201dShut up! If the King of Essence could use the main body\u2019s power\u2026\u201cAnd the main body again, when are you even getting it back? And this bet has nothing to do with your main body\u2019s power.\u201dUgh\u2026Wrath\u2019s blue coldness wavered strongly, and the sound of him foaming in his mouth could be heard. It looked like he went out of his mind from the shock of losing and being ridiculed.This is a fraud for sure! Fraud!As he was about to struggle for the last time, messages appeared in front of Raon.[You\u2019ve won the bet against \u2018Wrath\u2019.][All stats have increased by 2.][You\u2019ve achieved the third victory against Wrath.][Additional stats increase due to the consecutive victories.][Strength has increased by 1.][Agility has increased by 1.][Energy has increased by 1.]\u201cHah!\u201dRaon smirked. He could feel the exhilaration of his muscle wavering from the strength and agility increasing at once.Three times to a mere human\u2026Murmuring that it was impossible, Wrath breathed out coldness as if he wanted to freeze the message.\u201cThere\u2019s still more.\u201dUgh!Pushing the irritated Wrath aside, Raon waited for the next message.[One of Wrath\u2019s traits is being created as the second reward for the bet.][The trait has been decided.][The trait \u2018Bleeding Curse\u2019 has been created.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you.\u201dHis strength, agility, and energy increased in addition to all his stats increasing by two. It was almost an increase of three to all his stats, and he even got a new trait.Wrath wasn\u2019t lacking in any way, earning the nickname \u2018giving tree\u2019.It\u2019s not a great trait. That\u2019s one of the worst abilities that the King of Essence has.\u201cIt depends on who uses it.\u201dRaon smiled. Wrath\u2019s weapon was coldness, but Raon\u2019s weapon was a sword, and he was good at surprise attacks.Using his previous life\u2019s techniques and experience, he could fully benefit from the \u2018Bleeding Curse\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201dRaon turned around and stood up. Putting his outer garments back on, he opened the dormitory\u2019s door.What?\u201cI\u2019m going to train for a bit.\u201dAgain?\u201cI need to check out the changes in my body and get used to them.\u201dYou are making the King of Essence unable to sleep!\u201cSleep later.\u201dYou should be stir-fried to death in lava!Since Raon was happy, Wrath\u2019s curses sounded like music to him. He ran towards the training ground while humming.***Two Months LaterDaybreak, the Training Grounds.Raon arrived at the training ground before anyone else and started practicing swordsmanship.Soon after, Burren and Martha arrived almost at the same time.\u201cTsk!\u201d\u201cDoes he even sleep\u2026?\u201dBurren clicked his tongue and grabbed his sword, and Martha started to warm herself up after frowning.\u201cYawn.\u201dRunaan, who was sleepy in the morning, came out late and yawned like a baby sparrow.It looked like she was completely freed from Syria\u2019s darkness, as her eyes had gotten brighter than before. They were still blank, though.The trainees that came up later also prepared to practice while chatting.As such, another day was about to begin.Bam!The training ground\u2019s door burst open, and Rimmer entered.\u201cInstructor, the door shouldn\u2019t be kicked open.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine because it\u2019s mine.\u201dRimmer waved his hand at the frowning Burren and went on the platform with light steps.\u201cSince you are in the middle of your training, just open your ears and listen.\u201dAfter clapping his hands to attract attention, he told them to keep training. It was an impossible task for the young trainees.\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t experts!\u201d\u201cJust tell us already!\u201dThe trainees waved their hands, telling him to continue.But Raon was properly listening to Rimmer\u2019s voice while focusing on his swordsmanship.\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you. You\u2019ve got a mission.\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cMission!\u201d\u201cMission?\u201dThe trainees\u2019 eyes shone like stars upon hearing the word mission. Not just the collaterals, Burren and Martha\u2019s mouths were wide open as well.Of course, Raon just kept swinging his sword and Runaan was casually yawning next to him.\u201cYes. It\u2019s your first mission.\u201d\u201cWooow!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mission!\u201d\u201cIs it finally time for a real battle?\u201d\u201cHuff, huff\u2026\u201dThere were various reactions from the trainees. Some shouted in anticipation, some clenched their fists, and some started panting in excitement.\u201cOf course, you aren\u2019t the only ones going on the mission. Since we can\u2019t leave the children alone, the instructors\u2014including me\u2014will tag along.\u201dThe trainees nodded. It looked like they expected it.\u2018First mission, huh\u2026?\u2019Raon recalled his first mission in his previous life as he listened to Rimmer.\u2018Was I eight years old?\u2019He went on a mission alone at a much younger age. It wasn\u2019t murder, but since the mission was to obtain information from an enemy camp, it was extremely dangerous and he\u2019d actually almost died.For the instructors to tag along on the first mission, he once again thought that Zieghart was not that cold-hearted.\u201cWh-what is the mission?\u201dDorian raised his hand as his lips trembled. He was already terrified, befitting the title of the biggest coward of the fifth training ground.\u201cThere\u2019s a hideout called Snow Tiger slightly outside of Zieghart\u2019s protected area.\u201dIt was a bandit\u2019s hideout in the mountains. As Raon had never heard of the name Snow Tiger, its scale shouldn\u2019t have been that big.\u201cThey are connected to the South-North Union, and they\u2019ve been living by collecting a small toll on the mountain road. However, their wrongdoing has become worse recently, as they often rob everything from the merchants or even kill them.\u201d\u201cThen our mission is the bandits' extermination!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a proper mission!\u201d\u201cBandits, huh\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe said they are connected to the South-North Union, which is one of the five Demons. It could be dangerous.\u201dSouth-North Union was one of the five Demons that opposed the six Kings, which Zieghart belonged to.It was a combined force of bandits in the Terukan mountains filling the south-western area, and the pirates of Rable River flowing from the north-east.The bandits and pirates belonging to the South-North Union were mostly powerful people, capable of using aura. As such, one could easily die if they fought them while expecting them to be common bandits or pirates.The leader of South-North Union in particular was an extremely powerful master, as one of the Ten Heavens of the Continent despite the fact that he was a leader of bandits and pirates.The trainees swallowed. It seemed their first mission and the mention of South-North Union made them nervous.\u201cWell, well. I haven't finished talking yet.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands again.\u201cLike you said, the mission was the bandits' extermination.\u201d\u201cIt was? Isn\u2019t that past tense?\u201d\u201cYes. It was the bandits' extermination, but that changed yesterday.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWh-why?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Why did the mission change?\u201d\u201cBecause the bandits attacked the village to the south of their hideout, killed everyone living there, and ran away after setting it ablaze.\u201dThe trainees closed their mouths at Rimmer\u2019s unusually cold voice.\u201cOur mission isn\u2019t the bandits\u2019 extermination, but to track and annihilate the bandits.\u201dThe trainees swallowed, looking into Rimmer\u2019s somber eyes.\u201cWhen are we departing?\u201dBurren raised his hand.\u201cThis evening.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that too early?\u201d\u201cLike I said, we don\u2019t have much time since we are going to track down the bandits that ran away, instead of attacking a hideout that won\u2019t move. There\u2019s no such thing as early or late in house missions. Once you get a mission, you need to obey.\u201d\u201c\u2026You are right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dBurren uncharacteristically acknowledged his mistake and lowered his head.\u201cYou are mostly used to training swords, but you can\u2019t use those during a mission.\u201dAs Rimmer signaled with a glance, the instructors brought five swords each.\u201cThey are the real swords that were supplied during the fight against the orcs. The weight and the shape of the blade are all identical to the training sword you\u2019ve been using. Use these swords from now on.\u201d\u201cA real sword\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m a bit nervous.\u201d\u201cWhat are you nervous about? This is something you must do.\u201dThe trainees received the real swords one by one. Although they differed in degree, their hands were all trembling.\u201cRaon, this is your sword.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon raised both his hands to accept the real sword. Even though he said its weight was the same as the training sword, it felt slightly heavier.Rimmer smiled slightly and went on the platform again.\u201cZieghart\u2019s crest isn\u2019t engraved on them, but they are the real swords provided by the house. It means that you are being acknowledged as Zieghart\u2019s swordsmen, albeit temporary.\u201d\u201cZieghart\u2019s swordsmen\u2026\u201d\u201cAcknowledged, huh?\u201dThe trainees swallowed, looking at the real swords.\u201cEven if it\u2019s temporary, you are still Zieghart\u2019s swordsman. Make sure to prepare yourselves so that you won\u2019t be ashamed, no matter what happens.\u201dRimmer told them to return and prepare to leave, then gather again before dinner.\u201cWhat do we need to prepare?\u201dBurren followed him and asked.\u201cThink about it yourself. Not just the mission, but the preparation also contributes to your growth and experience.\u201dRimmer waved his hand lightly as he answered.\u201cHmm, that\u2019s certainly the case.\u201dBurren nodded and stepped back, then Rimmer left to the rest area.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dFrom Rimmer\u2019s expression, Raon realized what Rimmer just said wasn\u2019t true.\u2018He thought it was a pain.\u2019It sounded good, but he was certain he\u2019d just made it up because it was a bother.\u2018I guess it has nothing to do with me.\u2019Raon was the best assassin, one who had completed countless missions. He didn\u2019t even need to think about what preparations he needed to track down and kill.\u2018I\u2019m a bit nervous.\u2019His heart pounded slightly at receiving a mission after such a long time.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon went back to the annex building to prepare his luggage. Sylvia and Helen, who were tending the garden, stood up and smiled at him.\u201cWhy are you here at this hour? No way, is it because you wanted to see your mom?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cSo mean.\u201dSylvia, who was approaching while smiling slightly, stood still. Her gaze was directed at the real sword on Raon\u2019s waist.\u201cThat sword\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve received a mission.\u201d\u201cPardon? A mission?\u201d\u201cM-mission? Why would a trainee get a mission\u2026?\u201dSylvia\u2019s eyes were wide, and Helen dropped the gardening sickle in her hand.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about it. It\u2019s my first mission, so I'll be accompanied by the instructors.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dUpon mentioning that the instructors would accompany him, the color came back to Sylvia and Helen\u2019s cheeks. They seemed to know what that was about.\u201cSo, you are going on your first mission. My son really has grown up.\u201dRaon lowered his body to dodge Sylvia, who came to hug him.\u201cDid you just avoid your mom?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m out of time. We are departing this evening.\u201dRaon shook his head. He was mostly embarrassed, but he also needed time to prepare.\u201cAre you really leaving so early? What kind of mission is it?\u201d\u201cTracking criminals.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of criminals?\u201d\u201cThieves.\u201dIn order to avoid worrying Sylvia and Helen, he said they were thieves instead of bandits.\u201cYou must be careful, even if they are thieves. As the saying goes, even a fly has its anger.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cIt might take some time since it\u2019s a tracking mission.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we will need to prepare some food.\u201dIt looked like they felt a bit relieved upon hearing that he was going to chase after thieves.\u201cThen let\u2019s get the beef jerky first.\u201d\u201cYes, we also need to pack some dried fruits and bread.\u201dTelling him to leave the food to them, Sylvia and Helen entered the annex building.Raon smiled, looking at the busy kitchen. He felt comfortable whenever he was home. His slight excitement and nervousness had also subsided.\u2018I guess I only need to prepare my stuff.\u2019Since Sylvia and Helen were excellent at packing food, it looked like he didn\u2019t need to worry about it.\u2018Then\u2026\u2019He just needed to pack the items to track down the criminals, and things like clothes, shoes, and robes.Raon went to his room to stuff a light backpack with whatever he needed for the mission and put it under his bed.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe calmed himself down by sitting down on the floor and cultivating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018Since they don\u2019t belong to the South-North Union, but are only connected to them, they shouldn\u2019t be that strong.\u2019Since it was their first mission, the bandits shouldn\u2019t be that powerful.\u2018Since official roads should already be blocked, we will end up fighting the bandits hiding in the mountains.\u2019The bandits\u2019 center of activity was the mountain. Even if the trainees were stronger than them, it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to find and fight them in the mountains.The trainees wouldn\u2019t be able to find the bandits at first, so the instructors would end up guiding them to encounter the bandits and fight them.\u2018Well, we don\u2019t need to go through all that.\u2019Although it was part of training, the mission was still a mission. If he caught or killed the criminals on his own, he was going to be rewarded for sure. It was clearly an opportunity for him, as someone that needed to gain accomplishments.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dBreathing out the dirty air after cleansing with the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, Raon opened his eyes.\u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019***That Evening.Because of Sylvia, who kept hugging him and wouldn\u2019t let him go, he went to the training ground later than he\u2019d planned.The other trainees were there first, and most of them were as stiff as wooden dolls.Burren was murmuring something, looking at the sky with clenched fists. Raon tried discerning it. He was saying that he was going to distinguish himself during the mission, but his voice cracked.Martha was sitting on a chair at the opposite side. She was sitting with her legs crossed, glaring at any trainee who passed by. Judging from her rougher behavior than usual, she also seemed to be nervous.On the other hand, Runaan was just staring blankly at her ice cream box. It looked like she was barely holding herself back from eating it.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to eat it right now, wouldn\u2019t it be better to put it in your bag? Since you can\u2019t use your hand like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mhm.\u201dRunaan stared into Raon\u2019s eyes for a long time, then she finally nodded and put the ice cream box into her backpack.Her eyes were wavering slightly. It looked like she was feeling a bit anxious about the fact that the ice cream box was no longer in her hand.\u2018She\u2019s amazing.\u2019Even Burren and Martha were nervous, yet Runaan was the same as always. It looked like her only interest was whether the ice cream was going to break or not.It was ridiculous, but he felt relieved that she seemed to be completely released from Syria\u2019s brainwashing.Call me later, when the girl takes out the ice cream.\u2018Hah.\u2019While Wrath was murmuring that he wanted to taste the new ice cream, Rimmer kicked open the door and entered. Instead of the usual rag, he was wearing proper leather armor.He went up onto the platform with the instructors.\u201cStand in a line!\u201dAs Raon stood in front of the platform and issued orders, the trainees lined themselves up.\u201cForty-three trainees, nobody\u2019s missing.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dRimmer nodded, smiling.\u201cIs everyone ready?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees shouted their throats off in order to forget their nervousness.\u201cIt\u2019s a real battle from now on.\u201dRimmer stood up. The smile that he always wore disappeared.\u201cThe ones that we are after are extremely evil criminals that have robbed the lives and properties of dozens of people, then burned up a whole village before running away. Don\u2019t consider them humans. Cut their head off as soon as you see them. You have my permission.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dFacing a pressure as intense as a typhoon, the trainees swallowed.\u201cOutside is a battlefield. It\u2019s hell. Don\u2019t let your guard down, brace yourselves at all times.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees replied nervously. Their voices had become even louder.\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t be nervous, either. Nervousness stiffens your body, and you won\u2019t be able to move like you usually do. I told you to not let your guard down, but I didn\u2019t tell you to be nervous.\u201d\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dRimmer smiled once again. The trainees, whose shoulders were as stiff as a rabbit\u2019s ear, slowly sighed.\u201cThat\u2019s why the role of the top trainee is important.\u201dHis gaze was directed at Raon, who was standing at the center. A soft smile, the gaze was reflecting his trust and confidence.\u201cRaon Zieghart, can you do it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dRaon slowly bowed his head. Rimmer smiled in satisfaction, looking at his calm eyes with no sign of nervousness nor carelessness.\u2018There\u2019s no need to be nervous, nor to be careless.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll do everything.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a small village, but it looked friendly, with gray smoke rising from the roofs.Since the village was part of Zieghart\u2019s domain, the burning sword emblem was engraved at the entrance.\u201cInstructor, shouldn\u2019t we keep moving instead of resting?\u201dBurren approached Rimmer and asked.\u201cLook at yourselves. You\u2019ve exhausted most of your stamina from crossing the dimensional gate. Do you think you can track them like that?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren looked back, and groaned.Although the dimensional gate allowed for long-distance travel in a short period of time, it also cost a large amount of stamina and willpower.Since it was the first time most of the trainees had used the dimensional gate, they were even more tired.\u201cTonight is your last rest. Don\u2019t worry too much, as we will be tracking them from daybreak tomorrow without any rest or sleep.\u201d\u201cBut there might be other casualties if we end up being late\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough they might be small, the Snow Tiger bandits have connections with the South-North Union. Stop thinking that you will win against them just because you are stronger. If you encounter them while tired, you might end up losing instead.\u201dRimmer glared coldly at the trainees.\u201cRemember what I told you. Don\u2019t be careless or nervous. You aren\u2019t following either of the two. Brace yourselves again as you rest tonight.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dHe went to the village first, the trainees\u2014including\u2014Raon following after him.\u201cHmm?\u201dRaon furrowed his brows. He could feel a powerful yet familiar energy from the village.\u201cInstructor.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cAre there family swordsmen in the village, by any chance?\u201d\u201cYour senses are really impressive.\u201dRimmer whistled and nodded his head.\u201cDid you really feel that?\u201d\u201cI felt a pressure too powerful to be a villager.\u201d\u201cYou are right. A swordsman was dispatched from the house, just in case the bandits decided to move to the north and attack them.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dZieghart was famous for the reliable protection they provided to the villages and cities under them. It seemed that the swordsman was dispatched as soon as a problem arose near the village.\u201cYour senses are really mysterious.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dHearing Rimmer\u2019s astonishment, Burren frowned and tried to feel the swordsman\u2019s presence. Martha snorted as if it was nothing special.\u201cZieghart\u2019s swordsmen have arrived!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dUpon arriving at the village entrance, the villagers waved their hands and cheered, recognizing the burning sword emblem on the instructors\u2019 combat uniform.\u201cOpen the gate!\u201dWithout any verification, the village gate opened. That was how much the name of Zieghart meant to them.\u2018And the same thing happened at Robert\u2019s.\u2019When he acted under Robert\u2019s emblem in his previous life, people in the South had reacted in a similar way.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon buried his desire for revenge, reignited in his heart for the first time in a long time, and entered the village. The sweet smell of dinner being prepared covered the place.\u201cWelcome, Zieghart\u2019s swords. I am Jarten village\u2019s chief, Cammon.\u201dAn old man with gray hair walked up to them with the help of a stick and bowed his head. Rimmer greeted him with a smiling face and turned around.\u201cHe said he will guide you to your lodging. Today is the last day you will be able to rest comfortably. Gather before sunrise, make sure to be on time.\u201d\u201cI still have a lot of stamina. I\u2019ll check the terrain around here in the meantime.\u201dBurren raised his hand, eyes shining.\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. It will make things easier if you check the way beforehand. But do you know the geography around here?\u201dRimmer abruptly looked down on Burren.\u201cF-from the map\u2026\u201d\u201cThis village is surrounded by forests and mountains. Even if you saw the map, you will still get confused once you\u2019re there. And what if bandits ambushed you in that state? Your head will be sent flying before you can even fight back.\u201dRimmer smiled, tapping on Burren\u2019s head.\u201cI know how you feel, but your impatience will become their opportunity. Like I\u2019ve said, they can\u2019t get away from this area, so calm down.\u201d\u201cU-understood.\u201dBurren and the collaterals awkwardly lowered their heads.\u201cStarting tomorrow, you won\u2019t be able to rest even if you want to. Take a good rest for now. We will start the operation at daybreak tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dThe trainees followed Rimmer to the center, where the village hall was located.***The next day at daybreak.Like Rimmer said, they kept marching south without rest. They filled their stomachs with dried food while walking, and they didn\u2019t sleep for more than three hours.Moreover, it started snowing heavily enough to completely block their vision, which made the trainees as slow as turtles.\u201cHmm.\u201dSweeping off the snow covering his shoulder, Raon took a glance at the trainees.\u201cHaah.\u201d\u201cDamn shitty powder falling from the sky!\u201dEven Burren and Martha were unable to walk properly due to the snow piling up to their knees.\u201cAww, this is so annoying!\u201d\u201cWhen is this heavy snow going to end?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re so slow.\u201dSince even those two were struggling, the other trainees were obviously floundering in the snow, and they couldn\u2019t even advance at half the usual speed.\u201cHehe.\u201dThere was a single exception. Runaan was smiling while gathering snow, but she was a peculiar one.Anyway, they might even end up losing the bandits at that rate.Instructor Rimmer was watching them from the side without saying anything.He seemed to think giving advice was too much since he was accompanying them as their guardian. Which meant that Raon needed to do something about it himself.\u201cStop.\u201dRaon stepped up and stopped everyone.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t force your ankle when you walk on a snowy ground. You will only end up wasting your stamina.\u201dHe continued, looking around the trainees.\u201cRelax your ankles and knees and step on the snow like you\u2019re bouncing on a leaf. You should be able to do it with a little practice, since you\u2019ve already acquired the River Footwork.\u201dRaon smoothly stepped on the snow and walked ahead as a demonstration. His legs were advancing faster than when he walked normally, almost as if he was sliding on the ice.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dThe trainees gasped.Raon demonstrated a few more times so that everyone could imitate his snow step.\u201cWe will move in a single line from now on. Burren, come forward.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhen facing a snowstorm or a strong wind, you are supposed to move in a line in order to reduce the wind resistance. You will be leading the other children at the front.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dHearing the word lead,\u00a0Burren\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cThe rest should stand in a single line, facing Burren\u2019s back.\u201dOne line was created, with Burren at the front, Martha in the middle and Runaan at the back.\u201cThe lead will change every hour. Start moving.\u201dWithout getting in the line, Raon went to the side and guided the trainees.As the trainees moved in a single line after learning the snow steps, their speed was almost twice as fast as before.\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s really fast. It is not any different from the usual.\u201d\u201cHow did Raon know about this?\u201d\u201cHe is such a mysterious guy.\u201dThe trainees admired him, looking at Raon as he single handedly walked through the snow.\u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d\u201cI know, right? He\u2019s teaching them very efficiently, like he\u2019s already experienced marching.\u201d\u201cI was about to give them some hints, but that wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201dThe instructors following behind them were also amazed.Rimmer smiled gently, looking at Raon and the trainees.***Raon and the trainees managed to arrive at a village through the snowstorm.However, the village was completely blackened, burnt up without a single sign of life.A part of the village was filled with corpses of all ages and sexes, whose names and faces couldn\u2019t be recognized.It was the village that the Snow Tiger bandits had attacked.\u201cEww!\u201d\u201cGross!\u201dThose with weak stomachs among the trainees were nauseated, and even those with strong stomachs frowned or turned their heads away.Raon stayed next to Rimmer and examined the corpses like he didn\u2019t feel anything.\u2018They were burned after being killed by a sword.\u2019They didn\u2019t die from the fire, but they were mostly slashed to death by a sword before being burned up. It looked like the bandits stole belongings by attacking the village and running away, just like he\u2019d heard.\u2018It\u2019s just that\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand why the bandits decided to attack the village when they could have just collected tolls on the mountain road.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dAs he kept looking at the corpses, Rimmer approached him with a worried expression.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dIn fact, the only people who were looking at the corpses up close were Raon and Martha.\u2018I knew it\u2026\u2019He\u2019d already had that impression, but it looked like Martha was used to seeing corpses. Or making corpses herself.\u201cAhem.\u201dBurren came up while biting his lip and examined the corpses. He was clearly forcing himself.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRunaan was having difficulties, but she was still trying to examine the wounds on the corpses to understand the bandits\u2019 swordsmanship.She was a completely different person from when she was frightened just by seeing blood. It looked like he didn\u2019t need to worry about her anymore.\u201cThis is what the Snow Tiger bandits have done. Keep this in mind and never forget, so that your swords won\u2019t hesitate upon meeting them. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHearing Rimmer\u2019s advice, the trainees' eyes shone menacingly. The nervousness from their first mission had transformed into an intense anger.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Two days later.Raon and the trainees arrived at the Ruten mountain, where the Snow Tiger bandits were thought to be hiding.They would reach the blockaded official road if they advanced for two more days, and since the house\u2019s swordsmen were closing in around them, the bandits were for sure hiding in the vicinity.\u201cAttention, everyone.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands to gather the trainees.\u201cHere is our foothold. We will be forming groups to track down their location from now on.\u201dHe personally formed the groups for them, and Raon got grouped up with Runaan.It was a relatively small group compared to other groups, who had three to four members, but it outclassed them in terms of might.\u201cTake a whistle as well.\u201dRimmer distributed a silver whistle to each group.\u201cIt\u2019s a whistle that you need to be trained to hear. Blow on it if you get in danger. The instructors watching after you will react immediately.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cInstead of whistling at the first danger, try doing what you can by yourself. You can combine forces between groups or try fighting them without our help. Just remember that their swords will be merciless, so never let your guards down.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe trainees recalled the horrible scenes in the village that the bandits had attacked, and started moving in the direction they each picked.However, Raon didn\u2019t start moving immediately. He looked around at the Ruten mountain located in the east, the low hills in the west, and the dense forest next to it.\u2018That mountain.\u2019He directed his gaze at the Ruten mountain. Since they could watch them from the mountain and they could run away from behind, the mountain was the correct place for the bandits to be.However, since it was the correct choice, the mountain wasn\u2019t the answer.There was no way that bandits that knew they were being chased and surrounded were going to hide in the mountain.The same went for the forest. They wouldn\u2019t be easily discovered because it was a dense forest, but it was also difficult for them to run away.\u2018Then, I think\u2026\u2019Raon looked at the hills. They were too visible, but there could be other terrains within.It seemed to be a good idea to check that place first.\u201cRaon.\u201dAs Raon made up his mind and stood up, Runaan approached him and tilted her head. She seemed to be wondering why they weren\u2019t moving.Raon had wondered why he was put in the same group as her, but it seemed Rimmer wanted him to take care of the soft-hearted Runaan.\u201cLet\u2019s go this way.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRaon started climbing the hills along with Runaan.\u2018I knew it.\u2019It was as expected. Though the hills looked empty at first, there was a forest that couldn\u2019t be seen from the outside. It wasn\u2019t dense, but it looked pretty deep.He lowered his gaze and examined the entrance to the forest. Apparently, the forest was full of animals. The numerous small footprints of animals made it difficult to find traces of humans.\u2018However.\u2019That would\u2019ve been the case with a normal hunter or tracker, but Raon was different.In order to become the best assassin, being skilled in murder wasn\u2019t enough. Tracking skills, perception, and information gathering all needed to reach the highest level to become the best assassin.Without giving up, Raon looked for the bandits\u2019 tracks while advancing slowly in the forest. Even though they were specialized in mountains and forests, they still must\u2019ve left some traces, since they were humans.\u2018I found it!\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes flared red. It wasn\u2019t on the ground. There was a very small sign that a human had passed by on a shoulder-high bush.\u201cHold your breath and follow me.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRaon lowered his body after hearing Runaan\u2019s answer. Guessing the bandits\u2019 location from the sign, he slowly moved his legs.\u201cStop.\u201dRaon extended his hand to the back.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere is a trap.\u201dThere was an invisible thread trap right in front of them. Passing through it would\u2019ve resulted in their legs being cut, giving the people inside a signal.\u2018I can\u2019t let that happen.\u2019Raon removed the trap in a way it wouldn\u2019t signal them and kept moving forward.How did you even see that?Wrath exclaimed.I really don\u2019t understand what kind of human you are. Even though the King of Essence has lived for a long time, it\u2019s still incomprehensible.\u2018I was lucky. It was reflecting in the sunlight.\u2019Hmph, what a joke.Wrath snorted, telling him he didn\u2019t believe him. Raon told him to think whatever he wanted and went deeper into the forest.There were more traces of the bandits. While examining the ground to find their exact location, he found a strange sign.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019It was an inappropriately small footprint. It looked like a child\u2019s footprint.\u2018Is it a child from that village?\u2019It looked like they kidnapped children from the village in order to use them as hostages.\u2018What a bunch of evil bastards!\u2019He breathed out to calm his boiling anger.\u201cRunaan.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cYour footsteps shouldn\u2019t make any sound from now on. Walk like me.\u201dHe taught Runaan how to walk without making any sound. Because it was an application of River Footwork, she managed to replicate it very quickly.\u201cAnd the whistle?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dIt would\u2019ve been a different story if there weren\u2019t hostages, but since children were involved, he needed to avoid the instructors making sounds as they came towards them at the sound of the whistle.Discovering the location of the children and bandits before whistling was the correct thing to do.\u201cBlow the whistle as soon as I give the signal.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dRunaan nodded, holding the whistle tightly.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dRaon lowered his body while pointing ahead.\u201cWe are almost there.\u201d***After crouching through the forest for about ten minutes, they found frequent traces of the bandits.\u2018They didn\u2019t even try to hide it around here.\u2019They avoided leaving traces as much as they could at the hills and forest\u2019s entrance, and there were traps in the middle, but that place was different.It seemed as if they believed they wouldn\u2019t be found out, since the traces were scattered around everywhere.\u2018As expected, it wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u2019Raon frowned after examining the surroundings. The children\u2019s traces existed there as well.\u201cThe bandits have taken children as hostages.\u201d\u201cHostages?\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s grasp the situation first before deciding whether we should blow the whistle or act by ourselves.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded immediately. It looked like she\u2019d believe him no matter what he said.\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201dRaon gestured with his head and almost crawled as he advanced, Runaan following behind him.After about ten minutes of crawling, a human voice could be heard from ahead.Raon\u2019s eyes grew as dark as shadows.They had found them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRaon crawled towards the direction the voice came from and raised his head.Two bandits were standing guard over the bushes that were blocking his vision like a wall. They seemed to be joking around and giggling.\u2018Their skills are pretty bad.\u2019They were rather developed physically, but he couldn\u2019t feel any aura from them. They were low-class warriors that couldn\u2019t use mana.He looked over them to see what was behind.A big bandit was sitting on the other side of the two chattering bandits, and a child was tied to a tree.Only wearing a thin clothing, the child\u2019s face and hands had turned red.\u201cHie.\u201dThe child groaned, unable to withstand the cold, and the bandit next to him tapped his cheek. The touch was enough to make the child tremble and shrink away.Tsk.Raon frowned and clicked his tongue. Just as he\u2019d expected on the way, the bandit was holding the child hostage.They must\u2019ve been planning to threaten their enemies by putting their sword to the child\u2019s neck.\u2018There should be a few more.\u2019They wouldn\u2019t have left the hostage where they stood guard if he was the only hostage. There were certainly going to be more hostages inside, where more bandits had gathered.\u2018What shall I do?\u2019If he tried to inform everyone and move together, the bandits would certainly realize something was going on.It could be a better idea to save the hostages and assassinate the bandits now, since they hadn\u2019t been discovered yet.\u2018And I can\u2019t leave him like that.\u2019The child\u2019s lips were completely blue. He could end up dying from the cold if left alone.\u201c......\u201dRaon turned his head. Runaan\u2019s eyes were shivering, not knowing what to do after seeing the hostage.\u201cIt will be alright.\u201dRaon whispered, creating an energy barrier to avoid sound from going out.\u201cI have a way to solve this.\u201d\u201cA way?\u201d\u201cBut you have to help me.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded, like she would do anything.\u201cOn my signal, stand up to show yourself, then block sound using mana. Can you do it?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dWithout asking the reason or the method, Runaan simply nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the rest. The two of us can save that child.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201dHearing that they could save the child, Runaan nodded more vigorously than ever.\u201cThen.\u201dLeaving Runaan where she was, Raon used his shadow footwork to move near the tree where the child was tied up.\u201cHow long do we have to stay here?\u201d\u201cThey said the crazy bastards at Zieghart have already dispatched swordsmen. The roads are all blocked, apparently.\u201d\u201cShit, are we all going to die?\u201d\u201cSince the boss said he called people from the South-North Union, our guide will arrive soon if we wait.\u201dWithout realizing someone was listening to them, the bandits blabbered about their circumstances.\u201cShut up.\u201dThe bandit sitting next to a tree reproached them, and the bandits standing watch closed their mouths.\u2018That guy is a bit different.\u2019He could feel an aura from the bandit\u2019s energy center as he sat next to the tree. He was only around the beginner level with the sword, though.In a single step, Raon arrived next to the big bandit.Runaan had already finished her preparations and was breathing silently.\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019Controlling his breath, Raon bent his knees. In a posture that would allow him to start moving at any time, he raised his finger to create a small fire.Rustle!Runaan, at his signal, stood up from the bush.\u201cWh-what is it?!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201dWhen the bandit tried to grab the child, just in case, Raon was already standing behind him.Pshk!He cut the bandit\u2019s throat as he drew his sword.\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dUnable to grab the child or draw his sword, the bandit\u2019s head was split away from his body.Before the blood gushed from the bandit\u2019s headless body, Raon kicked off from the ground.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dOf the two bandits, the one on the right turned around first. Raon turned his ankle to change directions. He dashed to the right and swung his sword.Wham!Right after stabbing the bandit in the heart, he spun his sword to aim at the last bandit\u2019s throat.\u201cWh-what\u2026?\u201dThe last bandit swallowed, looking at the sword touching his neck.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you move or make a sound.\u201d\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dThe bandit swallowed and shut his mouth. It seemed he wasn\u2019t completely stupid.\u201cRunaan, release the child.\u201d\u201cMhm!\u201dRunaan nodded energetically and went to the child.\u201cAnswer my questions. I\u2019ll pull out your bones one by one each time you refuse.\u201dRaon bent the bandit\u2019s arm and slammed him down on the ground.\u201cI-I understand.\u201dThe bandit kept nodding without any hesitation, terrified by Raon, who\u2019d killed his allies.\u201cYou are the Snow Tiger bandits, correct?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHow many are you?\u201d\u201cW-we are thirty-nine.\u201d\u201cWhere are the rest?\u201d\u201cThey are in the forest over there.\u201dThe bandit pointed towards the deeper part of the forest with his chin.\u2018Certainly.\u2019He could feel multiple presences moving deep inside the forest. Since they were at such a location, they weren\u2019t trying to hide their presence.\u201cWhen is your guard shift over?\u201d\u201cI-in about three hours.\u201d\u201cAnd the hostages?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one more in there.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRaon nodded. As he\u2019d expected, they had a hostage where they kept guard because they had another one.\u2018If there are thirty-six of them together, I can\u2019t use the same strategy.\u2019Assassinating them was an easy task, but rescuing the hostages when thirty-six people were watching was rather difficult.\u201cRaon?\u201dRunaan came to him after dressing the child in a robe. The child\u2019s face was clean, it looked like she\u2019d cleaned his face with a handkerchief.\u201cM-mister swordsman, my little sister is in there.\u201dThe child knelt in front of Raon and rammed his head against the ground. Despite his lips still bleeding from the cold, he didn\u2019t stop pleading.\u201cPlease save my little sister!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dRunaan gently patted the child\u2019s head.\u201cRaon will resolve everything for you.\u201d\u201cRunaan, you shouldn\u2019t say something like that rashly.\u201d\u201cBut you are going to do it.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dRaon cleared his throat. Runaan\u2019s eyes were clear, showing complete trust in him. Facing such a heavy trust, Raon\u2019s throat felt dry.\u201cKilling the bandits is one thing, but I think it\u2019d be better to call more people if we want to rescue the hostage safely. Since there are thirty-six bandits, including their boss, it could be dangerous.\u201d\u201cShall I use the whistle, then?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRunaan stood while still holding the child\u2019s hand. She stepped back and blew the whistle that she\u2019d got from Rimmer.Despite blowing it so hard that her face turned red, no sound came out.\u2018It definitely can\u2019t be heard.\u2019The sound was so quiet that he couldn\u2019t hear anything, despite being right next to her. He could understand why that whistle was given to them.\u201cIt\u2019s an inaudible whistle! Wake up everyone! The pursuers are here!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *As soon as she finished blowing the whistle, a husky voice could be heard from the forest.\u201cWhat is this\u2026?\u201dRaon swallowed. That reaction was certainly from hearing the whistle.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect there to be someone so sensitive\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t think they would be able to hear the whistle from so far away when even Raon himself had difficulty hearing it. Realizing that he\u2019d messed up, cold sweat ran down his back.\u201cRunaan, hide over there with the child.\u201dRaon pointed at the bush to the west.\u201cWhat about Raon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy some time here.\u201dAnswering Runaan\u2019s question, he pulled the suppressed bandit\u2019s arm towards the bush.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, so trust me. And if you get an opportunity, save the other hostage.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen he said it was alright, Runaan nodded and went to the bush to the right side.Wham!Along with a crashing noise, thirty-four bandits wearing all sorts of outfits approached together.\u201cWh-what! When did they\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, shit!\u201d\u201cWhich bastard did this?!\u201dThe bearded macho man that had the most powerful pressure ground his teeth upon seeing the dead bandits.\u2018The hostage is\u2026 over there.\u2019Raon confirmed the hostage\u2019s location while hiding in the bush.The rightmost bandit was grasping the little girl by her throat. Fortunately, he was right next to the bush where Runaan was hiding.\u201cCome out!\u201dThe bearded macho stomped on the ground and glared.\u201cIf you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll slit that girl\u2019s throat.\u201dHe drew his greatsword and aimed it at the hostage girl.\u201cTsk.\u201dGrabbing the suppressed bandit\u2019s neck, Raon stood up from the bush.\u201cA kid? Are you saying you did all this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s crazy! How could they lose to such a young brat\u2026?\u201d\u201cU-underboss\u2026\u201dThe bandit Raon was holding called him underboss. It seemed the macho man was the second-in-command of the bandits, who\u2019d also heard the whistle.\u201cWho did you call with the inaudible whistle?\u201dHe was even aware of the name of the whistle that Rimmer gave him. It looked like he used to be an instructor somewhere.\u201cWhy does it matter who I called?\u201d\u201cYou must want to die at a young age.\u201dThe underboss growled like a beast.\u201cI want to exchange hostages.\u201dRaon said, while placing his sword between the underboss and the bandit.\u201cExchange hostages?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give him back if you hand over that child.\u201d\u201cKuhahahaha!\u201dThe underboss laughed so hard that his shoulders shuddered.\u201cI don\u2019t care whether he dies or not. Unlike that girl, he isn\u2019t worthy of being a hostage.\u201d\u201cI see. Indeed.\u201dRaon nodded and put his sword against the bandit\u2019s neck.\u201cI already told you, we don\u2019t care at all that he dies. If you don\u2019t want to see this girl\u2019s head cut off, drop your sword right now.\u201d\u201cI wonder.\u201dCreating a small flame with his left pinky finger, he sent the signal to Runaan.\u201cHis worth is something that I decide, not you.\u201dRaon cut his carotid artery with his sword. A huge amount of blood gushed out from his throat, blocking the bandits\u2019 vision.\u2018Now!\u2019Raon raised the dagger he had on his waist. Using the \u2018Perception of the Snow Flower\u2019 and his senses to the best of his ability, he detected the presence of the bandit holding the girl.He threw the dagger at the bandit, filling it with energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Whack!When the blood gushing towards the sky finally calmed, they could see the bandit collapsing with a dagger stuck on his forehead.\u201cFuck! Damn it!\u201d\u201cS-stop him!\u201dWhen the underboss and the bandits started moving towards the girl that had been set free, Runaan stood up. Silver frost was imbued in her unsheathed sword.\u201cSoft Frost.\u201dAs she swung her sword, frost appeared under the bandits running towards her.\u201cWh-who is she?\u201d\u201cIce?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an attributed aura!\u201dThe bandits couldn\u2019t move carelessly, and their legs stopped. A moment\u2019s hesitation was all he needed.Thud!Raon kicked off from the ground and sprung towards the girl.\u201cStop!\u201dA bandit in his path struck down his sword.Thud!Raon deflected it by hitting the side of the sword with his hand, then cut the bandit\u2019s throat. He looked like he was riding the wind, just like Rimmer.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dThe underboss slammed down his greatsword to block his path.Raon turned his ankle to stand in front of the girl and thrust his sword.Whack!A thin sword and a huge greatsword collided, but the greatsword was the one that was pushed back.\u201cKeuh!\u201dThe underboss stepped back while gritting his teeth.\u201cI got her.\u201dIn the meantime, Runaan appeared next to him and held the girl in her arms.\u201cSerin!\u201d\u201cB-brother!\u201dThe children hugged each other and started crying.\u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201dRunaan withdrew, holding the children. Her lips were into a small, unusual smile.\u2018She\u2019s pretty good.\u2019Raon glanced at the back and smirked. Runaan acted exactly the way he wanted, as if she could read his mind. She was pretty quick witted, despite how she looked.\u201cYou damn brats! Do you know who I am?!\u201dThe underboss swung his greatsword while gritting his teeth. The bandits behind him also drew their swords, spreading murderous intent.\u201cI don\u2019t care about the name of someone who\u2019s going to die soon.\u201dThe red flame of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 flared up on Raon\u2019s sword.\u201cCome at me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Raon parried it using the side of his sword, then sliced the bandit\u2019s throat and the spear handle in a single strike.The bandit died with his eyes wide open. He looked like he didn\u2019t even realize he was dying.How are you so resolute at your age?\u2018Because these kinds of people are better off dead.\u2019Raon coldly glanced through the bandits.They were fiends that burned up an entire village and took children hostage. He didn\u2019t feel guilty about killing them.\u201cWhat are you doing? Attack him at once! He\u2019s just a kid!\u201d\u201cDiiie!\u201d\u201cArrrgh!\u201dTwenty bandits holding swords, spears, and sabers lunged at him at once.Whap!When Raon brandished his sword, silver frost came out from the ground and engulfed the bandits. It was Runaan. She\u2019d spread the frost to slow down the bandits.Thud!Raon thanked her by nodding to her slightly, then moved to the bandits\u2019 left side.\u201cY-you bastard!\u201dFacing the bandits swinging their swords at the same time, Raon kept dashing ahead instead of dodging.Grazing the bandits\u2019 swords, he swung his sword upward.The blade dyed in red sliced through two bandits at once.\u201cD-die!\u201dThe bandit behind them tried to skewer him with his spear. The deadly spearhead was thrust at Raon\u2019s heart.He lowered his body. The spearhead cut Raon\u2019s hair and scattered it in the air.\u201cHaa!\u201dTwo bandits, one holding an ax and the other a sword, lunged at him right after.Slide!Raon moved back smoothly and sliced the bandit\u2019s neck when he was caught off guard.\u201cCatch up with him!\u201d\u201cS-slippery bastard!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to come at me.\u201dRaon used the River Footwork to turn his ankle. Bending his body forward, he leapt like lightning.\u201cSince I\u2019m coming to you.\u201dBreathing through beneath the bandits that were chasing after him, Raon swiped with the 'Star-Combining Sword'.Slash!The lightning-fast consecutive strikes sent the heads of four bandits flying.\u201cHaa.\u201dWhen Raon stopped his sword to catch his breath, a powerful murderous intent appeared behind him.\u2018It\u2019s him.\u2019It was the underboss that had been staying back, looking for an opportunity. Without turning, Raon bent his back.The underboss\u2019s greatsword went over him, cutting his bangs. The golden hair fluttered in the air.\u201cH-how did you dodge that?\u201d\u201cBy doing well.\u201dRaon swung his sword up at the confused underboss.Whack!Since he was in an awkward position, the strike didn\u2019t carry much strength. However, the underboss still bounced back, unable to withstand it.\u201cAttack! Rip him into pieces!\u201d\u201cAaaaah!\u201dThe underboss and bandits holding all kinds of weapons flooded at him like a wave. Rusty swords and spears were aimed at his heart, and thick axes walloped at his head.Thud!Raon took a deep breath and stepped on the ground. He sliced his sword, which contained the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, diagonally from left to right.Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation. Wind of Flame.The blade of heat, carried by the wind, sliced through the underboss and the bandits at the same time.\u201cKugh\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh, huh?\u201dUnable to believe their death, the bandits were split in half and collapsed.\u201cArrgh!\u201d\u201cM-monster!\u201d\u201cHow can a child like that\u2026?\u201dThe last few remaining bandits backed away with trembling hands.\u201cWhere is your bo\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, this is ridiculous.\u201dA man wearing an unbuttoned top came out of the bushes. Despite his young face, at about thirty years old, his pressure was extremely violent. Raon understood from his strong malice that he was the ringleader.\u201cBoss!\u201d\u201cLeader!\u201dA light of hope shone upon the bandits that had been trembling in fear. As expected, that man was the Snow Tiger\u2019s leader.\u201cHow can you get annihilated by a small kid? I\u2019d just get humiliated even if I joined the South-North Union like this.\u201dThe man giggled, bringing the liquor bottle he had around his waist to his mouth. There was no sign of anger, despite many bandits having died. Instead, he seemed to find the situation interesting.\u201cThose are some very elegant faces and clothes. You gotta be from a rich family, huh?\u201dThe bandit boss giggled and pointed at Raon, then Runaan.\u201cWell, that\u2019s better. I was worried my presents weren\u2019t enough, but I\u2019m gonna take you hostage. It seems I, Bookan, haven\u2019t been abandoned by heaven.\u201dIntroducing himself as Bookan, the bandit boss drew his saber. He started spinning a saber as thick as a log as if it was a leaf.\u2018If his name is Bookan, he\u2019s indeed the boss.\u2019That was the name of the Snow Tiger\u2019s leader, the one that Rimmer had mentioned before. The fact that his might was above average among the aura users also matched the description.He was the strongest opponent so far.However, there was no tension, as he was an opponent Raon could easily win against.\u201cCome at me. Since you are a young master, I\u2019ll let you have a head start.\u201dBookan giggled, and put his fingers together, wagging them.\u201cFine.\u201dRaon signaled Runaan to stay back, then stepped up.\u201cLet\u2019s see how strong this kid i\u2026\u201dWhile Bookan was carelessly blabbering, Raon thrust his sword at his neck.Whoosh!The blade, filled with the energy of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, lunged at Bookan\u2019s neck.\u201cHuh!\u201dBookan gasped and swung his saber. Spinning like a windmill, the blade managed to deflect the sword\u2019s trajectory.Smack!The powerful impact pushed both Raon and Bookan back at once.\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty strong!\u201dBookan\u2019s eyes glowed like a hungry beast.\u201cVery interesting!\u201dBursting out in laughter, he pounced. Rotating his saber, he slammed it down.Raon didn\u2019t face the attack head on. Instead, he dodged it by turning his body.Crash!The saber split the ground upon reaching it. It was a monstrous strength.\u201cKuhahaha!\u201dBookan laughed like crazy and continuously slammed down his saber. As a gigantic saber dominated the space, his movement grew more and more restricted.\u201cYou are going to be sliced to death if you keep trying to dodge.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201dRaon calmly kept using the footwork and blocked the strikes.\u201cTsk, I guess we don\u2019t need to continue this any further if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got.\u201dBookan pouted and kept swinging his saber. The huge saber that was riding the wind shone blue and exploded with a powerful energy.\u201cJust die!\u201dThe moment his saber rose into the air and his motions grew large, red lightning struck Raon\u2019s eyes.\u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, First Flame.Flame Spirit.Flame appeared at the tip of the silver blade and blossomed, riding the wind.Slash!The fierce energy of the small flame cut through Bookan\u2019s saber and cut him at his waist.\u201cGaaaah!\u201dBookan screamed, grabbing the sword stabbing into his ribs.\u201cY-you bastard!\u201dHolding the blade, he pushed back with tremendous strength. It looked like he wasn\u2019t the boss for nothing.\u201cDie!\u201dHolding the sword stabbing his ribs with his left hand, he swung his saber at Raon\u2019s neck with his right hand.\u201cPointless.\u201dRaon dodged the cut by tilting his neck slightly, then used Bookan\u2019s strength to thrust his sword in even more to the right.\u201cKugh!\u201dA brutal amount of blood gushed from Bookan\u2019s side. Releasing the sword he was holding, Bookan backed off.\u201cWh-what\u2019s everyone doing?! Kill him! Do you wanna die here?\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cL-let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cSave the boss!\u201dThe bandits dashed towards Raon at once, hearing Bookan\u2019s shout.\u201cHuu.\u201dRaon caught his breath and swung his sword. Using Zieghart\u2019s basic technique, he decapitated the bandits running at him and sliced their legs.\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThe wall of bandits screamed and collapsed.\u2018Where is he?\u2019Raon looked for Bookan\u2019s location while swinging his sword. He wasn\u2019t there anymore. He couldn\u2019t find his location with his perception either.\u2018He escaped!\u2019The boss had used his underlings as a shield in order to run away. It was an act befitting of a bandit.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon grit his teeth and emanated his pressure.\u2018I don\u2019t have much time.\u2019Unlike him, Bookan should\u2019ve been familiar with the surrounding area. It was going to be difficult to catch him again if he escaped.Whir.He swung his sword, using the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 at its full power.The moment the blade dyed in red sliced like lightning, the bandits in front of Raon had their heads separated from their bodies.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201d\u201cUh!\u201dThe bandits foolishly collapsed before they even realized they were killed.\u201cArrrgh!\u201d\u201cN-no! We can\u2019t win against that! He\u2019s a monster!\u201d\u201cB-boss! Boss! Huh?\u201d\u201cDid that son of a bitch run away?\u201d\u201cS-surrender! I surrender!\u201dThe last few remaining bandits screamed. Upon realizing the leader had run away, they all dropped their weapons and knelt down.\u201cRunaan!\u201dAfter checking the bandits that surrendered, he looked at Runaan.\u201cI\u2019ll follow the leader. Kill them without hesitation if they try anything funny.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan casually answered while hugging the children tightly. The bandits\u2019 faces went pale.\u201cLater.\u201dUsing the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, Raon took off.Entering the area that the bandits came from initially, he widened his perception and rolled his eyes.\u2018Where is he?\u2019Since the traces of bandits were everywhere, it was difficult to track him down.However, he couldn\u2019t hide his sound.\u2018Southwest.\u2019His hearing, enhanced by the \u2018Perception of the Snow Flower\u2019, caught a rustling sound from a bush in the southwest.Thud!He ran like the wind towards the source of the sound. It didn\u2019t take long before he found Bookan\u2019s presence, his back visible.\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019Bookan wasn\u2019t alone. He was running through the forest like a mad man, holding a woman in his arms.\u201cThat\u2019s as far as you go.\u201dRaon cut him off, running at full speed using the River Footwork.\u201cShit! How did you chase after me?\u201dBookan stepped back with trembling lips.\u201cDon\u2019t come! I\u2019ll kill her if you come any closer!\u201dPutting his saber on the woman\u2019s neck, he threatened.\u201cI\u2019m at the end of my rope. I\u2019ll kill her if anything goes wrong!\u201d\u201cThen you will also die.\u201dRaon didn\u2019t succumb to his threat. Using the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 and \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, he slowly approached him.\u2018Showing weakness because of the hostage is the worst thing to do.\u2019He needed to show him that the hostage didn\u2019t have any effect on him in order to catch him off guard.And the hostage was actually meaningless to him.\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe leader screamed and threw away the woman he was holding.\u201cHaa!\u201dRaon ran up and caught the falling woman with his left hand.\u201cTh-thank you.\u201dThe moment the clean woman nodded at him, a blue snake popped out from her sleeve.\u201cWe did it!\u201dBookan cheered.\u201cWhat did you do?\u201dRaon laughed coldly and stabbed the sword in his right hand.Whack!Piercing through the snake\u2019s head, the blade also crushed her heart.\u201cKugh! How?!\u201d\u201cEarlier, he said there were thirty-nine bandits in total. You must be the last one.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of crazy bastard counts that\u2026\u201dThe woman couldn\u2019t close her eyes as she died because of how ridiculous that was.\u201cAnd she was too clean for a hostage.\u201dActually, that wasn\u2019t everything. The ring with red lines that she had on her finger was the mark of a snake user.The number of bandits was one thing, but he noticed she wasn\u2019t a hostage from the ring and her clean appearance.\u201cWh-who are you?!\u201dBookan, the Snow Tiger leader screamed. He just kept trembling, plopping down on the ground. It seemed he\u2019d realized he couldn\u2019t run away.\u201cIt must\u2019ve been fun when you were the one doing the killing.\u201dPulling the sword from the woman\u2019s heart, he approached Bookan.\u201cG-get away!\u201dBookan screamed, frantically swinging his saber. His gaze, which used to be fierce, was now trembling in fear.\u201cYou attacked and plundered the village, even took children hostage. You are worse than a fiend.\u201dI\u2019m sorry, but there are many fiends that can do worse. I mean, there are countless.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIgnoring Wrath, Raon approached Bookan.\u201cShut up!\u201dBookan leapt up like a grasshopper and swung his saber. The saber\u2019s sharp blade, full of aura, glowed menacingly.However, the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 had already finished analyzing his techniques. Raon swung his sword after easily dodging it.Slash!Bookan\u2019s right arm fell to the ground.\u201cKuaaaah!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have the right to scream.\u201d\u201cW-wait, I\u2019ll give you an elixir! The elixir I got in that village\u2026 Kugh!\u201dRaon severed his head without hesitation. The head of the disgraceful bandit fell to the ground and rolled away.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dCatching his breath, he sheathed his sword.\u2018He mentioned an elixir.\u2019He said he\u2019d attacked the village for the elixir. He must've kept it somewhere in his body.When he examined Bookan\u2019s clothes, he found a small pouch.\u201cThis is it.\u201dHe opened the pouch. There was a flower bud that hadn't burst yet. It was a strange bud with leaves that were half blue and half red.\u201cFor such a petty reason.\u201dRaon frowned while touching the flower bud.It was an elixir called Teuton Flower, which had the energy of both fire and water attributes.It was rare, but it wasn\u2019t something so extraordinary that it would warrant annihilating an entire village.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe regretted killing Bookan so quickly.Human greed is like that. It seems the King of Essence is getting to witness more greed here in the human world than back in the devildom. What an interesting world.Raon didn\u2019t respond to Wrath. He wasn\u2019t ignoring him, but he couldn\u2019t rebuke it because Wrath was correct.\u201cHmm?\u201dIt was as Raon was about to head back, licking his lips. that his head suddenly started hurting. He remembered something from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Teuton Flower.That wasn\u2019t the true form of the flower that didn\u2019t blossom.\u2018If I had that, it would become a much more potent elixir\u2026 huh?\u2019The moment he realized Teuton Flower\u2019s true form, thanks to the knowledge from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, he felt the presence of someone moving in the southern bushes.Rustle.A man appeared through the bush. He was wearing a tiger skin leather jacket and a yellow bandana on his head. He could either be a hunter or a bandit.\u201cHuh? Is everything over already?\u201dHe licked his lips, looking at the Snow Tiger leader\u2019s corpse at his feet.\u201cAll the efforts of coming to help him through Zieghart\u2019s encirclement was in vain.\u201dThe man in a tiger leather jacket raised his head and met Raon\u2019s eyes.\u201cDid you do this? That\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\u201cSouth-North Union, huh?\u201dA yellow bandana was the mark of South-North Union, which was one of the Five Demons.The fact that he\u2019d appeared in that place, and the way he seemed to feel sorry about the Snow Tiger leader\u2019s death, all proved that he was from the South-North Union.\u201cMy name is Raptor.\u201dHe introduced himself. It seemed he didn\u2019t need to hide it.\u2018Raptor.\u2019Raon frowned upon hearing the name. It was a name he\u2019d heard in his previous life.The genius swordsman who had become the boss of a large group of bandits in South-North Union ten years after joining them with nothing but a single sword.Unlike the Snow Tiger leader, Raptor was a real warrior at a different level.\u201cDid you take the elixir he had?\u201d\u201cWhat if I did?\u201dRaon nodded. Since he\u2019d arrived when he was looking at the Teuton Flower, it was impossible to hide it anyway.\u201cYou look confident. Well, I guess your judgment is also pretty good, despite your age.\u201dHe looked at the snake user.\u201cAnd you are pretty strong. I guess that\u2019s why you can be so confident.\u201dAfter checking the headless Bookan\u2019s corpse, Raptor\u2019s gaze was directed at Raon once again.\u201cDescendant of a great family, you must be a member of the direct line of Zieghart, one of the six Kings. Considering you don\u2019t have the flame sword emblem, you must still be a trainee. Hmm, what shall I do?\u201dHe licked his lips while fondling the sword around his waist.\u201cShall I kill you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moment Raptor mentioned killing him, he was engulfed in an intense murderous intent.However, murderous intent wasn\u2019t really effective on him, someone that had lived as an assassin. He pushed back the murderous intent by resonating the four \u2018Rings of Fire\u2019.\u201cOh!\u201dRaptor exclaimed, with his eyes wide. His lips parted in his curiosity at how he managed to withstand his murderous intent.\u201cThis guy isn\u2019t a sprout, but a bud ready to burst.\u201dHe smirked and tapped the sheath of his sword. It seemed he was contemplating whether he should use it or not.\u2018I can\u2019t win against him\u2019Assassinating him was possible but winning against him in a straight fight was impossible. However, Raon also had a card up his sleeve.Clank.Raon drew his sword first.\u201cDraw your sword and fight.\u201dHe revived the pressure that\u2019d subsided and pointed his sword at Raptor.\u201cDo you realize you will die if I draw this sword?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s natural for the weak to die.\u201d\u201cHah! How is this young guy so spirited?\u201dRaptor exclaimed and clapped. His hands were now completely away from his sword.\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight anymore, not after witnessing your spirit. It\u2019d be a shame to kill you here.\u201d\u201cA warrior doesn\u2019t choose his place to die.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s crazy. Are you really a kid? Am I reading an analect right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s not actually the only reason.\u201dRaptor\u2019s gaze went over Raon and reached the top of a tree.\u201cEven if I manage to retrieve that elixir, it\u2019s pointless if I end up dying instead.\u201dHe nodded towards the tree and withdrew.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Raon licked his lips. The instructors were currently hiding behind him.He couldn\u2019t find Rimmer\u2019s location, but he must\u2019ve been close considering his character.Raptor withdrew because he\u2019d sensed their presence.\u201cIt would\u2019ve been really fun if you were in the South-North Union. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon closed his eyes without answering. Raptor\u2019s question reminded him of his old memories.When he lived as an assassin in his previous life, people rarely asked anything like that. Even if they did, he wasn\u2019t allowed to answer.He\u2019d always either run away without saying anything or attacked them with the intent to kill.His heart shook slightly to the fact that an enemy, and a person famous for his might, had asked his name.\u201cAre you not going to tell me your na\u2026\u201d\u201cMy name is Raon. Raon Zieghart.\u201dRaon slowly opened his eyes, and confidently stated his name\u201cI see. Raon, I\u2019ll be looking forward to hearing your name from the Terukan Mountains and Rable River.\u201dHe grinned and went down the mountain. Raon stayed alert just in case he decided to return, but he was really gone.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon sighed and sheathed his sword.\u2018It worked.\u2019Raptor had a manly personality, despite his pretty appearance.He managed to leave a favorable impression from acting rashly in an unfavorable situation. It all went according to the information he received in his time at House Robert.\u2018I\u2019m glad it ended without a fight.\u2019Raptor was strong. He would\u2019ve been able to win if he fought with Rimmer, but multiple instructors would\u2019ve died. Avoiding the fight was the best-case scenario.Raon put the elixir in his shirt and put the Snow Tiger leader\u2019s head in a thick bag. He needed to bring the head back in order to get the accomplishment.\u201cThen let\u2019s return.\u201dHe smiled towards the top of the tree.***Rimmer had already located the bandits when the children started the search.Once he erased the distractions\u2014the dense forest and high mountains\u2014he immediately realized the location of the bandits\u2019 hideout.However, that was because he\u2019d accumulated countless experiences, and it was a different story for the trainees.Just like he\u2019d expected, the trainees went to the mountain and the forest first.Burren and Martha weren\u2019t an exception. They were both headed towards the mountain and the forest and started searching like a hunting dog on a scent.Since it was such a natural thing to do, he wasn\u2019t even surprised.However, Raon and Runaan were standing still on the road instead of moving away.They only started moving a long time after the other trainees had already started the search.And the direction they decided to go wasn\u2019t the forest or the mountain, but the hills.Really?The bandits had picked the forest next to the hills as their hideout, the one that wasn\u2019t visible from the outside. It was difficult to determine how they managed to find out about it.It\u2019s Raon after all.It seemed Raon determined that the bandits were in the hills using his excellent insight.However, as expected of bandits that live in the mountains, they\u2019d erased most of their tracks. It was difficult even for the instructors to find them, so it would be impossible for Raon and Runaan to find the bandits\u2019 presence.However, after looking through the forests on the hills, Raon looked like he\u2019d found something as he went in.Then, he found the traces of humans one by one, and slowly advanced towards the bandits\u2019 hideout.What the hell was he?Rimmer\u2019s jaw dropped. He was on his first mission, yet he was finding the bandits' traces like a professional tracker. That was ridiculous.And he wasn\u2019t even advancing normally. Lowering his body, he wasn\u2019t even making any sound because he was walking on the tips of his toes.Wow, did he just dismantle that trap?Raon and Runaan removed the trap installed by the bandits and finally reached the bandits hideout.And there was a hostage that Rimmer didn\u2019t even know about.What are you going to do?Rimmer moved closer to the tree that the kid that was taken hostage was bound to. He was going to make his move if Raon or Runaan ended up failing.However, it wasn\u2019t necessary.Raon distracted the bandits standing guard, using Runaan as a bait, then beheaded the one guarding the hostage.Gulp.The sharp and definite strike sent chills down his spine. The way he blocked the sound with an energy barrier and killed the other bandit was also perfect.Then he gathered information by leaving one bandit alive. He really looked like a professional.However, there was one mistake. No, it was a coincidence.The inaudible whistle. The underboss detected the whistle that one needed to be trained to hear.Raon wasn\u2019t flustered when facing such a crisis. He immediately came up with a new plan, hiding Runaan and the child.He leaped in after making the underboss and the bandits careless, rescuing the second hostage in one fell swoop.The rest was a battle.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Fiddling with his fingers, Rimmer watched the battle with Raon on the frontline and Runaan on the backline.He stretched his legs, so that he could be prepared to help them if things got dangerous, but that never happened.Runaan spread her frost and Raon swung his sword. The bandits couldn\u2019t even swing their weapons and ended up dead.The bandit leader, who came out while pretending to be cool, abandoned his underlings and ran away when he realized that he couldn\u2019t win against Raon.\u2018I\u2019ll need to catch him myself.\u2019There wasn\u2019t enough time to catch the leader after killing the rest of the bandits, not while protecting the two hostages.Since he couldn\u2019t let the leader escape, Rimmer started chasing the leader.Hostage? No, that was also a bandit.The leader went down the hills, carrying the female bandit like a hostage.Then let\u2019s catch\u2026Just as Rimmer was about to make a surprise attack, he heard someone running up from behind.It was Raon.He was dashing towards the bandit leader\u2019s location like a lion.The leader pretended to panic and threw the female bandit at him, and Raon slowed down to catch her.Shit\u2026Rimmer frowned. The woman was a snake user. He needed to save Raon before he got bitten by the snake.However.The moment the snake came out, Raon moved his right hand.Whack!As if he knew about it already, he pierced through the snake and the woman\u2019s heart with his sword without any hesitation.\u201cWow.\u201dRimmer\u2019s exclamation leaked out. He showed no sign of confusion as he killed the snake. It wasn\u2019t something he could\u2019ve done unless he\u2019d realized it beforehand.How could someone like him exist?He wasn\u2019t even admiring it anymore. His mind was going numb.He\u2019d seen countless talents by wandering from one battlefield to another for dozens of years, yet this was his first time seeing such a monster.After decapitating the Snow Tiger leader, Raon even took the elixir he had.\u2018Yes, good job.\u2019He held himself back from applauding. When he looked aside, the other instructors were also astonished.Just as he thought everything was over, a pretty young man appeared with an intense pressure.Yellow bandana and powerful energy. It was a warrior from South-North Union.So, they were associated with the South-North Union after all.He was wondering why the Snow Tiger bandits were still hiding, and it was because they were waiting for the warrior from the South-North Union.The warrior introduced himself as Raptor.He knew that name.The genius young swordsman that became the leader of bandits a mere ten years after joining the South-North Union.Raon wasn\u2019t intimidated by Raptor. He drew his sword, telling him to fight.That guy\u2026It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t recognize Raptor\u2019s strength. It was his determination that he wouldn\u2019t surrender as a Zieghart\u2019s warrior.Raptor was dumbstruck, but also admired Raon\u2019s spirit.Then he withdrew on his own.Of course, he did that because he knew that the instructors\u2014including Rimmer\u2014were hiding nearby, but his hospitality towards Raon was one of the reasons.\u201cI\u2019m Raon. Raon Zieghart.\u201dAh.Watching Raon, who confidently stated name, after being recognized by somebody stronger than him, made chills run down his spine.The scene of him meeting Glenn in the past replayed in his head like Deja vu.Rimmer clenched his fist.King.He was still young and weak, but it seemed the seed of the new king had finally sprouted.***Raon returned to Runaan and the children. The instructors that\u2019d arrived after hearing the inaudible whistle had already suppressed the leftover bandits.\u201cYou are back.\u201d\u201cThat was a great accomplishment.\u201d\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201dThe instructors spoke, full of admiration, surprise, and astonishment.\u201cRaon.\u201dRunaan approached him, holding the two children. The eyes of the kids wearing robes were completely swollen. It looked like they\u2019d cried their hearts out.\u201cRunaan. You really did great.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just a formality. He\u2019d managed to safely rescue the children thanks to her appropriate action.\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan visibly nodded. She looked happy as she patted the children\u2019s heads.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon, who was about to pat the two children\u2019s heads, stopped when he realized that his hand was stained in blood.\u201cIt\u2019s alright now.\u201dHe grabbed the children\u2019s shoulders and smiled lightly. He wanted to keep talking to them, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say.\u201cWaaaa!\u201dThe boy started crying while hugging his little sister tightly. It seemed he\u2019d been holding himself back as the older brother.\u201cYou guys should return for now.\u201dThe instructors pointed towards the foothold under the hills as they dug into the ground.\u201cWhat about the instructors?\u201d\u201cWe will follow after taking care of this place. Leave the rest to us. You really did a great job.\u201dThe instructors put their thumbs up.\u201cOkay.\u201dRaon nodded and left the forest full of bandits\u2019 stench, Runaan and the children following him.Don\u2019t you even know how to comfort kids? Back in the devildom, the King of Essence once faced a greater famine. Taking pity on the starving young devils, the King of Essence opened the winter castle\u2019s door and\u2026\u2018Old man, that\u2019s enough.\u2019Moreover, how did you take so long to kill mere bandits? Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed that you can\u2019t even use your power properly, despite having the King of Essence with you?\u2018How am I supposed to use my power?\u2019You idiot. It\u2019s the first strike. First strike. You have to thrust your first strike with explosive power.\u2018Explosive?\u2019Yes. The human\u2019s mana circuit is quite mysterious, and you can handle your mana after amplifying it\u2026Raon learned a more effective way of handling mana by instigating Wrath. He was the Giving Wrath, after all.***When Raon and Runaan returned to the foothold along with the children, the center was noisy.\u201cIt\u2019s the mountain. I\u2019m sure they are hiding at the peak.\u201d\u201cBullshit. Mountain is too obvious, just like your hairstyle. You\u2019re an idiot for thinking that they would be hiding in the mountain just because they\u2019re bandits. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re hiding in the dense forest in the west.\u201d\u201cYour method is too impulsive. Relying on instincts without a proper tracking technique or map reading is too dangerous.\u201d\u201cShut up! My instincts are better than your reasoning. We will search the western forest tomorrow, no matter what.\u201dBurren and Martha were arguing, telling each other that there were bandits where they\u2019d scouted.\u201cPhew, they\u2019re at it again.\u201d\u201cThey really start arguing as soon as they meet.\u201d\u201cBut I wonder who\u2019s correct?\u201dThe trainees didn\u2019t know what to do as they watched the two growl at each other.\u201cHmph!\u201dWhen Runaan cleared her throat, everyone looked at Raon, Runaan, and the children.\u201cWho are those children?\u201d\u201cDid you find some runaway kids when you were supposed to look for the bandits?\u201dBurren and Martha frowned, upon seeing the two children.\u201cI wonder. Guess who?\u201dRaon grinned, putting the bag containing the bandit leader\u2019s head down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stop lying!\u201dMartha shoved her face at Raon, telling him to stop speaking nonsense.The two of them, no, every trainee in the foothold was stunned, unable to believe they\u2019d managed to rescue the hostages from the bandits.\u201cThink whatever you want.\u201dRaon snickered and brought the children near the bonfire.\u201cRest here for now.\u201dLetting them settle in front of the fire, he gave them some of the beef jerky that Sylvia and Helen had prepared for him.\u201cYou can eat this for now.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d\u201cTank yuu.\u201dThe boy lowered his head and the girl copied him, lowering her head as well.The two children started nibbling on the beef jerky. Their eyes were teared up with sorrow.\u201cDorian.\u201d\u201cEh? Yes!\u201d\u201cDo you have a blanket? A clean one.\u201d\u201cOf course I do.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dDorian took out a long green blanket from his belly pocket. Raon covered the children\u2019s shoulders with the blanket.\u201cEat this, too.\u201dRunaan met the children\u2019s eyes by kneeling down. She took out the ice cream box from her bag, opened the lid, and handed it out to them.The last two remaining bead ice creams. Moreover, even though she\u2019d kept her favorite flavors for the end, there was no hesitation in her gesture.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe girl tilted her head.\u201cIt\u2019s ice cream.\u201dRunaan told them that it was cool and delicious, and cleaned the girl\u2019s hand before giving the ice cream.\u201cAww!\u201dThe girl screamed after trying to touch the ice cream with her tongue. Of course, it was a pleasant scream. Using her small tongue, she started licking the ice cream like a kitten.\u201cWoah!\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes were wide after taking a bite. However, he gave the rest of the ice cream to his little sister instead of finishing it.Raon licked his lip as he watched the two children. He felt bitter.\u2018He became an adult.\u2019Just like with the bandits, he was thinking about his little sister before anything else. It seemed the boy that had lost his parents had already grown into an adult.Raon thought he was better than his previous life, where he could only follow Derus Robert\u2019s instructions, and lightly tapped the boy\u2019s shoulder.Huh. He actually managed to defeat the ice cream\u2019s temptation, one that even the King of Essence succumbed to. He is going to grow up splendidly, get him on your side. I like him.Wrath murmured that he wanted to keep him as his underling.\u201cSniff!\u201dRaon raised his head, hearing a sniffing sound. Dorian was watching the children with teary eyes.\u201cEat this, and this. Eat them all!\u201dHe brought out all his favorite snacks from his belly pocket and piled them up in front of the children. He was a kind-hearted guy.\u201cRescuing the children is one thing, but we need to take care of the bandits. I\u2019m sure they will try to run away once they realize the hostages have been rescued.\u201d\u201cYes, where are those bastards? I\u2019m going to snap the necks of that human garbage, no exceptions.\u201dAs Raon was watching the children eating snacks, Burren and Martha approached with feverish and angry eyes, respectively. They tapped their sword sheaths, signaling him to bring them to the bandits already.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean we don\u2019t need to?! We need to finish the mission properly\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201dAs Burren was about to argue, Rimmer and the instructors came out from a bush in the direction of the mountain. There were only three instructors missing, those who\u2019d stayed behind to clean up the bandits\u2019 traces.\u201cWhy are there children here?\u201dThe instructors, including Rimmer, tilted their heads and pretended that they didn\u2019t know anything.\u2018Even though they already know everything!\u2019Raon wrinkled his mouth. He couldn\u2019t discern Rimmer\u2019s exact location, but he was certainly watching over him.\u201cYou already know about it.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dRimmer shrugged, feigning ignorance.\u201cWe saved them with Raon.\u201d\u201cDid you save those children?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the other instructors tell you?\u201d\u201cAh, now that I think about it, three of them are missing. Where did they go?\u201d\u201cHaa, I\u2019ll explain.\u201dRaon sighed and stood up. Rimmer looked like he wanted him to explain it in front of everyone.\u201cWe found the bandits\u2019 tracks in front of a forest inside the hills and started chasing after them. There were very small traces, but we managed to find the bandits deep into the forest after tracking them down and\u2026\u201dHe explained in detail everything that happened that day.\u201cSo that\u2019s how we killed the Snow Tiger leader and rescued the children.\u201dSilence filled the place as he finished his explanation.\u201cN-nonsense\u2026\u201dBurren swallowed.\u2018How could he actually finish the mission while I was digging the wrong hole\u2026?\u2019Raon was saying he\u2019d rescued the hostages and annihilated the bandits while he was wasting his time. It was an unbelievable story, but he had no choice but to believe considering the circumstances.\u201cDamn it!\u201dDespite losing in spars and training, he\u2019d resolved to get better accomplishments during the mission at least. He failed once again.No, failing was an understatement. He couldn\u2019t even match up to him. Realizing how pathetic he was, he despised his arrogance in the past.\u201cShit! Damn it!\u201dMartha turned around and punched a tree. It stripped the bark off the tree and it fell to the ground.\u2018That\u2019s not a lie.\u2019From what she\u2019d seen so far, Raon wasn\u2019t somebody who would lie. She was certain that Raon really had rescued the hostages and exterminated the bandits, just him and Runaan.\u2018Fucking hell!\u2019Realizing Raon and Runaan were risking their lives while she was arguing with Burren like a child, she felt so frustrated that she wanted to cry.\u2018I wanted to end it.\u2019She wanted to cancel her promise to follow Raon by completing the mission perfectly, but it was her complete loss. There was no room for excuses.\u201cHaaaa\u2026\u201dAcknowledging her loss, Martha sighed heavily.\u201cH-he annihilated the bandits on his own?\u201d\u201cAnd he tracked them by himself, then also rescued the hostages\u2026\u201d\u201cSeriously, what the hell is he?!\u201dThe trainees' chins trembled. Everyone was looking at Runaan and Raon, unable to hide their surprise.\u201cIs that true?\u201dOne of the instructors came up to Raon. He looked like he really didn\u2019t know any of that. He must\u2019ve been watching after the others.\u201cThe Snow Tiger leader\u2019s might is at Sword User\u2019s mid-high level. How could you win against him? Are you sure it wasn\u2019t a mistake?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d\u201cYou can check for yourself.\u201dRaon pointed at the bag, which could be called his spoil of war.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe instructor nodded and opened the bag.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Red hair and a big scar around the eye.\u2019It matched the appearance of the Snow Tiger leader, which he had been given when he accepted the mission. His hands were trembling violently as he looked at Raon.\u201c...There\u2019s no mistake.\u201dThe instructor swallowed and turned to Raon.\u201cHmm\u2026 It was just a verification for the mission, so please don\u2019t take offense.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAs Raon nodded, the instructor nodded back and returned to Rimmer.\u2018Rimmer probably made him do that.\u2019Judging from Rimmer\u2019s playful gaze, Raon realized he was the one behind it. It was probably to convince those that couldn\u2019t believe it or were doubting him.As a result, the gazes the trainees directed at him and Runaan were filled with admiration and astonishment.\u2018I wonder why.\u2019Rimmer had been kind to him, more than an instructor should\u2019ve been. Since he was so different from the instructor in his previous life, he couldn\u2019t honestly understand why.\u201cThen, is the mission over?\u201d\u201cBut we didn\u2019t do anything yet\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm, can we really leave now\u2026?\u201dThe trainees were glad that they could return to their homes and rest easy, but they also seemed worried since they hadn\u2019t done anything during the mission.\u201cDon\u2019t be so depressed.\u201dRimmer smirked, looking at the awkward trainees.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare for anyone to skillfully complete their first mission. Those instructors also kept making mistakes, or couldn\u2019t do anything at all during their first mission.\u201dThe instructors nodded, confirming what he said.\u201cThen what about Raon and Runaan?\u201d\u201cYeah. They finished the mission by themselves.\u201d\u201cWell, you know, those are the rare people we call monsters. You should already be used to them, shouldn\u2019t you? Actually, I also did great on my first mission. It was a huge ruckus. I rushed at the enemies holding a single sword\u2026\u201dRimmer giggled and started describing his performance on his first mission.That bastard\u2019s story isn\u2019t even amazing. Back in devildom, the King of Essence froze an entire castle during his first battle. It became a legend throughout the entirety devildom\u2026\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon shook his head. His eardrums started to hurt because of how much Wrath was talking.***Rimmer announced the mission\u2019s completion and said they would return to the house the day after.The trainees immediately started to prepare a meal, and Runaan\u2014who\u2019d already grown close to the kids\u2014ate with them.While Raon was eating dinner on his own, Rimmer came up to him.\u201cGood job.\u201dHolding the bowl full of solid ingredients, Rimmer sat down next to him.\u201cWell, that was the mission.\u201d\u201cThere are countless people that can\u2019t complete a mission despite being qualified as swordsmen, so you did really great in comparison. You could\u2019ve done better in some aspects, though.\u201dRimmer spooned the soup and ate it. Murmuring that it tasted bad, he put the bowl aside.\u201cBandits aren\u2019t easy opponents like in the stories. They can utilize the mountain as well as the elves, and their savagery doesn\u2019t lose to orcs. They are even worse if they belong to or are aiming to join the South-North Union.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRaon nodded silently.\u201cThe decision to save the children worked out, but if they had a warrior above the level of Expert, you and Runaan would\u2019ve died instead.\u201d\u201cSo, you were watching us after all.\u201d\u201cWell, it just happened.\u201dRimmer grinned and continued.\u201cYou did great today. However, in the future you should decide whether you should act alone or call the other people after confirming the enemies\u2019 number and might, as well as the presence of and the state of the hostages. Since you are the top trainee, you should improve your decision-making ability.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong. Raon had countless experiences in killing, but he was a bit lacking since it was the first time that he had to rescue hostages.Since he was going to have allies with him more often than he\u2019d be alone while he was with Zieghart, it was important to improve his decision making accordingly.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel dejected. Since you and Runaan chose the best course of action, you will grow up splendidly in the future.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRimmer put his thumbs up. Raon silently closed his eyes and accepted his compliment.\u201cAh, and those children will be brought to the house. Apparently, they have nowhere to go since their entire family is dead.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dRaon scratched the ground. He felt bitter oddly, despite it being a stranger\u2019s business.\u201cSince they got close to Runaan, I\u2019m going to ask if House Sullion can take them in.\u201d\u201cThat would be nice.\u201dThe children listened to Runaan, so that seemed like a good idea.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dWhen he was about to eat the soup to calm his bitter mind, Burren\u2014who\u2019d already finished eating\u2014came up to him and opened his pouting mouth.\u201cI admit it. Today was my complete loss. You and Runaan finished the mission while I was as wrong as a broken clock. However!\u201dHe raised his trembling fist.\u201cI won\u2019t give up. I\u2019ll catch up to you one day, even if that means I have to get rid of thousands of training shoes.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dWithout even waiting for the answer, Burren turned around. He returned to the collateral trainees just like that.\u201cWhat was that?\u201dWhy training shoes?Since he couldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about, he decided to continue eating and picked up his spoon. At that moment, a snorting sound came from the wooden column to his right side. It was Martha. She was crossing her arms with a cold expression on her face.\u201cPathetic.\u201dWithout specifying who she was talking about, she went into the forest.\u201cYour life is full of trouble.\u201dRimmer grinned and put down the bowl. Despite complaining about its taste, the bowl was completely empty.\u201cWhose fault do you think that is?\u201dRaon frowned. He was the one who\u2019d stirred the trainees up by instigating an instructor. Yet he was talking like he didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201cWhose fault is it?\u201dRimmer giggled and asked back.\u201cYou need rivals to grow properly at your age. They will become trustworthy allies in the future, so get along with them.\u201dAfter saying that, he disappeared with a green wind.Rivals, huh\u2026?As soon as Rimmer left, Wrath popped out of the bracelet.The King of Essence also had six rivals. The strongest was obviously the King of Essence, but they weren\u2019t too bad\u2026\u201c......\u201dRaon sighed and piled up the empty bowls.\u2018Why are there so many crazy people around me\u2026?\u2019***Raon and the trainees returned to the house in a week. Some trainees were worried about the fact that they didn\u2019t do anything during the mission, but they were mostly happy because they could rest comfortably once again.Rumble!Zieghart\u2019s main gate, which looked like layers of steel towers, opened majestically. As the gatekeeper was letting them pass, a big man over two meters tall came out from inside. He was Illiune, the foreign minister.\u201cRunaan Sullion, Raon Zieghart.\u201dHis eyes sparkled as he called for Raon and Runaan, who were standing at the very back.\u201cThe head of house has summoned the two of you. Prepare to present yourselves at the lord\u2019s manor immediately.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been summoned?\u201dRaon furrowed his brow, looking at Runaan, who was holding the children\u2019s hands. Runaan didn\u2019t seem to know the reason either as she tilted her head.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be surprised.\u201dThe foreign minister Illiune gave a refreshing smile.\u201cAwarding the most accomplished trainees in their first mission is Zieghart\u2019s custom.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You don\u2019t need to be nervous since he must be calling you to compliment you.\u201dRimmer looked slightly excited as he nodded, murmuring that it wasn\u2019t a big deal.However, there was one thing neither Rimmer nor Illiune had mentioned.Complimenting the trainees that did well on their first mission had happened before but calling them to the lord\u2019s manor had never happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He won\u2019t say anything bad today.\u201dRimmer grinned and patted his shoulder from behind.\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan\u2019s humming could be heard next to him. Despite being nervous while rescuing the children, no trace of tension could be found when she was about to greet the head of house. She was a strange one indeed.Thud.The audience chamber\u2019s door opened with a huge noise, similar to a giant\u2019s footsteps. A powerful pressure stormed out, opening the door completely.Withstanding the pressure that was as endless as a furnace\u2019s flame, they entered the audience chamber.And Glenn was there, at the center of the threatening pressure.Like always, he was sitting on a golden throne and looking down at them.\u201cGreetings, my lord.\u201dAfter Rimmer\u2019s greetings, Raon and Runaan knelt down at the same time.\u2018Was he supposed to compliment us?\u2019Raon wrinkled his nose. The wave of energy directed at them was too fierce for it to be a compliment.\u201cStand up.\u201dGlenn\u2019s dignified voice resounded as he waved his hand.\u201cRaon Zieghart, Runaan Sullion. I heard that you did well on your first mission.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve merely done our best.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon bowed once again and Runaan copied him.\u201cI did already hear about it, but do tell me what you did.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. When we arrived at the foothold, there were four locations where the bandits could\u2019ve been hiding. Although the bandits were as strong as the beasts in the mountain, I suspected that they would\u2019ve been hiding somewhere else in order to shake off the pursuers. Therefore\u2026\u201dRaon explained everything that happened during the mission to Glenn, who didn\u2019t really look interested.He didn\u2019t nod or blink. He kept listening to the end without any reaction whatsoever, to the point that Raon felt awkward.\u201cIt\u2019s just as I heard. Wiping out the enemies and rescuing hostages in your first mission is certainly an extraordinary achievement. However.\u201dGlenn\u2019s eyes were bleak.\u201cThat was too clumsy. If you\u2019d made the slightest mistake, or if the bandits were a bit stronger, or if you hadn\u2019t coordinated as well as you did, then those children would\u2019ve died and you would\u2019ve been seriously injured.\u201dIt felt like his heavy voice was pressing upon his head.\u201cPlanning is important, especially for trainees that don\u2019t have any experience. You should only act after making multiple backup plans.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, you should\u2019ve contacted the other trainees and led them upon finding the bandits\u2019 tracks. Your experience and might are too shallow to deal with everything on your own.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dRaon lowered his head once again.\u201cHow is this a compliment?\u201dHe was sure he heard Glenn was going to compliment them, but he kept pointing out his mistakes after a small compliment in the beginning.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s a fact that you succeeded despite your methods being full of holes.\u201dWhen Glenn gestured with his chin, his butler Roenn brought a golden plate forward.\u201cI award you a bronze tablet for your accomplishment in the mission and the rescue of the children.\u201d\u201cYou did a great job.\u201dRoenn handed over the bronze tablet with a gentle smile.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon and Runaan accepted the tablet with both hands and bowed to Glenn.\u201cAh, I have something to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhat shall I do with this elixir?\u201dRaon took out the Teuton Flower that he took from the Snow Tiger leader. The flower bud, yet to blossom, was rolled up in a circle.Glenn watched the Teuton Flower for a bit, then shook his head.\u201cSince you\u2019ve acquired it, it is yours. Take it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dRaon tilted his head slightly. Since the elixir was rather rare, he didn\u2019t expect him to just give it to him.\u201cYou should leave now.\u201dHe leaned back and rested his chin in his hands, signaling that the audience was over.Raon and Runaan bowed and stepped back, leaving the audience chamber.***The audience chamber, only three people remaining inside, was filled in silence for a moment.\u201cPfft.\u201dRimmer burst into laughter, unable to bear the silence.\u201cWhy are you laughing? And why are you here when I didn\u2019t even call for you?\u201d\u201cI mean, if you wanted to hear about Raon's accomplishment from him personally, you should\u2019ve just asked him honestly. What were all those excuses?\u201dRimmer grinned, watching Glenn frown.\u2018He really isn't honest.\u2019Since he\u2019d already sent the report, Glenn was already aware of everything that had happened during the mission.Glenn was worried about his grandson, and the sight of him giving him advice while pretending to scold him was just too funny.\u201cIs this what we call a meanie grandfather?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dRimmer hid his mouth with both hands.\u201cIt looks like the head of house is also looking at Raon as a potential successor.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHis own progress is more important than taking care of the others, since he\u2019s still a trainee. But the reason you asked him to lead the trainees was in preparation for when he would challenge the throne of Zieghart, right?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn didn\u2019t respond to Rimmer\u2019s sharp remark. He was simply looking at him silently.\u201cIt looks like you really cherish Raon. You didn\u2019t even do that when you were raising the young masters\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are being too noisy.\u201d\u201cHow about being a bit more honest now? I\u2019m sure Raon would like it if you tried saying \u2018Good job, grandson. Come here so I can hug you, peekaboo\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cRimmer.\u201dGlenn\u2019s pressure grew fiercer. Not just the audience chamber, but the entirety of the lord\u2019s manor started trembling.\u201cHuff!\u201dPretending to not laugh, Rimmer moved far away.\u201cHehe.\u201dWhen Glenn\u2019s pressure was about to explode, Roenn interfered with a gentle smile.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty nice.\u201d\u201cWhat is nice?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been thirty years since I last saw you two playing around together. I haven\u2019t seen that reaction from my lord for a really long time, either\u2026\u201dRoenn\u2019s wrinkled eyes were recalling the old memories.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I knew it. Sir Roenn knows what\u2019s up.\u201dGlenn eased his pressure and Rimmer smiled once again.\u201cAh, and there was one thing Raon didn\u2019t mention.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the South-North Union?\u201d\u201cYes. Their young leader heard Raon\u2019s name and left.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d\u201cHe withdrew, facing Raon\u2019s spirit. It wasn\u2019t our territory, and since he acknowledged Raon, I didn\u2019t really want to catch him.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dGlenn snorted, but he didn\u2019t look displeased.\u201cAnd lastly, I\u2019d like you to be a bit more honest with your grandson. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always honest with everyone.\u201d\u201cNo way. If you were honest, you would\u2019ve been like this.\u201dRimmer cleared his throat, folding his hands behind his back like an actor.\u201cRaon. I\u2019m so proud that you\u2019ve accomplished your mission so well. My grandson, give your grandpa a kiss. This much is enough to make Raon happy, yourself happy and even me happy as I watch you! Everyone would be happy!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGlenn sighed heavily and stood up from the chair. An energy wave threatening enough to destroy the world filled the audience chamber.\u201cI-I\u2019ll be leaving then. I gotta drink, I mean, an important appointment.\u201dRimmer walked backward while rubbing the back of his head and left the audience chamber.\u201cTsk, he\u2019s getting smugger every time.\u201dGlenn clicked his tongue and lowered his hand.\u201cI still liked it. It reminded me of when you were commanding the continent together.\u201dRoenn smiled lightly, moving to the side.\u201cHmph.\u201dWithout saying anything, Glenn crossed his arms and leaned his back.\u201cSince all this seems to be thanks to the young master Raon, I took a liking to him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine to like him on the inside, but you should treat everyone equally, whether they are successors or other children.\u201d\u201cYou are absolutely right.\u201dRoenn bowed, smiling. As he raised his head, he saw Glenn. Despite what he said, the corners of his mouth were higher than usual.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon headed to the annex building as soon as he left the lord\u2019s manor.He considered training right away, but he figured relieving Sylvia and the maids, who must\u2019ve been worried, came first.When he reached the annex building, loud noise was coming from inside.\u2018That\u2019s how it should be around here.\u2019The annex building was always noisy and active. He was already feeling at ease.Raon opened the annex building\u2019s door brightly.\u201cHuh?\u201dHis eyes were wide. There was somebody he\u2019d never expected in the annex building.\u201cDorian?\u201dDorian was standing in the lobby, and Sylvia, Helen, and the other maids were surrounding him.\u201cOh, is the young master back?\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cAh, madam asked me to come by after the mission and tell her about what happened.\u201d\u201cTh-then\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I told her everything about the young master Raon\u2019s touching endeavor.\u201dDorian wiped his tears away.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cAh, our young master really did.\u201dThe maids were also wiping their tears. It seemed he\u2019d really told them everything.\u2018Oh, shit\u2026\u2019He was going to fudge over it to avoid worrying Sylvia and Helen. He\u2019d never expected them to contact him first.\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201dSylvia and Helen approached him at the same time, with their hands on their hips.\u201cAh, that wasn\u2019t my intenti\u2026\u201d\u201cGood job!\u201dAs he was about to give excuses, Sylvia hugged him and patted his back.\u201cHuh?\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes widened at the unexpected reaction.\u201cDid you really think I was going to scold you for that?\u201d\u201cYou keep telling me to be careful.\u201d\u201cThe reason the Zieghart\u2019s ancestors wielded their swords was to protect the weak. Since then, Zieghart has always been protecting the weak and those living in their domain.\u201dSylvia\u2019s red eyes glittered like rubies.\u201cI also wanted to become a swordsman with the old Zieghart\u2019s spirit, so there\u2019s no way I would scold you for saving the hostages and risking your life.\u201dShe grabbed his hand tightly. He felt like his exhaustion was being wiped away by her warmth.\u201cMom is really proud of you.\u201d\u201cMhm!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so true!\u201d\u201cI gotta visit the main building tomorrow. I\u2019ll boast about this to everyone!\u201dSylvia hugged him once again, Helen and the maids nodded with teary eyes.\u2018I don\u2019t get it.\u2019Raon sighed.\u2018Emotions are really difficult to understand.\u2019However, he didn\u2019t dislike their warmth.\u2018Anyway, that damn Dorian.\u2019He turned his head, looking for Dorian, but he was nowhere to be seen.That coward ran away a long time ago.\u2018Damn it!\u2019He was a light footed one for sure.***After eating in the annex building, Raon changed his clothes and went to the fifth training ground. Sylvia and Helen were telling him to rest for the day, but he wanted to move his body.\u201cIs that him?\u201d\u201cYes. Raon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cHis build isn\u2019t that great, and his pressure is weak\u2026\u201d\u201cBut he really wiped out the bandits on his own.\u201d\u201cI guess, since Rimmer doesn\u2019t lie, although he sometimes exaggerates.\u201dHe could feel the swordsman's blatant gazes while walking to the training ground. It seemed the news about the mission had already spread throughout the house.\u2018Seriously, that man\u2026\u2019He sighed, since it was obviously the red-haired elf\u2019s doing.\u201cWiping out thirty bandits, including a mid-high tier Sword User, is an extraordinary achievement.\u201d\u201cThere were rumors about him being at his deathbed from his illness, so I guess he was lucky.\u201dHe felt awkward hearing compliments for the first time when he was used to being insulted or looked down on.However, his mood and mind were for him to decide. He didn\u2019t need to care about what others said.Raon entered the fifth training ground while listening to the swordsmen without paying much attention. Naturally, it was empty.He warmed up and unsheathed his sword from his waist. Slowly lifting it, he put it in front of his energy center. Maintaining the middle posture, he recalled his last fight.\u2018I was a bit slow.\u2019The bandits got in his way, but he could\u2019ve beheaded the Snow Tiger leader from the beginning. Because he was too concerned about the children and the other bandits, he reacted too slowly, ending up wasting a lot of time.The important part of a real battle was how he used his abilities. That was why it was safe to say that he\u2019d failed.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Since he was aware of that fact\u2026Since he knew what the problem was, and how to solve it, he could fix it.\u2018My aura and body aren\u2019t on the same page.\u2019His body moved exactly the way he wanted, but his aura was slightly late.It was necessary that his aura and body moved at the same time, like the two blades of a pair of scissors.Haa.Raon calmed his breathing and slowly brandished his sword. The aura emanating from his energy center followed the sword. Despite being a slow movement, the space was mercilessly split apart.Even though he didn\u2019t move that much, Raon\u2019s back grew wet with perspiration. The slow movement required even more strength.Raon swung his sword slowly until the energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was exhausted.Once his aura was exhausted, he went to the cultivation room to replenish it. Then he went out to swing his sword once again. As such, the first day of his return was wet with sweat.***A small pub in the back alley of Zieghart\u2019s domain.The pub should\u2019ve been filled with different people\u2019s voices, yet only one man\u2019s voice could be heard.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s how my students saved the children that were tied up by the bandits. The bandit boss was using an aura in his saber, but Raon split it in half!\u201dThe red-haired elf was telling Raon and Runaan\u2019s story, standing on the table as if he was giving a speech. Judging from the way his face turned red, he was completely drunk.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cDid you finally find your aptitude, Rimmer? You taught them really well.\u201d\u201cNo way, he just happened to meet good students.\u201d\u201cI guess. It\u2019s hard to imagine that elf as a good teacher.\u201dThe giggling people didn\u2019t even look like swordsmen. They seemed to be average citizens.\u201cIt\u2019s both. Both! My students are the best among the current Zieghart\u2019s trainees. No, they are the best among the six Kings!\u201dRimmer grinned and poured the beer in his mouth. Some of them agreed with what he said, and others thought the sixth training ground and the other groups were just as good. The two camps started arguing soon enough.\u201cHey, stop fighting and pay me since you heard a great story. I lost everything from betting on that fifth horse, so I need to take my revenge\u2026\u201dAs he was putting down his empty beer glass and frowning, a gold coin fell on the table.\u201cHuh?\u201dRimmer raised his head after watching the gold coin for a while.With a tough face and broad shoulders, the man looked like a general on a battlefield. It was the sixth training ground\u2019s head instructor, Metun.\u201cMetun? It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dMetun slowly nodded.\u201cAnyway, thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh, can you let me go now?\u201dHe tried picking up the gold coin Metun placed on the table, but he couldn\u2019t take it because of his finger.\u201cCan you take responsibility for what you just said?\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cThat the fifth training ground is the best among Zieghart\u2019s trainees.\u201d\u201cOf course, my students are the best.\u201d\u201cYou like betting, if I remember correctly.\u201dMetun\u2019s eyes were heating up.\u201cShall we make a bet?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cA bet?\u201dRimmer furrowed his brows, looking Metun up and down.\u201cWhat kind of bet do you wanna make so suddenly?\u201d\u201cA bet to prove that the fifth training ground is really the best among Zieghart\u2019s trainees.\u201d\u201cAh, you wanna bang out?\u201d\u201cStop talking so vulgarly as a Zieghart instructor.\u201d\u201cFighting and banging out, it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s just more intuitive.\u201dRimmer grinned and finished drinking his beer. Metun remained stiff, like a stone statue.Even though they were both head instructors, their personalities were the complete opposite.\u201cOh, are Rimmer and Metun fighting each other?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not them, but they\u2019re making their students fight!\u201d\u201cThen the fifth and sixth training ground? That\u2019s huge!\u201dThe people in the pub all stood up and gathered around Rimmer and Metun.\u201cI\u2019m betting my entire fortune in Metun!\u201d\u201cHell no, Rimmer\u2019s going to win this one! Martha, Burren, Runaan, and there\u2019s also Raon, who won against those three!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The sixth training ground has many collaterals, but there\u2019s no members of the direct line. It\u2019s pretty obvious the fifth training ground is going to win!\u201d\u201cYour information is trash.\u00a0Trash. Do you really not know that Sir Kein joined the sixth training ground recently?\u201dHearing that a member of the direct line had joined them, everyone looked at him.\u201cHuh? Wasn\u2019t he injured in a mission?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already been a year and six months, dummy.\u201d\u201cOh, then it\u2019s hard to tell. Sir Kein was famous for his talent, especially his senses and the purity of his aura.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just hard to tell, but the sixth training ground has the advantage. Sir Kein and the collaterals that follow him are already sixteen years old.\u201d\u201cThis is interesting!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s gamble!\u201dPeople in the pub started taking out their money while shouting the fifth and sixth training ground\u2019s names, as if the bet was already established.\u201cWow, I\u2019m going to get beaten to death if I refuse.\u201dRimmer grinned. Despite what he said, he looked like he was enjoying it.Metun\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. It seemed he\u2019d already expected that to happen.\u201cBut why do you want to bang out all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not banging out\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind the details.\u201d\u201cDo you really not know?\u201d\u201cIs it because of the Owen Kingdom?\u201dRimmer raised his beer glass while scratching his chin.\u201cYes. Because the Owen Kingdom only asked for a spar at the fifth training ground after watching the sixth training ground, the children\u2019s pride was trampled.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s because they\u2019ve been slacking.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. It was because the trainees hadn\u2019t been doing their best, and I was the same. However, it\u2019s different now.\u201dMetun continued, watching Rimmer\u2019s fuzzy eyes.\u201cEver since Kein Zieghart transferred five months ago, the sixth training ground has changed. Everyone came out during the daybreak and trained until night, and we even passed Hell Week recently.\u201d\u201cEeh? Hell Week?\u201dRimmer\u2019s jaw dropped.\u201cYes, there wasn\u2019t a single drop out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dHell Week was part of Zieghart\u2019s training, famous for its difficulty. There were dropouts among the regular swordsmen, it was pretty amazing that every trainee managed to pass.\u201cI thought it was about time to teach them the feeling of accomplishment.\u201d\u201cAnd you are going to use the fifth training ground as the sacrificial lamb?\u201d\u201c......\u201dMetun answered the question with his silence.\u201cI like it.\u201dRimmer grinned and tapped the table.\u201cWhat about the method? Is it going to be one-on-one spars?\u201d\u201cNo, we can\u2019t win against the fifth training ground yet with one-on-on spars.\u201dMetun shook his head.\u201cHmm? Then how do you wanna fight?\u201d\u201cOne-on-one isn\u2019t the only way.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dRimmer grinned and tapped the table.\u201cIs it a team battle?\u201d\u201cYes. The fifth training ground has forty-three people, so we will also prepare forty-three people. Let\u2019s decide on a location and make them fight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be difficult to call it an all-out war. I guess it\u2019d be a local war.\u201dMurmuring that it would be good, he touched once again the gold coin that Metun had put down.\u201cBut I have a suggestion.\u201d\u201cSuggestion?\u201d\u201cSixth training ground has over twice as many people as us, right?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s better to give more opportunities. Bring sixty people.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s fight with forty-three of us and sixty from there.\u201d\u201cAre you looking down on us?\u201dMetun\u2019s pressure flared up like dry straws. The table started trembling.\u201cI\u2019m not looking down on you, I\u2019m telling you the truth. You gotta admit they lack in power and experience.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cAnd we have more direct line, vassal family, and upper collaterals. Nobody\u2019s going to point their fingers at you for fighting with sixty people.\u201dAfter considering it for a bit, Metun nodded.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cAnd you decide the date and location.\u201d\u201cI do? What are you gonna do if I trick you\u2026?\u201dMetun\u2019s serious eyes wavered for the first time.\u201cI know you aren\u2019t the type to cheat with something like this.\u201dMetun\u2019s strength left the hand on the gold coin, and Rimmer took it without missing the opportunity.\u201cBut you are mistaken about one thing.\u201dMetun turned his head around after taking his hand off from the gold coin.\u201cMistake?\u201d\u201cKein Zieghart cultivated his aura and trained his senses every day during the year and half period where he couldn\u2019t move his body from his injury.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHis senses and amount of aura doesn\u2019t lose to a regular swordsman.\u201dHe confidently looked upon Rimmer.\u201cYou\u2019d better prepare thoroughly. Because Kein might wipe them out all by himself. This is the down payment for the bet.\u201dMetun took out a gold coin pouch from his chest, placed it in front of Rimmer, then left the pub.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cCan we also spectate?\u201d\u201cOpen the gambling place already! I\u2019m betting my entire fortune on the sixth training ground!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m betting on the fifth training ground!\u201d\u201cYou are talking big with your meager fortune. I\u2019m betting my house!\u201dOnce the bet was established, the pub became so messy that the roof seemed to throb.\u201cHmm.\u201dTapping on the gold coin pouch, Rimmer smiled.\u201cFree money is great.\u201dHe looked calm, as if he already knew it was coming.\u201cThen, shall I go to the gambling house?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Dim daybreak, before sunrise.At the annex building\u2019s dark, empty plot, Raon was sitting with his eyes closed. A red haze, thinner than leaf, was shimmering on his shoulders.Opposed to the heated sun rising up, the red energy coming from Raon\u2019s body gradually subsided, =eventually disappearing completely.Raon opened his eyes.Blink.Like the sun rising in the sky, his red eyes flared up with an intense heat.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dOnce Raon exhaled the remaining impurity from his body, his burning eyes returned to normal.\u2018Time really flows quickly.\u2019He stood up, watching the sun slowly rise.Three days had already passed since he had returned from his first mission.Thanks to training for those three days, his body and aura were somewhat synchronized.Clang!After spinning his wrist and ankle, Raon drew his sword. Using the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, he practiced the 'Star-Combining Sword' from beginning to end.Aura was following behind his body, just like a shadow. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it had significantly improved compared to three days ago.\u2018Let\u2019s leave it here for now.\u2019After all, it was something to work towards for the rest of his life.Complete synchronization between body and aura wasn\u2019t something that could be done in a span of a few days.Since it would lead to the \u2018Sword-Body Unification\u2019, he needed to train constantly.After practicing Zieghart\u2019s basic swordsmanship from the beginning to the end, Raon sheathed his sword.When he looked up at the sky, the sun had risen pretty high.\u2018I\u2019m a bit late.\u2019Daybreak\u2019s personal training time was about to end. He needed to arrive at the training ground before the regular morning training started.Raon changed his sweat-drenched clothes and ran towards the fifth training ground. As he was about to open the door and enter, the trainees' voices could be heard from inside.\u201cWhy is he not here? This is so unusual.\u201d\u201cSince he completed the mission on his own, he must not feel the need for the daybreak training anymore.\u201d\u201cTsk, anyone could\u2019ve done it in his place.\u201d\u201cI know right? It was just a bandit, after all. They said there was an aura user, but how strong a bandit can possibly be? He just got lucky.\u201dHe could tell from the voice alone. They were collateral trainees, those that parted from Burren, unable to keep up with his changes.\u2018Pathetic.\u2019Raon clicked his tongue. The loser\u2019s chatter wasn\u2019t worth his attention, since they were going to avoid his gaze and run away the moment he entered.\u2018But the training ground is a bit cold.\u2019As he was about to enter, feeling the unusual temperature of the training ground, a familiar voice could be heard.\u201cPathetic.\u201dIt was Burren\u2019s voice. The elegant sound of footsteps stopped in front of the trainees.\u201cAnyone could\u2019ve done it? Then, did you manage to find the bandits\u2019 tracks back then? Or did you manage to rescue the children? I guess you must\u2019ve at least killed a bandit?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cSir Burren, we were just k-kidding\u2026\u201dThe trainees didn\u2019t know what to say and just mumbled.\u201cJealousy is an emotion that anyone can have. However, the moment you speak it out aloud, you become the most disgraceful human. I know all about it because I\u2019ve tried it already. Get a grip!\u201dThud!As soon as Burren finished talking, someone jumped down from a tree.\u201cHah, I would have broken your skulls if he wasn\u2019t there.\u201dIt was Martha. Her angry voice could be heard near the trainees.\u201cKnow your place. If you\u2019d met the bandit leader back then, he would\u2019ve killed your punk asses already, or an instructor watching over you would\u2019ve drug you out like a dog.\u201d\u201cL-Lady Martha\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you do during the break after the mission? You must\u2019ve been taking it easy since you felt like you needed some rest after the mission. You probably didn\u2019t even train.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe trainees could only lick their lips because Martha had nailed it.\u201cThat damn bastard, the one that single handedly completed the mission, came out to the training ground and practiced while you were sound asleep in your homes. He even did that on the day he returned.\u201d\u201cR-really?\u201d\u201cAsk him yourself if you can\u2019t believe it.\u201dMartha smiled coldly and jeered at the trainees.\u201cYou know too well about what he did. Did you stalk him?\u201d\u201cWhat? What the hell is this son of a bitch saying!\u201dMartha punched the wall at Burren\u2019s joke.\u201cAm I right? How do you know if you didn\u2019t see him yourself?\u201d\u201cI think shackling that mouth of yours would allow me to know.\u201dBurren and Martha started exuding pressure like they were about to start a fight.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon felt an unknown emotion, similar to tapping his chest with a finger, and opened the training ground\u2019s door.The noisy and bustling training ground fell silent. Burren and Martha, who were about to fight, turned their heads.\u201cRaon.\u201dAs he was watching those two, Runaan approached him with shining silver eyes. White frost was shimmering from her shoulder.\u2018It was her.\u2019He was wondering why the training ground was cold, but apparently it was because Runaan was emitting a serious amount of frost.\u201cYou must be out of your mind because you completed a mission on your own. You\u2019re even late for daybreak training!\u201dDespite standing up for him earlier, Martha was now taunting him.\u201cI trained at home, don\u2019t worry.\u201dRaon simply answered, then went to the center.\u201cThe regular training starts soon. Everyone, line up!\u201dThe trainees gathered behind Raon with slightly dissatisfied expressions.\u201cWarm up until training begins.\u201dAn nearly invisible,\u00a0faint smile appeared around Raon\u2019s mouth as he turned his head and told them to warm up.***Two months had passed since they completed their first mission.People were looking at Raon differently, but he only focused on the synergy between the 'Star-Combining Sword' and \u2018River Footwork\u2019, not caring about anything else.This is boring. How can you keep repeating the swordsmanship and footwork that you\u2019ve already learned? Does boredom not exist in you?\u2018Of course not.\u2019Raon chuckled.\u2018I\u2019m bearing with it since it's important training.\u2019Everyone knew that the basics were important, but most people made the mistake of focusing on advanced techniques, giving up on basic training.The reason was simple.Competition.\u2018Because it feels like I\u2019m falling behind.\u2019While one was repeating the plain sword technique and footwork, if others were using the sword aura and creating the sword wind, one would naturally be dispirited and uneasy.\u2018And it's seriously boring.\u2019The basic swordsmanship and footwork were simple and plain. Even a trainee with average talent could learn the form in a single week.Nobody would\u2019ve found it fun to keep practicing that for several months, or years, over and over.Raon was the same. Repeating the basic swordsmanship and footwork was painful to him, as well.\u2018But I have to do it.\u2019Diligently training the basics was like making ladders on a cliff.Those who climbed with their hands and feet would advance faster, for instance, but the one with a ladder would become faster and reach a higher place in the future.Since he was confident in his patience more than anyone in the world, Raon kept practicing his basic swordsmanship, footwork, and the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 during the personal training time.\u201cWow, doesn\u2019t he ever get bored?\u201d\u201cHow can he keep repeating the 'Star-Combining Sword' over and over?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s crazy. Really crazy\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t live like that. I really can\u2019t.\u201dThe trainees were amazed at Raon, who kept repeating that basic technique. It wasn\u2019t mockery or jeering, they were simply amazed.\u201cI know, right? How is he just repeating that? I think he\u2019s probably gone crazy.\u201dThe trainees turned around, hearing a pleasant voice.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cI-instructor!\u201d\u201cHow come you\u2019re here so early?\u201d\u201cHello.\u201dThe head instructor Rimmer grinned and waved his hand.\u201cBasics being boring is a fact, but he is going to reach higher. I\u2019ve never seen anyone not reach the high ground among the swordsmen that have worked hard on their basics.\u201dAfter saying that, he went up to the platform.\u201cEveryone, attention!\u201dRimmer clapped his hands and drew everyone\u2019s attention. The trainees stopped their personal training and ran up to him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dBurren raised his hand. He was tilting his head, curious about why he came out early during the daybreak independent training time.\u201cAh, I should\u2019ve told you about it before, but I forgot.\u201d\u201cPardon? You forgot?\u201d\u201cWhat did you forget again?\u201dThe trainees asked lightheartedly, believing it must not have been a big deal. However, his response surpassed their expectations by far.\u201cWe are going to beat up those sixth training ground guys.\u201d\u201cBeat up? Sixth training ground? Are you perhaps saying that we are going to spar with them?\u201d\u201cRather than spar, it\u2019s more like an all-out war. Forty-three of you and sixty of them will be fighting at once.\u201d\u201cWhen is it?\u201dBurren\u2019s face stiffened like a tree, and the other trainees also swallowed.Enjoying those expressions, Rimmer grinned.\u201cTomorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The story originated from a pub two months before, but he shrugged it off as a groundless rumor since nothing happened since then.Yet he was told it was tomorrow. Tomorrow!Burren thought he had a problem with his ears. Because it was simply unimaginable that he would\u2019ve actually heard that.\u201cInstructor.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cDid you just say it was tomorrow?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cStop copying Runaan. Please tell me clearly. Is it really tomorrow?\u201d\u201cArgh. I told you, yes.\u201dRimmer nodded immediately. His shameless face deserved a beating.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a spar, but an all-out war. Yet it\u2019s tomorrow?\u201d\u201cSince there\u2019s not that many people involved, you should consider it as a local war instead of an all-out war\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about!\u201dBurren stomped on the ground.\u201cTomorrow is the day of the battle, and you just told us about it now. How could you even do that? Was the rumor from the pub really true?\u201d\u201cOh, so you knew about it. That story was about me and Metun.\u201d\u201cGod damn it!\u201dOne-on-one spars would\u2019ve been a different story, but an all-out battle was a competition of pride. Announcing such an important matter the day before was so preposterous that he couldn\u2019t close his mouth.\u201cHaaa, that\u2019s why you\u2019re called novices.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue, squatting on the ground.\u201cDoes a war or a battle start after politely greeting each other with a \u2018Nice to meet you, we will start fighting you. Be careful!\u2019? No, it doesn't. Most battles start suddenly, from an unexpected situation.\u201dHis sharp pressure overwhelmed the surroundings, despite his shabby posture.\u201cOnce a war starts, you have to run out to participate whether you are eating, sleeping, or taking a shit. In a situation where you don\u2019t even know who the enemies are or how many of them there are, you have to draw your sword and fight. I\u2019m giving you plenty of time to prepare by telling you a day before.\u201d\u201cUhh!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dBurren and the trainees shut their mouths, unable to retort.\u2018He\u2019s right.\u2019Raon nodded.\u2018Most missions are sudden.\u2019Assassination was the same.Naturally, assassination was a lot more likely to succeed when the target was outside, rather than in their home.Devising a plan and starting to move once the target left the house was a common occurrence.Improvising a plan of action was an indispensable quality of an assassin.\u201cMoreover, the sixth training ground was also informed last night. That\u2019s not much different from you.\u201d\u201cY-you should\u2019ve said that earlier.\u201d\u201cYou got angry before I even explained. It was my first time seeing you that angry.\u201dRimmer giggled.\u201cUgh! I\u2019m sorry.\u201dBurren lowered his head, ears completely red. It looked like he was embarrassed.\u201cSince I think everyone understands now, I\u2019m going to start the explanation.\u201dRimmer stood up, his hands behind his back. It seemed like he was trying to look dignified, but he didn\u2019t really.\u201cThe battle starts tomorrow at 6 am. The forty-three of us will be participating, and they will have sixty people. The victory is\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, why are there sixty of them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s almost 1.5 times our numbers\u2026\u201dThe trainees\u2019 throats tightened upon hearing that the sixth training ground had a lot more people.\u201cI told you already. A war isn\u2019t something you fight with equal numbers. Are you going to complain once you meet a more numerous enemy? Say that it was unfair for you? You aren\u2019t!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dThe trainees tilted their heads and went back to their positions. They felt like they were being played by Rimmer.\u201cI\u2019m going to start explaining again. The forty-three of us and the sixty of them will start moving at the same time. The victory goes to the team that incapacitates all the enemies or seizes the flag in the opposite camp. It\u2019s simpler than spars in some ways.\u201dMurmuring that it was too easy, he told them to be thankful that he didn\u2019t tell them about it the next morning.\u201cHmm\u2026 Now that I think about it, it doesn\u2019t seem too hard.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess\u2026 Since the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees are mostly the dropouts from here, there\u2019s no members of the direct line among them either.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? Sir Kein joined the sixth training ground a few months ago.\u201d\u201cSir K-Kein Zieghart is a whole two years older than us! How can we win against him?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He was seriously injured and was bedridden for an entire year. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s even fully recovered yet.\u201d\u201cOh, then that\u2019s a different story.\u201dThe trainees breathed a sigh of relief, hearing that he hadn\u2019t completely recovered yet.\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dBurren shook his head.\u201cKein Zieghart has already fully recovered from his injuries. Because he continued training his aura and senses, his might is currently at that of an advanced level Sword User.\u201d\u201cA-advanced level Sword User?\u201dThe trainees' faces went pale upon hearing it.\u201cHmph. So what? Chicken out if you are scared. I\u2019ll take care of the Kein guy or whatever.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not scared. I\u2019m just telling them the information. And you can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\u201cHaah?\u201dThe trainees\u2019 pale faces recovered upon seeing Martha and Burren\u2019s argument.\u201cWe also have Sir Burren, Lady Martha, and Lady Runaan. Well, we also have Raon.\u201d\u201cHonestly, I feel like we are going to win without too much difficulty. Those two can handle Sir Kein, and we can deal with the rest.\u201d\u201cWe can do it. We\u2019ve won against the Owen Kingdom\u2019s knights, and we\u2019ve also completed a mission.\u201dThe trainees smiled, saying that the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees were a piece of cake.\u201cHmm\u2026 You\u2019ll pay dearly if you look down on them too much.\u201dRimmer smiled frighteningly.\u201cThere\u2019s a training called Hell Week that highly improves the swordsman's abilities. The sixth training ground\u2019s trainees have completed Hell Week without a single dropout. And that was thanks to you guys.\u201d\u201cThanks to us?\u201d\u201cBecause the fifth training ground has been getting the most attention from the house. Their eyes are blazing with the desire to catch up to you. If you look down on them, then you will just end up losing before doing anything.\u201dHe was seriously advising them after a long time.\u201cNo way! Every day has been a Hell week for us.\u201d\u201cThey are dropouts from here. They can\u2019t have gotten that strong. We are born with different talents, after all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ve never lost or failed so far.\u201d\u201cAs long as Sir Kein is stopped, we can win for sure!\u201dThe trainees didn\u2019t lose their arrogance despite hearing his advice. They looked even more motivated, instead.\u201cThat\u2019s some nice confidence.\u201dRimmer smirked and nodded. His smile seemed to say that he didn\u2019t care if they ended up losing like that.\u201cFinally, the all-out war is like a small warfare. Which means that the leader\u2019s orders are of primordial importance. Everyone should follow Raon\u2019s advice tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe trainees that usually followed Raon answered immediately, and those who followed Burren or Runaan responded a little bit later.\u2018That\u2019s annoying.\u2019Raon frowned. Defeating the sixth training ground wasn\u2019t a big deal, but controlling the trainees was bothersome.\u201cToday\u2019s training is free. You can create a plan here or just keep training to prepare for the incoming battle.\u201dRimmer returned with the usual light and loafing atmosphere.\u201cHead instructor, you didn\u2019t tell us the most important thing.\u201dBurren raised his hand.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhere is the battle going to take place?\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands.\u201cThe Northern Grave Mountain over there, behind the main building.\u201dHe gave a sly smile to Raon. It felt like he was saying, \u2018You know the Northern Grave Mountain well enough, I\u2019ll leave the rest to you.\u2019\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon shook his head. It looked like Rimmer had bet on their side\u2019s victory.Betting on the fifth training ground after creating the worst circumstance for them, he really was a funny man, or rather, elf.\u2018That\u2019s why he gets ruined every time.\u2019There was a reason he was losing money in gambling houses or racetracks all the time.\u201cI\u2019ll be going then.\u201dRimmer waved his hand like a kid on a picnic and left the training ground.\u201cLine up.\u201dRaon sighed and gathered the trainees at the center.\u201cWe are going to devise a plan now, in preparation for the team battle tomorrow. Anyone have information about the sixth training ground?\u201d\u201cI-I know a bit about them.\u201dDorian, who had hand tremor syndrome, gulped.\u201cAs everybody knows, the current top trainee of the sixth training ground is Sir Kein Zieghart. He is sixteen years old, which is two years older than us, but he\u2019d been bedridden for an entire year from a serious injury he got on a mission. He has recovered.\u201d\u201cInjury, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cLike you heard before, his might is at the level of an advanced level Sword User, and he is rather popular since every trainee in the sixth training ground follows him. There are three collaterals that are exceptionally strong\u2026\u201dAs expected of someone that had lots of connections, he kept telling them about the sixth training ground.\u201cI guess we don\u2019t even need a plan if that\u2019s all they have.\u201d\u201cI knew it. We can ignore the rest except for Sir Kein.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Two people among the four strongest should deal with Sir Kein, and we can wipe out the rest.\u201dThe trainees giggled and clamored that they didn\u2019t even need a plan.\u201cCertainly, we are going to win without much difficulty as long as Sir Kein is dealt with.\u201dBurren also suggested moving individually. It seemed he also didn\u2019t think they could lose.\u201cFuck the plan. There\u2019s no need to wreck your brain over it when you can just crush them with power. Just leave it to me and I\u2019ll wipe them all out on my own.\u201dMartha raised her clenched fist.It seemed they wanted to display their abilities in the upcoming battle, since they hadn\u2019t done anything in the mission two months ago.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAfter hearing everyone\u2019s opinion, Raon nodded.\u201cTo summarize, since we are a lot stronger than them, we don\u2019t need anything like a plan or a strategy. We can just wipe them out. We just need to deal with Kein somehow, am I right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe are going to win regardless.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s finish it in the morning so we can eat lunch afterwards.\u201dThe trainees smiled as if they\u2019d already won. The only silent ones were Runaan like always, and Dorian who\u2019d finished saying everything he\u2019d wanted.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do that.\u201dAfter looking around the trainees, he nodded.\u201cOh, that\u2019s cool for once.\u201d\u201cThen is it time for the personal training?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a bet about how many people you are going to defeat tomorrow.\u201dThe trainees moved out for the individual training while laughing.What a bunch of idiots.\u2018Indeed.\u2019Raon nodded with a cold gaze.\u2018They don\u2019t realize at all how scary the people who are chasing after them are.\u2019It looked like they\u2019d only learn after paying dearly for it, just like Rimmer had mentioned.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Sixth Training Ground.The Same Day.Around one hundred trainees, covered in dust from head to toe, were gathered at the center.\u201cEvery single one of you has completed Hell Week, which has more than a 70% dropout rate.\u201dThe trainees straightened their backs when they heard the sixth training ground\u2019s head instructor\u2019s dignified voice.\u201cAnd that was your choice. Do you remember the reason why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the fifth training ground!\u201dThe trainees shouted at once. The voice was loud enough to shake the sixth training ground, which was bigger than the fifth training ground.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The fifth training ground has been getting the most attention from the house, and the Owen Kingdom that looked down on you requested a spar with them. Your choice was made in order to defeat them.\u201dMetun examined the trainees one by one. His eyes were stronger than ever.\u201cAnd the time has come. After all the time you\u2019ve spent getting no attention whatsoever, you finally got the opportunity to defeat the fifth training ground.\u201dAs his voice resounded throughout the training ground, the trainees\u2019 eyes shone.\u201cEven if it\u2019s a forty-three versus sixty battle, everyone in the house will expect their victory. However, I believe the odds are even. Show them what you\u2019ve been accumulating so far!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees shouted their throats off.\u201cKein Zieghart.\u201dMetun called the only member of the direct line in the sixth training ground forward. A blond, blue-eyed boy that was standing at the center stepped up.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u201cConsider it done.\u201dKein bowed confidently.\u201cI\u2019ll show everyone that the sixth training ground is stronger than the fifth training ground.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201dMetun shook his head slightly.\u201cAs the sixth training ground\u2019s top trainee, you have to defeat Raon Zieghart, who is the fifth training ground\u2019s top trainee.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you not confident?\u201d\u201cYes, I am.\u201dKein\u2019s eyes glowed fiercely.\u201cI just didn\u2019t answer since it was obvious. That guy can\u2019t win against me. I am stronger than him.\u201d\u201cThat's great confidence.\u201dMetun nodded in satisfaction.\u201cKein isn\u2019t the only one. Everyone should do their best, so their efforts so far won't be in vain.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe light didn\u2019t turn off until late at night in the sixth training ground.***\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon nodded, reading the Northern Grave Mountain\u2019s map, checking out the location the battle was going to take place.\u2018I know all of those places.\u2019Since he\u2019d been training by running around the mountain ever since he followed Rimmer there, he was well aware of the geography. He had a huge geographic advantage compared to the sixth training ground.\u2018However\u2026\u2019The others were in a bad state.The trainees were too carried away by their continued victories and successes.Even though some of that stuff was achieved by Raon alone, the trainees mistakenly believed that they\u2019d gotten stronger by having been with him.\u2018Well, they are strong.\u2019It was a fact that the trainees were stronger than the other swordsmen or knights of their age, thanks to Rimmer\u2019s training method. However, the difference wasn\u2019t overwhelming, and they couldn\u2019t afford to look down on others.Since children grow up quickly when they are unnoticed, if they were careless, they could end up losing.All that\u2019s because they have never experienced actual battle. They will only learn after getting almost killed by someone weaker than them.Wrath sneered, realizing Raon\u2019s line of thoughts.Those idiots remind me of devildom back then. The King of Essence plucked out the horns of a high devil that was acting arrogantly\u2026\u201cAh, there he goes again.\u201dThe King of Essence is telling you a story that will become your flesh and blood, yet you interrupt me\u2026\u201cYes, yes.\u201dArrrgh! Raon Zieghart!Raon shook his hand and laid on his bed. He blocked his hearing and closed his eyes.Well, he wasn\u2019t wrong.Teaching them that they weren\u2019t actually special by letting them experience defeat wasn\u2019t too bad.Rimmer must\u2019ve been aiming for that, too. Of course, he must\u2019ve wanted them to win after almost losing, instead of actually losing.\u2018Interesting.\u2019Raon smiled lightly.\u2018It\u2019s a good opportunity.\u2019It was an opportunity to show the trainees that didn\u2019t follow him yet what kind of role a leader could play.After the battle, every single trainee in the fifth training ground would follow his orders without exception.\u201cThen let\u2019s steal some information for now.\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes shone faintly, like the moon in the sky.***On the mountainside of the Northern Grave Mountain, the Next Day.Kein Zieghart and the fifty-nine trainees from the sixth training ground were gathered around a yellow flag.\u201cLastly, I\u2019ll tell you the plan.\u201dLooking at the Northern Grave Mountain\u2019s map, Kein spoke in a sharp voice.\u201cThe fifth training ground trainees are located in the west. They are still not united. Raon, Burren, Runaan, and Martha are separated into four factions.\u201dHe was aware of the fact that the fifth training ground\u2019s trainees weren\u2019t united.\u201cI\u2019m sure they will move separately. Martha is going to rush in on her own, especially. Dunn.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Kein\u2019s call, a trainee with a big build that was standing next to him nodded.\u201cAs we\u2019ve practiced, stop her and with the first group. If you induce her into a fight of endurance by alternating her opponents, you can win.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cBurren uses sharp and systematic swordsmanship. Decal!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dA trainee with long arms and legs like a monkey raised his hand.\u201cYou will take care of him. You will be able to defeat him along with the second group that has learned the Intuition Sword. Since he will be with the collaterals, bring the third group with you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLastly, Kein looked at the girl with short green hair on his right.\u201cKarin, your opponent is Runaan. She is an unpredictable one, but she seems to listen to Raon. You should stand by here, then follow my orders along with the fourth group.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cFinally, the fifth group and I will stay here and stop Raon.\u201dHolding the map, Kein Zieghart straightened his spine.\u201cHow are you going to find their locations? Nothing\u2019s going to work out if you fail to locate them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dHe smiled confidently.\u201cSince I\u2019ll use the \u2018Observing Eye\u2019.\u201dThe \u2018Observing Eye\u2019 was a special ability that could perceive an enemy's location and presence from far away. It was the perfect skill to use in a local war like that.One-on-one was a different story, but in a local war like that, information and scouting was the most important aspect. He was confident that his scouting abilities were superior to Raon\u2019s, and even the instructors\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s time to display our willpower as people that have completed Hell Week. The best training ground of Zieghart will be the sixth training ground from today onward!\u201d\u201cWooow!\u201dAt Kein\u2019s powerful voice, the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees raised a battle cry.However, there was one thing they didn\u2019t realize. Kein, with his clenched fist, and the trainees with their burning passion alike.There were red eyes looking down on them from the top of the trees.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThirty minutes before the start of the battle.The forty-two trainees from the fifth training ground, except for Raon, were gathered at the western foothold.\u201cI can\u2019t find Raon.\u201dBurren frowned and turned his head.\u201cRunaan, where\u2019s Raon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dRunaan, who was sitting under a tree, turned her head sharply. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care whether he was there or not. Her eyes were full of trust that he was going to come.Tsk.Burren clicked his tongue. He was nervous since the guy that needed to come and lead them wasn\u2019t there.\u201cCome around here for now. Get familiar with the geography for now until he arrives.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dMost of the trainees gathered around the map, but Martha was in a tree eating fruits, and Runaan didn\u2019t move from her seat.\u201cYou guys should look, at least. Over here is\u2026\u201dBurren explained the locations that the enemies could make a surprise attack or put them in danger.However, he didn\u2019t go over the map and the locations too seriously.\u2018Because we are going to win, regardless of what we do.\u2019Even though a few elites had joined the sixth training ground, they were still mostly the dropouts from the fifth training ground.The fifth training ground trainees had been training diligently so far, and they also had lots of sparring experience. There was no way they could lose.When the trainees got decently familiar with the geography and finished warming up, Raon came up to the foothold.\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cThe top trainee being late? Pathetic.\u201dRunaan ran up to him first and Martha glared at him.\u201cWhat have you been doing instead of coming here earlier and making a plan!\u201dBurren furrowed his brow while stomping on the ground, but Raon walked towards the flag\u2019s location without any reaction.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so nervous. There\u2019s no way you can lose to the sixth training ground, right?\u201dRaon grinned, sitting on a tree\u2019s trunk. It somewhat looked like he was cheering them up, but he also sounded like he was laughing at them.\u201cHmph, well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually true.\u201d\u201cHonestly, the opponents are too weak.\u201d\u201cWe could wipe them out in one fell sweep if not for Sir Kein.\u201dHowever, the trainees didn\u2019t seem to have sensed that, and nodded with overflowing confidence.\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand. Then you should do your best on your own.\u201d\u201cAre you telling us to just fight?\u201d\u201cWithout any plan?\u201d\u201cYou said you can win regardless. It would be unsightly to make a plan for such a thing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! I like it!\u201dMartha jumped down in the middle of the slightly embarrassed trainees.\u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna get your turn. I\u2019m going to decimate them on my own, so just wait here!\u201dAfter saying that, she used her aura.\u201cAre you serious?\u201dBurren furrowed his brows and stood next to Raon.\u201cBut you think so as well.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren licked his lips, hearing Raon\u2019s question. He honestly wasn't wrong.Since the sixth training ground\u2019s defensive line was going to be obliterated if himself and Martha attacked from both sides while Raon and Runaan held Kein back.\u201cYou should also move with the collaterals following you. I\u2019ll leave the rest to you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cSince Kein might come for a surprise attack, I\u2019ll protect the flag here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here as well.\u201dWhen Raon pointed at the red flag behind him, Runaan sat down under the flag.\u201cAlright, you two should be enough.\u201dBurren nodded and withdrew. He told the collaterals following him to head up with him.\u201cLet\u2019s go down, then.\u201d\u201cThose that dropped out from the temporary trainee test are a piece of cake.\u201d\u201cI guess. Do you think they\u2019ve ever even held a real sword?\u201dThe trainees from vassal families and the recommended children giggled, saying that they were heading down.Whistle!When everyone finished their preparations, the whistling sound coming from the top of the mountain signaled the start of the battle.The battle wasn\u2019t going to end until one of the flags was plucked out.\u201cWait.\u201dAs the trainees were about to run off, Raon\u2019s voice was heard. Everyone looked back.\u201cAs the top trainee, I\u2019ll give you one last order. You can do whatever you want, but if I order you to retreat because of an unfavorable situation, you should return no matter what.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that won\u2019t happen!\u201dMartha dashed to the center while breaking the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s the same here. Let\u2019s go!\u201dBurren also led the collaterals to climb up, and the recommended children and vassal family trainees ran down.\u201cRaon, can we win?\u201dRunaan asked, tapping the flag.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult like that.\u201dRaon shook his head. He closed his eyes, watching the trainees run off in three directions.They will return after getting their asses whooped.***Wham!Martha rushed to the front like a bull spotting a red cloth.\u2018I\u2019ll wipe them all out on my own.\u2019The other trainees weren\u2019t necessary. She could wipe out the weaklings from the sixth training ground on her own.After running for about five minutes and breaking through the dense bushes, nine trainees entered her sight. The number six written on a leather armor showed that they were trainees from the sixth training ground.\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you!\u201dMartha kicked off from the ground while licking her lip. She surrounded herself with Titan\u2019s aura midair and struck down with her fist.Slam!As the fist falling like a shooting star crushed the ground, the sixth training ground trainees scattered.\u201cMartha Zieghart.\u201dThe trainee with a big build in the center lifted his sword and called Martha\u2019s name.\u201cAre you the vanguard?\u201dAfter spinning her wrist, Martha drew her sword from her waist.\u201cSince it\u2019s annoying, come at me at once.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Dunn Zieghart. I'm a collateral\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need the name of a guy that\u2019s about to be defeated!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe trainee that introduced himself as Dunn wasn\u2019t taunted. With a calm expression, he held his sword at mid height.\u201cYou don\u2019t look too bad!\u201dMartha snickered and pounced at Dunn, hacking at him.Slam!A thunderous noise resounded as the two swords clashed. Unlike Martha, who was standing her ground, Dunn was pushed back five steps away with a trembling hand.\u201cTsk.\u201dMartha clicked her tongue at seeing Dunn get pushed back.\u2018I wanted to finish him in a single strike.\u2019Despite her intention of finishing him in a single strike, Dunn had withstood her strike by being pushed back a few steps. He wasn\u2019t an opponent she could consider easy.\u2018But he\u2019s not a difficult opponent either.\u2019Martha strengthened her body using the Titan\u2019s aura. Her pressure soared rapidly.\u201cHmm!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dDunn and the sixth training ground trainees groaned, facing the energy wave.\u201cStop being annoying and just meet your end!\u201dWith her eyes gleaming like black pearls, she sliced up with her sword. The tremendous energy erupted like a volcano from her sword.\u201cThird formation!\u201dHolding his sword at mid height, Dunn gave out an unknown instruction. The four trainees that had been staying back stepped up next to him and gathered their swords.Slaam!Red flame burst out as Martha and the five people\u2019s swords clashed.\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cHold your ground!\u201dUnder the powerful pressure, the trainees grit their teeth and didn\u2019t withdraw.\u201cA group of weaklings are still weak!\u201dMartha snorted and struck with her sword. Her blade was covered in an energy even stronger than before.Slam!Along with a ground shattering noise, the trainees\u2019 bodies wavered.\u201cHaa.\u201d\u201cKugh.\u201dHowever, despite being pushed back, they didn\u2019t get knocked down. They kept holding out and groaning.\u201cFine, let\u2019s see who wins!\u201dMartha bit her lip and kept striking with her sword.\u201cSecond formation! Fifth formation!\u201dDunn kept defending against Martha\u2019s attacks by changing the defensive formation and the people.\u201cTsk. I\u2019ll deal with the other ones first!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already prepared for something like that!\u201dMartha tried to attack a short haired girl on the right side, avoiding Dunn, who standing in the center.However, Dunn and the trainees smoothly rotated like clock hands and blocked her sword.\u201d\u201cKu\u2026\u201dMartha bit her lip. It was just like he\u2019d said, they were prepared. As soon as she tried attacking another side, the trainees moved back and Dunn came forward. It was impossible to penetrate the formation.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Have they only been practicing blocking?\u2019Their defense was as solid as a rock, as if they\u2019d only been practicing defense. Halfhearted attacks were only going to end up exhausting her aura.\u201cHaa\u2026 It\u2019s so annoying.\u201dMartha walked back a step and brought up the full power of Titan\u2019s aura. The sword in her hand vibrated fiercely and shone with a light-yellow light.\u201cI admit that you\u2019re pretty decent. However, this is as far as you go.\u201d\u201cTenth formation!\u201dDunn didn\u2019t respond, shouting a number that he hadn\u2019t said yet. The eight trainees all stuck to his back.\u201cPointless!\u201dMartha dashed forward and poured out the Titan\u2019s aura filling her sword vertically.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cHold your ground!\u201dAt the same time that Dunn shouted, the trainees\u2019 bodies shone in the same color.Baam!A thunderous noise resounded throughout the mountain, and the earth and sand burst out from the ground like a fountain.\u201cHah!\u201dIn the midst of the raid of sand falling down, Martha\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cDid you withstand it?\u201dDunn and the trainees were breathing heavily and were pushed back significantly. However, they managed to take her full power without having a single drop person out.\u201cYou crazy bastards!\u201d\u201cHaaah!\u201dMartha kept striking with her sword, insanity gleaming in her eyes. Dunn and the trainees faltered, but never let go of their swords.\u201cYou bastards\u2026\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only protagonist of the world.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing our best, sweating our blood. Don\u2019t think you are going to win easily!\u201dMartha snapped.\u201cShut up!\u201dShe kept swinging her sword while screaming. Despite using all of her remaining energy, she couldn\u2019t break through Dunn\u2019s defense.Instead, it felt like his defense was getting more and more solid.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cWe kept practicing together in order to block your aura and swordsmanship. We are never going to lose as long as the sword formation remains.\u201d\u201cSword formation\u2026\u201dShe was obviously aware that they had a sword formation, and that was exactly what she\u2019d been trying to break through with power. But she didn\u2019t expect to be blocked to that extent.\u2018It\u2019s dangerous\u2026\u2019Martha furrowed her brows, withdrawing her sword to her side. Her aura was dwindling because she used too much energy earlier.However, since the nine of them were staying together, the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees were also recovering their aura faster.\u2018I need to buy some time.\u2019She didn\u2019t like that method, but she had no choice.\u201cShe is running out of strength. Spread out!\u201dAs she was trying to recover her aura by withdrawing a little, Dunn dashed forward, holding his sword. His eyes were too sharp.\u201cYou dare!\u201dSwinging the sword she was withdrawing, she hacked at Dunn\u2019s head.Slam!Dunn grit his teeth and withstood the shock. His hand was trembling, but he wasn\u2019t pushed back.\u201cDo it now!\u201dFollowing his instruction, the four trainees swung their swords from the top, bottom, left, and right.\u201cTsk!\u201dMartha twisted her blade to deflect their swords, but the attacks kept coming in waves.\u2018There\u2019s no opening.\u2019Dunn defended if she tried to attack them, and the rest started counterattacking afterward. The combination was unfolding like a cogwheel and was leaving her with no breathing room.\u2018Damn it! I can\u2019t lose here!\u2019She\u2019d underestimated them too much. She\u2019d thought they were just weaklings, and she didn\u2019t expect them to be prepared to this extent.Slam!Her sword, thrusting at their opening, was deflected by Dunn once again.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dMartha breathed heavily, dodging the blades raining down on her.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Was it because she was in a pinch? She remembered what Raon told her. That they could win regardless.\u2018That bastard. He probably knew about it already.\u2019He must\u2019ve been laughing at her, knowing that she was going to have so much difficulty.\u2018That\u2019s why I need to win this at all costs.\u2019Martha clenched her fist. She needed to put Raon in his place by breaking through somehow, but she couldn\u2019t find the way. Honestly, she felt like she was going to lose at the rate things were going.\u2018What shall I do?\u2019\u201cAre you thinking about something else during a battle?\u201dAs she was wondering about how she could win, Dunn\u2014who'd only been defending so far\u2014dashed at her like a bull.Wham!Martha was bounced back by a powerful body slam.\u201cDo it now!\u201dAt Dunn\u2019s instruction, the trainees thrust their swords at Martha, who couldn\u2019t regain her posture.\u201cFine! Even if I get defeated here, I\u2019ll beat you guys up!\u201dAs Martha held her sword upside down and was about to pounce at them like a beast, silver frost came up from the ground.\u201cTh-this is!\u201dRunaan came out from the bush with shining purple eyes.\u201cWh-why are you here\u2026?\u201d\u201cRaon is telling you to retreat.\u201dWhen Runaan swung her sword in a half circle, the frost on the ground shimmered up like a haze.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cOrder.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lose ye\u2026\u201d\u201cOrder.\u201d\u201cKugh, damn it!\u201dMartha lowered her hand, seeing Runaan\u2019s transparent eyes. She withdrew while biting her lip.After watching Dunn and the trainees she\u2019d separated using frost for a while, she followed Martha.\u201cThe\u00a0Martha ran away!\u201d\u201cW-we won! We really won!\u201d\u201cWaaaah!\u201dThe trainees cheered, screaming that it was worth completing Hell Week.The sixth training ground trainees\u2019 cheers didn\u2019t only happen at the center. It was also heard from the top, where Burren went to, and the bottom, where the collaterals were headed.Thud!As the trainees were cheering in victory, Kein Zieghart jumped down from the tree.\u201cSir Kein!\u201dDunn ran up to Kein, smiling brightly.\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cDid the others also win?\u201d\u201cYes. Just like we\u2019d expected, Raon and Runaan didn\u2019t move and we won in all three places.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cWe really won!\u201d\u201cAh, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe trainees hugged each other and smiled brightly.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to rejoice.\u201dKein raised his hand and the trainees stopped laughing.\u201cWe can\u2019t be careless until we take the enemy's flag.\u201dHis blue eyes shone like a starlight.\u201cProceed according to the plan until the very end.\u201d***Raon glanced at the fifth training ground trainees standing in front of him.They looked miserable, covered in soil mixed with their sweat. Their muscles were trembling and their eyes were filled with panic. They were the classic appearance of remnants that had lost their battle.Burren and the collaterals that arrived later were the same.Burren, who learned systematic swordsmanship, must have been stopped by the trainees that learned the \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019. He had been unable to do anything but get pushed back.\u201cHow was it? Was it as easy as you expected?\u201dNobody responded. Burren bit his lip and Martha glared at him with a murderous look.The other trainees also stared at the ground, unable to respond.\u201cShall I tell you what your mistake was?\u201dRaon\u2019s red eyes were distorted, like moonlight.\u201cYou believe that the world is stagnant, and that you are the only ones that are changing. \u2018Since we\u2019ve already won against them before, we should be able to win again. Since most of them dropped out of the exam, and they\u2019ve been looked down upon by the Owen Kingdom, we are going to win no matter what.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that what you were thinking?\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe trainees still couldn\u2019t respond, since it was just as he\u2019d said.\u201cThe world changes faster than you think. You might lose tomorrow to an opponent you won against today, and they might become a lot better than you the day after. However\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s voice went even lower. It was a frightening voice, as if it came up from deep underground.\u201cDid you say that you\u2019d win no matter what, without even knowing your own place? Despite not knowing the enemy's strategy, did you dare think that you could win? Can you make them all kneel on your own? Forget about winning, you wasted all your aura and stamina, showed them your techniques while you were lost in your arrogance. Really amazing.\u201dPast Burren and Martha, his gaze was directed at the trainees one by one. The trainees\u2019 bodies trembled.\u201cA lion does its best upon catching a rabbit. However, you aren\u2019t even lions. And they aren\u2019t rabbits. Those trainees are also swordsmen that have been training their swords every day in their life. You can\u2019t look down on them just because you are slightly ahead.\u201d\u201cKugh\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBurren and the trainees lowered their heads. Their faces were completely red in embarrassment. Martha couldn\u2019t say anything either, her face wrinkling.\u201cAre we going to lose, then?\u201dRunaan, who was standing back, stepped up next to him.\u201cWe might, but we might not.\u201dThe trainees raised their heads slowly at Raon\u2019s calm voice.\u201cW-we\u2019ve already used too much stamina and aura, just like you said.\u201d\u201cFour of us are already completely exhausted.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t a one-on-one spar, but a group battle. If you come to your senses even now, it\u2019s not too late to win.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do anything if I can smash that boulder guy.\u201dBurren and Martha clenched their fists so hard that they creaked. The trainees\u2019 eyes started to shine once again.\u201cYour eyes are still alive.\u201dRaon nodded, watching the heat shimmering in the trainees\u2019 eyes.\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you how you\u2019ll win.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Numbers? Decision making? None of those are the right answer. It\u2019s true that they have the numbers, but we are superior in terms of might and combat experience. Such a one-sided defeat wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, yet it did. Why do you think you lost?\u201d\u201c\u2026Because of the information?\u201dBurren slowly opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201dRaon nodded at Burren.\u201cThe sixth training ground fully understood the personalities and might of each of our members. They devised a strategy to counter each of us, using the Northern Grave Mountain\u2019s geography. However, we didn\u2019t prepare anything, thinking that we were obviously going to win.\u201d\u201cB-but the time\u2026\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much time, but the same goes for them. Honestly, one day is enough time to obtain the minimum information necessary for the fight. That\u2019s why Instructor Rimmer purposefully informed us one day before, so that we could get some practice.\u201dRaon snorted, glancing at the trainees.\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t give up on it because you were out of time, but because you were too careless, thinking you could easily win. Lack of time isn\u2019t an excuse.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe trainees couldn\u2019t refute that, so they just bit their lips.\u201cEven though the fifth training ground trainees are stronger than them individually, the difference isn\u2019t overwhelming. Losing to the sixth training ground, who was prepared, is a natural outcome.\u201d\u201cThen what shall we do? Isn\u2019t everything over\u2026?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019s over! Shut your mouth!\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dMartha frowned and Dorian, hands trembling, zipped his mouth.\u201cWell, there were casualties, and we\u2019ve lost a lot of stamina and aura. We are indeed at a disadvantage. However\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes glowed, looking at the location where the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees must be preparing for their attack.\u201cThey aren\u2019t the only ones that have information.\u201d\u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201d\u201cThe top trainee of the sixth training ground, Kein Zieghart, is the one who has been giving the instructions. He was the one who sent people in that can counter you guys.\u201d\u201cKein Zieghart? How did he do that?\u201dMartha ground her teeth.\u201cKein Zieghart has an excellent sight and perception. He perceived the direction of your movement from afar and sent trainees that you\u2019d have difficulties dealing with.\u201d\u201cKuh! Kein Zieghart.\u201dBurren groaned at his pride being trampled.\u201cHe sent swordsmen that were proficient in defense to Martha, who is straightforward with an excellent strength and endurance, in order to exhaust your aura. He sent swordsmen that have learned the \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019 to Burren, who uses honest and systematic swordsmanship, so that you couldn\u2019t do much against them.\u201dRaon told them precisely why the fifth training ground had lost.\u201cThen, how can we win? It\u2019s simple. We have to change our opponents. We would win without much difficulty if Burren and Martha swapped their opponents.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do! I can\u2019t hold back my anger if we end up winning like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, but the same goes for me. Winning by running away is meaningless for me.\u201dMartha, Burren, and the collaterals all shut their mouths tightly.\u201cAlright. Then here\u2019s the second solution.\u201dRaon nodded, as if he was expecting their reaction.\u201cWe are going to attack differently.\u201d\u201cAttack differently?\u201d\u201cThe sword formation that Martha faced was certainly solid, but the movement of their aura was sloppy. If you use your senses to strike where they couldn\u2019t move their aura in time, you can easily break through it.\u201dHe faced away from Martha and looked at Burren.\u201cYour systematic sword, which pursues perfection, is mere prey to the \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019. It is about swinging your sword without thinking, relying on your instincts.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren frowned and nodded his head.\u201cThe \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019 is a technique that relies on instincts, so they are easily tricked by fake movements. Use a feint and aim for the moment they take the bait. You should be able to do it.\u201dThe trainees\u2019 eyes were so wide, they looked like they would pop out.\u201cH-how?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been here all along.\u201d\u201cHow did you know all that?\u201d\u201cHow on earth\u2026\u201dThe way he\u2019d grasped the situation was more astonishing than their defeat against the sixth training ground.\u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of perception\u2026?\u201dMartha and Burren\u2019s jaws also dropped in surprise.\u201cBut what shall we do if they change their plans?\u201dDorian raised his hand and asked his question. Since he was a coward, it seemed he also had lots of worries.\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable question, but their plans aren't going to change.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause they\u2019ve achieved victory once. The sweet taste of victory will make them repeat the same strategy to achieve an even more perfect victory.\u201dThe hair on the back of the trainees\u2019 necks stood on its ends, facing Raon\u2019s confident gaze.\u201cBut you said Kein\u2019s perception is excellent. What if he reacts quickly and comes to the center or the top as reinforcement?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. My perception is better than Kein\u2019s.\u201dFeeling Kein\u2019s presence at the center, Raon smiled.\u201cAnd he is going to come over here.\u201d***Metun frowned, upon arriving at the fifth training ground\u2019s foothold after checking the sixth training ground\u2019s trainees.\u201cHe is an arrogant child.\u201dHe was worried, because he\u2019d heard how calm and composed Raon Zieghart was, but it seemed like he didn\u2019t need to worry.\u2018Saying that his perception is better than Kein\u2019s, that\u2019s just ridiculous.\u2019Kein Zieghart\u2019s strongest point wasn\u2019t his excellent swordsmanship nor his outstanding amount of aura.Perception.He had an excellent perception and sight that could read the opponent\u2019s presence and condition.He was even able to find the hiding instructors\u2019 locations, so it wasn\u2019t excessive to say that his perception wasn\u2019t at a trainee\u2019s level anymore.Yet Raon said his perception was better than Kein\u2019s. Honestly, he couldn\u2019t help snorting at him.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be over soon.\u201dConsidering Raon and the fifth training ground\u2019s attitude, it looked like they could achieve victory a lot easier than he\u2019d expected.\u2018I should prepare a feast for the children.\u2019The winners should be rewarded. Metun was about to head back, thinking about the feast the sixth training ground was going to have to celebrate their victory.\u201cAren\u2019t you the arrogant one?\u201dA cheerful voice, carried by the wind, came from behind him.Metun calmly turned around. A red-haired elf was giving off a sly smile.\u201cDid you just arrive?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been spectating for a while now.\u201d\u201cYou always give excuses after being late.\u201d\u201cI told you that\u2019s not true.\u201dMetun frowned, hearing Rimmer\u2019s light voice.\u201cBut what did you mean by that just now?\u201d\u201cJust now?\u201d\u201cYou told me I was arrogant.\u201d\u201cAh, about that.\u201dRimmer scratched his neck and snickered.\u201cOur side didn\u2019t even draw our sword yet, and you\u2019re considering the fight over, so arrogant is the best way to describe you.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t even drawn your sword, huh? You fought us head on and were already defeated. You are way more exhausted than us, in stamina and aura alike. It\u2019s just hopeless.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d\u201cYou are just like that child. You guys are just bluffing.\u201dMetun shook his head, looking back and forth between Rimmer and Raon, who was giving instructions to the trainees.\u201cKein\u2019s perception is good enough to find the instructors\u2019 presence. There\u2019s no trainee in this small battlefield that can strategize better than him. He won\u2019t be able to locate anyone\u2014he\u2019ll just end up losing like this.\u201d\u201cFinding the instructors\u2019 presence, huh\u2026?\u201dRimmer grinned and didn\u2019t finish his sentence.\u201cRaon has already located my presence before, not just the other instructors.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe Raon Zieghart you underestimated because you considered him arrogant has found where I was hiding before.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s a lie!\u201dMetun\u2019s eyes wavered for the first time.\u2018That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019Rimmer was an elf, despite injuring his energy center. It was difficult even for Metun himself to find him if he hid his presence, so he couldn\u2019t believe that such a young trainee could sense him.\u201cI don\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201cBullshit. I\u2019m pretty sure you lie more than fifty percent of the time.\u201d\u201cAh, let me correct myself. I don\u2019t lie about those children.\u201dRimmer nodded and grinned.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dMetun gulped and watched underneath.\u201cEven if Raon Zieghart has a better perception than Kein just like you said, it\u2019s already too late. The victory is already decided.\u201d\u201cWell, it does certainly look difficult, since four people have been eliminated and they are mostly out of strength. However, Raon has never disappointed me, not once.\u201dRimmer grinned, watching Raon giving out instructions to the trainees.\u201cIf your students are as careless as you right now, they will get wiped out in a blink of an eye.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The sixth training ground trainees that had tasted victory were gathered in a circle just like in the morning, and Kein was at the center with the map of the Northern Grave Mountain.\u201cThe fifth training ground\u2019s flag is located here.\u201dKein pointed to the western end with his finger.\u201cIt will be over once we attack there.\u201d\u201cIt was worth all the effort, since we are actually about to win against the fifth training ground.\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to look at us differently after this.\u201dThe trainees smiled as if the battle was already over.\u201cI told you it\u2019s too early to rejoice.\u201dKein stomped the ground to gather the trainees\u2019 attention.\u201cRaon Zieghart and Runaan Sullion are at full strength. Raon is particularly problematic since he is the strongest guy in the fifth training ground. We will lose if we are careless.\u201d\u201cBut Burren and Martha have already exhausted most of their strength, and four of their trainees have been eliminated.\u201d\u201cWe are at an advantage, indeed. But I\u2019m telling you to stop being careless.\u201d\u201cWe will easily win if Sir Kein grasps their situation and instructs us just like before.\u201d\u201cYes, we are counting on you!\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dKein nodded slightly. He was pretending to be composed, but his immaturity was showing.\u201cAnyway, you can\u2019t be careless. Do your best until the end.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe trainees responded loud and clear, then stood up.\u201cThere are two potential ways they are going to move from here on\u2026 Hmm?\u201dKein, who was pointing his finger at the map, started glaring to the west.\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThe fifth training ground trainees have started moving once again.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dKein closed his eyes without responding. Feeling the approaching trainees\u2019 presence by opening his perception, he smiled lightly.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as before. Martha at the center, Burren at the top and the rest are at the bottom.\u201d\u201cThey still haven\u2019t learned.\u201d\u201cIf they want to lose, then we are going to make them lose.\u201d\u201cI guess even Raon can\u2019t control Burren and Martha.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already over.\u201dThe trainees laughed at the fifth training ground\u2019s trainees, who were running at them like fireflies.\u201cWe are going to use the same strategy. Decal will face Burren Zieghart alongside the second and third groups, Dunn will face Martha with the first group, and Puyon will head to the bottom. Karin and I will stand by in preparation for Raon and Runaan.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe sixth training ground trainees answered loudly, then ran off to defeat their assigned opponents.\u201cLet\u2019s prepare to finish this.\u201dKein glanced back as he stood up. Karin drew her sword, nodding at him.\u201cThen which side is the first\u2026 hmm?\u201dHe frowned, looking towards the bottom.\u2018Runaan also moved this time.\u2019He could feel the presence of frost from the bottom. Runaan Sullion was there.\u201cKarin.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dKarin nodded and ran towards the location Runaan was headed.\u2018Karin should be able to stop her.\u2019Karin was a successor of a high rank vassal family just like Runaan.\u00a0 Since she knew Runaan better than anyone, she wouldn\u2019t be easily defeated.Wham! Whack!The crashing sound of boulders could be heard from the center. It was the sound of Martha clashing against Dunn once again.Bang!Shortly after that, the sound of Burren clashing with Decal could also be heard.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dWith two people standing guard, Kein closed his eyes and widened his perception.Since he needed to send reinforcement if any side was getting pushed back, he scattered his aura at the top center and bottom to grasp the situation.Huh?After checking all three sides, Kein\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cH-how! Why are they all losing?\u201dTop, center, and bottom were all being pushed back by the fifth training ground.\u201cHow is this happening?\u201dEven though they were facing the same opponent as in the morning, they were now losing one-sidedly. It was unbelievable.\u2018Raon Zieghart. What have you done?!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s best to change your opponent.\u201d\u2018I\u2019ll never do that!\u2019She swore immediately as he told her to run away from her opponents. Raon wasn\u2019t surprised, nodding as if he knew she would say that.\u201cThen I\u2019ll give you different instructions. Break the sword formation.\u201d\u201cThe sword formation?\u201d\u201cThe opponent\u2019s sword formation isn\u2019t perfect. No, it can\u2019t be perfect since they are just trainees.\u201d\u201cIn what way are they not perfect?\u201d\u201cThey stopped you by gathering nine people\u2019s auras together. Which means that the aura has moved within the sword formation.\u201d\u201cWhich means\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you aim for that moment, you can break the sword formation in your current state, even when you\u2019ve already spent a lot of your aura.\u201dChills ran down her spine upon hearing that.\u2018What is that guy?\u2019Despite having just been sitting there, he noticed the enemy\u2019s weaknesses and told her how to defeat them. He really looked like a monster.\u201cRather than weakness, I want to win against them head on.\u201dSince she didn\u2019t want to get overwhelmed by Raon\u2019s words, she spoke without thinking.\u201cYes. You can win against them after recovering your strength and aura, since you are outstanding. However, do you think you can do it right now?\u201dShe obviously wasn\u2019t able to respond. She couldn\u2019t imagine herself winning against those high-stamina monsters in her current exhausted state.\u201cLike I said, this isn\u2019t a one-on-one spar, but a team competition. Make your choice right now. Are you to choose your pride, resulting in an uncertain victory, or are you going to choose the team\u2019s victory?\u201dMartha stood up in silence upon hearing that.\u2018I would\u2019ve ignored something like that before.\u2019Her arrogant self from before she lost to Raon would\u2019ve kept fighting no matter what he told her.However, she\u2019d already experienced defeat once, and she could experience it a second time now. It was better to win no matter what, rather than losing.\u2018His name was Dunn.\u2019She could see that Dunn guy that she\u2019d fought before from afar. His rock-solid pressure was the same as before. She wanted to break through it with her fist, but she held herself back by gritting her teeth.\u201cDid you come back despite knowing that you can\u2019t win against us? How stupid.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get hurt if you just say whatever you want.\u201d\u2018Just like me, before.\u2019Martha kicked off from the ground and dashed towards Dunn.\u201cFourth formation!\u201dThe trainees from behind came up next to him and gathered their aura.\u201cHmph!\u201dInstead of striking the sword that she raised upwards, she spread her perception.She could feel the sixth training ground trainees\u2019 aura gathering around Dunn.\u2018It\u2019s really slow.\u2019It was just like Raon had said. Since they were dealing with a large amount of aura, the movement was as slow as a snail.\u201cHmph!\u201dMartha inhaled heavily and turned to the right.\u201cPointless!\u201dDunn turned around and stood in front of her. It was the same development as before, but there was a difference.Martha, who used to brainlessly swing her sword, pummeled her sword down at Dunn\u2019s right flank, where the aura wasn\u2019t gathered yet.Wham!The two swords clashed, creating a powerful wave.Martha was pushed back by the impact, but Dunn and the trainees\u2019 sword formation that used to be as solid as a deep-rooted tree also wavered significantly.\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cKuu\u2026\u201dDunn and the trainees groaned, then fixed the wavering sword formation.Martha\u2019s eyes shone like black pearls.\u2018He was right!\u2019It was just like Raon had said. The place that the aura hadn\u2019t gathered yet had a significantly weaker defense than the other places.\u201cThis really was a breakthrough.\u201dMartha smirked.Was it because the breakthrough was too easy?It wasn\u2019t. Raon Zieghart had noticed the sword formation\u2019s weakness, sitting at the foothold with the flag. It was because she was frightened by his monstrosity.\u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant just because you\u2019ve come out ahead once!\u201d\u201cOnce? Stop making me laugh! It\u2019s every time from now on!\u201dMartha pounced with a battle cry.She moved to the left while pretending to attack, then she swung her sword towards Dunn\u2019s lower body, where the aura didn\u2019t move in time.Wham!Dunn quickly swung his sword in response, but his upper body wavered significantly and the trainees in the sword formation bounced out of formation.\u201cIt\u2019s over now!\u201dEmanating a beast-like pressure, Martha pounced at Dunn.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Burren spun the wrist holding his sword and raised his head.Decal, who was one of the best collateral trainees, was glaring fiercely at him.\u2018I lost against him before.\u2019Decal and the seven trainees attacked him at once, and since they\u2019d used the \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019 that countered his swordsmanship, he couldn\u2019t find any way of winning.The other guys couldn\u2019t help him either because of the difference in numbers, so he kept getting pushed back.They weren\u2019t lying when they said they had thoroughly planned in preparation to defeat the fifth training ground.\u2018I\u2019m not going to lose like before.\u2019Retreating once was enough.

Moving to the side like flowing water, he used the \u2018Phenomenal Sword\u2019.His sword was bent towards Decal on his right side.\u201cDo it now!\u201d\u201cAttack him at once!\u201dThe moment Burren started his attack, the trainees that learned the \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019 rushed at him.However, that was a trap laid down by Burren.Wham!The training sword that was aimed at Decal curved like a crescent moon and hit the wrists and chests of the trainees that were coming at him.\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dIn the blink of an eye, two trainees were rolling on the ground, grabbing their wrists and chests. Their conditions were so bad, it was safe to consider them eliminated.\u201cHmph!\u201dBurren didn\u2019t stop swinging his sword. Using the River Footwork, he kept moving and swung the \u2018Phenomenal Sword\u2019.Because his large motion used his entire shoulder, the three trainees instinctively counterattacked, aiming for that opening.\u2018Get baited.\u2019Burren\u2019s blue eyes sparkled. Bending his elbow naturally, he stuck the incoming trainees\u2019 chest without reservation.Whack!Three trainees were sent away flying in a single strike.\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe one that was hit at the end managed to stand back up, but the other two had already fainted.\u201cD-damn it!\u201dDecal chased him, but it was too late since Burren had already stepped aside.\u201cWh-what happened?! Why are you suddenly mixing in feints?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201dBurren frowned.\u2018How can it change this much from just mixing in feints?\u2019\u2018Intuition Sword\u2019 was a swordsmanship that relied on instinct instead of being systematic. The trainees that were still immature had no choice but to splash around, baited by the feints.\u2018But how did he even realize that?\u2019He was certain Raon didn\u2019t move from that place. The perception and knowledge of the guy that observed the entire situation from his seat gave him goosebumps.\u2018Martha must be feeling the same way right now.\u2019He was sure that Martha, who was fighting further down, must\u2019ve been thinking the same thing.\u2018He\u2019s like an onion.\u2019Raon showed him another side of himself just when he thought he finally understood him. Just like an onion, new layers kept coming out upon peeling him open.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet!\u201d\u201cHaaa!\u201dDecan dashed at him, gritting his teeth. The three other trainees did the same.Whoosh!Burren thrust his sword forward. It was a powerful strike, multiple openings could be seen in his big motion.\u201cIt\u2019s a feint. Don\u2019t pay attention to it! Huh?\u201dDecal\u2019s eyes were wide. He was planning to ignore it, but the trajectory of Burren\u2019s sword didn\u2019t change.\u201cIt\u2019s a real one this time!\u201d\u201cN-no way!\u201dHe tried to defend against it, but it was already too late.Wham!Taking the powerful strike, Decal\u2019s training sword broke and his body was sent back flying.\u201cThe fight is already over.\u201dLooking at the remaining trainees, Burren\u2019s eyes glowed.\u201cIt\u2019s our victory.\u201dAs long as that monster existed, there was no way the fifth training ground could lose.***\u201cWh-what is this?!\u201dMetun\u2019s eyes were about to pop out of his head as he watched the sixth training ground trainees lose at the same time.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201dHe could understand one side starting to lose. However, top, center, and bottom were all being pushed back at the same time against the opponents they\u2019d won against.\u201cI told you already, the battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201dRimmer, who was lying down next to him, murmured provokingly while yawning\u201cYou must\u2019ve done something!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, but Raon did.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBefore you came to watch, Raon gave them advice. And that worked.\u201d\u201cAre you saying a mere trainee\u2019s advice changed the situation this much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s not a mere trainee. He\u2019s Raon.\u201dRimmer smirked and pointed at Raon, who was protecting the flag on his own.\u201cSome trainees don\u2019t follow him, and some dislike him. However, they all trust his power and decision making. I think they\u2019ll start following his words like a god\u2019s voice.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dMetun groaned. That meant he was trusted by the others.However, rather than the fact that he was trusted, the way his advice significantly changed the tide of the battle was more surprising.\u201cWhat was the advice?\u201d\u201cAre you curious? If you are, then give me the gold\u2026 Ah, alright.\u201dRimmer waved his hand, noticing Metun\u2019s stiffened expression.\u201cFirstly, about the top\u2026\u201dHe told Metun about the advice Raon gave the trainees.\u201cThat\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201dMetun\u2019s fingers trembled.\u2018How can a trainee give such advice?\u2019It was a perfect walkthrough, without a single flaw.However, what was more surprising was the fact that he\u2019d noticed all those weaknesses by only using his perception.Rimmer was correct. The arrogant one wasn\u2019t Raon, but himself.He deserved the praise of having a better perception than Kein.\u2018However.\u2019Watching Kein, who had started his move, Metun smiled confidently.\u2018The match isn\u2019t over yet.\u2019***Raon, who was sitting under the flag, opened his eyes.\u2018They are all doing pretty well.\u2019While hiding his presence, he released his fully opened perception in order to observe the status of the battle. He smiled.Burren, who managed to defeat Decal, stormed through the trainees that had learned the \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019, and Martha was beating up the remaining trainees after breaking through the sword formation.And Runaan\u2026She was having an icy competition against the sixth training ground\u2019s better trainee, who came out to be her opponent.\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019Since it looked like she wasn\u2019t going to lose, it was going to be fine.\u2018Well, then\u2026\u2019Raon stood up. As he warmed himself up, the bushes swayed and a blond, blue-eyed swordsman appeared.\u2018Kein Zieghart.\u2019The sixth training ground\u2019s top trainee, and the member of the direct line that was two years older than him, had appeared.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Since they were losing in every direction, and Raon himself was hiding his presence, there was only one thing he could do.Seize the opponent\u2019s flag.\u201cSo you were here, Raon Zieghart.\u201dKein bit his lip. He didn\u2019t look surprised, as he must\u2019ve been expecting it.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to cast magic on the trainees. I heard you weren\u2019t acknowledged by them, but it must\u2019ve been a false rumor.\u201dHe slowly drew his sword from around his waist.\u201cHowever, this is the end.\u201d\u201cThe end?\u201d\u201cI heard your aura has a fire attribute.\u201dAs he said that, a crimson flame flared up on his blade.\u201cUnfortunately, my aura is the highest tier fire attribute aura, and I have more aura than a regular swordsman. In this match up, you can\u2019t win against me.\u201d\u201cMatch up, huh?\u201dRaon smirked and unsheathed his sword. The energy from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 created a red flower as it heated up the blade.Whir!It was a lot smaller than the fire on Kein\u2019s sword, but the color was incomparably denser.\u201cPeople from this house really talk a lot before fighting.\u201dRaon declared, eyes the same color as the flame.\u201cCome at me. I\u2019ll show you how a single flower of flame can engulf your fire.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They arrogantly believe that they are always ahead of the others, without realizing that there are plenty of people as strong as them.\u201dHe smirked and pointed at Raon.\u201cThe only person who judges his own abilities objectively in the fifth training ground is Raon. That\u2019s why I wanted to teach them a lesson.\u201d\u201cWait! No way, were you actually in that pub because\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I went to the pub you frequent on purpose. I wanted to make the fifth and sixth training ground fight each other by taunting you.\u201d\u201cRimmer\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. You were aiming for us as well.\u201dRimmer turned around to look at Metun, smiling softly.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the way you\u2019ve been teaching them well, and the children\u2019s wholehearted efforts. No one is going to look down on you in the future.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dMetun frowned and turned his head. It seemed he liked the compliment since his cheeks had become slightly red.\u201cBut Rimmer, you are also mistaken about one thing.\u201dHe turned his face back, with vivid eyes.\u201cMistaken? What kind of mistake?\u201d\u201cThe battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201dMetun raised his hand and pointed at Raon, who was standing in front of Kein.\u201cThe Raon\u2019s aura is a mid-high level fire attribute cultivation technique, which isn\u2019t anything special. However, Kein is born with the fire attribute\u2019s disposition, and has acquired a highest tier cultivation technique. Raon is unable to win against Kein in this matchup.\u201dAs Metun finished speaking, a crimson flame flared up on Kein\u2019s blade.\u201cAh, this is another mistake.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you realize. The result\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t about me, but you.\u201dRimmer giggled. He turned his head and pointed at Raon, who was drawing his sword.Whap!A very small flame ignited on Raon\u2019s blade.\u201cOpen your eyes and watch.\u201dRimmer\u2019s eyes were burning red, much like the flame ignited on Raon\u2019s blade.\u201cHow the small flame will engulf the bigger flame.\u201d***Kein Zieghart furrowed his brow, watching the small flame ignited on Raon\u2019s blade. It was as beautiful as a flower, but it was too small.\u2018It\u2019s small.\u2019The small flame could barely cover the end of the blade. It was too thin to cut through anyone.\u2018But there must be something about him.\u2019He couldn\u2019t have become the top trainee by playing hopscotch.Considering which opponents Raon had faced and won against so far, that energy must\u2019ve been extraordinary.\u2018But I\u2019m stronger.\u2019He kept cultivating his aura non-stop for two years after getting injured. Swordsmanship would\u2019ve been a different story, but he didn\u2019t lose to the regular swordsmen in terms of the aura\u2019s quantity.Moreover, since he\u2019d acquired the highest tier fire attribute aura and could use it to engulf Raon\u2019s flame, the match was already decided.Unless he was taken off guard, he could obtain victory, reversing the unfavorable situation.\u201cHere I go!\u201dKein brandished his sword and kicked off from the ground.\u2018I need to break through it with power.\u2019Raon was famous for his talent in swordsmanship. In order to avoid getting dragged around by his techniques, he needed to finish the fight in one fell swoop using speed and power.\u201cHaa!\u201dRight before he pummeled Raon\u2019s shoulder with his flame sword, he raised his head.Huh?Serene eyes.He got goosebumps as he looked at eyes that didn\u2019t match the situation at all. He brandished the sword containing that small flame.\u2018It\u2019s too late.\u2019Putting strength into his waist and thigh, he completed his attack.Clang!The moment the two swords clashed, he fueled up his aura to full power.Wham!The flame rising from the blade was burning fiercely, as if it was going to engulf Raon as a whole.However, something unexpected happened.Tsssk!The small flame at the end of Raon\u2019s sword started engulfing the huge flame covering Kein\u2019s blade.\u201cWh-what is happening?!\u201dKein\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018How does this make any sense?\u2019Such a small flame was engulfing his flame, when it should\u2019ve been the other way around. It was unbelievable.He met Raon\u2019s eyes over the sword. His eyes were even calmer than before. He still had a lot of room to spare.\u201cArrrgh!\u201dKein grit his teeth. Using all his energy from his energy center, he sliced with his sword.The aura exploded fiercely, to a point where a red line was drawn in the air, but Raon stepped up instead.Whir!His sword was changing from a heavy boulder to a sharp wind.The silver blade was penetrating him like a beast\u2019s fang.\u201cHuff!\u201dKein hurriedly used his aura to slash his sword.Clank!\u2018I blocked it.\u2019\u2018I certainly blocked it, yet what is my sword\u2026\u2019It was a single strike. In a single strike, the training sword shattered. He couldn\u2019t believe such a small flame contained such a tremendous amount of power.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201dThe sound of wind could be heard once again, and his back was hurting as if it was being crushed.\u201cKugh!\u201dUnable to withstand Raon\u2019s punch, Kein was struck to the ground while screaming.\u201cKuuu!\u201dAs he was standing back up and enduring the pain of his ribs being crushed, he heard Raon\u2019s voice from above him.\u201cMatchup?\u201dRaon tilted his head with an innocent expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s a matchup?\u201d***After beating down Kein, Raon sat on the tree trunk once again. After waiting a while, the fifth training ground trainees showed up through the bushes.Some of them had fallen, but most of them had returned nice and healthy. Martha was holding the enemy\u2019s flag.\u201cTh-that thing, I mean, isn\u2019t that person Kein Zieghart?\u201dDorian was looking at Kein, whose hands were tied up, with soulless eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s right. When the battle started going badly, he came here immediately.\u201d\u201cWow, the young master really never loses.\u201dA few trainees, including Dorian, smirked. They were saying that he was amazing.\u201cIt was just like you said.\u201dBurren approached him with an awkward expression.\u201cThe incomplete \u2018Intuition Sword\u2019 was easily tricked by the feints, so much that it was ridiculous.\u201dHe scratched his head, then breathed out slowly and started talking again.\u201cI believed I could do better than you as a commander at least, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. If you weren\u2019t here today, we would\u2019ve lost to the sixth training ground.\u201dThe trainees behind Burren nodded in agreement.\u201cI acknowledge you as the top trainee once again. I\u2019ll follow your orders from now on without any complaint.\u201dHe thumped his chest and turned around. His ears turned completely red, showing that he was embarrassed once again.Stab!Martha stuck the sixth training ground\u2019s flag into the ground.\u201cI don\u2019t really like it, but he\u2019s right. I hate to say it, but the best contributor in today\u2019s victory is you.\u201dShe said that if his instruction ended up being weird, then she was going to give up on that promise.\u201cRaon.\u201dRunaan, who came back in a better shape than anyone, nodding strongly\u2014as if she was telling him good job. It was her way of complimenting him.Looking at those three people, one after another, Raon smiled lightly.\u2018This is how the fifth training ground should be.\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHa\u2026\u201dMetun smiled bitterly. His gaze was fixated on Raon, who made Kein kneel after beating him up.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect that small flame to be that strong.\u2019Raon\u2019s small flame didn\u2019t lose to Kein\u2019s large flame. Instead, it was overwhelming in terms of ferocity.Rimmer wasn\u2019t talking nonsense when he said it was going to engulf the other.\u2018It\u2019s not just the power, he was also watching his opponent properly.\u2019Kein\u2019s flame was certainly strong, but there was a gap at the bottom of the blade where he couldn\u2019t cover it with aura.It was a small gap that was difficult to notice for a trainee.\u2018However\u2026\u2019He\u2019d noticed it.Raon Zieghart had noticed Kein\u2019s mistake and swung his sword at that weakness to grasp his victory.\u2018Amazing.\u2019He thought Kein\u2019s perception was amazing, but Raon\u2019s was even better. His perception was so sensitive and polished, to the point that it was still difficult to believe despite having witnessed it.\u2018He\u2019s insanely gusty, too.\u2019Analyzing the enemy\u2019s weakness and swinging his sword in a spur of the moment wasn\u2019t something just anyone could do. His mind was already on par with qualified swordsmen.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dMetun sighed and stood up. He turned around and nodded.\u201cI have no choice but to acknowledge him.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dRimmer, who was half lying down, nodded in satisfaction.\u201cI complimented that boy, but why do you look so satisfied?\u201d\u201cBecause he\u2019s my student.\u201d\u201cWhat about it? He must\u2019ve been training on his own while you were playing around.\u201d\u201cWell, something like that did happen before.\u201dRimmer snickered and got up.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cThey think of each other as rivals, but they don\u2019t antagonize or hate each other. Since they are all under Zieghart\u2019s name, this is a good opportunity to get acquainted to each other. Let\u2019s give them a feast.\u201d\u201cHmm, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201cYou are paying for it, right?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dMetun nodded. Since he made a bet with Rimmer, paying for the children\u2019s food wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201cI knew you were a generous guy!\u201dRimmer smiled and ran towards the trainees gathering around Raon.\u201cWe are going to feast with someone else\u2019s money!\u201d***Raon took his fork and knife, watching the food piling up on the long rectangular table.He cut the grilled pork in front of him into a small slice and put it in his mouth. The skin was crispy, the meat was moist, and it melted in his mouth. The taste was strong, but extremely delicious.Wow! This is so good. I love it. It\u2019s a condensed flavor that captures the King of Essence\u2019s picky taste.\u2018I agree, it\u2019s pretty good.\u2019Try eating the pie over there next. Ever since Devildom, the King of Essence has loved pies. Every morning and evening\u2026Raon ignored him and ate the stew on his right side. It was soft and tasty.Th-this isn\u2019t bad either but listen to the King of Essence. Pie! It\u2019s a pie!\u2018Such a place existed around here.\u2019As soon as the battle ended, Rimmer had brought the trainees from the fifth and sixth training grounds to a restaurant inside the domain.He was worried because the restaurant\u2019s exterior looked old, but the dishes were varied, and the taste was great. It seemed an excellent chef had cooked using quality ingredients.\u2018And yet\u2026\u2019He looked around while eating another slice of pork. The atmosphere was as lethargic as an old piano wire. The fifth training ground, who came out victorious, and the sixth training ground, who had lost, were both depressed.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019The fifth training ground almost lost to the sixth training ground that they believed they could easily win against, and the sixth training ground had lost despite having prepared thoroughly. Both parties being depressed wasn\u2019t anything strange.Of course, that wasn\u2019t the case for everyone.\u201cI\u2019m realizing once again that I really taught them very well.\u201dRimmer giggled while drinking the most expensive black beer.\u201cGiving out that advice was great, but did you see how they followed that advice? My students are really amazing.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything today.\u201d\u201cWho do you think taught Raon? It was me! Therefore, his achievements are also mine.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe two of them were having a reflection meeting on the battle. Although, it didn\u2019t sound like a reflection meeting. Rimmer was just boasting, instead.On the other hand, the sound of eating was the only thing that could be heard from the trainees\u2019 table, just like a lunch after training. Thinking that it couldn\u2019t be helped, he was about to eat his fried chicken.\u2018Was his name Dunn?\u2019The big guy that fought against Martha at the center came up to her.\u201cYou were stronger than I heard. Your attack and defense were both great. You were amazing at the first encounter, but I was really freaked out when you started aiming for the sword formation\u2019s gap on the second encounter.\u201dJust like his honest appearance, Dunn told her how he felt. Martha seemed flustered, as she dropped the broccoli from her fork.\u201cWon\u2019t you train with me one day? I\u2019m sure it will be helpful for both of u\u2026\u201d\u201cScram.\u201dOf course, Martha shook her hand without even looking at him.\u2018I guess she isn\u2019t going to start rampaging at this rate.\u2019Raon secretly nodded. Martha would\u2019ve normally started punching him already, but the way she answered signified that she took a liking to him.\u201cSir Burren.\u201dDecal also moved next to Burren, seizing the opportunity.\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201dBurren frowned and raised his head.\u201cDo you usually practice feints?\u201d\u201cNot that much.\u201d\u201cThey looked like very polished feints to me. They looked so real that I couldn\u2019t give up on the opportunity. I ended up going for it like a dog on a bone.\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201dBurren\u2019s face went slightly red. It seemed that he liked the compliment.\u201cWell, your \u2018Intuition Sword' was also pretty sharp. I couldn\u2019t find any way to break through it until I started using the feints. It was the first time my swordsmanship was countered so hard\u2026.\u201dBurren complimented Decan in return.\u201cBut we still lost to Sir Burren in the end. We really couldn\u2019t do anything once you started using the feints at the end.\u201d\u201cWell, the swordsmanship is one thing, but my aura is better than yours, so\u2026\u201dIt seemed Burren took a liking to Decal\u2019s honesty. He was even turned around, talking about swordsmanship and aura.With that as the trigger, the trainees that had been reading the atmosphere started to talk about the battle, visiting the ones they\u2019d faced.They discussed which parts were amazing, and which parts were troublesome, as if they were having a debate.\u201cI heard you like ice cream.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cWhich ice cream?\u201d\u201cBead.\u201dRunaan was also sitting in front of a cute-looking girl. Whether they were having a proper conversation was questionable.\u201cHeave ho.\u201dHe could hear somebody sitting next to him. When he looked next to him, it was the sixth training ground\u2019s top trainee, Kein Zieghart, that he fought against at the end.\u201cIt was my complete defeat. I didn\u2019t expect you to break my sword by attacking the spot where my aura was weak.\u201dHe nodded his head, face full of admiration.\u201cI\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t a coincidence, right?\u201d\u201cThat is correct, sir.\u201dRaon nodded honestly.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to talk so formally. We are both trainees, after all.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to refuse if he wanted him to talk casually, so he nodded.\u201cI believed I was the best at my age in terms of perception, but apparently that was my arrogance.\u201dKein smiled, with the expression of having accepted everything. It was different than before. Meeting a member of the direct line with such a personality was rather refreshing.\u201cThat was a great lesson for me, both tactically and mentally. Thank you.\u201d\u201cA lesson?\u201d\u201cThanks to you, I learned that I shouldn\u2019t be careless until the very end, and that I need to prepare for the plan\u2019s failure. You probably told me all that in order to teach me a lesson.\u201dKein stood up and slowly lowered his head.\u201cYou are my benefactor. Thank you.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dRaon tilted his head.What is he even saying?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRaon furrowed his brows.\u2018Is he thanking me?\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand it.He had shattered the strategy Kein did his best to devise, he had won against him in the duel, and he had also hit his chest in the end, so he couldn\u2019t understand why he was lowering his head to thank him.\u201cYou look like you don\u2019t understand.\u201dKein smirked, like he expected that to happen.\u201cI believed that we could defeat you guys no matter what in this all-out battle. I had identified your personalities and might before the battle was even decided so that we could win against you whenever it happened.\u201d\u201cThat was indeed rather dangerous.\u201dUnderstanding Martha and Burren\u2019s personalities and swordsmanship to devise a strategy against them had worked. If he hadn\u2019t sent Runaan to call them back, they would\u2019ve been eliminated right there.\u201cYes. However, it was dangerous, and we didn\u2019t manage to win. I believed everything was over after a small victory. I never expected you to have a better perception than me, for you to be skilled at hiding your presence, and I didn\u2019t think Martha and Burren would change that much.\u201dKein sighed heavily.\u201cLastly, I never imagined losing in a one-on-one fight against you. Aura was the one thing I was confident about since cultivating was all I did while recovering, yet I still can\u2019t believe I lost to such a small flame.\u201dHe was still thinking that the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 was weak. It was a mistake, but since he didn\u2019t really need to correct him, he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cI really learned a lot during this battle. I have to always keep in mind that there might be someone better than me in the enemy camp, despite them being younger, and never let my guards down.\u201dHe saw Kein\u2019s eyes. Those were satisfied eyes, like after filling one\u2019s stomach with delicious food. It seemed that everything he\u2019d said so far was his honest thoughts.\u2018He isn\u2019t too bad for a member of the direct line.\u2019It was just like he\u2019d said. One always had to consider the possibility of the enemy hiding their strength. When he was an assassin, he could be called the best because he was prepared for every possibility.\u201cI see.\u201dRaon nodded to Kein and looked around the restaurant.The fifth and the sixth training grounds\u2019 trainees were now talking and laughing together like friends, all while eating the food.\u201cWhat do you think about while swinging your sword?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about thinking, I just follow my instincts. And I already told you to scram!\u201dEven Martha, who has been acting irritated, was now responding a little after hearing so many compliments. Just a little, though\u2026\u201cThat much willpower is obvious for one who aims to become a Zieghart swordsman.\u201d\u201cIndeed. A Zieghart swordsman would let his left side get stabbed after getting hit on the right side if that allowed them to achieve victory.\u201dBurren and Decal were laughing together with red faces, as if they were drunk.Munch munch.Runaan was eating fruit after finishing her conversation with Karin. It looked like she liked the fruit, since she had a bunch of them piled up in front of her, which reminded him of a squirrel.\u2018How curious.\u2019It was strange how they could become so close after fighting each other so fiercely.He thought the atmosphere was going to be as heavy as a funeral when he first heard they were going to have a feast together, but he was completely wrong. The restaurant actually felt like a small festival.\u201cYou\u2019re also weird.\u201dAs he was wondering why, Kein, who was eating a chicken, snickered.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about why those that have been fighting each other have now become so friendly?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dKein nodded, confirming his guess.\u201cShall I tell you the answer? It\u2019s because they fought each other.\u201d\u201cI know that already. But why does fighting\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not just because they fought, but because they fought under the name of Zieghart.\u201dHe pointed at the trainees that were talking about that day\u2019s battle.\u201cWe are all Zieghart. No one used underhanded methods, everyone did their best to fight in order to achieve victory. Everyone who clashed with their swords is aware of that fact.\u201dWhen Raon thought about it, it was just like he said. He could clearly feel Kein\u2019s feelings while clashing his sword with his. Victory was his only wish.\u201cSince they did everything they could, they must feel refreshed whether they lost or won. They aren\u2019t pretending to be friendly, but they actually became friends a little.\u201dHaving said that, Kein drank juice as if he was drinking a beer.\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201dHe felt like he could understand the reason that they looked so close, and why he couldn\u2019t understand it, a little.\u2018Because it wasn\u2019t like this in my previous life.\u2019The all-out battles also happened as part of training when he was being raised as an assassin.However, unlike here, the weak lost their lives despite it being training. He couldn\u2019t even think about making friends, and he thanked the fact that he could live to see another day in despair.\u2018This has to be the correct way.\u2019If people that trained in the same place under the same name fought against each other with everything they had, then the result should\u2019ve been what he was witnessing right now.However, what the instructors wanted him to be wasn\u2019t a human being but an obedient dog. Since the training was about killing each other, doubting and resenting each other was a natural outcome.\u201cYou looked so calm during the fight, just like an old warrior that had experienced all kinds of battles. Now you look your age. You\u2019re such a strange character.\u201dKein smiled while chewing on the meat. Rather than making fun of him, he seemed to be enjoying it.\u201cIs that so?\u201dRaon smiled back. Of course, the smile had a different meaning than Kein\u2019s.\u2018I really don\u2019t know anything.\u2019He was getting stronger and stronger, and his assassination technique and experience still remained in his head, but he was lacking more than anyone there in terms of humanity. It was an ashamed smile.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe sighed slowly and looked out the window. The setting sun was pressing gently on his eyes.It was probably because of the situation, or because he\u2019d heard of something that reminded him of his previous life.He recalled his old memories.It was when he didn\u2019t even have the code name Raon. The memories of the days he struggled with a dagger in his hand in order to survive were filling up his brain.The children that were running at him in order to kill him during the real battle training. He didn\u2019t even know their faces since they were wearing masks, but they might have been able to live on like this if they hadn\u2019t been taken away to that place.They would\u2019ve met friends they\u2019d gotten along with, and laughed happily, and talked to each other. They might have face difficulties, but they would\u2019ve lived a better life than dying like that. His hands trembled in grief.\u2018That\u2019s right. Everything was\u2026\u2019Derus Robert.It was because of that damned fraud that was the previous king of the south, the Sky Sword Saint. His wrath against him filled his heart after a long time.\u201cRaon?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *As Raon was grit his teeth, he heard Runaan\u2019s clear voice. He suddenly came back to his senses.Tsk, that damn brat dares to interrupt!Wrath\u2019s voice of regret was heard from his bracelet. It looked like he had slightly stimulated his emotions in the process.\u2018You are really\u2026\u2019W-wait! Why are you letting go of such a nice wrath?! Develop it even more! Don\u2019t you need to take your revenge? The King of Essence\u2026\u2018Go away already.\u2019Kuh! You bastard\u2026Raon put Wrath back into the bracelet.\u201cHaa.\u201dThere was some interference from Wrath, but those were his real emotions. He was going to kill Derus Robert, no matter what.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dHe smiled lightly at Runaan, who was staring at him, and she started eating fruit once again. She really looked like a squirrel when she was eating.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dKein, who had already finished the chicken, called his name while tapping the table.\u201cI have a suggestion.\u201d\u201cSuggestion?\u201d\u201cHow about having a match like this between the training grounds from time to time? One-on-one would also be fine, and another all-out battle like today\u2019s would be meaningful, in my opinion.\u201dThe restaurant fell silent. It seemed his voice was rather loud. The trainees that had been talking were now looking at them.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAfter looking around the children, he couldn\u2019t see anyone who disliked the idea.Martha was frowning, signaling him to decline the offer, but since she was the only one against it he didn\u2019t care about her.\u201cYeah, that sounds good.\u201d\u201cYou\u00a0are\u00a0cool, I knew it!\u201dKein hit the table and stood up.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting from now on!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose next time!\u201d\u201cWhat are you on about? We are going to win again next time, for sure!\u201dThe trainees' voices became louder. They were all rejoicing that they made new connections.\u201cGod damn it!\u201dExcept for one person.Martha swore and glared at Raon.Raon ignored her gaze and looked at the right end. The important people, the ones that could decide on Kein\u2019s suggestions, were busy with something else.\u201cWait, are you saying the food expenses here aren\u2019t the price for losing the bet?\u201d\u201cObviously not. Did I ever tell you to pay for the food because you lost the bet? I just asked you to pay.\u201d\u201cBut I already gave you money.\u201d\u201cThat was the down payment.\u201dInstead of talking about the trainees' battles or what they could\u2019ve done better, Rimmer and Metun were talking about the bet.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026\u201d\u201cThis and that are different stories. The price for the bet is usually gold coins. Well, give it to me already. Pay for the food here as well.\u201dRimmer extended his hand while grinning.\u201cYou must be the only elf with so much greed.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you for the compliment.\u201d\u201cWow. I\u2019m so angry.\u201dMetun hit Rimmer\u2019s hand with a heavy gold coin pouch.\u201cThank you, mister easy customer, I mean customer. Please do it again in the future.\u201dAfter getting the money, Rimmer stood up holding the beer glass.\u201cHey kids, you did great today. Rest well tomorrow, see you again the day after at the training ground!\u201dHe waved his hand and left the restaurant.\u2018You aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u2019Raon sneered and followed him.\u2018I can\u2019t let him be the only one benefiting from this.\u2019***\u201cI win every time I bet on Raon.\u201dRimmer was cheerfully heading over to the gambling house.\u2018Raon is my lucky boy!\u2019He was anxious because the trainees were losing one-sidedly, but in the end they met his expectations.As soon as Raon made his move, the disadvantageous situation was reversed and they achieved a perfect victory. It looked like he was never going to lose in the future as long as he kept betting on Raon.\u201cA gamble that I can win 100% of the time is a golden calf! I want to do that every day now.\u201d\u201cSuch a gamble doesn\u2019t exist in the world.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHe hurriedly turned his head at the pleasant voice coming from behind him. Raon was looking at the gold pouch in his hand coldly.\u201cR-Raon? Why are you here? You should eat more\u2026\u201d\u201cIt looks like you won a lot from betting on us.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t the first or the second time, right?\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dHe was correct both times. He did earn a lot of money thanks to Raon. Like, seriously.\u201cHalf.\u201dRaon raised his finger and pointed at the gold pouch.\u201cHalf?\u201d\u201cSince you won thanks to us, please use half of it on us.\u201d\u201cH-half would be too much!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be nothing left of it by tomorrow anyway.\u201d\u201cI might triple the money! Who knows?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you win anything at the gambling house.\u201dHe snorted. Rimmer was frustrated, but he was right. However, this time was different. He had a great feeling about it.\u201cI have a great feeling. I\u2019m going to win ten-fold, and use half of it to\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. The half is already plenty for us.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to! Everything was my\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m not going to cooperate in the future.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s obvious when the instructor is placing a bet, I might lose on purpose.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way you are going to do such a thing\u2026 Hmm.\u201dRimmer groaned. Raon\u2019s calm eyes were telling him that he was serious.\u2018D-did I go too far?\u2019Now that he thought about it, he kept winning during the spars with Burren and Martha and kept everything to himself.\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to give it to me, but I\u2019m asking to spend it on the trainees.\u201d\u201cHaa, alright. What is it? What do you need?\u201d\u201cThere was something I felt during the battle against the sixth training ground.\u201dRaon smiled slightly for the first time and continued.\u201cWhat the trainees need is\u2026\u201d***Two days later.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cA dummy?\u201d\u201cThis is a dummy used for practicing swordsmanship.\u201dThe trainees\u2019 eyes shone, looking at the training dummies placed on the left side of the training ground.\u201cA dummy for swordsmanship practice?\u201d\u201cYes. When you strike the training dummy with your sword, it returns an even stronger power. I heard it\u2019s great for preparing for actual battle.\u201d\u201cReally? But why did we get these out of nowhere?\u201dThe trainees tilted their heads, looking at the training dummy.\u201cThe instructor bought it for us.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHearing from Raon, the trainees\u2019 surprised gazes turned to Rimmer, who was lying down on the platform.\u201cYou must\u2019ve felt it during the previous battle, but you often lose the grip on your sword or gain wrist injuries because of the reaction while clashing swords with an enemy. He must\u2019ve bought it in preparation for that.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDid that gambling addict really\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat means\u2026 Did he use the money he won two days ago for this?\u201d\u201cInstructor\u2026\u201dThe trainees approached Rimmer with impressed eyes.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dEven Burren, who blatantly disliked Rimmer, opened his eyes wide in surprise.\u201cYes. Work hard with it.\u201dRimmer smiled helplessly, waving his hand.\u2018It\u2019s so damn expensive.\u2019The training dummy was more expensive than he thought. He didn\u2019t even have half the gold left after buying a few of them. Then he got angry and placed the rest in a bet and lost everything. He really ended up penniless, just like Raon had said.However, Rimmer\u2019s mouth curved up into a slight smile as he watched the trainees enjoying themselves while hitting the training dummies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInside an old-fashioned room filled with black, hardwood furniture\u2014including a bookshelf, desk, and a table\u2014the rustling sound of writing could be heard.The sound was coming from the desk.A handsome middle-aged man with long silver hair glittering like a snowfield was drawing an unknown symbol in a book full of blank pages.Mysteriously, the symbol he drew disappeared shortly after, and the book still looked as if nothing was written in it.The middle-aged man was restlessly drawing symbols.Drip.A drop of blood dripped down from the open wound on his right hand and seeped into the book.The middle-aged man stopped his hand for the first time, his gaze directed to the stain of blood coloring the white paper red.\u201cTsk.\u201dThe silver-haired middle-aged man, and the ruler of the south, the Sky Sword Saint Derus Robert clicked his tongue.\u2018It still hasn\u2019t healed up.\u2019The injury he\u2019d received on his hand seventeen years ago, when he killed a hunting dog called Raon, still hadn\u2019t disappeared.He tried using high quality elixirs, and asking famous healers or priests, but no one was capable of removing the sword wound.\u2018The wound didn\u2019t open up, though.\u2019The wound didn\u2019t get better or worse.As if it was telling him to remember, it was mysteriously keeping its initial form.\u201cAre you asking me to remember a ghost?\u201dDerus Robert snickered and stroked the wound on the back of his hand. The blood spilling out slowly started to subside.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t look back. I only keep advancing forward.\u201dHe picked up the fountain pen once again and started drawing the symbol into the book.Until the sun that was in the middle of the sky set then rose once again, Derus kept drawing the symbols non-stop, without moving from his chair.When Derus finally turned the last page, the black dragon drawn on the book cover was visible. It was drawn vividly, as if it was alive.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dDerus Robert smiled in satisfaction, looking at the completed book.\u2018There\u2019s not much left until the grand plan now.\u2019When he put his hand on the book, the eyes of the black dragon on the cover sparkled.***The new year had begun.Raon was now fifteen years old, and his appearance was the definition of the word elegant. He was sitting down where the charcoal kiln used to be with his eyes closed.The red haze kept shimmering on his shoulders endlessly, and frost kept emanating from his pores.With the heat and frost meeting each other, the misty gray haze was filling his surroundings.As if Raon wasn\u2019t aware of the mysterious phenomenon, he didn\u2019t open his eyes until the sun set under the western mountain.Raon, who looked like he had become a stone statue, finally started changing when the moon started rising.The red haze shimmering on his shoulders became a red flame, and the steam coming from his skin pores became frost.Sparkle!The moment the flame and the frost collided with each other and created a spark.Raon opened his eyes. His red eyes looked like they were struck by lightning as they pierced through the dark night.He clenched his fist and breathed out in excitement.\u201cFinally.\u201dTranslucent messages appeared above as his voice completely cracked.[One strand of the Curse of Frost has disappeared.][\u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 has reached Three-Stars.][\u2018Coldness of the Frost\u2019 has reached Three-Stars.][\u2018Perception of the Snow Flower\u2019 has reached Three-Stars.][\u2018Fire Resistance\u2019 has reached Three-Stars.][You have reached the level of Sword Expert - Beginner.][Your aura cultivation speed grows faster.][All stats have increased greatly.][Swordsmanship proficiency has increased.][Footwork proficiency has increased.]The messages appeared one after another.\u201cI\u2019ve finally reached the level of an Expert.\u201dRaon checked the messages and nodded in satisfaction.Thanks to having trained continuously despite various incidents, he managed to reach the level of an Expert one month after the new year had begun.He was only at the beginner level, which was worse than the apprentice level, but the feeling of achievement made him smile naturally.Expert? Even a Sword Master is an insignificant insect, yet you are seriously rejoicing that you became a mere Expert?Wrath snorted in dissatisfaction.\u201cIt\u2019s rare to become an Expert at the age of fifteen.\u201dExpert was indeed an excellent level, but it could hardly be called powerful on the continent\u2019s scale.However, if one reached that level at the age of fifteen, it was an achievement that could shock not only regular Houses and kingdoms, but also the Six Kings and Five Demons.Age? Only idiots count ages on a battlefield. A weakling is just a weakling, no matter how old they are.\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong. No one would be dumb enough to go easy on someone on a battlefield just because they were young.\u201dHe snickered while nodding.\u201cHowever, I have no intention of stopping just because I became an Expert.\u201dRaon pushed away Wrath\u2014who was provoking him\u2014then stood up.\u2018It\u2019s light.\u2019Probably because one strand of the shackle of ice that always pressured him had disappeared, his body felt as light as a leaf and was full of energy.\u201cStatus window.\u201dRaon opened up the status window after trying to move his body a little.Status WindowName: Raon Zieghart.Title: First Victory.State: Curse of Frost (Five Strands)Trait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Four-Stars), Water Resistance (Four-Stars), Perception of the Snow Flower (Three-Stars), Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation (Three-Stars), Coldness of the Frost (Three-Stars), Fire Resistance (Three-Stars), Bleeding Curse (One-Stars).__Strength: 55Agility: 56Stamina: 57Energy: 40Perception: 62As soon as he saw the status window, the corners of his lips raised. The \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, the \u2018Coldness of the Frost\u2019 and the \u2018Fire Resistance\u2019 had leveled up, and his stats had also increased significantly.It wasn\u2019t just the numbers. His mana circuit had also expanded, increasing the amount and speed of the aura he could control.\u2018I\u2019m at the beginner level of Expert, but I should be on par with someone at the apprentice level.\u2019The thought of possessing a might stronger than the level or number that was displayed made him unconsciously clench his fists.How pathetic. You are at a level that can\u2019t even handle one finger, no, not even a fingernail of the King of the Essence.\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201dRaon smiled.But why are you smiling?\u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t even have said it was a fingernail before. Wasn\u2019t that your way of acknowledging my growth?\u201dThere\u2019s no way the King of Essence would acknowledge a mere human!\u201cI must be right since your voice is trembling slightly. Since we\u2019ve been together for a long time, I can tell what you are thinking to some extent.\u201dA human that tries to read the King of Essence\u2019s mind deserves to be crunched to the bones!Wrath\u2019s coldness burst out like a tidal wave.Whir!Raon used the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, which had reached three stars, to completely melt Wrath\u2019s coldness.\u201cIs that all? If you don\u2019t recover your strength soon, I\u2019m going to eat you.\u201dHmph! Listening to your nonsense reminds me of the old days. Back in devildom, the King of Essence had demon visitors that tried picking a fi\u2026\u201cAh, I should go warm up.\u201dWhere are you going? Listen to the King of Essence!* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cTraining is finished.\u201d\u201cThank you for your effort.\u201dAt Rimmer\u2019s voice, Raon lowered his head while breathing heavily.\u201cThank you for your effort!\u201dThe trainees also repeated their thanks after Raon.\u201cYou are welcome.\u201dRimmer waved his hand while grinning. It looked like a halfhearted response stemming from his laziness, but it was actually his way of greeting.\u2018It looks like everyone\u2019s gotten used to it now.\u2019Raon nodded slightly, watching Rimmer, the instructors, and the trainees.After spending over three years together, everyone had gotten pretty close.Even Burren and Martha, who hated him the most, now realized what kind of person Rimmer was and were softer towards him.\u201cInstructor. Since you were twenty minutes late today, shouldn\u2019t you train us twenty minutes longer?\u201dOf course, he still didn\u2019t compromise on his tardiness.\u201cLet\u2019s do that tomorrow. We\u2019ve done enough for today.\u201dRimmer smiled awkwardly and went down from the platform. Judging from the way he was stepping backwards, he was about to run away after changing the subject.\u201cThe ones on duty should start cleaning up the training ground.\u201dRaon murmured that he was always the same and turned around to give the cleanup orders.\u201cUnderstood!\u201dDorian, who was on duty, energetically nodded and ran to the corner that the cleaning materials had been placed.\u201cEek!\u201dWhile opening the toolbox, he noticed who was standing next to him and screamed.\u201cWhat? Do you have a problem with me being on duty?\u201dMartha, whose black hair was flowing down her shoulders, furrowed her brows.\u201cN-not at all. I\u2019m absolutely! Honored\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dShe clicked her tongue and took the equipment for hardening the training ground\u2019s floor, starting her work before Dorian.The Martha from before would\u2019ve left the chores to the collaterals or the recommended children and headed over to the direct line training herself. However, she couldn\u2019t escape the cleanup duty anymore because of Raon\u2019s orders.\u201cWhat are you watching? I have to clean up, so disappear somewhere else!\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dMartha stomped her feet and the ground trembled. The trainees that were staring at her in a daze hurriedly ran to the exit.\u201cEek!\u201dDorian, who was standing next to her, collapsed on the ground in shock.\u201cShe\u2019s still the same. It seems you are the only one she is acting differently towards.\u201dRaon turned his head to the voice behind him. Rimmer was approaching him with a silly snicker.\u201cDidn\u2019t you run away because of Burren\u2019s scolding?\u201d\u201cAh, I came back since there\u2019s something I forgot.\u201d\u201cForg\u2026\u201d\u201cAttention, everyone!\u201dWhen Rimmer clapped his hands, the trainees, who were running away from Martha\u2019s shout, all stopped to listen to him.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dWhen the trainees came near him, Rimmer went up onto the platform once again.\u201cI forgot something really important.\u201dHe smiled awkwardly and scratched the back of his head.\u201cWhat is it again?\u201d\u201cAh, you\u2019ve got a second mission.\u201dThe whole training ground fell silent in an instant.\u201cMission!\u201d\u201cHow can you forget about that?\u201d\u201cThat guy is serious\u2026?\u201dSince they couldn\u2019t imagine he could forget about a mission, the trainees ground their teeth.\u201cMission, huh\u2026\u201dRaon closed his eyes.\u2018It took longer than I thought.\u2019Since they had successfully completed their first mission, he thought they were going to get their second mission sooner. However, over a half a year had passed since then.It looked like the missions weren\u2019t that frequent for the trainees.\u2018It\u2019s either the way Zieghart is raising their children is softer than I thought, or the mission is incredibly difficult.\u2019It was one of the two, but he personally hoped for the latter. That would allow him to grow up faster.\u201cIt seems orcs have appeared near Cebu village, located in the southeast of Zieghart.\u201dRimmer pointed towards Cebu village in the air. It was obvious that he didn\u2019t bring a map because he was too lazy.\u201cGetting rid of the orcs that are threatening people at Cebu village, and protecting the village is your mission. In short, it\u2019s a village protection and monster extermination mission.\u201d\u201cOrc!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s monster extermination!\u201dMonster extermination was the easiest and simplest mission compared to escort or dungeon exploration missions. Since it was easier than their first mission, the bandit extermination, the trainees cheered out loud.\u201cYou are stupid for being happy about a mission.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue and continued.\u201cUnlike the first mission, the instructors won\u2019t come along. You guys will be the only ones going to Cebu village. Thinking and making decisions by yourselves from the beginning to the end isn\u2019t going to be as easy as you think.\u201d\u201cI have a question.\u201dBurren raised his hand.\u201cWhat were you even thinking, to actually forget to tell us about a mission that we will be doing by ourselves?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s not a question, but a reprimand.\u201dRimmer broke out into a cold sweat.\u201cHaa!\u201dBurren\u2019s face wrinkled like tree bark, and he sighed heavily.\u201cThen I will ask the real question. Since you said we will be the only ones moving out, what shall we do if we meet a critical situation we can\u2019t handle by ourselves?\u201cRecognizing that is also your job. If the mission is deemed impossible, giving up on it and deciding to return is also your ability. Therefore\u2026\u201dRimmer\u2019s gaze glanced around the trainees, then stopped at Raon.\u201cThe leader\u2019s ability is important once again. You have to decide whether you have to break through with power, devise a strategy, or run away without looking back upon facing a critical situation.\u201d\u201cI-isn\u2019t it going to be a problem if we run away from a mission?\u201dDorian raised his hand this time.\u201cIt depends. If you run away from goblins, you will lose points and be disgraced. If you manage to run away from one of the Five Demons, then you deserve to be praised.\u201d\u201cOhh!\u201dDorian exclaimed, hearing that he was allowed to run away. His cowardly personality remained the same in the new year.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dBurren eventually looked at Raon. With his eyes slightly shining, his expression was that of acknowledgement and slight envy.\u201cYou will be departing the daybreak after tomorrow. You shall rest for today and tomorrow while thoroughly preparing for the mission.\u201d\u201cW-w-wait! In two days?\u201dDorian\u2019s eyes flicked left and right like a grasshopper.\u201cYes. In two days.\u201d\u201cWhy is it at such short notice?! That\u2019s way too early! Since today is almost over, we\u2019ve only got one day left!\u201d\u201cMonster extermination is an urgent mission compared to escorts or dungeon explorations. If you end up being late, Cebu village will be the one suffering casualties.\u201d\u201cThen you should have told us earlier!\u201dBurren exploded again and stomped the ground.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThe day after tomorrow\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dRaon\u2019s low voice pierced through the center of the training ground.\u201cThe instructor told us before. You can\u2019t predict when and what kind of mission you will get. Instead of being flustered and criticizing him about it, you should be preparing for the mission. The more you criticize, the more you will be played by the instructors\u2019 hands.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s make our move for now.\u201dThe trainees that were angry like Burren nodded, and Rimmer smiled in satisfaction.\u201cI\u2019m going to pluck off those ears one day.\u201dMartha murmured something Wrath had already said before and ground her teeth.Runaan looked like none of it mattered as she stood blankly, licking her lips. She seemed to be thinking about the ice cream she would eat once she returned home.\u201cA wild orc is fiercer and sturdier than the orc you faced during battle training.\u201d\u201cSince they are also bigger in numbers, it will be a fight of one versus many. Since we\u2019ve learned footwork, it will be more advantageous for us to focus on evading rather than blocking. Make your equipment as light as possible and gather here at daybreak in two days.\u201dAfter saying that, Raon turned around.\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dRunaan nodded like a baby bird and Martha clicked her tongue, then left the training ground.\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe trainees that followed Raon answered loud and clear, then ran towards the dormitory.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren glared at the instructors for a moment, but he turned around without saying anything. The collaterals followed him towards the main building.\u201cHe really looks like a leader now.\u201dRimmer grinned with his arms crossed. Of course, he was saying that looking while at Raon\u2019s back.\u201cI know, right?\u201d\u201cI never imagined he would change that much.\u201d\u201cHe is also open-minded, probably because he started from rock bottom.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen many children so far, but it\u2019s my first time seeing a top trainee that managed to make the others follow him based on his efforts, rather than his position or talent.\u201dThe instructors approached Rimmer and nodded. All of them also acknowledged Raon.\u201cHmm, I should prepare as well. I need to start moving before the children.\u201dThe youngest instructor licked his lips while watching the children walk away.They used to really send the trainees on a mission on their own, but ever since Glenn broke through the demonic wall, the second mission\u2019s rules included having instructors tag along secretly.\u201cNo.\u201dRimmer tapped the youngest instructor\u2019s shoulder, then shook his head.\u201cI\u2019ll be going.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhaat?\u201d\u201cA-are you serious?\u201dThe instructors\u2019 eyes widened. They couldn\u2019t believe the man that found teaching them bothersome was volunteering to follow them on a mission.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut head instructor, if you don\u2019t get there in time when the children are in danger because you were napping\u2026\u201d\u201cEep! Who do you think I am? Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201dRimmer flapped his hand, but the instructors didn\u2019t respond. That was because they could count on their fingers the number of times Rimmer wasn\u2019t late to a training period.\u201cAnyway! I\u2019ll be going, so you can rest easy.\u201dRimmer turned around after saying that. They could hear him murmur that he was going to have a great nap as he left the training ground.\u201cHe should sleep here if he wants to sleep. Why does he even want to follow them on a mission\u2026?\u201d\u201cI guess he\u2019s leaving since the head of house and the other division leaders will bother him if he stays here.\u201d\u201cHah\u2026\u201dThe instructors snorted, realizing Rimmer\u2019s plans.\u201cHis laziness is really amazing.\u201d***Even though the mission was going to start in two days, Raon returned to the dormitory after finishing up his night training.A backpack with lightweight magic cast on it was placed in front of the room. It seemed to be a bag prepared for the mission.\u2018He is really being obvious that he doesn\u2019t care.\u2019That kind of bag was normally handed down personally, but putting it in front of the room was his way of telling him to take care of his own business since he didn\u2019t care.\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dRaon snickered and entered the room holding the bag. It didn\u2019t matter whether the instructors followed or not. He just needed to complete the mission perfectly, regardless of what it was.Such arrogance. Do you believe everything in the world will go your way? There are countless unexpected circumstances that can happen against you.\u2018Well, that\u2019s true.\u2019Raon nodded. Just as Wrath said, anything could happen at any time. However, since he could handle most problems by himself, he couldn\u2019t relate to that too much.\u2018You\u2019re telling me that something unexpected can happen, like how you lost to me.\u2019I really want to tear your mouth off.\u2018That\u2019s an impossible wish.\u2019Raon snickered and started to pack his bag. Since he was given a light bag, packing up wasn\u2019t really difficult.Knock knock.As he was in the middle of packing up, a knocking sound could be heard.\u2018Who is it?\u2019He opened the door, thinking that it was strange since everyone should\u2019ve been busy preparing for departure.\u201cEek!\u201dRaon\u2019s jaw dropped with his eyes widened. There were the only two people in the world that could fluster him. Sylvia and Helen were standing there, faces turning red.\u201cRaon! If you are going on a mission, you should return to the annex building and tell Mom about it!\u201d\u201cHow did you know that? No way, was it Dorian again?\u201d\u201cSir Rimmer told us!\u201dPutting her hands on her hips, Sylvia frowned.\u2018That elf, seriously\u2026\u2019He secretly sighed. He came to the dormitory on purpose to prevent Sylvia and Helen from worrying. He didn\u2019t think he would visit them personally to tell them about it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt would\u2019ve been a different story if he could have kept it a secret, but since they had already realized, he didn\u2019t need to make up an excuse. It was a fact that he was avoiding them since it could get awkward if he told them he was going on a mission without an instructor, despite having time to visit them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSylvia pouted without saying anything and wrinkled her nose. As he was about to close his eyes in preparation for her long preaching, he heard her voice.\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThe top trainee isn\u2019t only supposed to greet others. It\u2019s a position that should lead the other trainees in a better direction.\u201dSylvia\u2019s eyes were full of unusual seriousness.\u201cNot just yourself, but you should think about everyone before you act. The children\u2019s lives are at stake based on your decisions.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201dRaon nodded with a bewildered expression.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect her to say something like this\u2026\u2019He thought he would get scolded and preached at. He didn\u2019t expect her to give such advice.\u201cMonster extermination might look easy, but it\u2019s actually a difficult mission. Make sure to wipe them out completely so that the villagers won\u2019t suffer any more.\u201dSylvia was correct. Since the monsters multiplied very quickly, it was important to completely root them out when he was at it.\u201cAlways keep in mind that the moment you are on a mission, you aren\u2019t a trainee anymore but a Zieghart swordsman.\u201dShe lowered her body to meet his eyes. Her eyes were shining like stars.\u201cMom told you before, right? The first Zieghart knew honor and shame, and was the kind of person that pointed his sword at the strong in order to protect the weak. Mom wants Raon to act like that Zieghart ancestor.\u201dSylvia smiled, gently caressing Raon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAren\u2019t you angry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m angry! And I\u2019m worried! I feel so frustrated! However!\u201dHer expression changed in an instant. She pouted once again.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right time to scold you. Be ready for some preaching once you return.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRaon smiled lightly and nodded. Since Sylvia had also lived as a swordsman, she was well aware that now wasn\u2019t the right time to scold him.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you became happier after starting to train, but I can\u2019t stop worrying about you.\u201dSylvia hugged Raon tightly. He could feel her worries in her trembling hands.She returned after giving him a few more pieces of advice. She didn\u2019t take as much of his time as he had expected, and she didn\u2019t scold him either.While worrying about her son, she hoped he would complete the mission properly as a swordsman.That\u2019s why her voice and her words touched him deep in his heart.While packing up his bag, he looked out the window. The moonlight was permeating the room, as if it were jealous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anything can happen outside the house. You must doubt over and over. If you think it\u2019s too difficult, retreat without a second thought.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHis gaze was directed at Raon, who was standing at the first row. Raon calmly nodded.\u201cThen go now. It would normally take a month, but you should be able to arrive in two weeks since we\u2019ve opened the Official Broad Road. I wish you good fortune in battle.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands, just like in their usual training. The trainees bowed to him and the instructors, then turned around.\u201cLine up in four columns. We will be moving in the buddy groups assigned in the morning.\u201dThe trainees moved in a perfect order at Raon\u2019s command.\u201cHah.\u201dRimmer snorted while watching them.\u2018Did he make buddy groups?\u2019Despite being a top trainee, he was still a teenager. He was surprised at his composure and him organizing buddy groups when he should\u2019ve been nervous about going on a mission without an instructor.\u2018He always surprises me.\u2019He never got bored of watching Raon. He always filled him with anticipation.\u2018The most surprising thing was the Nine Flowers Medicine.\u2019His jaw had automatically dropped from surprise upon watching Raon take the Nine Flowers Medicine he got as a reward for winning against Martha.I never expected him to completely absorb it.\u2019Upon taking an elixir, some energy was inevitably wasted. Getting someone else\u2019s help to reduce that waste to a minimum was the common method of taking an elixir, yet Raon had absorbed all of the energy on his own. He was a monstrous guy in many ways.\u2018I guess they will be fine.\u2019On top of might and aura, Raon was exceptionally talented with perception. Since he had proved himself during the battle against the sixth training ground, he was going to return safely after completing the mission without much difficulty.\u201cWe\u2019ve finished the preparation.\u201dRaon came to Rimmer after finishing lining up the trainees. His serene eyes didn\u2019t have any sign of excitement or nervousness.\u2018How is he fifteen years old\u2026\u2019Rimmer nodded, while feeling goosebumps on his arm.\u201cGo to battle.\u201d\u201cTo battle.\u201dHe responded silently and left the training ground, leading the trainees.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRimmer stared at the backs of the trainees he\u2019d raised for the past three years.The instructors approached him once the trainees had completely disappeared.\u201cHead instructor, shouldn\u2019t you start following them now?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRimmer shook his head. He yawned while grabbing the back of his neck with clasped hands.\u201cThere\u2019s a guy with an inhuman perception. I\u2019m going to take a nap first.\u201dHe went to the head instructor\u2019s office after saying that.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d\u201cI-is that okay?\u201d\u201cIt might be late, but shouldn\u2019t we go after them?\u201dThe instructors\u2019 worrying voices could be heard from behind him, but Rimmer smiled, pretending to not hear them.\u2018I should worry about the orcs instead of them.\u2019***Raon looked back while walking at the front. The forty-two trainees were moving in four lines, but they were divided into three factions.The first was the collateral faction with Burren Zieghart as center. The collaterals were following Burren as their master.The second was a faction of vassal families that opposed the collaterals. However, Runaan\u2014who should\u2019ve been their center\u2014was sticking next to Raon, which made their stance rather awkward.The third was the recommended children with commoner backgrounds. Raon had helped them back when they were temporary trainees, and they were still following him.Finally, Martha was the exception that didn\u2019t belong anywhere.After checking each trainee\u2019s expressions, Raon closed his eyes.Honestly, he didn't care what they did or what they became.Despite his status as a trainee under the Zieghart name, he didn\u2019t think he belonged to that place. He was going to leave after returning Sylvia to her position in the direct line.However.The spar against the Owen Kingdom, the first mission, and the battle against the sixth training ground made him realize that wasn\u2019t all there was to it.Since he spent a long time with them, sharing the same thoughts, he grew a bit attached to them.\u2018And Mom\u2019s words are also bothering me.\u2019Sylvia\u2019s voice, telling him to act like the ancient Zieghart swordsman as the top trainee, was still engraved in his heart.\u2018It\u2019s difficult.\u2019Probably because he had lived as an assassin, taking care of his allies was more difficult than killing and destroying his enemies.\u201cWe\u2019re going to rest here.\u201dRaon stopped in front of a huge tree, thick enough that five grown men wouldn\u2019t be enough to hug it together. The trainees sat down, leaning their backs against the tree.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dAs the trainees were drinking water and catching their breath, he stood in front of them.\u201cSome of you might dislike me, but I\u2019m currently your top trainee.\u201dHis calm voice stating the fact made some people clench their fists, some nod their heads, and others didn\u2019t show any reaction at all.\u201cI knew that some of you aren\u2019t taking it seriously or are excited, like you\u2019re going on a picnic, despite hearing that it\u2019s a monster extermination. Whatever you think is up to you, but that lightheartedness will make you or the person behind you into a casualty.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe trainees that had such thoughts lowered their heads in embarrassment.\u201cJust as the head instructor said, we don\u2019t know what might happen during the mission. Don\u2019t act rashly, follow my orders.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dRunaan and the recommended children answered loud and clear, and Martha and the vassal family trainees nodded.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe collateral trainees stayed still, trying to read Burren\u2019s mind.\u201cOf course.\u201dBurren stood up while pouring water on his head.\u201cI already told you at the end of the battle against the sixth training ground, but I acknowledge you as the top trainee. I\u2019ll follow your order even if it might cost my life, as long as it is reasonable. However, if it will stain the Zieghart name, I won\u2019t follow your order.\u201d\u201cWhat is worthy of Zieghart, according to you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s knowing the honor of a swordsman. Helping the weak, acting proudly in front of the strong, and training with everything they have, so they won\u2019t show any shameful sight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon met Burren\u2019s eyes without saying anything.\u201cI know. I picked a fight against you out of jealousy, and stained the Zieghart name, unable to accept the result. I\u2019m telling you all this because I am well aware of that fact. I\u2019m never going to display that shameful behavior ever again.\u201dBurren hit his chest with his clenched fist. It felt like his willpower could be seen in his green eyes, burning strongly.\u2018He has really changed a lot.\u2019He acknowledged his own mistake in front of that many people, and even declared his resolution. It wasn\u2019t something a fifteen-year-old would do.\u201cI got it.\u201dRaon nodded. It seemed he could trust Burren since he had changed that much. Putting the water he was drinking back in his bag, he turned around.\u201cLet\u2019s move again.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Burren looked at Raon, who was advancing through the snowy road. He had a small back. It had a size befitting his age, since he had somewhat recovered his health, but he was still small compared to the other trainees\u2014including himself.\u2018And yet\u2026\u2019His size as a person was incomparable to the other trainees.He painfully realized that while observing him as they moved for the mission. The patience he displayed during training was nothing.Raon didn\u2019t get tired. No, he didn\u2019t show it despite being tired.The trainees struggled with the cold and exhaustion, but he was always composed and relaxed. Thanks to that, the trainees that were following him became less nervous and ended up expending less stamina.\u2018If he was the only one on the mission, he probably would\u2019ve arrived a long time ago\u2026\u2019It definitely wasn\u2019t a baseless guess.Raon always took a night watch despite being the top trainee. He was also the only one who didn\u2019t doze off during it.\u2018He must\u2019ve gotten stronger, too.\u2019Since it was half a year ago that he defeated Kein from the direct line, who was two years older than him, he must\u2019ve gotten even stronger. He probably reached the advanced level Sword User, or even the highest level.Honestly, he couldn\u2019t help but think that he could never win against him.\u2018But I won\u2019t give up.\u2019He didn\u2019t work as hard as Raon yet and giving up on matching up to his rival wasn\u2019t something a Zieghart would do.Burren tightly gripped his sword\u2019s handle.He came back to his senses thanks to Raon. He was going to catch up to him to return the favor.\u2018Just you wait, Raon Zieghart.\u2019***Like a peacock fluttering its feathers, the different colored roofs were mingling in harmony. They were the rainbow roofs that were Cebu village\u2019s pride.Raon and the trainees, who had reached Cebu village in two weeks, were looking down at the village from the hill.\u201cWe can see it over there.\u201d\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d\u201cPhew. We can finally sleep inside.\u201dThe trainees, who were tired of sleeping outside, smiled while patting their shoulders and backs.\u201cCebu village\u2026\u201dIt was his first time there, but he investigated it a little because of the mission. It was a small village where a small number of people lived off farming without any special products or tourist attractions.Since monsters came down once every few years, it wasn\u2019t really a special mission. In fact, there were wooden fences installed around the village in order to stop the monsters from coming in.\u201cLet\u2019s go down.\u201dRaon nodded after looking around the village and the mountains surrounding it as a whole.\u201cYes!\u201dThe trainees tightened their bags and went down the mountain, following Raon.\u2018Hmm?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes and lowered his head slightly.\u2018What?\u2019He felt chills running down his back. It was the sensation he felt every day when he was being trained as an assassin: a human\u2019s gaze.\u2018Instructor? No, it\u2019s different.\u2019It was different from an instructor\u2019s gaze, as they observed them while knowing who they were. It was the frightening feeling of someone trying to find out everything about them.\u2018No one knows.\u2019The trainees\u2019 faces were stiff with nervousness over fighting monsters. Even Burren, Martha, and Runaan looked like they didn\u2019t sense anything.\u2018I guess that\u2019s normal.\u2019It was a faint feeling that he himself wouldn\u2019t have felt if he didn\u2019t have the experience of an assassin. It would\u2019ve been strange if the trainees could sense it.He rolled his eyes while lowering his head. He couldn\u2019t locate it since his aura and his perception was still too weak.\u2018Not good.\u2019He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was one of the house\u2019s trials or some other crisis. Hiding was the best course of action in such a situation.Raon went down the mountain without saying anything. As he was purposely walking slowly, the feeling scanning his neck got further away.It seemed like it was running away to report elsewhere. Now was the time.Whir.Creating a thin layer with his aura to prevent the sound from going out, he turned around.\u201cBurren.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBurren raised his head, hiding his nervousness under his calm expression.\u201cDuring this mission, you shall be the top trainee and issue commands.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying out of nowhere\u2026?\u201d\u201cSince Runaan and I did everything during the first mission, you should take on the main role this time. Prove what you told me last time was true.\u201d\u201cBy what I told you, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThat you are going to be worthy of being a Zieghart swordsman.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren bit his lip. Judging from his frowning expression, he was taking him seriously.The trainees were walking silently, but their ears and gazes were all directed to Raon and Burren.\u201cAlright.\u201dBurren slowly nodded. Hesitation had disappeared from his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll clearly show you that I\u2019ve changed. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHe put on the pace while shouting out loud. The collaterals following Burren were full of energy.\u201cYou heard that too, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe trainees that usually followed Raon nodded at once.\u201cRunaan.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan understood right away and looked at the vassal family trainees that followed her.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe vassal families frowned, displeased with the way Burren was getting power, but eventually nodded.\u201cMartha, I\u2019ll tell you the reason later, so consider Burren as the top trainee for now.\u201dLastly, he turned to look at Martha, who was standing next to him. She closed her eye and opened it again with a cold expression.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me. I already said I\u2019d follow your command, so you just have to show me the results.\u201dMartha spoke and walked towards Burren.Are the young bastards changing a little?Wrath\u2019s somewhat displeased voice could be heard quietly.What arrogance!His personality was indeed the worst, as he got angry at everything and anything.\u2018You can feel the one that is observing us nearby, right?\u2019Did you notice that? I guess, since you have the King of Essence\u2019s trait, you should bite your tongue and die if you don't.\u2018Where are they? And how many are they?\u2019Do you think the King of Essence would tell you his location?\u2018So, it\u2019s one person.\u2019Huh?\u2018Since you can\u2019t tell lies, \u2018his\u2019 means one person.\u2019Y-you bastard\u2026Wrath trembled, boiling in anger.\u2018Even then, there\u2019s a problem\u2026\u2019There was only one person observing them, but there was no way of telling how many they had as allies. He couldn\u2019t relax until the end.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon licked his lips, looking at Cebu village\u2019s wooden fence as it started entering his sight.\u2018I have a feeling this mission isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was an old man with gray hair, which showed the many years he had lived.\u201cOh! Are you people from Zieghart?\u201dThe wariness filling his angry eyes subsided upon seeing the burning sword emblem engraved on the trainees\u2019 chests.\u201cYes, we are.\u201dBurren, who was at the front, nodded.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally arrived! Please wait a moment!\u201dAfter a thumping noise, the door opened at the left side of the wooden fence.\u201cI\u2019m Ligaham, the Cebu village chief. We welcome the Zieghart\u2019s swordsmen!\u201dIt seemed the gray-haired old man was the village chief as he came up and bowed. The villagers holding swords and spears could be seen behind him.\u201cWe are just trainees that aren\u2019t swordsmen yet.\u201dLigaham and the villagers strictly bowed to the trainees, who looked clearly young, which meant the Zieghart\u2019s name was famous in the village.\u201cHmph.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026\u201dThe trainees couldn\u2019t hide their pleasure at the hospitality they\u2019ve got for the first time. It was the typical display of an inexperienced beginner.Raon hid his presence, standing in the middle of the trainees. He was carefully observing his surroundings. He tried looking for the gaze he felt in the forest, but he couldn\u2019t feel it anymore. It seemed the one observing them was gone.He already ran away.\u2018It looks like it.\u2019Wrath sometimes gave him the answer out of frustration. He was a very useful guy, except for the times he tried to attack him.\u201cPlease rest for now, since you must be tired from the long trip.\u201dChief Ligaham raised his hand to volunteer as a guide for the trainees.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dBurren stopped moving after entering the village.\u201cI\u2019m going to ask about the situation first. Please tell us about the monsters\u2019 movements.\u201d\u201cYou are a Zieghart after all, despite being a trainee.\u201dThe village chief nodded, a deeply moved expression on his face.\u201cHmm!\u201dBurren squared his shoulders at hearing that his actions were worthy of Zieghart. He had returned to being a child after acting all dignified.\u201cPlease, look that way.\u201dThe village chief pointed at the mountain on the right side.\u201cThat mountain is Cebu Mountain, which has the same name as our village. Monsters appear there every year, but we\u2019ve been dealing with them since they\u2019ve been few in number. However, the number multiplied more than three times this year, and they were too much for us.\u201d\u201cHow many would they be then?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve observed more than a hundred of them. Taking into account those we haven\u2019t seen yet, it\u2019s safe to assume they are over two hundred.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred, I see.\u201dBurren nodded, looking at Cebu Mountain.\u201cPlease, rest easy. We are going to annihilate the monsters living in that mountain.\u201d\u201cOhh!\u201d\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201dThe villagers bowed at Burren and the trainees, as if the monsters had already been wiped out.\u201cPlease, get up. Cebu is a village under Zieghart\u2019s influence, therefore it\u2019s our job to take care of those monsters.\u201dBurren\u2019s face turned red with excitement, but he turned around without showing it on the outside.\u201cSince it\u2019s already late today, we are going to head to the mountain tomorrow at daybreak, before the monsters wake.\u201d\u201cThen for your rest\u2026\u201d\u201cBefore that.\u201dThe village chief\u2019s voice was interrupted by Burren once again.\u201cPlease prepare a fast person to guide us on the mountain tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOf course. Please, come this way.\u201dOverwhelmed by Burren\u2019s atmosphere, the village chief immediately nodded and started guiding them to the village hall.\u2018Not bad.\u2019Raon nodded, watching the exchange between Burren and the village chief.I know, right? I thought that bloody-eyed brat would\u2019ve asked him to kneel as soon as he arrived.Wrath murmured that it was a shame.\u2018Do you think everyone is like you?\u2019Honestly, Raon thought the same thing as Wrath. He thought Burren was going to abuse his power, but he was only thinking about the mission, and he treated him with some respect.\u2018However, that\u2019s not the important part.\u2019Burren and the trainees could deal with the monsters like orcs, goblins, and kobolds without his help.The important part was the scanning gaze that he felt as soon as he arrived near Cebu village. He couldn\u2019t be sure, but the gaze had disappeared in the direction of the mountain.\u2018I\u2019ll find out tomorrow.\u2019Whether it was a House trial, or some other organization preparing something.After looking around Cebu Mountain as a whole, Raon entered the village hall last.***At the peak of Cebu Mountain, monster footprints of various sizes were haphazardly stamped into the snow covering the ground like a blanket.However, not a single monster could be seen, and one young man was sitting on a rock.Swoosh.While the man was spinning an orc shaped helmet with his finger, a suspicious man covering his head with a green mask surged out from the ground.\u201cWho are the ones that arrived?\u201d\u201cThey are Ziegharts.\u201dThe green masked man responded while bowing.\u201cZieghart? I didn\u2019t feel such a presence.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t look like official swordsmen, just trainees.\u201d\u201cAny instructors?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t find any.\u201d\u201cAha, it\u2019s their second mission.\u201dThe young man snickered, tapping the helmet.\u201cYou didn\u2019t get found out, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. They shouldn\u2019t even have realized I was nearby.\u201d\u201cI guess. There\u2019s no way mere trainees could notice your stealth.\u201dHe nodded and licked his lips.\u201cWe\u2019ve made sure to control the monsters, so why did they have to come here?\u201d\u201cBecause the villagers are sensitive to change. They must\u2019ve asked for help from Zieghart, noticing the increase in monsters\u2019 numbers. It seems we were too reckless because we thought we could find the item soon enough.\u201dThe young man clicked his tongue, tilting his head back.\u201cSince we didn\u2019t manage to find it after searching through the mountain, the \u2018magic stone\u2019 must be inside the village.\u201d\u201cThat must be the case.\u201d\u201cAre we going to attack immediately?\u201dThe man grabbed the helmet he was spinning and shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cPardon? But it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to kill the Zieghart\u2019s sprouts\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to kill them, but Zieghart might find out about the magic stone\u2019s existence if we mess around with them. It will be a loss for us if we end up losing something bigger while chasing a small gain.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cLet them have some monsters. That way, the Zieghart younglings can complete their mission splendidly and return home.\u201dThe man put the green helmet on his head. The helmet had buck teeth and frightening eyes carved on it like an orc\u2019s head, and a threatening murderous intent was coming from those eyes.\u201cWe will attack Cebu village after they return. Kill them all without exception.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The next day at daybreak.Raon was waiting near the entrance of Cebu Mountain along with the trainees.\u2018He\u2019s here.\u2019As soon as he came near the mountain, the gaze he had felt the day before had appeared once again.\u2018Is it coming from the west?\u2019Thanks to having felt it already the day before, he managed to get a rough idea of his location. It seemed he was in the west.\u2018It doesn\u2019t look like he is intending to come out right now.\u2019Raon closed his eyes and widened his perception to search the mountain. Presences big and small: they were the movements of the orcs, goblins, and kobolds that the village chief had mentioned.Since his senses as an assassin didn\u2019t notice anything, it didn\u2019t seem like there was any danger. However, he kept his senses open just in case.\u201cAfter examination, we\u2019ve confirmed orcs, goblins, and kobolds.\u201dBurren turned around to meet every trainee\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe orcs have the stronger combat abilities, but as you\u2019ve learned, the goblins and kobolds use dirty techniques like poison darts and poison smoke. You should never underestimate them.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe trainees responded quietly since the monsters could pop out at any moment.\u201cThe most efficient method is to move in groups, but since we lack actual combat experience, we are going to move together in order to support each other.\u201dHe looked at Raon after saying that. His eyes were asking for permission.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon slightly nodded without saying anything. Burren thanked him with his eyes and turned around once again.\u201cShow the monsters threatening our land the power of Zieghart!\u201dBurren drew his sword and ran up the mountain.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cWaaaa!\u201dGiving out a loud war cry, the trainees followed Burren.Runaan and Martha went into the mountain after checking Raon\u2019s gaze one last time.What a bunch of idiots.Wrath snorted, watching the trainees running in.Are they really shouting out loud after practicing surprise attacks until now? They are so pathetic.It was pretty much the first real battle for the trainees. That much of a mistake was understandable.It should be your first monster extermination as well. What\u2019s wrong with your heartbeat?Wrath\u2019s voice was full of irritation.It sounds like an old general\u2019s heartbeat, one who has experienced hundreds of battlefields. Instead of looking right in front of you, you are seeing many different things. That heavy sound really annoys me.\u2018It\u2019s because I\u2019m special.\u2019Raon grinned and unsheathed his sword.\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dThe brown-haired young man nodded, his chin trembling. He was the villager chosen as the guide. Raon\u2019s job was the protection of the guide, instead of fighting the monsters.\u201cRoar!\u201d\u201cKiee!\u201dUpon reaching the source of screams, they were already in the middle of a battle.\u201cStop the orcs, kill the goblins and kobolds first!\u201dFollowing Burren\u2019s command, the trainees on the frontline crossed their swords with the orcs, and the trainees on the back dashed ahead to slash at the goblins and the kobolds.The green wall made of monsters collapsed in an instant.There were three exceptional people among the trainees that were slaughtering the monsters.Burren\u2019s sword, imbued with the energy of the wind, was singlehandedly splitting the orcs\u2019 axe. Runaan was controlling the approaching monsters with frost, then cutting their throats.And finally, Martha\u2026Wham!She was destroying everything in front of her, imbuing her sword with a tremendous amount of aura.At that rate, they were going to wipe out every monster in the mountain without much difficulty, even if he didn\u2019t interfere.\u201cGrrrr!\u201dWhile Raon was spreading his perception, two orcs that had escaped the trainees\u2019 encirclement ran towards him holding an axe.\u201cHieee!\u201dAt the scent of blood coming from the orcs, the guide collapsed, unable to control his trembling legs.Slash!Raon stood in front of him and swung his sword.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dAs the sword containing red energy slashed through the air, the orcs' heads fell like fruit falling from a tree.\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBurren swallowed after watching the scene, and Martha\u2019s black eyes shone.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dRaon grabbed the guide\u2019s hand, the man\u2019s mouth wide open, to help him stand up.\u201cI will return you to the village without a single injury.\u201d***It was the worst morning ever for Kanbar, who was twenty-five years old now. That was because he was chosen to be the guide for the punitive force.\u2018Is it going to be fine?\u2019He couldn\u2019t stop worrying about it.He was thankful for Zieghart\u2019s punitive force coming to help the village, but they looked way too young.Moreover, the swordsman that came with him to protect him looked even younger than any of them.His handsome appearance was bewildering, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to trust him because of his small size.It couldn\u2019t be helped, though.Since the decision was already made, he had no choice but to obey.Kanbar went up the mountain, feeling embarrassed at being protected by a boy smaller than him.What he witnessed as soon as he entered the mountain was the children\u2019s blades wiping out the monsters.Despite his belief that it was going to be a difficult battle, the orcs, goblins, and kobolds were being annihilated, unable to do anything.\u2018That\u2019s crazy!\u2019He unconsciously gasped.An orc that five grown men together could barely fight against was getting beheaded like a twig. Every single one of the trainees was literally a monster.\u2018So, this was the reason.\u2019He could finally understand why the village chief was paying his utmost respect to those young children. They were completely different people from commoners like him.When he could finally relax after regaining his composure, two orcs came running at him from the left side. His legs wouldn\u2019t move from the stench of their breath.\u201cUaaaah!\u201dWhen he collapsed on the ground with his head going blank, the boy who\u2019d been silent so far stepped up.He drew his sword and swung.It was a simple movement, as if he was cutting already dead meat, and the two approaching orcs\u2019 heads fell off.\u201cHie\u2026\u201dKanbar\u2019s teeth chattered, with his eyes wide.\u2018What was that?\u2019The simple and light swordsmanship made him forget about the other children\u2019s great display of power. He didn\u2019t look like a child\u2014he looked like an old general that had gone through hundreds of battlefields.Despite knowing nothing about swordsmanship, he could clearly see that the boy was special among them.After that, the blond, red-eyed boy next to him observed the surroundings without standing out as they climbed the mountain.He wasn\u2019t doing anything special, but he was preventing any danger from occurring while observing the whole situation.\u2018This boy is the real one\u2026\u2019It was something one could only tell by looking up close. The best among the children, numbering over forty, was the boy that looked the youngest.\u201cWas your name Kanbar?\u201dAs he was observing him with admiration, the blond boy spoke to him.\u201cAh, yes! That\u2019s right! Sir Swordsman!\u201dHe unconsciously addressed him with utmost respect.\u201cAre there any legends about this mountain?\u201d\u201cL-legend?\u201d\u201cYes, something like a great treasure\u2019s existence, or some exceptional monster residing here.\u201d\u201cAh, th-there\u2019s one actually, although it was supposed to be a few hundred years ago. There\u2019s a story of a goblin king coming from the west, fighting the knight's order in this mountain\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm, is there anything like a treasure?\u201d\u201cThere was a story about the goblin king\u2019s ring that wasn\u2019t found afterwards\u2026\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes shone in red for an instant.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dThe moment he heard the boy murmuring to himself silently, chills ran down his spine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He also cut the next goblin that was trying to attack him in half.\u201cTh-thank you.\u201dHe nodded at Kanbar\u2019s thanks and spread his perception more precisely.\u2018He is in the east now.\u2019The gaze observing all the trainees could now be felt from the east. It seemed he had moved from west to east.\u2018I finally remembered where I felt that gaze before.\u2019Raon kept his mouth shut tight as he shook off the blood from his sword.\u2018It was from Eden.\u2019Eden was one of the Five Demons commonly referred to as the continent\u2019s darkness, and they were a group full of lunatics that were arguably the craziest among all kinds of organizations that existed in the world.Their goal was restoration.They believed the era of despair, where the humans used to be hunted by monsters and discriminated against by the other races was the Eden. And they wanted to revive the monsters\u2019 god to return to that age.Eden was literally a group of lunatics. Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t just crazy. They also possessed a strong power, keeping up with Zieghart.They could control monsters like tamers or use the monster\u2019s ability with a human's body.Even the continent\u2019s prestigious Houses didn\u2019t know how they could use such strange power.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Raon knew Eden\u2019s secret.\u2018Thanks to Derus Robert.\u2019He clashed against Eden because of a magic stone retrieval mission he gave to him, and ten groups of shadows, ninety people total, were completely annihilated. He was the only survivor from that hell.\u2018But how did that bastard even learn about it?\u2019When he thought about it, Derus already knew from the beginning that Eden used magic stones.Raon couldn\u2019t understand how he learned that fact and didn\u2019t disclose it, despite being one of the Six Kings.Hey, what are you thinking about right now? I can feel a deep and intense wrath.Wrath burst up from the bracelet, along with a strong chill.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon frowned. He wasn\u2019t sure whether him boiling in anger as soon as he thought about Derus Robert was a good thing or not.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe sighed to subside his anger and sensed the gaze that was still fixated on them.\u2018He\u2019s probably looking for the goblin king\u2019s magic stone.\u2019According to Kanbar\u2019s story, a magic stone must\u2019ve formed as time passed after the goblin king\u2019s death.There were different kinds of magic stones, but the Eden bastards only looked for magic stones from monsters powerful enough to be renowned.\u2018I now understand why the monsters are absentminded.\u2019Eden was letting them kill the monsters so that the trainees, including him, would return quickly after completing the mission.\u2018They have no intention of attacking us.\u2019It seemed Eden wasn\u2019t planning to show themselves, either in order to avoid Zieghart\u2019s attention or in preparation for the instructors or swordsmen that might have followed them.\u2018It must be an important item since they\u2019re going this far.\u2019The goblin king\u2019s magic stone must\u2019ve been an extremely important item for Eden.\u2018Anyway, for now\u2026\u2019Raon furrowed his brows while beheading the orc that was approaching him.\u2018I have no choice but to return without dealing with them.\u2019The moment he touched the magic stone that must exist in the mountain, every Eden member in the surrounding area was going to attack them at once, like a swarm of bees.He might be able to survive, but the trainees and the villagers would certainly die. Therefore, it was best to avoid doing anything stupid\u2014like poking a beehive.The best course of action was to just kill the monsters and return, pretending he didn\u2019t notice anything.\u201cThe monsters are running away! Chase them until the end!\u201dHe raised his head, hearing Burren\u2019s energetic voice.\u201cLet\u2019s go. It will be over soon.\u201dRaon gave Kanbar, who had regained his composure, a fake smile. His tongue felt slightly bitter, as if he had chewed on a tree\u2019s root.***The monster extermination had started in the daybreak and continued smoothly. They managed to reach the top of the mountain before the sun set.\u201cKieee!\u201dHearing the orc shaman\u2019s scream from where it was standing at the top of the mountain, the orcs, kobolds, and goblins came running at them. They looked like a swarm of green bees.\u201cThis is the last!\u201dBurren pierced the sky, taking up his blood-covered sword.\u201cA rat can bite a cat if it is driven into a corner. Don\u2019t be careless until the end!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dBurren rushed out, surrounding himself with green aura, and the trainees kicked the ground with a war cry.\u201cHaa!\u201dRaon also ran ahead, leaving Kanbar behind, in order to slice the monsters. He moved in a way similar to the other trainees, lowering his sword skills.\u2018Keep watching.\u2019He had recognized the owner of the gaze. He was an Eden\u2019s scout called \u2018Red Eye Demon\u2019. He possessed the scouting ability of the monster \u2018Search Eye\u2019, which was just a small floating eye that was the size of a sparrow.\u201cWe are almost there!\u201dBurren shouted while cutting through the orc shaman\u2019s flame. The moment he rushed to the orc shaman, a gigantic sword fell from the sky.Crash!Along with a thunderous noise that shook the mountain, dust spread out at the same time.Whoosh.Once the dust faded, Martha\u2014who was sticking the deflated orc shaman to the ground with her sword\u2014could be seen.\u201cIt\u2019s mine, okay?\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dBurren frowned, but quickly realized the situation and turned around.\u201cThe orc shaman is dead! The rest are small fries, so wipe them out completely!\u201cWaaaa!\u201dWith the anticipation of successfully completing their first battle, they swung their swords using all the remaining aura.Slash!After easily killing the orcs around him, Raon returned to Kanbar. He called him after creating an energy barrier, so that nobody could hear him.\u201cI have a question about the story with the goblin king earlier.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dKanbar bowed and answered.\u201cHas a gem or a treasure ever been found in the mountain since the goblin king died?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dKanbar took his time, without responding immediately.\u201cIt has.\u201d\u201cYes, indeed. I shouldn\u2019t lie to my benefactor. The village chief brought a red gem from the mountain when I was little.\u201d\u201cWhere is it now?\u201d\u201cThe village chief buried it under his house as far as I know, and the village grew warm afterwards. I think most people don\u2019t know about this fact.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dRaon bit his lip.\u2018This is a completely different story now\u2026\u2019If Eden couldn\u2019t find the gem after searching in the mountain, they were definitely going to attack Cebu village next, since those lunatics didn\u2019t have much patience.\u201cWe\u2019ve won!\u201d\u201cFirst mission, success!\u201d\u201cWaaaa!\u201dShouts of victory came from the trainees, who managed to occupy the top of the mountain after annihilating the monsters.\u201cHmph!\u201dBurren looked at Raon as he held his sword. His expression was telling him he\u2019d accomplished the mission Raon gave to him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout responding to Burren\u2019s gaze, Raon furrowed his brows. He had too many things to think about.\u201cYeaaah!\u201dBurren shouted louder than anyone. It looked like he thought Raon had acknowledged him through that attitude.Runaan also seemed happy about the victory as she nodded slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s so loud.\u201dMartha looked at Raon, picking her ears as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal.After watching the trainees that were shouting, Raon looked down at Cebu village. His frustration only grew stronger upon seeing the smoke rising from the roofs of various colors.\u2018If they ever learn about the fact that the magic stone isn\u2019t in the mountain, but in the village\u2026\u2019Only thing left in that village would be the smoke.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A festival was held as soon as they returned to the village.The villagers were full of smiles, as they didn\u2019t need to worry about the monsters for a while now.\u201cThank you for your hard work!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dThe village chief and the villagers bowed to every single one of the trainees and thanked them.\u201cIt was our job.\u201dBurren shook his hand, smiling in happiness. His expression was as bright as a magic lamp, as he had perfectly completed the mission without a single casualty.\u201cThank you for working hard for our village.\u201dThe village chief also bowed to Raon, who was standing at the back.\u201cThis guy told me Sir Swordsman was really outstanding. Thank you for protecting us.\u201d\u201cI honestly thought he wasn\u2019t very trustworthy at first, but he really is excellent with his sword.\u201dThe village chief smiled, pointing at Kanbar, and Kanbar also smiled.\u201cNo problem.\u201dRaon smiled plainly. The village chief and Kanbar thanked him once again and went to the other trainees to thank them.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe felt uncomfortable after seeing their eyes. He wanted to tell them about it, but the entire village was currently under observation. The slightest mistake could get everyone killed.\u201cAren\u2019t you feeling well?\u201dRunaan tilted her head, sitting next to him.\u201cDo you wanna eat ice cream?\u201dShe tried taking out the rectangular box from her chest.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dRaon shook his head with a smile.\u201cOkay.\u201dRunaan put the box back in its place with a regretful expression. It seemed she wanted to eat the ice cream together to rejoice.Her cute thoughts made him smile.What are you doing! Why are you missing the opportunity to eat the ice cream?!\u2018That\u2019s not the important thing right now.\u2019Nothing\u2019s more important than the ice cream! Call the girl back right now!\u2018Haaa.\u2019Raon forced Wrath back into the bracelet, who was angrier than when he laughed at him.\u201cSo.\u201dHe raised his head at the voice heard from the top of the tree. Martha was looking at him, holding an apple.\u201cDid it go as you wanted? I\u2019m still not sure what you wanted, though.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure either.\u201dRaon shook his head. He had nothing to say for now, nor could he say anything.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No matter what happens, I\u2019ll follow your command until the end of the mission.\u201dMartha went down after meeting his eyes.\u201cGet away!\u201dShe sat at the center of the table where the food was being brought out. She seemed to be her usual self.\u201cLet\u2019s go, too.\u201dRaon stood up and signaled Runaan with his chin.\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan nodded and walked up to the table.All kinds of tasty-looking foods were displayed. There were so many that he felt like the villagers must\u2019ve strained themselves.\u201cThere is still plenty of food left for you. Please eat to your heart\u2019s content!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cPlease enjoy!\u201dAccepting the village chief and the villagers\u2019 cheers, the trainees raised their hands and started to eat like a storm.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon sighed softly. He felt uncomfortable about the food and the people\u2019s smiles alike.\u2018Tomorrow is going to be an important day.\u2019***The next morning.Burren left Cebu village, leading the trainees. The villagers kept following them for over twenty minutes and waved their hands.\u2018I think everything ended well.\u2019Burren smiled, walking up the hill where they could see the village underneath.\u2018It was perfect.\u2019They managed to perfectly wipe out the monsters in Cebu Mountain without any fatalities or injuries. All they had suffered were a few light wounds, so it could be considered perfect for his first time.He took a glance in the back.Raon was walking while looking down, with a thoughtful expression on his face. Without asking him to return the command, he kept following silently.\u2018But of course.\u2019There was no flaw in his command. It was a perfect strategy except for Martha killing the orc shaman in the end.\u2018I don\u2019t know what he wanted to see, but he must be satisfied.\u2019Raon gave him the command, telling him to act like a Zieghart. He couldn\u2019t have any complaints, no matter what he had wanted.\u201cLet\u2019s walk faster!\u201dWith their chests filled with satisfaction, Burren and the trainees walked towards the north, where Zieghart\u2019s domain was located.When the sun started moving down from the middle of the sky after walking for over five hours, Raon Zieghart\u2014who had been silent\u2014stepped forward.\u201cStop, everyone.\u201d\u201cWhy, out of nowhere\u2026?\u201dBurren closed his mouth upon seeing Raon\u2019s eyes. The eyes, burning in red, were suffocating him.\u201cThe real mission starts now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019ve killed all the monsters, and even finished cleaning it up, so why is the mission still not over?\u201d\u201cWhat was our mission?\u201d\u201cHuh? That\u2019s\u2026\u201dBurren frowned, then opened his mouth again.\u201cThe monster extermination and the village\u2019s protection.\u201d\u201cYes. Our mission includes the village\u2019s protection on top of the monster extermination.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019ve already finished it! It\u2019s over since we\u2019ve killed all the monsters!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRaon shook his head, and looked towards Cebu village, where they came from.\u201cWe\u2019ve been under observation until just now. The observing gaze went away about an hour ago.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWh-what do you mean?\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201dThe surprised trainees stood up at once.\u201cI-it must be an instructor.\u201dBurren forced himself to twist the corners of his mouth. It seemed he couldn\u2019t believe there was someone observing them.\u201cIt must be an instructor who came to watch over us\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t tell who it was if it was an instructor\u2019s presence. That presence observed not only us, but also the entire village. Moreover\u2026\u201dRaon pointed at the road they had walked past.\u201cAs soon as we went half a day\u2019s distance away from the village, the presence disappeared. Towards the village, on top of that.\u201d\u201cWhich means\u2026 Is it another enemy?\u201dBurren\u2019s jaw dropped. He looked at the village with trembling eyes.\u201cIs that true?\u201dMartha, who had been silent, stood up with a frown.\u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\u201cWhen did you start feeling that gaze?\u201d\u201cAs soon as we arrived at the hill from where we could see the village.\u201d\u201cWait! Then the reason you gave the command to Burren was\u2026\u201d\u201cCorrect. I hid my presence in order to observe that gaze more clearly.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dMartha gulped.\u2018What the hell is he\u2026?\u2019The hair at the back of her neck stood on end upon hearing Raon\u2019s words.Not only had he felt a gaze and presence that even she couldn\u2019t feel, but he had also been investigating the gaze while hiding in the middle of the trainees by making Burren the top trainee. His perception and the depth of his thoughts were so astonishing that she couldn\u2019t even speak.\u201cW-was that the reason why you gave me the command?\u201d\u201cI thought you would manage the trainees better than me if you took command.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou did perfectly as the top trainee, better than I\u2019d thought. Thanks to that, they will think that you are the top trainee and shouldn\u2019t have felt my presence. You really did great, worthy of Zieghart\u2019s name like you said. I\u2019ll suggest that you\u2019re made vice-top trainee once we return.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dBurren\u2019s lip quivered and he lowered his head.\u2018Damn it!\u2019He was too embarrassed to raise his head.\u2018I thought I did a great job\u2026\u2019He believed Raon was speechless to his perfect performance, yet it wasn\u2019t the case at all. He had been hiding behind in order to hold the observer, the one that no one had noticed, in check.While he was focused on a small thing like the top trainee\u2019s right to command, Raon had been watching something much further and higher up.Crunch.However, it was funny that he didn\u2019t feel bad hearing Raon\u2019s compliment.It was a complicated feeling, a mixture of embarrassment and achievement.\u201cYou probably didn\u2019t know this, but orcs, goblins, and kobolds aren\u2019t capable of cooperating. The ones that have been observing us must\u2019ve done something with them.\u201dWithout mentioning Eden, Raon told them about what he saw and felt.\u201cOur first mission is the village\u2019s protection. Our mission hasn\u2019t ended as we don\u2019t know the intention of that observer.\u201dHe grabbed his bag and stood up.\u201cWe are returning to Cebu village. However, unlike before\u2014when we casually walked in where anyone could notice\u2014we are going to move silently, so that no one will notice us.\u201dHe continued after glancing at everyone.\u201cIt would be great to have something to camouflage ourselves with, but since we didn\u2019t bring anything like that, let\u2019s start with the steps\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I have something.\u201dDorian, who had been out of his mind, raised his hand.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have covers to hide our military outfits with, and bands to attach leaves on our clothes.\u201d\u201cHaving one or two of them won\u2019t be of any use. It will make you stick out inst\u2026\u201d\u201cI have enough.\u201dDorian took out a bunch of covers and bands from his belly pocket. Raon couldn\u2019t understand what the hell was wrong with him, bringing all of that around.\u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d\u201cI brought them just in case.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you brought forty pieces of camouflage equipment\u00a0just in case?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to be well prepared.\u201d\u201cA-anyway, good job.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dDorian smiled happily at getting complimented by Raon for the first time. Then his face grew clouded once again since they were probably going to fight once they returned to the village.\u201cSince we have enough materials, start camouflaging yourselves the way you\u2019ve learned in the training ground. Come back here in ten minutes, and\u2026\u201dRaon raised his head after putting on the cover before anyone else.\u201cKrein.\u201d\u201cHuh? Uuh!\u201d\u201cReturn to the Zieghart branch office immediately and convey to them exactly what I told you.\u201d\u201cM-me?\u201d\u201cYou are the fastest.\u201dEven though Dorian was faster, something might happen where he is needed.\u201cA-alright!\u201dProbably because he was happy about being acknowledged, Krein nodded immediately and started running in the opposite direction of the village.Raon watched him run for a moment, then turned his head.\u201cFrom now on, you must obey my orders no matter what. Refusal isn\u2019t an option.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cEveryone left.\u201dThe man wearing a mask with an eyeball drowning on it knelt down.\u201cAre you sure?\u201dThe young man holding a green helmet turned his head.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve confirmed their exit as they celebrated their victory for half a day. I\u2019ve also checked the other side just in case, but there were no notable problems.\u201d\u201cThen we can start now.\u201dThe young man snickered, then equipped the patternless helmet.\u201cRestoration.\u201dHe spoke as if he were chanting, then green rusty water flowed down under the helmet.Fizzle!Enormous muscles expanded from his arms and chest, his fingers growing as hard as steel and his legs growing as thick as tree roots.What he was wearing wasn\u2019t normal knight armor.It was the grotesque armor of an orc, and not just any orc\u2014a fighter orc that stood on the frontlines of the orc raiders.Sparkle!Red eyes, full of murderous intent, shone from the orc fighter\u2019s helmet.\u201cKrrrrrr!\u201dA grotesque roar burst from his throat. It wasn\u2019t a human\u2019s voice, but a sound made by a monster.\u201cWoooo!\u201dThe orcs came running out from behind him, as if they were answering the roar.The man pointed towards Cebu village with a hand surrounded by a threatening red energy.\u201cKrrrrrr!\u201d\u201cKieeee!\u201dThe orcs ran down the mountain, all while screaming in hostility. Their movements were incomparably fiercer than when the trainees were killing them.\u201cKrrr.\u201dThe man wearing the orc fighter armor smiled savagely and watched the monsters rushing to the village like a tidal wave.***Raon and the trainees arrived at the hill, where they could see the whole village underneath.\u201cNothing happened yet, though.\u201dBurren frowned upon seeing the village. There was nothing but smoke, showing how peaceful it was.\u201cJust wait. And lower your voice and body.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHearing Raon\u2019s command, Burren closed his mouth and leaned forward.\u201cYou must be extremely careful from now on, including your breathing. We might be annihilated the moment we get found out.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cHup!\u201dThe trainees covered their mouths with their trembling hands.\u201cYou are exaggerating\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens, right? Since we are Ziegharts\u2026\u201dHowever, a few collaterals that didn\u2019t believe Raon complained. They were full of confidence, carried away by their first victory.\u201cSilence. You can complain once everything becomes clear.\u201dThe collaterals only shut their mouths and sat down after Burren told them to.\u201cFill your stomach in advance with jerky, then put on your winter clothes. We won\u2019t be able to start a fire even if it gets cold at night.\u201dThe trainees followed Raon\u2019s command, albeit complaining slightly.As such, the sun set on Cebu Mountain, and the dark night came.Under the pitch-dark mountain, hundreds of red lights shone. Green monsters poured out alongside with the ruby colored lights.\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cO-orcs! They are monsters!\u201d\u201cIt was true?\u201dThe trainees gulped, seeing the orcs\u2019 brutal eyes.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren bit his dry lip. They had thoroughly investigated Cebu Mountain and the surrounding area, and no monsters had been found. It didn\u2019t make any sense that so many monsters had appeared in such a short time.\u2018He was right.\u2019Just like Raon had said, monsters that were even more powerful and ferocious than the ones they had exterminated were rushing towards the village.Ding Ding Ding!The villager standing watch on the wooden fence rang the bell. The village that was buried in darkness lit up and grew noisy.\u201cDamn it!\u201dBurren stood up, grit his teeth. He breathed out roughly while drawing his sword.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s put an end to it this time for sure\u2026\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dRaon gestured with his chin with a frightening gaze.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI told you already. There was a gaze observing us. That wasn\u2019t something like a monster, but a human. Their identity wasn\u2019t revealed yet.\u201d\u201cB-but Cebu village\u2019s forces can\u2019t defend against that many orcs!\u201d\u201cEven then, we are going to stand by. We are going to be the ones annihilated at a single mistake.\u201dIt was an accurate decision without being swayed by the emotions. They shouldn\u2019t make their move until they could properly identify the enemy's numbers and power.\u201cYou said that already! Our mission is the village\u2019s protection! We have to move immediately!\u201d\u201cThe instructor also mentioned that giving up or withdrawing are also a viable choice in the mission. Now isn\u2019t the right time to move.\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t stand watching it.\u201dBurren\u2019s hand holding the sword trembled.\u201cLetting them die like that isn\u2019t something a Zieghart swordsman would do!\u201dThe orcs\u2019 charge was reflected in his green eyes.\u201cYou are right.\u201d\u201cWe are Ziegharts. We can\u2019t withdraw after seeing the weak in a predicament.\u201d\u201cEven if they are Eden?\u201dRaon\u2019s composed voice cut into the trainees\u2019 words full of passion.\u201cE-Eden? Eden from the Five Demons?\u201d\u201cAre you saying they are those lunatics?\u201d\u201cEden is famous for controlling monsters. There\u2019s no way that many monsters would suddenly appear unless Eden is involved.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-why the Five Demons\u2026\u201dThe trainees\u2019 eyes blurred as if they were being eroded upon hearing that their enemy was Eden of the Five Demons. Everyone knew just how powerful and frightening an organization Eden was.\u201cI know about Eden\u2019s power. They didn\u2019t attack us back then, which means they are afraid of Zieghart\u2019s name.\u201dBurren clenched his fist so tightly that it could bleed.\u201cI can\u2019t show my back and run away from such people. I believe drawing my sword here for them is what a Zieghart swordsman should do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to not help them whatsoever. We need to first understand the situation, then decide if we can fight\u2026\u201d\u201cThat would be too late. Half of the villagers would be dead by then.\u201dHe looked at Raon with trembling eyes.\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve acknowledged you. After watching your efforts, I acknowledged you in my heart as the one more befitting to the Zieghart name than me! But this is wrong! I\u2019m going to help the village, even if that means I have to fight you when you try to stop me.\u201dBurren drew his sword. His well-polished sword reflected his resolute face under the moonlight.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to follow me. Follow me if you agree with me!\u201dHe ran down the hill, surrounded by a green aura and unbreakable will.\u201cWe shall go as well. Let\u2019s show the Five Demons how powerful Zieghart's sword is!\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dWhen Raon clicked his tongue, somebody stood up next to him.\u201cI\u2019m going to go too.\u201dRunaan ran down the hill, surrounded by a blue frost.\u201cWe will follow you!\u201dThe trainees from vassal families drew their swords and stuck next to her.\u201cL-let\u2019s go as well!\u201d\u201cYou are right. We are also Zieghart\u2019s trainees!\u201dThe commoner trainees that were affected by Burren and Runaan\u2019s conviction also drew their swords and ran towards the village\u2019s light.More than half of them had left, but Raon wasn\u2019t flustered.\u2018Because I knew this would happen.\u2019He already knew the trainees were those kinds of people. Having them run down to help them was also a part of his plan.He had even used aura to specifically send Runaan a message to go down to help Burren.However, the most unexpected person was staying.\u201cWhy are you not going?\u201dRaon turned around to look at Martha, who was leaning back against a tree.\u201cI told you already. I\u2019ll follow your instructions on this mission, regardless of what they are.\u201dRaon could see the sincerity in her shining black eyes. It seemed she had her own conviction.\u201cI see.\u201dRaon snickered.\u201cThen what are you going to do now? Are you just going to spectate them from here?\u201d\u201cNo, we are going to move as well.\u201dRaon shook his head and stood up. The orcs had already reached the wooden fence.It looked like a red mist was shimmering from the people\u2019s fear and the orcs\u2019 madness.\u201cBut instead of moving openly like them, we are going to hide our presence. Warm yourself up so you can move whenever it is necessary.\u201dAfter giving out his instructions, he glared halfway up Cebu Mountain instead of at Cebu village. A powerful and thick murderous intent was wavering over there.\u2018He must be there.\u2019He could stop the trainees, but the reason he let them do as they pleased was simple.Because he managed to identify the man over there.A monster that had borrowed an orc fighter\u2019s strength and combative spirit was looking down on the village from midway up the mountain.It would be difficult to win against him if he fought him head on, but assassination was a different story.\u2018I\u2019m more than capable of killing him as long as they keep his attention.\u2019Raon turned his wrist, shining his red eyes as the moon floated in the sky.\u2018This is going to be a long night.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was looking at Burren and Runaan, who were running down to Cebu village.\u201cTh-they are Zieghart trainees.\u201dThe Red Eye Demon, who was wearing a mask with an eye drawn on it, knelt and answered.\u201cI\u2019m sure you said that those brats had returned.\u201dMurderous intent could be felt from his voice. It was completely different from his usual calm and composed voice.\u201cI-I\u2019m sure they left. I came back after confirming that fact\u2026\u201d\u201cThat means somebody among them had realized you were tailing them.

The man breathed out roughly while watching them.\u201cP-probably not. There was a black-haired girl who was better than them.\u201d\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cJudging from the way she can\u2019t be found anywhere, she must be hiding somewhere and watching.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe man wearing the orc fighter armor crossed his arms and looked down on the village.\u201cThey fight well.\u201dThe Zieghart trainees drew a line, as if they made a formation, and were killing all the orcs that went over the wooden fence.\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be enough to break through.\u201dLooking back at the masked man, he gestured with his chin.\u201cSend the green demons.\u201d\u201cPardon? Didn\u2019t you say that you wouldn\u2019t meddle with Ziegharts\u2026?\u201d\u201cDo you think they came back here without doing anything after noticing you? They must\u2019ve sent a reinforcement request to the branch office, and it\u2019s too late to stop it.

A smile appeared on his mouth that could be seen slightly.\u201cTo have returned despite having been spared, your luck must\u2019ve ended after being chosen by the Ziegharts.\u201d***Slash!Burren cut the orc running towards him in half, then jumped over the half-destroyed wooden fence.\u201cStand in front of the wooden fence! People will be in danger if the orcs come over the fence!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe collateral trainees answered loud and clear, creating a formation in front of the wooden fence.Whir!Burren turned his head, noticing the frost spreading from his left side.It was Runaan. The frost on her sword also covered the ground, hindering the orcs\u2019 movements.Clank!The frost spread into the air, shedding blood, and the orcs collapsed\u2014unable to do anything.\u2018That\u2019s unexpected.\u2019Runaan always stuck next to Raon, so the fact that she had come with him without following his opinion was unexpected.\u2018But I\u2019m glad.\u2019The orcs\u2019 numbers were one thing, but their ferocity was on a different level than the ones they had faced the day before.If Runaan and the trainees from the vassal families weren\u2019t there, the wooden fence would\u2019ve been completely broken by then, resulting in many casualties in the village.\u201cDon\u2019t take the orcs\u2019 attacks head on! Deflect them, then counterattack!\u201dWhile giving out appropriate instructions, Burren kept slashing the orcs. Since he had already done it before, it wasn\u2019t too difficult to command the troops according to the situation.\u2018We should be able to stop them at this rate.\u2019Even though the orcs were stronger, the trainees were more than enough to defend against them since they had the experience of fighting them.\u2018However\u2026\u2019If they were really Eden like Raon had said, that wasn\u2019t going to be the end of it. For sure\u2026Rustle.While Burren was thinking about the future, the forest in front of the village started to move.\u2018No, it\u2019s not the forest.\u2019Mysterious men hiding their entire bodies with green hooded robes popped up from the forest. They numbered over forty at a rough count.\u201cGreen demons!\u201dBurren screamed, gripping his sword tightly.\u2018Damn it! They were really Eden.\u2019The green demons were Eden\u2019s lesser warriors, and they possessed the characteristics of orcs, goblins, and kobolds.\u201cRunaan!\u201dWhile raising his aura to the extreme, he called for Runaan.\u201cWe are going to fight in front. Support us from behind!\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan immediately responded, spreading an even thicker frost towards the approaching green demons.Smack! Smaack!The orcs drew the axes from off their backs and around their waists, swinging them towards the trainees.\u201cDeflect the blows!\u201dBurren deflected the axe with his sword and cut off the green demon\u2019s head.Splash!The sensation of cutting through human flesh gave him goosebumps, but he endured it by biting his lip.\u201cDon\u2019t consider them human! Cut their heads off in a single strike!\u201dEven in his flustered state, Burren was properly using the Zieghart swordsmanship. He advanced while sending out sharp strikes.\u201cHaa!\u201dRunaan spread the frost from her sword towards Burren and the trainees that were advancing.Whir!The frost went past them, dropping down on the green demon\u2019s heads.Crack!The green demons\u2019 clothes and skin were frozen and their movements slowed.\u201cDo it now! Charge!\u201dBurren wasn\u2019t just commanding them. He was the first one to charge onto the green demons, starting to kill them.\u201cWe can win!\u201dHis chest stung despite saying that. There were still many green demons left, and the trainees were getting tired.Moreover\u2026Swoosh!The green demons who had goblins and kobold\u2019s characteristics didn\u2019t approach them. Instead, they started firing poison needles, or spreading poison mists.\u201cCover your mouths!\u201dBurren took his clothes to cover his nose and mouth, then parried the poison needles fired at him.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cKeuh!\u201d\u201cD-damn it!\u201dSince there were too many green demons firing the poison needles and there were multiple green demons approaching them, the trainees started to step back one by one.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dBurren breathed out roughly. His head felt dizzy from parrying the poison needles and fighting while holding his breath.\u201cHaa!\u201dHe glanced around, hearing Runaan\u2019s shout. She was overpowering the green demon with intense frost, but the fact that she had come to the front line meant that the situation was already at its worst.\u201cKieee!\u201dThe green demons were cunning. The moment Runaan\u2019s frost spread, they stepped back and started throwing poison needles and poison smoke.\u201cHuff!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dUpon inhaling the poison smoke, the trainees\u2019 limbs started wobbling.\u201cH-hold on! We still\u2026\u201dHe felt like the command he had just given was in vain. The strength left his arms and his legs trembled.\u2018A-at this rate\u2026\u2019They couldn\u2019t last for long. As the word annihilation kept coming back to his mind, a powerful energy burst up from the left side.Bang!* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A yellow aura crushed against them like a tornado to defeat all the green demons, and Martha Zieghart was standing there alone.\u201cKill them all!\u201dFollowing Martha\u2019s command, the trainees that remained next to Raon rushed onto the battlefield.\u201cN-now is the time! Kill them all!\u201dBurren grit his teeth and brandished his sword. The trainees, including him, had inhaled poison smoke. However, he couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity.\u201cGo for it!\u201dAt Martha\u2019s aura-filled strike, the green demons\u2019 axes and swords were shattered.\u2018It's perfect timing.\u2019Thanks to her well-timed surprise attack, the green demons were getting wiped out, unable to find an opening to attack back.\u2018We did it!\u2019Raon was still nowhere to be seen, but it looked like they could win.\u201cDon\u2019t let a single one escape!\u201dBurren grit his teeth and rushed towards the green demons.\u201cUntil the end\u2026 huh?\u201dHe was going to swing his sword and follow them to Cebu Mountain, but he stood still, ducking his head.\u201cWh-what is it\u2026\u201dSomething was moving inside the red cloud and fog that seemed to cover the entire forest.He could hear somebody gulping from behind.Step.A mysterious man wearing puffed up green armor made his appearance.He was wearing an orc fighter helmet with a cross shaped scar on the forehead and a bucktooth rolling up to the tip of his nose.Burren\u2019s hand holding the sword trembled.\u201cTh-that orc fighter armor! Green War Demon!\u201dGreen War Demon was one of Eden's lower executives, and he was a monster that had the orc fighter\u2019s strength transferred to his human body.\u201cR-retreat!\u201dBurren stepped back, his trembling hand holding his sword. His limbs trembled as he faced that frightening presence.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRunaan couldn\u2019t hide her trembling eyes either.\u201cGreen War Demon, huh?\u201dOn the other hand, Martha licked her lips. Her eyes looked like she was going to attack him right away, but she was also aware that she couldn\u2019t win on her own.\u201cYou are making it annoying.\u201dThe Green War Demon\u2019s mouth opened. What came out was a growl full of murderous intent, as if he had really become an orc fighter.\u201cI gave you the chance to return after playing around a little, yet you threw it away. That was completely stupid.\u201dHe grabbed the double-edged axes on his back. An overwhelming wave of energy rampaged through the trainees, taking their breath away.The red energy burning on the axe was the combative energy that only mid upper-level monsters could use. And Eden\u2019s executives were all capable of using that combative energy.\u201cKeuh!\u201d\u201cKuh!\u201dThe trainees were barely standing, biting their lips.\u2018We would\u2019ve already collapsed if we didn\u2019t have that training.\u2019Burren\u2019s fingernail scratched his hand. If Rimmer hadn\u2019t trained them to withstand his pressure, he would\u2019ve been kneeling and waiting for his death.\u201cSo, you withstood my pressure despite being a mere trainee. You are indeed a Zieghart.\u201dThe Green War Demon grinned.\u201cBut you are stupid. You are going to die because you\u2019ve acted rashly, without even knowing your own abilities.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s warning resounded in Burren\u2019s head.\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we try, you disgusting bastard!\u201dMartha stepped up while provoking him. She bent her hand backward to signal Runaan and Burren.Seeing her hand signaling them to attack him at once in three seconds, their eyes glowed intensely.\u201cWhatever you do is pointless.\u201d\u201cShut up! Your breath stinks!\u201dMartha dashed at the center while Burren and Runaan penetrated from both sides.\u201cDo you think you can do it together, just the three of you?\u201dThe Green War Demon swung his axe horizontally. A heavy combative energy engulfed the space, following an intense wind pressure.\u201cKuaaah!\u201d\u201cKya!\u201d\u201cKuh!\u201dBurren\u2019s sword was broken, Runaan bounced back, and Martha knelt down. It all happened in a single strike. The Green War Demon was on a completely different level from the three of them.\u201cAah\u2026\u201d\u201cE-even those three can\u2019t match up to them\u2026\u201d\u201cThen how\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about Raon? Where is he?!\u201d\u201cH-He must\u2019ve run away. Why would he be here after watching that?!\u201dDespair filled the trainees\u2019 eyes. The three of them could defeat all the trainees combined, yet they had crumbled in a single strike. They couldn\u2019t figure out a way to win.However, they couldn\u2019t run away either. Forget running away, they couldn\u2019t even breathe properly because of the Green War Demon\u2019s murderous intent.\u201cDid you think we let you go because you were so strong?\u201dThe Green War Demon walked towards them with an even more powerful murderous intent.\u201cYou are just larvae riding on a huge tree named Zieghart. You don\u2019t have any ability, might, or willpower. Did you think you were some sort of big deal?\u201dEvery single one of his steps ignited a flame of combative energy from the ground.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dBurren grabbed his broken sword tightly and Runaan raised her body with trembling arms.\u201cD-damn it!\u201dMartha\u2019s fighting spirit hadn\u2019t faded away yet. She grit her teeth and raised her aura.\u201cYou are the best among this pile of trash.\u201dThe Green War Demon walked towards Martha, who was standing at the front.\u201cI guess, since you managed to notice that gaze.\u201dHe growled and stood in front of Martha.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dUnable to shake off the orc fighter armor pressure, Martha bit her lip and her body trembled.\u201cSince it came to this, I\u2019d better trample on all the Zieghart\u2019s sprouts.\u201dThe Green War Demon raised his double-edged axe, his smile full of murderous intent.\u201cThen die.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes widened. The moment the Green War Demon was about to swing his axe, a pitch-black shadow appeared behind him.Raon Zieghart.The boy that had never shown himself so far swung his sword.\u201cNo. You die.\u201dSurrounded by a crimson flame, Raon\u2019s sword dashed towards the Green War Demon\u2019s neck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looked like victory was near, but it was also the most dangerous moment.\u2018The Green War Demon hasn\u2019t made his appearance yet.\u2019Eden\u2019s Green War Demon, who had ordered the green demons to attack, must've been up there.Raon approached the bushes where everyone was fighting very slowly and silently.The moment Burren, Runaan, and Martha were about to swing their swords at the remaining few green demons\u2026He appeared.\u2018The Green War Demon, I knew you were there.\u2019Eden\u2019s lower executive, the Green War Demon, who had received orc fighter\u2019s strength. He was walking towards them with tremendous pressure.Slam!Burren, Runaan, and Martha were bounced back at once with a single enraged strike. Oppressed by the Green War Demon\u2019s pressure, they couldn\u2019t even move their bodies properly.Thump.Raon moved his feet, synchronizing his heartbeat with the Green War Demon\u2019s breath.The movement of his feet was the Shadowless Steps he had learned, his life on the line, when he used to be an assassin. Moving as secretly as a shadow, he moved to the Green War Demon\u2019s back.Whoosh!As the Green War Demon was about to swing his ax at Martha, he raised his sword while hiding his murderous intent under the Green War Demon\u2019s murderous intent.\u201cThen die!\u201dThe moment the Green War Demon was about to strike, he used the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Whir!The first flame of \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019. The flower of flame that ignited at the end of the sword fell towards the Green War Demon\u2019s neck.\u201cYou!\u201dThe Green War Demon\u2019s eyes were full of astonishment as he turned around. He used his combative energy on his back in that instant, trying to deflect the sword\u2019s trajectory.\u201cJust die without struggling.\u201dRaon split apart the Green War Demon\u2019s combative energy with the flame from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 and slammed his sword down.\u201cKuaaaah!\u201dThe moment the sword that fell like a lightning was about to slice his neck, he pierced into him instead.Thud!With red blood gushing out, something fell to the ground.Raon frowned and glared in front of him.\u201cKuhuhu\u2026\u201dThe Green War Demon, whose left arm was completely cut off, was smiling as he coughed up blood.\u201cIt looks like you didn\u2019t expect me to move into you.\u201d\u201cCrazy bastard.\u201dHuman instinct was to run away from danger, not to run towards it. Moving towards him in that instant to sacrifice his arm instead of his neck was a really crazy thing to do.\u2018This is why I didn\u2019t want to fight them.\u2019Raon clicked his tongue.\u201cKuh!\u201dRed combative energy burst from the Green War Demon\u2019s shoulder, and the blood that was gushing out like a broken dam stopped.\u201cIt looks like you can\u2019t move either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon didn\u2019t respond. Just as he said, he couldn\u2019t move for a moment since he had wagered a lot on that single strike.He would\u2019ve run towards him to behead him already if he could move his body.\u201cAre you the person in charge here?\u201dHe opened his mouth while recovering his body and aura by swinging his \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u201cWhat else? Do you think somebody higher up than me would come to such a small village?\u201dThe Green War Demon grasped his axe with the remaining arm tightly. The red combative energy, which had subsided, burst out once again.\u201cWell, we never know. After all, you guys are lunatics.\u201dReleasing the murky energy with his breath, Raon bent his knee slightly. He filled his lungs with fresh air in a posture where he could start dashing whenever he wanted.Thud!The Green War Demon kicked the ground. He swung his axe, exuding a tremendous amount of murderous intent\u2014enough to give him goosebumps.Whir!Raon swung his sword upward. The cleansed first flame of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 surrounded his sword,Clang!The sword and double-edged axe clashed, sounding like steel being crushed.Whir!The crimson spark spread out, burning the ground.\u201cDid you just block that?\u201dThe Green War Demon swung his axe horizontally while glaring at him. The powerful wind pressure made it difficult to move his sword properly.\u201cI should give up on being a swordsman if I can\u2019t even block that.\u201dRaon swung his sword, engulfed in fire.Clash!His hand felt like it was being torn apart as they clashed for the second time, but he brandished his sword once again, hiding his expression.\u201cYou understand the warrior\u2019s spirit! A brat from Zieghart!\u201dThe Green War Demon burst into grotesque laughter and swung his axe.\u201cEven so, I can\u2019t spare your life!\u201d\u201cI never asked you to spare my life.\u201dRaon swung his sword to block the axe and advanced one step.Clang!Facing the tremendous amount of combative energy imbued in the axe, Raon\u2019s sword trembled as if it was going to break.\u2018I have to withstand it.\u2019He couldn\u2019t break through him with his current power. He needed to fight while deflecting the axe\u2019s energy.Slam!Using the intricacy of Zieghart\u2019s swordsmanship, he blocked the Green War Demon\u2019s instinctive attacks.Raon and the monster with an orc\u2019s instinct clashed their sword and axe countless times at close quarters.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cWh-what is this?\u201dBurren\u2019s chin trembled, his eyes wide.\u2018Seriously, what is this\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t breathe because of the two monsters fighting in front of him, clashing their sword and axe.\u2018H-how many times have they swung their weapons?\u2019He couldn\u2019t even recognize the trajectory of the sword and axe. It would\u2019ve been an understatement to say they were better than himself, since they were on a completely different level.Whoosh!The Green War Demon\u2019s axe pummeled down like lightning.He unconsciously swallowed.If that attack was directed on his head, his body would\u2019ve been split into two right after. Goosebumps appeared on his arm thinking about it.However, Raon parried the ax by swinging his sword in a semi-circular trajectory.Slam!The axe crushed the ground. Red energy burst out from the cracked ground.\u201cTh-that\u2026\u201dBurren scratched the ground with his hand.\u2018It\u2019s the \u2018Star-Connecting Sword\u2019!\u2019The \u2018Star-Connecting Sword was the most basic technique learned before anything else in Zieghart. Raon was stopping that mighty axe using the \u2018Star-Connecting Sword\u2019 alone.Burren couldn\u2019t close his mouth. Saying that he was surprised was an understatement at that point.\u2018I thought I had somewhat caught up to him\u2026\u2019He\u2019d been nurturing his body and mind with everything he had after being impressed by Raon\u2019s efforts. He had thought he was right behind him now, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all.The strike that cut off the Green War Demon\u2019s arm earlier and the might Raon was displaying right now far surpassed a trainee\u2019s level.\u201cDo you get it?\u201dHe turned his head around at the voice that sounded like a lamentation. Martha was right next to him, gasping for breath.\u201cThat\u2019s his true power.\u201dMartha narrowed her eyes and glared at Raon, who was fighting equally against the Green War Demon.\u201cWhat he showed us was just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dShe was already aware of the fact that Raon had been hiding his power.\u2018However\u2026\u2019She had never imagined he was strong enough to fight on equal ground against the Green War Demon, who had pushed back herself, Burren, and Runaan with a single strike.\u2018I have no choice but to acknowledge him now.\u2019Martha clenched her fist. The mission. Everything was in Raon\u2019s grasp. The situation developed just as he had said, and it was achieved the way he wanted.The only thing left was defeating that monster.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRunaan, who regained her composure, approached them holding a broken sword. Raon, who seemed to be barely holding on, was reflected on her blue eyes.She bit her lip harshly and was about to participate in the fight. That was when Martha blocked her way.\u201cCalm down. You will get torn into pieces the moment you step in.\u201d\u201cI can help him.\u201d\u201cYou are going to die before then.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dRunaan shook her head. Only thing reflected in her eyes was Raon, who was evading the axe with difficulty.\u2018This girl\u2026\u2019Martha furrowed her brow. Considering she was trying to participate despite knowing the danger, it seemed she wasn\u2019t following Raon for no reason.\u201cThen hold back just a little bit longer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat guy\u2026\u201dMartha pointed at Raon. His eyes, which looked like crimson lightning, were bursting up instead. Martha continued while looking at such eyes.\u201cHe has the same eyes as when he won against me in a duel.\u201d***\u201cKuh!\u201dThe Green War Demon bared his teeth, exuding his combative energy.\u201cIt looks like you are running out of strength, am I right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon didn\u2019t respond. He just focused on swinging his sword and blocking the axe.\u2018The murderous intent is getting more and more intense.\u2019It seemed that he didn\u2019t earn the orc fighter\u2019s armor with hopscotch, since he was still full of energy despite having lost a quarter of his upper body. It was truly a crazy amount of endurance.\u2018I should\u2019ve finished him earlier.\u2019Raon clicked his tongue. He didn\u2019t completely hide his murderous intent because it was his first assassination after a while. It was a regretful situation.\u201cYou are special. Considering your age, it wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement to call you the biggest genius on the continent. However\u2026\u201dThe corners of the Green War Demon\u2019s lips were lifted in the shape of a crescent moon.\u201cI\u2019m also special.\u201dThe intensity of the flame on his axe increased.Whoosh!The axe's strike grew faster and fiercer.Clang!Raon held his sword vertically to block the blow. When he was about to parry it like before, the axe\u2019s blade rotated and pressed on the sword.\u201cI finished figuring out the swordsmanship you\u2019re using. It was a bit difficult because it was a variation of a basic swordsmanship, but it\u2019s over now.\u201dThe Green War Demon wasn\u2019t lying. He was reading into the direction Raon was going to move his sword, preventing him from blocking or parrying.Bam!A different sound roared from the sword and axe clashing. It was a clash of strength.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dRaon groaned despite having been holding it back. His forearm trembled from the strength of the axe, which was too much for him to handle.\u201cDid you know that? Eden\u2019s executives have a special ability.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat I have is a sense. A sense that tells me where you are going to move your sword next.\u201dThe Green War Demon grinned and swung his axe horizontally. The combative energy in his axe created a strange flow and blocked where Raon was going to dodge.\u201cYou talk a lot, just like somebody else I know.\u201dRaon smiled coldly and swung his sword upward.Screech!Along with a sound of sawtooth being twisted, the Green War Demon\u2019s axe went past the blade, heading to the ground.Thud!Raon kicked off from the collapsing ground, piercing the Green War Demon\u2019s chest. He swung his sword to his surprised eyes.Slice!A lethal amount of blood burst out from the left side of his chest.\u201cKeuh!\u201dSwinging his axe haphazardly, he stepped backward.\u201cTsk.\u201dRaon clicked his tongue. He was trying to cut him apart completely, but he was lacking in strength and distance. It was difficult to fight in a body that hadn\u2019t completely grown yet.\u201cY-you bastard. How could you\u2026\u201d\u201cJust like you figured out my swordsmanship, I also analyzed your attacking method.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you expect me to believe that\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy not? If you can do it, then I can do it as well.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie.Thanks to using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 while fighting him, he managed to predict where the axe was going to move next. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but he could predict half of his movements.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dBlood started subsiding from the Green War Demon\u2019s chest. A flame of combative energy burst from his entire body.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Raon Zieghart, nameless Green Demon of Eden.\u201d\u201cBlond hair and red eyes. I\u2019ve been feeling uneasy from the first time I saw\u2026\u201dAs if his murderous intent was taking shape, red energy burst out from his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019ve inherited most of Glenn Zieghart\u2019s blood.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou are dangerous. I\u2019m going to kill you here no matter the cost. For Eden's future.\u201dWham!The combative energy that was spreading around the Green War Demon gathered in the double-edged axe. It looked like a mace made of red blood instead of an axe.\u201cI\u2019m going to destroy everything, you and the Ziegharts behind you alike.\u201dThe Green War Demon ground his teeth and raised his axe.Raon didn\u2019t step back despite witnessing that tremendous amount of power. He brandished his sword, which was swaying to the powerful energy wave.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect opportunity to try it out.\u201dStretching his knee to the front, he turned his sword behind him.Whir!The single flame burning at the extremity of his sword flowed down the edge, splashing as if a tidal wave was carrying it.The \u2018Ten Flames of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.The second door of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation' opened up, and ten flowers blossomed on the blade and started dancing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Green War Demon had never considered Raon a child, not since his surprise attack.He was hiding his presence as well as a wild animal, and his slash had no sign of hesitation.\u2018An assassin, and a highest-level assassin on top of that.\u2019If that monster\u2019s name wasn\u2019t Zieghart, he would\u2019ve thought he was an assassin.However, his surprise attack had only succeeded halfway, and the Green War Demon had the vitality of an orc fighter.He prepared for the next attack while burning up his combative energy and his vitality. It seemed Raon had spent a lot of his power in that surprise attack, as he was unable to move right after.In the meantime, he stopped his shoulder\u2019s bleeding with his combative energy and gathered his power.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019He had lost his arm and shoulder together, but since he managed to survive the first strike, he thought he was going to win without much difficulty.Since he was raised as an assassin, he thought he would be weak in a head on fight.Surrounding his axe with combative energy, he pummeled it down on him. He wanted to split him in two like firewood, but Raon easily managed to deflect the attack.\u2018How can he be proficient at something other than surprise attacks? At that age?\u2019It didn\u2019t make any sense.Even if he was a Zieghart, it was impossible for such a young boy to deflect his attack like that.\u2018He isn\u2019t normal.\u2019The Green War Demon felt uneasy somehow and kept swinging his axe at Raon.However, he managed to defend himself against all his attacks by blocking whatever he could block and evading whatever he needed to evade. He didn\u2019t feel like he was fighting against a young boy anymore, but a swordsman that had gone through countless battlefields.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019The Green War Demon had the orc fighter\u2019s sense of smell. As long as he had that ability to grasp the enemy\u2019s weakness and what they were lacking, he couldn\u2019t possibly lose.\u2018I did it.\u2019He understood everything about the young boy\u2019s swordsmanship. He swung his axe at the weakness he managed to find.Slam!The clashing sound of sword and axe resounded out loud. A satisfying sensation could be felt through his hand. Beheading him was now just a matter of time.He swung his axe at the faltering boy. When he expected blood to gush out from his neck, his sword bent in a direction that he had never seen before to attack him.Clang!Because of the powerful strike and his carelessness, his axe was pushed back and his posture was broken.\u201cArgh!\u201dBefore he managed to regain his footing, Raon attacked him. He swung his sword, slashing through his combative energy.Bam!The sound of his chest and ribs being split apart resounded in his ears, and he felt an excruciating pain.\u201cKeuh!\u201dThe Green War Demon coughed up blood and grabbed his chest with his remaining hand.\u201cYou bastard. How did you even\u2026\u201d\u201cJust like you figured out my swordsmanship, I also analyzed your attacking method.\u201d\u201c...Do you expect me to believe that\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy not? If you can do it, then I can do it as well.\u201dHe gulped.The faint smell of danger was getting stronger. He had a talent that he had never seen before, despite having witnessed countless talented people. He had a premonition that he was going to become Eden\u2019s strongest enemy if he was left alone.\u2018At any cost\u2026\u2019He needed to kill him.Whir!He surrounded his axe by burning up his remaining combative energy and vitality. The double-edged axe\u2019s blade was burning intensely, engulfed in flames.\u201cGrrrrr!\u201dThe moment he was about to strike in order to get rid of the boy named Raon and the other Ziegharts behind him,Crack.His eyes started burning in a crimson color.Whir!The moment he murmured \u2018The Ten Flames of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019, the small flame burning at the tip of his blade spread to the edge and ten flowers of flame blossomed.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis chest tightened as he saw the flames. The injury on his chest, which he\u2019d stopped from bleeding, burst open once more.The boy pointed his burning sword at him, his eyes shining like a demon.\u201cConsider yourself lucky to become the first victim of the \u2018Ten Flames\u2019.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Whir!Raon\u2019s eyes shone, watching the flame surrounding his entire sword.\u2018It was a success.\u2019He thought it was still impossible for him, but he managed to complete the \u2018Ten Flames\u2019 thanks to the enlightenment he\u2019d had during the battle.Whir!Overflowing power, strong enough to cut the Green War Demon apart in his unscathed state, burst from the sword.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dThe Green War Demon\u2019s astonishment could be seen through his helmet.\u201cWh-what the hell are you?! How can you be so strong at this age\u2026\u201dIt looked like his astonishment had surpassed the orc fighter\u2019s instinct, since his voice had returned to a human\u2019s.\u201cThat\u2019s not the important part right now.\u201dRaon took a step forward, spinning his flaming sword.\u201cCome at me.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dWhite steam billowed from his helmet. He started gathering all his remaining energy on his right arm.Thud!He kicked the ground and pierced into him. The double-edged axe that was pummeling down contained all his remaining energy.Clang!The moment the axe was right under his nose, Raon thrust the sword he was keeping at his back.\u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation, Ten Flames\u2019.\u2018Flame\u2019s Dancing Wind\u2019.The flower blossoms sitting on his blade spread out and started rotating. It looked like a whirlwind was rising from his sword as a tremendous firepower split apart the Green War Demon\u2019s combative energy.Bam!Facing the power of Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation\u2019s sword technique, Flame\u2019s Dancing Wind\u2014which could be used after completing the Ten Flames\u2014the Green War Demon grit his teeth.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet! I\u2019m going to get rid of you at any cost\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s already over.\u201dRaon calmly declared, swinging his sword.Slash!The combative energy, already torn apart, couldn't withstand the Ten Flames\u2019 fire. The flaming silver blade pierced through the Green War Demon\u2019s heart.\u201cKeuh, y-you Ziegh\u2026\u201dUnable to finish his last sentence, he collapsed on his back.Clang!The dark green helmet on his head split in half, along with his armor. A young man in his twenties was found dead inside of it, with his eyes white.Raon extinguished the Ten Flames\u2019 fire.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe breathed out roughly, feeling his pent-up exhaustion. He was about to sink to his knees as his strength left his legs, but he endured it and turned around.He could feel the gazes of the trainees and the villagers, full of various emotions like astonishment, shock, relief, awe, etc.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! Are you seriously\u2026\u201dBurren\u2019s lip trembled, unable to finish his sentence, and Runaan sank to her knees as if she was more anxious than he was. Martha\u2019s eyes were shining, as if she was going to pounce at him at once.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201dRaon raised his sword, pointing at the bewildered green demons. Since they had never expected the Green War Demon to lose, they were at a complete loss.\u201cWipe them all out!\u201d\u201cWaaaah!\u201dThe trainees, who's fighting spirit could pierce the heavens thanks to Raon\u2019s victory, dashed at the green demons surrounding the battlefield.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon rotated the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 to melt down the exhaustion surrounding his body and started filling his energy center with aura.\u2018This is so great.\u2019The \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 was most effective after the fight, despite being also useful before and during it.The aura that he had exhausted was full to bursting once again, like a boat riding a strong current, and lactic acid filling his muscles were melting away.On top of that, it stopped the coldness inside his mana circuit from rampaging\u2014which was about to happen\u2014so it was truly the greatest cultivation method in many ways.\u2018This is pretty funny.\u2019Since he had obtained the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 while running away after fighting against Eden, it could be considered funny.They were also the enemies that had killed his father and his sister, though.\u201cYeeah!\u201d\u201cKill all the green demons!\u201d\u201cFinish the battle!\u201dSince Raon was still standing and watching them, the green demons didn\u2019t dare attack back nor run away. They just offered their necks to the trainees.The battle ended in less than ten minutes, and the trainees were the only ones standing in front of the wooden fence.\u201cRaon.\u201dAfter slaying the last green demon, Runaan ran up to him and grabbed his shoulder. It seemed to be her way of complimenting him.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dBurren approached him after that.\u201cHaa, y-you were right. The enemies were strong, and we were weak. It looks like I was blinded from that one victory. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe bowed while biting his lip, so much that it could be mistaken as a pledge of obedience.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, not only us but the villagers we were supposed to save would also have died. Thank you. And I\u2019m sorry. However\u2026\u201dBurren continued, while raising his head.\u201cI would\u2019ve still gone to help them. Even if I\u2019m too weak, ignoring injustice isn\u2019t what a Zieghart swordsman would do.\u201d\u201cYou did well.\u201dRaon nodded, meeting Burren\u2019s green eyes.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI managed to find the Green War Demon\u2019s opening thanks to you fighting with everything you have. You took a great part in this victory.\u201d\u201cWh-what are your intentions?! What do you want from me?!\u201dHearing a compliment he had never expected, Burren\u2019s fingers trembled in nervousness.\u201cI\u2019m being honest.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I-it will be different next time.\u201dBurren murmured, lowering his head.\u201cI\u2019m going to be strong enough to catch up to you in the future and do my job properly!\u201dHe bowed once again. It was his expression of gratitude, for saving his life and giving him enlightenment.\u201cThank you for saving me and everyone\u2019s lives.\u201dAfter saying that, Burren entered the village along with the collaterals. It looked like they were going to start the reconstruction right away.Considering the way he was thinking about the village in that situation, he really had the talent to become a leader.\u201cMartha.\u201dRaon called Martha, who was standing still with her arms crossed.\u201cGood job. I managed to direct the fight in my favor thanks to you doing your job.\u201dIf Martha didn\u2019t attract the Green War Demon\u2019s attention until the end, he would\u2019ve failed his surprise attack and the fight would\u2019ve been a lot more difficult.She had done better than she was told.\u201cI should bite my tongue and kill myself if I can\u2019t even follow the instructions.\u201dAfter swaying her corner of her lips, Martha turned her head and entered the village. Despite what she said, she seemed to like the compliment.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon sighed. Probably because his tension had disappeared completely, the strength left his legs regardless of his body\u2019s exhaustion.Tap.As he was about to collapse back, he felt something soft touch his back. He turned his head and saw Runaan supporting him.\u201cYou looked like you were going to collapse.\u201dShe nodded her head.\u201cHow did you realize that?\u201d\u201cIt was the same during the training.\u201dRunaan nodded head, her mouth closed.\u201cI see.\u201dJust as he had been watching the other trainees, it seemed they had been watching him as well.\u201cHa.\u201dRaon snickered and sat down. He wanted to fall asleep. He had been too tense.[You have surpassed\u2026]Multiple messages were appearing in front of his eyes, but he didn\u2019t have any energy left to read them. He just closed his eyes and fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was inside a log house that he had never seen before. It looked like he was still in Cebu village.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201dHe checked the messages once again. They were about the ability, title, and trait that he had obtained through his fight against the Green War Demon.\u2026Why are you getting so many rewards for defeating such a weakling?Wrath ground his teeth. He seemed displeased about the fact that he was getting rewarded.He was just a tenacious idiot. And yet, you are getting stats, a title, and even a trait. This is ridiculous.\u2018It\u2019s your ability, though.\u2019Raon raised his hand to push away Wrath, who was emanating coldness and wrath at the same time.Damn it! I didn\u2019t realize when I was using it, but that\u2019s seriously\u2026Wrath didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but Raon could understand him nonetheless.\u2018This is certainly a cheat.\u2019Raon slowly nodded and opened the status window.Status WindowName: Raon Zieghart.Title: \u2018Indomitable\u2019State: Curse of Frost (Five Strands)Trait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Four-Stars), Water Resistance (Four-Stars), Perception of the Snow Flower (Three-Stars), Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation (Three-Stars), Coldness of the Frost (Three-Stars), Fire Resistance (Three-Stars), Bleeding Curse (One-Stars), Backstab (One-Star).\u2014Strength: 57Agility: 58Stamina: 59Energy: 42Perception: 64The first thing he noticed was the title. It had changed from the \u2018First Victory\u2019 to \u2018Indomitable\u2019. He noticed despite the title having changed, the effect of the previous title still remained. He checked the new title.IndomitableTitle given to one who has displayed their unyielding spirit during a fight against a stronger opponent.Effect: All stats increase by 3% upon fighting a stronger opponent.\u2018Is this for real?\u2019Raon furrowed his brows. A three percent increase didn\u2019t look like a big deal, but it was an ability that got better the stronger he was.Since most of the opponents he was going to face in the future would be stronger than him, the title\u2019s effect could also be considered semi-permanent.\u2018Then next\u2026\u2019He then checked the new trait, \u2018Backstab\u2019.Backstab (One-Star)Upon performing a surprise attack or assassination, your presence decreases and the chance to inflict critical injury increases.\u2018It\u2019s a trait specialized for assassination.\u2019It was a trait that decreased his presence and increased the chance of a critical hit.\u2018If only I had this before\u2026\u2019The Green War Demon had noticed his presence before he had started to attack him.If only he had the trait beforehand, he might\u2019ve been able to finish him off in a single strike.\u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to obtain those abilities in that case.\u2019Since he had gotten stronger after a difficult battle, it was a misfortune turned into a blessing.Raon closed the status window after checking the increased stats.\u2018I\u2019m getting stronger day by day thanks to you. Thank you.\u2019Keuh\u2026Wrath, who couldn\u2019t see the status window, was glaring at him with his blue eyes.You won\u2019t be able to die peacefully. I\u2019m going to chew on your body over and over and over, then make you suffer for eternity.\u2018Do it if you can.\u2019Since Raon was on his second life, after having already experienced the worst death ever, Wrath\u2019s anger and threats were something he could scoff at.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRaon stretched his body and stood up. The muscle pain and headache that he was suffering from had disappeared, probably thanks to the increased stats.Rattle.Once he opened the door and went outside, he could see the black sky, just like when he collapsed. It seemed he had slept for an entire day.\u201cIt\u2019s rebuilt.\u201dThe village\u2019s wooden fence was rebuilt, sturdier and higher than before. It looked like all the trainees had worked together.\u201cRaon?\u201dHe turned upon hearing a surprised voice, only to see Runaan standing there. Judging from how she was holding a washbasin, it looked like she was on her way to his room.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRaon nodded. His condition had returned to normal after a long sleep.\u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cDinner. Everyone\u2019s gathered.\u201dShe pointed to her back with her finger.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon rubbed his stomach. He was indeed hungry since he didn\u2019t eat anything for over an entire day.\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRaon followed Runaan to the center of the village. Fire was burning from a big brazier at the center, and the villagers and the trainees were gathered around it.A few people couldn\u2019t be seen\u2014they must\u2019ve been standing guard.\u201cHuh? Raon!\u201d\u201cSir Raon!\u201d\u201cRaon Zieghart!\u201d\u201cTh-the benefactor woke up!\u201d\u201cBenefactor!\u201dThe trainees and the villagers, who were sitting in a circle around the brazier, stood up at once and shouted.\u201cH-how\u2019s your body? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you woke up!\u201dBurren ran up to him with wide eyes first, the other trainees following and examining him with worried gazes.\u201cBenefactor!\u201d\u201cThank you for saving the village! Benefactor!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve fought so much for the sake of our village\u2026\u201dThe villagers, including the village chief, also ran up to him and knelt to express their gratitude.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon swallowed, watching them all.Everyone\u2019s gazes\u2026He could see the emotions contained in those eyes. Thanks, gratitude, repayment, awe.From the trainees\u2019 eyes, he could see embarrassment, gratitude, awe, aspiration, yearning, etc.They had decided that Raon would be their role model, and they would follow and pursue his swordsmanship.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon received the people\u2019s gazes, the ones that were touching his heart deeply.His heart fluttered.An emotion he had never felt before was enveloping his heart.When he was an assassin in his previous life, he had never received emotions of gratitude, acknowledgement, and yearning.Life and death were the only things that existed then.He put his life on the line to kill people and gather information for the sake of House Robert, yet the acknowledgement and reward all went to the public people\u2014like Derus Robert.It was his first time in either of his lives getting acknowledged like that.He was thrilled, in a different way than when he felt accomplished from training his swordsmanship or aura.He looked at everyone once again.The villagers were shouting out their gratitude, and the trainees were worrying about him with gazes full of yearning and awe.\u2018Yes, from now on\u2026.\u2019Raon clenched his fist. Since he was going to live as a swordsman instead of an assassin, it was a sight he was going to behold countless times in the future.He wanted more.The desire to become acknowledged even more and receive more yearning gazes was born inside him.Even more in the future\u2026* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon visited the village chief after finishing his meal. The village chief was flustered, bending forward significantly to bow.\u201cCan I talk to you for a moment?\u201d\u201cO-of course!\u201dHe raised the village chief\u2019s body, which was rolled up like a larva, and brought him to a corner.\u201cAre you already aware of the identity of those who attacked the village?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I know that they are a group called Eden, who can control monsters.\u201dThe village chief nodded. Even a small village like that was aware of Eden's infamy.\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand why we became their target. It\u2019s a small village with nothing to gain for them\u2026\u201dThe village chief shook his head, murmuring that it was weird.\u201cI heard about it while fighting against them, but didn\u2019t you obtain a red gem from Cebu Mountain in the past?\u201d\u201cRed gem? Ah, I have one. I found it in the mountains when I was young and brought it to the village\u2026 W-wait, no way!\u201d\u201cYes, that gem was their target.\u201dThe village chief\u2019s eyes widened at hearing Raon\u2019s words.\u201cTh-then, all of this happened because of that pebble\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHe nodded. He needed to tell him honestly so that he would give him the gem of his own accord.\u201cTh-the village was almost destroyed because of me! Oh, no! It was all my fault!\u201dThe village chief sank on his knees and started hitting the ground.\u201cEden\u2019s demons will keep coming to the village as long as the gem remains here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been treating it like a guardian deity, since the soil had become fertile, and the cold had subsided ever since I buried the gem underground. Something like that\u2026\u201dRaon became more certain after hearing it from the village chief. The goblin king was a monster with a powerful fire attribute. Since it was a gem left behind by him, it must\u2019ve been warming up the village.\u201cTh-then what shall I do? Shall I throw away the gem now\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it with me.\u201d\u201cPardon? Is the benefactor really going to?\u201d\u201cEden is an extremely evil group that tries to erase humanity from the continent. They will most likely end up obtaining it if you throw it away, so I\u2019ll bring it to Zieghart.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t commit another offense to you like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. That\u2019s what Zieghart does.\u201d\u201cAah!\u201dRaon said something Burren would say. The village chief seemed to be impressed, his eyes glittering like morning dew.\u201cZieghart is granting us another favor that we can\u2019t return.\u201d\u201cAnother?\u201d\u201cYes. The current head of house, Glenn Zieghart, saved our village a few decades ago. I think it was when I was slightly older than the benefactor.\u201dThe village chief raised his chin as if he were reminiscing about the past, looking up at the starry sky.\u201cThe head of house did?\u201d\u201cYes. He saved the entire village just like the benefactor and treated us kindly with a smile.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon tilted his head.\u2018Kindness and a smile, huh\u2026\u2019It was impossible to imagine, considering how Glenn looked currently.\u201cAww, this old man just blabbered about the past. Come this way, I\u2019ll hand it over right now.\u201dThe village chief scratched his head in embarrassment and went to his house, located to the east.\u2018So even that person used to be like that.\u2019Raon imagined Glenn\u2019s smile, who was now like a block of ice, and followed the village chief.***The village chief\u2019s house was at the western end, where Raon had woken up. Since the village chief\u2019s house was usually located at the center, it was unusual for it to be at the end.\u201cSo, this was the village chief\u2019s house. Please excuse me.\u201d\u201cOh, it was nothing!\u201dThe village chief waved his hand at Raon.\u201cBut don\u2019t village chiefs usually live at the center?\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019ve been living here all along, I grew attached to it and didn\u2019t really want to leave.\u201dThe village chief scratched his chin and went to the yard.\u201cI\u2019ve buried it here. I thought it was a blessing since it was warming up the village, but it was actually a curse.\u201dHe started digging a small field in the yard. After digging for about thirty minutes, he finally took out something wrapped in a black fabric.\u201c\u2026What is that fabric?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a wrapping cloth passed down for generations in my family. Since this pebble was shining so intensely, I wrapped it so it wouldn\u2019t be noticed.\u201dWhile saying that, the village chief unraveled the fabric.Whir!Along with an intense heat, a powerful red light shone upon the dim garden. It seemed like the whole world had become bright with an enormous fire.\u2018This is the goblin king\u2019s magic stone\u2026\u2019If Eden managed to obtain that magic stone, they would\u2019ve created a new monster possessing the goblin king\u2019s abilities.\u201cSir, wrap it back in that cloth for no\u2026\u201d\u201cThat was why.\u201dAs Raon was about to tell him to hide the gem once again, a calm and deep voice could be heard from the right side.\u201cHuh!\u201dRaon raised his head, standing in front of the village chief.A general in a battlefield would\u2019ve looked like him.He looked rough and fierce, his body full of scars. He had an extremely large build, and the way he was standing on a thin wooden fence with that big body of his looked out of this world.The most distinct feature was his eyes. Madness could be seen in his yellow eyes, making the hair on his neck stand on end.\u2018I couldn\u2019t even sense him, though?\u2019Since he didn\u2019t even manage to perceive him despite his huge build, he wasn\u2019t just an expert.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cMe? I wonder?\u201dAs he flicked his finger, a green helmet appeared in front of his eyes. It had a round shape with buck teeth protruding to top and bottom, and a single horn existed on its head.Ogre.The helmet was in the shape of a monster known as the tyrant of the mountains, and the man was spinning it on his finger.\u201cGuess who I am.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOgre.It was a monster called the tyrant of the mountains because of its outstanding intelligence on top of its powerful strength and agility.Since it was one of the fiercest monsters, they often ended up killing the mage that tamed them.Of course, Eden\u2014which used the monsters\u2019 power\u2014also had a monster that had the ogre\u2019s characteristics transferred.The Blood Raving Demon.The name, which signified he was crazy for blood, was a really suitable name for an ogre known for its ferocity and madness.\u201c\u2026Are you the Blood Raving Demon?\u201dRaon chewed his lip. He could feel the blood gushing out from his lip, spilling down his chin.\u201cEven though you are a Zieghart sprout, you must have some sharp eyes to recognize this helmet at a glance.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon giggled, grabbing the helmet he was spinning.\u201cAnd I can\u2019t determine your might for sure. Did you slay the Green War Demon?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s hands trembled, unable to respond. The Blood Raving Demon was too powerful for his current self to handle, no\u2014it was impossible, even if he combined forces with everyone else.\u201cWhy is someone like you here\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the one who gave the mission to the Green War Demon. I never imagined he would die so easily.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon snickered and stood up. His enormous height made him look like a steel tower soaring on the wooden fence.\u201cThat fabric is called Dark. It has a special effect of hiding the energy inside of it. Old man, you were lucky. Your village would\u2019ve been turned into ashes from the beginning if you hadn\u2019t covered it with that.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon kindly explained about the fabric enveloping the goblin king\u2019s magic stone.\u201cWell, my turn ended up coming thanks to that.\u201dHe equipped the huge ogre\u2019s helmet on his head.Obviously, it didn\u2019t fit. However, the helmet started vibrating oddly once he started using his aura.Rumble!With the sound of something spinning from the inside, the helmet started to shrink in size to fit the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s head.Whir!Green rusty water gushed from the helmet, covering the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s entire body. The ogre\u2019s armor, with noticeable muscles at the size of a boulder, started to form.\u2018There\u2019s no opening.\u2019Raon bit his lip. He wanted to attack, but the Blood Raving Demon wasn\u2019t showing the slightest opening.Rumble!Once the lunatic light burst from the helmet\u2019s empty eyes, he couldn\u2019t breathe for a moment.Raon Zieghart.As he was barely enduring it, Wrath burst out from the bracelet. His voice was as heavy as lead.I\u2019m going to be honest. You have two choices right now.\u2018Choices?\u2019Either you get killed by him or give your body to the King of Essence.Wrath declared solemnly, as if he was merely stating the truth.Those are the only choices you have right now.***Burren Zieghart was double checking the wooden fence that he had installed with the other trainees.\u2018It\u2019s pretty good.\u2019Since they had used the method learned from the instructors, the fence\u2019s durability wasn\u2019t too bad despite having been built in a short time.It looked like it could withstand orcs or goblin attacks without much difficulty.The materials mostly came out from Dorian\u2019s pocket. It was helpful, but he couldn\u2019t understand why he was carrying all that.\u201cSir Burren, Raon has disappeared along with the village chief. Is that alright?\u201dThe collateral that was right behind him approached him and whispered.\u201cSo what?\u201dBurren turned around and asked back.\u201cI mean, the village chief might give him some treasure, and if he takes them for himself\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a meaningless worry.\u201dHe snickered and shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m sure you are also aware of it. If Raon wasn\u2019t here, not only us but the entire village would\u2019ve drowned in our own blood. Whatever he receives or learns isn\u2019t for us to argue. And\u2026\u201dThe collaterals shut their mouths, hearing his voice coming from the bottom of his heart.\u201cWe are all using the name Zieghart. Competing between us in order to get stronger is fine, but there\u2019s no reason to fight or begrudge each other when we are outside. You must've realized this to a certain extent already.\u201d\u201cHmm, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe collateral trainees nodded.\u2018He is correct.\u2019The trainees had been deeply impressed by Raon from the battle against the Green War Demon. Honestly, they couldn\u2019t feel any hatred or jealousy against him anymore.\u201cIt looks like the insects have finally come to their senses.\u201d\u201cMartha?\u201dBurren raised his head, hearing the belittling voice. Martha was swinging her legs on top of a tree next to the wooden fence.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI came to check if you built the wooden fence properly.\u201d\u201cHow is the wooden fence then?\u201d\u201cNot too bad considering your sloppiness. I guess your head isn\u2019t completely made of stones.\u201d\u201cGet out of my sight if you\u2019ve finished checking. We are going to finish up here.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one person who can order me around.\u201dMartha came down from the tree, snorting. As she was about to walk towards Burren, a rustling sound could be heard from the bushes.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u201cRight there, come out!\u201dAs Burren and Martha lowered their postures, a silver-haired girl burst out of the bush.\u201cRunaan?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cFruits.\u201dRunaan showed them the basket she was holding. It contained ripe golden apples.\u201cWhy are you harvesting that here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to give them to Raon.\u201d\u201cYou can just give him the ones the villagers have already harvested.\u201d\u201cThis is fresher.\u201dRunaan quietly responded with blank eyes.\u201cYou act like you\u2019re already married.\u201dMartha provoked her with cold eyes, but Runaan took her basket without showing any reaction.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dIt was when she was about to leave.Baaam!A thunderous noise, loud enough to shake the earth, roared from the village\u2019s outskirts.\u201cWh-what\u2019s happening!\u201d\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dBurren, Runaan, and Martha, who were squatting on the ground while covering their heads, opened their eyes wide.\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the direction Raon and the village chief were headed!\u201dRunaan and Martha started to move first.\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency! You guys go and get your weapons, call the other trainees!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dBurren gave out the instructions while following the other two.Baang!As everyone was about to run towards Raon\u2019s location, another powerful energy burst out, reaching the village\u2019s center.Baam!A blond-haired boy holding something in his arms bounced out from between the collapsing buildings.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cGasp!\u201dRunaan and Martha\u2019s jaws dropped, noticing the boy rolling on the ground.\u201cRaon?\u201d\u201cR-Raon Zieghart!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The boy was Raon. He was biting his lip with an even more nervous expression than when he was facing the Green War Demon.\u201cRunaan!\u201dRaon called Runaan\u2019s name and threw the thing he was holding in his arms at her.\u201cMmhm.\u201dRunaan ran ahead and caught the thing Raon had thrown at her. It was the unconscious village chief, who was bleeding from his forehead.\u201cRunaan. Martha. Don\u2019t come over here! Escape this place immediately!\u201dHis expression wasn\u2019t just urgent, but he looked like he was about to gasp his life away.\u201cJust what happened\u2026?\u201dMartha stopped approaching Raon, looking towards the west.Thud!A fierce step sounded like the earth was screaming, and the sandy dust filling the air scattered away.A green giant, which looked like the personification of a mountain, was approaching them. The muscles in his arms and legs were as hard as a lump of boulders, and his yellow eyes were burning with madness.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cO-ogre\u2019s armor\u2026\u201dThe man was wearing the tyrant of the mountain\u2019s helmet and armor. Martha and Runaan\u2019s thoughts stopped as they faced his energy wave.\u201cB-Blood Raving Demon\u2026\u201dThe name of the man wearing an ogre's helmet spilled from Martha\u2019s mouth.The bloody name made the atmosphere even heavier.\u201cThere were some cute fellows over here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMadness shimmered from the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s helmet. Martha and Runaan\u2019s legs trembled, as if they were going to collapse at any time.\u201cRaon! What\u2019s happening this ti\u2026Ah!\u201dBurren and the trainees that followed them froze in surprise. Their bodies were frozen stiff from the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s pressure.\u201cYou are rather slow, despite using Zieghart's name.\u201d\u201cAah\u2026\u201d\u201cPu\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon\u2019s eyes sparkled yellow. Under the predator\u2019s intense murderous intent, the trainees knelt down while grabbing their chests.\u201cPull yourselves together!\u201dAs the trainees were about to collapse, Raon\u2019s clear voice pierced through the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fear.Whir!Raon\u2019s clean energy spread out and the light returned to the trainees\u2019 misty eyes.\u201cWe will be annihilated if you keep sitting there like idiots! Burren! Command the trainees to prepare the villagers! Martha and Runaan, keep your distance and prepare for diversions!\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u201cA-alright. I\u2019ll return right after!\u201dBurren ran back while gritting his teeth. Runaan and Martha split to the sides while using their aura.\u201cConsider yourselves dead if you get hit by his fist. Never fight him head on, just assist me.\u201dRaon spoke quietly, without taking his eyes off the Blood Raving Demon.Runaan and Martha nodded at once.\u201cDo you remember what Instructor Rimmer told us every time? We have to surpass our limits.\u201dRaon continued while gritting his teeth.\u201cNow is the time. We have to surpass the limits of both our bodies and minds.\u201d\u201cSurpass your limits?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon grinned, then clenched his fist. The red combative energy burst up, distorting the air.\u201cI wonder if that\u2019s enough.\u201d***Whir!Raon brandished his sword while relieving his tension by rotating the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018It was a single strike.\u2019Despite having dodged the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist, his skin still broke. It was truly an overwhelming power, an endless strength.\u2018It would\u2019ve been difficult even in my previous life\u2026\u2019Assassination was a different story, but he couldn\u2019t be sure whether he could\u2019ve won against the monster even if he had his previous life\u2019s body.It really was a desperate situation, but he couldn\u2019t just resign. He needed to find an opening somehow and cut his head off.\u2018But\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t find it.As if an endless cliff had become a human, he couldn\u2019t find the slightest opening.\u201cYou were acting as if you were going to attack at any time, but are you really going to?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon grinned, holding his chin up high.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t coming to me, then I\u2019m going to you!\u201dHe stomped the ground, crushing the earth. Raon\u2019s sight was immediately filled with the Blood Raving Demon. It was a ridiculous speed.Whoosh!The Blood Raving Demon that approached him at a super speed thrust his fist. Raon slashed his sword towards the fist, the size of a boulder, aimed at his head.\u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation Ten Flames\u2019.\u2018Revolving Sky\u2019.The flaming sword slashed through the air, rushing at the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist.\u201cThat\u2019s some nice firepower!\u201dAlong with a delightful voice, the Blood Raving Demon turned his fist. Bright red combative energy appeared, clashing with the \u2018Revolving Sky\u2019.Baam!The snake of flame that surrounded the sword dissipated, pressed upon by the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s aura.\u201cHup!\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes were distorted. The Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fists were aimed at his heart after erasing his strike with the \u2018Revolving Sky\u2019.\u201cKuaaaah!\u201dHe twisted his sword while screaming. The Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist was deflected to the side, following the side of the sword.Slam!Along with a threatening destructive sound, the buildings on the right side collapsed at once.\u201cHuff!\u201dRaon stepped backward, catching his breath. Despite having deflected the attack, his shoulder was hurting as if it was dislocated.\u2018I almost died there.\u2019A cold sweat flowed down his forehead.If he hadn\u2019t managed to read the trajectory of his fist using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, his head would\u2019ve burst like a tomato.He looked aside.Runaan and Martha were biting their lips, not knowing what to do.\u2018Not yet.\u2019Raon conveyed his intention with his gaze. Now wasn\u2019t the time to move, but to observe.He needed to endure the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s attacks as much as possible in order to show them his movements before they participated in the fight.It was necessary in order to create a slight chance of victory, as small as ten percent\u2014no, more like one percent.Whir!Raon created the fire of the Ten Flames once again. The flame starting from the sword\u2019s extremity surrounded its edge.\u201cGreat. It would be no fun if the flame was extinguished with a single punch!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon jumped like a bird, striking with his fist.Using the sixth form of the \u2018Star-Combining Sword\u2019, Raon parried the fists falling down like meteorites.Squeeze!The red combative energy spreading from the Blood Raving Demon started to press on the Ten Flames once again.\u201cA powerful fire attribute aura. It\u2019s strong enough that I understand why that stupid Green War Demon was defeated by you. However, that won\u2019t work against me. Do you know the reason?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon smiled menacingly and thrust his fist.\u201cOf course I do.\u201dDodging the fist with a paper-thin difference, Raon swung his sword.\u201cIt\u2019s your trait.\u201d\u201cYou are well aware of it. That\u2019s right. Flame can\u2019t cut through me.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon giggled, striking with his palm. Raon barely managed to dodge it, but blood gushed out from his chin at the wind pressure.\u201cSomething like an aura of flame is meaningless against me, who has inherited the ogre\u2019s strength!\u201dHe was telling the truth.An Ogre was a monster that was resistant to the fire attribute, capable of destroying a castle after getting hit by dozens of fire arrows.However, the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 wasn\u2019t the only weapon Raon had.\u201cThen I can just use something else.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA blue frost burst from Raon\u2019s red eyes.The \u2018Coldness of the Frost\u2019.The blue light like an ocean filled the white blade he was holding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is that a water attribute?\u201dPanic appeared in the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s yellow eyes.\u201cUsing water attribute aura after using a ridiculously powerful fire attribute aura, what\u2019s your identity?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201dRaon twisted his sword and slashed, shooting the frost gathered on his blade.\u201cHuh, you can even use the aura blade.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon thrust his fist while gasping in amazement. The boulder-like fist shattered the pure white aura blade.Even though his full-power aura blade had been shattered, Raon\u2019s eyes remained calm.'Because the attack wasn\u2019t the only effect of the frost.\u2019Along with a sound of freezing lake, pure white ice sprouted on the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s hand.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon frowned and glared at his freezing hand. It looked like he was trying to clench his fist and failing.\u201cDid you even reach the attribute\u2019s enlightenment? You really know no bounds.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout letting down his guard, Raon shot another aura blade containing the \u2018Coldness of the Frost\u2019.\u2018I can\u2019t be careless.\u2019His head would be blown away in an instant if he let his guard down because his attack was somewhat effective.He needed to consider his defense while attacking and change his position continuously with footwork.\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u201dInstead of throwing a punch like before, the Blood Raving Demon rotated his body and dodged the aura blade.Clang!Raon swung his sword, controlling as much \u2018Coldness of the Frost\u2019 as he could. The intense cold emanating from the blade filled the space.Whir!The ground froze and the atmosphere\u2019s temperature decreased, gradually slowing down the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s movements.\u2018I\u2019m glad I watched her before.\u2019Raon looked at Runaan, who was biting her lip. Thanks to having observed how she spread the frost before, he was able to use the aura of cold without much difficulty.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon moved restlessly to avoid the frost covering the ground and the aura blade that Raon was shooting.His fist, which used to be quick and powerful, was slowing down and weakening.\u201cKuaaah! You little rat!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon screamed and thrust his fist.Whoosh!Raon turned his ankle to dodge the blow and slashed his sword once again. The frigid aura blade cut through the air.\u201cKeugh!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon stepped backwards in order to avoid the frost, groaning.Raon\u2019s dominance seemed to be apparent.However, the tension didn\u2019t disappear from Raon\u2019s deep eyes. He kept swinging his sword with an even more intense pressure than at the start of the fight.\u2018The chance hasn't come yet.\u2019***\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dAfter preparing everyone, Burren returned to the village with ten trainees.The village center was in ruins, as if it had been under a magical bombardment. He could see fire raging on one side, and the other side\u2019s ground was completely frozen. It was truly a strange sight.Slam!He turned his head towards the thunderous noise coming from the left. Or rather, his head automatically turned before he even heard the sound.Raon, whose sword was surrounded in a blue light, was crossing his sword with the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist at a point-blank distance.\u2018Aura blade? When did he reach Sword Expert\u2026?\u2019Using an aura blade signified that he had reached the novice level of Sword Expert. The fact that he was a novice level Expert at the age of fifteen baffled him despite the situation.\u2018No, wait! Raon\u2019s aura is\u2026\u2019Burren\u2019s astonishment didn\u2019t end with his aura blade. His eyes became so wide that they looked like they were going to pop out upon seeing the frost rising from Raon\u2019s blade.\u2018Frost!\u2019It was an aura of ice even more intense and sharp than Runaan\u2019s. He gasped at the fact that he had been hiding such a thing so far.\u2018To have an aura of frost and being an Expert\u2026 What exactly is the height you\u2019ve reached?\u2019The continent\u2019s warriors had divided might into different ranks.They were levels that were used regardless of the weapon: sword, spear, bow, and fist alike. Anyone who began to use aura was allowed to be called a Beginner.Beginner rank was separated into novice, intermediate, and advanced. Upon getting accustomed to their aura and becoming capable of imbuing their weapon with aura, one could become a User.User rank also had the same levels: novice, intermediate and advanced. The next rank was the Expert level, which was when they became capable of discharging the aura from their weapon.It was commonly referred to as the level where they could use the aura blade, and it was Raon\u2019s current level.The Blood Raving Demon was generally known to be at the highest level of Expert, or at the Master level.And yet, Raon was pushing the Blood Raving Demon into a corner despite being at the novice level of the Expert rank, which was far lower than his opponent. Burren\u2019s heart was filled with passion upon realizing that.\u201cHaa.\u201dBurren shivered.\u2018Monster\u2026\u2019Rather than the Blood Raving Demon, who was exploding the surroundings each time he thrust his fist, he was more frightened by Raon, who was facing him.It wasn't simply because he was using two auras and had reached the Expert rank at such a young age.Swordsmanship and footwork.The fact that he was fighting the Blood Raving Demon while using basic swordsmanship and footwork that anyone could use was giving him goosebumps.Whoosh!Raon\u2019s movements were swift. Like a flower petal riding a typhoon, he dodged the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist by using the wind pressure preceding it.That was only possible through a tremendous amount of effort, regardless of his skill or talent, and Raon was a monster of effort.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Raon\u2019s attacks were sharp, but they couldn\u2019t inflict any noticeable amount of damage to the Blood Raving Demon. All it could do was freeze his right arm in frost.\u2018There\u2019s a difference in power after all. Then\u2026 huh?\u2019Burren narrowed his eyes as he observed the battle between the two. Raon was glancing at him while swinging his sword.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019Probably because they had been together for over three years, he could immediately notice the intentions behind Raon\u2019s gaze.\u2018He is asking me to help.\u2019Raon\u2019s gaze was telling him to attack together with him through an opening he would create.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe looked around at the sides.Martha and Runaan had also noticed his intentions, and were quickly operating their aura so that they could make their move whenever they wanted to.\u2018That\u2019s right. The Blood Raving Demon isn\u2019t a big deal, since we are Ziegharts.\u2019He clenched his fist and gathered the aura from his energy center. He drew his sword while feeling the green wind surrounding him.\u2018We are going to save this place!\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Burren focused on the fight between Raon and the Blood Raving Demon, his eyes wide.Since the opportunity could come at any time, he kept controlling his aura while breathing steadily.As his hand was about to be covered in sweat from watching the fight between the two monsters\u2026Raon\u2019s sword hit the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s left hand.Crackle!With the sound of icicles forming, the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s hand froze.\u201cDo it now! Use everything you have!\u201dBurren had already started moving before Raon said it.Thud!He brandished his sword and kicked the ground to jump towards the Blood Raving Demon.The same sound could be heard from the left and right. Runaan and Martha were running with him.Whir!From the swords that Burren, Runaan, and Martha were holding, their auras burst out like the sun erasing the night.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon was grinding his teeth, his frozen hands trembling in panic.\u2018We can win!\u2019Looking at his panicked face, he became certain. He could win.Whir!As they were about to perform their most powerful attack against the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s vital points\u2026\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dBurren, Runaan, and Martha raised their heads at the atmosphere that suddenly became heavier. Their eyes widened at the same time.The Blood Raving Demon\u2019s eyes, which had been full of panic, had become ice cold.Their hearts dropped upon seeing his completely composed eyes, despite still containing madness.Creak!The atmosphere was distorted by the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s atrocious smile.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this, you insects.\u201d***Crack!The Blood Raving Demon thrust his aura-filled fist. The wind pressure accompanying the strike crushed the ground.However, Raon thrust his sword while withstanding the pressure. He pierced the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s shoulder with the icy blue sword.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon ground his teeth, his gaze a blazing yellow.However, there was no anger or frustration at the bottom of his heart. He was simply filled with interest and curiosity.\u2018A genius that will be spoken of throughout the continent\u2019s history, huh.\u2019Judging from his appearance and skin, he was only in his mid-teens. And yet, he could skillfully handle an aura blade and auras with both fire and water attributes.He was a genius that could become the continent\u2019s strongest one day.\u2018However\u2026\u2019That would only be possible if he could keep growing up as he was.The Blood Raving Demon looked around. Excluding the monster named Raon, the three other children behind him also possessed extraordinary talent.Slash!Raon\u2019s aura blade sliced his chest a little, but his heart didn\u2019t waver in the slightest.It was just a matter of course.He hadn\u2019t even used one-tenth of his power, despite how he looked on the outside.Huff.The Blood Raving Demon breathed out hot air from his helmet.He could only smile. The anticipation of trampling over the young sprouts sent chills down his spine.Clang!Raon shot his aura blade with excellent timing.\u201cKeuh!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon waved his left hand to block the aura blade, pretending to be flustered despite being more than capable of dodging it.Crackle!The white frost spread and his hand started to freeze.\u201cDo it now! Use everything you have!\u201dAt Raon\u2019s command, Runaan, Burren, and Martha\u2014who were gathering their power\u2014rushed at the Blood Raving Demon together.Whir!Burren imbued his sword with wind, Martha was pouring out all the energy of Earth she had, and Runaan was spreading the frost like an icicle from her blade.The three of them performed their most powerful attacks, using every single bit of aura they had.Whir!Raon ran straight towards the Blood Raving Demon, swinging his sword burning in blue.\u201cKyaha!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon laughed at that instant. It was the instant where his prey was perfectly caught in his net.Baam!The entirety of the ogre helmet shone in yellow. A tremendous amount of energy burst out, breaking through the white ice confining his hand.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this. You insects.\u201dThe moment the Zieghart\u2019s younglings used his opening to attack him with everything they had was the perfect time to sink them into the depths of despair.Rumble!The yellow light that formed on the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s hands exploded. The materialized aura perfectly covering his huge hands was\u2026Astral Energy.A Master\u2019s proof, the astral energy was burning in his hand like hellfire.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cA-astral energy!\u201dFacing the astral energy, which was pressuring the space itself, it was impossible to defend against it without using astral energy in return.The color on Runaan, Martha, and Burren\u2019s faces turned from hope to despair.\u201cThis is the end!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon burst out in laughter, full of excitement, and thrust his fist. Astral energy the size of a boulder was falling down on them, and the children\u2019s eyes were filled with darkness.\u2018How about you?\u2019He glanced at the blond-haired boy in order to enjoy his despairing eyes for the last time.However.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon\u2019s eyes widened. He couldn\u2019t see neither despair nor hope in Raon\u2019s eyes.Serene eyes. They were simply filled with murderous intent, intent to slay his enemy.Roar!A tremendous amount of murderous intent covered Raon\u2019s blade.\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been waiting for this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe was already aware of it.He knew the Blood Raving Demon had already reached the master level, that he was strong against fire attributes, and that he had a dirty personality\u2014one that enjoyed playing with his prey before killing it.Since he was already aware of all of that, he had decided to use his trap to his advantage.It was the only way to win\u2014or rather, to survive.Whir!The moment the Blood Raving Demon showed his true nature, the weight of the atmosphere became different.It was a feeling of a lump of steel pressing upon his entire body. Raon grit his teeth and brought up every ounce of murderous intent that the assassin Raon possessed.Clang!The moment his murderous intent started competing with the madness, Burren, Runaan, and Martha\u2014who were at a lower level\u2014were bounced out.That was also according to plan.However, the most important thing still remained.After making them escape the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s astral energy, he twisted his body so suddenly that his waist seemed to snap.Slaaam!A huge fist, surrounded by astral energy, grazed his left shoulder.Crack!It wasn\u2019t a direct hit. Even though it had only brushed past him, the bone on his left arm was crushed.\u201cKueh!\u201dRaon grit his teeth to the breaking point. He endured the pain with a superhuman perseverance and brandished his sword with his right arm.Whir!He gathered all his energy and murderous intent at the end of his sword.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dHe thrust the blade of frost towards the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s heart as the man glared at him in surprise.\u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation Ultimate Point\u2019.The principles of the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 flowed out through the \u2018Coldness of the Frost\u2019. The silver blade was dyed in blue, as if the ice dragon strolling in the sky dwelled within it.Creak!The sound of the blue blade piercing the ogre\u2019s armor resounded in his ears.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHowever, Raon\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t grow any brighter. They only got darker, like the glow of the setting sun.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dBecause the ultimate technique that would even pierce the steel was unable to penetrate any further, blocked by the leather.\u201cHaa\u2026 Amazing.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon coughed out his admiration, a sword piercing his chest.\u201cI never expected you to use my trap instead. I really almost died right there. However\u2026\u201dThe blue sword piercing his chest shattered with a clank.\u201cKeuh!\u201dRaon was sent flying, coughing up blood.\u201cYou were too weak. The difference in power between us isn\u2019t something you can make up for with that kind of surprise attack.\u201dThe blade thrust into the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s chest came out like a pebble stuck in the mud.\u2018His muscles stopped it\u2026\u2019Raon bit his blood-stained lip. The Blood Raving Demon had stopped his attack by enhancing his skin and muscles.It was a method befitting a monster that had reached the level of a master, one that could control his entire body as he wanted.\u201cGasp!\u201dRaon stepped backwards and looked at Burren, Runaan, Martha, and the other remaining trainees.\u201cTh-the plan is over. Run, everyone!\u201d\u201cR-Raon?\u201d\u201cHey, you\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t win.\u201dThere was no way they could win, no matter what they did in their current state. Since the plan had failed, the fight was over. All that was left to do was run away.\u201cI command you as the top trainee. Run away with the villagers! The house\u2019s reinforcement that Krein requested is coming. Run to the west!\u201d\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019ll also\u2026\u201d\u201cBurren Zieghart!\u201dRaon shouted Burren\u2019s name, who was about to stand up with trembling lips.\u201cIs dying in vain right here the Zieghart\u2019s way you told me about before? If that\u2019s the case, then fight alongside me here. If not, then do what you must!\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026\u201dBurren bit his lip. The consideration was long, but the decision was short.\u201cWe\u2019re retreating. Everyone, back off! Focus on running away!\u201dHe ended up tearing his lip, turning around to run towards the village. The trainees shed tears and ran away, following Burren.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaon, who was coughing up blood while grabbing his arm, was reflected in Runaan\u2019s purple eyes.\u201cAaaaaaaah!\u201dAs she was about to dash at the Blood Raving Demon while screaming, Martha struck her neck.With a thud, Runaan lost consciousness and fell on the ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMartha carried her on her back and looked at Raon. She was asking him if there really was no way.Thud!As soon as Raon nodded, she turned around and ran in the direction Burren went.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dRaon smiled faintly. He was glad they were able to understand.Wham!The Blood Raving Demon pulled the sword stuck on his chest out completely. Blood was flowing out, but it soon stopped and the wound started to close. It was the effect of ogre\u2019s stamina and regeneration.\u2018Damn it.\u2019Raon bit his lip. The Bleeding Curse was in effect, but it was completely pointless in that situation. Ten percent was far from enough to allow him to win as he wouldn\u2019t be able to win with a 50% weakening effect.\u201cDo you think those insects can run away?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon crushed the sword in his hand like a biscuit.\u201cI\u2019ve unleashed ogres in the area. They are going to be eaten alive soon enough. No, before that\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon giggled and looked down at Raon.\u201cDo you think you can hold on? With that arm and that stamina?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRaon didn\u2019t respond. He wasn\u2019t looking at the Blood Raving Demon. He was looking at Wrath, who was in his arm.\u2018Wrath.\u2019It\u2019s finally the King of Essence\u2019s turn.Wrath squirmed up like smoke. His pressure alone was far past the Blood Raving Demon, who was at the level of Master.Just like I said before, you can\u2019t win against him with your current strength. Give me your body. I\u2019ll freeze up this entire space, including him.\u2018Haa\u2026 you are always so delusional.\u2019What?\u2018It\u2019s a trade.\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes shone as he coughed up blood.What do you mean, trade?\u2018You mentioned before that I could make trades with your wrath. I\u2019m going to accept your wrath, so return my body and aura to a normal state.\u2019You\u2026Blue coldness burst from Wrath like a flame pillar.You idiot! You\u2019ll never be able to beat him at your current strength, even if you were reborn! You won\u2019t be able to win just from recovering your wounds!\u2018That\u2019s my business. Do you accept or not?\u2019Keuh\u2026Facing Raon\u2019s determination, Wrath ground his teeth, delaying his answer.\u2026Fine. I\u2019ll give you 10 points of wrath and recover your body perfectly. However, you aren\u2019t going to achieve anything with it.\u2018Shut up and give it to me already.\u2019Hmph!After Wrath\u2019s snorting sound, his coldness was absorbed into Raon\u2019s body.\u201cHuff!\u201dHe grit his teeth, feeling the pain of his skin getting ripped apart by the coldness.Creak!The broken arm and ribs were fixed on their own. Raon\u2019s lips trembled at a pain worse than when they broke.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dTears dripped from his eyes before he knew it. It was one of the worst pains he had experienced in both his previous and current lives combined.\u201cWhat are you?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon stood still, eyes widening upon witnessing his arm restoring itself.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon gasped for breath. Even the aura filling up his empty energy center felt painful.However, the true pain didn\u2019t end there.[10 points of wrath have been created according to the contract with \u2018Wrath\u2019.]His lungs shrunk like dry wood and his heart tightened. Every single one of his cells felt like they were being stabbed by a needle.\u201cUaaa\u2026\u201dThe pain was one thing, but he felt like his body was being dislocated from his soul. It was the feeling of something sticky and evil pervading his body.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019His recovery was perfect. He was mentally exhausted, but his body and aura had recovered into a state better than normal.\u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon rolled his curious yellow eyes.\u201cI doubt you drank an ogre or a troll\u2019s blood. How are you able to regenerate so quickly? It\u2019s irrational\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t understand it.\u201dHow painful it was.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dBreathing our hot air, he took another trainee\u2019s sword from the ground.\u2018Wrath.\u2019What is it, you arrogant brat.\u2018Since I might die, let\u2019s make a bet.\u2019Bet?\u2018Yes. I\u2019m going to bet that he is going to die.\u2019You are spouting nonsense once again.\u2018Why, are you afraid?\u2019Fine! Bring it on! The King of Essence is going to bet you are going to hand over your body.After hearing Wrath\u2019s response, Raon pointed his sword at the Blood Raving Demon.\u201cCome at me. I\u2019ll play with you until the sun rises.\u201d***\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dMartha ran after Burren and the other trainees, carrying Runaan on her back.Since everyone was running as fast as they could, they quickly managed to catch up to the other trainees and the villagers.\u201cWh-what happened?\u201d\u201cAre we going to be okay?\u201dThe villagers were walking and running quickly to their standards, but they were way too slow in Martha\u2019s eyes.It was something that couldn\u2019t be helped, but she became irritated.\u201cDamn it, damn\u2026\u201dBurren\u2019s fist trembled and his eyes shook. He just kept walking blankly, without looking ahead or around.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cSir Raon\u2026\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just him. The other trainees\u2019 eyes had also lost focus, as if their souls were drained away.\u201cThat guy\u2026\u201dWhen small swear words and breathing sounds were the only things that could be heard, Martha silently started speaking.\u201cHe stood alone in front of that huge monster in order to protect us and those people.\u201dHearing her voice, filled with desperation and anger, everyone looked back at her.\u201cHe is still stopping him, despite his broken arm and crushed ribs. But what are you doing right now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAfter not having done anything there, are you planning to die like idiots here without doing anything once again?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Sir Burren is also suff\u2026\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dBurren stopped the collateral that was standing in front of Martha.\u201cShe is correct. We have no time to be like this. The first group, watch the front! The second and the third group, watch the left and right side respectively. Control your aura at all times and stay ready to act!\u201dHearing his quick commands, the trainees that were standing blankly started moving to their posts.\u201cMartha, since you have the best perception among us, you are in charge of the back. Give Runaan to us.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dMartha frowned but nodded and handed over the unconscious Runaan to the collateral trainees.\u201cWe are going to increase our speed! Since the house\u2019s reinforcement must be coming, as quickly as possible\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dMartha stopped Burren from speaking, turning her head towards the dense forest on the right side. Burren and the others also followed her gaze in a daze.Swoosh!It sounded like a strong wind rustling through the forest. It was a sound of wind that could\u2019ve been overlooked, but Martha broke out in a cold sweat and drew her sword.\u201cE-everyone retreat! Run away, right no\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, the forest collapsed and a green monster over four meters tall appeared.Ogre.The brutal monster called the tyrant of the mountain stood with shining red eyes.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMartha swallowed.\u2018I didn\u2019t think about it.\u2019The Blood Raving Demon was a monster possessing an ogre\u2019s strength, capable of controlling ogres. It was only natural that ogres existed in that place.\u2018W-we can\u2019t win\u2026\u2019Maybe they could have if they were at their perfect state, but it was impossible to kill the ogre even if everyone fought together the way they were right now. They were really going to be annihilated at that rate.\u201cKuaaaah!\u201dOgre roared and hammered down his huge fist.\u201cHaaap!\u201d\u201cHaa!\u201dMartha and Burren jumped at it, swinging their aura-filled swords.\u201cKrr!\u201dThe ogre withdrew slightly, noticing the aura in their swords.Whoosh!Once their strength ran out after slashing the air, the ogre ran back to them and thrust its fist.Slam!Powerful energy exploded, and Martha and Burren got pushed back, unable to keep their balance.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThey stood back up while staggering, but they were already weakened significantly.\u201cD-damn it\u2026\u201dMartha bit her lip. The ogre had an even more monstrous hunting instinct, to be able to withdraw its body at that instant.\u201cKrr.\u201dThe ogre was approaching them, a small amount of blood flowing down its hand. Its mouth was outright laughing at them.\u201cYou guys leave first! I\u2019ll follow you after killing this one with Martha!\u201dBurren shouted, grabbing his trembling right wrist with his left hand. His turn had come.\u201cS-Sir Burren!\u201d\u201cQuickly!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dDorian grit his teeth and turned around. However, another sound was heard before he started moving.Slam!Along with a thunderous noise crushing the ground, an enormous shadow appeared from the left side.A second ogre blocked the trainees\u2019 path.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMartha\u2019s eyes wavered violently.\u2018This was why.\u2019That was the reason the Blood Raving Demon was smiling despite them running away. He had already released the ogres in the area.\u201cE-everything\u2019s over.\u201dThe atmosphere became even more quiet, following somebody\u2019s despair-filled voice.\u201cKrrr!\u201d\u201cKwaaa!\u201dThe only sounds that could be heard now were the ogre\u2019s hungry roar and the human\u2019s scared groans.\u201cDon\u2019t back down.\u201dBurren brandished his sword, wiping the blood flowing from his mouth.\u201cRaon is also still fighting! If we die here, we will be too ashamed to face the one that is still fighting the Blood Raving Demon on his own!\u201dHe screamed and drew out his aura. The blue wind raged, strengthened by his determination.\u201cYou\u2019re talking sense for once.\u201dMartha chuckled and nodded, surrounding her sword with Titan\u2019s aura.\u201cI have to go help Raon.\u201dRunaan\u2014who had woken up\u2014brandished her sword, radiating silver frost.It was a desperate situation, yet darkness couldn\u2019t be found in three people\u2019s eyes.\u201cKrr!\u201d\u201cKwaaa!\u201dIt seemed the two ogres didn\u2019t like such expressions on their prey, as they roared and kicked the ground.The moment the three swordsmen and two monsters clashed against each other.Whoosh!Green wind raged from the center of the forest.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Slam!The yellow aura pressed and burst the blue and red aura.Whoosh!Raon was sent back flying through the jet-black smoke.Creak!He barely managed to stop after sticking his sword in the ground.\u201cHaak!\u201dRaon\u2019s chin trembled, vomiting out the black, dead blood. His repaired left arm was crushed once again, and his side was ripped apart.He could hardly breathe because of the pain filling his entire body.\u201cYou are like a leech.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon approached him, while warming up his solid finger. His increasingly powerful energy wave was bursting Raon\u2019s skin.Baam!He crushed the ground and leaped at him like a cannonball.\u201cHuff!\u201dRaon kicked the ground and rotated his body.Tick!After dodging the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist with a paper-thin difference, he stepped back.\u201cTsk.\u201dHe clicked his tongue. His broken and swaying left arm was bothering him. If it accidentally got caught, he could be killed right after.\u2018Shall I cut it off?\u2019He considered cutting off his left arm, since that would allow him to hold on for a little bit longer.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u2018Why am I doing this here?\u2019\u2018My arm has been shattered twice, my side got ripped apart, and my muscles and skin are screaming.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m fighting against that monster, enduring pain that I didn\u2019t even experience in my previous life.\u2019Various memories passed by his mind, from the moment of his birth until now.\u2018I remembered the words of the person I spent the longest time with, the one I felt the most uncomfortable with, and the one I wanted to apologize to the most.\u2019[I want Raon to become like those ancient swordsmen of Zieghart.]Right. Those was the words\u2018Those words from Sylvia are binding me here.\u2019\u2018If this were my previous life, I would\u2019ve run away already.\u2019\u2018I would\u2019ve run away from the monster, even if that meant using Burren, Runaan, Martha, and the trainees\u2014even the villagers\u2014as bait.\u2019\u2018But what Sylvia said\u2026\u2019\u2018The memories of the trainees that spent time with me are binding me to this place.\u2019\u2018Runaan looks cold and blank, but she\u2019s nicer than anyone. She\u2019s a girl that has endured pain by herself in order to save her family from a psychopathic brother.\u2019\u2018Burren was a rude guy, but he changed quickly like a good child and has started running towards his goal.\u2019\u2018Martha is rough, but she has a strong willpower and unwavering conviction. I\u2019m not certain, but she seems to miss her birth mother.\u2019\u2018The other trainees also changed gradually, despite the beginning. It would be a lie if I said I wasn\u2019t attached to them.\u2019\u2018Everything changed a lot.\u2019\u2018The way they look at me has changed a lot, and the way I look at them has also changed.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s why I decided to stay.\u2019\u2018Just like Sylvia had said, I wanted to save those that are growing up as Zieghart swordsmen.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s different from when I used to participate in dozens of battlefields, killing hundreds of lives in my previous life.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m currently fighting against this monster of my own volition.\u2019\u201cHa!\u201dHe burst into laughter.He felt strange, wielding his sword in order to save people instead of killing them.\u201cAre you laughing in this situation? You aren\u2019t normal, either.\u201d\u201cI know, right? I didn\u2019t think I would be like this.\u201dRaon nodded. As he was standing in that posture, Wrath\u2014who had been watching him\u2014silently came up with a distorted conclusion.I finally understand it.\u2018What?\u2019You are planning to give your body to the King of Essence.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019You are just buying time right now until those young ones escape the King of Essence\u2019s range.\u2018So, you finally noticed.\u2019Such arrogance from a madman!Wrath\u2019s flame shot up like a star in the night sky. The wrath was more intense than it ever had been.Raon Zieghart. There\u2019s a limit in how much you can underestimate the King of Essence. Do you truly believe you can regain the control of your body in the short time between I kill him and find your allies?\u2018I\u2019m not certain. It\u2019s just a gamble.\u2019Raon shook his head.\u2018Since that\u2019s the only way.\u2019There was no way he could win against the Blood Raving Demon currently, and reinforcements were going to take at least a few hours.The only way to survive and save everyone was to hand over his body to Wrath to kill him, then regain the body before he reached the trainees.You\u2019ve already accepted the King of Essence\u2019s wrath. It will be different from before.\u2018But I still have to try.\u2019He couldn\u2019t die in vain like that, with his archenemy still alive.Stop your mistakes. You are currently exhausted both mentally and physically. Your emotions are also agitated. I\u2019ll let you experience it.Wrath ground his teeth and stuck on Raon\u2019s body.\u201cKuaaah!\u201dRaon screamed, unable to withstand it. The pain was at a different level from before, dying his skin in black.\u201cWh-what\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s your current state. You might be able to stop the King of Essence\u2019s possession, but you will never be able to come back once you hand over your body by yourself.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon trembled. Wrath was correct, he wasn\u2019t confident he could endure the pain and shock just now.\u2018Then how\u2026\u2019\u201cIt looks like you finally have a problem. Ah! I got a great idea.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon spun his bulky finger.\u201cI should kill your allies before killing you. What kind of face are you going to make if I pluck off their heads, one by one?\u201dHe turned around while giggling. His thigh puffed up, as he was about to split the ground and run off.\u2018No.\u2019The trainees wouldn\u2019t withstand a single strike from the Blood Raving Demon. It would be a massacre. Holding out so far would become meaningless then.That was one thing he couldn\u2019t allow.\u201cStop.\u201dRaon brandished his broken sword. He grit his teeth and straightened his spine. Using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019 to the extreme, he increased his prowess.\u201cLook at me.\u201dHe pointed his broken sword at the Blood Raving Demon. His hand was trembling, but the tip of his sword wasn\u2019t wavering.\u201cMy name is Raon Zieghart. I\u2019m the Destructive King of the North, Glenn Zieghart\u2019s, grandson\u2014and the swordsman that will become the continent\u2019s strongest one day.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter whether Glenn acknowledged him or not. It was fine even if the others didn\u2019t accept him as one of their own.\u201cI\u2019m still alive. You won\u2019t leave this place until my heart stops beating! O, =mad demon of Eden!\u201dHis prowess and aura, which were completely exhausted, ignited once again and surrounded his blade.\u201cHah!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon\u2019s yellow eyes reflected his admiration.\u201cSuch spirit at that age! Excellent isn\u2019t a sufficient word to describe it. Fine, I shall pay respect befitting to a true warrior.\u201dHis energy soared up explosively. He turned the muscle he had amplified in order to run.\u201cHaaa!\u201dHe managed to turn his attention back to him, but there was nothing more he could do.\u2018What shall I do?\u2019He would die to the Blood Raving Demon if he didn\u2019t give his body to Wrath.If he gave his body to Wrath, the trainees were going to die, and he was probably going to be unable to recover his body for eternity.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Misfortunes on top of misfortunes. There was no solution.The Blood Raving Demon was right under his nose. His leg wouldn\u2019t move after exhausting his strength to increase his prowess and aura.\u201cI\u2019ll remember your name, Raon Zieghart.\u201dRaon was unable to decide until the moment he was about to strike with his boulder-like fist.\u2018Still!\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t die like this. I still have something to do!\u2019\u2018Wrath, I\u2019ll give my body to \u2026\u2019You\u2019ve finally decided. It\u2019s time to say goodbye.Wrath\u2019s voice was filled with anticipation and a small, unknown emotion.\u2018Yo\u2026\u2019In the middle of talking, Raon widened. The kind and refreshing fragrance of the wind, one that he had scented countless times after he turned twelve years old, brushed past his nose.What are you doing?! Make up your mind already!\u2018I\u2019m not giving it to you.\u2019Damn it! Why now, of all times!He lowered his sword as he heard Wrath\u2019s scream. He even closed his eyes.\u201cDie!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon struck with his fist. Raon\u2019s skin burst from the wind pressure, but he didn\u2019t open his eyes.Whoosh.There was no pain. He opened his eyes, hearing the sound of a small wind gently touching a flower petal.He could see long red hair fluttering in the wind and a broad back, surrounded by green wind.The thin sword he was holding was perfectly defending against the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dRaon wrinkled his mouth, looking at the man in front of him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I overslept a little.\u201dThe red-haired swordsman, Rimmer, turned around. He smiled with a face covered in someone\u2019s blood.\u201cLeave the rest to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Raon was a gemstone that had all the talents required for a swordsman.Rimmer calmed his excitement and watched Eden\u2019s movement.Despite his expectations, Eden didn\u2019t attack the trainees. Instead, they threw some monsters at them so they could gain some accomplishments and leave.\u2018They are hiding something.\u2019It didn\u2019t seem like they feared the instructor protecting the children. Instead, they seemed to be aiming for something in the area, and they were avoiding attacking the children because of that.They were afraid of Zieghart reinforcements.It seemed he needed to thoroughly search the area after the children left.Raon didn\u2019t make his move, despite having noticed somebody was observing them. He left the village after accepting the villagers\u2019 thanks as one of the normal trainees that killed the monsters.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019Was he retreating?That wasn\u2019t a bad choice.Deciding to retreat after noticing the difference between themselves and the enemies was a wise move for a warrior.However, Raon\u2019s actions after that completely differed from Rimmer\u2019s expectation.As soon as the Red Eye Demon left them, Raon revealed the truth to everyone and immediately requested reinforcement from the branch office.After returning to Cebu village, he even guessed that the opponents were Eden after witnessing the monsters attacking the village.Rimmer was amazed upon hearing that.Raon had reached the conclusion that they were Eden, basing his judgment on the observer and the fact that they were using monsters. Raon\u2019s brain was extraordinary, on top of everything else.Raon decided to wait, and Burren and Runaan drew their swords and dashed at the monsters in order to save the village.\u2018That\u2019s what children would do.\u2019The children that were running in order to save people looked like heroes, true Zieghart swordsmen.Without losing to the green demons attacking them, they fought to protect the village.However.They weren\u2019t the ones that caught Rimmer\u2019s attention. Raon was.He started hiding his presence as soon as he noticed that an enemy was hiding, and he didn\u2019t reveal himself until the end.That wasn't the kind of patience that a fifteen-year-old could show.He didn\u2019t look like a swordsman fighting on the frontlines. He looked like a king, looking down on everyone from his throne.\u2018The qualities of a king.\u2019Just as he had felt before, Raon Zieghart possessed the qualities of a king.The fight between the green demon and the children was fierce, and the trainees emerged victorious with Martha\u2019s surprise attack at Raon\u2019s command.However, the situation was reversed with the Green War Demon\u2019s emergence from his hiding spot deep inside the forest.Unable to withstand a single strike from the Green War Demon, the trainees collapsed while coughing up blood.It was only natural.After all, the Green War Demon was a powerful opponent\u2014one at the Expert\u2019s level.Rimmer drew his sword and remained on standby near the children in order to help whenever he needed to.\u2018Is he still not making his move?\u2019Raon didn\u2019t appear despite Burren, Runaan, and Martha being on the brink of death.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped.\u2019The moment Rimmer decided to act, about to stop the Green War Demon, Raon made his move.With a precise movement, he approached the Green War Demon as stealthily as a shadow to avoid being noticed, swinging his sword at his neck.\u2018Hah\u2026\u2019Rimmer smirked. He didn\u2019t manage to cut off his head, but the strike that sliced the Green War Demon\u2019s arm was a polished killing technique.The Green War Demon kept his advantage in the fight with his powerful combative energy despite having lost his arm, but he ended up dying to Raon\u2019s sword\u2014one that reached a whole new level.\u2018Hahahaha!\u2019Rimmer burst into laughter, unable to hold it back. He was really a monster. Raon Zieghart had the qualities needed to become the strongest swordsman and the supreme ruler of the continent.He needed to protect him and raise him properly at all costs.\u2018He is really limitless.\u2019He laughed and stood up. It was time to do his job.Rimmer got rid of all the Red Eye Demons running away from Cebu Mountain after the Green War Demon\u2019s death. He needed to prevent the information from spreading.He returned after thoroughly checking Cebu village and Cebu Mountain, making sure there was no danger left.Raon had woken up after fainting, and he had grown one level higher thanks to the enlightenment he had obtained during combat. He could probably even use aura blade.\u2018He might even notice me at that point.\u2019Rimmer went a bit further, since he felt like Raon might notice his sloppy concealment.\u2018Maybe I should return.\u2019Since the reinforcements Krein called would arrive in the morning, and there was no more danger left, returning seemed to be a good option.Actually, he wanted to tell Glenn about Raon\u2019s exploits more than anything.\u2018Well, then\u2026\u2019Rimmer returned to the house after checking on the children. As he was headed to Zieghart with light footsteps, a powerful energy exploded from Cebu village.\u2018This energy\u2026\u2019It was an energy he had felt before, and the intensity of the energy wave suggested it was at the level of a Master.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Damn it!\u2019Rimmer ran towards the village at full power. It was a tremendous speed, but he felt like he was as slow as a larva.His chest tightened each time he heard the explosive sounds coming from the village.Runaan, Burren, and Martha came into view as he was running.Noticing two ogres attacking them, he drew his sword.Slice!Using the wind sword, he cut apart the two ogres at once.Rimmer asked for Raon\u2019s location with his eyes before their heads fell on the ground.Runaan pointed at the village with her eyes.She didn\u2019t usually show much emotion, but her eyes were filled with too much.Rimmer grit his teeth and ran into the village.Green demons and monsters attacked him on his way, but he killed them all and made his way to the center.And he couldn\u2019t suppress his astonishment.Raon withstood the attacks of Eden\u2019s monster, the Blood Raving Demon, until the end with such a small and young body.His left arm was broken and dangling, his side was scooped out, and he was dragging his leg\u2014but he was still holding his sword.It was an impressive sight, worthy of admiration.At that very moment, Rimmer was certain.He would follow the boy, no\u2014the young\u00a0king\u2014for the rest of his life and guard him.Whoosh!The sword of his new loyalty blocked the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201dRaon smiled, as if he already knew he was coming.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I overslept a little.\u201dRimmer responded casually.\u201cLeave the rest to me.\u201dAfter saying that, Rimmer pushed back the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist.Wham!The sight of a boulder-like fist being pushed back by a thin sword was a spectacle to behold.\u201cZieghart\u2019s Sword of Light!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Baldy.\u201dDespite facing the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s brutal astral energy, Rimmer didn\u2019t stop smiling. Instead, he waved as if he had met a friend for the first time in a long time.\u201cHow are you here?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let a Baldy like you trample over the cute sprouts.\u201d\u201cZieghart\u2019s gotten a lot softer, sending someone like you to accompany the mission!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon threw his punches left and right, surrounded by red astral energy. A terrifying amount of astral energy rained down on Rimmer.\u201cHaap!\u201dRimmer sword, imbued with green aura, slashed diagonally. The astral energy was deflected to the right, like water following a drain.\u201cYou barely deflected that level of astral energy. It seems the rumors about your energy center breaking, rendering you disabled, were true.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a false rumor. Change your intelligence source already, you and your helmet squad are still late on the updates.\u201d\u201cYour balance is broken, no matter how you look at it.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon grinned. It was just an expression of his emotion, but it felt like the whole atmosphere was trembling.\u201cWhat should we do? You thought he came to your rescue, but he is just a puppy who will get eaten alongside you.\u201dHe laughed at Raon, who was barely standing behind Rimmer.\u201cWhether I\u2019m a puppy or a Cerberus that guards hell, we shall find out!\u201dRimmer struck upward with his sword from the right, creating a powerful wind and cutting through the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s shoulder.Pssh!The Blood Raving Demon\u2019s shoulder started bleeding, but the wound closed instantly\u2014as if time reversed itself.\u201cYour sword used to be extremely vicious. However, that\u2019s not the case anymore.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon kicked the ground, piercing through Rimmer\u2019s wall of wind.\u201cYou\u2019ve become weak. Your sword can\u2019t cut through me!\u201dHe slammed his fist down while saying that.Clang!Unable to take that attack head on, Rimmer spun his sword. The green aura spinning like a windmill became a thick shield, but it couldn\u2019t withstand the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s astral energy.Shatter!The green aura broke apart, and the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist slammed down.However, Rimmer wasn\u2019t there anymore. After throwing the aura shield as a bait, he pierced into the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s left side and swung his sword.Slam!Rimmer\u2019s precise strike was aimed at the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s heart from the bottom.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon roared and crouched, stopping Rimmer\u2019s sword as it was piercing into his ribs.\u201cI became even stronger while you were getting weaker. The difference in power has been completely reversed!\u201d\u201cTsk!\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue and pulled out his sword. Since his sword might break if left alone, it was the right thing to do.\u201cKuhahaha!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon roared and swung his fist. The ground screamed at the even more powerful strikes.\u201cHow unsophisticated.\u201dUnable to face the attacks head on, Rimmer dodged them through footwork.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019Instead of the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s violent strikes, Raon focused on Rimmer\u2019s footwork.\u2018He looks like a leaf riding the wind.\u2019Rimmer was moving as lightly as a flower petal riding the wind, dodging all the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s punches.It looked like the completion of his movement that he had used when he fought against the Blood Raving Demon.Also, the timing of the slashes that he was mixing in between were perfect.If Rimmer had imbued his sword with astral energy, the fight would\u2019ve been over already.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Even though his attacks weren\u2019t effective, Rimmer looked like he had plenty of room to spare. He kept fighting the Blood Raving Demon at a point-blank distance, as if he were showing it to him.\u2018Wait, is he really?\u2019Raon\u2019s eyes widened. He understood Rimmer\u2019s intention from the movement of his eyes.\u2018He is showing it to me.\u2019He was giving him a combat lesson at that very moment. He must\u2019ve been out of his mind.\u201cCan\u2019t you even catch me in my weakened state? Are you sure you aren\u2019t going to lose that helmet?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon thrust his fist, gaze full of madness. Facing a tremendous amount of energy, Rimmer stepped back instead of rashly confronting it.Slam!A single strike collapsed the village and gouged the ground. The power behind it made him look like a legendary giant.\u201cFight me properly, Zieghart\u2019s Sword of Light!\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon instinctively chased Rimmer, letting anger control his body.Slaam!It was a simple movement, but his impressive strength and speed allowed him to close the distance between them.\u201cTsk. I have no choice.\u201dRimmer halted his movement and glanced back. He smiled upon seeing Raon.\u201cSince the teaching material has gone out of control, let\u2019s finish today\u2019s lesson here.\u201d\u201cYou crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cWatch closely, Raon.\u201dRimmer continued before Raon could even respond.\u201cThis is the way Zieghart fights, and the level you will have to reach.\u201dRimmer\u2019s sword pierced the sky, and his left hand pointed at the ground.\u201cSword Field Creation.\u201dHis voice sounded like it was resounding from heavens and surging up from the underworld at the same time.\u201cEye of the Storm.\u201dThe voice resounded like a mantra, changing the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was completely silent, as if air had stopped flowing, and his entire body felt as heavy as if a lump of steel was settled on his shoulders.The Blood Raving Demon seemed confused, standing still with his eyes and mouth wide open. He wasn\u2019t able to move his body freely, either.Whir!A clear flow protruded into that silent space.It was Rimmer\u2019s sword. Dark green wind was gathering on his empty sword, devoid of aura.Thud!Rimmer stomped the ground. His body shot up like an arrow, crushing the ground.The Blood Raving Demon thrust his fist in panic, but Rimmer rode the wind to pierce into him even deeper.And a single slash\u2026The sword containing the wind itself fell vertically.Slice!The Blood Raving Demon\u2019s right hand was harder than steel, yet it was easily cut off. It fell onto the pitch-black ground.However, the Blood Raving Demon was a warrior at a Master\u2019s level. Losing his arm wasn\u2019t enough to make him fall.He immediately stopped the bleeding of his right arm and stepped back. His movement was as swift and flexible as a tiger.Rimmer turned his sword to follow the Blood Raving Demon, as if he were already expecting it.The Blood Raving Demon tried escaping from Rimmer\u2019s Eye of the Storm, but the space was moving along with Rimmer.Upon realizing he couldn\u2019t escape, the Blood Raving Demon came to a halt. Lowering his posture, he focused all his remaining energy in his left fist.Whir!The space was vibrating. Red astral energy appeared as a stream, creating a tidal wave.Rimmer faced the tidal wave of astral energy covering the ground, holding a single thin sword.Whoosh!The Eye of the Storm grew bigger in size, and the wind surrounding Rimmer\u2019s sword grew lighter in color.Rimmer swung his sword, the blade surrounded by the storm.Crack!With a cliff-splitting sound, the dark green wind cut through the red tidal wave.Whoosh!An intense light burst out at that moment.\u2018Keuh!\u2019Even Raon closed his eyes for a moment, unable to withstand the light.\u2018Is it over?\u2019When he opened his eyes, the Eye of the Storm had disappeared, and the world had returned to normal.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon and Rimmer were facing each other, about five steps apart.\u201cYou cut your strength of body and aura in half and incorporated all the wind around that windless space in your sword.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon\u2019s voice was still overflowing with madness and combative energy.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, since Sword Field is that kind of technique. But how were you able to use a Sword Field?\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon wasn\u2019t the only one curious about it. Raon was also surprised at seeing Rimmer using a Sword Field.\u2018I thought those who inherited Zieghart\u2019s blood were the only ones capable of using a Sword Field\u2026\u2019As the strongest organizations in the continent, Six Kings and Five Demons had distinct characteristics, but Zieghart was special even among them.They were capable of creating a barrier as swordsmen, and not as mages. That was why the Sword Field Creation was an outstanding ability, renowned throughout the continent.However, those who could use it were limited to those who had inherited Zieghart\u2019s blood, and only a small number among them were actually capable of using it.Because of that, it didn\u2019t make sense that Rimmer was able to use it\u2014not when he wasn\u2019t even human.\u201cMore specifically, it\u2019s not exactly a Sword Field, but something similar.\u201dRimmer smiled while closing his eyes.\u201cSince I\u2019m pretty close to nature because I\u2019m an elf.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon nodded, realizing something.\u201cAn injured tiger who lost their teeth is still a tiger, huh.\u201dLetting out a laugh, he looked at Raon.\u201cWhat a shame. I should\u2019ve gotten rid of him at all costs, since he is going to impact Eden gravely\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let our young king be defeated by someone like you.\u201d\u201cCertainly, he has the qualities of a supreme ruler instead of an average swordsman. However, don\u2019t be arrogant.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon\u2019s voice started to tremble.\u201cWe also have a talent as good as him in our side. I\u2019m looking forward to you fighting against him.\u201d\u201cThe continent is vast, after all.\u201dRimmer murmured that it was understandable and nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s my loss, Zieghart\u2019s Sword of Light.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon closed his eyes after saying that. A red line appeared from the center of his body.The body, maintained through aura, split apart. The giant at the Master\u2019s level fell back.Whir!The Blood Raving Demon\u2019s helmet was also split in half, and the light of madness disappeared.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRimmer sighed and sat on the ground.\u201cWere you watching?\u201dHe turned his head around and grinned. He looked exhausted despite having his usual expression on his face.\u201cYes, I was.\u201dRaon nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s the special technique you should learn as a Zieghart. It\u2019s called the Sword Field.\u201d\u201cSword Field\u2026\u201dHe murmured the words \u2018Sword Field\u2019, pretending he didn\u2019t know about it.\u201cIt\u2019s a barrier created through pressure and karma, not mana like a magician would use.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve put so much importance on pressure.\u201d\u201cYes. Even if you aren\u2019t using a Sword Field, developing pressure helps you exert your power.\u201dRimmer grinned, and Raon nodded once again.\u2018Certainly\u2026\u2019He might have been a bit different, but Rimmer\u2019s training requiring trainees to surpass their limits every day must\u2019ve greatly helped the other children.If they hadn\u2019t gone through the training to increase their pressure, the children wouldn\u2019t have been able to fight against the Green War Demon, nor run away from the Blood Raving Demon.\u201cYou are a collateral, but you are actually a member of the direct line. You can probably use it one day\u2026 No, you will certainly use it.\u201dRimmer declared, certain that he could do it one day.\u201cThe experience, achievement, aura, and even the future you\u2019ve been accumulating. Sword Field is created by incorporating all of that. You need to experience many things, and you must learn.\u201dHe was teaching him despite being out of breath. Everything from the battle against the Blood Raving Demon until that moment was a lesson.\u201cYou guys watched too, right?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Rimmer completely turned his body and looked far away.

He\u2019s alive!\u201dThe hand Martha used to grab Raon\u2019s shoulder trembled, unable to believe Raon had managed to survive so long.\u201cSir Raon!\u201d\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cKeuh!\u201dDorian and the trainees came running at him with teary eyes.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dBurren\u2019s chin trembled as he breathed out a sigh of relief.\u201cI\u2019m really glad\u2026\u201dWhile faltering, he sniffed and turned his gaze to Rimmer, who was next to Raon.\u201cBy the way, instructor.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHow was the instructor able to use the Sword Field Creation?\u201d\u201cI made it.\u201d\u201cD-did you say you made it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRimmer repeated what he told the Blood Raving Demon and nodded his head.\u201cThere are a few different kinds of Sword Fields that are passed down in Zieghart. Since they are inherited through blood, only their bloodline can use it\u2014but making a new one is a different story.\u201dHe smiled, telling him that he made the Sword Field.\u201cThen am I also able to use that Sword Field?\u201dMartha asked while stepping forward. Runaan\u2019s eyes were also glittering.\u201cThat\u2019s a no.\u201dRimmer calmly shook his head.\u201cThere are two conditions that are requirements for a non-Zieghart to create a Sword Field.\u201d\u201cTwo conditions?\u201d\u201cFirst is experience. You need to have lots of experience with a Sword Field. I\u2019ve done that in all the battlefields I\u2019ve led with the Lord. And second is\u2026\u201dHe gave a look at each trainee before he continued.\u201cThe talent in attribute.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of talent are you talking about?\u201dMartha took one step closer and asked. She was greatly interested in the Sword Field.\u201cTalent in attributes. The power of attribute is necessary for people like us, who don\u2019t have Zieghart\u2019s blood, to create the Sword Field. I\u2019ve managed to make it through the power of wind.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201dRimmer shook his head with a dejected expression.\u201cCollaterals and a few vassal families, including the Sullion families, also inherited Zieghart\u2019s blood. They might be able to use the Sword Field if they worked hard on it. However, you would need to sacrifice something if you are trying to use the Sword Field without Zieghart\u2019s blood.\u201d\u201cSacrifice?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRimmer didn\u2019t respond.\u201cYou have a bright future ahead of you. Unlike me, who had no choice but to make my Sword Field, you should be able to get stronger with your own strength.\u201dHe included wind in his voice, so that everyone could hear him.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this later, and for now\u2026\u201dRimmer took out a transparent water bottle from his sleeve and approached Raon.\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt. Endure it.\u201dHe spoke as he poured the water on his broken arm and his torn waist and thigh.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was extremely painful, but Raon didn\u2019t groan in the slightest. That much couldn\u2019t even be called a pain compared to when he was fighting against the Blood Raving Demon.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d\u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u201cBut you aren\u2019t even groaning.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt\u00a0that\u00a0much.\u201d\u201cHuh, wow.\u201dRimmer snickered and shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s over, so let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dBurren raised his hand. He had the same eyes as when he was in the training ground.\u201cI have a question.\u201d\u201cEek? I\u2019m tired, can we do it later\u2026\u201dRimmer gulped, guessing what he was about to ask.\u201cNo, I need to ask it right now. Where have you even been, that you came out to help so late? It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve been following us, so why did you appear after we were in so much danger? Not only us, but the villagers were also in dan\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that?\u201dRimmer raised his finger and pointed towards Burren\u2019s back.\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cWhat is it again\u2026\u201dThe trainees hurriedly looked back, but all they could see were shaking branches without any leaves.\u201cThere\u2019s no\u2026 Where did he go?\u201dBurren\u2019s eyes widened. Rimmer had disappeared in the short time he was looking away.\u201cThat guy, seriously! Why did he appear so late?! We almost died for real!\u201dHe was grateful that he came to save them, but the timing was too dramatic. Considering the villagers' lives were also at stake, he should\u2019ve appeared earlier.\u201cDid anyone die?\u201dRaon walked up to Burren, grabbing his broken right arm.\u201cFortunately, nobody died. I would\u2019ve grabbed the instructor by the collar if there was any.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s fine.\u201dRimmer must\u2019ve had his own circumstances. The villagers must\u2019ve been shocked, but they should be able to overcome it since no one had died.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s clean up. We still have much to do.\u201dRaon shook his head, his entire body covered in blood.\u201cA-are you really okay?\u201d\u201cAre you okay, Raon?\u201dBurren and Runaan asked at once.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dRaon nodded like nothing, despite being seriously injured no matter how one looked at him.Raon was recovering his body and mana circuit with the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.Rimmer\u2019s medicine was also effective, so his body and mana circuit became even stronger after a good rest.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dBurren lowered his head. His drooping hand was trembling.\u201cYou had to step up because my decision was made too late, yet I almost got everyone killed. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fit to lead anyone.\u201d\u201cYou look like you are about to die from a single mistake. If you realized your problem, develop your decision-making and strength together.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cOr you could just give up on everything if you aren\u2019t confident.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m going to gain judgment and strength that won\u2019t lose in any situation! I promise this to you, the one that saved my life!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dRaon waved his uninjured left hand.\u2018I would\u2019ve punched him if he apologized for being unable to help me.\u2019He liked that he apologized for not running away immediately, instead of not fighting against the Blood Raving Demon together.Since Burren was still a child, he would be able to improve a lot more in the future.\u201cRunaan, you\u2019re the same. You should\u2019ve run away back then instead of trying to help me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201dRunaan shook her head with an unusually sullen face.\u201cIf it\u2019s an opponent you can\u2019t win against\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201d\u201cNo, listen to me first.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t listen. I\u2019m going to help.\u201dShe covered her ears and shook her head while saying that.\u201cI\u2019m going to get stronger. I\u2019m definitely going to get stronger and fight alongside you!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe silliness drew a bitter smile from him. However, his heart felt warm. He could feel the sincerity in her words when she said she would get stronger and help him.It was a difficult mission, one where he got injured a lot, but he was happy that he got to learn a lot about emotions.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon looked at Martha. She seemed to be thinking about something, her deep gaze was directed at him.\u201cIt\u2019s over. Let\u2019s return.\u201dHe waved his hand at the trainees, who were still standing around dumbfounded.He could see people running at them from the darkness. They were the Zieghart reinforcements that Krein went to call.His mind grew relaxed because everything was really over.[You\u2019ve won the bet against \u2018Wrath\u2019.][The reward is being distributed.]When he was thinking he wanted to rest, a blue window appeared in front of his eyes.\u201cHuh?\u201dHuh??Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It wasn\u2019t strange for him to have changed only towards Raon.\u2018Runaan has also changed.\u2019The expressionless girl with faint emotion was now talking and expressing herself clearly. That change was also going to greatly affect her swordsmanship.\u2018And Martha.\u2019Her eyes were also visibly different. She seemed to be deeply moved from watching Raon\u2019s fight and righteous spirit.\u2018She must be interested in the Sword Field in order to catch up to Raon.\u2019The reason that she was interested in the Sword Field must\u2019ve been to either to catch up to Raon, or to stand by his side.Checking on every trainee, Rimmer could feel that they had all grown up in terms of power and mentality.He felt proud of them, and ashamed at the same time\u2014ashamed that he couldn\u2019t arrive in time to save them.\u201cWell, then\u2026 ugh!\u201dAs he was about to follow the trainees, he felt a pain in his lower abdomen.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dIt was the price for straining his broken energy center and even opening the Sword Field. It felt like his life itself had grown shorter.\u2018My lifespan must\u2019ve decreased.\u2019He avoided telling the trainees about it, but lifespan needed to be offered in order to open a Sword Field without being a Zieghart.Since he wasn\u2019t neither young nor healthy, his lifespan must\u2019ve decreased drastically.\u2018I have no regrets, though.\u2019He had already lived long enough.Ever since his energy center was broken, he couldn\u2019t feel any fulfillment in his life.Since he felt like he had found a new life ever since he started teaching those children, he didn\u2019t regret offering his lifespan in the slightest.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRimmer stood up after waiting for the pain in his heart and energy center subsided.He could see the villagers bowing at Raon.\u201cStill, I need to live to see the day he becomes the head.\u201dHe giggled on his own, disappearing from his spot like the wind.***Zieghart\u2019s South-West branch office was in charge of Cebu village and Cebu Mountain\u2019s protection.\u201cTsk.\u201dZieghart\u2019s South-West branch office manager, Brukas, clicked his tongue while heading towards Cebu village.\u2018Did he mention Eden?\u2019A trainee named Krein came up to him and told him Eden had appeared in Cebu village.Apparently Raon Zieghart noticed the Red Eye Demon\u2019s observation, but that sounded like bullshit to him.In order to notice a Red Eye Demon\u2019s gaze, one needed to be at least an intermediate Expert.It didn\u2019t make any sense that Raon, who was only fifteen years old, would notice.\u201cBranch manager, do we really need to go when it doesn\u2019t even make any sense? We\u2019ve already investigated it, you know.\u201dThe branch\u2019s vice-manager, Serviane, came next to him and complained. He seemed to be complaining since he was the one who investigated Cebu village and Cebu Mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s not because of Raon. It\u2019s because Burren, Runaan, and Martha are over there. If something happens to those three, our entire branch office might be executed.\u201d\u201cAww, that sounds awful.\u201d\u201cManage your expression. You have to\u2026 Huh?\u201dBrukas\u2019s eyes widened upon seeing the blood on the road towards the village. Upon following the stream of blood flowing like a river, a huge green body came into view.\u201cO-ogre?\u201dA round and brutal face. A body and limbs as thick as several logs piled up together. It was an ogre\u2019s corpse, the tyrant of the mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s an ogre!\u201d\u201cWh-why is an ogre here?\u201d\u201cMoreover, there are two of them\u2026\u201dThe branch\u2019s swordsmen swallowed, standing in front of the ogres\u2019 corpses.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBrukas frowned after examining the ogres\u2019 corpses. What killed them was a single strike hitting their weak point, a master\u2019s attack.\u2018I don\u2019t know about Eden, but something happened for sure.\u2019People\u2019s blood and clothes could also be found on top of the ogres\u2019 corpses and blood.\u201cStay on red alert.\u201dThe light in Brukas\u2019s eyes changed. He immediately started running towards the village, and the branch\u2019s swordsmen also followed him with serious expressions.Finding the village\u2019s entrance, which looked like it was crushed by a passing giant, they increased the speed even further. When they were about to cross the center of the village, the trainees appeared in front of them.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dBrukas couldn\u2019t finish his sentence upon seeing the trainee standing at the front.\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019Raon Zieghart.The frail-looking boy\u2019s left arm was limp like a rag, and holes as big as a fist could be seen on his waist and his thigh.However, the boy wasn\u2019t even groaning despite his severe injuries, and his eyes were as clear as a night lake.A powerful pressure could be felt, despite his wounded state.It was a feeling of facing an old swordsman with lots of expertise, through countless accomplishments.\u201cI\u2019m the fifth training ground\u2019s top trainee, Raon Zieghart.\u201dRaon politely greeted him.\u201cAh, y-yes. What exactly happened here? Did Eden really appear?\u201dBrukas stuttered, flustered by Raon\u2019s pure energy.\u201cIndeed.\u201dAfter saying that, he threw two helmets under his feet.They were the Green War Demon\u2019s helmet, with an orc fighter\u2019s drawing on it, and the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s helmet, with an Ogre\u2019s head drawn on it.\u201cB-Blood Raving Demon and Green War Demon? D-did Eden really appear?\u201d\u201cWe were the ones who killed the Green War Demon, but it was the instructor who killed the Blood Raving Demon.\u201d\u201cInstructor?\u201d\u201cIt was Instructor Rimmer.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSince the Blood Raving Demon was a warrior at a Master\u2019s level, he was surprised to hear that Rimmer had killed him with his broken energy center.\u201cHe is really amaz\u2026 Ah, wait!\u201dBrukas dropped his jaw. He finally understood something more surprising than Rimmer killing the Blood Raving Demon.\u201cY-you guys killed the Green War Demon?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cYes.\u201dRaon plainly nodded.\u201cH-how? How could you have killed the Green War Demon?\u201dRimmer killing the Blood Raving Demon was surprising, but it didn\u2019t make any sense that the trainees could\u2019ve killed the Green War Demon and the green demons.\u201cWe just killed him.\u201d\u201cT-tell me in more detail!\u201d\u201cHmm, the guy behind me will tell you in more detail, since I need to heal my wounds.\u201d\u201cAh, right. That\u2019s right.\u201dBrukas nodded. Raon\u2019s wound was serious for sure. A normal person would\u2019ve been crying and going crazy.\u201cServiane, you shall cure Raon.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dServiane was the healer as well as the branch\u2019s vice-manager. He was standing in a daze, then followed Raon upon hearing his order.\u201cSo, what exactly happened here? Tell me every single detail.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you will believe me\u2026\u201dBurren described everything that had happened, without any exaggeration nor reduction.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any\u2026\u201dBrukas exclaimed in a hoarse voice. His throat felt clogged because of the ridiculousness of the story.\u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201dEvery trainee, including Burren, Runaan, and Martha, nodded.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dIt was absurd.\u2018He cut off his arm with a surprise attack from the back, then cut off his head in the end?\u2019That was already surprising enough. However, he couldn\u2019t do anything other than scream in astonishment from hearing what happened next.\u2018He withstood the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s attacks for almost ten minutes\u2026\u2019Burren said Raon allowed everyone to escape, then held back the Blood Raving Demon until Rimmer appeared.Raon was a mere fifteen-year-old trainee, one that wasn\u2019t even qualified as a swordsman. And apparently, he crossed swords with the Blood Raving Demon, who was a Master. His head was going numb from the absurdity.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dBrukas sighed and examined the trainees. Judging from their unwavering eyes, they were only stating the truth.He turned around to look at the house that Raon had entered.He swallowed. Even the current Head of House, Lord Glenn wouldn\u2019t have been able to fight against the Blood Raving Demon at the age of fifteen.\u2018Monster\u2026\u2019That was the only word he could think of. Genius wasn\u2019t enough for Raon Zieghart. He was a real monster.***\u201cI-I\u2019ll be leaving, then.\u201dServiane, who introduced himself as the branch\u2019s vice-manager, stood up after bandaging him up with medicine.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cOh, it was nothing.\u201dHe went outside after shaking his hand.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon leaned his back against the wall, enduring the pain.\u2018It feels like a dream.\u2019He still couldn\u2019t believe that he had killed the Green War Demon and survived against the Blood Raving Demon with his problematic body.\u2018I was lucky.\u2019He managed to get the upper hand against the Green War Demon thanks to the trainees attracting his attention, and he managed to hold on against the Blood Raving Demon thanks to the growth he got from that.It wouldn\u2019t have been weird for him to die in either of the situations if he had been missing anything.\u2018But I managed to grow once again.\u2019Raon clenched his fist. His stats, experience, and prowess had all increased through the difficult battle against the Blood Raving Demon.He was a completely different person from before arriving at Cebu village.He was definitely at the novice level Sword Expert now.\u2018It seems hardship is necessary in order to get stronger.\u2019It was something he had felt in his previous life, that the opportunity only came through the wave called crisis.\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2019Raon grinned, shaking the ice flower bracelet containing Wrath.\u201cI managed to grow up even more thanks to you.\u201dUgh\u2026Wrath surged from the ice flower along with a blue flame.The King of Essence has never made such a sloppy bet. You didn\u2019t kill that rough guy wearing an ogre's helmet.\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201dRaon shook his head.\u201cThe bet between us was about the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s death. That means it doesn\u2019t matter who killed him.\u201dKugh, damn it!Wrath boiled in intense anger. He started lamenting that he didn\u2019t check the bet properly because the situation was so critical.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019Raon frowned, instead of making fun of Wrath like always. His feelings were touching him a lot more deeply than usual.\u2018Is it because I received his wrath?\u2019It seemed he could feel his emotion a lot better because he had received his wrath.\u2018It\u2019s more dangerous than I thought.\u2019It was just ten points of Wrath, yet it already had a significant effect. It looked like he needed to be more careful in making contracts with him in the future.\u201cLet\u2019s check it again.\u201dRaon increased the tone of his voice to pretend nothing special had happened and opened the previous messages.[You\u2019ve won the bet against \u2018Wrath\u2019.][All stats have increased by 3.][You have achieved the fourth victory against Wrath.][Extra stats have increased with the effect of four consecutive victories.][Strength has increased by 1.][Agility has increased by 2.][Energy has increased by 1.]He even got extra points like when he won the third bet. They were generous rewards, befitting the giving Wrath.Clench!Raon clenched his fist. He could feel his exhausted muscles reviving with his stats increasing at once.I shouldn\u2019t have made that damned bet!Wrath shouted that it was a scam and covered the entire room with coldness.\u201cThere\u2019s still more, you know.\u201d[A trait of \u2018Wrath\u2019 has been created as the second reward of the bet.][The trait has been decided.][The trait \u2018Iron Will\u2019 has been created.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed he was displeased with the trait called \u2018Iron Will\u2019.\u2018Which means this must be a good trait.\u2019It had to be a great trait if Wrath was hating that he had it. Raon opened the status window, filled with anticipation.Status WindowName : Raon Zieghart.Title: \u2018Indomitable\u2019.State: Curse of Frost (Five Strands).Trait: Wrath, Ring of Fire (Four-Stars), Water Resistance (Four-Stars), Perception of the Snow Flower (Three-Stars), Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation (Three-Stars), Coldness of the Frost (Three-Stars), Fire Resistance (Three-Stars), Bleeding Curse (One-Star), Backstab (One-Star), Iron Will (One-Star).\u2014Strength: 62Agility: 63Stamina: 56Energy: 47Perception: 66Wrath: 10Confirming the increase in stats from the reward, Raon checked his new trait, \u2018Iron Will\u2019.Iron WillReduce pain by momentarily increasing willpower upon receiving severe physical or mental damage.He admired it upon reading the message. Now that he had the trait, he could resist like before even after receiving wrath from Wrath.\u201cI got lucky.\u201dIt\u2019s not luck. It\u2019s thanks to the greatness of the King of Essence\u2019s system.Wrath ground his teeth while glaring at the message.\u2018I made it so well that it\u2019s troublesome.\u2019Wrath made the system prioritize creating the most necessary trait for the moment.That aspect also applied to Raon, and \u2018Iron Will' was created as a result because Raon needed it the most at the moment.Tsk.It was irritating.\u2018I thought I could finally conquer him now\u2026\u2019He had finally obtained a blade that worked against Raon, thanks to him accepting wrath, but the trait had returned them to where they\u2019d started.\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019Wrath calmed his boiling emotion. He didn\u2019t want to give away free stats by getting angry like an idiot anymore.\u2018I have plenty of time.\u2019His recovery speed was getting faster, albeit slightly, and he had managed to give some wrath to Raon.He was growing pretty quickly for a human, but Wrath was going to win in the end.\u2018Just you wait. Your body and soul are mine. I\u2019ll lock you up in a glacier for eternity.\u2019Wrath glared at Raon with a cold gaze.\u201cTsk, tsk.\u201dRaon looked at Wrath and clicked his tongue.\u201cJudging from your expression, you are thinking about something useless again.\u201dYou are the one with useless thoughts. A mere human would never be able to understand the great and mighty King of Essence\u2019s thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious. You must\u2019ve resolved to wait and endure until you can eat up my body and lock my soul up in a glacier.\u201dUrgh!Wrath\u2019s jaw dropped.You bastard, when did you learn to read minds?\u201cThere\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t notice with everything I\u2019ve heard and seen so far. Your thoughts and actions are in the palm of my hand.\u201dRaon opened his right hand and swayed it.A mere human dares\u2026!Wrath exploded in anger, despite having resolved to not get caught up in Raon\u2019s provocation.Wham!Wrath\u2019s coldness, which became even more intense, crushed against Raon.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon bit his lip from inside.\u2018This isn\u2019t a joke\u2026\u2019Even considering his wounded state, the pain had become way worse than before. It felt like sharp icicles were stinging his entire body.It was a dire amount of pain despite having four stars in \u2018Water Resistance\u2019. Accepting wrath was extremely dangerous.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dHe resonated his four rings of fire and ground his teeth to endure the pain, over and over again.[You\u2019ve experienced an intolerable amount of pain.][The Iron Will has activated.]Along with the message, the pain pressing upon his mind and body subsided significantly.Krrrrr! The King of Essence is going to put an end to this ill-fated relationship with you!Though Wrath kept generating wrath and coldness with everything he had, they weren\u2019t really difficult to endure\u2014just like before he\u2019d taken on his wrath.[You\u2019ve resisted Wrath\u2019s possession in a severely injured state.][Perception has increased by 1.]His mind grew a bit clearer with the message.Damn it. Just what is going on here?Wrath kept swearing while falling out of his body. He looked more like a delinquent than the monarch of Wrath.\u201cI already told you.\u201dRaon snickered and shook his right hand.\u201cYou can\u2019t win against me. You are too obvious.\u201dHowever, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable on the inside.\u2018He is recovering his power even faster.\u2019Wrath\u2019s energy was getting stronger and stronger. If Raon couldn\u2019t get stronger faster than him, Wrath would end up eating him up.\u201cHaa.\u201dKrrrr!Raon and Wrath were preparing to devour each other despite being at a close distance to each other.***The next day, Raon woke up after noon, then went outside.When he looked at the village, the reconstruction had advanced a little. It seemed the swordsmen from the branch and the trainees had been working on it throughout the night and the morning.\u201cYou woke up.\u201dBranch Manager Brukas, who was around the wooden fence, came up to Raon.His gaze was different from the day before. He was looking at him like a mysterious animal.It seemed he heard the story about him killing the Green War Demon and fighting the Blood Raving Demon from the other trainees.\u201cHow is your body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better now.\u201dRaon nodded slowly. He wasn\u2019t sure what kind of medicine Rimmer had used, but the broken bone was reattached, and the flesh was regrowing on his torn waist and thigh.It seemed he could return to his normal state soon enough, as long as he focused on his recovery once he returned.\u201cYou did really great. You killed the Green War Demon at the age of fifteen and survived a fight against the Blood Raving Demon. It\u2019s nothing short of being called an achievement.\u201dBrukas swallowed, giving him a thumbs up.\u2018No, it\u2019s more than an achievement.\u2019No one would believe that a trainee yet to become a swordsman managed to kill the Green War Demon from Eden and fought against the Blood Raving Demon for more than ten minutes.Even if he returned to the house and spread the news, the majority wouldn\u2019t believe it.He examined Raon carefully. He was severely wounded, wrapped in bandages, yet he didn\u2019t show any weakness on the outside nor complain about it.He could only be amazed and wonder what he had to go through to have that much patience and might at that age.\u201cWe are going to take care of the rest here, so you shall return to the house with the trainees. We did first aid, but many of you are severely wounded\u2014including you. You should return and get treated properly.\u201d\u201cI see, thank you for your consideration.\u201d\u201cWe are Ziegharts, after all.\u201dBrukas smiled lightly and waved his hand.\u201cWell, then.\u201dRaon bowed slightly and went to the other trainees.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBrukas stared at Raon\u2019s back blankly.\u2018He held his ground against the Blood Raving Demon\u2026\u2019Even though he was an intermediate Expert, he wasn\u2019t confident he could survive for five minutes against the Blood Raving Demon.The story about Raon fighting against him for ten minutes after letting the trainees escape was both surprising and impressive at the same time.\u2018He looks huge.\u2019Even though he was a young boy less than half his age, his back looked huge to him.\u2018Anyway.\u2019Brukas smiled, looking up at the sun shining upon the world from the middle of the sky.\u2018There\u2019s going to be an uproar in the house.\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cRaon.\u201dRunaan ran up to Raon like a puppy that saw food. After checking his entire body, her eyes drooped.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t anymore.\u201dRaon shook his head and smiled. It wasn\u2019t a lie since the pain had really subsided significantly.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry anymore.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dThe corners of Runaan\u2019s mouth were slightly lifted. It seemed she had gotten slightly better at expressing her emotions.\u201cWe are going to return to the house, so tell everyone to prepare to depart.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dShe visibly nodded, then ran towards where the other trainees were.\u201cAre we going to return right away?\u201dBurren, who was watching them, approached him silently.\u201cYes. The branch manager told us to return since he is going to take care of the rest.\u201d\u201cHah, where the hell did our instructor go?\u201dBurren frowned and kicked the ground.\u201cIs your body really alright?\u201d\u201cThe wounds still remain, but they are recovering.\u201d\u201cMake sure to recover completely, since I need to defeat you in your perfect state.\u201d\u201cEven though you saw that?\u201d\u201cBecause I saw that.\u201dHis blue eyes were unwavering, as if a boulder was weighing down on them.\u201cI\u2019m not going to give up or withdraw. If I can\u2019t walk then I\u2019ll crawl, if that means I can chase after you.\u201dHis voice contained an unbreakable will. It seemed Burren had also grown up throughout the mission.\u201cAnd.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI silenced those that know you can use the ice aura. Since you saved their lives, they aren\u2019t going to reveal your secret.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRaon\u2019s lips parted.\u2018He even did that for me?\u2019He thought he had no choice but to reveal he had two auras, but it seemed Burren had stopped the trainees from talking about it for him.Raon was dumbfounded, since it was completely unexpected.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be surprised. I just did what I could since you saved my life.\u201dBurren scratched the side of his nose and turned around.\u201cI\u2019ll prepare for departure. You should rest a bit more.\u201dAfter saying that, he went to where the other trainees were.\u2018He really changed a lot.\u2019He had changed so much that it was difficult to believe he was full of jealousy when he first met him.Raon thought the fifth training ground\u2019s miracle might have been Burren, instead of himself.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon packed up his belongings and went towards the village center.\u201cWe need to repair that properly, so just pile up the wood for now!\u201dThe slightly injured village chief was commanding the villagers.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous if you pile it up vertically, so put it next to\u2026 Oh! Benefactor!\u201dUpon noticing Raon, he quickly ran up to him.\u201cA-are you alright? You are severely injured because of me\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because of you, village chief.\u201d\u201cBut you fought against that monster in order to save this worthless man. I really don\u2019t know how I can thank you.\u201dThe village chief knelt and lowered his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWatching the village chief expressing his gratitude, he reminisced on when he first met the Blood Raving Demon.\u2018That time\u2026\u2019The moment the Blood Raving Demon attacked them, he instinctively hugged the village chief and stepped back. His body had moved on its own, despite knowing that he would get injured.\u2018I wonder why I did that.\u2019It wasn\u2019t actually necessary to do that.Since he had already gotten the goblin king\u2019s magic stone and heard the story, there was no reason to save him.Yet he had saved him, getting injured in the process.\u2018I\u2019m changing.\u2019It could be because of Sylvia, or Rimmer, or the children, or the circumstances.Regardless of the reason, he was going through a change.And he didn\u2019t dislike it. It felt like the clothes called emotions were being put on an empty wooden doll.\u201cPlease stand up.\u201dRaon smiled lightly and made the shivering village chief stand. His old eyes were filled with deep emotions and gratitude.\u201cJust like I said before, I\u2019ll take this gemstone, since they might come after it again if left alone.\u201d\u201cPlease, go ahead!\u201dThe village chief firmly nodded his head.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it carelessly, and if somebody visits you looking for the gem, tell them Zieghart took it along with a few other objects.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201dThe village chief nodded. He looked like he just received a god\u2019s revelation.Why are you saying that? Can\u2019t you tell him everything?\u2018It\u2019s better that he doesn\u2019t know.\u2019He needed to erase the information about Eden looking for the gem by taking other objects on top of the gem.\u2018I can sell this information for a high price.\u2019Raon grinned. He wasn\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to sell Eden's information to Glenn.***The trainees left Cebu village, accepting the villagers' heartfelt cheers.Burren led the trainees from the front instead of the injured Raon, and Runaan followed right behind Raon like a duckling.Martha was walking on her own like always, but she was deep in thought with cloudy eyes.Raon carefully examined his surroundings, standing at the center.\u2018My perception has increased thanks to the stats.\u2019Thanks to having killed the Green War Demon and the Blood Raving Demon, as well as the stats he extorted from Wrath, his perception had gotten significantly better.The range had increased, and it became easier to find people that were hiding their presence.He felt like he could find a Red Eye Demon\u2019s location in no time if one was hiding nearby.Upon increasing the range of his perception to prepare for Eden\u2019s attack, just in case, he found one person\u2019s presence.\u2018Rimmer!\u2019He could feel Rimmer\u2019s refreshing wind. He was still watching over the trainees instead of returning.\u2018I guess that\u2019s normal.\u2019Since Eden or another organization might attack them, it was as plain as day that he would decide to stay.Pfft.Rimmer\u2019s presence suddenly vanished, like an extinguishing candlelight. It seemed he noticed he was detected.\u2018He is really peculiar.\u2019Raon snickered and followed the trainees after erasing his aura perception.A moment later.Rimmer came down from the tree on the path the trainee went down. He shook his head with an expression of disbelief.\u201cThat monstrous guy\u2026\u201dHe knew Raon had grown tremendously during the last few days, but he didn\u2019t expect him to see through his concealment.\u201cI wonder how he is going to react if I tell him about this.\u201dRimmer grinned, thinking about Glenn\u2019s dignified expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What have you done this time?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201dGlenn frowned and narrowed his eyes. His aura split apart like knitting wools and burrowed into Rimmer\u2019s body.Whir.The pain in his mana circuit and energy center caused by opening the Sword Field started to subside.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dRimmer gasped.\u2018Did he get even stronger?\u2019He managed to fix his body\u2019s balance from just controlling his aura. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Glenn was already at a demigod\u2019s level.\u2018No, he was already at that level.\u2019Glenn had never shown his true strength in about ten years. It was more accurate to say that it was a portion of his true ability, rather than that he'd gotten stronger.Whir.After soothing his muscles, bones and internal organs, Glenn\u2019s aura disappeared like smoke. His body had gotten a lot better.\u201cThank you.\u201dRimmer stopped fidgeting with his fingers and bowed to him properly.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I don\u2019t want to see you trembling like that when you are already weak as you are.\u201d\u201cHuhu, I\u2019ll be counting on you in the future.\u201d\u201cStop your pleasantries and get to the point.\u201d\u201cAh, you are right.\u201dHe raised his head and smiled.\u201cI brought news about your grandson that my lord has been looking forward to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn looked down on Rimmer indifferently, not responding.\u201cDo you want me to tell you about it already?\u201dRimmer giggled and raised his body.\u201cActually, something interesting happened during the mission.\u201d\u201cInteresting?\u201d\u201cYes, Eden was in Cebu village.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dGlenn\u2019s pupils dilated. It seemed the news managed to surprise him despite him being at a demigod\u2019s level.\u201cConsidering the branch office didn\u2019t manage to notice them despite having examined Cebu village and Cebu Mountain beforehand, they must\u2019ve arrived after their investigation.\u201d\u201cGet to the point, quickly.\u201d\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll tell you what happened from the start. I found a Red Eye Demon upon arriving there before anyone else. After wondering what to do, I decided to leave the matter to the children. Then\u2026\u201dRimmer nodded and told him about what happened in Cebu.\u201c\u2026When I reached that place, Raon was holding his ground against the Blood Raving Demon despite his ruined body.\u201d\u201cBlood Raving Demon? Do you think that makes any sense\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. A fifteen-year-old trainee killed the Green War Demon and survived the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s fist? Anyone would be criticized for telling such a story. However!\u201dHe raised his long finger.\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I witnessed it, the trainees witnessed it, and the villagers witnessed it as well. I\u2019m sure the head of house will also realize it upon seeing Raon. He is already at the novice level Sword Expert.\u201d\u201cYou said he survived. How is his body, then?\u201dDespite being a transcender, Glenn\u2019s eyes were filled with question and worry.\u201cI told you such amazing news, yet you are just worrying about his body. I guess he\u2019s not your family for nothing.\u201d\u201cSilence, just answer my question.\u201d\u201cHis left arm was broken, and his muscles were torn. I heard he took the first blow while trying to save the village chief.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn\u2019s mouth twisted slightly upon hearing it.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I saw that expression. I guess you are proud of your grandson and worried at the same time.\u201d\u201cHow is he right now?\u201d\u201cI gave him the Elvrin sap. He will return sturdier than ever.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s.\u201dGlenn narrowed his eyes. Elvrin was the name of the second World Tree, and its sap was a priceless treasure.\u201cSince he was heavily injured, he wasn\u2019t going to recover perfectly if I didn\u2019t take proper measures quickly. And what can I say? It didn\u2019t feel like a waste at all.\u201dRimmer shrugged his shoulders.\u201cWhere are the trainees right now?\u201d\u201cThey should arrive at the house in one or two days.\u201d\u201cWe are going to hold the house conference as soon as they return. Summon the division leaders in advance.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dGlenn ordered while closing his eyes, and Roenn, who was standing still in surprise stepped up.\u2018Raon, we can extort a lot.\u2019Rimmer grinned, seeing Glenn\u2019s expression.\u201cRimmer.\u201d\u201cAh, yes?\u201dGlenn\u2019s voice suddenly spoke up when he thought it was over.\u201cWhy did you go there instead of sending another instructor?\u201d\u201cI just\u2026 Wanted to watch the children\u2019s growth.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dGlenn scratched his chin and continued.\u201cGood job. And well done.\u201d\u201cOh? How long has it been since the last time you complimented me? It\u2019s been almost twenty years\u2026\u201d\u201cYou would\u2019ve been complimented more often if you didn\u2019t act like a fool.\u201d\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s true.\u201dRimmer burst out in laughter. He couldn\u2019t even remember when he last laughed genuinely in front of the head of house, and he saw the head of house\u2019s visible smile.It felt like the house had started moving once again, thanks to Raon.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon and the trainees managed to arrive in front of Zieghart\u2019s front gate after fifteen days.Rumble!Along with a ground shaking noise, the massive silver gate was swung open.The gatekeeper swordsmen were standing still behind it, guarding the gate and the castle walls.It was the same sight as when they had left on the mission.However, one thing had changed.The eyes of the gatekeeper\u00a0swordsmen\u00a0used to be as adamant as stone status, but they were now filled with surprise and curiosity.\u201cWelcome back.\u201dThe guard captain\u2019s voice had also changed. He wasn\u2019t treating them as novice trainees, but real swordsmen that had returned from a mission.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon bowed at the gatekeepers and narrowed his eyes.\u2018Rimmer spread the story.\u2019It was obvious. Since the people from the branch were still in Cebu village, it must\u2019ve been Rimmer who told everyone about it.\u201cI\u2019m sure you want to rest, but there\u2019s a place you have to visit beforehand. Everyone shall go to the lord\u2019s manor, the lord is waiting for you.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cLord\u2019s manor?\u201d\u201cThe head of house is waiting?\u201dUpon hearing that the head of house had summoned them, the trainees\u2019 eyes widened.\u201cGo there immediately.\u201dThe guard captain pointed towards the lord\u2019s manor and ordered the gate closed.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSince Raon had already expected it, he nodded and led the trainees towards the lord\u2019s manor.Everyone stood still and watched them as they passed the main street.Raon could even hear their whispers, thanks to his improved perception.\u201cThat\u2019s him, right? Raon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cDid he really defeat the Green War Demon, despite being that small?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I heard he withstood the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s attacks.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t really feel his pressure, though. Is he really an Expert? I think he is more like an advanced level User.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s another false rumor from Rimmer?\u201d\u201cRimmer is lazy, but he didn\u2019t sink so low as to spread a false rumor.\u201dThey were cheerfully making a fuss about whether Rimmer\u2019s story was true or not.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon sighed lightly and entered the lord\u2019s manor.\u201cCongratulations on your return after a successful mission.\u201dGlenn\u2019s butler, Roenn, bowed his head. The other servants also lowered their heads after him.\u2018Certainly\u2026\u2019Their reaction hadn\u2019t changed from before, probably because they were the real deal.\u201cPlease, come this way. Everyone is waiting.\u201d\u201cDoes \u2018everyone\u2019 mean\u2026\u201d\u201cOn top of the head of house, there are also the division leaders.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-the division leaders?\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026\u201dRaon turned around hearing a light groan. The trainees were licking their dry lips with nervous expressions.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be nervous. We just need to tell them what happened, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. You just need to convey what you saw and experienced during the mission.\u201dRoenn nodded with a bright smile.\u2018He is indeed different.\u2019He had seen countless talents while assisting Glenn, but it was his first time seeing a boy like Raon.He wasn\u2019t ignorant of the importance of the situation because of his young age. He was fully aware of it, yet he was completely calm and composed. His mindset was truly outstanding.\u201cPlease, come this way.\u201dRoenn bowed slightly and guided them through the wide hallway.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dRaon followed right behind Roenn, heading to the audience chamber. The audience chamber\u2019s door was already open, exuding frightening pressure from the inside.\u201cHaa.\u201dHe breathed out, then entered. The throne was the only chair on the platform, unlike during the Judgment Ceremony, and swordsmen he had never seen before were standing in a single line underneath.\u2018They are Zieghart\u2019s squad and division leaders.\u2019Their pressures were sending a chill down his spine. The energy and spirit they possessed was different from average people.\u2018And\u2026\u2019He could feel it even more clearly now that he was at the Expert level.Glenn Zieghart.His tremendous energy was too much for him to properly perceive. It seemed as if his energy, emanating from the audience chamber, was reaching the entirety of Zieghart\u2019s domain.\u2018How fearsome.\u2019In that place, where powerful people were gathered, he was the only one standing on a different dimension.\u201cGreeting my lord!\u201dRaon knelt at the center of the audience chamber and bowed his head.\u201cGreeting my lord!\u201dThe trainees followed him, bowing in the same posture.\u201cRise.\u201dThey all raised their heads, feeling Glenn\u2019s heavy voice in their heart.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard you were at the center of the Cebu village incident. Tell me about it in detail.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRaon stood up while organizing his thoughts.\u201cOnce we reached Cebu village, I could feel somebody observing us. I first thought it was one of the instructors, but that wasn\u2019t the case. In order to obtain more accurate information\u2026\u201dHe opened his mouth after meeting the eyes of everyone; the squad and division leaders standing at the very back, Rimmer who was yawning, and Glenn.\u201cWhile I was prepared to meet my end\u2014having exhausted my strength from stopping the Blood Raving Demon\u2014I managed to survive thanks to Instructor Rimmer, who came to help.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe whole audience chamber fell silent, as heavy as a lump of steel.\u201cMy lord.\u201dBurren\u2019s father and Glenn\u2019s second son, Karoon Zieghart raised his chin.\u201cDo you think that makes any sense at all? They are just fifteen- or sixteen-year-old children. The Green War Demon would\u2019ve been enough to annihilate them, yet he stood his ground against the Blood Raving Demon! It can be nothing other than nonsense!\u201d\u201cBut big brother, the branch has also reported to us that multiple traces of Eden have been found.\u201d\u201cI told you I witnessed it. Is it that hard to believe?\u201dRimmer snorted while picking his ears.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem to start with! How am I supposed to believe a cripple like you managed to defeat the Blood Raving Demon! Give me the proof\u2026\u201dClank!The sudden sound of metal directed everyone\u2019s gaze towards Raon.Two lumps of metal were lying in front of him. They were the Green War Demon and the Blood Raving Demon\u2019s helmets.\u201cGreen War Demon and Blood Raving Demon\u2019s helmets\u2026\u201d\u201cW-was it actually true?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe division leaders\u2019 eyes widened upon seeing the helmets.\u201cEden\u2019s helmets aren\u2019t the problem! What I\u2019m asking you is how you managed to kill them! A surprise attack? You aren\u2019t even an assassin, so how was it even supposed to be possible!\u201dRaon couldn\u2019t say that he used to be an assassin.\u201cMy lord.\u201dInstead of looking at Karoon or the other division leaders, Raon looked up at Glenn, who was in front of him.\u201cCan I draw my sword?\u201dGlenn nodded very lightly.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon bowed his head and drew his sword from his waist. Crimson flame flared up from the silver damaged blade.Roar!The flame surrounding the blade lit up the entire audience chamber like the intense flame burning inside the furnace.\u201cA-aura blade, and such a flame on top of it\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I heard it was a very tiny flame, though.\u201d\u201cIs he a Sword Expert? At that age?\u201d\u201cN-nonsense\u2026\u201d\u201cHis level seems enough to fight equally against the Green War Demon.\u201dThe division leaders\u2019 eyes widened in surprise upon seeing Raon\u2019s aura blade.\u201cI told you already. That guy\u2019s a monster.\u201dRimmer giggled, watching the astonished division leaders.Glenn Zieghart\u2019s expression didn\u2019t seem to have changed at all. However, those who knew him well could notice the corner of his lips twitching.Whap!Raon lowered his sword, burning in a crimson flame, and raised his chin.\u201cWas that enough of an explanation?\u201dThere was no response to his words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought he was an advanced level Aura User, yet he was using the aura blade, which was the symbol of an Expert.To be able to use an aura blade at the age of fifteen\u2026 He was certainly one of the best geniuses of the continent, or a monster.\u2018But even an Expert wouldn\u2019t be able to fight against the Blood Raving Demon.\u2019Expert was certainly a level that could be called powerful. However, it wasn\u2019t that great at the continent\u2019s scale.\u201cEven if you are an Expert, the Blood Raving Demon is a Master. You definitely could not hold your ground against him at your level. Same goes for defeating the Green War Demon! Spit out the tru\u2026\u201d\u201cFather.\u201dBurren, who was kneeling behind Raon, stepped forward.\u201cI witnessed it. Raon killed the Green War Demon and stood against the Blood Raving Demon in order to buy time for our and the villagers\u2019 escape, despite having injured an arm.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201dRunaan stepped forth, following Burren and nodding. Her gaze was directed to her father, Rokan Sullion, on her right side.\u201cI never permitted you to open your mouth!\u201dKaroon glared at Burren, with an expression of looking at a trained animal rather than his son.\u201cHuh. I don\u2019t even know what you want if you can\u2019t even believe your son. You are so stubborn that nothing can get through to you. I wonder how you even eat and poop, the way you are.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth, Rimmer.\u201dKaroon glared at the shrugging Rimmer as if he wanted to kill him.\u201cWhat you did is the most problematic part. There\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve killed the Blood Raving Demon with that broken body, unless you are scamming us\u2026\u201d\u201cThen shall we fight? I also want to see how amazing the Central Martial Palace master is after such a long time.\u201d\u201cFine, I\u2019ll cut that thin neck right away\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dAn overwhelmingly heavy voice interrupted Rimmer and Karoon\u2019s bickering.\u201cHup!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dThe tremendous presence was making everyone\u2019s spines tense.\u201cTop trainee Raon Zieghart, and every trainee of the fifth training ground, shall listen.\u201dGlenn raised his chin from the hand supporting it and continued, looking down at everyone.\u201cYou did excellent.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cFather?\u201d\u201cMy lord\u2026\u201dGlenn\u2019s unexpected compliment made everyone\u2019s jaws drop; the division leaders, the heads of vassal families, and even the trainees.Everyone inside the audience chamber looked at Glenn with bewildered expressions.It was a natural reaction.Glenn Zieghart was a cold-blooded person, one that was stingier than anyone with his compliments.\u2018Good job\u2019 was the best he would say, no matter how difficult the mission one had accomplished, and he hadn\u2019t said \u2018excellent\u2019 to anyone in decades.\u201cI got the first report from Rimmer, then another from the branch officer that investigated the Cebu area, and they all are in agreement with the third report I\u2019m getting from you.\u201dGlenn raised his right hand, the one used to support his chin.\u201cFirstly, you noticed the existence of enemies and didn\u2019t take any reckless actions.\u201dHe folded his index finger.\u201cSecondly, you tried to grasp the enemies instead of trying to fight them immediately after returning.\u201dHe folded his middle finger this time.\u201cThirdly, you weakened the enemy with a surprise attack after waiting for the best moment and ended the Green War Demon\u2019s life with a hidden strike.\u201dEach time Glenn folded a finger, the division leaders\u2019 eyes became wider.\u201cAnd finally, you stood in front of an unwinnable enemy in order to let your allies and civilians escape.\u201dHis eyes shone red, as he folded his four fingers.\u201cYour decisions were appropriate, like those of a seasoned warrior. There were no casualties among the trainees or the villagers thanks to your accurate decisions. And\u2026\u201dGlenn looked at the trainees behind Raon.\u201cYou also acted like true swordsmen of Zieghart. The reason that Zieghart can be the way it is right now is thanks to the people supporting from below.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cMy lord\u2026\u201dRoenn and Rimmer nodded firmly.\u201cWe aren\u2019t a kingdom, but we are reigning over the north as more than a kingdom. That\u2019s why we need to protect the people living in this land. No one would be willing to follow us otherwise. Good job, everyone.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dBurren, Runaan, Martha, and the trainees shouted while sticking their heads on the ground.\u201cUuuu!\u201d\u201cMy lord!\u201dThe trainees trembled upon receiving a compliment from the god. Burren was even shedding tears.\u201cI\u2019m going to grant a bronze tablet to you all.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dThe trainees hit their heads on the ground so hard they could have bled.\u201cAnd Raon Zieghart, who created and dealt with the entire situation, shall be granted a silver tablet.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon also knelt and bowed, following the other trainees.\u201cTsh.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dSome division leaders weren\u2019t pleased with Raon receiving a silver tablet, but no one could step up since it was Glenn\u2019s direct decree.\u201cRoenn.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoenn took the wide board placed on the table at his right side, going up onto the platform.Glenn lifted the cloth covering the board, revealing the forty-two copper and one silver tablet underneath.\u201cBurren Zieghart, step forward.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Undershtood!\u201dBurren bit his tongue while responding, but he acted as if nothing happened and walked up to the platform.\u201cFighting for those we need to protect was the right thing to do. However.\u201dBurren\u2019s mouth froze upon hearing him say \u2018however\u2019.\u201cRushing in without trying to identify the enemy's strength is no different than a beast. You shall broaden your horizons and take a wider view of the situation.\u201dGlenn looked over Burren at all the other trainees and continued.\u201cThis is directed to all of you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAfter giving the bronze tablet to Runaan, Martha, and all other trainees, he finally looked at Raon.\u201cRaon Zieghart, step forward.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRaon bowed deeply, then stood up to walk up onto the platform.\u2018I can feel their gazes.\u2019Irritated gazes were piercing through his heart from behind. They were from Karoon and the other collateral division leaders.However, Karoon\u2019s son Burren and the other collateral trainees weren\u2019t looking at him with jealousy. They were looking at him with pride instead. That was good enough for Raon.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dGlenn\u2019s gaze was still cold and dry. It felt like a frozen field in the middle of winter.However, something felt different from before.A small light existed in his gaze, like a single flower blooming from the snow field.He wasn\u2019t sure if that was good or bad.\u201cYou\u2019ve saved many people\u2019s lives. I acknowledge that endeavor and grant you this silver tablet. Keep training your body and mind in the future.\u201d\u201cCan I have a moment?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon stood still without taking the silver tablet Glenn was holding.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI have something to say.\u201d\u201cSomething to say?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s about Eden's objective.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dOne of Glenn\u2019s eyebrows raised slightly.\u201cI know the reason they came to Cebu village, and what they are after right now.\u201d\u201cHow dare you spout such a lie here!\u201dA furious voice could be heard from behind. It was Karoon\u2019s voice.\u201cEden\u2019s demons won\u2019t speak the truth even if you torture them by tearing off their limbs. There\u2019s no way you could have obtained that information!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cCertainly\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed, torture doesn\u2019t work against them.\u201dThe other division leaders nodded in agreement.\u201cAre you certain?\u201d\u201cYes, I am. However\u2026\u201dRaon turned and met Karoon\u2019s burning eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t want to reveal it in front of the people that are doubting it.\u201d\u201cWh-what?!\u201d\u201cThat arrogance!\u201d\u201cHow dare you! You haven\u2019t even received the title of swordsman!\u201dThe division leaders following Karoon gave off powerful pressures, but Raon wasn\u2019t daunted in the slightest.He had a greater achievement than them in his previous life, despite being weaker than them.\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201dIt was an occasion created by Rimmer and Glenn, an occasion where he could increase the reward for the mission. He wasn\u2019t going to allow anyone to get in the way.\u201cSilence! Where do you think this is\u2026\u201d\u201cKaroon Zieghart.\u201dKaroon shut his mouth upon hearing a heavy voice from the platform.\u201cI already told you to shut your mouth.\u201d\u201cHup!\u201dA chill ran down Raon\u2019s spine.The pressure wasn\u2019t directed at him, but it felt like his entire body was freezing up.\u201cF-father?\u201d\u201cGet out, including everyone else who spoke up just now.\u201dGlenn wasn\u2019t even looking at Karoon. Even though his son was an important member of the house, he was still cold-hearted towards him, without any mercy.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe five division leaders and vice leaders bit their lips. After glaring at Raon like they wanted to kill him, they left the audience chamber.\u201cSay it now. What have you seen there?\u201dNo amount of torture could get the information out of Eden\u2019s lackeys\u2019 stubbornness. All the gazes of division leaders and Glenn were focused on Raon\u2019s mouth who said he knew Eden\u2019s objective.\u201cThe Blood Raving Demon revealed their objective when he was certain he could kill me and all the other trainees.\u201d\u201cObjective?\u201d\u201cEden was looking for the monsters\u2019 magic stone.\u201dRaon took out the goblin king\u2019s magic stone from his chest. The red-hot light brightened up the dim audience chamber.\u201cIt\u2019s not just any magic stone, but from those commonly referred to as named monsters. This one is the goblin king\u2019s magic stone, the one that died in Cebu Mountain a few hundred years ago.\u201dRaon explained and extended the hand holding the magic stone.Whir.The goblin king\u2019s magic stone floated up on its own and went into Glenn\u2019s hand.\u201cHmm.\u201dGlenn narrowed his eyes and examined the magic stone.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe division leaders and squad leaders watched Glenn and Raon without even swallowing their saliva.\u201cCertainly.\u201dGlenn raised his head after checking the magic stone.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an ordinary object.\u201dGlenn said while looking at Raon, but he couldn\u2019t understand the meaning behind his gaze, whether he was proud of him or was laughing at him.\u201cIt\u2019s an achievement that nobody else has managed to do.\u201dThe corners of Glenn\u2019s mouth were raised slightly as he took the silver tablet from Roenn to give it to Raon.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dRaon slowly extended his hand to take the silver tablet.\u2018Was I mistaken?\u2019He thought he could trust him to reward him according to his deed, despite his dislike for himself and Sylvia.He had expected him to give an extra silver tablet or even a gold tablet, yet that wasn\u2019t the case. Glenn wasn\u2019t giving him anything else.\u2018I should\u2019ve just straight up told him to give me something in return.\u2019It was regrettable, but he couldn\u2019t ask him for a reward at that point. He slightly bit his lip and stepped down from the platform.\u201cEveryone shall return. A great conference will be held tomorrow morning, so everyone shall participate.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe division leaders and squad leaders responded loud and clear and bowed.\u2018Tsk.\u2019How foolish of you to not obtain anything after giving out such information.Raon clicked his tongue silently and Wrath sneered at him.***\u2018I trusted him too much.\u2019Raon shook his head. He had started to trust Glenn slightly after getting the \u2018Ten Thousand Flowers Cultivation\u2019, but that was apparently a mistake.He was living in Zieghart\u2019s jungle. He needed to take what he needed by himself.\u201cSir Raon.\u201dAs he was leaving the lord\u2019s manor with irritated steps, Roenn\u2019s voice was heard from the right hallway.\u2018Huh?\u2019Since Roenn had been in the audience chamber a moment ago, he couldn\u2019t understand how he was there.Moreover\u2026\u2018I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u2019His increased perception didn\u2019t manage to grasp his presence. It looked like he was a warrior after all, and an assassin like himself in his previous life.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dHe approached him with a gentle smile.\u201cMay I visit you in the annex building at midnight?\u201d\u201cPardon? Why would you visit\u2026\u201d\u201cThe head of house asked me to bring you here.\u201dRoenn lifted his finger to point at the audience chamber\u2019s huge door and smiled.\u201cI think he wanted to give you the second gift.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sylvia was biting her lip while running at him with red-rimmed eyes.\u201cOh my goodness!\u201dShe didn\u2019t care about her clothes getting dirty as she knelt down and started checking Raon\u2019s body.\u201cI-I heard you fought against Eden! Is your arm okay? What happened to your waist?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m almost healed.\u201dRaon smiled gently. He was almost completely healed thanks to Rimmer\u2019s medicine\u2019s effectiveness.\u201cI\u2026\u201dSylvia bit her lip, looking at the thick bandages wrapped around his arm, waist, and thigh. She looked like she would start crying at any moment.\u2018Ah, there was that\u2026\u2019She had lost her husband and daughter to Eden. Raon felt like he was too inconsiderate.\u201cMom, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI regretted it.\u201dSylvia lowered her head. Her hand trembled as she grabbed his arm.\u201cDo you remember what I told you before you left on the mission? That I wanted you to act like a true Zieghart.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cI really regretted it when I heard you fought against the Green War Demon, then stopped the Blood Raving Demon in order to save everyone.\u201dThe tear welling up in her eye ended up falling.\u201cI thought you made that decision because of what I said, I really\u2026\u201dHer pronunciation was awkward since she was crying, but Sylvia\u2019s feelings and message touched his heart.\u201cI wasn\u2019t only a mediocre swordsman, but I\u2019m also a bad mother\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m rather grateful to Mom.\u201dRaon grabbed Sylvia\u2019s trembling hands. He could feel the same warmth from her hand as her heart.\u201cG-grateful?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe nodded and smiled slightly.\u201cVarious thoughts came to my mind while fighting against the Blood Raving Demon. Should I run? How? Should I order Burren to fight then run away on my own? I might be able to survive if I run away while using the trainees as bait.\u201dRaon met Sylvia\u2019s trembling eyes with an embarrassed expression.\u201cThat\u2019s when I heard mom\u2019s voice. The voice that told me \u2018I want you to live like the Zieghart\u2019s swordsman from the past\u2019.\u201dIt was true. If it wasn\u2019t for Sylvia\u2019s voice resounding in his ears, he would\u2019ve run away without looking back or saving the village chief.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that, I would\u2019ve died while running away after abandoning everyone. Even if I managed to survive, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life, unable to wield a sword ever again.\u201dHe confessed his frightened emotions from that time with a cold breath.\u201cI was only able to stop the Blood Raving Demon and fight until the end thanks to what you told me, Mom. There\u2019s nothing to apologize for or regret.\u201dWhy am I fighting against the Blood Raving Demon? Why do I have to be the other people\u2019s shield? The reason he managed to endure that painful time was the fact that it was his own choice after following her words.\u201cSniff\u2026\u201dSylvia burst into the tears that she had been holding back so far. Her mind must\u2019ve been heavy ever since she heard the news about Eden.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dRaon repeated what she had told him in his childhood and rubbed her back.***Raon stayed by Sylvia\u2019s side until she grew exhausted and fell asleep, then he left her room. Helen was waiting for him outside the room.\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed the young master that used to be so small and young consoling my lady. Now I can die without any regrets.\u201dShe pretended to cry, hiding her eyes with her fingers.\u201cStop jesting and live for a very long time. I'll make you live in luxury with Mom.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the thought, young master.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just the thought.\u201dRaon shook his head and closed the door to Sylvia\u2019s room.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be looking forward to it with pleasure.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRaon nodded and went inside his room. Inside the dark room with closed curtains, a thin human shape could be found.\u201cJudiel.\u201dSince Raon was already aware of her presence, he called her name while sitting at his bed.\u201cYes, young master.\u201dJudiel, who was standing next to the window prostrated in front of Raon. Her expression was as stiff as cold marble.\u201cHow is the situation?\u201d\u201cI got the order to return from Central Martial Palace. They are going to dispose of me, by the looks of it.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon licked his lips while looking at Judiel\u2019s head.\u2018Is he venting his anger on her?\u2019Karoon Zieghart was the one that sent Judiel to the annex building. It looked like he decided to get rid of her, since she hadn\u2019t managed to obtain the information about Raon becoming a Sword Expert and he had made Karoon angry in the audience chamber just before.\u2018Yet\u2026\u2019Judiel herself was still composed, despite her life being in danger.He\u2019d thought she was average from the way she was terrified at the lake back then, but it seemed she was properly educated as a spy.\u201cDo you want to live?\u201dRaon slowly opened his mouth. His voice sounded like it didn\u2019t really matter whether Judiel died or lived.However, he was thinking about how to save her on the inside, since a double agent like her was difficult to obtain.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJudiel slowly raised her head. Her eyes were shivering like moonlight reflected in a lake. Just as she was when he first saw her, she was still holding on to her life.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the way you can survive.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go to the Central Martial Palace. Send a letter instead. Tell him you became Raon Zieghart\u2019s personal maid.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t suspect it if you write that my mom was worried about my body and picked you.\u201dRaon pointed at the wounds wrapped by bandages. Since the rumors said he was severely wounded, despite his actual status, it was going to work for sure.Moreover, Karoon was going to think he could obtain information more easily in the future since his spy became Raon\u2019s personal maid.\u201cTh-that\u2019s true. But why are you being so considerate towards me\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for you. It\u2019s because it would be a waste for me to lose a double agent like this.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you some good information on top of it. Everyone thinks I\u2019m severely wounded, but I\u2019ve actually almost finished healing. I\u2019m planning to train in the annex building, while pretending to recover.\u201dRaon gave Judiel the information about his injury without any hesitation.\u201cInstructor Rimmer and the head of house are the only people that know this fact right now. He is going to realize you are still useful if you tell him about this.\u201d\u201cI-indeed.\u201dJudiel nodded.\u201cThen, what are you waiting for?\u201dHe pointed at the door.\u201cGo and write that information on a letter and send it. You need to manage your expression, or he\u00a0will\u00a0find out.\u201d\u201cU-understood!\u201dJudiel lowered her head while covering her cheeks with her hands, then left the room.Everything she says and does is pathetic. What are you going to do with a useless spy like her?\u2018She is going to become the trap to stab Karoon Zieghart in the back. And\u2026\u2019Raon murmured on the inside while looking at the almost unrecognizable door in the darkness.Because she reminds me of my past self.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon was mindlessly lying on his bed, but he stood up as soon as the moon reached the top of the sky.It wasn\u2019t because the promised time had come, but because of the presence outside his window.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been waiting.\u201dRoenn greeted him with a smile as he opened the window.\u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t be sleeping after what you told me.\u201dRaon went over the window, putting a coat on his shoulders.\u201cSo, what did you mean earlier?\u201dHe opened his mouth, looking at Roenn\u2019s wrinkled eyes.\u201cHow can I know the head of house\u2019s intentions? You will see once you get there.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon asked because he wanted to know Glenn\u2019s intention, but Roenn wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. It was certain that he knew the answer, but he wasn\u2019t telling.He went to the lord\u2019s manor while chatting with Roenn. Curiously, the presence of the swordsmen standing guard in the area were gone.\u2018No one is here.\u2019Following Roenn, he entered the lord\u2019s manor without meeting anyone. Even the maids, servants, and swordsmen guarding inside the lord\u2019s manor were nowhere to be found.It seemed Roenn had ordered the place to be cleared out beforehand.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s heart pounded, feeling anxious and nervous in such an unknown situation.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so nervous, young master. What you did was a great accomplishment, one you can be proud of.\u201dHe opened the door to the audience chamber while saying that. The light poured out from the inside as the enormous door opened.Raon followed Roenn and entered the audience chamber. Glenn Zieghart, who was sitting on the throne like a statue, opened his eyes.\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019That was enough to fill the entire audience chamber with nervousness once again.\u201cGreeting my lord.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201dAs Raon was about to kneel and bow, his body froze as if he was petrified.\u2018This energy\u2026\u2019That wasn\u2019t what he was trying to do. Glenn had single handedly stopped his movement with his voice.\u2018Seriously\u2026\u2019Raon shuddered at his level of martial art and raised his head.Tap.Glenn removed the hand supporting his chin, looking down on Raon.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201dHe lowered his head with a trembling throat.\u201cWhat do you think about footwork?\u201d\u2018Let\u2019s see, footwork.\u2019Footwork was the way of walking.Footwork was the technique that created the most efficient way of moving in all situations: attack, defense, or even evasion and escape.\u201cI think it\u2019s the most efficient martial art, one that decides a warrior\u2019s life or death.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dGlenn nodded slightly, to a point where it was almost unnoticeable. Maybe he was pleased with the answer, or maybe he wasn\u2019t. Raon couldn\u2019t tell.\u201cWhat footwork did you use upon fighting against the Green War Demon and the Blood Raving Demon?\u201d\u201cI used the River Footwork.\u201dRaon had also used the Shadowless Steps on top of the River Footwork, but he didn\u2019t mention it.\u201cRiver Footwork is a great technique that can still be used after you get stronger, but its forms are too simple.\u201dHe was right.River Footwork was excellent footwork for sure, but it only had the basic forms.On the other hand, the \u2018Shadowless Steps\u2019 was a footwork focused on evasion and stealth, even more unsuitable for use than River Footwork in situations other than assassination.He had planned to ask for a new footwork with the extra tablet he should\u2019ve received, but the plan had gone completely awry.\u201cRaon.\u201dWhen he was licking his lip in frustration, Glenn called his name once again.\u201cI rewarded you with a silver tablet at noon for killing the Green War Demon and holding your ground against the Blood Raving Demon. However, I didn\u2019t give you anything for finding out their objective.\u201dRaon unconsciously gulped, since he could anticipate what he was going to say next.\u201cI\u2019ll teach you suitable footwork as a reward for discovering Eden\u2019s objective.\u201dGlenn stood from the throne. It felt like the highest mountain in the continent, the Erlast Mountain, had surged up in front of his eyes.He walked down the platform and extended his right foot to the front, then his left front to the back. His pressure was as proud as a noble and as tough as a general on the battlefield.\u201cWatch closely, since I\u2019m only going to show you once.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRaon held his breath.\u2018What an opportunity.\u2019Receiving instruction from the strongest warrior in the continent was the best opportunity he could get, incomparable to a mere tablet.It was such a big deal that it could bring the entire house Zieghart in an uproar.Whir!Raon resonated the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019, clearing up his bewildered mind.\u201cYou look like you are ready. I\u2019m starting, then.\u201dGlenn\u2019s feet separated the faint moonlight covering the floor.His relaxed movement made him look like he was on a stroll, but his flow was unpredictable.He flared up from the left like a red flame, then flowed down to the right like water. Raon was unable to breathe, watching the mysterious flow his feet were creating.Glenn\u2019s footwork was extremely difficult to understand. It was fast yet slow, soft yet hard at the same time.\u2018I still need to watch until the end.\u2019Giving up because it was too difficult was out of the question since learning just one tenth of Glenn\u2019s teachings was already more than worth it.Raon watched him without even blinking once until he stopped moving his feet.The entrancing moment felt like an instant, and Glenn stood in front of Raon. Despite having just demonstrated a boundless footwork, his breathing remained relaxed and he didn\u2019t seem unsettled in the slightest.\u201cDid you see it?\u201dThe red eyes, as sharp as a beast's, were asking him whether he had seen it properly\u2014how much he had understood.\u201c\u2026Please excuse me. I didn\u2019t manage to see it.\u201dRaon bit his lip and lowered his head. The footwork was on a completely different level, one that couldn\u2019t be understood with only four rings of fire.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt seemed Glenn was expecting that to happen, as he didn\u2019t show any reaction. He just looked down on him with emotionless eyes.\u201cShow me how much you understood.\u201dHe pointed at the floor and stepped back. It looked like he wanted him to repeat the footwork.\u2018He will be disappointed.\u2019He saw many flows, and felt the depth of the martial art. However, there was only a very small portion he was able to replicate in his current state. He felt like he could already feel the coldness of Glenn\u2019s gaze.\u2018Then\u2026\u2019Raon bit his lip slightly. He decided to repeat the one form that left the strongest impression, rather than awkwardly trying to replicate multiple movements.\u2018That\u2019s.\u2019The first step.The unusual posture, with right foot at the front and left foot at the back, was the start of the first step.Raon decided to replicate the first step that separated the moonlight and pierced through space.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon extended his left foot to the back and right foot to the front. His feet were shoulder-width apart. It was exactly the same posture as Glenn\u2019s, since Raon had observed it using the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019.\u2018The step incorporated everything.\u2019It was fast, slow, strong, smooth, and ever-changing at the same time. It was a step that could bring him anywhere.He raised his left foot.Putting together what he\u2019d felt from Glenn\u2019s demonstration and the principle of the martial arts he'd learned so far, he extended it to the front.Stomp!The golden moonlight covering the floor was distorted into a triangle, and an intense vibration traveled throughout the audience chamber.The step was extremely weak compared to Glenn\u2019s, but the flow was almost identical.It was the first step that could move in any direction, and in any way he wanted.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dGlenn narrowed his eyes, and Roenn\u2019s jaw dropped.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled and closed his eyes. He was feeling dizzy, despite having only taken a single step. He must\u2019ve been too focused and nervous.\u201cIs it over after that single step?\u201dGlenn turned around, looking at Raon\u2019s extended left foot.\u201cYes.\u201dRaon answered briefly and opened his eyes.\u201cDidn\u2019t\u00a0 you see more than that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I can\u2019t even repeat one tenth of it, let alone replicate it.\u201d\u201cHow come you can\u2019t repeat it?\u201d\u201cMy lord\u2019s footwork contained too many things, like a martial god\u2019s steps. It\u2019s impossible for my unskilled self to understand it completely.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean the first step was the easiest?\u201dGlenn\u2019s voice grew as cold as the severe winter\u2019s wind.\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201dRaon continued while looking at his extended left foot.\u201cFrom what I saw, the first step was the most important and the most impressive. I thought I should repeat the first step, since it was more impressive than any other footwork you showed me afterwards.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think the first step is the most important one?\u201d\u201cBecause the step can move in any direction, at any time, and in any way one desires. It was as shocking as watching the steps of an omnipotent existence, and the step is still stuck in my head.\u201dSince it was impossible to lie to Glenn about martial arts, Raon answered honestly about what he saw and felt.\u201cHmm.\u201dGlenn slightly nodded and spread his legs. His expression remained the same, but it felt like the atmosphere had become softer.\u201cYou have good instincts.\u201dHe took the same posture as the beginning, extending his left foot to the back and right foot to the front.\u201cThe footstep I showed you is called the Supreme Harmony Steps. Since you realized the first step, \u2018Heavenly Advance\u2019, is the most important\u2026 You are halfway there.\u201dGlenn took another step with an emotionless voice. Raon\u2019s hair stood on end upon seeing the step that could bring him anywhere in the world.Whir!His energy center vibrated, gathering his aura that controlled his body while dashing through his mana circuit.Stomp!Before he had even realized it, Raon replicated the Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 Heavenly Advance, exactly as Glenn had shown him.\u201cIt\u2019s better than before.\u201dGlenn nodded with an expressionless face, then turned around. He went up on the platform and nestled down into the throne.\u201cThat\u2019s it for the reward.\u201d\u201cWith that single step?\u201d\u201cI have shown you more than that, but you only managed to take one.\u201dHe closed his eyes. He appeared to be saying that he had nothing more to tell.\u201c\u2026Understood. Thank you.\u201dRaon licked his lips and nodded. It wasn\u2019t a big harvest but learning about the existence of such footsteps was an enlightenment in itself.\u201cYou can have this.\u201dGlenn threw something from his hand, and Raon caught the red gem falling in front of his chest.\u201cAh.\u201dIt was the goblin king\u2019s magic stone that he had given to Glenn earlier.\u201cObjects should belong to their rightful owner. Since it\u2019s an item you acquired, you should take it.\u201dHe dusted off his hands, showing he had no regret, then closed his eyes again.\u201cYou can put it in here.\u201dRoenn gave him a black fabric. It was the fabric with the ability to block the magic stone\u2019s energy.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon wrapped the fabric around the goblin king\u2019s magic stone and put it in his chest pocket.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect him to return this\u2026\u2019He thought he would study it, or break it, or put it in a warehouse. He didn\u2019t expect him to return it.Glenn\u2019s every single action was different from his expectation.\u201cYou shall return now.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dRaon stepped back. As he was about to open the audience chamber\u2019s room, he felt like he should do something before leaving since he had received a lot.\u201cErr\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cSt-stay healthy.\u201dSince he had no idea what he should be telling him, he offered the most common greeting for an elder and bowed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGlenn frowned without saying anything and Roenn covered his mouth with trembling hands.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dHe licked his lips and left the audience chamber. It looked like he shouldn\u2019t have said that.Stay healthy! You really looked like a fool right there!\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t know what to tell him since he had never sincerely thanked an elder.\u201cPhew.\u201dAs he walked down the corridor while sighing, a new message appeared in front of his eyes.[\u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 observed the perfected \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019.][Acquisition of \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 has accelerated.]* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The audience chamber was still filled with moonlight after Raon left.Roenn, who was looking at the moonlight covering the floor, raised his head.\u201cI didn\u2019t think my lord would hand over the Supreme Harmony Steps.\u201dHe thought he would give a special reward because of how much he cherished Raon, but he had never imagined he would give the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019.\u2018Because the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps' was created by none other than himself.\u2019The \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps' was the first footwork he had created after breaking through the demonic wall.It was a technique that was worth more than a golden tablet, one that he hadn\u2019t even taught his sons. Considering the fact that he gave such a technique to Raon, his affection for Raon was beyond his expectations.\u201cDid you see it?\u201dGlenn slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were reflecting a sugary light, unlike a moment ago when it was simply cold.\u201cHe repeated the \u2018Heavenly Advance\u2019 after watching it only twice.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cRaon. He took half of the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 after only watching it two times. Isn\u2019t he amazing?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just his eyes. His voice was also higher than usual, and the corners of his mouth were clearly raised.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dRoenn\u2019s jaw dropped. He\u2019d been living as Glenn\u2019s shadow for decades, yet it was his first time seeing him being so happy since his first son\u2019s birth.\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill the Green War Demon and hold his ground against the Blood Raving Demon by sheer luck. He has sharp eyes, and the way he controls his body and aura is rather extraordinary.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThe fact that Raon managed to grasp the core of the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 in such a short time was really astonishing.\u201cBut it\u2019s something else that impressed me the most.\u201dThe smile on Glenn\u2019s mouth became even more clear.\u201cHis judgment, right? It was really amazing how a fifteen-year-old managed to understand what was important and what could be thrown away. I also wanted to try teaching him if I get an opportunity.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not just talking about what happened today.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cThe fact that he stood against the Blood Raving Demon on his own in order to save everyone.\u201dGlenn continued while looking at the carpet where Raon\u2019s footstep still remained.\u201cRaon has good instincts. He must\u2019ve realized he could never win against the Blood Raving Demon the moment he saw him.\u201d\u201cThat seems likely.\u201d\u201cYet he stopped him until the very end. He didn\u2019t withdraw, buying time for the villagers and trainees to escape with his body broken from saving the village chief.\u201dThe Blood Raving Demon would\u2019ve turned the villagers and the trainees into a pool of blood if Raon hadn\u2019t held his ground.There weren\u2019t many people who could sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. The number of fifteen-year-old children capable of such a thing in the entire continent could be counted on a person\u2019s fingers\u2026A smile appeared on Glenn\u2019s face as he rejoiced at the fact that such a great boy was his grandson.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you smile like that in a long time.\u201dRoenn smiled.\u201cKhhm. I\u2019m not really happy.\u201dGlenn immediately lowered the corners of his lips. They were so low that he looked older than usual.\u201cSir Raden managed to destroy the White Blood Religion\u2019s branch, and Sir Raon eliminated the Green War Demon. We are getting a series of great news.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not that great and special.\u201dGlenn\u2019s corners of lips raised slightly once again upon hearing compliments about his grandsons.\u201cHeh.\u201dRoenn murmured \u2018is that so?\u2019 and nodded. His mouth was still smiling happily.\u201cBy the way, my lord couldn\u2019t hold back his smile when young master Raon told you to stay healthy earlier. If you want to pretend to be cold-blooded, you should\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not pretending!\u201dIt was rare for Glenn to shout, but the smile didn\u2019t disappear from Roenn\u2019s face.***\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dUpon returning to the annex building, Raon pointed at the message he saw earlier.Whoosh.Wrath, who was clinging to the bracelet like a parrot, surged up into the air.\u201cIt\u2019s a learning assistance.\u201d\u201cLearning?\u201dIt\u2019s one of the system\u2019s aspects the King of Essence created back in devildom in order to learn the techniques of powerful or peculiar existences. Among the arrogant ones that picked a fight with the King of the Essence\u2026\u201cIn short, it\u2019s increasing my learning ability.\u201dStop cutting me off!\u201cAnyway, was I right?\u201dHaa, pretty much.\u201cHow do I use it?\u201dDo you think I\u2019m going to tell you? If you take my wrath\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201dRaon snickered and wagged his finger.\u201cIt\u2019s making it easier to learn the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019. It\u2019s not even a secret.\u201dWhat arrogance!Wrath barked in irritation.\u201cI shall start immediately.\u201dRaon silently opened the window and went back outside.Just do it tomorrow after sunrise. I\u2019m too lazy to follow you outside.\u2018But there might be a time limit.\u2019There\u2019s no way such a thing\u2026\u2018It looks like I\u2019m right, judging from the way you\u2019re talking.\u2019H-how could you tell?\u2018Because your reaction was strange.\u2019Wrath would\u2019ve started boiling in anger, but he was only acting irritated. That was why Raon realized he was hiding something.\u201cI told you already, you are in the palm of my hand.\u201dStop your arrogance! The King of Essence is a monarch of devildom, who surpasses a mere human\u2019s estimations\u2026Wrath glared while spreading a frightening amount of coldness around him.\u2018Yes, I\u2019m talking about that.\u2019Raon pointed at Wrath\u2019s coldness as it was expanding into the air.\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have noticed anything strange if you acted like that from the beginning. You are really easy to deal with.\u2019Raon pushed Wrath away using the flame from the \u2018Ring of Fire\u2019 on his right hand.Damn it! You are the worst creature that the King of Essence has ever met!\u2018I guess being the worst for a demon king is a compliment, right?\u2019Keuh! I\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll kill you no matter wh\u2026\u2018Okay, do that later.\u2019Raon went to the training ground while listening to Wrath\u2019s cursing scream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed he could start training once again.\u2018Then.\u2019He smoothly kicked the ground, gathering the aura from the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019.Raon reached around the lake in no time. It was an extremely fast footwork, one that even his shadow couldn\u2019t follow, but his expression was grim.\u201cTsk.\u201dRaon clicked his tongue and narrowed his legs.\u2018This isn\u2019t it.\u2019The first step that Glenn had shown him was vast enough to reach anywhere in the continent, and free enough to achieve any kind of movement.It couldn\u2019t even be compared to the \u2018Heavenly Advance\u2019 of the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 that he had just used.\u2018He said it was a step that could achieve anything.\u2019Glenn described the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 as omnipotent and well-rounded. It was such an arrogant and haughty thing to say, but it was irrefutable after witnessing the steps.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about speed or strength.\u2019Raon\u2019s might was less than a speck compared to Glenn\u2019s. He needed to work on his foundation for the big picture rather than trying to copy him.\u2018Let\u2019s try again.\u2019Raon used the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 along with the \u2018Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u2019. The slow yet heavy steps looked like a fierce charging bison.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right, either.\u201dRaon shook his head and corrected his posture. He repeated over and over and over again, and he used the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 until sunrise.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dRaon frowned upon seeing the rising sun. Acquiring the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 wasn\u2019t easy, despite possessing a talent that increased his learning speed.Honestly, he felt like he was still completely clueless.\u2018No, it\u2019s probably the way it should be.\u2019The \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 was a footwork incorporating the enlightenment of Glenn, the continent\u2019s strongest man. It was natural for such martial arts to be difficult to acquire.Have you still not managed to learn that footwork, despite disturbing the King of Essence\u2019s sleep to practice? You are so pathetic that you are making me cry.Wrath came out from the bracelet and laughed at him after having been silent the whole night.The King of Essence understood it right away. I\u2019m starting to feel sorry over the human\u2019s inferiority.\u2018Okay, you\u2019re cool.\u2019Raon sighed briefly and sat down. Since his body still wasn't completely restored, he was feeling tired from practicing overnight.Pfft, it\u2019s obvious you are having difficulties. You are like a worm, crawling on the ground and trying to look up into the sky. A worm should look at the worm\u2019s sky instead.\u2018A worm should look at the worm\u2019s sky, huh\u2026\u2019Raon murmured Wrath\u2019s slander and looked at the North Grave Mountain, located behind the annex building.\u2018Now that I think about it\u2026\u2019Rimmer had told him something similar in the North Grave Mountain. When he was teaching him about the attributes, he had told him Raon needed to decide the flow of his affinity by himself.\u2018I wonder if the same goes for this footwork.\u2019Raon reexamined the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019. Glenn\u2019s \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 looked transcendental. It didn\u2019t look like a footwork that existed in reality, but a mysterious step that could jump over space and time.\u2018I\u2019m not at that level, and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to achieve.\u2019He shook his head. What he wanted to achieve was something more realistic.He had only two goals. He wanted to protect the people in the annex building, and he wanted to stab Derus Robert in the throat. That was everything he wanted.\u2018And for that\u2026\u2019Raon straightened his back and closed his eyes. He took a step while thinking about the people he needed to protect and the man he needed to kill, no matter what happened to his body.Stomp!It was a different vibration.The intense flow, starting from the mana circuit at the sole of his feet, pierced through his entire body like lightning splitting the sky. Freedom was incorporated in his body\u2019s movement.He started to draw his own picture.The picture\u2019s background was filled with the steps, incorporating the freedom that would allow him to protect his loved ones and snap the neck of his sworn enemy.Whir.Raon opened his eyes. His eyes were burning brightly, like the rising sun.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe looked down on the ground. His first step hadn\u2019t moved his body, but his mind had moved.The step was the mind, a martial art that could be only acquired by putting his mind into it.The rough sketch of the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 that he wanted to finish that day was completed at once.[You\u2019ve acquired the Supreme Harmony Steps.][Supreme Harmony Steps (One-Star) was added to traits.]Raon clenched his fists. Upon acquiring the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps' that he thought he would never manage to learn, the sense of accomplishment and exhilaration he felt was twice more than usual.[The learning speed of the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 has returned to normal.]The learning ability that helped him acquire the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 disappeared at the perfect timing, as soon as he finished learning it.Since the sun was slowly rising, the ability only lasted for a night.\u2018It was the right choice to come out to train immediately.\u2019If he didn\u2019t have that ability, he wouldn\u2019t have managed to acquire the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 even after a year, let alone in a day. Disregarding his injury to train was the correct answer.What is this\u2026?Wrath\u2019s coldness trembled violently. like a candle in the wind.What have you done? How did you do that in such a short time?\u201cYour words were the key.\u201dKey?\u201cYou told me that a worm should look at the worm\u2019s sky.\u201dSo what?\u201cJust like you said, I have my own objective, and Glenn has his own wish and objective. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t need to copy what he did exactly. I incorporated my wish in the footwork.\u201dRaon murmured that \u2018it just worked when I did that\u2019 with a cheeky expression.Even then, you shouldn\u2019t have been able to acquire that footwork so easily.\u201cYou are right. Your system was really helpful by increasing my learning speed. I\u2019m just realizing that they were both thanks to you. I\u2019m really grateful.\u201dKeuh, the King of Essence has never done that\u2026Wrath\u2019s blue coldness puffed up and looked like it could explode at any time.\u201cDon\u2019t be so angry. I was just stating the truth.\u201dRaon smiled and wagged his finger. It was as Raon was about to provoke him even more to make him burst out in anger that he heard it.\u201cRaon!\u201dSylvia came running out through the window behind the annex building. She looked as agile as Rimmer.\u201cI told you to rest! Why do you look like this?\u201d\u201cAww.\u201dRaon sighed. He wasn\u2019t scared of the monarch of devildom, but he couldn\u2019t go against his mother.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon got dragged into Sylvia\u2019s room, and she looked angrier than Wrath.\u201cRaon, what did Mom tell you?\u201d\u201cI-I wonder\u2026\u201dRaon scratched the back of his head and avoided Sylvia\u2019s gaze.\u201cI cl-ear-ly told you to stop training until you are completely recovered!\u201d\u201cM-maybe you said that\u2026\u201dHe could clearly remember her telling him that, but he turned his head and tried pretending that he didn\u2019t know anything.\u201cSeriously!\u201dSylvia wrinkled her nose with her arms crossed.\u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019Because Sylvia was scolding him, Raon felt even more uncomfortable than when he fought against the Blood Raving Demon. He couldn\u2019t understand why it was so difficult to listen to her preaching.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia leaned forward to meet his eyes. Her eyes were full of worries and sorrow. Raon lowered his head, unable to face that heavy expression.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI know why you are trying so hard to train.\u201dShe continued while caressing his shoulder.\u201cYou want to become stronger because you are worried about mom and the annex building.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s lip trembled slightly. Probably because she was his mother, or because she had spent a long time with him, Sylvia knew exactly what he was thinking.\u2018That\u2019s not all, though.\u2019No one should\u2019ve been aware that revenge was also driving his actions.\u201cThank you. And I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all Mom\u2019s fault that you have to think that way.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how happy I was when I heard you became the top trainee, won the spar, and had a great achievement during the mission. However\u2026\u201dSylvia caressed his shoulder, her mouth tightly closed.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do all that for my sake. Remember what Mom told you before: you should do what you want to do for yourself, not for our sake.\u201dShe smiled as she spoke. Her unruffled smile was proof of her sincerity, which touched his heart even more.\u201cI\u2019m telling you once again, your mom is happier than ever right now, so you don\u2019t need to strain yourself. You should walk at your own pace, Raon.\u201dOver eighty percent of his injuries were already healed. Some exercises were actually beneficial for him in his current state, and Sylvia was also aware of that fact.However, he couldn\u2019t tell her that as he faced her gaze.\u201c\u2026I got it.\u201dRaon nodded with a throbbing heart.\u201cPromise?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201dSylvia clapped her hands and stood up. She smiled brightly, unlike a moment before.\u201cEveryone, enter!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe room\u2019s door opened following her call and every maid in the annex building, including Helen, entered the room.\u201cHu-huh?\u201dRaon\u2019s jaw dropped. He was aware that the maids were standing outside, but he hadn\u2019t expected her to call them inside.\u201cYou heard, right? Report to me right away if Raon tries to train or use his body for anything.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady!\u201dThe maids smiled brightly and bowed.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon shook his head and sighed.\u201cShe got me\u2026\u201dKuhahaha! It feels so great to watch you being played with.***\u201cHuff!\u201dBurren sighed, the sound as heavy as a lump of lead.\u2018I\u2019m too distracted.\u2019He couldn\u2019t help but blush upon remembering what happened the day they fought against Eden. All he had then was a loud voice, unable to do anything.Realizing that he would\u2019ve died if Raon hadn\u2019t been there, he was too ashamed and embarrassed.\u201cI need to move my body.\u201dSince he didn\u2019t want to run into anyone, he went to the small training ground located in a corner of the annex building.Despite it being a small training ground, it was properly maintained. Burren drew his sword and swung it.Whoosh!The suffocated feeling subsided with the sound of his sword cutting through the wind. Burren kept swinging his sword, using his footwork in satisfaction.How much time had passed?When Burren came back to his senses and raised his head, a few swordsmen and trainees could be seen in the training ground.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dBurren wiped the sweat on his forehead with his sleeve and sheathed his sword.\u2018I managed to get rid of the worthless thoughts.\u2019Exercising was the correct answer, since all the distraction from before was gone.\u2018I should retu\u2026\u2019It was as he turned about to return to the Central Martial Palace that he heard them.\u201cSir Burren!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time!\u201dThey were the collateral children that didn\u2019t even go to the sixth training ground after failing the fifth training ground\u2019s exam because their pride was hurt.\u201cAre you already training after having gone through all that?\u201d\u201cAs expected of Sir Burren!\u201dThe collaterals exclaimed with glittering eyes.\u201cI just came to exercise because I was frustrated.\u201d\u201cFrustrated\u2026 Ah! I see!\u201dThe child with a wide forehead on the right narrowed his eyes and nodded.\u201cThat story was incorrect after all!\u201d\u201cWhat story?\u201d\u201cThe rumor that Raon killed the Green War Demon and fought against the Blood Raving Demon, that\u2019s a fake rumor, right?\u201d\u201cI thought the same thing. There\u2019s no way that underhanded guy would\u2019ve killed the Green War Demon and bought time for other people\u2019s escape.\u201d\u201cIt must\u2019ve been Instructor Rimmer that did all that and pretended it was all Raon\u2019s achievements. Instructor Rimmer likes him, after all.\u201dEven though Burren hadn\u2019t said anything, they were certain that Raon had lied.\u201cThat\u2019s really dirty. Those living in the annex building are all shameless\u2026\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dBurren bared his teeth and glared at the two trainees. Facing his threatening pressure, the trainees flinched and blinked.\u201cDo you think Zieghart is a ragtag that gives out accomplishment without a proper investigation?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cAh, th-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cRaon Zieghart killed the Green War Demon and didn\u2019t retreat a single step in front of the Blood Raving Demon. None of the trainees, including me, would've survived if it wasn\u2019t for him.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThreatened by Burren\u2019s growling voice, the collaterals collapsed to the ground.\u201cBring them to me if you hear anyone spouting such bullshit in the future. I\u2019ll personally close their mouths.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dBurren left the training ground after glaring at the trembling trainees.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWhile he was headed towards the Central Martial Palace, he stood still and looked up at the sky.\u2018I see.\u2019He finally realized why he felt so frustrated, and why he felt so nauseous.\u2018It\u2019s because I still couldn\u2019t accept him.\u2019He had done his best to catch up to him after realizing how much effort he had made.When he thought he had finally caught up to him, Raon was running ahead of him once again\u2014going much faster and further than him.During the matches against the Owen Kingdom, the actual battle training against the orcs, and the mission this time, Burren hadn\u2019t really managed to do anything special. Meanwhile, Raon\u2019s achievements had always been overwhelming.\u2018I was jealous\u2026\u2019Despite being silent, Raon had great leadership. He could read through all situations while also possessing an excellent might.He was saying that he would catch up to him on the outside, but he was actually jealous of his abilities on the inside.\u201cHahaha!\u201dHe burst into laughter. Jealousy was a natural emotion for a human being. He felt comfortable after realizing that fact.\u2018I wasn\u2019t that great of a person.\u2019However, he had no intention of showing that ugly feeling on the outside. He needed to keep it on the inside and use it as fuel to catch up to Raon.\u2018I told you already that I won\u2019t give up.\u2019Burren bit his lip. He returned to the Central Martial Palace with lighter steps.***\u201cYoung master, are you going to go practice by any chance?\u201dHelen walked up to Raon as soon as he left his room.\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201dRaon shook his head and walked towards the lobby.\u201cYoung master, where are you going?\u201dAnother maid examined his clothes sharply.\u201cI\u2019m going on a stroll.\u201d\u201cHmm, have a good walk.\u201dRaon waved his hand and opened the door to go outside.\u201cYoung master? No way, are you here to train\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dThe man that was cleaning the windows outside the annex building also asked him about training as soon as he saw him.\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201d\u201cTrain\u2026\u201dPeople he met on his way towards the garden behind the annex building kept asking him where he was going and what he was going to do, to an annoying extent.\u201cI\u2019m just on a stroll! A stroll!\u201dHe grimaced at the maid hanging out the laundry in the yard and ran to the garden.\u201cPhew!\u201dRaon sighed. He was completely caught in Sylvia\u2019s trap. He wouldn\u2019t have been tricked by anyone else, but he was weak against her in many ways.\u2018It\u2019ll be impossible at this rate\u2026\u2019The maids were taking the opportunity to hide everywhere and watch him.If he started using footwork in that situation, Sylvia would immediately come out like a cuckoo from a cuckoo clock.\u2018Well, fine.\u2019It was a relief that it happened after he finished acquiring the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019. It would\u2019ve been really depressing if that happened while his learning speed was increased.\u2018I guess it won\u2019t hurt to take a break once in a while.\u2019Raon relaxed, sitting on a bench in the garden. Upon realizing he wasn\u2019t going to move, the maids also stopped watching him.\u201cY-young master!\u201dAs he was enjoying the refreshing wind and the smell of the grass, a maid\u2019s voice could be heard from the annex building.\u201cWe are in trouble!\u201dRaon opened his eyes and turned his head, seeing a maid on the verge of tears running towards him.\u201cHmm?\u201dRaon stood up from the bench, hearing the maid\u2019s expression and urgent voice.\u201cS-Sir Raden Zieghart came to visit.\u201d\u201cRaden?\u201dIt was a familiar name.He was the son of Glenn\u2019s fourth son, Balder, and he apparently returned to the house recently with an achievement.\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not sure. He became violent towards my lady as soon as he arrived\u2026\u201dRaon didn\u2019t hear anything else. \u2018My lady\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019\u2014those two words were the only ones that Raon could hear.\u201cWhere is that bastard?\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes sank into darkness, just like back in the days when he was an assassin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe atmosphere in the True Martial Palace, where Glenn Zieghart\u2019s fourth son Balder Zieghart resided, was as cold as the northern ocean.The reason was simple.Balder\u2019s Zieghart\u2019s son, Raden Zieghart, had recently returned to the house. He had been in a bad mood ever since.Slam!Raden Zieghart grit his teeth and punched the wall.\u201cDamn it!\u201dHe swore in frustration.He had returned after destroying one of the White Blood Religion\u2019s branches, yet his name wasn\u2019t being praised anywhere. It was as if his achievement had been completely forgotten.And that guy was the reason behind all that. The trash living in the annex building, Raon Zieghart, whose name was spreading throughout the house.In the banquet hall, in the training ground, and even in the cafeteria\u2014everything was about Raon. Raon! Raon Zieghart, who had killed the Green War Demon, was the only thing people were talking about.\u201cThat little fly!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t control his anger. A little bug that he had never even paid attention to was overshadowing his achievements.Raden Zieghart left his room, a distorted expression of irritation on his face.\u201cAre you going out?\u201dThe butler standing in front of the door bowed and asked.\u201cWhat else do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201dRaden slammed the door and frowned.\u201cI will make the preparations. Please tell me your destina\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to the annex building.\u201d\u201cPardon? Why are you going there so suddenly?\u201dThe butler\u2019s eyes widened upon hearing that he was going to the annex building.\u201cI\u2019m going to check out how great the guy that outweighed my name looks.\u201dRaden\u2019s orange eyes flared up intensely.***While tending the garden, Judiel kept glancing to the right, where Sylvia was personally trimming a tree.\u2018This is a really strange place\u2026\u2019They weren\u2019t lacking maids, yet Sylvia often did the gardening work by herself despite being the master of the annex building.\u2018And Sylvia isn\u2019t the only strange one.\u2019Despite hiding their expressions, she could see it in the eyes of the maids working in other places. They usually worked reluctantly in order to live, yet the annex building was different.Everyone sincerely trusted each other as they happily did their tasks, and they considered Raon as their son or little brother.Judiel had lots of experiences working in different places as a spy, and the annex building was a peculiar and mysterious place among all of them.\u201cHaa.\u201dJudiel sighed, looking at the annex building.\u2018He is the most special person, though.\u2019She was still unable to forget the day she met the monster living in the annex building, when she had seen Raon Zieghart\u2019s true face. She still had nightmares about that night at least once a week.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dCold breath came from her mouth.\u2018How can such a man exist?\u2019Raon was still in his early teens. He was at an age where he should be acting like a spoiled child and complaining about food, yet his eyes looked like he wanted to kill everything in the world.Remembering the red eyes floating on the lake still gave her goosebumps.\u2018But\u2026\u2019The way Raon behaved was different from her impression of him. He acted like a shy boy towards the people in the annex building, and he treated every single maid as his family.And she wasn\u2019t an exception.Except for when he asked her about the Central Martial Palace or Karoon, he treated her the same as the other maids in the annex building. He even helped her out of her predicament recently when she was ordered to return because she was considered worthless.Judiel even wondered sometimes if she was really a double agent, and if she really had a rage worm inside of her body.\u2018He is such a great man\u2026\u2019It felt like he was on a completely different level as a person when she compared herself to him. She was just an average human being. Though, she didn\u2019t dare betray or defy him because she was too scared of him.\u201cPhew\u2026 Hmm?\u201dAs Judiel sighed quietly and was about to take care of the grass, a black shoe entered her sight.Upon raising her head, she could see a middle-aged man with his hair neatly combed back.\u2018This man is\u2026\u2019She had seen him before in the Zieghart registry. He was Merkin, the butler in charge of Raden Zieghart, belonging to the True Martial Palace.\u201cMy name is Merkin, butler from the True Martial Palace.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t bowing to Judiel, but to Sylvia behind her.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201dSylvia stepped forth, putting down the gardening shears she was holding.\u201cWe sent a letter yesterday. I came to check if you are ready.\u201d\u201cLetter? What letter are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou must\u2019ve received a letter stating that Sir Raden Zieghart wanted to visit the annex building.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t get anything like that.\u201dSylvia frowned and waved her hand.\u201cI\u2019m sure I heard they gave it to the maids in the annex building.\u201dRaden\u2019s butler, Merkin, tilted his head. He looked flustered, but his eyes were calm. Judiel was certain that he was lying.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSylvia turned around to look at the maids. Naturally, nobody knew about the letter.\u201cWhen is he coming?\u201d\u201cHe is arriving in thirty minutes.\u201d\u201cThirty minutes?\u201dHelen, who was standing behind Sylvia, widened her eyes and approached them.\u201cHow are we supposed to prepare ourselves in that short time?\u201d\u201cWe sent the letter yesterday.\u201dRaden\u2019s butler, Merkin, smiled as if he was making fun of Sylvia.\u201cWe didn\u2019t receive such a letter\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t receive one, our young master isn\u2019t really considerate about something like that. You\u2019d better prepare as fast as possible.\u201dMerkin\u2019s expression was completely laid-back. It looked like he was asking them what they could do when they were mere collaterals.A member of the direct line that was qualified as a swordsman had the same rank as a vice squad leader. It looked impossible to refuse as they were pretending to have sent a letter beforehand.Tsk.Judiel silently clicked her tongue, looking at Merkin. The reason Raden was acting dirty like that was as plain as day.Raden Zieghart had recently returned with the accomplishment of destroying a branch of the White Blood Religion, yet he was almost forgotten because of Raon\u2019s great deeds. It was obvious that he was visiting in order to vent his anger.\u2018Pathetic men.\u2019Glenn\u2019s fourth son, Balder Zieghart, and his sons all had violent personalities.Karoon and the Central Martial Palace\u2019s swordsmen were also violent, but they weren\u2019t foolish enough to make their move in public.However, the True Martial Palace was different. They straight up picked a fight and didn't hesitate to cross the lines they shouldn\u2019t. They weren\u2019t any different from bulls charging at a red cloth.\u2018This is going to be annoying.\u2019Even among Balder\u2019s children, Raden was famous for his negligence. He wasn\u2019t going to listen to Sylvia just because she was his aunt, so the situation was bound to become complicated.\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2019Raon was currently in the annex building. If Raden ever harmed Sylvia or the maids, the matter was going to escalate.\u201cHelen, it can\u2019t be helped at this point. Make the preparations and tell Raon not to come out.\u201dSylvia didn\u2019t waver despite hearing she had only thirty minutes. She stopped tending the garden and gave her orders while dusting off her clothes.Considering she mentioned Raon\u2019s name, she seemed to be aware of the reason that Raden Zieghart was visiting them.\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201dHelen bit her lip and walked towards the annex building. As Judiel was about to follow her along with the other maids, footsteps could be heard from behind her.She slowly turned her head.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *An elegant blond man wearing a full dress uniform was walking towards them. He had narrow shoulders, a rather slender body, and a long face and nose. He looked exactly like a thug in the back alley by the way he was walking with his hands in his pockets, dragging his shoes.\u2018He is already here\u2026\u2019Judiel swallowed. The guy that looked like a hoodlum was Raden Zieghart. Instead of thirty minutes that Merkin had mentioned, he had already arrived in the annex building before five minutes had even passed.\u201cOh no! The young master arrived earlier than I thought.\u201dMerkin winked with a nasty smile. As the saying goes, like master like butler.Spit!Raden Zieghart spat on a garden flower and stood in front of Sylvia.\u201cShall I call you aunt?\u201d\u201cYoung master, Lady Sylvia is at the rock bottom of the collateral hierarchy. You don\u2019t need to call her that.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t need to.\u201dRaden giggled and tapped the sword around his waist.\u201cIt\u2019s dirty even though I told you yesterday that I was going to visit. I guess it can\u2019t be helped since worthless people live here.\u201dHe trampled the garden\u2019s flowers that Sylvia and the maids had been tending with his muddy shoes. He then spat on the road in the center. It looked like it was his habit.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We are cleaning up right now.\u201dSylvia smiled at his nephew, who had reached a different level of rudeness. She was simply looking at Raden.\u201cHmph.\u201dRaden frowned in displeasure and spat on the ground once again. He came up while kicking the flowers on the right side.\u201cAre you telling me to walk on this dirty road?\u201dHe frowned, spitting at the soil covering the road.\u201cHey, clean it up right now.\u201d\u201cAlright. Please wait a moment.\u201dKeeping her smile on her face, Sylvia leaned forward to personally clean up the soil.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBoth Raden and his butler Merkin were wide-eyed at the sight. They looked like they didn\u2019t expect her to endure such provocation.\u2018Was she more amazing than I thought\u2026?\u2019Judiel narrowed her eyes. Even Judiel was angry despite being a spy that only came to the annex building recently, yet Sylvia was enduring it with a smile. Judiel admired her, realizing that Sylvia was the definition of the iron hand in a velvet glove.The maids that were helping Sylvia clean up the soil had calm expressions, but they couldn\u2019t hide the way their hands trembled in anger.The reason that they were all holding back was for Raon\u2019s sake. They were enduring Raden\u2019s provocation because they didn\u2019t want Raon to cause issues with Raden.\u201cHah, how long do I have to wait?\u201dRaden Zieghart frowned and spat once again on the soil Sylvia was cleaning up. The spit was flowing down her hand.\u201cYoung master!\u201dHelen, who was heading to the annex building, came back upon witnessing that sight. Her black eyes were hazy with anger.\u201cThat\u2019s too much! Even if you are a member of the direct line, the main building won\u2019t allow you to pick a fight like this in broad daylight!\u201dSince Helen had been with Sylvia ever since she was born, her head wasn\u2019t filled with reason but emotions coming from the long years they\u2019d spent together.\u201cH-Helen!\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dRaden pushed Sylvia, who was trying to block his way, aside and stood in front of Helen.\u201cRight. You are right. This is going to be troublesome.\u201dRaden stuck his hand out at Helen. He slapped her cheek with a smile.Slap!He didn\u2019t look like he was using much strength, yet Helen was pushed back until she hit a tree.\u201cSniff\u2026\u201dHelen trembled, grabbing her cheek.\u201cBut I\u2019m a member of the direct line of this house, which means I\u2019m the master. Even if I do something like this, or even if I kill you, a two-day probation in my room is all I\u2019m going to get.\u201dRaden\u2019s pressure increased exponentially. A chill ran down Judiel\u2019s spine, as if she were looking at a beast about to devour her.\u201cStop!\u201dAs he was about to trample on Helen, Sylvia and the maids stepped in to stop him.\u2018Eek.\u2019Judiel bit her lip and stuck next to Sylvia. She was planning to thrust herself into her to take the blow in her stead if that happened.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say stop, but \u2018please stop\u2019.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dSylvia grit her teeth. She didn\u2019t back off, facing Raden\u2019s violent pressure.Clench.Judiel clenched her fists. She was angry despite being a spy. It was as she was thinking of a way to stop that ruffian that she heard it.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dA murderous intent that made her hair stand on end burst from the annex building. She knew who it was, but she was too scared to look back.\u201cAh, the guy I was looking for finally came out.\u201dRaden spat on the ground and grinned.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dJudiel reluctantly turned her head. The man with crimson flame in his red eyes was Raon, just as she had expected. He was walking towards them with an expressionless face.Threatening pressure.She couldn\u2019t help swallowing.\u2018His murderous intent isn\u2019t weak\u2026\u2019Raon\u2019s pressure was thin. However, it wasn\u2019t because he was lacking in energy. It was because he had concentrated all his murderous intent, resulting in a small pressure.\u201cRaon Zieghart. I wanted to see that great face.\u201dWhether Raden was aware of that fact or not, he grinned and pushed Sylvia and the maids standing in front of him away.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s expression was serene. He slowly walked towards him, mouth as firmly closed as a doll\u2019s.Clank.He drew his sword when he was less than ten steps away from Raden. A clear sound rang out despite the situation.\u201cOh, are you going to swing that scary thing to me? Even though I\u2019m a member of the direct line?\u201dRaden gave a sly smile, believing that Raon would be unable to swing his sword.\u201cDirect line.\u201dRaon halted his steps and frowned.\u201cKuhaha!\u201dThinking his words were effective, Raden burst into laughter and walked towards Raon.\u201cI\u2019m Raden Zieghart, the son of the True Martial Palace\u2019s master, Balder Zieghart\u2026\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dRaon\u2019s sword stormed down at Raden like red lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Raden Zieghart smiled broadly upon arriving at the annex building. Soil was everywhere on the road because Sylvia and the maids in the annex building were tending the garden.\u2018It\u2019s perfect for picking a fight.\u2019The butler Merkin, who went before him, must\u2019ve talked to them about the letter he never sent.Since it wasn\u2019t cleaned up despite a member of the direct line visiting them, there were countless ways to mess with them.\u2018Until he comes out.\u2019He was visiting that small and dirty place in order to humiliate Raon Zieghart and make him kneel. He was going to keep provoking him until he started fighting him.Sylvia approached him. Her eyes were calm despite knowing that he was there to cause a scene.Raden laughed at the woman that would\u2019ve been his aunt if she stayed in the house, provoking her.However, her reaction was dull. Even though he spoke to her rudely, spat at her and trampled on the carefully raised flowers with his dirty shoes, she didn\u2019t yield to his provocations.Sylvia\u2019s patience exceeded his expectations, and her expression was too calm\u2014to the point that it was scary.\u2018Damn it\u2026\u2019Raden\u2019s mouth became thinned. Directly attacking Sylvia could be dangerous, even for him.\u2018I can\u2019t return like this.\u2019As he was thinking about what to do, he noticed the maids cleaning up the soil with Sylvia. Their expressions were composed, but they couldn\u2019t hide their trembling hands.\u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019He got a grasp on how he could provoke her, since the maids couldn\u2019t control their minds as well as Sylvia.Caw, spit!Raden grinned and spat on Sylvia\u2019s hand as she was cleaning up the ground. The oldest maid flipped out upon seeing that.\u201cThat\u2019s too much! Even if you are a member of the direct line, the main building won\u2019t allow you to pick a fight like this in broad daylight!\u201dJust as he expected, she was successfully provoked and said things she shouldn\u2019t have.Slap!Pushing away Sylvia as she tried to stop him, Raden walked up to the maid and slapped her cheek.Just as she said, the department of justice wouldn\u2019t let the matter slide, but probation was all he was going to get since he was a member of the direct line.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know your place. You are nothing but trash in this house.\u201dHe giggled. It was as he was about to trample on the trembling maid that it happened.With threatening pressure, a boy appeared from the annex building. His facial features were so serene that they could be called perfect.\u2018That bastard is Raon Zieghart\u2026\u2019He became even more irritated upon seeing his handsome face.Clank.Raon drew his sword.\u2018There\u2019s no way a brat that can\u2019t even control his murderous intent would\u2019ve killed the Green War Demon and fought against the Blood Raving Demon. How laughable.\u2019Raon stopped walking right under his nose. He only sneered despite having seen him drawing his sword, since there was no way he would swing it.\u201cOh, are you going to swing that scary thing to me? Even though I\u2019m a member of the direct line?\u201dHis eyes looked like he was still retaining his sanity. As he was about to provoke him even more, Raon opened his mouth.\u201cSo what?\u201dEven before the word reached his ears, a red light sparked in front of his eyes.He gasped. He tried to step back in shock, but it was too late. His sword was already dashing towards his neck.Crash!He didn\u2019t know what to do and closed his eyes. A powerful crashing sound could be heard from right in front of him.When he opened his eyes, he saw his butler Merkin defending him.However, Raon didn\u2019t stop. Without missing the opportunity created by Merkin being unable to completely nullify the shock, he thrust his fist.Crack!Merkin collapsed backward upon receiving a direct hit to his temple, his body trembling.\u201cY-you crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cDo you realize who you have just attacked?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201dRaon\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t trembling in the slightest. He was seriously intending to kill him.\u201cYou are a robber that trespassed into my territory.\u201d\u201cBullshit! I\u2019m the real master of this house!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t your house.\u201dHe swung his sword again while spewing more lunacy.\u201cFine! I was just going to play around, but I\u2019ll rip your head off now!\u201dRaden thrust his sword. He was planning to deflect Raon\u2019s sword and pierce his neck.However, a mysterious rotation emerged from Raon\u2019s sword and pushed back his sword instead.\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201dHe barely managed to deflect Raon\u2019s blow by twisting his sword while stepping back.Whoosh!As if Raon was expecting it, he approached him and slashed diagonally.\u201cKeuh!\u201dRaden groaned. His hand was trembling from blocking Raon\u2019s blow. It was difficult to regain his advantage one he started losing.\u201cH-how dare you attack a member of the direct line! You and your mother will be punished to death!\u201d\u201cI just need to behead you before that happens.\u201dA threatening strike grazed his shoulder while he said that.Clank!He barely managed to block the sword aimed at his neck.\u201cKeuh!\u201dWhat the hell is this guy?!There was no opening in Raon\u2019s swordsmanship as it stormed at him like a tidal wave. Even though the provocation had certainly worked, Raden was the one that was being disrupted.\u2018Damn it!\u2019He wanted to gather his aura from his energy center to counterattack, but Raon wasn\u2019t giving him the time to do that. He had no choice but to defend until the end.\u2018Time, I just need time!\u2019If only he had the time to use his aura, he could kill a guy like that in an instant. And that was why he wasn\u2019t giving him any time at all.Raden gritted his teeth.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped!\u2019He needed to escape, even if he would be injured in the process. He forcefully gathered the aura from his energy center while blocking Raon\u2019s sword.Rumble!It felt extremely painful, as if his mana circuit was being burned out, but a powerful aura surrounded his body.\u201cIt\u2019s over! You crazy bastard!\u201dPuffing up the muscles of his lower and upper body, he attacked with his aura gathered on his blade. The strike was powerful enough to cut through Raon and his sword at once.However, Raon disappeared from his sight right before the blow hit him.\u201cGasp!\u201dIt felt like he was hallucinating. He couldn\u2019t even begin to grasp where he was gone.\u201cYou are the one that\u2019s finished.\u201dHe got goosebumps upon hearing Raon\u2019s voice from behind him. He quickly turned around, but his fist was already touching his abdomen.Slam!He was bent double at the powerful shock.\u201cYou.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201dRaon\u2019s sword was rushing towards his heart.\u201cUaaah!\u201dTerrified by the blade thrust at him like a ray of light, Raden closed his eyes and screamed.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Raon couldn\u2019t pierce Raden\u2019s heart. He stopped his sword right before he reached his chest.There were two reasons.First, Sylvia was shouting at him to stop, and the second\u2026Was because there were two swordsmen from the Heavenly Blade Division, under the head of house\u2019s direct command, standing in front of Raden.\u201cDid you finally come out despite having done nothing when Helen was being beaten?\u201dThe Heavenly Blade\u2019s swordsmen didn\u2019t react despite Raon\u2019s threatening voice.\u201cPlease step back.\u201dThey lowered their posture, expressing their intention to protect Raden and hardened the wall.\u201cHuaaah!\u201dRealizing he had survived, Raden fell to the back. He pointed his finger at Raon while drooling.\u201cK-kill him! Kill that crazy bastard!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?! That mutt attacked me, a member of the direct line!\u201dThe Heavenly Blade swordsmen didn\u2019t move despite Raden\u2019s order. They were just standing still, like statues.\u201cMove aside.\u201d\u201cPlease step back.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon gathered his aura and steamed out between his teeth. The Heavenly Blade\u2019s swordsmen were different from Raden\u2019s butler. They weren\u2019t opponents he could win against with a surprise attack.\u201cRaon, stop!\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201dAs he was about to use the\u00a0Ten Flames\u00a0of the\u00a0Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation, Sylvia and Helen came up to him and grabbed his arms. The anger filling his head and heart melted away like snow in the spring upon seeing their wavering eyes.\u201cY-you damn bastards! Do you realize who I am?\u201dRaden screamed and stood up.\u201cI\u2019m the True Martial Palace Master\u2019s son! Kill that bastard! No, I\u2019m killing him! Get out of my way!\u201d\u201cYoung master Raden, please step back.\u201dThe Heavenly Blade swordsman on the right turned around to stop Raden. They were separating Raon and Raden.\u201cWe only listen to the head of house\u2019s command. Please step back, both of you.\u201d\u201cKeuh, you are just dogs guarding the house! I was beaten up by him!\u201dRaden grit his teeth and raised his sword. As he was about to attack the Heavenly Blade\u2019s swordsman using all his aura, his butler Merkin\u2014who had been unconscious\u2014ran up to him and grabbed his shoulder.\u201cY-young master, please stop!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dThe way he was grinding his teeth and rampaging resembled a rabid dog.\u201cYoung master, this is rather\u2026\u201dMerkin whispered to Raden and he slowly stopped swinging his limbs.\u201cLet me go.\u201dRaden pushed Merkin away and met Raon\u2019s eyes past the Heavenly Blade swordsmen.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dHis eyes glowed like those of a beast.\u201cI\u2019m going to make you experience humiliation and pain worse than death! Just you wait.\u201d\u201cSame goes for me.\u201dCrimson lightning sparked from Raon\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019m never going to forget what you did here. You\u2019d better fix your habit of closing your eyes when you are scared, since your head could get sent flying at any time.\u201d\u201cKeuh! You damn insect! You would\u2019ve already been six feet under if it wasn\u2019t for that surprise attack!\u201dRaden burned in lunacy and tried to pounce at him, but he could only flounder his limbs around, blocked by Merkin.\u201cY-young master! We have to leave now!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never forgive you! I\u2019ll destroy the annex building itself!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201dMerkin left the annex building, forcefully dragging Raden out.The Heavenly Blade swordsmen relaxed from their defensive posture a long time after Raden and Merkin had left, then walked up to Raon.\u201cThis matter will be reported to the head of house. You should prepare an explanation.\u201d\u201cIs that advice? I thought you didn\u2019t care about anyone other than the direct line.\u201d\u201cRaon, stop.\u201dSylvia\u2019s hand, holding his right arm, tightened. Raon clicked his tongue and sheathed his sword.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Blade swordsmen didn\u2019t respond, silently leaving after bowing.\u201cMy lady, young master. I-I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t hold myself back, despite my age\u2026\u201dHelen knelt in front of Raon and Sylvia.\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You gave me so much courage just by stepping up.\u201dSylvia looked like all her strength was gone, but she made Helen stand with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s not Helen\u2019s fault.\u201dRaon nodded. The source of the problem was still shamelessly existing, so there was no reason for her to apologize for doing nothing wrong.\u201cRaon.\u201dSylvia hugged Raon from behind.\u201cYou\u2019ve become really strong. I felt really reassured when you stood in front of Mom.\u201dHer voice was both laughing and crying at the same time.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this matter. Mom will take care of it.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201dHe turned around, trying to stop her, but he couldn\u2019t speak because Sylvia was grabbing his shoulder tightly.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, just trust your mom.\u201dAfter saying that, Sylvia started to clean up the dirty ground, the trampled flowers and grass. Her peaceful expression was making the color return to the frightened maids\u2019 faces.\u2018She is strong.\u2019Sylvia should\u2019ve been the most anxious of them all, yet she was reassuring the others instead. Her heart was sturdier than anyone there, either because she was a mother or because she was strong to begin with.\u2018However.\u2019Raon closed his eyes while cleaning up the dirty areas with Sylvia.\u2018I have to solve this problem.\u2019His experience and instincts were telling him the same thing. He was the one who could solve the issue, not Sylvia.\u2018And\u2026\u2019He had no intention of letting that bastard off the hook after he insulted Sylvia and hit Helen.Whir.No one noticed, but Raon\u2019s crimson eyes were shining more intensely than ever.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Raon returned to his room after finishing cleaning up the garden and looking after Sylvia, Helen, and all the maids.Knock knock.Once he finished changing his dirty clothes, a quiet knocking sound could be heard.\u201cEnter.\u201dJudiel opened the door and entered, then bowed her head.\u201cExplain the situation.\u201d\u201cYes. While we were tending the garden with my lady, Raden Zieghart\u2019s butler, Merkin, visited us. He said he had sent a letter saying that they would visit us today and asked us about the preparation\u2026\u201dShe reported what happened without missing a single detail, from Merkin to Raden.\u201c\u2026And Sir Raon arrived as Sir Raden was about to trample on Madam Helen.\u201dJudiel bowed as she finished speaking.\u201cI see.\u201dRaon nodded. Her description wasn\u2019t much different from what he expected.\u201cBy the way, Sir Raon.\u201dJudiel raised her head and called Raon\u2019s name.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit awkward for me to say this, but Sir Raon shouldn\u2019t have interfered today. Raden and his father, Balder Zieghart, are people who don\u2019t consider the consequences.\u201dHer expression was as stiff as tree bark.\u201cI\u2019m sure they are going to attack the annex building and Sir Raon using various methods. Even though Raden offended us first, they are members of the direct line, and we are collaterals. It\u2019s perfectly obvious whose side the house is going to take.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRaon didn\u2019t open his mouth and watched Judiel until she finished speaking.\u201cIf you think I\u2019m overstepping my bounds\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dRaon shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m grateful to you.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou tried taking Raden\u2019s kick instead of Helen and my mother.\u201dJudiel was sticking right next to Sylvia and Helen when Raden raised his foot, shoving her body into it.She was trying to get kicked instead of the others. Even Judiel herself didn\u2019t think she would do that.\u201cThat was unintentional\u2026\u201dJudiel blushed and lowered her head. Losing to affection as a spy was such a laughable thing to do.\u2018But\u2026\u2019The people in the annex building were the only ones that had treated her as a human being, despite being Zieghart\u2019s smallest and most persecuted place. It couldn\u2019t be helped that she felt affection towards them, even though she was still afraid of Raon.\u201cYou are right. It would\u2019ve been best to not yield to his provocation, but it already happened. I have my plans against him, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201dSince Raon said she didn\u2019t need to worry, she felt like her upset stomach was eased entirely.That was how much trust his voice filled her with. However, she was still worried about something.\u2018This is troublesome.\u2019It seemed she took more of a liking to the annex building\u2019s residents than she thought.\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d\u201cGather information about Raden and Balder. Things like their personalities and their achievements so far.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dShe bowed her head then left the room.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon licked his lips, looking at the closed door.\u2018That was unexpected.\u2019Judiel\u2019s emotions towards Raon were those of fear and doubt, yet she was fond of the people in the annex building. It looked like even she wasn\u2019t sure about her emotions.It looked like he could easily obtain her sincerity if he kept looking after her in the annex building.However, he felt a bit guilty about continuing to lie to her after witnessing her trying to protect Sylvia and Helen.\u201cBut that\u2019s not important right now.\u201dRaon raised his clenched fist. He wasn\u2019t actually planning to confront Raden in the beginning.Since he had already expected it to happen, he had planned to grasp the situation first, then crush him with words.However, his mind went blank when Sylvia and Helen were about to be struck, and that bastard\u2019s face was the only thing that entered his sight.\u2018Wrath\u2026\u2019That was right.He couldn\u2019t control his emotion, boiling with an unbearable wrath.The funny part was that he remained calmer than ever concerning the fight. It was a mysterious emotion in various ways.\u201cA strange mixture of wrath and reason.\u201dYou are well aware of it.Wrath burst from the bracelet with an excited voice.\u201cWas that your doing, after all?\u201dWhat are you talking about?\u201cI\u2019m talking about when I couldn\u2019t control my wrath.\u201dNo, no. That was your fault.Wrath grinned from inside the cold flame.\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was the effect of the wrath that you have accepted before.\u201cBut I\u2019m usually\u2026\u201dDo you usually go crazy with anger?\u201cOf course not.\u201dThe same goes for the King of Essence\u2019s emotions. It\u2019s usually calm, yet it will pierce into you and try to control you the moment you get angry.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dRaon bit his lip. The trade with that self-proclaimed king was more dangerous than he thought. He resolved to never accept his emotion again.Do you think that is possible?Wrath smiled, realizing his thought.Humans are weak in various ways. And the same goes for you, who the King of Essence deems somewhat special.\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dYou aren\u2019t going to make any request despite, having a god who can grant your wish right next to you, huh? How laughable. You are going to ask the King of Essence for a trade, whether it is for your own sake or for the others, and eventually\u2026He smiled without finishing his sentence, but Raon could make a guess.\u201cI will never give my body to you.\u201dThe King of Essence can already see the future where you offer your body on your own accord. It\u2019s already too late.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled and used the\u00a0Ring of Fire. The feeling of refreshing water running through his veins cleared his mind.It was more dangerous to get emotional than taking on Wrath\u2019s attacks. He needed to keep his cool no matter what.Hmph.Raon calmed his emotions with\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0and Wrath returned to the bracelet, murmuring that it was no fun.\u2018The\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0really is important.\u2019What he needed to defend himself against Wrath wasn\u2019t a sword or a spear, but the\u00a0Ring of Fire. It was necessary to level it up as quickly as possible.Raon cultivated the\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0overnight, and a knocking sound could be heard once again.\u201cThis is the information on Balder and Raden that you requested.\u201dAs Raon opened the door, Judiel handed over a thin stack of documents. Considering the ink on it was still not dried, it seemed she had written it personally.\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be leaving, then\u2026\u201dJudiel bowed and left.Raon checked her documents from the beginning to the end in one sitting.\u2018This is quite\u2026\u2019Raon exclaimed.The document was made on the spot, yet it was well organized. All the information he currently needed, including Raden and Balder\u2019s personalities and temperaments, were all written down.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty useful.\u201dIt looked like he could use her as an informant if she couldn\u2019t be a double agent anymore.Raon read the documents over and over while rotating the\u00a0Ring of Fire.The night passed as such, and once the sun rose a third knock sounded on his door.When he opened the door, he found Sylvia with wavering eyes and Glenn\u2019s butler, Roenn.\u201cR-Raon.\u201d\u201cYoung master, please excuse me so early in the morning.\u201dRoenn bowed with an unusually cold expression.\u201cThe head of house has summoned the young master.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Raon went to the lord\u2019s manor, leaving Sylvia\u2014who was persistently trying to follow him\u2014behind.\u201cYoung master.\u201dRoenn turned when he was in front of the steps to the lord\u2019s manor. His eyes were filled with curiosity as he looked at him.\u201cYou must be aware of the reason that the head of house has summoned you. Aren\u2019t you anxious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware of the reason, naturally. However, I\u2019m not really anxious.\u201dRaon shook his head with composed eyes.\u201cI see.\u201dRoenn smiled lightly and entered the lord\u2019s manor. It might have been his imagination, but he looked satisfied with his answer.As he entered the lord\u2019s manor behind Roenn, a heavy atmosphere weighed down on him. It felt like gravity had grown twice as strong in that place.Raon breathed slowly, just like when he was meditating. The heaviness pressuring his shoulders subsided slightly.The swordsmen and servants looked at him with indescribable gazes, but Raon proudly stood in front of the audience chamber.\u201cThey are also in there, on top of the head of house. Are you ready?\u201dRaon\u00a0nodded plainly at Roenn\u2019s question.\u201cI\u2019m opening the door.\u201dHe signaled the guard with his gaze, and the audience chamber\u2019s door started to open.There were three people under the radiant lighting of the audience chamber.Glenn Zieghart was sitting at the throne on the platform, exuding an overwhelming pressure. And the two men standing under him were Raden Zieghart and his father, Balder Zieghart.Unlike Raden, Balder had a thick body with wide shoulders. Raon wouldn\u2019t have thought of them as father and son if he didn\u2019t know their names. However, he had the same nasty eyes as his son.Raden was glaring at him as if he wanted to kill him, and Balder frowned as if he was looking at an insect.\u201cGreeting my lord.\u201dRaon ignored their gazes, walking up to the center and kneeling.\u201cRise.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dStrength almost left his legs upon hearing his icy voice, but he grit his teeth and stood up.He stepped back to stand in the same line as Balder and Raden, then looked up at Glenn.\u201cI heard an unsavory event happened yesterday.\u201dHe raised his chin from the hand it had been resting on, looking down on everyone with indifferent eyes.\u201cMy lord! I will explain!\u201dRaden stepped forward and knelt.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dUpon receiving Glenn\u2019s permission, Raden looked back at Raon and grinned.\u201cUpon returning to the house after a long time, I noticed news about Raon was spread everywhere. Since I had never spoken to him before despite having seen him a few times, I sent a letter to the annex building beforehand. I went to the annex building at the designated date, but they hadn\u2019t made any preparations. Instead, their garden was in a complete mess\u2014as if they wanted to throw away their guest.\u201dRaden wrinkled his nose as if he felt really mortified from the experience.\u201cI felt bitter and raised my voice a little, and the annex building\u2019s maids immediately started nitpicking my behavior. Raon appeared when the voices started getting louder, and immediately swung his sword at me without saying anything. It wasn\u2019t a diversion or a threat\u2014he really was trying to kill me. I kept defending while controlling my strength, but his sword was aimed at my throat until the very end.\u201dRaden\u2019s voice sounded realistic enough to make people believe that he was the victim.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dGlenn hadn\u2019t changed in the slightest, despite hearing Raden\u2019s emotional voice. He called Raon with the exact same voice as before.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRaon shook his head with composed eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s not a single truth from the beginning to the end. Especially the part about him controlling his strength\u2014it\u2019s laughable. The sight of him turning red to shout at me still lingers before my eyes.\u201d\u201cUgh! You damn bastard!\u201dRaden grabbed his shoulder, but Raon didn\u2019t look back.\u201cYoung master Raden.\u201dRoenn\u2019s eyes, as he stood back on the left side, grew as threatening as a blade.\u201cDid you perhaps forget whose presence you are standing in?\u201d\u201cKeuh!\u201dRaden swallowed and took his hand off Raon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIf the two peoples\u2019 testimonies are different, then I shall call the witness that saw everything.\u201dGlenn flicked his finger, looking at Raden and Raon. A black shape came down in front of Raon with a thud.\u201cRakael from the Heavenly Blade division is greeting my lord!\u201d\u201cReport what happened yesterday.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Heavenly Blade swordsman that introduced himself as Rakael was the man who had blocked Raon\u2019s sword the day before. He stood up after nodding, then started speaking.\u201cYoung master Raden said he sent a letter beforehand, but such a letter had never arrived at the annex building. Lady Sylvia was tending the garden like always along with her maids\u2026\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes. Rakael was telling him the truth without a single lie, despite his expectations.\u201cRaden Zieghart.\u201dGlenn frowned after hearing the whole story from Rakael.\u201cAh! Yes, yes!\u201dRaden trembled and rammed his head against the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s quite different from what you said.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cFather.\u201dAs Raden trembled, unable to say anything, Balder\u2014who had just been watching until then\u2014frowned and stepped forward.\u201cThat\u2019s not the important part right now. The biggest problem of this incident is the fact that a collateral swung his sword at a member of the direct line. This endangers the house\u2019s hierarchy itself!\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s right! He tried to kill me with his sword!\u201dRaden nodded violently upon finding an opening.\u201cThat\u2019s true. A collateral\u2019s attack against a member of the direct line isn\u2019t just a matter of bad manners. However.\u201dGlenn nodded and stood up from the throne. His presence exploded like a giant\u2019s stretching.\u201cWhat do you think the difference between direct line and collateral is?\u201d\u201cPardon? Th-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's the responsibility. Zieghart\u2019s direct line has to bear the responsibility as the true master of the house.\u201dThe entire lord\u2019s manor started trembling at the yellow energy flowing out from his shoulders.\u201cYou must remember that you are Zieghart\u2019s master in every single action and every single word you speak. It\u2019s the same even when you want to tease or degrade a collateral. If that\u2019s your intention, you have to thoroughly trample upon them until the very end. However, you had your life threatened by a collateral, and a child younger than you on top of that.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s not true. Raon\u2019s head would\u2019ve already been separated from his body if that was my intention!\u201d\u201cShame on you! You shall shut your mouth if you were saved by others twice in a row.\u201d\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dFacing Glenn\u2019s freezing gaze as it gave him goosebumps, Raden grit his teeth.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to realize your own position either. You are a collateral, which means you need to be careful about your behavior. Swinging your sword at a member of the direct line with a swordsman\u2019s qualification is the same as a dog biting its owner. If you received unfair treatment, you should\u2019ve informed the main building instead of trying to solve it by yourself.\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dRaon closed his eyes and lowered his head.\u201cSince there was a problem with both of you, I\u2019m going to punish each of you accordingly.\u201d\u201cFather! You can\u2019t just punish him! You shouldn\u2019t let him live. He is going to bare his fangs against the direct line one day! You need to execute him immediately!\u201dBalder Zieghart stepped forward once again. He raised his voice, pointing his finger at Raon.\u201cSilence.\u201d\u201cIf you overlook this incident, the structure between the direct line and collateral will collapse and the house\u2019s reputation will be\u2026\u201d\u201cBalder, I told you to shut your mouth.\u201d\u201cKeuh!\u201dFacing Glenn\u2019s voice crushing the space, it looked like Balder\u2019s huge body was squashed for a moment.\u201cMy lord.\u201dIn the midst of the atmosphere squeezing his heart, Raon raised his head to look at Glenn. He lowered his head and called his name.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI will accept any punishment you deem fit. However, I still have something to do before that.\u201d\u201cSomething to do?\u201d\u201cYes. Raden Zieghart insulted my mother and used violence against the maids. I still haven\u2019t made him pay for that.\u201d\u201cYou crazy bastard! The same goes for me! I still remember you swinging your sword with those rabid red eyes! I'll definitely cut your head off!\u201d\u201cRaon Zieghart, Raden Zieghart.\u201dGlenn called Raon and Raden\u2019s names with serious eyes. Crushing pressure was emanating from his entire body.\u201cI just told you to know your place.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s the reason why.\u201dRaon grit his teeth and straighten his back.\u201cThe head of house referred to this place as the swordsman's ground. I think a warrior should prove his worth with his sword.\u201dRaon\u2019s determined voice resounded throughout the lord\u2019s manor.\u201cI request a Sword Duel!\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91A Sword Duel.Just as the name implied, it was a duel using swords. However, there were two additional rules.The first was that both participants needed a swordsman's qualification, and the second was that they needed to set the conditions the opponent needed to fulfill upon victory.Raon thought the Sword Duel was the best way of resolving the situation.\u201cYou want to settle this in the swordsman's way, since this is the swordsman\u2019s ground?\u201dGlenn\u2019s powerful pressure subsided as he nodded.\u201cIndeed, I did mention such a thing. That\u2019s not wrong.\u201d\u201cM-my lord! I would like to request the same thing!\u201dWithout missing the opportunity, Raden clapped his hands and stepped forward.\u201cI also need to pay him back. Please allow us to have a Sword Duel!\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was an unexpected situation, but Balder seemed to think it was better to have a Sword Duel, as he stepped back and shut his mouth.\u201cRaon Zieghart. The fact that you suggested the Sword Duel must mean that you are confident in your victory, right?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dRaon nodded confidently.\u201cRaden Zieghart.\u201dGlenn\u2019s gaze was directed at Raden this time.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cAccording to the report, I heard you kept losing to Raon from the beginning to the end. Are you confident in your victory in the rematch?\u201d\u201cO-of course! I was just taken off guard as I didn\u2019t expect him to start attacking. I\u2019ll show you an overwhelming victory if we can have another fight!\u201dRaden nodded his head like a woodpecker pecking a tree.\u201cThat sounds entertaining.\u201dThe corners of Glenn\u2019s mouth were raised slightly, which was a rare sight.\u201cRaden, what condition do you want to impose?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll destroy Raon Zieghart\u2019s energy center and break his mana circuits.\u201d\u201cMana circuit and energy center?\u201d\u201cYes, both of them!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll allow it.\u201dIt was a frightening condition, yet Glenn\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all.\u201cThank you!\u201dRaden\u2019s face became as bright as the magical light.\u201cRaon Zieghart.\u201dYes.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do if you win the Sword Duel?\u201d\u201cI want Raden Zieghart and his butler to kneel and apologize to my mother and the maids, and give material compensation. I also want no one related to the True Martial Palace to get near the annex building.\u201d\u201cApology and prohibiting access. I\u2019ll allow that as well.\u201d\u201cFather! Apology concerns Raden, but the access prohibition concerns the entirety True Martial Palace. It exceeds the rights of a Sword Duel\u2026\u201d\u201cBalder.\u201dGlenn\u2019s red eyes were directed at Balder, who lowered his eyes to the ground as if he had just looked at the sun.\u201cThis is your final warning.\u201d\u201cI-I apologize.\u201dBalder stepped back and lowered his head.Whir.Maintaining his storming pressure, Glenn looked at Raon and Raden one after another.\u201cI\u2019ve allowed the conditions from both of you. The Sword Duel will be held in one week at the great training ground.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dRaon and Raden bowed at once.\u201cThe discussion is over. You shall leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSince Raon had said all that he wanted to say, he left the audience chamber.\u201cA Sword Duel, huh. You are taking our side in the end.\u201dBalder stepped forward and smiled.\u201cEven if he is a talented son of Sylvia, he is still a collateral. We will show the clear difference between a member of the direct line and a collateral. Raden, I\u2019m sure you can do it, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. I became an intermediate level Expert through this mission. I only need one hand to win against a guy that has just reached novice level Expert.Raden and Balder narrowed their eyes and smiled, the exact same way. They truly were a father and his son.\u201cHow about just killing him during the Sword Duel? It will prevent the arrogant collateral guys\u2019 rudeness in the future.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not a good idea as everyone will be watching. It\u2019s better to disable him and destroy his hopes. Mother and son both becoming disabled, with their energy center and mana circuit destroyed, sounds great. Just imagine it.\u201dBalder giggled\u2014as if malice was the only thing he had towards Sylvia and Raon, who were actually his little sister and his nephew.\u201cCertainly, that\u2019s the case.\u201dRaden nodded his head with a smile. The father and son were talking as if he had already won the Sword Duel and Raon was in the palm of his hand.\u201cYou shall return as well.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSee you again in a week.\u201dRaden and Balder left the audience chamber, brimming with smiles.\u201cMy lord.\u201dRoenn finally stood in front of Glenn after everyone had left.\u201cYoung master Raon is a novice level Expert, and the young master Raden is already an intermediate level Expert. Isn\u2019t it going to be dangerous since their levels are clearly different?\u201dRoenn\u2019s voice was lower than usual since he had taken a liking to Raon.\u201cA swordsman's fight isn\u2019t decided simply by their levels or the techniques they have learned. The nature of the person is the most important factor.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware of that fact as well, but\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true that there is a difference in level between them. However, Raon\u2019s eyes were peaceful. They were filled with confidence, which was different from the arrogance or overconfidence of fighting against an opponent he had already won against. How can I not trust him after seeing those eyes?\u201dGlenn smiled gently, unlike earlier. It was the warm gazes of a grandfather watching his grandson being cute.\u2018Moreover\u2026\u2019Unlike Raden, Raon\u2019s conditions were for the sake of his family, with nothing about his own protection or compensation for himself. He was more likable the more he saw him.\u201cRoenn.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUse any excuse to decrease the True Martial Palace\u2019s budget next month in half. Retrieve all the missions they took as well.\u201d\u201cThere is going to be backlash.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Tell them to come to me if they have a problem.\u201d\u201cHmm, understood.\u201dRoenn bowed his head, then looked up at Glenn. It was rare to see his eyes contain anger.\u2018I guess it\u2019s natural since they touched his sore finger.\u2019Sylvia and Raon were Glenn\u2019s sore finger. It looked like he couldn\u2019t forgive them, even though they were his other fingers.\u2018He looks like he is returning to the way he was before.\u2019Roenn smiled, hiding his face. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling because Glenn looked like a grandfather taking revenge on the guy who hit his grandson.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Sylvia and the maids were outside the annex building when Raon returned.\u201cWhy are you outside?\u201d\u201cH-how did it go?\u201dSylvia\u2019s hands, which were gathered in front of her chest, were trembling. Even though she was strong when it concerned herself, she looked nervous when it was about her son.\u201cWe are going to have a Sword Duel in a week.\u201d\u201cS-Sword Duel?\u201d\u201cNo way! A Sword Duel?\u201dSylvia and Helen grabbed Raon\u2019s shoulders and shook him.\u201cI\u2019m going to have a Sword Duel against Raden Zieghart.\u201d\u201cWhat? What did you just say?\u201d\u201cNo, what even happened for a Sword Duel\u2026\u201dTheir eyes were wavering like a sailboat on a river. The maids also gasped, unable to close their mouths.\u201cI had many considerations, but a Sword Duel is the best solution.\u201dRaon declared, meeting Sylvia\u2019s eyes.\u201cIt can\u2019t be any better.\u201dThe enemy was a member of the direct line, and they were collateral.Getting Glenn\u2019s acknowledgment was the only way of preventing them from harming the annex building, on top of making Raden apologize.\u201cBut Raon, what you saw that day wasn\u2019t Raden at his best.\u201dSylvia came up to him and grabbed his hand. The trembling of her hand passed on to his wrist.\u201cBrother Balder\u2019s weapon is a flexible sword. Raden also must\u2019ve learned a technique to handle flexible swords. He is going to be a completely different person once he reveals his true strength!\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s true, young master. The True Martial Palace\u2019s techniques are famous for their ever-changing nature. You can\u2019t take it easy on this matter. He must be stronger than the Green War Demon that the young master defeated!\u201d\u201cHe is not going to be careless this time, and your injuries aren\u2019t completely healed yet! I can\u2019t allow this. I\u2019m going to Father! If I plead to him now\u2026\u201d\u201cMom.\u201dRaon grabbed Sylvia\u2019s shoulder after she let his hand go, about to run to the main building.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Trust me.\u201dNoticing his slight smile, Sylvia\u2014about to start running\u2014turned around.\u201cThe head of house taught me something.\u201d\u201cF-Father did?\u201d\u201cYes. I can win against him if I use that.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll nullify the promise with Mom about forbidding my training.\u201dAfter saying that, Raon went inside the annex building. Sylvia was standing there blankly, unable to stop Raon.\u201cMy lady, e-even if the head of house taught him something, shouldn\u2019t you stop the young master?\u201dHelen swallowed, standing next to Sylvia.\u201cI was going to, but I felt relieved for some reason upon seeing Raon\u2019s eyes.\u201d\u201cUhm, actually, the same thing happened to me\u2026\u201dHelen nodded, telling her that she felt the same thing.\u201cBut we can\u2019t just stand here doing nothing. Let\u2019s find anything we can do for Raon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe maids all nodded in unison. Judiel\u2019s eyes shone as she looked at the annex building that Sylvia and Raon had entered.***Raon changed into his training outfit in his room, then went to the annex building\u2019s open area. The maids kept glancing at him as they passed, but he didn\u2019t pay attention to them.\u2018What\u2019s important right now is the Sword Duel.\u2019The rumor about the Sword Duel was going to spread quickly. Since he had already attracted attention, it was better to receive even more attention so that the True Martial Palace couldn\u2019t try anything funny.That was why he needed to win the Sword Duel, and with an overwhelming difference on top of it.\u201cFlexible sword, huh\u2026\u201dFlexible swords were, as the name suggested, swords that were flexible.They might simply have a higher elasticity, but some flexible swords could bend freely like whips. As such, there were a wide variety of flexible swords.The True Martial Palace\u2019s swordsmen were people that were capable of combining those flexible swords with flashy techniques.The higher the swordsman\u2019s abilities, the more the flexible swords could bend. A powerful flexible sword user could even create a wall with the sword.\u2018I\u2019m sure Raden\u2019s sword is also extremely elastic.\u2019Since he was the son of the True Martial Palace master, famous for the flexible sword, Raden\u2019s technique should be also on a different level from the common flexible swordsmanship.However, he couldn\u2019t imagine himself losing.He had learned the \u2018Supreme Harmony Steps\u2019 Glenn had taught him personally, and he had already experienced assassinating an excellent flexible swordsman.Whether Raden used a flexible sword or he was an intermediate level Expert didn\u2019t matter at all to Raon.Clang!Raon unwrapped the bandage Sylvia forced on him and drew his sword.Slashing with the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword, he stepped with the\u00a0River Footwork. His movement was flowing as smoothly as a single line, which could already be considered complete.Upon performing the last form of the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword,\u00a0Raon\u2019s movement differed from the River Footwork. He extended his left foot instead of his right foot and kicked the ground.Clank!Raon\u2019s body became as blurry as dust at that instant, and he reappeared three steps ahead like lightning. Even if a person watched him, they would\u2019ve seen him disappear then reappear.Whoosh!Raon slashed his sword. The strike separating the space was an aura blade that seemed capable of cutting through anything.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled and stopped his sword.\u2018This is the\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps.\u2019The\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps\u00a0wasn't simply footwork.It was a special footwork that could be mixed in between other footworks\u00a0to create the most appropriate movement for the situation.Since his mind was focused on defeating the enemy that insulted Sylvia and Helen, he felt like his training was more efficient.\u201cThen.\u201dRaon brandished his sword once again and stomped the ground, training until the sun moved from the middle of the sky and went down into darkness.***Raon\u2019s schedule didn\u2019t change the next day.He went to the open area at daybreak and swung his sword over and over. One might ask why he was repeating the same thing over and over, but Raon knew that it was the correct thing to do.\u2018This repetition will save my life.\u2019What would save his life during a battle of life and death wasn\u2019t a new technique or expensive armor.The martial arts that became as natural as breathing through endless training was the only thing that would save him.Raon kept moving his feet and swinging his sword without rest.He mixed in the\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps\u00a0in between the\u00a0River Footwork\u00a0in order to increase the proficiency of the\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps.When it was time for lunch, Judiel went out to the open area, carrying a tray covered with white cloth.\u201cYoung master, I\u2019ve brought your lunch.\u201d\u201cLunch?\u201dRaon stopped practicing and turned around.\u201cYes, I brought simple sandwiches for you to eat.\u201dSince he was hungry, he sheathed his sword and sat at the table where Judiel put down the tray.\u201cSince you\u2019ve been exercising until a moment ago, please eat slowly to avoid upsetting your stomach.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJudiel bowed, then returned to the annex building.Raon wiped his hands with a wet towel, then rolled up the white cloth covering the tray.\u201cHmm?\u201dThere was a thin book next to the dish containing neatly prepared sandwiches.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019He frowned slightly and picked up the book. There was no name on the book, and the cover was so smooth that it looked like it had been created moments before.\u201cHuh!\u201dRaon gasped upon reading the contents. The names and particulars of\u00a0Raden Zieghart\u2019s swordsmanship and footwork\u00a0were written inside the book.Moreover, they were arranged in a way to make it easy to read.\u2018This book\u2026\u2019The book certainly contained extraordinary information, but it wasn\u2019t something that existed already.\u2018She made it.\u2019It must\u2019ve been a book that Judiel had made in a single day on Raden and the True Martial Palace.She really was outstanding considering she had also been doing her job as a maid while making the book. It would\u2019ve been a shame to keep using her as a spy despite her talent.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon smiled broadly, looking at Judiel\u2019s back and walking towards the annex building.\u201cShe isn\u2019t simply better than I thought. She is going to be really useful, far exceeding my expectations.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Sylvia was cleaning up the garden that she didn\u2019t finish the day before.She was skillfully transforming the messy grass into a round shape, like a fluffy cushion.\u201cFortunately, they aren\u2019t too badly ruined.\u201dHelen, who was helping her from behind, came up next to her.\u201cYou are right. It might become better than before after a little bit more work.\u201dSylvia used her scissors while smiling lightly. She cleaned up the messy places, as if she was trying to erase all traces of Raden\u2019s violence.\u201cMy lady.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cIs it okay to leave the young master like that?\u201dHelen\u2019s face was ashen gray. It looked like she had been too worried to sleep properly, and the same went for the other maids, as they kept blinking their eyes.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stop the Sword Duel at any cost\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought in the beginning.\u201dSylvia nodded while handing over the scissors.\u201cI thought I needed to stop it at all costs, and not let the Sword Duel happen no matter what. I was about to visit my father right away.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause Raon, that little boy, had the face of a real swordsman.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was something I told him before he left on his first mission. I told him to live proudly, like the Zieghart swordsmen in the past.\u201dShe turned around to meet Helen\u2019s eyes and smiled at the maids.\u201cRaon is way prouder and more awesome than what I told him. So much so that I\u2019m even ashamed of my current self.\u201d\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201d\u201cSince my child can make that kind of expression, I have to trust him as his mother. And\u2026\u201dSylvia smiled slightly, looking towards the back of the annex building, where Raon should have been training.\u201cJust as you felt, I had a feeling that everything was going to be okay when Raon said it would be alright. Our job now is to trust him and wait with a smile.\u201d***Raon burned the paper containing Raden\u2019s information that Judiel gave him after memorizing everything.Despite having never witnessed Raden\u2019s flexible swordsmanship, he felt like he could draw it in his head thanks to the detailed information he\u2019d been given.\u2018It should be enough to just keep training like this.\u2019Since his goal was to overwhelm Raden using the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0and the\u00a0River Footwork, which were common techniques, the information allowed him to prepare for the duel a lot more easily.He modified the footwork and the swordsmanship\u2019s flow slightly using Judiel\u2019s information and started training once again.His movements became a lot more systematic as he imagined the enemy\u2019s movement while swinging his sword and using his footwork.Whir!While he was fully focused on his training, a thin coldness came out from the ice flower bracelet.This is so sad.Wrath laughed at him while clicking his tongue.It\u2019s so pathetic that you need to make so much effort to fight garbage like him. The King of Essence would\u2019ve been able to freeze him to the bones with breath alone.\u201cI can easily win against him in my current state.\u201dRaon pushed away Wrath, who was breathing at him.\u201cBut the important part is to achieve an overwhelming victory, where his sword doesn\u2019t even get close to reaching my body.\u201dI don\u2019t understand. Isn\u2019t winning enough?\u201cNo.\u201dRaon shook his head. If it was a simple match, it didn\u2019t matter how he won. However, this case was different.\u201cMe and the annex building became the target of the direct line and their followers when I offended Raden. Even if the True Martial Palace can\u2019t threaten us anymore after my victory, there are probably going to be others targeting us instead.\u201dEvery house had a high and thick wall between the direct line and the collaterals. And the wall\u2019s thickness was impenetrable when it concerned a prestigious family like Zieghart.The direct line and their followers didn\u2019t want the collaterals to reach the same rank as them, even if they were people who used to be a part of the direct line.\u2018That\u2019s why I need to show them.\u2019It was necessary to carve the fact that he was more useful than the direct line into Glenn\u2019s memory.Ever since ancient times, humans have always been quibbling over lineage, and the density of the lineage on top of it, even though blood is red regardless of that. Who do they think they are, vampires? It\u2019s really an unsightly and nasty tradition.\u201cI agree with you for the first time.\u201dRaon showed a bitter smile at the fact that he was agreeing with a devil that got angry at anything and everything.Do your best, since everything you possess will become mine eventually.Wrath returned to the bracelet after saying that.\u201cWow, it\u2019s amazing how he can be so annoying with a single word.\u201dRaon stood up while laughing coldly. As he was about to resume his training, he felt the presence of somebody approaching.\u2018It\u2019s not Judiel.\u2019It wasn\u2019t Sylvia or Helen, but it was a very familiar presence. A small shape appeared as he stood still, waiting.\u201cHuh?\u201dBlank eyes, fluttering silver hair, snow white skin. Runaan was approaching the open area.\u201cRunaan?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dRunaan was walking with soft steps like a cat, hugging a package wrapped in a cloth. Upon arriving next to him, she sat down next to the tree.\u201cWhy are you\u2026\u201d\u201cFight.\u201dIt looked like Runaan was also aware of Raon\u2019s fight against Raden. It wasn\u2019t a simple fight though\u2014it was a Sword Duel.\u201cSo I came here.\u201dShe started unwrapping the cloth she brought, her small fingers fidgeting.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon felt numerous gazes on them while watching Runaan and raised his head. Behind the walls, the rocks, and the trees, Sylvia, Helen, and the maids were watching them.\u2018Seriously, these people.\u2019He thought they\u2019d become serious for once, but they had returned to being easy-going already. They really were strange.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dHe turned around upon hearing Runaan\u2019s voice. The package contained the ice cream box she carried around like a treasure.Tap.Runaan opened the box, revealing five bead ice creams. They were bigger and shinier than before, and white steam could be seen rising from them.\u201cEat.\u201dRaon stayed still, and Runaan started waving her hand in front of his eyes. Looking at her eyes, he thought he needed to eat\u00a0something\u00a0at least. However, he needed to choose something other than Runaan\u2019s favorite pink ice cream.What are you doing?! Eat it already!Wrath, who had returned to the bracelet earlier, popped back out like a mole.The King of Essence likes that green one! Eat the green ice cream with chocolate on it! Hurry up!Because Raon wasn\u2019t touching the ice cream, Wrath grew anxious and started spreading coldness everywhere.\u2018You are so noisy.\u2019Raon frowned. He didn\u2019t even look at the green ice cream Wrath wanted. As he was licking his lips, thinking about what to pick, Runaan\u2019s hand came towards his head.\u2018What?\u2019He wondered whether he should avoid her hand or not, but she didn\u2019t have any murderous intent nor animosity. Raon prepared to move any time it was necessary, by warming up the muscles in his entire body.Tap tap.Runaan\u2019s hand lightly tapped his head twice, rendering his anxiety pointless.\u201cRunaan?\u201dRaon\u2019s lips parted as he looked around. Runaan nodded while visibly raising the corners of her mouth and caressed his head once again.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dLooking at her gently shining silver eyes and hearing her calm voice, his heart tingled.That girl had visited the annex building in order to return the favor of telling her it was alright back when she fought against the orc.\u201cHah.\u201dRaon smirked. It was funny that such a small child was worried about him once again.However, it didn\u2019t feel that bad. He wasn\u2019t too sure, but it felt like some emotion was making his heart swell.\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dHe shook his head, taking the black bead ice cream from the box and put it in his mouth. His mouth was filled with a sugary, bitter taste, just like the emotion he was feeling.Oh! Chocolate! It looks like it\u2019s been fermented for a long time after adding sugar and coffee into the chocolate. Back in Devildom, the King of Essence liked coffee\u2026 Wh-what are you doing!\u2018Shut up.\u2019Raon forced Wrath back into the bracelet to avoid his long-winded speech.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201cIt is. Thank you.\u201d\u201cEat more.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s enough.\u201dIt really was enough. Rather than his belly being filled, it felt like his heart was full. He didn\u2019t need it anymore.\u201cI see.\u201dRunaan swallowed the red bead ice cream on the right side, then stood up.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dThen she left. It looked like she was telling him she wasn\u2019t going to disturb his training since she finished what she came to do.\u201cHaha.\u201dRaon smiled, looking at Runaan\u2019s light steps. Just looking at her back was enough to make him smile now.\u201cRaon.\u201dAs soon as Runaan left, Sylvia, who was hiding behind a tree, approached him.\u201cYou mom thinks you are closer than simple friends. That\u2019s not an average ice cream. It\u2019s a very expensive snack.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also curious. From the look of it, it\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve received ice cream from her.\u201d\u201cRaon, Mom wants to talk to her\u2026\u201d\u201cStop talking, both of you.\u201dRaon shook his hand. He didn\u2019t want them to be depressed, but he hated their playful gazes even more.\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *The next day, there was a second visitor to the annex building.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes, looking at the guest that looked grumpy as he walked.Honestly, he thought Runaan might visit him again since she liked following after him or learning his training methods.However, that guy was really unexpected.\u201cBurren.\u201dRaon tilted his head, looking at Burren as he walked elegantly towards him like a noble. He seriously couldn\u2019t figure out why he was visiting him.\u201cI heard you are going to have a Sword Duel against Raden.\u201dBurren pouted and stopped walking.\u201cDid you also hear about it?\u201d\u201cThe rumor is spreading throughout the entire house. They say that you arrogantly got into big trouble.\u201d\u201cBig trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cYou attacked a member of the direct line despite being a collateral and requested the Sword Duel despite not being a qualified swordsman. Of course the higher ups wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201dBurren looked down at the seated Raon and snorted. As Raon was about to ask him whether he came to make fun of him, Burren opened his mouth once again.\u201cHowever, I think you did a great job. I like it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRaon\u2019s jaw dropped after hearing something he never expected Burren to say.\u201cRaden is a piece of trash that keeps tarnishing Zieghart\u2019s name despite being a member of the direct line. He is strong, but he doesn\u2019t have any honor or conviction.\u201dHis voice was boiling with anger.\u201cAs soon as I heard there was an issue between you and Raden, I immediately guessed that the damn bastard picked a fight first. And my expectations were correct.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBurren\u2019s word signified that he actually trusted Raon, which was rather unexpected of him.\u201cTake this.\u201dBurren took out a box from his pocket at the size of a palm and handed it over.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s medicine to apply on your injury. It\u2019s too cheap for me to use, but I brought it here as I figured it would be suitable for you.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cTake it. Quickly!\u201dBurren forced him to take the medicine and turned around.\u201cYou are the fifth training ground\u2019s top trainee. Take that responsibility and don\u2019t lose, no matter what.\u201dAfter saying that, he returned the same way he came there. Interestingly, he was walking faster and faster. Judging from his red earlobes, he was being shy.\u201cHmm.\u201dRaon opened the lid of the box in his hand. The clear smell of the medicine came from it.He took a small amount of the medicine and spread it on his injured wrist, and the pain subsided along with a warm energy.\u2018Is he telling me this is cheap?\u2019The clear smell and the medicine\u2019s color told him that it was definitely not a cheap one. When he looked behind the lid, it said Saiman.Saiman was a guild famous for the efficiency of its medicines. It was a rare item, one that was difficult to obtain with money.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201dRaon shook his head and put the medicine in his pocket.\u201cRaon, when did you become close to Burren\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master, another friend\u2026\u201dSince Burren was gone, Sylvia and Helen, who were spectating them, approached him with a smile.\u201cStop coming here!\u201d***Unlike the busy annex building where Raon was training every day, the True Martial Palace remained silent.It looked like they didn\u2019t even care about the Sword Duel against Raon, since they were certain about their victory.Going along with that atmosphere, Raden wasn\u2019t doing any training and stayed even relaxed more than usual.\u201cYoung master.\u201dThe butler Merkin bowed to Raden.\u201cWhat?\u201dRaden, who was lying in bed with a red-haired maid, turned his head.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you start training a little now? There\u2019s not much time left until the Sword Duel.\u201d\u201cTraining? Did you just say that to me?\u201dRaden chuckled and raised his body.\u201cWhy would I need to train to fight a weakling like that? If I had used the flexible sword back then, he would\u2019ve been six feet under by now\u2014in pieces.\u201d\u201cB-but his movements were rather extraordinary. I managed to predict his sword and blocked it, but I didn\u2019t even manage to see his fist properly.\u201dMerkin rubbed the place Raon had hit him.\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m the same as you! Grr!\u201dRaden threw the wine glass from the table. As the glass containing red wine broke, red liquid spread across the floor like blood.\u201cI know the techniques he uses! It\u2019s the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0and the\u00a0River Footwork\u00a0that I\u2019ve also learned. I can shred him apart with my eyes closed if I use the flexible sword!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should be the one training. You fucking fainted at the most important moment!\u201d\u201cPlease, excuse me.\u201d\u201cGet out of my sight!\u201dRaden shouted, then laid down on the bed once again. Merkin bowed then left Raden\u2019s room.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Merkin shook his head, looking at Raden\u2019s room where a giggling sound could be heard.It looked like he had no intention of training because of the humiliation he felt from losing to Raon.He must\u2019ve been trying to protect his ego by showing that he could defeat him without training.\u2018Raon Zieghart.\u2019However, he had obtained information that Raon was training every day, to the best of his abilities, from the annex building.\u2018That guy is really outstanding.\u2019Raon\u2019s movements were enigmatic. It was difficult to read his presence or movement, much like an assassin.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dMerkin sighed. He felt like he could already see the result of the Sword Duel.***Martha was sitting on a tree at the entrance of North Grave Mountain where she could see the open area in the annex building.\u201cTsk.\u201dShe clicked her tongue, wrapping the black hair that was touching her cheek around her finger.\u201cHe is annoyingly popular. Why are there so many people visiting him?\u201dMartha was looking at Raon, who was sitting in the open area and talking with the fifth training ground trainees. While she had been watching him, she had already seen seven trainees visiting Raon.She couldn\u2019t hear them exactly, but they looked like they were cheering for his victory.\u201cHmph, since when did they become friends?\u201dLooking at the trainees that were pretending to be his friends after the last mission, despite the fact that they had never cared about him in the training ground, Martha felt irritated.\u201cThey are all so pathetic\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try visiting him, too?\u201d\u201cKya!\u201dHearing a voice from behind, Martha screamed and fell from the tree.\u201cWow, it feels great to tease you.\u201dWhen she raised her head, Rimmer was giggling while swinging his feet in the air.\u201cRaon\u2019s no fun since he doesn\u2019t get surprised with something like this.\u201d\u201cYou damned elf\u2026\u201dMartha ground her teeth and raised her body. As her black eyes were about to be dyed into red, Rimmer shook his hand.\u201cIs that really okay? He already noticed.\u201dShe turned around following Rimmer\u2019s chin gesture, and Raon was looking at them from the open area.\u201cUgh, you must\u2019ve done this on purpose\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you come to visit him, you should go see him and cheer him up.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to cheer him up!\u201d\u201cHuh? Then what are those things in your pocket? Are they for me?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s because he saved me during the mission\u2026\u201dMartha put her hand in her coat pocket and wrinkled her nose.\u201cCheer him up. It\u2019s going to help him.\u201dRimmer smiled and pointed at the open area. Raon was still looking at them.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dMartha bit her lip and went down the mountain.\u201cHnng!\u201dRimmer started humming, lying on the branch Martha fell from.\u201cShe\u2019s so naive. I guess that\u2019s the privilege of children.\u201d***Raon narrowed his eyes as he watched Martha walk down from the North Grave Mountain. He had already realized she was up there, but he wasn\u2019t expecting her to come down. It seemed Rimmer had played a prank on her.\u201cHey.\u201dMartha threw a small glass bottle and a square box wrapped in cloth at him.\u201cHuh?\u201dRaon caught the box and the bottle flying towards his chest.\u201cI\u2019m returning the favor for that time. Consume them before the Sword Duel starts.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not poison. That\u2019s mind-clearing water that recovers your willpower, so you can drink it or throw it away if you want.\u201dAs he stared at the glass bottle, Martha took a step closer to him and frowned.\u201cThank you.\u201dRaon put the glass bottle in his pocket.\u201cI was going to trample on that son of a monkey because he kept being annoying, but you beat me to it. Make sure to leave him half dead since you\u2019re fighting him, that way he won\u2019t be able to act rude against your mom ever again.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m canceling my promise with you if you lose to that son of a monkey.\u201dRaon just nodded and Martha turned around, fluttering her black hair, which reached under her shoulders now.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dShe left the open area without even looking back.\u201cWhy did she not say anything about this one?\u201dRaon tilted his head and opened the box Martha gave him.\u201cBeef?\u201dBeef was inside the box, and its quality seemed to be much higher than the usual meat he had in the annex building.\u2018It was her doing.\u2019Sylvia had mentioned a high-quality beef was left in front of the annex building occasionally, and it ended up being Martha\u2019s gift.Are you telling me that black-eyes was the one that provided that tasty beef?\u2018Yes.\u2019Hmm, Fine. The King of Essence is a generous monarch. I\u2019m going to call the black-eyes the beef girl from now on.\u2018\u2026\u2026\u2019Ignoring Wrath\u2019s useless chatter, Raon took the beef. It was at that moment that Sylvia and Helen burst out from the bush like moles coming out of their holes.\u201cBeef and mind-clearing water? She is full of consideration for you, Raon.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Beef is great but presenting something as expensive as mind-clearing water means you aren\u2019t just friends.\u201d\u201cRaon, invite Martha to a meal next time\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, please go away!\u201dRaon shook his head. They quickly retreated into the bush, then went back to the annex building.\u2018Seriously\u2026\u2019It was only a few days ago that he was worried about them because of how depressed they were, but their lightheartedness was now getting out of control.\u2018Well, I guess this is better.\u2019Sylvia and Helen were showing that cheerful attitude because they trusted him and didn\u2019t want to make him worry.They were cheerful people to begin with. Raon needed to keep the harmful people from even touching their shadows in order to protect their smiles.Raon slowly caught his breath, then stood up to resume his training.The training continued day and night, and the day of the Sword Duel finally came.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93The direct line and people who got the permission from division leaders or the head of house were the only people allowed to train in the Zieghart great training ground.However, there were a few exceptions. The Sword Duel was one of them.In case a Sword Duel happened where two swordsmen fought, putting their pride at stake, everyone that wanted to spectate was allowed to enter the great training ground.There was more than an hour left until the start of the Sword Duel, but the great training ground\u2019s seats were already full because of how famous the two participants were.Those that didn\u2019t manage to take a seat were busily moving around in order to find a decent spot on the outskirts.The great training ground looked like the marketplace with so many people babbling around, but they were all pretty much talking about the same thing.\u201cThis is a really peculiar Sword Duel, one that probably doesn\u2019t even happen once every hundred years. Anyone who misses this duel will regret it for their entire life.\u201d\u201cIndeed, a fight like this will never happen again.\u201d\u201cI guess, since it\u2019s between a swordsman from the direct line and a collateral trainee.\u201d\u201cAnd they are the most rumored children nowadays.\u201dA duel between a swordsman from the direct line and a collateral trainee. And since it was a Sword Duel between two people that had recently performed great achievements for the house, people were extremely interested in the event.\u201cI wonder who is going to win between Raon and young master Raden. It\u2019s not going to be fun if they are on a different level.\u201d\u201cHmm, even though it\u2019s a peculiar Sword Duel, the result has already been decided.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Raon to win, even if he is strong for his age.\u201d\u201cBut I heard he killed the Green War Demon\u2026\u201d\u201cRaon didn\u2019t do that alone. He fought alongside the fifth training ground\u2019s trainees.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, young master Raden destroyed a White Blood Religion\u2019s branch on his own. Even if it was a small branch, that\u2019s not something easy to do.\u201dSince most of the swordsmen believed Raon\u2019s rumor was exaggerated, they were sure that Raden was going to win.\u201cNo way, Raon held his ground against the Blood Raving Demon, who is at Master\u2019s level. You won\u2019t know until they fight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just Rimmer spewing bullshit. It\u2019s a lie.\u201d\u201cNo, I think he held his ground. For a few seconds.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like the young master Raden, and think it was his mistake this time, but it can\u2019t be helped. He is already an intermediate level Expert, which is way stronger than Raon.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cI guess\u2026\u201dIt looked like the public opinion had been decided, and the number of people expecting Raon to win kept decreasing.The swordsmen in the great training ground could already imagine Raon\u2019s loss in their heads.\u201cI think it would be great of him if Raon manages to make a stand for some time. If the head of house is satisfied with the fight, he might change the content of the bet\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are babbling so much dogshit through that trap.\u201d\u201cWho\u2026 ugh!\u201dThe swordsmen turned their heads upon hearing a chilly voice from behind them. Martha Zieghart was standing there, wrinkling her lovely forehead.\u201cBullshit? Lies?\u201dMartha leaned forward and snorted.\u201cIf that was really a lie, do you think me or Burren would\u2019ve done nothing about it? Is your head just a decoration? How about thinking from time to time, huh?\u201dVulgar words came from her mouth despite her beautiful appearance.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe swordsmen turned while groaning instead of talking back to Martha. They had no choice, since they didn\u2019t dare offend Denier Zieghart\u2019s beloved daughter even though they were official swordsmen.\u201cWatch closely with those dead fisheyes of yours.\u201dMartha crossed her arms and leaned back in her chair.\u201cSince something completely different from your expectations is about to happen.\u201d***\u201cDenier raised his daughter incorrectly.\u201dBalder, who was sitting on the platform, crossed his legs and smiled coldly.\u201cNo, I guess he didn\u2019t raise her incorrectly, but picked the wrong child.\u201dHe murmured that there was no way she could be talented as she had peepholes for eyes.However, he didn\u2019t really care about how Martha rudely treated the swordsmen. That was the extent of the difference existing in the world between the direct lines and collaterals or people below them.\u201cThe fight is already decided. I want the Sword Duel to be over already and hear that arrogant bastard\u2019s scream.\u201dThe result of the duel was as plain as day. No matter how talented Raon was, it was impossible for him to win against Raden, as he had never experienced fighting a flexible sword.He smiled in anticipation, eager to watch Raon scream upon getting his energy center destroyed and his mana circuit ripped apart after the Sword Duel.\u201cOh! It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dHearing a cheerful voice that didn\u2019t match the platform\u2019s solemn atmosphere, Balder\u2019s head turned.\u201cRimmer?\u201dThe red-haired elf was walking up to him while grinning like a fool.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cAh, I came to see you since I noticed you while passing by.\u201d\u201cThen just keep passing by.\u201d\u201cAhaha! Nice joke.\u201dEven though he told him to go away, Rimmer didn\u2019t get down from the platform, sticking next to Balder instead.\u201cDo you think we are close enough to joke around?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you said something funny.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou said the fight is already decided, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cYour broken eyes should still be able to see it, the difference in pressure between Raden and the loser you\u2019ve trained.\u201d\u201cHmm, there\u2019s certainly a clear difference.\u201dRimmer whistled, looking at Raon and Raden, who were standing on opposite sides of the great training ground.\u201cBut the fight isn\u2019t necessarily decided by pressure and might.\u201d\u201cHmph, that\u2019s only true concerning the bugs. Once they are at the Expert level, it\u2019s difficult to overcome the difference in level. Moreover, Raden is a flexible swordsman. Your student will be ripped apart with his flesh and bone torn off.\u201d\u201cThen shall we make a bet?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you are that confident, let\u2019s make a bet.\u201dRimmer smiled broadly and extended his hand.\u201cIs this another trick of yours, just like when you spread that false rumor about him fighting against the Blood Raving Demon?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way a trick would work when the head of house is going to witness the fight today.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dBalder\u2019s pupils expanded. This was the reason that Rimmer was difficult to deal with. He was still meeting the head of house, his father, once in a while.\u201cSince you look so confident, let\u2019s bet something. If you are scared, you can just withdraw\u2026\u201d\u201cShut your mouth!\u201dBalder frowned, and the foothold under his feet was crushed.\u201cAhaha! It was a joke.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to bet?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m betting this.\u201dA leaf-shaped dagger came out from Rimmer\u2019s shirt. It was reflecting a mysterious light, and the clear scent of real leaves under the sunlight.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you recognize this.\u201d\u201cAre you seriously putting this at stake for the bet?\u201d\u201cOf course. The bet is all about all in! All in!\u201d\u201c\u2026Then what do you want? Do you want my Dragon\u2019s Diamond Warblade or something?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need something like that.\u201dRimmer shook his head and grinned. It was the same expression as when he was playing a prank on Burren or Raon.\u201cI\u2026\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Raon rolled his wrists and ankles to warm himself up. Even though it was his first time visiting the great training ground, and countless people were watching him, he didn\u2019t feel nervous at all.\u2018The medicine was really effective.\u2019Probably because he drank the mind-clearing water before coming there, his head was clear and his heart was beating slowly and calmly.Burren\u2019s medicine was also effective, and his injuries were now completely healed. It seemed he could bring out the best of his abilities, just like when he trained in the open area or in the fifth training ground.Raon looked at Raden, who was standing on the opposite side from him. He was sipping on wine right before the fight.\u2018He must be trying to show his confidence.\u2019The reason that he was showing such a carefree attitude was simple. He was trying to show the difference between himself and Raon.\u2018However\u2026\u2019That was something he shouldn't be doing unless there was an overwhelming difference or he was certain about his victory.Raon smiled coldly, looking at Raden as he enjoyed a massage from a maid. He was going to regret what happened that day for the rest of his life.\u201cZieghart\u2019s heaven is entering! Everyone, show your respect!\u201dAs he was warming up his shoulders, the swordsmen standing in front of the training ground\u2019s main entrance started shouting.Rumble!The enormous door split open, and Glenn entered along with the Heavenly Blade Division.Despite having lots of people around him, only Glenn entered Raon\u2019s sight. His breathtaking pressure was making the training ground\u2019s atmosphere as sharp as needles piercing the skin.The stronger he got, the more he realized how high Glenn's level was, giving him goosebumps.\u201cGreeting my lord!\u201dRaon knelt and bowed, just like everyone in the training ground.Do you really have to kneel down and bow every single time you see him? It must be really annoying to be human.Wrath clicked his tongue in irritation. However, his voice contained a slight note of envy.Since he went down from being the monarch of devildom to a shabby freeloader living in the bracelet, he seemed to be jealous of Glenn, who received respect and fear from everyone.\u2018You are so narrow-minded.\u2019What did you say?\u2018Nothing.\u2019Raon lowered his head and smiled slightly.\u201cEveryone, rise.\u201dIn the meantime, Glenn sat on the throne in the middle of the platform and opened his mouth. Even though it was a quiet voice, everyone could hear it clearly.\u201cThank you!\u201dZieghart\u2019s swordsmen bowed once again, then stood up.\u201cGood.\u201dGlenn slowly lowered his gaze to look at Raon on the west and Raden on the east, one after the other, then nodded.\u201cBegin the Sword Duel.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe ringmaster, who was standing under the platform, bowed to Glenn before he turned around.Whoosh!As soon as he raised his hand, the flag bearers standing on the great training ground\u2019s outskirts waved the flags with the flame sword\u2019s emblem at the same time, which created an illusion of the entire training ground rippling in flames.\u201cCompetitors, come forth!\u201d\u201cFinally.\u201dRaden extended his hand with a grin, and the maid standing behind him brought him his sword. He took out a wobbling sword from the sheath longer than a spear.Cring.The long and thin flexible sword flailed like a snake, creating a strange sound.Raon looked back, ignoring Raden\u2019s murderous gaze.He could see Sylvia biting her lip while holding onto the handrail tightly. He conveyed his message with his gaze: it was alright, so just rest assured and wait.Helen and the maids were clasping their hands together next to Sylvia, shoulders trembling as if they were praying to God.Raon braced himself. It wasn\u2019t a fight against Raden, but a war in order to protect them.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled to empty his mind and stepped up to face Raden.***\u201cHaa!\u201dRaden tilted his head back to look at the sky. How long had he been waiting for this day? One week felt longer than an entire year.\u2018I can finally pay him back.\u2019The humiliation he felt in the annex building. The time had finally come for him to change the spiteful gazes of the swordsmen as they held their laughter in each time they looked at him.Holding back the excitement filling his entire body, he brandished his flexible sword.\u2018Come at me. I\u2019ll\u2026 that bastard.\u2019Raden grinded his teeth. Raon was looking at Sylvia and the maids behind him instead of himself.Raon\u2019s disinterest towards him right before the fight exasperated him.\u2018I\u2019m going to cut your limbs off.\u2019Raden became exhilarated upon imagining Raon and the maids\u2019 expressions after he cut off his limbs during the Sword Duel, getting his energy center and mana circuit destroyed as a result.\u201cBe ready.\u201dRaden flexed his wrist, hearing the ringmaster\u2019s signal. Although he was only moving his wrist slightly, the flexible sword wriggled like a snake.\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201dRaon nodded without even drawing his sword.\u201cHaa, it\u2019s my first time seeing such an arrogant bastard.\u201dRaden raised his chin and wrinkled his nose.\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how lucky you were that day.\u201d\u201cLucky?\u201dRaon snickered, touching the sheath of his sword.\u201cSeriously, you bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease step back.\u201dThe ringleader forcefully pushed Raden back.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can still smile like that after your arms get cut off and your energy center gets ripped apart.\u201d\u201cI guess you won\u2019t be able to see it.\u201dRaon grabbed the sheath while maintaining his smile.Crack.Raden stepped back while grinding his teeth to a point that they could break. It was better to start the Sword Duel faster instead of arguing with him.The ringleader checked their readiness with his gaze and they both nodded their heads.\u201cThen, the Sword Duel between Raden Zieghart and Raon Zieghart has begun!\u201dThe ringleader raised his hand, blocking the sight between Raden and Raon, then stepped back.\u201cKuhahaha!\u201dRaden laughed like a madman and swung his flexible sword. With a fluttering sound, the sword curled like a ribbon and dove at Raon.Raon twisted his body like a drifting flower petal to dodge the flexible sword.\u201cDo you really think you managed to dodge it?\u201dRaden raised his wrist and the flexible sword fluctuated like a tidal wave, following Raon.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dRaon tried dodging the flexible sword using the \u2018River Footwork\u2019, but Raden was already aware of that flow.\u201cI told you already. It\u2019s different from back then! Try running away!\u201dRaden grinned and used the third form of\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword,\u00a0Demonic Crystal. The flexible sword\u2019s blade bent in a zigzag, aimed at Raon\u2019s leg.Clank!Raon drew his sword and lowered it. He seemed to be trying to block the\u00a0Demonic Crystal\u00a0because he wasn\u2019t able to dodge it.\u201cKeuh!\u201dRaden licked his lips.\u2018What an idiot!\u2019Flexible swordsmanship was extremely difficult to defend against because its direction changed too quickly. If he tried defending what he saw, he would get cut somewhere else.The same went for Raon. He lowered his sword in order to defend the attack against his legs, but that was a huge mistake.Swish!Raden turned his wrist, the flexible sword aimed at Raon\u2019s thigh bursting up like a snake crawling up a vine.\u2018I\u2019m going to take your arm, just like I warned you I would!\u2019He could already see Raon screaming as his sharp blade slashed through Raon\u2019s arm.\u201cHuh?\u201dRaden swallowed. Right before the flexible sword ripped apart his arm, Raon disappeared from his sight.\u201cWh-whe\u2026gasp!\u201dRaden\u2019s hand, the one holding his sword, trembled as he screamed. Something cold could be felt against his neck. When he turned his eyes, Raon\u2014who had disappeared\u2014was touching his neck with his sword.\u201cWh-what happened\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the first time.\u201d\u201cF-first time? First time for what?\u201d\u201cYou are going to die eight times today.\u201dAfter saying that, Raon\u2019s fist struck Raden\u2019s face.Smack!____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94\u201cKuah!\u201dRaden grabbed his head and stepped back. He looked like an insane person, his untied hair flapping into the wind.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe extreme pain made him groan.He still couldn\u2019t understand what had happened. How was his sword already at his neck, why did his face hurt? He couldn\u2019t understand anything.\u201cWh-what did you do to me?\u201dRaden grit his teeth and raised his head, looking towards Raon\u2014who was standing still, just looking at him.\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I dodged your sword and punched you in the face.\u201dHe answered, as casual as if discussing a meal.\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is how you did that\u2026\u201d\u201cThis makes it once.\u201dRaon raised his index finger while saying something completely unrelated to the question.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI told you, you will die eight times today. That just now was the price for your lie about sending a letter that we never received.\u201d\u201cY-you bastard\u2026\u201dRaden\u2019s eyes grew so wide that they looked like they would tear. He wanted to rip Raon\u2019s limbs apart right now.\u201cEight times? Stop spouting bullshit! You are going to regret not having finished the Sword Duel just now for the rest of your life!\u201dRaden barked, swinging his flexible sword.Crash!The flexible aura-imbued sword started to devastate their surroundings. It was the\u00a0Radiant Vortex\u00a0of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword.Rumble!The flexible sword thrashed like a Kraken\u2019s tentacles, yet Raon dodged every single aura blade by using \u2018River Footwork\u2019.\u2018How dare you!\u2019Raden clenched his fist and turned his flexible sword. The aura blade in his flexible sword trembled like a tidal wave, blocking Raon\u2019s path.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t try to get him in a single strike.\u2019Since he still didn\u2019t understand what happened back then, he needed to be careful. It was necessary to pressure him, like catching a bug in the room by cornering it.He wasn\u2019t just using his wrist, but also his elbow and shoulder to fully utilize the flexible sword\u2019s long blade.It must look like a wall of sword and aura blade in Raon\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll make you into a filet.\u201dRaden used the tenth form of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword,\u00a0Red Wall of Destruction. The flexible sword stormed at Raon, twisted like rose bushes.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIn the midst of deflecting the flexible sword by using\u00a0River Footwork,\u00a0Raon turned around. He withdrew in order to avoid the\u00a0Red Wall of Destruction.\u201cI got you!\u201dThe\u00a0Red Wall of Destruction\u00a0grew faster if the opponent tries to run away. He was now just a rat in a trap.Stomp!After moving all the way to the back, Raon turned midair and kicked the ground.\u2018What is this guy?!\u2019The way he was running at the wall of aura blade could be only described as crazy.Raden gasped. The moment the\u00a0Red Wall of Destruction\u00a0was pushed back to the extreme, his body disappeared like a candlelight.\u201cDamn it!\u201dHe hurriedly looked around. Expecting him to appear from his right side like the last time, he pulled his flexible sword.\u2018Is he not here?\u2019However, nothing could be seen from his right side.\u201cI\u2019m on your left.\u201dEven before the word reached his ears, an excruciating pain could be felt from the left side of his face.\u201cKuaah!\u201dRaden screamed from the impact to his left cheekbone, rolling on the ground.\u201cUggh\u2026\u201dThe pain wasn\u2019t subsiding. His cheekbone must\u2019ve been crushed.\u201cUaaaah!\u201dRaden roared. He imbued his sword with aura to stick the blade on the ground, using it as a support to stand up.\u201c\u2026Wh-what did you do just now? You were definitely in front of me!\u201d\u201cThis is the price for spitting on my mother\u2019s hand-grown flower.\u201d\u201cYou crazy bastard!\u201dLooking at Raon's unwavering eyes, his chin trembled. It looked like that crazy bastard was seriously going to return the eight debts.\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet!\u201dRaden stepped back and gathered his aura from his energy center. He wasn\u2019t playing around anymore. Screw the Sword Duel, he decided he would kill him right there and then.Rumble!He brandished his flexible sword while spreading his aura to the mana circuits in his entire body. His clothes fluttered with his rambling aura, despite the windless atmosphere.\u201cI\u2019m going to pluck your bones out before killing you!\u201dRaden thrust his straightened flexible sword. At lightning speed, it reached right in front of Raon\u2019s eyes in a blink of an eye.Whir.The moment Raon was about to swing his sword to defend himself, Raden\u2019s entire right arm started vibrating.Baaaam!The intense vibration passed up the flexible sword, and its straight trajectory became twisted, like a coiled snake.It was the formidable technique of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword,\u00a0Flexible Sword of Explosion, which ripped apart the enemy like a Kraken crushing the ocean with its eight tentacles.However, Raon didn\u2019t step back despite facing the sharp blade severing the air. His eyes shone as he lowered his posture.\u2018Is that bastard doing it again?\u2019Raden grit his teeth. He had disappeared and reappeared from his right and left side the last time his eyes shone like that.\u201cKuaaah!\u201dHe thrust the\u00a0Flexible Sword of Explosion, along with all the aura he had gathered, to the best of his abilities. The gathering of aura blades puffed up like a balloon, storming at\u00a0Raon.\u2018I need to focus.\u2019He couldn\u2019t let the same technique reach him three times in a row like an idiot. He sharpened his senses to their limits in preparation for Raon, who could pierce through the wall of his flexible sword at any moment.Crash!The powerful aura blade of the\u00a0Flexible Sword of Explosion\u00a0cut through the ground like paper. However, he couldn\u2019t sense it cutting any flesh. He had disappeared once again.\u201cWhere are you?\u201dRaden spread his aura perception and retrieved his flexible sword to block his surroundings. Left, right, or behind. He prepared himself so that he could block him no matter which direction he came from.\u201cI\u2019m in front of you.\u201dHowever, Raon\u2019s voice could be heard from the front, not from left, right, or behind. He hurriedly tried to defend, but Raon moved faster.Smack!Raon\u2019s fist thrust like a ray of light, crushing Raden\u2019s chin.\u201cKuaah!\u201dRaden grabbed his chin and screamed. It hurt. It hurt more than when he was hit on his cheeks, more than when his cheekbone was crushed.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe blood flowed to the ground. It looked like his jawbone was shattered and his skin was torn.\u201cThe third strike is for trampling on my mother\u2019s hand-grown flowers.\u201dRaon shook out his sword while walking towards Raden.\u201cI\u2019ve understood everything about your sword. I won\u2019t even need to dodge anymore.\u201d\u201cBullshit\u2026\u201dRaden quickly stood up and started steaming from his mouth. His head was filled with the desire to kill him, but he bit his cheek to calm himself down.\u2018It\u2019s a provocation. A provocation.\u2019His fingers were trembling. He could end up fainting if he got beaten up any further. He was going to lose everything if he lost, which wasn\u2019t an option.\u201cHaaaa!\u201dHe vibrated his entire energy center to spread aura throughout his body. He wouldn\u2019t last for a long time, but he could become stronger than ever for a moment.Baaam!Despite the exploding energy, he controlled his mind and calmly used the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword. A faster, sharper, flashier aura blade stormed into the air.\u2018He can\u2019t dodge this.\u2019The aura blade directed at Raon was the most accurate one so far.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Raon used\u00a0River Footwork\u00a0to enter into the wave of the aura blade.The\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0he was using now was on a different level from what\u00a0Raon had experienced so far. He was going to pay for his arrogance.\u2018Die.\u2019The moment he was about to pierce through Raon\u2019s heart with the extremity of the curved sword, Raon\u2019s sword came up diagonally.Clang!His arm faltered from the powerful impact transferred through the flexible sword.\u201cWh-what?\u201dHe was definitely aiming for his heart after deflecting Raon\u2019s sword, yet his technique was interrupted midway.\u201cEek!\u201dRaden used the fourth form of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0to pressure\u00a0Raon.However\u2026Clang!Raon swung his sword, and the flexible sword bounced back and became limp.\u201cHaa!\u201dWith a war cry, he launched another\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword. However, his technique was cut to pieces each time\u00a0Raon swung his sword, and he couldn\u2019t connect his strikes.\u201cN-no way\u2026\u201dHis mind was breaking, despite having calmed it down with difficulty. He was nullifying his swordsmanship, as if he had really understood everything about his\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword.\u201cI told you already, I know everything about your technique.\u201dRaon stormed at him after parrying his sword.\u201cG-get away from me!\u201dRaden thrust his left fist, but Raon easily dodged it then struck him with his sword.Smack!His forehead was struck with the flat of his sword, sending him flying back like a kicked ball.\u201cKuaaah!\u201dRaden covered his forehead and writhed on the ground in extreme pain.\u201cTh-this can\u2019t be true!\u201dHe felt like fainting from the intense pain, but he bit his lip and stood back up. It wasn\u2019t the time for him to be lying around.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201dIt was impossible to understand the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0in that short of a time. No, it had to be impossible.\u201cThe fourth is the cost for hitting Helen.\u201dRaon slowly walked towards Raden, ignoring his words.\u2018This can\u2019t be happening!\u2019Raden tightly grabbed on his sheath, taking up the flexible sword.\u201cHaaaa!\u201dHe used the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0faster and sharper than ever.Sheesh!A powerful will was ingrained in the flexible sword, creating a flashy trajectory to storm at Raon. Speed, sharpness, power. Everything was on a different level from before.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, Raon\u2019s steps remained the same as before. He casually walked into the storm of the flexible sword, as if he were on a stroll.Clang!Raon swung his sword. It looked like he was just chasing away an insignificant fly, yet the flexible sword faltered significantly.That was enough to make all the changes and flow he had created so far.\u201cEek!\u201dRaden didn\u2019t give up. He used another formidable technique by turning the wobbling flexible sword.Baaam!The aura blade in his sword rained down at him.Raon\u2019s\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0connected his movement into a swing towards the rain of aura blade.Clang!It was a simple swing that had nothing special to it, yet the formidable technique of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0was cut off and the flexible sword bounced back violently.\u201cWh-what! What\u2019s happening?\u201dRaden stepped backwards with a trembling chin. He couldn\u2019t believe that he had cut off the formidable technique with a single swing even though he had just experienced it himself.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with this. There\u2019s no way!\u201dHe grabbed his left hand with his trembling right hand and swung the flexible sword. He used the second formidable technique of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword,\u00a0Exploding Fang.Kieee!A sharp and fierce strike like a beast\u2019s fang was aimed at Raon\u2019s heart and neck.Raon halted his movements. There was no sign of panic. He just lowered his sword.Whir!There was no hesitation in his movements, similar to a great painter drawing a picture. And the\u00a0Exploding Fang\u00a0was dissolved, just like that.The aura blade dissipated and his technique was crushed, all from a single swing of his sword.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaden sighed. His heart tightened, looking at Raon walking up to him after erasing the\u00a0Exploding Fang.Star Connecting Sword\u00a0and\u00a0River Footwork.Those were techniques that any swordsman in the continent would know, yet he was unable to pierce through them.Despite being well acquainted with the moves he was using, he couldn\u2019t find any way to defend against them.\u201cHuff, huff!\u201dHe was out of breath. Each time Raon moved his sword, he felt like his head was entering a savage beast\u2019s mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t come closer! I\u2019m telling you to stay away!\u201dHe tried swinging his flexible sword again, but it was just bounced away by Raon\u2019s sword, ending up stuck in the ground.Smack!Upon reaching him after erasing all his aura blades, Raon took up his sword and slapped his cheek.\u201cKuh!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even speak because of the pain growing even worse, to the point that his limbs were convulsing.\u201cKeauh!\u201dInstead of a scream, Raden let out a strange groan and grabbed his busted cheek.\u201cStand up.\u201dThe flame of anger burning in Raon\u2019s eyes wasn\u2019t extinguished yet.\u201cIt\u2019s still only the fifth one.\u201d***The Sword Duel went just like Raon had intended, from the beginning to the end.Raden yielded to his provocation and used the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0that he hadn\u2019t perfectly acquired yet, and\u00a0Raon used the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0that he was so used to that he could use it with his eyes closed.Who is going to win if a swordsman that wasn\u2019t completely used to excellent swordsmanship fights was pitted against a swordsman who completed an average technique to perfection?Most people would believe it would be the former.That was not the case.An advanced yet incomplete technique created powerful and flashy strikes, but it couldn\u2019t adjust to every situation.On the other hand, a swordsman that perfected a basic swordsmanship could adjust to each situation in the most suitable way.At first, the swordsman with a powerful swordsmanship might look like he had the upper hand, but the difference would grow over time and the one with basic technique would end up with the advantage.Moreover, the most important part wasn\u2019t the technique, but the one using it.Since the person using the basic swordsmanship was Raon, who had learned the\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0and had\u00a0Judiel\u2019s information, the one-sided beating on Raden was a natural course of action.Raon looked at Raden, who was trying to stand up as he bled.\u201cN-not yet. It\u2019s not over yet. I-I will never lose\u2026\u201dThe severe murderous intent from his eyes was his malice, his desire to kill him at any cost.\u201cKuaaah!\u201dRaden\u2019s aura burst up. His surroundings were dyed green and the ground trembled.\u201cHaa.\u201dFeeling the frightening murderous intent and aura blade trying to rip his skin apart, Raon grew calmer and brandished his sword.Middle posture. It was one of the basic postures, consisting of holding the sword in front of the abdomen. Despite facing intense pressure, Raon\u2019s sword didn\u2019t waver in the slightest.\u201cDie!\u201dRaden swung his sword with explosive energy. The single blade was split into dozens of blades in the spur of the moment, thrusting at Raon\u2019s vital points all around his body.It was the final technique of the\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword,\u00a0Great Rainstorm, that Raden had been saving for last.Facing the bundle of aura blades, where a single one could cost his life, Raon brandished his sword.Compared to the flexible sword moving like a light, Raon\u2019s movement was so slow that it could be called boring. However, neither his sword nor his eyes were faltering.Whoosh!The moment the aura blade reached right under Raon\u2019s nose after tearing apart everything, Raon swung his sword.It wasn\u2019t slow, or fast, or flashy.Yet, the true meaning of swordsmanship was incorporated in it.Star Connecting Sword. Just as its name suggested, the techniques connected with each other naturally, without a single mistake.The\u00a0Great Rainstorm\u00a0that was about to swallow\u00a0Raon was split apart by the great flow of the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaden\u2019s bloodshot eyes could be seen in the midst of the aura blade tearing apart. It was an expression of bewilderment, rather than panic.\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will be annoying if you give up now.\u201dRaon shook out his sword and approached Raden.\u201cBecause you need to die three more times.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95\u201cMy lady, I can\u2019t watch this anymore.\u201dHelen couldn\u2019t open her eyes even before the Sword Duel started. She had always viewed Raon as her own son, ever since he was born. And the fact that he was going to have a Sword Duel against Raden, who was infamous for his cruelty, was making her so nervous that she could hardly breathe.\u201cBut we have to watch him.\u201dUnlike Helen, Sylvia was staring at Raon with her eyes wide open.\u201cBecause he is fighting for our sake.\u201dHelen tried opening her eyes. Raon was standing in the middle of the training ground, warming himself up. The fact that he didn\u2019t look any different from usual eased her tension slightly.\u201cHaa, but I\u2019m still nervous. How is my lady\u2026?\u201dHer eyes widened after she turned her head to look at Sylvia. It was because her hand was trembling so much that even the handrail was trembling with her.\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201dHelen barely managed to stop herself from crying. Sylvia was desperately trying not to show her emotions on the outside, despite being even more nervous and anxious than herself.Because she knew about Sylvia\u2019s difficult childhood, she felt both proud of her and sorry for her.\u2018\u2026Can she ever be happy?\u2019She felt bad for both Sylvia and Raon. She would\u2019ve already made them leave that place if only she had the ability to do so.\u201cHe will be alright.\u201dJudiel turned to look at them with a calm gaze.\u201cThe young master has been preparing against Raden\u2019s flexible sword day and night. I\u2019m sure everyone here will be astonished by his performance.\u201d\u201cTh-that would be great, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are right. Let\u2019s think like that, Helen. Thank you.\u201dSylvia thanked Judiel with her eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s hold hands. Come on.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hold hands and pray for Raon\u2019s victory.\u201dSylvia went ahead and grabbed Helen\u2019s hand. With a puzzled expression, Helen grabbed Judiel\u2019s hand, as she was sitting next to her. In that manner, every maid from the annex building held each other\u2019s hands.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dJudiel shook her head, feeling Helen and the other maid\u2019s wet and trembling hands.\u2018But they really don\u2019t need to worry about him at all.\u2019Raon was a monster.He was still weaker than countless strong warriors that she had encountered so far, but his temperament was on another level.She would never be able to forget Raon\u2019s gaze, the one that she witnessed that day. Remembering the fear and murderous intent dominating the space still gave her goosebumps.He was the real deal.He wasn\u2019t someone that could ever lose to that fake, the one that was just violent and nothing more.As Judiel was reminiscing about the day she witnessed Raon\u2019s true face, the ringmaster announced the start of the Sword Duel.\u201cHmph!\u201dHelen, who was sitting next to her, clasped her hand.Bam!Raden\u2019s flexible sword was extremely flashy right off the bat. Despite spectating from far away, she was able to feel its sharpness and ever-changing nature.On the other hand, Raon was using\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0and\u00a0River Footwork, both of which were just too honest.It looked like he was in an extremely precarious situation, like a flower petal fluttering inside a tornado.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cAah\u2026\u201dSylvia and Helen\u2019s hands were shaking intensely.\u2018They are all mistaken.\u2019Judiel licked her lips. Raon\u2019s eyes were the same as the time that he had suppressed her.Baam!Raden\u2019s technique was so flashy, to a point that it looked like he was bragging. The moment his aura blade twisted like a rose vine to attack Raon, he used the\u00a0River Footwork.It was a basic footwork that even she could use, yet he managed to dodge Raden\u2019s varied technique and rushed at him from the right side.Raden kept watching from the front as if he didn\u2019t even notice, and Raon got his neck.\u201cH-he won! He won, my lady!\u201d\u201cKyaaah!\u201dHelen and the maids screamed in joy as Raon\u2019s sword was right by Raden\u2019s neck.\u201cAww\u2026\u201dSylvia sighed, still holding on the handrail. She seemed happier about the fact that Raon wasn\u2019t hurt, rather than his victory itself.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dJudiel exclaimed. She knew he was going to win, but she didn\u2019t expect him to win so easily.\u2018He is really a m\u2026 huh?\u2019In the middle of her admiration, she saw Raon pulling back his sword and punching Raden\u2019s mouth.Raden bounced back while bleeding from his mouth, but he hadn\u2019t become any weaker. All it did was make him angrier, his aura gushing out like fire.\u201cWh-why?\u201dSylvia screamed. It should\u2019ve ended right there as his overwhelming victory. She couldn\u2019t understand why he had let him go.Raden turned his wrist to shoot his flexible sword at Raon\u2019s heart, wriggling like a snake.Raon stepped back with\u00a0River Footwork, but Raden\u2019s flexible sword kept following him. It almost looked like tracking magic was used.Raden\u2019s sword wriggled towards Raon\u2019s heart, but his expression stayed indifferent. He flowed like a lotus flower on the water to reach Raden\u2019s left side.Raon\u2019s sword was at Raden\u2019s neck once again, then he slapped his cheek this time.It was the second time. Raon let Raden off the hook even though he could have won once again.Raden now looked like an enraged monster as he swung his flexible sword. However, Raon didn\u2019t change in the slightest. He dodged the sword and dominated him from the front with a peaceful expression on his face.Smack!Raon kicked Raden\u2019s face so hard that the sound reached the stands.Helen bit her lip. She finally realized why Raon was letting him go.\u2018He is taking revenge for us.\u2019Raon was returning Raden\u2019s misdeeds in the annex building, one by one.Punching his mouth first was revenge for his lie about sending a letter, and slapping his face was for spitting on the ground. And what he did just then was for trampling on the flowers.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAn unbearable emotion seeped into her heart.Bloodline was equal to strength in Zieghart. Sylvia was the only person that treated her properly, as she wasn\u2019t even a collateral\u2014let alone a member of the direct line.She had realized that cruel reality when Sylvia had left the house, the fact that she was the only person who treated the maids as human beings in that entire cold earth.However, there was now one other person. The person that was with her from the moment of his birth, Raon, son of Sylvia.He was fighting against a member of the direct line for their sake and crushing them.She couldn\u2019t hold back her tears, sensing Raon\u2019s intentions.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dHearing the sound of someone trying not to cry, Helen turned her head. The other maids were also shedding tears, noticing Raon\u2019s intentions.Everyone was feeling the same emotions. They were moved to tears because it was the first time someone had cared for them so much.And Sylvia was proudly watching Raon, her mouth tightly closed. It was the same confident expression as before she had lost her aura and swordsmanship.However, Sylvia was actually more delighted than Helen thought.She had always been daunted because no one had cared for her since she was born. She was left out in the cold like she never existed, despite being a member of the direct line.Her father, her brothers, and the house all weighed down on her\u2014suffocating her.That was why she had decided to run away. She ran away from the family to obtain her freedom.\u2018However.\u2019That wasn\u2019t the correct answer. She should\u2019ve overcome it with her own strength, no matter how terrible that place was.And that was what her son Raon was telling her.He was born weaker than anyone, yet his mind was now stronger than anyone else\u2019s. Such a boy was telling her with his back that it didn\u2019t matter who his opponent was, he would fight until the very end so that they wouldn\u2019t dare try anything funny.\u201cRaon\u2026\u201dFeeling her turbulent emotion, Sylvia clenched her fist.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Creak!Balder ground his teeth while looking down on the training ground.\u201cHow is this happening?\u201dHe thought Raden\u2019s victory had already been decided.And that wasn\u2019t just his opinion. More than ninety percent of the people in the training ground must\u2019ve expected Raden\u2019s overwhelming victory.However, it was completely different once the fight began.Raden was one-sidedly getting beaten up by Raon, who was using lower-grade swordsmanship and footwork.The fight would\u2019ve been already over after the first clash if Raon desired it. That was how much of a difference there was between the two of them.Whoosh!Raon split apart the last technique of Raden\u2019s\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword, using the plain\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0and\u00a0River Footwork.\u201cThat\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201dBalder unconsciously gasped. He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes as Raon Zieghart\u2019s sword displayed the true purpose of the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword.One needed to infuse the sword with their will in order to achieve the true purpose of swordsmanship. Only those at an advanced level Expert or higher were capable of doing that.\u2018Yet, he\u2026\u2019He had become an Expert only recently, and he was just a fifteen-year-old boy. It felt like a dream, a terrifying nightmare.Raden was unable to think rationally, and he could never pierce through Raon\u2019s sword in his state. The Sword Duel was already over, in an opposite way from what he had expected.\u2018A genius. No, he is more than that.\u2019The continent was vast, and geniuses were numerous.Not just Zieghart, every armed organization regardless of its size had someone called a genius.Raon couldn\u2019t be described by a word like that. A monster that grows by devouring geniuses, he was a devil that would stand at the apex of the continent with his sword.\u2018A mere collateral!\u2019The fact that he was winning against his son made him boil with anger. Even though he was Sylvia\u2019s son, he was just an inferior boy from the seed of an unknown origin.\u201cThat bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cWooow! I hit the jackpot!\u201dAs he was about to spread his pressure, somebody started yelling in a light and unpolished voice right next to him. It was Rimmer\u2019s voice.\u201cMy. Life\u2019s. Turning. Around!\u201dHe kept shouting in joy, swinging the papers he was holding in both hands.\u201cShut up already!\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh no, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRimmer bowed while scratching his head. However, his gaze was as frightening as a warrior about to fight.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you that Raon was going to win.\u201dHe moved next to Balder and grinned.\u201cYou are going to spend a lot of money and time to prepare the reward for the bet. Well, I\u2019ve already won a lot without that.\u201dRimmer giggled and pointed at the papers he was holding. They were proof of the bets he had made with different people.\u201cI told you to shut up.\u201dBalder\u2019s atmosphere became as sharp as a polished blade. He looked like he was about to attack him at any moment.\u201cSince you must\u2019ve already realized the fight is over, I\u2019m going to leave after telling you one thing.\u201dRimmer came up right under Balder\u2019s nose.\u201cMany people are going to be watching Raon from today onward. Never touch Raon or the annex building unless you are confident that you can avoid all those eyes.\u201d\u201cHow dare you\u2026\u201dBalder frowned. Rimmer\u2019s eyes were no different from back in the day, when he was called the Sword of Light. His eyes glowed fiercely, like a father wolf angry at seeing his son hurt.\u201cInstead of me, you should be afraid of the head of house. You know he really hates people who break their promises.\u201dHis frightening pressure disappeared in an instant, and he left like a giggling loafer.\u2018He is right.\u2019Both Raon and the annex building would become difficult to deal with unless he took care of him before the rumor spread.\u2018And\u2026\u2019His two sons and the other direct lineage nieces and nephews would be overshadowed by him. That was how dangerous he was.\u2018Raden!\u2019Balder secretly used aura to send Raden a message.\u2018Forget about sharpness and variety! Use strength! Break him with power! Use what you are better at to your advantage!\u2019He conveyed a hint to defeat Raon. It could become problematic in the future but winning was the highest priority for now.\u2018Win! I\u2019ll deal with the rest somehow!\u2019***\u2018Hmm?\u2019Raon narrowed his eyes. He thought Raden had given up, yet his will had returned to his eyes as he stood back up.He wasn\u2019t spreading his aura anymore, surrounding his sword with it instead, as if he was using a normal sword.\u2018I see.\u2019The\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0had noticed a faint aura flowing down from the stands. He thought it wasn\u2019t anything special, but it looked like Balder had told him the way to win.\u2018Like father, like son.\u2019Raon turned around to look at Balder, who was pretending he did nothing.A Sword Duel was a match of pride and might between the two swordsmen.He was completely shameless, despite having interfered in that noble fight. It looked like he was telling him he could do anything since he was a member of the direct line and Glenn\u2019s son.\u201cKuh\u2026\u201dRaden\u2019s eyes were the same as Balder\u2019s. He gathered all his remaining aura in his sword, just like he was advised.Whir!His posture wasn\u2019t that of\u00a0Crystal Flexible Sword\u00a0as he glared at\u00a0Raon. It looked like Balder\u2019s dirty interference was indeed effective.\u201cYes, I should\u2019ve done this from the beginning.\u201dRaden spat his bloody saliva and growled. His straightened flexible sword was burning in an intense aura blade.\u201cI should\u2019ve beaten you up with the most advantageous method to me!\u201dIt was true, since the amount of Raden\u2019s aura was a lot bigger than Raon\u2019s.\u2018However.\u2019Just like powerful technique wasn\u2019t everything, the amount of aura wasn\u2019t a decisive factor either.\u201cDo you think you can win in a fight of power?\u201d\u201cOf course! I\u2019ll shred your weak aura to pieces!\u201dRaden pounced at him and swung his flexible sword. The powerful strike looked like it could split the ground in half.Clench.Raon brandished his sword. The small flame ignited at the point of his sword multiplied itself and burned.Clang!A flaming sword that melted the atmosphere clashed with the flexible sword surrounded by a green aura.\u201cGasp!\u201dRaden grit his teeth. The shock was making him nauseous. He couldn\u2019t believe his power would increase that much just from multiplying the flames.\u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes burned crimson, just like his sword.Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation,\u00a0Ten Flames.\u00a0Extending Strike.The dancing red flame dashed through the blade to burn up Raden\u2019s aura and pierce the flexible sword.Clang!The flexible sword was shattered into pieces, and Raden\u2019s eyes looked like they would burst out of his head.\u201cN-no way!\u201d\u201cWhere are you trying to go?\u201dRaden stepped back, trying to withdraw, but Raon was faster.\u201cW-wait! I lo\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still two more times to go.\u201dRaon smashed the fist holding his sword into Raden\u2019s mouth.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dRaden\u2019s teeth came out like corn kernels, and he collapsed back with his eyes rolled up.\u201cI\u2019ll spare you the last one with this.\u201dRaon waved his sword. As the flame on his sword was extinguished, the entire training ground fell silent.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96The training ground remained silent as Raden collapsed with his teeth broken and the beautiful flame filling the space was extinguished.\u201cWahhh!\u201d\u201cRaon! Raooon!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cHe won! Young master Raon won!\u201dThe first ones to break the silence were Sylvia and the annex building\u2019s maids. Since they were the most distressed about the situation, they looked like they would break into tears and run into the training ground.\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cKyaaa!\u201dWithout minding the glares of the members of the direct line and collaterals, they screamed and shouted in joy.Their clear voice was a shout of freedom, breaking from the oppression they\u2019d been receiving so far.\u201cRaooon!\u201d\u201cWoahhhh!\u201dThe shouts that followed came out from different locations in the training ground. They were the voices of the trainees that had been with Raon for over three years.\u201cSir Raon!\u201d\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cRawrrr!\u201dDirect line, collateral, vassal family, and even the recommended children from outside shouted out Raon\u2019s name in unison.\u201cHmph! Th-that\u2019s the least he should do. He is the top trainee, after all.\u201dBurren leaned back in his chair and nodded.\u201cI knew from the beginning that he was going to win.\u201d\u201cHmm, but didn\u2019t you shout too much to be saying that?\u201dBurren\u2019s butler tilted his head while keeping a smile on his face.\u201c\u2018Raon, I\u2019m not going to forgive you if you lose here. I\u2019m the only one you are going to lose against!\u2019 That\u2019s what you said in the beginning.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2018Fight, break it! Take that bastard down a peg!\u2019 That\u2019s what you said earlier, and when the young master Raden collapsed, you shouted with a \u2018Waaaah!\u2019\u201d\u201cS-stop it!\u201dBurren wrinkled his red face.\u2018I-I don\u2019t remember it\u2026\u2019It seemed he was too excited since he couldn\u2019t remember that at all.However, he didn\u2019t think he was wrong. Since Raon became the fifth training ground\u2019s top trainee instead of him, it was only natural for him to beat up a sorry excuse of a member of the direct line like him.\u201cI-I\u2019m not the only one who did that. Every trainee is shouting Raon\u2019s name right now\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph, so you couldn\u2019t control your emotion and shouted like that. You\u2019re still a baby.\u201dMartha, who was sitting in front of him, glanced back and sneered.\u201cYou are really pathetic. You should bring a paci around from now on, and don\u2019t tell anyone you know me.\u201d\u201cKeuh, Martha Zieghart\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Martha.\u201dBurren\u2019s butler pointed at the handrail in front of Martha. The handrail should\u2019ve been a cylindrical shape, yet it was distorted with a clearly visible mark\u2014one left behind by a fist.\u201cDidn\u2019t you clasp that with your hand? It looks like Lady Martha was quite excited as well.\u201d\u201cN-no I wasn\u2019t. What kind of bullshit is that?\u201dMartha violently shook her head, swearing with a clearly flustered expression.\u201cWhy would I get excited from watching such a low-level Sword Duel? Hah, are you taking me for a snotty kid or something?\u201dShe denied it wholeheartedly.\u201cMartha, it\u2019s pointless to pretend you weren\u2019t. I also heard you shouting foul language.\u201d\u201cYou are the one who was pretending. Fight me if you don\u2019t like it!\u201d\u201cRaon.\u201dBurren and Martha, who were growling at each other, turned their heads at once upon hearing a thin voice coming from the bottom.\u201cRaon.\u201dWith her hands around her mouth, Runaan Sullion kept calling Raon\u2019s name.\u201cRaon.\u201dThere was no way he could hear her even with her hands there, yet Runaan kept shouting Raon\u2019s name.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAfter seeing Runaan, who was definitely and honestly cheering for Raon, Martha and Burren lowered their hands.\u201cTsk. There was no point in watching this Sword Duel. It was such a low-level fight.\u201dMartha awkwardly scratched her head and stood up.\u201cHey, dead fish eyes!\u201dShe put her feet on the chairs in front of her, where the swordsmen from before were sitting.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? That the results would be interesting.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2026\u201dThe swordsmen ducked their heads, unable to respond.\u201cIf your skills are bad, you should at least be tactful. But since you have dead fish eyes, you\u2019d better train a lot in order to survive in the future.\u201dAfter laughing at the swordsmen, she left the training ground.\u201cWhat a temper.\u201dBurren shook his head and stood up. Martha only acted docile in front of Raon, and she had become more violent than before towards the others.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe turned his head to look at Raon standing at the center of the training ground.The way he was confidently standing as he looked around the training ground reminded him of how he stopped the Blood Raving Demon on his own.\u2018I\u2019ll never be able to forget that. I\u2019m going to repay that debt throughout the rest of my life. However, I\u2019ll never give up.\u2019Burren clenched his fist and stared at Raon\u2019s back.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely catch up to you.\u201d***\u201cHmm!\u201dGlenn heaved himself up from the chair\u2019s backrest. His pupils were bigger than usual, and his eyebrows were lowered.It was an extreme reaction when one considers how rarely he changed his expression.\u201cM-my lord.\u201dRoenn looked back at Glenn with a trembling chin.\u201cThe thing the young master used in the beginning, in the middle of the\u00a0River Footwork\u2014wasn\u2019t that the\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps?\u201d\u201c\u2026It was.\u201d\u201cGasp!\u201dRoenn had always kept a smile on his face, yet his collected expression was broken. He exclaimed at the ridiculousness of what Raon had done.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn furrowed his brows. What surprised him the most that day wasn\u2019t the fact that Raon had defeated Raden with an overwhelming difference.It was the fact that he had used the\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps\u00a0that he was only taught two weeks prior.The\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Harmony Steps\u00a0was a footwork that Glenn had created once he had reached transcendence after breaking through the demonic wall. It was an advanced martial art that an average martial artist wouldn\u2019t even be able to learn, even if they tried for their entire lifetime.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Raon managed to acquire it in only two weeks.That was amazing enough for Glenn to be awestruck and surprised, despite how he didn\u2019t show much emotion.\u2018I thought it would take him at least half a year.\u2019Glenn gasped, looking at Raon standing there confidently. He had expected him to use it in half a year at the earliest.\u2018Two weeks, huh.\u2019It was his first time making a mistake after he reached transcendence. It was absurd, but it was making him smile.\u2018And the swordsmanship\u2026\u2019Raon used the true meaning of the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword\u00a0at the end. A fifteen-year-old boy, one who wasn\u2019t even qualified as a swordsman yet, had used the true meaning of the swordsmanship. It was impossible for him to not be surprised.\u201cH-he is really amazing. The\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps, the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword, and the flame at the end\u2026\u201dRoenn was too astonished to finish his sentence.\u201cAhem, it\u2019s not that amazing. The\u00a0Supreme Harmony Steps\u00a0is only at one star, and the beginning of the first star at that. He also still has a way to go with the\u00a0Star Connecting Sword. If\u00a0Raden had used another flexible sword technique, he wouldn\u2019t have lost so easily.\u201dGlenn hid his surprised expression and shook his head with his usual appearance.\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s not that amazing. My lord\u2019s face is\u2026 Heh.\u201dRoenn smiled wryly with his eyes and hid his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m telling you it\u2019s not.\u201dGlenn turned his head while caressing his cheeks. It seems Roenn\u2019s personality was taking after Rimmer after hanging around with him so much recently.[Th-the Sword Duel ends with Raon Zieghart\u2019s victory!]The ringmaster, who had been standing dumbfounded, remembered his role and declared Raon\u2019s victory. People started to shout from everywhere.\u201cWoaaah!\u201d\u201cRaon!\u201d\u201cRaooon!\u201dThe young voices were from the children.\u201cThose children\u2026\u201dThe trainees that had been with Raon were all shouting in unison regardless of their position; direct line, collateral, vassal family, and recommended children from the outside.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time witnessing such a thing. No, I think it's the first time ever that everyone is cheering for a collateral.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dGlenn slowly nodded.\u2018Indeed\u2026\u2019There were occasions of a collateral getting achievements or winning a duel, but it was the first time one was getting cheered for by direct line, collateral, vassal family, and recommended children at the same time.It was a day with lots of mysterious occurrences.\u201cI wish the others can become one like them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGlenn didn\u2019t respond. Since he used to rule over the place as a dictator when he was infected with demonic energy, such a thing was impossible for him.He segregated them by might and blood for a long time, and he was too old to change that now.However, he could see the light.If it was Raon, he thought he would one day change the house. After all, he knew about the unfair treatment collaterals received despite being born as a member of the direct line.\u201cMy lord, the Sword Duel has ended!\u201dThe ringmaster knelt under the platform and bowed. Everyone in the training ground looked at Glenn.\u201cHmm!\u201dGlenn stood. It was time to celebrate the victor, although he needed to take care of the cheater that interfered with the noble fight first.Whir!Glenn\u2019s threatening gaze was directed at Balder, sitting at the west.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]* * *Raon walked up to the platform along with the ringmaster, who was supporting the unconscious Raden.\u2018He looks scary.\u2019Glenn was even more expressionless than usual. It seemed he was displeased with the current situation, as a frightening atmosphere was surrounding him.\u2018Is it because of my victory, or\u2026\u2019He was already aware of the fact that Glenn disliked him. However, he would never fail to reward a merit or let a fault go unpunished.Even if he was displeased with his victory, he shouldn\u2019t have been petty enough to plainly act frightening.Rumble!Glenn stood up on the platform, and the training ground\u2019s atmosphere grew extremely dry. It felt like he was in a library, as not a single sound could be heard.\u201cRaon Zieghart has won today\u2019s Sword Duel.\u201d\u201cWoaaah!\u201dThe trainees shouted even louder as Glenn declared it, although most of the direct lines and collaterals remained silent while watching them.\u201cI\u2019m going to reveal the condition Raon Zieghart had in this Sword Duel.\u201dThe condition set by each swordsman during a Sword Duel was revealed after the match. People grew silent, looking forward to hearing the condition.\u201cRaon Zieghart wanted Raden to kneel down and apologize to Sylvia and the annex building\u2019s maids for the problems he has caused in the annex building. He also wanted the True Martial Palace to never interfere with the annex building.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dPeople remained speechless as they stared at Raon.\u201cWas that the condition?\u201d\u201cAn apology?\u201d\u201cHuh? An apology to the maids\u201dThe usual condition of a Sword Duel was everything the opponent possessed.Since it was a battle of pride, it would usually be the opponent\u2019s wealth, their best weapon, or breaking their arms or energy center.However, Raon only wanted an apology, and not one directed at him on top of it. He just wanted an apology to his mother and worthless maids.People were shocked, as it was their first time hearing such a condition. They could only stare at Raon dumbfounded.\u201cApology in a Sword Duel? He is a fool.\u201d\u201cI know right? He is just like Sylvia.\u201dDirect lines and powerful collaterals laughed at him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe vassal families didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cRaon Zieghart, huh\u2026?\u201dPowerless collaterals that were ousted from the center, and the swordsmen from the outside that had been weak from the beginning, engraved Raon\u2019s name deep into their minds.\u201cSince the Sword Duel is over, that condition shall be fulfilled.\u201d\u201cKeuh!\u201dGlenn flicked his finger and Raden, who was lying flat on the ground, coughed up blood and opened his eyes.\u201cWh-where am I? Argh! Wh-why am I here\u2026?\u201dSince his teeth were broken, Raden was helplessly lisping.\u201cSylvia and the maids from the annex buildings shall step forward.\u201dSylvia, Helen, and the maids stood up straight upon hearing Glenn\u2019s order. They were just standing there, trying to read the atmosphere.\u201cCome down to the training ground.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dSylvia nodded. She led the maids to the training ground.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cH-how did this happen?\u201d\u201cMy lady, I\u2019m too nervous to walk.\u201dSince they weren\u2019t used to being the center of attention, they were nervous as they hesitantly walked up to the platform.Raon turned around to meet Sylvia, Helen, and the maids\u2019 eyes. He told them with his eyes that everything was okay, so they could proudly walk up.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone calm down. We didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201dIt seemed his gaze had an effect, since Sylvia and the maids started walking more naturally. They stood next to Raon and bowed at Glenn.\u201cWe have arrived.\u201dGlenn nodded and looked down on Raden, who was still out of his mind.\u201cRaden Zieghart.\u201d\u201cEh? Ah, yes!\u201d\u201cThe Sword Duel has ended with your loss.\u201d\u201cAh, aah\u2026\u201dRaden, who finally realized his defeat, trembled.\u201cRaden Zieghart, respect the condition of the Sword Duel. Kneel down and apologize to Sylvia and the maids.\u201d\u201cG-grandfather!\u201dRaden violently shook his head and knelt towards Glenn instead of Sylvia.\u201cI-I\u2019m a member of the direct line with a swordsman\u2019s qualification. How can you ask me to kneel down to maids that aren\u2019t even collaterals?\u201cYou are the one who made that promise. Since you lose the Sword Duel, you have to keep your promise.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, I-I\u2026\u201d\u201cWe are at an official event. Call me your lord.\u201d\u201cM-my lord! Please forgive me! I can win next ti\u2026\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be begging forgiveness to me, but to them. Keep your word as a member of Zieghart\u2019s direct line, Raden Zieghart.\u201dGlenn frowned. The coarse atmosphere became even more dreary. Goosebumps appeared on his forearm, as if a storm were about to break.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRaden\u2019s whole body trembled, weighed down by his pressure. He looked at his father, Balder, but he also shook his head.\u2018D-damn it! Damn it!\u2019He swore on the inside. It was all Raon\u2019s fault. That son of a bitch had messed everything up.\u2018I\u2019m going to kill you, no matter what! Even if I have to give up everything, I\u2019ll ki\u2026 ugh!\u2019His hair stood on end upon seeing Raon as he was standing up. His heart was pounding too heavily, to the point that he couldn\u2019t meet his eyes.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dHis entire body hurt from getting beaten up by him. His lungs were shrinking so much that he couldn\u2019t breathe, and he was too scared to look into his eyes.\u2018F-fear? Am I really afraid of a guy like him?\u2019That was the only possibility.\u201cArgh!\u201dHe raised his head because he couldn\u2019t admit that fact, but his stomach became upset and he wanted to throw up as soon as he met Raon\u2019s eyes.It was a natural outcome since the martial arts he had learned throughout his entire life was defeated, and he was beaten up countless times even after losing in terms of power.\u201cGo. Go and kneel down before them.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBecause of the gaze closer and more frightening than Glenn, Raden walked up to Sylvia without saying anything back.\u2018I\u2019m going to kill you all no matter what.\u2019Even though he couldn\u2019t look straight at Raon\u2019s eyes, he bit his lip with the determination of killing them.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I apologize.\u201dHe lowered his head enough to hide the fact that he was gritting his teeth.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSylvia didn\u2019t say anything, and the maids awkwardly bowed back.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to lower your heads.\u201dRaon surrounded the maids with the aura from the\u00a0Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation. The color returned to the maids\u2019 pale faces.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cRaon.\u201d\u201cSir R-Raon.\u201d\u201cWe are getting an apology today.\u201dRaon calmed Sylvia and the maids, then walked up to Raden.\u201cDo it over, Raden Zieghart.\u201d\u201cWh-what?\u201d\u201cThe condition was to kneel down and apologize. Kneel down and lower your head.\u201d\u201cAre you seriously not in your right mind? After this, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201cDo it again.\u201d\u201cKeuh!\u201dRaon\u2019s voice became deeper, and Raden started trembling. The fear of Raon was carved into his body.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dRaden looked around, but nobody could help him. It felt like Glenn\u2019s frightening gaze was urging him to continue.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dRaden bit his lip with his few remaining teeth and knelt.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cTell them what you did wrong. I\u2019m sure I taught you what it was.\u201dHe was right. He told him what the problem was each time he beat him up with his fist and sword. Since it hurt too much, he remembered every single one.\u201cI-I sent a fake letter, trampled on flowers, spat on her hand, struck the maid\u2019s cheek, k-kicked her with my foot. I-I one-sidedly picked a fight with the annex building. I-I\u2019m sor\u2026keuh.\u201dBecause his pride was hurt while being suppressed by fear in his injured state, he fainted once again.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dRaon smiled at the maids, whose faces were blue with worry.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure nobody can mess with the annex building, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cSniff\u2026\u201d\u201cSniff!\u201dThe maids finally burst into tears.\u201cRaon\u2026\u201dSylvia bit her lip and grabbed Raon\u2019s hand tightly.\u201cMy lord, there\u2019s still more to the condition. I want you to confirm it personally.\u201d\u201cOf course. But before that\u2026\u201dGlenn\u2019s frightening gaze was directed at Balder.\u201cI need to take care of the person who interfered with the noble Sword Duel.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked irritated, but he didn\u2019t seem flustered.\u2018So, he was aware of it.\u2019Raon nodded, looking at the grunting Balder. Since he had noticed what Balder had done, there was no way Glenn wouldn\u2019t have realized it.\u201cAnswer, Balder Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cA Sword Duel is Zieghart\u2019s tradition and honor, passed down for a thousand years. Are you looking down on me so much that you thought you were allowed to dirty it with your petty trick?\u201dGlenn\u2019s voice had become softer, but his pressure soared like an explosion.Rumble!It felt like there was an earthquake as the entire training ground trembled, and the atmosphere weighed heavily on his shoulders.\u201cKeuh\u2026\u201dBalder faltered, unable to withstand Glenn\u2019s tremendous pressure. He barely managed to regain his balance, but he couldn\u2019t hide his trembling shoulders.\u201cI-I beg your pardon.\u201dBalder tightly bit his lips and bowed to Glenn.\u201cHowever, as a father I was just cheering for my son. I told him nothing that could change the outcome\u2026\u201d\u201cBalder Zieghart.\u201dGlenn\u2019s eyes were a burning crimson, much like an erupting volcano.\u201cDo you have a death wish?\u201dA frightening murderous intent spread out in an instant.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s back curled in. Even though the murderous intent wasn\u2019t directed at him, he had goosebumps and the strength left his body.\u201cYou told Raden to fight with power. You told him to break through with sheer strength, giving up on variety and sharpness. Do you really believe that I would\u2019ve missed such a sloppy aura message?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBalder\u2019s body bent gradually. It wasn't his own doing, but Glenn\u2019s shapeless pressure that was forcing him that way.Raon swallowed. Glenn\u2019s pressure was thrilling enough, but there was something more surprising.\u2018Did he just say he read the aura message?\u2019An aura message was a special technique that transmitted words using the aura from the energy center or heart.That meant that its ability to ensure secrecy was top notch, yet Glenn was saying that he had read the message.\u2018That\u2019s crazy.\u2019He didn\u2019t infer from the situation, but actually read the aura message. That meant that space itself was in his hand.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dThat was so ridiculous that he gasped despite the seriousness of the situation.\u201cYou must\u2019ve thought you could cover it up after the Sword Duel even if you were found out. Since you are my son, the True Martial Palace\u2019s master, and the division leader of the Flexible Sword division, you must\u2019ve believed that I would just let it pass.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBalder trembled even more as Glenn continued speaking. The trembling of his hand made it look like he was suffering from hand tremors.\u201cBut you crossed the line this time. You dirtied the duel and lied to me.\u201d\u201cI-I beg your pardon! F-Father, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI order you, as Zieghart\u2019s head of house.\u201dGlenn raised his chin, looking down on Balder, who was curled up like a worm.Slam!Every swordsman of Zieghart knelt at once, and the entire training ground trembled.\u201cI sentence Balder Zieghart to one year\u2019s probation, during which he can\u2019t leave the True Martial Palace. The True Martial Palace and the Flexible Sword division\u2019s budget will be confiscated for one year, and their activities will also be halted for a year.\u201d\u201cBy your order!\u201dEvery swordsman shouted the same phrase and bowed. It was such a magnificent sight, enough to make people tremble.\u201cF-Father! One year is too much! And having the True Martial Palace and the Flexible Sword division punished along with me is too harsh!\u201d\u201cHarsh?\u201dCrimson lightning jolted from Glenn\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou disgraced my name and belittled Zieghart\u2019s history. One year of probation is as light as a feather compared to what you have done.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the True Martial Palace\u2019s master. I\u2019m in charge of so many missions and work! Without me\u2026\u201d\u201cHow laughable. Do you think you are the only one? There\u2019s no problem with leaving your work to the other palaces.\u201d\u201cF-Father?\u201dColor left Balder\u2019s face, as if he suddenly bled out dry.\u201cThen shall I break your energy center instead of the probation, as that was your son\u2019s condition for the Sword Duel?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you a choice. One year of probation or your energy center.\u201dGlenn\u2019s cruel pressure was telling him he had no intention of forgiving him.\u201c\u2026I-I\u2019ll take the probation.\u201dBalder answered, his body curled up. It looked like he couldn\u2019t even breathe properly as he was suppressed by Glenn\u2019s pressure.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled roughly. He felt exhausted from just watching it.\u2018He is really amazing.\u2019Most houses didn\u2019t punish members of the direct line for their mistakes. They just covered them up slyly.Robert's house was the same, despite being one of the Six Kings. Zieghart was different.Zieghart\u2019s head of house punished Balder despite him being his fourth son and the house\u2019s executive at the same time, and rather severely at that.Glenn Zieghart was more coldblooded than he\u2019d thought.\u201cAdditionally.\u201dGlenn turned to look at the entire training ground rather than Balder.\u201cThere were two conditions in today\u2019s Sword Duel. If you are instigated by Balder, the True Martial Palace, or the Flexible Sword division to harm the annex building, I\u2019ll be punishing you personally. You shall only act if you are confident that you can hide it from me.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe vassals bowed once again and responded loud and clear.\u201cThere were some unsavory incidents, but the Sword Duel is now over. Everyone shall leave now.\u201dGlenn left the training ground after saying that.\u201cSniff\u2026\u201dTears flowed down from Helen\u2019s eyes, ones she had been holding back until the end.\u201cWaah!\u201dHelen grabbed Sylvia\u2019s hand and started wailing.She must\u2019ve been feeling burdened as she was directly involved with the incident, and it seemed her suppressed emotions had exploded once everything was resolved.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dTears were also welling up in Sylvia\u2019s eyes as she patted Helen's back.\u201cAww\u2026\u201d\u201cSniff!\u201d\u201cMy lady! Head maid!\u201dThe other maids also started crying after Helen and Sylvia. Since Glenn had officially announced that the others should not meddle with the annex building as the head of house, their worries had disappeared and their tension was eased.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon felt relieved, as he finally had the ability to protect them.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you that everything would be alright.\u201dRaon smiled, pretending he had never been nervous. He continued while looking at them crying and smiling at the same time.\u201cLet\u2019s return home.\u201d***The training ground fell silent after the spectators left.Six people remained in front of the western passage. Zieghart\u2019s flame sword emblem was engraved on the left side of their chests, and a different emblem was engraved underneath for each of them.It signified that they were the division leaders that had entrusted their will to Zieghart\u2019s emblem.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen something so amazing in a long time.\u201d\u201cI thought Rimmer was joking when I heard that he killed the Green War Demon and survived a fight against the Blood Raving Demon, but the rumor was true.\u201d\u201cIt would be an understatement to call him the real deal. Even though it was a low-grade swordsmanship, he managed to use its true meaning. He can\u2019t be described as a mere talent at this point.\u201d\u201cHe will be useful immediately if he joins my division.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe division leaders nodded at once, as they had all felt the same thing about Raon.\u201cThe swordsmanship was amazing, but he had something mixed in with the River Footwork. I\u2019m not exactly sure, but his martial arts isn\u2019t at an Expert\u2019s level anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat a genius. I knew he was most suited to join my Black Tiger\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck off.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe two female division leaders standing at both sides interrupted him.\u201cHmph. Anyway, he certainly grew up better than we expected.\u201dThe division leader at the center awkwardly cleared his throat and scratched the back of his head.\u201cYes. I thought he was a fragile genius, but he is a healthy monster. He will definitely face the other direct lines if he keeps growing like that. It\u2019s very interesting.\u201dThe division leader with a deep voice licked his lips.\u201cSince he is going to graduate soon, the Black Tiger should train him from now on. I like his personality, and I\u2019m confident I can raise him we\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBlack Tiger, do you have a death wish?\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dThree out of the four others glared at him, and the division leader at the center ducked his head.\u201cHe isn\u2019t completely wrong. It\u2019s true that the fifth training ground trainees will soon graduate. They will become swordsmen as soon as they pass the graduation exam, and they will get to choose their squad and division.\u201dThe division leader with a deep voice snickered while holding onto the handrail.\u201cAnd there is more than Raon in the fifth training ground. Burren, Runaan, and Martha, all three of them have might and talent that can become the best no matter where they are. The next Selection Ceremony is going to be interesting.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe division leaders didn\u2019t say anything, but they had the same resolution. They had to bring in one of the four people during the next Selection Ceremony.\u201cBut Raon is still the only one for me!\u201d\u201cWho wants to kill a black tiger today?\u201d\u201cMe.\u201d\u201cCount me in.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Raon returned to the annex building along with Sylvia, Helen, and the maids.\u201cAah\u2026\u201dHelen sighed after looking around the annex building from the front.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dSylvia tilted her head while grabbing her shoulder.\u201cI thought we might not be able to return together like this.\u201dHelen closed her eyes. She had countless thoughts about what could have happened that day.If ever Raon lost, she was going to beg for mercy, even if it cost her own life. Instead, she had received an apology and everyone managed to return together. It felt like a dream.\u201cSame goes for me.\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201dThe maids nodded one after the other. It seemed everyone had the same thing on their minds, and they smiled slightly while looking at each other.\u201cYou can rest assured now, since Father makes sure to keep his promises. No one will dare hurt us anymore.\u201dSylvia turned to meet the maids' eyes, one by one. After that, she finally looked at Raon and smiled widely.\u201cWell, let\u2019s have a party today, using every ingredient we have!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a lot of the stew young master likes!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dSylvia, Helen, and the maids entered the annex building with light, cheerful steps.\u201cHaa.\u201dRaon slightly sighed while looking at them. His uneasiness had completely disappeared after looking at the way they were smiling and laughing.It seemed they had become a lot more important to him than he\u2019d thought.As Raon was about to enter the annex building, one of the maids slowed to be caught up to by him. It was Judiel.\u201cYoung master.\u201dJudiel turned to Raon.\u201cDid you plan all this from the beginning?\u201d\u201cTo a certain extent.\u201dRaon nodded. He hurt Raden\u2019s pride the moment he attacked Raden, since the Sword Duel was the only way out of that situation.He won the Sword Duel as he\u2019d expected and received the apology. However, he didn\u2019t expect the True Martial Palace, the Flexible Sword division, and Balder to be put on probation.\u201cYou really are a scary person.\u201dJudiel\u2019s face turned pale as she sighed.\u201cBut you are also a kind person.\u201d\u201cAm I kind?\u201dRaon raised his eyes. It was his first time being called that, which embarrassed him more than Raden\u2019s attacks.\u201cThank you for saving me back then.\u201dJudiel smiled slightly, her ears turning pink. He had seen her smile many times before, but they had always been fake.However, that time was different. He could feel her shyness in her sincere smile.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dRaon warmed his fingers while watching Judiel\u2019s back as she walked towards the annex building.\u2018It should be fine to reveal the truth now.\u2019***\u201cUrgh!\u201dBalder Zieghart was breathing roughly. The clean and magnificent True Martial Palace was completely destroyed, and the walls were shattered to pieces.The True Martial Palace\u2019s swordsmen had fainted, scattered around the floor.It wasn\u2019t the result of an enemy\u2019s attack.Upon returning from the training ground, Balder couldn\u2019t hold back his anger and started to destroy the True Martial Palace. He beat up the swordsmen that were trying to stop him.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-what shall we do?\u201dThe remaining people didn\u2019t know what to do. It was at that moment that a refreshing wind blew in from the destroyed wall.\u201cHello?\u201dA long finger swayed from the hole the wind came from, and Rimmer\u2019s face poked out.\u201cRimmer\u2026\u201dBalder glared at Rimmer with bloodshot eyes.\u201cWow, this is really neat. You should open your window more often.\u201dRimmer grinned and entered the palace over the destroyed wall.\u201cWhy did you come here? Do you have a death wish?\u201d\u201cGetting probation from the head of house is the same as a suspended sentence, yet you are trying to cause another issue?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBalder, who was about to attack him, bit his lip. It was just as Rimmer said: if he caused another problem, he would receive an unbearable punishment.\u201cGet out of my sight! I have nothing to say to you.\u201d\u201cEven if you have nothing to tell me, you should have something to say to this.\u201dRimmer waved the paper he took from his top.\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201dBalder\u2019s eyes widened upon noticing the fluttering paper.\u201cYou must know about it, right? It\u2019s the proof of the bet between you, the True Martial Palace master, and the worthless me.\u201dRimmer grinned. The way he was talking, his voice, his behavior, everything about him was hateful. He couldn\u2019t understand how such a person was an elf.\u201cSince it will be difficult to meet you once you start your probation, give them to me right now.\u201d\u201cKeuh. I-I don\u2019t have them.\u201dBalder violently shook his head.\u2018I can\u2019t give that to him in this situation.\u2019He had staked too many things in the bet with Rimmer. Since their activities were paused, giving away those items would greatly slow down the True Martial Palace\u2019s growth.\u201cUh-oh. Why do you have to be like this when you should know better?Rimmer clicked his tongue and flicked his finger.\u201cEveryone knows that the True Martial Palace has acquired a large number of elixirs\u2026 Ah, did you already get Alzheimer's because of the shock?\u201d\u201cYou, do you really want to die?\u201dBalder bared his teeth and growled.\u201cOh, no! Don\u2019t do this to me!\u201dRimmer stepped back with an exaggerated expression. Balder wanted to pluck off his stupid swaying ears.\u201cFuck off! I have nothing to give you!\u201d\u201cAre you sure you will be fine with that?\u201dRimmer grinned and shook his hand.\u201cYou\u2019ve disgraced the head of house\u2019s name during the Sword Duel, yet you are not going to keep your promise? I wonder what the head of house is going to think about this.\u201dHe raised his fingers one by one.\u201cThe probation and the activity suspension can be extended to two years, and he might even confiscate all your property.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201dBalder bit his lips.His father could do it the way he was currently. He wanted to pulverize that hateful bastard, but it was truly a shame that he had no means of achieving that.\u201cGive them to me. I still have lots of people to visit after you to collect my rewards.\u201dRimmer smiled, extending both of his hands like a child asking for pocket money.\u201cDaamn iiit!\u201dBalder\u2019s scream resounded throughout the True Martial Palace once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were favorable and hostile gazes mixed in between.That\u2019s the way humans are.Wrath crawled up from the bracelet.They look down on the weak and admire the strong. Humans value strength as much as beasts.\u2018I agree with you quite often recently.\u2019Raon nodded. Just as Wrath said, they were only looking at him because he had proven his strength.Though, not all gazes were favorable. There were also jealousy, hatred, and even vivid murderous intent.\u2018How is devildom? I guess it would be even worse.\u2019Are you curious? Then I\u2019ll tell you about it. It\u2019s a different place than what humans imagine it to be. Though, weaklings get treated worse than livestock.Wrath murmured that there was no place in the world where the weak were favored.You did great this time. You completely destroyed that ugly bastard with your wrath. You even subdued his father. I\u2019m satisfied with your actions for the first time in a long time.\u2018Is that so?\u2019Yes. Except for one thing. It\u2019s a shame that you didn\u2019t kill him. Back in Devildom, the King of Essence turned everyone that dared to offend me into a block of ice\u2026Messages appeared as soon as Wrath finished talking.[Wrath\u00a0has been greatly satisfied.][Perception has increased by 1.][Stamina has increased by 1.]It was telling him his stats had increased because Wrath was satisfied.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect this gift!\u2019Raon\u2019s lips parted. Receiving a reward he didn\u2019t even expect put him in a great mood to start the day with.You cursed system! Why is this the only time you consider the King of Essence your owner?Wrath glared at the system that still wasn\u2019t listening to him and boiled in anger.\u2018Thank you, I\u2019m growing faster thanks to you.\u2019Shut your trap. It makes me angry when you are happy.It hadn\u2019t even been ten seconds since he had said he was satisfied, yet he was already bursting with anger. He was the definition of a personality disorder.\u201cDoes it? It makes me happy, though.\u201dStop right there, you bastard!Raon hummed and entered the training ground. Wrath kept cursing at him, but he didn\u2019t care about him.\u201cHmm?\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes widened upon entering the training ground. The person that shouldn\u2019t have been there yet was sitting on the platform.\u2018Rimmer?\u2019It was the lazy elf that was never there during daybreak training, and who was often late to the morning training.\u201cOh! My lucky charm! How are you, my trainee Raon?\u201dRimmer grinned and extended his hands. There were rings with gemstones shining in different colors on his long fingers.He was also wearing shiny bracelets and a necklace on his wrist and neck.\u2018What?\u2019It was his first time seeing the elf wearing jewelry like that. And they didn\u2019t even seem to be artifacts with a special ability, just expensive decorations.\u2018Lucky charm?\u2019He didn\u2019t understand why he was suddenly called a lucky charm. As he was about to conclude that using the\u00a0Sword Field Creation\u00a0made him go nuts, Burren came up from behind him.\u201cHe gambled.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat guy, I heard he openly gambled during the Sword Duel between you and Raden. Apparently, he won a huge amount because your odds were high.\u201dBurren frowned. It looked like just talking about it made him irritated. He murmured that he wanted to pluck out his eyes.\u2018He did it again.\u2019Raon snickered. He was wondering why he was wearing that jewelry, and it was because he got them by gambling.Gambling, drinking, and being lazy. He was the complete opposite of the elves he\u2019d known before. He was pretty amazing in a way.That arrogant pointy-eared bastard.Wrath ground his teeth while looking at Rimmer.\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019I get angry each time I see him. Your body would\u2019ve been mine if only he wasn\u2019t there\u2026\u2018Aha.\u2019Raon nodded. He\u2019d managed to keep his body thanks to Rimmer, who appeared at that critical moment during the fight against the Blood Raving Demon.Wrath had already called Rimmer arrogant, but it seemed he now hated him.But Raon was aware of Rimmer\u2019s true feelings, unlike Wrath.Even though he looked like a useless loafer on the outside, he carefully observed every single trainee and instructed them with appropriate training.Since he managed to survive thanks to that, he could overlook his gambling on him.\u201cPathetic.\u201dMartha gave him a cold shoulder and turned away from Rimmer, who was bragging about the rings on his hands.Raon turned his head around at a nasal sound from behind him. Runaan was there before he knew it, waving her hand slightly at him with blank eyes.Raon looked around the trainees in the training ground.He remembered them cheering and shouting for him in the training ground. It felt like he was sitting in front of a heater during the cold winter as their voices warmed his heart.It seemed like the people in the fifth training ground were also becoming important to him, on top of those living in the annex building.\u201cOkay, is everyone here?\u201dRimmer stopped bragging about his gems like a\u00a0nouveau riche\u00a0and clapped his hands.He thought he was just trying to get attention like always, but the instructors behind him brought a metal box forward.Thud!Sand scattered around as the box was put on the ground.\u201cGuess what this is.\u201d\u201cDid you also win this with your gambling?\u201d\u201cOh, correct!\u201dRimmer proudly nodded at Burren\u2019s reply.\u201cHaah, we\u2019ve seen enough of them, so stop bragging and let\u2019s start training.\u201d\u201cAh, this is for you.\u201dRimmer came down from the platform with a wide smile. He walked up to the box and put his hand on it.\u201cSorry? This is ours?\u201d\u201cThat box?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201dThe trainees tilted their heads, looking back and forth between Rimmer and the box.\u201cThe king of gambling had two bets. The first was this money! This huge amount of money! Gems! Kuhahaha!\u201dRimmer called himself the king of gambling and bragged about the rings once again.\u201cAnd the second\u2026\u201dHe opened the box while giggling, and the clear scent of medicine that soothed the mind spread from it.Raon furrowed his brow and looked at the box. There were dozens of small wooden boxes inside the big box.\u2018Are they elixirs?\u2019Judging from the luxurious shape and the bitter scent coming from them, they must\u2019ve been elixirs.\u201cThey are elixirs.\u201dRimmer immediately satiated the curiosity of the trainees that were tilting their heads.\u201cE-elixirs?\u201d\u201cAll of them?\u201d\u201cIt looks like there are more than forty of them\u2026\u201dThe trainees\u2019 jaws dropped, examining the boxes that apparently contained elixirs.\u201cYes, and they even contain the Ten Leaf Grass.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cTen Leaf Grass!\u201d\u201cThis many of them?\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe Ten Leaf Grass was a medicinal herb that had its leaves split into ten. It was a precious elixir since it could cleanse the body, energy center, and the mana circuit at the same time, all without any bias in terms of attribute.Since an elixir made from the Ten Leaf Grass had a great balance, it was expensive and difficult to acquire. And yet, there were forty of them in front of their eyes. It was only natural that they would be surprised.\u201cThese are for you.\u201dRimmer raised his chin to the sky. He pointed his finger at the box with an accomplished expression.\u201cI\u2019ve prepared exactly forty-three, so take exactly one per person.\u201d\u201cEek?\u201d\u201cS-seriously? Are they really ours?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dNot just the trainees, even Burren and Martha\u2019s jaws dropped in surprise. Runaan was just standing there blankly, sniffing the elixir like a puppy.\u201cWhy is it so difficult to believe?\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue and threw the elixir box at the top at Raon.Tap.Raon opened the elixir box in confusion. A green bead the size of an adult\u2019s thumb was inside.\u201cIt\u2019s a Ten Cloud Elixir. The amount of mana it contains isn\u2019t extraordinary, but it\u2019s as pure as raw mana. It\u2019s going to help all of you.\u201dRimmer threw the elixirs at the trainees while explaining about the Ten Cloud Elixir.\u201cWhere did you acquire this?\u201dBurren furrowed his brow, checking the Ten Cloud Elixir. One couldn\u2019t simply buy a bunch of elixirs because they had a lot of money. He couldn\u2019t figure out how he obtained all forty-three of them.\u201cI won them.\u201d\u201cD-did you really win them all by gambling?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a gamble but a bet. It\u2019s a bet, I say.\u201dRimmer waved his finger to close the lid of the empty box.\u201cWho did you even make that bet with\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe True Martial Palace master.\u201dHe casually replied, like it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cT-true Martial Palace master is\u2026\u201d\u201cBalder Zieghart!\u201d\u201cUuh!\u201dThe trainees' faces turned pale upon hearing the True Martial Palace master\u2019s name. Some of them even dropped the elixir on the ground in panic.\u201cAh, it\u2019s okay. They can\u2019t afford to pay attention to us right now. They must be thinking that I will sell them all off, so there won\u2019t be any harm to you guys.\u201dRimmer reassured them and told them to take the elixir and cultivate their aura for the rest of the day.\u2018Hah\u2026\u2019Raon gasped. He had obtained forty-three elixirs by straight up making a bet against Balder, who was the True Martial Palace\u2019s master and Glenn\u2019s son at the same time. That elf was seriously as eccentric as himself.\u201cThank you.\u201dBut he had to express his gratitude. Raon bowed at Rimmer while giving him his thanks.\u201cTh-thank you, instructor.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dThe trainees excitedly followed Raon and showed their gratitude.\u201cHmm. I see, I see.\u201dRimmer smiled widely and waved his hand.\u201cThank you for the treat.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dBurren didn\u2019t have his usual sour expression as he bowed, and Martha also lowered her head while fiddling with the elixir.Elixirs truly were amazing, to make those peculiar guys react the same way.\u201cWell then, you can return. I\u2019m not telling you that because of my hangover, but it\u2019s better to take the elixirs right away.\u201dRimmer grabbed his chest and waved his hand. It looked like he was feeling the hangover as he was done with bragging.He looked as deplorable as always, but no one was reproaching him. Rimmer was their hero for the day.\u201cThank you!\u201dThe trainees thanked him once again before returning.\u201cYou should stay here.\u201dAs Raon was about to follow them, Rimmer grabbed his shoulder with a green sheen to his face.\u201cYou don\u2019t look very well.\u201d\u201cAww, I overdid it a bit yesterday.\u201dNow that he looked at it, it wasn\u2019t just Rimmer. The other instructors\u2019 faces were also green. It seemed he drank a lot with them.\u201cGive it back.\u201dRimmer pointed at the elixir box Raon was holding.\u201cThis one is for you.\u201dHe took out another elixir box from his chest and opened the lid. The bitter scent was more intense than the Ten Cloud Elixir.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s made with two Ten Leaf Grasses. It would\u2019ve normally belonged to Raden, but it\u2019s a strange turn of fate that you end up getting it.\u201d\u201cIs it alright for me to have it?\u201d\u201cI got rich thanks to you, after all. I guess I finally discovered my talent in gambling.\u201dRimmer waved his hands once again and the expensive sound of rings and bracelets colliding with each other could be heard.\u2018They will be gone soon.\u2019Raon was certain that Rimmer would lose all his fortune from gambling soon enough.\u201cTen Cloud Elixir is a very efficient elixir. You should be able to absorb at least fifty percent of the mana it contains. However, the amount of mana it contains is rather small, and it won\u2019t make any difference to you. You have auras from two different attributes, after all.\u201dRimmer lowered his voice upon mentioning the two different attributes, so that no one could hear him.\u201cThat one has twice as much mana as the other Ten Cloud Elixirs, so you should be able to grow both your heat and frost.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dRaon bowed. Giving him the elixir was already plenty, yet he was even more thoughtful than that. He just couldn\u2019t thank him enough.\u201cYou should go. See you tomorrow.\u201dRimmer waved his hand.\u201cInstructor, please drink in moderation.\u201d\u201cOh, are you worried about me? It\u2019s ten years too early to be doing that!\u201dHe tapped his shoulder and went to the head instructor\u2019s room.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRaon fiddled with the box containing the Ten Cloud Elixir while looking at Rimmer\u2019s back.\u2018Is this what having a teacher feels like\u2026?\u2019An instructor had raised him in his previous life. His relationship with him was one of an animal keeper and a dog, or a tamer and a wolf.The instructor didn\u2019t have any emotions towards him, and Raon only grew enmity towards his instructor.\u2018I thought this place was no different.\u2019House Zieghart was infamous in the continent, so he thought the trainees would be raised like dogs. However, the children were being raised as human beings, keeping their individuality.Even those that had failed the exam before didn\u2019t get abandoned and were being trained in the sixth training ground. Zieghart really was full of humanity, despite his expectations.Rimmer in particular was more like a teacher rather than an instructor. It was thanks to him that he got all those achievements and grew up faster than he would\u2019ve otherwise.Raon bowed once again towards Rimmer, who was walking away, before leaving the training ground.***After taking a nap for three hours in the instructor\u2019s room, Rimmer visited the lord\u2019s manor at around noon.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dRoenn opened the door to the audience chamber with a broad smile.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while.\u201dRimmer grinned and raised his ten fingers. Roenn smiled slightly to express his disinterest and entered the audience chamber.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRimmer pouted, disappointed in Roenn for not recognizing those shiny jewels. He sighed softly and followed him inside.Glenn was the same as always. He was looking down on the world with a bored expression, sitting on the throne he had made himself.\u201cGreeting my lord!\u201dRimmer bowed, his ten fingers and even his wrist raised in the air.\u201cYou are getting even more pathetic as you get older.\u201d\u201cHah\u2026\u201dRimmer frowned at his ridiculous comment and stood up.\u201cNo, but you should compliment your subordinate if he won some money. It isn\u2019t every day that I can empty a doormat\u2019s purse.\u201d\u201cHow am I supposed to compliment you when that doormat is my son?\u201d\u201cHe needs to lose to me so he won\u2019t get tricked by a real swindler later.\u201d\u201cWhat a smooth talker.\u201dGlenn raised his chin with a frightening gaze.\u201cSo, what brought you here today?\u201d\u201cI distributed the Ten Cloud Elixirs to the children.\u201d\u201cI did expect you to do that, but you really did hand them over so easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like, because they grew up better than I thought they would, I wanted to feed them better things. I guess this is how parents feel about their children.\u201dRimmer giggled, and Glenn looked at him curiously.\u201cWell, it was basically because my teaching was exceptional, but the trainees became stronger than any other generation after going through various incidents.\u201dGlenn nodded slightly in agreement.\u201cThat\u2019s why I have a suggestion.\u201d\u201cA suggestion? I entrusted you with all the rights concerning training.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not about training.\u201dEven though Rimmer\u2019s voice used to be playful, it was now boiling with passion.\u201cPlease allow me to change the content of their graduation exam.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unclouded light radiated from his eyes for the first time since the fight against the Blood Raving Demon.\u201cIs the current graduation exam the instructor\u2019s recognition or a match between the trainees?\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201dThe trainees had to either pass the examination course the instructor made for them or have one-on-one matches between them to gain the instructor\u2019s acknowledgment in order to become a swordsman.\u201cThen what do you want it to be instead?\u201d\u201cSurvival.\u201dRimmer replied immediately.\u201cI want to send the trainees outside, without allowing them to use the Zieghart name.\u201cSend them outside?\u201dGlenn seemed interested as he leaned forward slightly.\u201cYes. The fifth training ground\u2019s children have passed the trial of pressure, and they\u2019ve achieved victory in the match of pride against the Owen kingdom\u2019s knight trainees. Neither of them was any different than a graduation exam.\u201d\u201cYou used various means to achieve that.\u201d\u201cIndeed. However, some incidents were beyond my expectations. During the second mission, the trainees went through a fight of life and death and managed to pass a great hurdle.\u201dRimmer smiled. It was by pure coincidence that he had arrived there late, but the children had managed to achieve great growth both physically and mentally thanks to that.\u201cI want this test to be an opportunity for the children to grow, rather than just a graduation ceremony. Even if it ends up slowing them down on their path to become swordsmen, I want to create a foundation for them to reach a higher level.\u201d\u201cYou are right. How they become swordsmen is more important than when.\u201dGlenn closed his eyes in agreement.\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand. With the way they are currently, the children need a new trial rather than an existing one.\u201dRimmer raised his long index finger.\u201cSurviving on their own without the house\u2019s power, the instructor\u2019s help, or the great Zieghart name will greatly help their growth.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve changed.\u201dThe corners of Glenn\u2019s mouth raised slightly, seeing Rimmer\u2019s confident gaze as he was knelt.\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cYou did say you would try raising the children, but you didn\u2019t look that interested in it before. You also did your preparations half-heartedly.\u201d\u201cUh, hmm\u2026\u201dRimmer quickly avoided his eyes as his faults were found out.\u201cYou started changing with the children after you met them. I don\u2019t think you realize how different your current expression is from before you met them.\u201d\u201cUh, I\u2019m embarrassed\u2026\u201d\u201cI also agree with him.\u201dRoenn nodded, a satisfied smile on his face.\u201cSir Rimmer, your expression has become really great.\u201d\u201cI realized sword wasn\u2019t my only talent, as I was also really great at raising children.\u201dRimmer scratched the side of his head, trying to hide his embarrassed expression.\u201cI\u2019m soon going to make the next king after my lord with my own end. Which means I\u2019ll be the king maker.\u201d\u201cAnd is that going to be Raon?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that. It could be Burren, or Martha or Runaan could rise to that position.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dGlenn smiled visibly, which was a rare sight to behold. He was pleased with Rimmer\u2019s newfound joy since he used to be the closest person to fight alongside him.\u201cMake a report on where you are going to send the children and how that will affect their growth. I\u2019ll give you one week, so if you can\u2019t do it, it will be canceled.\u201d\u201cBut of course.\u201dRimmer confidently smiled and took out a folder from his chest.\u201cI brought it already.\u201d***Raon climbed the North Grave Mountain instead of going to the annex building or the dormitory with the Ten Cloud Elixir. He was headed to the location the charcoal kiln used to be, the chilly colder now.\u2018I feel comfortable here.\u2019Probably because it was the place where he had acquired the\u00a0Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u00a0and the\u00a0Coldness of Frost, he felt comfortable cultivating there and he could feel\u00a0mana more easily.He sat down in front of the charcoal kiln\u2019s location, no trace of it remaining. He closed his eyes, listening to the refreshing sound of leaves and grass fluttering in the wind.He spread his aura perception to check his surroundings, and no human nor animal could be found. Vulcan had found a really great location.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon rotated the\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0to gather the energy from his body before opening his eyes. It was perfect weather and time to start cultivating.Tap.He opened the wooden box he received from Rimmer, a scent clear enough to numb his nose coming from it.\u2018Fifty percent, huh.\u2019Ten Cloud Elixir is called a fifty percent elixir.While around thirty percent of the energy could usually be absorbed from other elixirs, about fifty percent of Ten Cloud Elixir\u2019s energy could be absorbed instead.Thanks to its excellent absorption efficiency and the high purity of its energy, Ten Cloud Elixir was one of the best elixirs for a growing warrior.So what? Its contents are still as tiny as a speck.Wrath snorted, looking at the elixir.\u2018Well, the quantity is small indeed.\u2019It couldn\u2019t be great in every single aspect. Ten Cloud Elixir contained a small quantity of mana compared to the other elixirs.However, the one Rimmer gave him made up for its drawback by using two Ten Leaf Grasses.It had as much energy as an average medium level elixir, which would allow him to grow significantly after properly absorbing it.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dRaon took the elixir with his fingers. Feeling a warmth that contrasted with the cold wind blowing on the mountain, he put the Ten Cloud Elixir in his mouth.The elixir melted in his mouth as soon as it touched his tongue. He could feel a warm and pure energy around his navel, as if the mana of nature itself was inside his stomach.As the Ten Cloud Elixir\u2019s mana started boiling up, he used\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0to absorb its energy.Whir!* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The Ten Cloud Elixir\u2019s energy smoothly dashed through his mana circuit, as expected of an elixir that was unbiased against attributes.The energy soared like a tidal wave and the ice from his mana circuit melted down, expelling the murky energy remaining from his previous combat.\u2018It has a high density.\u2019The quantity of mana was still small, even with two Ten Leaf Grasses. However, the mana it contained was as pure as nature itself and was both warm and smooth at the same time.It was a perfect elixir for his unstable body, where the heat from the\u00a0Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation\u00a0and the\u00a0Coldness of the Frost\u00a0coexisted in his energy center.Leading the heat and frost, one after another, Raon accumulated the Ten Cloud Elixir\u2019s pure energy in his energy center.The quantity of gathered energy was small, like building a sandcastle, but the mana was denser and purer than any other elixir.Just like a lake of sages that was said to be made of dew, he felt the exhilaration of clear energy without a single spec of impurity running through his mana circuit as he became even more focused on the cultivation.Raon opened his eyes, hearing the thin chirping sound of birds announcing that it was night in the North Grave Mountain.Sparkle!His eyes shone like the kiln\u2019s flame.\u2018I got it all.\u2019Getting forty percent of the energy from an elixir was usually called a jackpot.However, Raon had just managed to accumulate sixty percent of the Ten Cloud Elixir's energy in his energy center. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say it was a miracle.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201dRaon closed his eyes to check the state of the\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0and the\u00a0Coldness of the Frost. When he opened his eyes again, messages appeared one after the other.[A new ring of fire has been cultivated.][Ring of Fire\u00a0has reached Five-Stars.][Body level has increased.][You can now move more efficiently.][Strength has increased greatly.][Agility has increased greatly.][Stamina has increased greatly.]The pleasant trembling of increased physical abilities could be felt from the edge of his hand to his shoulder.[Soul level has increased.][Willpower has increased greatly.][Perception has increased greatly.][Energy has increased greatly.]A second set of messages appeared before he could fully enjoy his happiness.A clear aura flowed through his widened energy center and mana circuit. It felt at least 1.5 times bigger than before thanks to the new ring that had formed.\u201cHaa!\u201dRaon exhaled excitedly and stood up. He clenched his fist and gathered the aura from the\u00a0Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation.\u2018Amazing.\u2019His body and aura were reacting a lot faster than before. He still probably couldn\u2019t defeat the Blood Raving Demon in his new state, but at least he wasn\u2019t going to lose one-sidedly like before.What\u2019s this?Wrath popped out from the bracelet despite having been silent while Raon was cultivating because he was afraid he would get his power stolen once again.Why did your soul level increase again? What technique do you even have? What on earth is the\u00a0Ring of Fire?\u201cI wonder?\u201dWhat kind of life did you have before the King of Essence arrived?Wrath shook his head.\u2018How could this happen\u2026\u2019Soul level only increased upon defeating a powerful opponent, overcoming a crisis, or achieving certain deeds.It was possible to increase it through training. However, it required many years, enough that can\u2019t be simply described as time anymore.Even in devildom, it had never been the case that a small child like him could increase his soul level through cultivation.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll tell you?\u201dRaon shook his hand, like he was chasing away a fly.Grit!Wrath bit his molar.\u2018It\u2019s going to be even more difficult to devour him\u2026\u2019Raon had been defending against his wrath and possession through his strong willpower, some unknown cultivation technique, and\u00a0Water Resistance.If his soul level increased, it would be as difficult to suppress him as before he accepted his wrath.Keuh, curb your arrogance! No matter how much effort you make, no matter what you obtain, your body and soul will belong to the King of Essence in the end!\u201cStop crying and just talk.\u201dI\u2019m not crying! The King of Essence is Devildom\u2019s\u2026\u201cOkay, you are the monarch of wrath. I get it, I get it.\u201dKeeeuh!Raon sneered and shook the dust off his clothes. As he was about to return to the annex building after tidying his outfit, he noticed the box on the ground.He picked up the elixir box from the ground and flipped his hair back.\u201cSeriously\u2026\u201dWhile someone was struggling to consume him, someone else was itching to help him.It was obvious who he should take after among the two and how he should act.Raon ignored Wrath, who was gritting his teeth, and climbed down the North Grave Mountain.***The next day, Burren went to the training ground with his heart filled with joy. He managed to absorb more than half of the Ten Cloud Elixir\u2019s energy the day before because his cultivation went really well.He felt like he had become a different person in a single day, his energy center completely full.\u2018As I am right now\u2026\u2019He probably still couldn\u2019t win against Raon, but he might be able to put up a good fight. The thought of it was making him smile.\u201cHmph, hmph.\u201dBurren straightened his spine and waited for Raon\u2019s arrival. He wanted to see his astonished eyes.Creak!He turned upon hearing the sound of the training ground\u2019s door opening. Martha was there instead of Raon, who he had been waiting for.\u2018She also managed to absorb a lot.\u2019The energy he could feel from her was as sturdy as a boulder, but sharp at the same time. It seemed she had also managed to absorb a significant amount of energy.\u201cWhy are you staring at me? You are making my morning unpleasant.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBurren turned his head since he didn\u2019t want to slam his pleasant mood into the mud.\u2018She has a bad personality, but her abilities are a real deal.\u2019The energy he could feel from Martha was different from the day before. It was less than his own, but she had also absorbed quite a lot of energy.Creak!The sound of the door opening could be heard once again. There were two sets of footsteps, but it felt like only one person was walking in. He was sure that it was Raon and Runaan.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201dBurren turned, his smile full of confidence. And then his expression shattered like a glass.\u2018Wh-what is that guy\u2026?\u2019The energy surrounding Raon was as natural as flowing water. Burren swallowed. Such slickness was only possible among the experts.The amount of aura and its balance with his body. Everything was different from the day before.If Burren\u2019s change could be digitized as a five, then Raon\u2019s change would\u2019ve been a ten.\u2018What a monster\u2026\u2019Burren grit his teeth. He wanted to make him admire his change, but he was astonished instead. It was so absurd that he became speechless.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dHe frowned and glared at Raon, but he just tilted his head, silently asking why he was looking at him. He had already acknowledged his efforts and talent, but his carefree face still made him angry.\u2018However, I\u2019m never going to give up.\u2019No matter how fast Raon progressed, no matter how strong he became, he had no intention of stopping chasing after him.Since a true swordsman of Zieghart, he imagined, would keep running until the end no matter how powerful his opponent was.\u201cAttention!\u201dRimmer\u2019s voice could be heard from the front. He didn\u2019t even notice his arrival because he was too focused on Raon.\u201cEveryone has changed.\u201dRimmer looked around the trainees from the platform and smiled. He looked satisfied with the trainees\u2019 growth.\u201cI think we can start it now with no problem.\u201d\u201cStart?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by start\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause these daily lives have to come to an end.\u201dHe pointed his finger at the training ground.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEnd?\u201d\u201cWh-what do you mean\u2026?\u201dThe trainees\u2019 trembled nervously upon hearing that it was going to end out of nowhere.\u201cYou have to take the graduation test. I know you love me so much, but you can\u2019t remain a trainee forever.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cAha!\u201d\u201cThe graduation exam!\u201dThe trainees\u2019 expressions brightened once again upon hearing it was about the exam. Their eyes turned as bright as a sunflower looking at the sun, looking forward to becoming real swordsmen.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to celebrate.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue and wagged his finger. He gave a nasty smile, looking at the trainees.\u201cAfter all, the exam you are going to take will be completely different from the graduation exams of the past.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius SwordsmanCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cA different exam?\u201dRaon tilted his head. Zieghart\u2019s trainee graduation exam was a simple one, consisting of either a match between the trainees or passing a course the instructors made for them.Judging from Rimmer\u2019s sly expression, the exam seemed to be rather extraordinary.\u201cYou guys have a lot more experience than the other trainees.\u201dRimmer clicked his tongue and wagged his finger.\u201cMatches of honor, battles of life and death, and a fighting method that uses your level. You went through experiences that you would normally face after becoming a regular swordsman,\u201dHe was right.Although it wasn\u2019t as much as Raon in his previous life, the fifth training ground trainees had experienced various things, more than House Robert or the other training grounds.It was pointless to give them an average test since they would easily pass.\u201cExams are an opportunity to accelerate your growth. Since an average test wouldn\u2019t help you in any way, I decided to change the content.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cCertainly.\u201dEveryone nodded after hearing Rimmer\u2019s explanation. It was a natural reaction since the trainees wanted to become more than just average swordsmen after watching Raon\u2019s fights and growing up with him.\u201cSo, what kind of exam are we going to take?\u201dBurren raised his hand and leaned forward.\u201cSurvival.\u201dRimmer\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He wasn\u2019t an old man living in the neighborhood anymore. Heavy and sharp pressure emanated from him.\u201cIt\u2019s survival. You are going to live outside, without using your position as Zieghart trainees. Your name and a single sword are the only thing you will be allowed to carry with you.\u201d\u201cS-survival\u2026\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d\u201cWe have to go outside with just our name and a sword?\u201dSince the trainees didn\u2019t expect survival at all as an exam, their jaws dropped at once.\u201cI understand your confusion, since it must be completely different from what you expected from a graduation exam. However, I\u2019m sure this trial is necessary for you.\u201dRimmer sat on the platform and looked down on the trainees.\u201cYou are currently overflowing with confidence. You\u2019ve defeated Owen Kingdom\u2019s knight trainees, survived a battle against Eden and took an elixir to grow both your aura and body. There were also smaller matters, like the battle against the sixth training ground. Well, it was mostly thanks to someone, though.\u201dHe cast a furtive glance at Raon.\u201cIn your current state, where you are brimming with confidence, you should see just how big and wide the world is with your own eyes.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dWhile the trainees were too confused to say anything, Raon was the only person to nod.\u2018He is right.\u2019Just as Rimmer said, a real experience was what the trainees needed the most since they had become stronger both physically and mentally.Experiencing a real battle by themselves, without using the house\u2019s name, would lead them to a higher level.\u201cHowever, you are allowed to refuse.\u201dRimmer smiled widely, raising his eyebrows.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy for you to live outside as you\u2019ve always been eating and living with what the house provided you with. Moreover, you could really die this time since there won\u2019t be any instructors following you this time, not even me.\u201dHe slowly nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll prepare a different graduation exam for those who are too scared. If you want to refuse, tell me tomorrow after thinking over it thoroughly.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cUh, a different exam?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need something like that.\u201dUnlike the other trainees, who were rolling their eyes as they pondered, Martha tapped her hair and shook her head. Her black eyes were shining as she stepped forward.\u201cSurvival? I\u2019ve been doing something like that ever since I started walking. Bring it on.\u201dMartha sneered, ready for any kind of exam.\u201cI\u2019m also fine with that.\u201dBurren\u2019s indifferent voice could be heard as he stepped up. His serious eyes held no sign of wavering.\u201cGraduation exam with survival as its theme, I agree that it\u2019s an opportunity for me to grow. I\u2019m going to accept it.\u201d\u201cSo, we have two people already.\u201dRimmer raised two fingers with a grin on his face.\u201cI-I\u2019ll do it as well!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cPlease, sign me up!\u201dEveryone started raising their hands, telling him they also wanted to join since Burren and Martha said they would.\u201cGood, good.\u201dRimmer clapped his hands and smiled each time the trainees said they would join.\u201cRunaan.\u201dRaon turned around to call Runaan, who was standing there blankly. She was tapping her feet at the same time Rimmer clapped his hand to get into the rhythm. It looked like she didn\u2019t really care about what was happening.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cWhat will you do, Raon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it too.\u201dShe went up and told Rimmer she would participate. As such, all forty-two trainees raised their hands, Raon being the only one left.\u201cRaon, how about you?\u201d\u201cOf course. I will go.\u201d\u201cHmm, is it okay for you to respond without thinking it through, despite being the top trainee? You don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going to send you.\u201dRimmer pouted, a mischievous expression on his face.\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dRaon smiled, not yielding to his provocation.\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be really difficult, but the instructor never gives us a trial that we can\u2019t overcome.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dRimmer\u2019s expression suddenly changed at Raon\u2019s confidently declared statement. He looked more embarrassed than happy.Rimmer had analyzed the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of every single trainee to teach them accordingly.Raon only found out about it recently, but most of Rimmer\u2019s actions were for the sake of the trainees.Despite his shallow behavior and tone, there was no reason to distrust him. His thoughts alone were thorough.\u201cI agree with him.\u201dBurren nodded, standing next to Raon.\u201cYou are lazy, bad at arriving on time, and fond of alcohol and gambling, but I can count on you when it comes down to education.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dMartha turned her head, but didn\u2019t say anything special, which meant that she agreed with Burren and Raon to a certain extent.\u201cIt\u2019s really touching that my students think of me like that.\u201dRimmer pretended to cry, making the sniffling sound with his mouth. He was pretending, trying to pass it off as a joke, but it was obvious he was happy about it as his mouth was curving up into a crescent shape.\u201cBut that\u2019s not a reason for me to go easy on you. You\u2019d better be thoroughly prepared.\u201dHe extended his hand behind him, and an instructor gave him the file.\u201cI was planning to tell you in a week, but since everyone agreed I\u2019ll just tell you where you will be going right now.\u201d\u201cAre we going to the same place?\u201dBurren raised his hand and asked.\u201cOf course not.\u201dRimmer wagged his finger.\u201cYou might say that I\u2019m wrong, but you tend to rely on one person too much.\u201dHis gaze was directed at Raon, and the trainees followed his gaze.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s right\u2026\u201dThe trainees licked their lips, agreeing with Rimmer to a certain extent.They were jealous of Raon and hated him at first, but they were now wholeheartedly following him after training, fighting, and overcoming a crisis together.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that you have a better relationship now, but it\u2019s not good to one-sidedly rely on him.\u201dWith a soft smile, Rimmer looked at the trainees one after the other.\u201cBecome swordsmen who can be relied upon by the others through this exam.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe trainees yelled their heads off, as they could feel the instructor\u2019s sincere intentions.\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201dRimmer opened the brochure he got from the instructor.\u201cBurren Zieghart.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou will go to the Levine desert in the west.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cMartha Zieghart, you will go to the Saian Canyon in the east, and\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for the trainees\u2019 response, Rimmer recited where they were headed one after another.\u201c\u2026Runaan Sullion, you will go to the Katam jungle in the northwest.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd finally, Raon Zieghart.\u201dRaon was the only one left after every trainee had been mentioned.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou will go to the Habun castle in the northeast.\u201d\u201cHabun castle\u2026\u201dRaon narrowed his eyes.\u2018He is sending me to such a wretched place.\u2019Habun castle was located further north than Zieghart, as one of the battlefields that fought against the monsters of the northern sea and Stallin mountain 365 days a year.\u2018I\u2019m sure it will be helpful.\u2019Even though he had the\u00a0Ring of Fire\u00a0and the\u00a0Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation, he still hadn't entirely regained his perception from his previous life.Living on such a battlefield would probably allow him to regain and surpass the murderous intent and perception he had in his previous life.\u201cThere\u2019s one month left until departure. Gather information about where you are headed, think and decide by yourselves what and how you are going to prepare. This is all part of the exam.\u201dRimmer raised his chin, closing the brochure.\u201cYes! Understood!\u201dThe trainees' eyes contained anticipation for their growth and anxiety for the unknown at the same time as they replied, loud and clear.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for everyone, but you are going to suffer a lot.\u201dRimmer stepped down in front of Raon, trying to scare him.\u201cThat place is called the battle hell because you don\u2019t even have time to unsheathe your sword.\u201d\u201cEeek!\u201dDorian was frightened, legs trembling, as he was supposed to go to Habun castle with him. Raon snickered at the sight.\u201cHell sounds good to me.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ll become stronger if I manage to survive that hell, and\u2026\u201dRaon nodded, with a confident smile.\u2018I\u2019ve already experienced the real hell.\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Kyangi][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cD-do you really have to do that?\u201dOnce Raon told the story about the graduation exam in the annex building, Helen trembled and shook her head.\u201cHabun castle is one of Zieghart\u2019s barriers, where powerful monsters endlessly pour in. He said he would prepare a different exam, so why do you need to go to such a place\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is for\u2026\u201d\u201cHe has to go.\u201dBefore Raon could talk, Sylvia put down her fork and knife and nodded.\u201cBut that\u2019s a really dangerous place\u2026\u201d\u201cHe still has to go.\u201dSylvia shook her head at Helen and looked at Raon.\u201cBecause it\u2019s an opportunity for Raon to grow.\u201dShe didn\u2019t see Raon as a little child anymore after his match against Raden. A swordsman, that\u2019s how she treated him now.But that didn\u2019t mean Sylvia\u2019s worries had disappeared. The hand holding her glass of water was trembling slightly.\u201cMom is right.\u201dRaon closed his eyes while Sylvia, Helen, and the maids looked at him with worried gazes.\u201cJust as the instructor said, this is an opportunity to grow, not just an exam. I have to grab this opportunity since it\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s a wise decision.\u201dIt seemed Helen and the maids still had a lot to say, but Sylvia was different since she used to live as a warrior. She had completely recognized his abilities.\u2018It\u2019s convenient.\u2019Helen had a great voice in the matter as the head maid, but she couldn\u2019t beat Sylvia. Since he had Sylvia\u2019s agreement, it would be easier to train in the future.\u201cI\u2019m going to train, then.\u201dRaon put aside his empty dish and stood up.\u201cRaon.\u201dAs he was about to return to his room, Sylvia turned her head.\u201cPrepare yourself thoroughly, be ready for any situation.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dRaon nodded confidently and left the room.\u201cMy lady, are you really okay?\u201d\u201cHaa, there\u2019s no way I would be .\u201dSylvia\u2019s hand that was holding the glass of water visibly trembled. There was no way she would feel at ease when her only son was going to a dangerous place.\u2018However\u2026\u2019Unlike Helen, she was aware of what kind of people warriors were, and what kind of things swordsmen craved. That was why she had to allow Raon to go there, no matter how much she hated it.Even if she objected to it, Raon would go there anyway. It was better for his sake to just straight up allow him.\u201cBut I\u2019m still worried. It\u2019s such a dangerous place\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s normal to be worried.\u201dSylvia nodded her head.\u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s something we need to do.\u201d\u201cWe need to do something?\u201d\u201cYes. We have to maintain our current state to the best of our abilities, so that Raon can rest assured once he returns.\u201dShe looked around the maids and smiled widely. She was hiding away her anxiety as a mother and the annex building\u2019s master.\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201dThe maids quietly nodded, agreeing with her.Judiel silently clenched her fist, looking at Sylvia and Helen.***Even though he was about to head over to a battlefield in a month, Raon\u2019s daily routine remained the same as always.He did his daybreak training like always, then went to the fifth training ground to have Rimmer and the instructors teach him, and he was the last one to leave in the evening to keep training.However, the intensity was on a different level from before.Burren and Martha got sick of him just from watching him, and Runaan was too tired to keep up with him.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe training was so difficult that it was eating up his immense willpower. Raon kept doing it every day for a week, before returning to the annex building.Since it was time for everyone to be asleep, he entered his room through the window.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt was so tidy that not a single speck of dust could be seen, and a gentle fragrance could be smelled from the clothes and bedding.\u2018They didn\u2019t need to do all this.\u2019Despite his thoughts, he was smiling on the outside.He was grateful to Sylvia and the maids, who worked hard to let him rest comfortably whenever he returned.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRaon exhaled and sat at the bed. He felt sleepy since the recent training had been difficult, even for him.As he was about to lie down on the bed, he could feel something on it.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dHe tilted his head and lifted the corner of the blanket, spotting a small book.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dRaon\u2019s eyes widened upon reading the book. The book contained information about Habun castle, which was where he was headed.Its geographic information, information about the monsters that appeared there, and even information about important personnel. It was obvious who left the book there.\u2018Judiel.\u2019She had prepared that information after learning that he was headed to Habun castle.Raon licked his lips, feeling bitterness on the tip of his tongue.\u201cI need to clear this up before heading out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
