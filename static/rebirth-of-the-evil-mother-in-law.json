The woman in the mirror has light-colored skin. Her features weren\u2019t as pretty as they were when she was young, but it has the attraction of an older woman. Her lips were curved slightly upward, and her temperament was elegant. The clothes on her might look simple, but all the designer\u2019s uniqueness was hidden in all the details.Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t help but feel perplexed. Her hand touched her face reflexively, and the woman in the mirror did the same thing. When was the last time she looked at herself that way?She was dressed elegantly and exhibiting a tenderness of her own. She didn\u2019t appear unkempt, disheveled, and looked down by all.As one of the wealthiest men in the country and having a net worth of over tens of billions, her husband has an extremely prestigious status. Not to mention their outstanding and eminent son and their lively and loving daughter. Fang JunRong was what people referred to as the winner of life; unfortunately, her life took a turn for the worse ever since the appearance of Jiang YaGe, her daughter-in-law.Jiang YaGe was the daughter of her husband\u2019s best friend from college. After her parents died in a car accident, her husband Li WangJin felt bad for her and took her in after considering the fact that her relatives were all plotting against her. Fang JunRong was quite nice to Jiang YaGe at the beginning as well, after all, Fang JunRong was also friends with Jiang YaGe\u2019s father. Plus, Jiang YaGe was a pleasant and mature girl. This changed after the conflicts began between Jiang YaGe and Li XinYun, Fang JunRong\u2019s daughter.Let it be her husband, Li WangJin, or her son Li ShiZe, everybody sided with Jiang YaGe. They would always pick Jiang YaGe\u2019s side and blame Fang JunRong\u2019s XinYun whenever there was a conflict between the two. So how could Fang JunRong continue to be fond of Jiang YaGe given the situation? In the end, her son Li ShiZe further fell in love with Jiang YaGe and butted heads with his mother repeatedly while treating his cold sister coldly.Jiang YaGe, on the other hand, was a drama queen. It was almost like she was blessed by some unseen power \u2013 no matter what happened, she would always be able to avoid anything bad happening to her, and it was always those who were around her who\u2019d end up taking the brunt of it. XinYun, her precious daughter, was one of those people. Because of Jiang YaGe, Li XinYun ended up scarred on her face and became more and more reclusive.By then, Fang JunRong hated Jiang YaGe\u2019s guts and wanted to kick her out. Nevertheless, both her husband and her son unequivocally took Jiang YaGe\u2019s side and criticized and loathed Fang JunRong.\u201cYaGe had suffered a lot too. How could you keep placing the blame on her? It wasn\u2019t like she wanted it to happen. You are being so irrational right now. You are no longer that reasonable and loving wife that I have married.\u201d\u201cIf my sister didn\u2019t go out and befriended all these questionable people, this would have never happened. Once all this is settled, we will just send her overseas to have a plastic surgery and all will be fine again.\u201dTheir callous and estranged looks were burned into her memory, giving her a frigid feeling. Her family was wrecked. Fang JunRong wanted to take revenge, but Jiang YaGe was loved and protected by many bosses. Their interference foiled all of her plans, and she was finally sent to the mental institution by her own husband and son.When she was locked up in the mental institution, everybody called her crazy. That she couldn\u2019t appreciate such an amazing daughter-in-law and wanted to hurt her any chance that she got. They thought it was her own fault that all her loved ones had betrayed her. Finally, when she heard that news that her daughter Li XinYun had committed suicide, Fang JunRong took her last breath surrounded by dark iciness. At the same time, Li ShiZe, her wonderful son, was having a great time with her amazing daughter-in-law on their honeymoon.Thinking of that, Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t help but let deep hatred crawl into her eyes. Her teeth bit down so hard that her lips almost started to bleed. Finally, the pain helped her clear her mind. She let out a deep breath and did her best to calm the conflicting emotions within herself.She had no idea why she went back to eight years ago after she closed her eyes. This was before Jiang YaGe had joined the Li\u2019s, and her family was still the model family in everybody\u2019s eyes.She looked down reflexively at her wrist and saw a jade bracelet on her pale wrist. The bracelet was uniform throughout and almost translucent in color. It was dazzling under the light. There was a darker shade of green on it that looked like the silhouette of mountains. This bracelet was given to her when her grandmother passed away. Worried that she might inadvertently nick or chip it, she had always kept it stored safely inside the safe and had never worn it. In her previous life, the bracelet has gone missing. She was enraged at the time and looked all over for it. Finally, her son was the one who told her that it was stolen by a maid.The bracelet should be lying quietly inside the safe right now. This was a peculiar discrepancy from her previous life.Or was her previous life nothing but a nightmare?No, that couldn\u2019t be. No nightmare would have so many details and be so heartbreaking. Just recalling the past events was enough to make her body shiver from hatred.\u201cMom, where is my favorite dress? The one that Aunty designed for me? Which closet is it in?\u201d came a crisp and lively voice.Fang JunRong, who was immersed in her own pain looked up abruptly. She saw a girl with slightly curly hair and still a little bit of childishness in her look. The tip of her hair was dyed a red color and made her look cute and playful. This was her precious daughter Li XinYun.She looked at her daughter\u2019s simple and cute look rapaciously, as though she was in a dream. When was the last time she saw her daughter so lively? Ever since she was defaced, her daughter had locked herself up and never left her room, as though she had lost all will to live.\u201cMom.\u201d\u201cMom!\u201dA series of cries brought her back. Fang JunRong blinked and got rid of the moisture in her eyes.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You dyed your hair?\u201dFeeling a little guilty, Li XinYun touched the tip of her hair before she defended herself, \u201cI have already graduated high school. You said before that I can dye my hair after the university entrance examination. Mom, where\u2019s that dress that was given to me by Aunty? I can\u2019t remember where I put it. I want to wear it on my birthday.\u201dHer daughter XinYun was the only thing that kept her going when she was in the mental institution. She had reminisce over every memory of her daughter and every little bit of it seemed like it had just happened yesterday.\u201cIt\u2019s over on my side. You didn\u2019t want to misplace it so you put it over on my side specifically.\u201d\u201cOh yeah! I had forgotten all about it!\u201d said Li XinYun as she stuck her tongue out briefly, feeling silly. Then, wrapping her arm around her mother\u2019s, she said to her mother affectionately, \u201cMom\u2019s the best. Oh, right, mom. Do you think I can invite my classmates to my birthday?\u201dFang JunRong had never been able to resist puppy eyes from her daughter. Now that she had gone back eight years and knew what was installed for her daughter, how could she let any sadness touch that smile of hers?\u201cOf course you can. You can invite as many people as you want.\u201d\u201cHeh, I knew mom loved me the most.\u201d Li XinYun went on jabbering about herself. Fang JunRong looked at her smile and couldn\u2019t help but recall another detail. Jiang YaGe\u2019s parents passed away on the same day as XinYun\u2019s birthday. In her previous life, XinYun looked forward to her birthday so much and coordinated everything herself yet her husband Li WangJin used \u201cit would upset YaGe\u201d as an excuse and cancelled it. Even her son stood on his side. XinYun was his real daughter, but he\u2019d put Jiang YaGe ahead of her on everything.This was the beginning of XinYun\u2019s displeasure with Jiang YaGe, and everything else snowballed from here on out.XinYun might have a little bit of a temper, but she was not a petty person. If the other two didn\u2019t place Jiang YaGe before her on just about anything, she never would have hated Jiang YaGe so much.This time around, she wouldn\u2019t let her daughter feel a shred of grievance. Her man? She didn\u2019t want him anymore. Her son? She\u2019d just pretend that she had given birth just to a placenta. She owed them nothing. Any last bit of love she had for her son was gone during her time at the mental institution. The timing of her rebirth wasn\u2019t the best. She still had a lot of faith in her husband then, and he had control of the company. If she was to divorce him now, she wouldn\u2019t be able to come out ahead.She has time. She could take her time and plan it all out. She would take back everything that was hers!Listening to her daughter\u2019s coquettish voice, the darkness around her started to dissipate.\u201cXinYun, why are you still gluing to your mother all day long like an immature child?\u201dThe smile on Fang JunRong\u2019s lips disappeared after hearing her husband\u2019s voice. The man whom she was supposed to spend the rest of her life was one of those who hurt her the most.\u201cXinYun will always be a child in my mind no matter how old she is. I like her around me,\u201d said Fang JunRong mildly while exercising her best self-control to not jump up and scratch the hell out of that face.Appearance-wise, Li WangJin, who was already in his 40s, was well maintained and looked to be in his thirties. That plus his incredible net worth caused him to have many admirers over the years, but he had turned them all down and earned the reputation of being a good husband in the eyes of the public. Fang JunRong had once been very proud of that. But she never expected that great husband of hers would one day be able to watch his own daughter suffer and watch his wife taken to the mental institution and suffer the way she did there.When the public thought that it was Jiang YaGe who was not familial, it was Li WangJin who stood up and stamped the approval that Fang JunRong had bad temperament and was the source of all the problems. He blamed his wife for mistreating Jiang YaGe. In his eyes, everything was Fang JunRong\u2019s fault.Thinking of that, the burning hatred inside of her hit her like a tidal wave and almost drowned her. Up until the end of her life, she never figured out why he treated Jiang YaGe better than his own daughter and why was he able to be so ruthless to her and her daughter.Li WangJin put on a resigned look as though he was going along with them. \u201cThe two of you are always on the same side. I can never win.\u201dLi XinYun said gloatingly, \u201cMom loves me the most.\u201d\u201cThen can XinYun let me borrow your mother for a few minutes? There\u2019s something I wanted to talk to her about,\u201d said Li WangJin.Li XinYun wasn\u2019t an immature person. As though she had misunderstood something, she winked at Fang JunRong and let go of her. She bounced away and her voice came from afar, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t eavesdrop on the adults\u2019 secrets!\u201dFang JunRong, on the other hand, had a pretty good idea what Li WangJin wanted to talk to her about. It was probably about how he wanted to bring over Jiang YaGe; it was about that time.After their daughter was gone, Li WangJin let out a sigh and a disturbed look. \u201cJunRong, do you remember the kid Jiang YaGe?\u201dHow could she not?Fang JunRong snickered to herself but said calmly, \u201cThe one who\u2019s lost her parents to a car accident, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that one,\u201d said Li WangJin as a hint of pain flashed through his eyes. \u201cOriginally, I figured that even though she had lost her parents, they have left her with plenty of money so she would still be alright. Who\u2019d have thought that her relatives could be so ruthless that they had taken away her money and her house with the help of her grandmother?\u201cNot only did they leave her nothing for her college tuition, they even wanted to marry her off to some old man back in the village. Her father was my roommate back in college. I can\u2019t just stand around and let this happen to her, so I would like to bring her over.\u201dThose were the exact same words from her previous life.That was truly not a dream.Fang JunRong\u2019s nails were about to dig into her own palm. Back then, she had been friends with Jiang YaGe\u2019s father and also felt bad learning about what had happened to her and agreed to Li WangJin\u2019s suggestion right away. But this time around\u2026\u201cWhat do you think, JunRong?\u201dPerhaps, she had remained silent for too long, so there was a rare sense of anxiousness in Li WangJin\u2019s voice.Fang JunRong looked up and put on the perfect look. She frowned slightly as those she felt for her and said, \u201cWhat had happened to her was very awful.\u201dShe paused for a little and carried on, \u201cBut if she is to stay here without an official title, she\u2019d have to withstand a lot of gossip for living in someone else\u2019s house.\u201dHer words had, indeed, gave Li WangJin some hesitation.Fang JunRong continued to say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we make it official and adopt her? That way she won\u2019t be looked down upon.\u201dLi WangJin was ecstatic, \u201cJunRong, you are indeed the most caring and reasonable person in the world.\u201dFang JunRong did not fail to notice the irony in this whole situation. Anyone who didn\u2019t know better would think that Jiang YaGe was his real daughter. He had never been that nice to XinJun before. But since he looked at Jiang YaGe as his own daughter, it was her duty to make sure that was the case. They\u2019d be long divorce by then, and Jiang YaGe wouldn\u2019t get any of her inheritance anyway.What Fang JunRong really wanted to find out was, with the added sibling title between them, would her wonderful son still fall madly in love with Jiang YaGe?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had given up on Li WangJin a long time ago, but she could never get over the behaviors of her son. Before Jiang YaGe came to their house, Li ShiZe had always been impeccable when it came to his parents and his sister. He remembered everyone\u2019s birthday and cared a lot about his sister. He had always been her pride and joy.But ever since he had run into Jiang YaGe, he seemed to have given up all of his other roles. He was Jiang YaGe\u2019s Li ShiZe, and she was the only thing left in his life. He was no longer her son; no longer the brother of Li XinYun. Anyone who dared to stand in front of Jiang YaGe would be his enemy.She couldn\u2019t help but see his cold look in her head, like a frigid winter in December, making her shudder in its coldness.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt YaGe in front of me in any way, not even you.\u201cFrom this day forward, we are no longer mother and son.\u201d***Every time she recalled that day, she felt as though her heart was being cut into pieces. As painful as it was, she had gotten used to it after a while.Fang JunRong took a deep breath and suppressed all of her emotions. In front of her, Li WangJin was still jabbering on and on in front of her about how nice Jiang YaGe was, trying to increase Fang JunRong\u2019s fondness for her.\u201cYaGe would be delighted when she found out about this. Have you met before? She really isa very kind and very mature girl. You\u2019ll like her once you\u2019ve met her.I hope that XinJun will take a page from YaGe\u2019s book after YaGe has joined us. XinJun is a little spoiled. I\u2019ve heard that she has turned to you for an allowance again?\u201dFang JunRong pursed her lips a little and said, \u201cWe have plenty of money. Our little princess shouldn\u2019t have to suffer. If we are talking about spending money, one of those paintings you bought cost more than her entire allowance for the year, no?\u201dIn her previous life, Li WangJin had always compared the two girls with each other, specifically praising Jiang YaGe and talking down on XinJun. As much as XinJun wasn\u2019t a petty girl, after being talked down time and again, it was inevitable that she started feeling resentful toward Jiang YaGe.Li WangJin was a man with double standards. While he felt that XinJun spent too much money, he also spent a lot on birthday parties for Jiang YaGe and bought her all sorts of gifts. Perhaps, in his mind, it was worth it to spend as much as he wanted to on Jiang YaGe, but it was simply wasteful when he spent it on his own daughter. Fang JunRong had no idea what kind of curse Jiang YaGe had casted on him.Even though Fang JunRong had no more feelings for him, thinking of that still brought back anger in her. Her tone turned cold.\u201cRaising a daughter cost money. If we can\u2019t even afford one girl, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be talking about adopting a second one. We don\u2019t want to not be able to treat her nice after she comes over. Or you can reduce the number of times you go to auctions.\u201dLi WangJin changed colors and said, as though appeasing her, \u201cI am just kidding. Don\u2019t take that so seriously. XinJun is our child. Of course I want to spoil her too.\u201dAs though he was worried that she didn\u2019t believe him, he immediately transferred another $1 M allowance to XinJun.Fang JunRong no longer wanted to waste time on talking to him and quickly sent him away. Right now, the most important thing was to figure out the situation with their money, so she knew what she was getting into when they got their divorce. With the exception of their house and land, the most valuable assets of The Fang\u2019s was Ayron Corporation, Li WangJin\u2019s electrical company, and Meifang, a newly founded company for skin care products.Later on, her bbq pork son even gave away their skin care product company to Jiang YaGe. Words had it that Jiang YaGe had some formulas for skin care products, and she was able to make a ton of money with them. From there, she was able to befriend quite a few bosses to back her.The timing of her rebirth wasn\u2019t the worst. She still has her people in finance, human resources, and research &amp; development. Among all of them, Xu WeiWei, the manager of finance, was a good friend of hers from her college days.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn her previous life, she had slowly handed over her business to her son. By the time she realized it, her bbq son had already swapped out all of her trusted ones. She had lost all of her capital to fight with them and lost everything that she had.She gave her good friend Xu WeiWei a call and set a time to meet up with her on Saturday afternoon. Fang JunRong booked a private room at \u201cWhite Crane\u201d, a club that she frequented.Before their meeting, she had looked over all of their properties \u2013 they had a total of 16 shops, all of them at fairly decent locations. Just these shops already added up to over a billion. Mansions and other houses under her name probably added up to another $4 billion. All the houses that they had purchased were put under Fang JunRong\u2019s name. That was part of the reason for Li WangJin\u2019s reputation of being a great man, and many took his side during their divorce.She let out a long sigh. Luckily, she hasn\u2019t given away all these houses yet. In her previous life, she had divided up their houses into two sets and gave them to her son and daughter on her daughter\u2019s debutante. Later on, Li WangJin had convinced XinJun to also give him her share in the name of investment.Thinking of that, Fang JunRong\u2019s hatred for Li WangJin deepened.During this lifetime, she would not give away her houses and her shops no matter what.She had recollected her emotions and watched coldly when Li WangJin busied himself in getting the room ready for Jiang YaGe. He wanted to arrange Jiang YaGe\u2019s room on the second floor next to Li ShiZe\u2019s, but Fang JunRong interrupted and assigned her a different room on the first floor instead.When Saturday came, she drove to White Crane, a very famous club in City S, after lunch. Her good friend Xu WeiWei had arrived, after she had waited for about ten minutes or so and. Xu WeiWei even brought her laptop. Wearing her hair short, she looked like a very competent business woman.As soon as she sat down, Xu WeiWei immediately turned on her computer and pulled out an USB drive. \u201cEven if you hadn\u2019t contacted me, there\u2019s something that I wanted to talk to you about.\u201dShe was a very meticulous person, and she stored the important information separately on an USB drive.In her past life, Fang JunRong missed Xu WeiWei the most after her daughter. Xu WeiWei and her had been friends for over 20 years. Because of her, Li WangJin even dragged Xu WeiWei into their matters, and she ended up in jail for a crime that she never committed. Fang JunRong had always felt guilty over that.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dShe felt perplexed. She didn\u2019t remember this bit in her previous life.Xu WeiWei opened up a file, hesitated a little, and finally went ahead, \u201cOver the last few years, CEO Li had spent a lot of the company\u2019s money in buying antiques and paintings. The amount was pretty sizable.\u201dFang JunRong seemed to recall vaguely that Xu WeiWei had mentioned this to her in her previous life. She didn\u2019t think it was important at the time and got into a little bit of a riff with Xu WeiWei. No wonder she had stopped bringing it up afterward.Li WangJin seemed to have fallen for antiques and paintings since ten years ago, and he even started a company that took care of matters related to those for him. He was especially fond of the paintings by a Xu FangWeng, and he had spent a lot of money on his work. The odd thing was that as much as Li WangJin had collected, he had never had a show but just kept all of the paintings inside his mansion.Fang JunRong looked more solemn now. \u201cHow much has he spent so far?\u201d\u201cI have done some preliminary calculations. He had spent close to $3.6B in this area over the last ten years,\u201d replied Xu WeiWei.Even though Fang JunRong had prepared herself, she still changed colors. That was definitely an amount higher than she had expected.The Li\u2019s might be rich, but $3.6B was not a small amount. And he had the audacity to criticize his daughter for overspending?\u201cI know it\u2019s not my place to say this, but I think I should let you know something else\u2026\u201d said Xu WeiWei in a low voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXu WeiWei had just noticed this abnormality when she was combing through the finance this year. She hesitated for a little bit and decided that she should share this with her good friend.Fang JunRong looked through the file prepared by Xu WeiWei carefully and finally her sight locked onto one line.\u201cRed-Crowned Crane\u201d, $150 million.This was purchased by Li WangJin three years ago.The \u201cRed-Crowned Crane\u201d was arguably the famed artist Xu FangWeng\u2019s most well-known work. Fang JunRong had seen the actual item before, at her uncle\u2019s manager Old Mr. Zhang\u2019s place. She was quite certain that under no circumstances would Old Mr. Zhang resell this piece of artwork. Li WangJin was with her at the time and had also seen it.What this meant was that the painting that he purchased was doubtless a counterfeit. He spent $150 million on a counterfeit painting? That\u2019d make him a water-brain idiot. Is Li WangJin an idiot? Didn\u2019t look like it.Then there\u2019s only one explanation left. Li WangJin had been using this as an excuse to shift all the money from the company into his personal account all these years. In her previous life, Li WangJin gave his art collection to their daughter Li XinYun during their divorce. Fang JunRong, at the time, thought that he still cared about his daughter after all. As it turned out, he was just giving her a stack of garbage.Thinking of that, her stomach content started to roil and the feeling of disgust bubbled up nonstop.Even though she was quite certain about her speculation, she still needed more evidence. Fang JunRong called up Uncle Zhang, the rightful owner of \u201cRed-Crowned Crane\u201d. He was also a loyal fan of Xu FengWeng and knew quite a bit about the artist and the whereabouts of some of his other works.She inquired about a few of other Xu FengWeng\u2019s other works and found out for sure that a few of the paintings on the list were in the hands of some of Uncle Zhang\u2019s friends.After she hung up the phone, Fang JunRong laughed. A sarcastic laugh. Nobody knew if she was laughing at Li WangJin or herself, perhaps a little bit of both. She had always thought that their issues began after Jiang YaGe had joined them; she hadn\u2019t expected that he had started plotting against their assets since ten years ago, in a quiet and seemingly harmless way.So they have never truly been a family from the very beginning. He had started this ten years ago, what a patient man that he was.Xu WeiWei was a smart person. She had a good idea what was going on from Fang JunRong\u2019s phone call. Anger was obvious on her face, but she tried to control herself in front of Fang JunRong. \u201cWhat do you want to do? You want to divorce him?\u201dShe knew her good friend well. Now that Fang JunRong had found out that the man sleeping next to her every night had been plotting, she for sure would not let this go easily.\u201cHe must have an accomplice who helped him with all these counterfeits in order to have acquired all these seamlessly over the years,\u201d said Fang JunRong. And, knowing how careful a person Li WangJin was, he wouldn\u2019t have a lot of accomplices either. After all, the more people knew about it, the higher the chance that it would be leaked.She paused for a second and her squinted eyes seemed cold. \u201cLet\u2019s find that person first and have him paint a few more.\u201d\u201cSo he likes counterfeits, right? We will let him buy to his heart\u2019s content then.\u201dWhen the two of them get divorced, these counterfeits would go to him. After all, she\u2019s a nice person. A nice person doesn\u2019t take away the things that someone else loves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xu WeiWei was the one she could trust the most. For the sake of not alerting Li WangJin, she shouldn\u2019t be too involved herself, so she\u2019d have to rely mainly on Xu WeiWei.Walking out of the private room, Fang JunRong heard a somewhat familiar voice.\u201cLet me go. I am going to call the cops if you don\u2019t stop what you are doing.\u201dIt was the voice that had haunted her for many nights. It sounded stubborn with a hint of pitifulness. It was the voice of Jiang YaGe. Every time she talked with that voice, all the knights around her would slay everything in her way and ensure her safety.She turned around and saw Jiang YaGe in her server\u2019s uniform. It perfectly accentuated her curves, making her seem slender and elegant, like a bud ready to bloom. Her skin was light colored. She may just be comely looking, but her innocent quality made her stand out. That plus her slightly defiant aura was the reason she was able to attract all the SGR (second generation rich)\u2019s attention. To many of the SGRs, conquering a girl like her was a real challenge.Listening to her words that sounded stronger than they were, the man in front of her smiled and said in a dallying tone, \u201cSure. Call the cops, why don\u2019t you? So cute that you are still trying to feign innocence at a place like this.\u201dHe gripped Jiang YaGe\u2019s wrist tightly and looked all up and down her curvy body in a vulgar way.If it was someone else, Fang JunRong would most likely step in and help out, but this was Jiang YaGe in front of her. Remembering everything that had happened to her in the previous life, she couldn\u2019t muster up that kind of kindness. Besides, Jiang YaGe had always been eerily lucky.Somehow she was always able to dodge any bad luck that went her way. So most likely, the same thing would happen this time as well. Fang JunRong did not know that Jiang YaGe had worked at this club before joining the Li\u2019s. Li WangJin most likely has not yet mentioned to her about wanting to adopt her yet; otherwise she would have quit this job already.Fang JunRong was an acquaintance of the owner of the club. So she had a pretty good idea that every worker here was selected carefully and all had exquisite beauty. At tens of thousands a month, their income wasn\u2019t bad either. But, even though nothing too bad could happen here, there would inevitably be some brutes who would cross the line from time to time.The rich young man\u2019s words might sound awful, but there was some truth in them. Anyone who worked there should expect that something like this could happen from time to time. With Jiang YaGe\u2019s qualifications, she would be a tutor if she wanted to. She wouldn\u2019t make as much, but it\u2019d be much safer. What was going through her mind?Jiang YaGe lifted her head slightly, looking restrained and stubborn, \u201cI\u2019d rather lose this job than to be insulted by you!\u201dHaving said that, she flung off his hand.The rich young man felt offended by being face slapped by the server.\u201cHow dare you! I am telling you, you will be serving me today.\u201dSuddenly, a girl with a pointy face dashed out. Compared to Jiang YaGe\u2019s innocent look, this girl was more delicate, and her eyes were magnetic. Her uniform very much accentuated her proud bosoms, about to bounce out any minute. \u201cYoung Master Gu, YaGe can\u2019t drink very much, she won\u2019t be able to please you. Why don\u2019t I drink with you instead?\u201dFang JunRong recognized this girl. She was Zhong Yi, one of Jiang YaGe\u2019s close girlfriends in her previous life from the very beginning. Later on, she heard that the two of them had a falling out over a man, and Zhong Yi had turned against Jiang YaGe. Fang JunRong had heard someone mention that Zhong Yi was manipulative and only used Jiang YaGe as a springboard to secure herself a rich man.Fang JunRong had no idea what happened to Zhong Yi afterwards, but everyone who crossed Jiang YaGe ended poorly, so presumably, Zhong Yi would meet the same fate as well.This encounter, however, gave Fang JunRong a different impression of her. Willing to risk offending someone else and jumping out to help out Jiang YaGe like that, Zhong Yi seemed more like a loyal friend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as the wealthy young master would take her offer, the whole issue would end right here. Unfortunately, Jiang YaGe was not one who\u2019d take the ordinary path. She looked at Zhong Yi and said unhappily, \u201cXiao Yi, let\u2019s ignore someone like that! What if he gropes you when you are drinking with him?\u201cPush comes to shove, we\u2019d just quit this job!\u201dShe might have sounded very righteous, but her good friend Zhong Yi looked disturbed and said to her, \u201cYaGe\u2026\u201dEven Fang JunRong, watching the whole event from one side, felt speechless from Jiang YaGe\u2019s response. She changed her mind and started walking towards them.\u201cCan the two of you help me tidy up my private room?\u201d She said to both Jiang YaGe and Zhong Yi. She wondered what kind of reaction Jiang YaGe would have when they meet again at the Li\u2019s a little while later.Clearly, Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t entirely stupid. She quickly responded, \u201cSure, which private room are you in?\u201dZhong Yi, too, looked more relaxed than she was before.The wealthy young master apparently recognized Fang JunRong and said in a friendly voice, \u201cEh? Is that you, Boss Fang? If you want them to assist you, then I won\u2019t fight you over them.\u201dHe even gave a \u201cplease go ahead\u201d gesture.Fang JunRong smiled slightly and went back into her private room with both Jiang YaGe and Zhong Yi following behind them.After they had closed the door behind them, Fang JunRong asked casually, \u201cHow did you two end up working here?\u201dShe noticed that her self-control had been getting better and better. She was now able to suppress her hatred and desire for revenge. Or, perhaps, Jiang YaGe was only one of the many culprits, and Fang JunRong hated Li WangJin and Li ShiZe even more.\u201cI am doing this for my tuition next semester. My uncle and his people took away the insurance money from my parents,\u201d said Jiang YaGe. When she said that, moisture appeared in her eyes, making her look all the more pitiful.Xu WeiWei, Fang JunRong\u2019s good friend, raised her brows and said very bluntly, \u201cAs far as I know, many universities nowadays offer financial assistance. If you work hard enough, you should be able to earn enough to cover other expenses just by being a tutor for two summer months.\u201dFang JunRong gave her good friend a look of approval \u2013 she was her good friend after all; she was thinking the exact same thing.Jiang YaGe acted as though this was the first time that she realized that option and said, stuttering, \u201cOh, yeah\u2026 I guess there\u2019s that.\u201dZhong Yi bit her lower lips and said, \u201cMy grandmother is ill, and we need money for hospital visits and medications. I won\u2019t be able to make enough to cover her medications being a tutor.\u201dShe may have that bewitching and sycophantic look that most disliked, but she certainly has an unyielding personality.Fang JunRong pursed her lips a little and said, \u201cThat\u2019s very responsible of you and that reminds me of my own grandmother. I have a very nice grandmother too. Sadly, she passed away before I was able to take care of her.\u201dShe sighed, looked at Zhong Yi amiably, and said, \u201cI like you a lot. How\u2019d you like to be my adopted daughter?\u201dIf the Li\u2019s were going to adopt Jiang YaGe, what\u2019s another Zhong Yi? It isn\u2019t like she\u2019d encroach on her inheritance. Since Li WangJin enjoyed adopting daughters so much, helping him adopt a few more would be the right thing to do!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And so, when the two of them had a falling out, public opinion sided with Jiang YaGe and criticized Zhong Yi as the white-eyed wolf, and the topic of \u201cthe entire world owes me a girlfriend like Jiang YaGe\u201d was further pushed into the top trending list.So what would happen if both of them could stand side by side as peers this time around? And, whose side would her bbq-pork son* be on when he suddenly gained two sisters, both with a woeful past?* (T/N: An unofficial Chinese saying. Usually when a mother is mad at the son she\u2019d say to him, \u201cI should have given birth to a slab of bbq pork instead of you.\u201d)Zhong Yi felt like she had just won the lottery, and she couldn\u2019t even focus her eyes. It was after a long while before she was able to say with a stutter, \u201cDo you mean it?\u201dFang JunRong smiled and said, \u201cOf course. Here\u2019s my business card. If you like the idea, come and talk to me next weekend. That ought to give you a week\u2019s time to think it over.\u201dShe fished out one of her business cards and handed it over to Zhong Yi. She skipped giving a business card to Jiang YaGe, who was also standing next to her.She left with Xu WeiWei at a leisurely pace after giving Zhong Yi her business card.After they had left, Xu WeiWei asked, \u201cWhat made you want to have an adopted daughter out of the blue?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be a nice thing to do,\u201d replied Fang JunRong nonchalantly.She\u2019d extend the olive branch to Zhong Yi, and it\u2019s up to her whether or not to make good use of the opportunity.Xu WeiWei shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like someone who likes to randomly adopt someone.\u201d With her status, she\u2019d have unlimited options for an adopted daughter if she spread the words that she was looking for one.Fang JunRong said, \u201cNothing much. I just felt that it might not be a bad thing to have one more person to split the pie that\u2019s Li WangJin\u2019s inheritance, since he enjoys being a nice guy so much.\u201d Then, after a slight hesitation, she said, \u201cDo you think I should go adopt a few more?\u201dMaybe adopt enough for a soccer team?The corners of Xu WeiWei\u2019s mouth twitched. Was it her imagination? She hasn\u2019t met up with Fang JunRong for a while, and her friend seemed to be deviating from the norm now. Hmm, her behavior must be the result of all the sh*t that Li WangJin had pulled! Li WangJin, scumbag!\u201cLet\u2019s go and buy some jewelry.\u201dWhy did she need to be frugal for the Li\u2019s? The more she spent, the merrier!***Inside the private room, Zhong Yi clutched tightly onto the business card. She felt like she was walking on clouds right now. She must be dreaming, right?\u201cXiao Yi, do you think she\u2019s a con artist? She wants to lure you over to her place and kidnap you.\u201d Jiang YaGe\u2019s voice brought Zhong Yi back to reality.\u201cI don\u2019t think so? Just look at that Young Master Gu. He even let us go because of her. With Young Master Gu\u2019s status, many have to kowtow to him,\u201d said Zhong Yi.\u201cEven if she didn\u2019t interfere, that Young Master Gu wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to us anyway,\u201d said Jiang YaGe.Zhong Yi gave Jiang YaGe a curious look and asked, \u201cDo you not like her, YeGe? Boss Fang had helped us out. She\u2019s a good person.\u201d Especially when she didn\u2019t dislike her right away because of her look. She was very friendly to her the entire time.Jiang YaGe\u2019s look froze on her for a little while, and she added, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. I just think that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch and didn\u2019t want you to be tricked. You are my best friend and I\u2019d hate to see anything bad happen to you.\u201dZhong Yi looked down at the business card again. \u201cHer name is on here, Fang JunRong\u2026. It sounds so familiar.\u201dHaving said that, she fished out her cellphone and searched the name. Immediately, she gasped.\u201cOh, my god! Look, she\u2019s the co-owner of Ayron with her husband. Her picture is right on here and that\u2019s really her!\u201d There was ecstasy in her voice. \u201cOh my, she is already in her forties, but she looked so young in person.\u201dShe looked out of it for a while. Was her luck finally going to turn after her years of misfortune?Jiang YaGe frowned a little and bit her lips a little in surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li WangJin expressed that both kids listened to her more and asked Fang JunRong to take on the task of announcing the news.The slight smile on Li WangJin froze on his face. He casted a dubious look in Fang JunRong\u2019s direction and asked, \u201cI thought it was just one?\u201d Who else other than Jiang YaGe? How come he didn\u2019t know about it?Fang JunRong gave him a perfect smile, cheerfulness radiated from her eyes and brows, and brought up Zhong Yi to him. \u201cThat kid is so pitiful. She had no parents to help her out, so I want to help her.\u201d She also briefly talked about Jiang YaGe.Li ShiZe didn\u2019t care too much about it either way. As far as he was concerned, having two more sisters just meant two more mouths to feed. The thought of the inheritance didn\u2019t even cross his mind. The way he looked at it, his parents would never leave their inheritance to any outsiders.Li XinYun pouted unhappily. \u201cAre they going to be living with us?\u201d She didn\u2019t like it that way. She felt that her personal space at home had been encroached upon.Li WangJin frowned. \u201cShe works at White Crane\u201d? What kind of a nice girl would work at a place like that?\u201dThere was a hit of distaste in his voice. Obviously ,he looked down upon someone of Zhong Yi\u2019s status, but more so than that, he was disgruntled that his wife wanted to adopt another girl without even running it by him first. For a family like theirs, adopting a child was more than just adding an extra pair of chopsticks. When they get married, they would for sure have to prepare some dowry.Fang JunRong chuckled to herself; ah, the world\u2019s #1 double standard man, Li WangJin. Didn\u2019t Jiang YaGe work at the same place? In his eyes, she was the goddess who was not corrupted by an environment like that. She was a kind and strong girl. Granted, there was a good chance that he didn\u2019t know all about Jiang YaGe\u2019s past. As it wasn\u2019t something to be proud about, Jiang YaGe most likely did not share with others willy-nilly.Fang JunRong suddenly looked forward to the day of Jiang YaGe\u2019s arrival.As much as she was talking sh*t about Li WangJin, she maintained a tender look. \u201cThat kid only works there to pay for her grandmother\u2019s medical bill. That\u2019s why I wanted to offer her an opportunity.\u201cHer story was much sadder than that of Jiang YaGe\u2019s. Since we are already adopting Jiang YaGe, I don\u2019t mind having one more daughter. Besides, I have consulted a master fortune teller. Zhong Yi\u2019s birth date will bring fortune to our family.\u201d Of course she just made up that last part on the spot.There was more that Li WangJin wanted to add, but after hearing about Jiang YaGe, he compromised \u2013 after all, Zhong Yi\u2019s past did sound worse than that of Jiang YaGe\u2019s. He opened his mouth and finally said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to be fooled was all. It\u2019s not about the money; I just don\u2019t want you to be hurt emotionally. If you like her so much, let\u2019s take her too. I still don\u2019t trust too much the character of a girl from a place like that. I will for sure observe her closely for a while.\u201dHis mouth was as smooth as it always was. He obviously didn\u2019t want to take in Zhong Yi, but the way he put it, he was just trying to protect Fang JunRong and nothing else. The more time she spent with him, the more she was disgusted by his hypocriticalness.After that, he shared some stories that he had heard in the business world. They more or less summed up to how some girls from the club were manipulative and became the men\u2019s mistresses. And the more talented ones were able to force away their wives and take their spots.A few stories later, he was able to label everyone from a place like that as \u201cmanipulative\u201d or \u201cmoney-grubbing\u201d, etc.Zhong Yi wasn\u2019t even here yet, but judging from the looks on both her son Li ShiZe and her daughter Li XinYun, they\u2019ve already had a poor conception of Zhong Yi. Li WangJin was indirectly faceslapping Fang JunRong, but Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t upset at all.Oh yeah? Go on. Say some more. Everything that he said now would turn into slaps that would land on Jiang YaGe when the time came.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She did a DNA test behind their back and the result came back negative.That was another point that she had never figured out.After Fang JunRong returned to her room, about half an hour later, her precious daughter Li XinYun finally came over. Seeing her look with \u201cunhappy\u201d written all over it, Fang JunRong only felt that she missed that a lot.Smiling, she said, \u201cYou waited half an hour before you came over this time. That\u2019s an improvement.\u201dLi XinYun grunted with a slightly prideful look, \u201cWhen mom has two more precious daughters, I would be worthless.\u201dFang JunRong shook her head, \u201cYou will always be my more precious treasure. Nobody can measure up to that.\u201d\u201cNot even older brother?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d said Fang JunRong without any hesitation. Had she transmigrated to 20 years earlier, she\u2019d have just aborted that slab of pork directly.Surely, Li XinYun\u2019s look mellowed down. A baffled look on her pretty little face, she asked, \u201cWhat made you suddenly want to adopt daughters, Mom?\u201dFang JunRong knew that her daughter wasn\u2019t good at playing games. If she found out before the divorce, she just might slip and let something out. Plus, Li WangJin had always played the role of a good father up until the point that Jiang YaGe had joined them.She patted her on her head and said, \u201cMom will tell you the truth in six months\u2019 time.\u201dShe\u2019d for sure have the divorce taken care of in 6-months\u2019 time. Plus, once Jiang YaGe had joined them, XinYun would more or less pick up something.As she was given such a specific time frame, Li XinYun couldn\u2019t help but feel that her mom had her reasons. She had no choice but to accept it.\u201cOkay. If it\u2019s just 6 months\u2019 time. I can wait.\u201d She balled her hands up into fists. Her cute look made Fang JunRong laugh. Her biggest purpose after her rebirth was to protect her daughter\u2019s smile.\u201cThis is a secret between the two of us, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter placating her daughter, Fang JunRong had freed herself up more to take care of other matters. The next few days, most of what she was doing was to purchase stuff and another place to live.She had expected Zhong Yi to reach out to her quickly after she had given her her business card. When she hadn\u2019t heard from her until Thursday, she was quite surprised.Fang JunRong thought about it for a little and decided to make a trip to White Crane and talk to Zhong Yi directly. Sure enough, Zhong Yi was at work today. After seeing Fang JunRong, Zhong Yi was stunned for a little while, and then she teared up in the next second but she quickly wiped that away.Choking back her tears, she said, \u201cBoss Fang.\u201dFang JunRong had a slight smile on her and said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d be giving me a call.\u201dAfter she had wiped away her tears, her cherry-blossom eyes were even brighter than they were before. She said to her, \u201cI put your business card away the other day, but somehow I wasn\u2019t able to find it again. I have spent so much time looking for it\u2026\u201dShe thought she had lost her chance for good. She never expected Fang JunRong to show up in front of her again, seeking her out herself. She had contemplated whether Fang JunRong had other ulterior motives. But then again, she was just a normal girl, what could Fang JunRong possibly get from her?She dare not reach out to Fang JunRong without the business card.Fang JunRong was a little dubious, \u201cI thought you\u2019d save my phone number.\u201dZhong Yi sniffled and said, \u201cI lost your business card and felt like I had lost the invitation. I didn\u2019t dare to contact you\u2026\u201dFang JunRong could understand how she was feeling. All in all, Zhong Yi felt too many uncertainties, plus her inferiority complex.She recollected herself and said to her, \u201cThere will be a banquet at my place on Sunday night. Why don\u2019t you come by then? Give me your address, I will send a chauffeur to go pick you up. You can quit your job here now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe casually brought up Jiang YaGe, \u201cOh, right, where\u2019s your friend? Is she off today?\u201d She paused a little and added a plausible explanation. \u201cShe looked like someone that a friend had been looking for for her magazine. I thought I could refer her to my friend.\u201dZhong Yi shook her head. \u201cYaGe took the day off. But I will let her know.\u201dFang JunRong was just asking. Judging from the fact that she had taken the time off, more likely than not, Li WangJin had already told her that he\u2019d be adopting her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was gone the next day.\u201d She regretted so much not bringing it home with her.Fang JunRong thought of something. After she had returned, she called up Ning Qing, the owner of White Crane. Ning Qing and her were acquaintances, and she trusted that there would be security cameras in the employee\u2019s lounge. The business card couldn\u2019t get lost by itself. Perhaps, someone didn\u2019t want to see Zhong Yi\u2019s luck changed.Fang JunRong hung up the phone with Ning Qing after promising to take her to lunch someday.After that, Fang JunRong waited till Sunday\u2019s arrival. Both Li WangJin and the kids would be home that day. Fang JunRong took Li XinYun for a makeover early that morning and made her look glamorous and perfect.She pulled out a ruby necklace that she had purchased a couple of days ago and put it on her daughter. She had been spending a lot of money as of late. Perhaps Li WangJin had a guilty conscience, so as much as he wasn\u2019t happy about it, the most he\u2019d do was to prompt that they should save some money for their son to start his business.Like Fang JunRong cared what he had to say about it.Li XinYun liked the necklace a lot. Even though she owned a lot of jewelry, a gem this size was still rare. That truly convinced her that her mother loved her the most and also made her able to remain calm and composed when her two new sisters arrived.Zhong Yi arrived before Jiang YaGe. When Fang JunRong sent someone to pick her up, she also hired a makeup artist to help doll her up. She had on a fuchsia colored ball gown. She looked as glamorous as a peony in her dress and her being in and of itself was a gorgeous scene. It was obvious that she was a little nervous and was gripping onto her dress reflexively.Obviously, her look wasn\u2019t the type that Li WangJin and Li ShiZe father and son duo could appreciate. Especially Li WangJin, he had already frowned deeply.Fang JunRong, on the other hand, was in a good mood. \u201cCome over, Zhong Yi. This is your younger sister XinYun.\u201dHer voice slowly calmed Zhong Yi\u2019s nerves. She walked in front of Li XinYun and said in a somewhat appeasing tone, \u201cXinYun-meimei.\u201d*Li XinYun nicely curved her lips up a little and said, \u201cJiejie.\u201d*(T/N: Meimei \u2013 younger sister and jiejie \u2013 older sister)Li WangJin said indifferently, \u201cNow that you have joined the Li\u2019s, you must keep in mind your status. You must lose those bad habits that you have picked up at those shady establishments.\u201dObviously, he wanted to show who was the boss there.Zhong Yi turned a little pale but dared not talk back.Fang JunRong, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t happy about it. She said, \u201cI say Zhong Yi looks pretty good. She is pretty like a flower. Just looking at her is pleasing.\u201dLi WangJin said no more but just looked in the direction of the front door. He was obviously waiting for Jiang YaGe to show up.In his desperate wait, Jiang YaGe finally arrived. She had on a white dress today and even her makeup was that of a young girl, fragile, pure, and attractive. Her lips that were the color of cherry blossoms made her appear especially lovable.Li WangJin\u2019s frown disappeared immediately when he saw Jiang YaGe. His voice couldn\u2019t be any more tender, as though he might startle her inadvertently. \u201cYaGe, you are here.\u201dZhong Yi looked at her in disbelief. She didn\u2019t know that her good friend, too, was being adopted by the Li\u2019s.Fang JunRong put on a surprised look at the right time and said, \u201cOh, hey, it\u2019s you.\u201dLi WangJin asked, \u201cJunRong, you have met YaGe before?\u201dFang JunRong said in a most cheerful tone, \u201cOh yes. I met her at White Crane. She was working there alongside Zhong Yi. What a coincidence. Fate can manifest itself in such an interesting way.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked over at Li WangJin and Li ShiZe reflexively. She was worried that she\u2019d see a look of disgust on them.She was so happy when she got the call from Uncle Li. She didn\u2019t think someone who was orphaned and being targeted from all directions would have the luck to become the adopted daughter of the Li\u2019s. She had seen Uncle Li\u2019s picture and knew that he was one of the top wealthiest people in the country. She had further looked him up on the web and learned that Fang JunRong was his wife. She just hadn\u2019t expected her to freely point out that she had worked at White Crane the moment that they\u2019ve met right in front of everyone else.She couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of grievance. She only worked there for her tuition; not like Zhong Yi at all. Even though she worked at a place like that, she had always taken the precautions to protect herself and not let herself be corrupted. Nor had she ever associated herself with any of the wealthy men outside of work.Her eyes reddened, and her tears rolled around in them.Li WangJin had on him a look of disbelief, as though someone had just b*tch slapped him. His well-maintained features twisted on his face, and he had lost all his usual elegance. He had talked down so much on people from the clubs, only to find out that the girl whom he thought of as his own daughter had also worked at a place like that. But YaGe was such an innocent and kind-looking girl!No. He must believe in YaGe. She was not like the others. She must have her own reasons for doing that.He took a deep breath and finally was able to sort out his emotions. Before he was able to say anything, Fang JunRong had already beat him to the punch, and her words sounded all so familiar at that.\u201cWhat kind of a nice girl would work at a place like that?\u201cNow that you have joined the Li\u2019s, you must keep in mind your status. You must lose those bad habits that you have picked up at those shady establishments.\u201dShe remembered what Li WangJin had said clearly, and now she could repeat them word by word.Jiang YaGe was so hurt by those caustic words that tears rolled down her cheeks right then and there. Her body shook and made her look all the more pitiful.After Fang JunRong had repeated all of Li WangJin words from earlier, she finally slowly added, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what your Uncle Li said earlier. I told him he should not have preconceptions about people, but he just wouldn\u2019t listen. I trust that you are both good kids. Especially Zhong Yi, she only worked there for her grandmother\u2019s medical bills. She\u2019s so pure coming out of the place like that.\u201dLi WangJin was completely speechless. He hadn\u2019t expected that his wife would just blurt out all of those words right in front of YaGe with no regard. Had he known that YaGe had worked at places like that, he would never have said what he said. Great, YaGe might have misunderstood him now.\u201cI trust YaGe\u2019s character. She must have her reasons.\u201dJiang YaGe found her voice once again and said, \u201cI\u2026 I worked there for my tuition.\u201dLi WangJin let out a sigh of relief. He was just about to praise her when his daughter chimed in.\u201cFor your tuition? You can\u2019t even afford to pay for your tuition?\u201dJiang YaGe sniffled, looking like she was going to cry again anytime and said, \u201cMy uncle and my other relatives had taken away all the money that my parents had left for me.\u201dLi WangJin was angry for her. \u201cYour uncle is such an evil person!\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you apply for a student loan? Isn\u2019t that very easy to get?\u201d said Li XinYun.Jiang YaGe, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t want others to look at her that way. Never mind a student loan, she didn\u2019t even apply for financial aid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li XinYun was her precious daughter after all, getting straight to the point. But judging by the way that Jiang YaGe dressed, it wasn\u2019t difficult to see that most of the money that she had made went there. It was obviously that Li WangJin did not buy her the outfit that she was wearing today. Li WangJin was a man. He would not have thought about something like that.Neither her clothes or her shoes were of the expensive brands, but the entire set probably cost upward of $5,000.Li XinYun went on, \u201cI thought you get good grades at school. Couldn\u2019t you have gotten a scholarship?\u201dJiang YaGe, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was lucky that she even got into this prestigious school, never mind having grades that were good enough for a scholarship.Fang JunRong smiled slightly and said, \u201cI seem to recall that Zhong Yi has a scholarship?\u201dZhong Yi took a look at her good friend and quickly added, \u201cI lucked out and got decent grades.\u201d She has been keeping up with her studying every day after work. Plus, she was a pretty smart girl, and her grades had always been pretty good.Li XinYun took a look at her father. Her voice was slightly accusatory as she said, \u201cDad, you\u2019ve always been bragging about YaGe-jiejie\u2019s grades in front of me and said that I should learn from her. But she couldn\u2019t even get a scholarship. What kind of a cum laude is she? She\u2019s not like big brother who gets the top honor every year. Now, that\u2019s what I\u2019d call a cum laude.\u201dLi XinYun didn\u2019t like Jiang YaGe much as her father had been singing Jiang YaGe\u2019s praises in front of her for the last few days. And not just praising Jiang YaGe; he must beat her down to contrast her with Jiang YaGe. She got pretty decent grades at the college entrance examination as well and also got into one of the prominent colleges. What was so bad about her? She was a little happy that she was able to gain back some lost ground today. Plus, over the last few days, she was able to pick up some signs that the relationship between her parents wasn\u2019t as good as they were in the past.And, right at this moment, the person who felt the most awkward, other than Jiang YaGe, was Li WangJin. He couldn\u2019t possibly tell his daughter that in his eyes, everything about Jiang YaGe was good.He took a look at Jiang YaGe and let out a light sigh. Jiang YaGe, after all, wasn\u2019t as good as her mother. No matter how much they look alike, they were still two different people.Looking at the scene unfolding in front of her, Fang JunRong was reminded of her previous life. Jiang YaGe\u2019s arrival in her previous life wasn\u2019t at all like this. Li WangJin raved about her, and her BBQ-pork son grew fond of her; the setting was quite harmonious.She lifted the corners of her mouth a little and said, \u201cAlright, the two kids had just got here. I know that you want to teach them what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, but there\u2019s no rush. I know that you are blunt and you only had their best interest in mind when you say those hurtful words. But we don\u2019t want them to have a misconception about you now.\u201dHearing that, Li WangJin almost puked out blood. How did she make it sound like it was all his fault? He felt stifled but couldn\u2019t find the right words to talk back, so he could do nothing but to sit down in dismay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was able to quickly relax the both nervous Zhong Yi and Jiang YaGe. She further told them where their rooms would be and have their servants bring their suitcases into their respective rooms. Both Jiang YaGe and Zhong Yi\u2019s rooms were on the first floor, quite a distance from Li ShiZe\u2019s.She didn\u2019t know was going through Li WangJin\u2019s head in her previous life. He insisted that Jiang YaGe take the room next to Li ShiZe\u2019s. She heard that Jiang YaGe had inadvertently walked into Li ShiZe\u2019s room. Well, she didn\u2019t think Jiang YaGe would be able to make that mistake again during this lifetime.After dinner, Fang JunRong pulled out the gifts that she had prepared ahead of time. As for Li WangJin, he probably didn\u2019t even think about it.\u201cI have some welcoming gifts for the two of you.\u201dWhat she had prepared for Zhong Yi was a set of gold jewellery. After all, Zhong Yi was the one who was more strapped for money. Gold has always been the acceptable currency. This set that she was gifting her cost at least $300,000. As she was expensing it on the company\u2019s book, she didn\u2019t feel a thing spending that kind of money.As Jiang YeGe looked at the magnificent set of gold jewelries, Jiang YaGe\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation. She saw Fang JunRong handed her a box the next second. She accepted the box and noticed that it was very light in weight.Eh. So light. This couldn\u2019t be jewelry then.She opened it up and saw a painting. Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t familiar with paintings, so she couldn\u2019t tell who\u2019s work it was, nor did she know how much it was worth.\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026\u201d Li WangJin almost stopped breathing for a second there. His hands were trembling.Fang JunRong smiled and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the work of Xu FangWeng? I like YaGe a lot, so I want her to have this. Haven\u2019t you mentioned before that YaGe doesn\u2019t care about those common items? I felt that jewelries are too common, so I thought about it some and thought this would make a good gift for her.\u201dShe had already had someone appraised it and confirmed that this was a fake. Hoho. It\u2019d be too wasteful to keep it herself, so she might as well recycle it and give it to Jiang YaGe. From now on, she\u2019d gift Jiang YaGe some of the imitation goods every year on her birthday. She might as well recycle and declutter.Jiang YaGe had, indeed, heard of Xu FangWeng. This meant that this was very valuable. She was worried that Fang JunRong didn\u2019t like her much, but she felt much better after receiving this gift. This painting was probably more valuable than that jewelry set. No work of Xu FangWeng would go for below $500,000.\u201cThank you, Aunty. I like this gift a lot, and I will always treasure it.\u201dFang JunRong put on her perfect performance and said, \u201cWhy are you still calling me \u2018Aunty\u2019? You should be calling me \u2018Mom\u2019.\u201d\u201cMom.\u201dJiang YaGe lowered her head. She looked a little shy, and her innocent face was filled with happiness. Her eyes sparkled like stars in the sky and made her look even more attractive.Li ShiZe, who had been quiet the entire night was a little enthralled. Even though Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t the prettiest girl he had ever seen and was at most decent, there was something special about her when she smiled. But, remembering that Jiang YaGe didn\u2019t even know to apply for financial aid, he couldn\u2019t help but also associate the label of idiot with her.Looking at how the scene was unfolding, Li WangJin felt that he\u2019d need some nitroglycerin. He wanted to stop it from happening, but he couldn\u2019t come up with a good enough reason. He had no choice but to watch on as Jiang YaGe carefully put away the box in a cherish way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They\u2019d pick a time, hold a banquet and officially introduce the two of them to the others. As for the timing of this event, they\u2019d really need to give it some thought.It was late at night when Fang JunRong returned to her own bedroom. Ever since her re-birth, she could no longer stand staying in the same room as Li WangJin. Their mansion was quite big anyway and has many rooms. All Fang JunRong needed to do was to clean out a room and move into it.Of course, she also made up some lackadaisical excuse that she hasn\u2019t been feeling well lately, so she hired some fengshui master to check on her. She was told that the original room wasn\u2019t good for her health. Li WangJin didn\u2019t think too much about it and that\u2019s how the two ended up in different bedrooms.She used to enjoy having a small glass of wine before bed. She had since lost that habit since her re-birth. In her previous life, someone had added drugs in her wine that caused her to have bad temperament. For a while there, she had a very quick temper and would snap for no reasons all the time.In her previous life, she was truly surrounded by enemies from all directions.Thinking about it for a while, Fang JunRong laid down in bed and got ready to go to sleep. She didn\u2019t forget to lock the door from the inside, however. She wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a figment of her imagination, but the moment she closed her eyes, she seemed to have seen a slight green glow that bubbled up then quickly disappeared.***Fang JunRong knew that she was dreaming. Oddly, she had dreamt before, but in none of them she felt as awake as she was right now. She noticed that she was standing on top of a mountain. The mountain was so tall it reached into the clouds. She was surrounded by the clouds, and it felt like she was in some fantasyland.She had never been here before and had no idea why she\u2019d dream about it, but most dreams were not logical. It wasn\u2019t a big deal dreaming about a mountain that she had never seen before.She saw a stone tablet not too far away from her. The tablet seemed to be glowing and looked very unusual.Perhaps because it was a dream, Fang JunRong was braver than usual and walked directly toward the tablet. The language on the tablet wasn\u2019t one that she recognized; it all seemed very metaphysical. Nonetheless, when she reached out to touch the tablet, it seemed to have translated for her right away, and she could understand what was written on it all of a sudden.11 gram of duruo (East Asian pollia), 100 gram of yunyingcao\u2026Eh? That looked like a prescription. Okay, she had heard of duruo, but she didn\u2019t think she had ever heard of anything called yunyingcao. Out of curiosity, Fang JunRong still tried very hard to commit the prescription to her memory.Even so, she was only able to read the top two of the prescriptions. The rest of the content on the tablet might as well have matrix over it, and she wasn\u2019t able to make out anything from them. There was a book carved on the upper right-hand corner of the tablet. More surprisingly, the book was flipping through the pages automatically. It was not scientific that a carved book could be animated.But, since it was a dream, nothing needed to be logical at all.After her initial shock, Fang JunRong quickly recollected herself and felt that she had no problem with the logic at all. A dream was a dream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the next second, the book turned into a stream of light and entered her through her finger tips.Fang JunRong gasped and the massive amount of information gave her a huge headache.[Jiang YaGe, in her dress that was starting to turn white from being washed too many times, was standing in front of the delicate mansion that looked like it came straight out of a painting. Her heart pounding in her chest. Was she really going to join the Li\u2019s?Before her mother passed away, she had told Jiang YaGe that she could look to Uncle Li for help if she ran into trouble. She had told her that Uncle Li would help her because of their relationship from college. But Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t too confident about that. The Li\u2019s was on the list of top wealthiest families in the country. Would they really have the time of the day for her?If her cousin didn\u2019t scam her out of all the money that she had made over her summer vacation leaving her with no tuition for the next semester, she would never have come.She got her courage up and was just about to press the doorbell when a luxurious car pulled up. The car door opened, and a young and pretty girl exited the car. Jiang YaGe looked at the dress that the girl was wearing \u2014 she has seen that brand on a magazine before. It cost tens of thousands of dollars. That dress itself cost more than her four years of tuition combined. She felt a sense of inferiority complex bubbling inside of her.The girl gave her a look in surprise and asked in her crisp voice, \u201cAre you here to interview for the maid position?\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s face turned beet red. The feeling of disgrace was so strong that her eyes turned red immediately, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d\u2026..]The book was quite long with Jiang YaGe being the female lead. At the beginning, Fang JunRong thought this was just a fictitious novel until the content matched up with everything had happened in her past.In the book, after Jiang YaGe had joined the Li\u2019s, she met Li WangJin, who treated her as though she was his own daughter; the cold and handsome Li ShiZe; the elegant but distant Fang JunRong; and Li XinYun, who\u2019d always antagonize her.She had always been fond of Li ShiZe, and Li ShiZe seemed to have some feelings for her as well, but neither one pursued it. Until one time, during a banquet, Jiang YaGe drank a little too much, walked into the wrong room, and had intimacy with Li ShiZe. Li ShiZe was attracted to her body, and the two began their hidden love affair. Li ShiZe even stole his mother\u2019s bracelet and gave it Jiang YaGe as a gift.Jiang YaGe had always hid the bracelet underneath her sleeve until the day that Fang JunRong accidentally cut her finger on a sheet of paper. Jiang YaGe wanted to appease her lover\u2019s mother, so she offered to help her clean up her wound. She had accidentally touched Fang JunRong\u2019s blood during the process.After she returned to her room and was appreciating the bracelet, the door to a whole new world opened up for her when Fang JunRong\u2019s blood came into contact with the bracelet. It was a wonderland in and of itself inside the bracelet. There was a mystical mountain, a spring, and some prescriptions that could only belong to a wonderland.She had stealthily created these prescriptions and that had allowed her to establish and secure her relationships with many big bosses. She became their goddaughter and became a natural in the upper-class circle. She went from an orphan to an ideal person in many people\u2019s minds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Xiao felt madly in love with her ever since then. He was cold and vicious in front of others, but would always show her his soft side.She helped Fang JueMing, the film emperor whose fingers were fractured by someone. The film emperor, too, fell in love with her. He\u2019d always guard her when she was hurt like her knight in shining armor.She made a pact with Zhang Bi, a genius doctor, who was finally conquered by her pure but stubborn personality. He even drugged Fang JunRong for her, making Fang JunRong always have a bad temper and sometimes even hallucinations.Original translation is from fuyuneko dot org. If you\u2019re reading this elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.She was surrounded by all sorts of high-quality men, which made Li ShiZe jealous. As both Fang JunRong and Li XinYun didn\u2019t like her, and her good friend Zhong Yi had also fallen in love with Li ShiZe, the relationship between Jiang YaGe and Li ShiZe had to overcome one obstacle after another. All the break ups and make ups only strengthened their relationships. There were also a few of Jiang YaGe\u2019s male friends who were fond of Jiang YaGe, and some villainess female supporting characters who wanted to break up Jiang YaGe and Li ShiZe.Her good friend Zhong Yi tried repeatedly to set her up and harm her. Finally, all the truth came out, and she was sold to some poor village and life was hellish for her.As for Li XinYun, as she has always antagonized Jiang YaGe, she was finally set up by Wang Xiao and given to one of his goons as a toy. In the end, she broke down and finally committed suicide.Fang JunRong, on the other hand, was sent to the mental institution personally by Li WangJin and Li ShiZe.Jiang YaGe ended up with a father-in-law who doted on her, a husband who loved her with his life, and a happy life. After she found out the death of Fang JunRong, a few tears rolled down her cheeks, but deep down inside, she let out a sigh of relief.On the other hand, Li WangJin also became a couple with Jiang YaGe\u2019s aunt. As it turned out, Li WangJin was very fond of Wang SiEr, Jiang YaGe\u2019s mother, when he was younger. Jiang YaGe\u2019s aunt was her twin, and the two of them looked very much alike. As far as Li WangJin was concerned, he was finally with \u201cthe one who got away\u201d.***From Jiang YaGe\u2019s perspective, there was only some bitterness at the beginning of her life. Then, she was surrounded by all sorts of men, and the entire book turned into a cheerful and satisfying read. It was also like a class A drama where the story arc went up and down and reeling in all the audiences.Fang JunRong, on the other hand, could almost bleed from her eyes with hatred.She hated Jiang YaGe, but she hated her son Li ShiZe and her husband Li WangJin even more. Never mind that Jiang YaGe used her own treasure against her. Not only did Li ShiZe, her BBQ-pork son, steal her bracelet for love and handed a cheat over to Jiang YaGe, he proceeded to treat both her and her daughter cruelly.Li WangJin\u2019s heart had always been on Wang SiEr, yet he had courted her, married her, and never forgot about Wang SiEr for even a day.No wonder. No wonder he was so nice to Jiang YaGe and scolded XinYun repeatedly for Jiang YaGe.It was her own fault that she hadn\u2019t seen through all this until it was too late in her previous life. When she realized it, she was already stuck in a very bad situation. Perhaps, even Heaven couldn\u2019t sit by and watch those people commit disgustingly evil acts and that was why it had given her a chance for a redo.Fang JunRong opened her eyes again. She could still feel a throbbing headache, and the book that she had just read was carved into her mind clearly.Perseverance could be seen in her eyes, and her smile was a little cold.Thanks to the book, she had a good idea of how to get a divorce now. As Li WangJin had never forgotten about his white moonlight, he was willing to be with Jiang YaGe\u2019s aunt instead. Alright, she would see to it that they become a couple!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bracelet was handed down to her by her grandmother. She was her grandmother\u2019s favorite before she passed away. She had always kept the bracelet inside her safe, except that both her son and daughter knew the codes to her safe, which was why it wasn\u2019t difficult for Li ShiZe to get his hand on the bracelet.How dare her BBQ-Pork son Li ShiZe steal her bracelet for Jiang YaGe? Most of her and her daughter\u2019s terrible end in her previous life was brought on by him. What she couldn\u2019t figure out was, why did Li ShiZe steal it for Jiang YaGe out of the blue? He had plenty of money and could totally buy jewellery for her had he wanted to. It was very unfortunate that part wasn\u2019t mentioned in the book; it only mentioned how happy Jiang YaGe was after receiving the bracelet.She pulled out a small knife and cut herself on her fingertip and smeared her blood onto the bracelet. Her blood, however, never stained the bracelet. Instead, it soaked through into it right away and disappeared like it never happened. And, at the same time, she went back to the same mystical mountain once again.Miraculously, after her blood had soaked through, the prescriptions on the tablet had changed a lot. It went from the original two to now three:White Jade Cream: Has the ability to enhance muscle growth. It will not revive a person, but will enhance bone growth from the bone.Beautify Pill: As the name suggests, a prescription for skin care.Detoxification Pill: Has the ability to remove toxins from the body.There were a few items in these prescriptions that did not exist in the real world but were available in the mystical mountain. The Beautify Pill needed the water from the spring. In some ways, reading Jiang YaGe\u2019s novel allowed her to take a lot of shortcuts.The reason that Jiang YaGe was able to recruit so many powerful supporters in her previous life was because she was the only one who was able to create these drugs and monopolized on all three of them.In this lifetime, she\u2019d for sure keep the bracelet safe. Without the bracelet, she wondered how far Jiang YaGe could go.After Fang JunRong collected a few types of the mystical herbs from the wonderland and went back to the real world, she noticed that her bracelet was gone. Technically, the bracelet was still there, but it turned into a very faint, green mark around her wrist. One has to look very carefully to know that it was there.And, she was able to return to the wonderland with just a thought in her mind.She let out a sigh of relief. That\u2019s good. This way she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it being stolen again. Plus, the bracelet could also double as storage. She could put in there some of her favorite jewelry and housing deeds.She left the house the next day and went to another property of hers and created all three types of prescription herself. Precision during the process was very important. She was very precise every step of the way and succeeded. The final products, as Fang JunRong had noticed, also have an oddly refreshing scent, especially the Detoxification Pill. Just a whiff of it would make one feel more energetic and all their tiredness gone.Fang JunRong was cautious though. This was her first time after all. She couldn\u2019t be entirely certain that she made no mistake during the process. She bought some small animals and tested out all three types of drugs. She must say that the prescriptions from the wonderland were extraordinary. New flesh started to grow just one day after the White Jade Cream was applied. The Detoxification Pill was amazing as well. A rabbit that was on the brim of dying from poison regained its energy shortly after having the pill.As for the Beauty Pills, she couldn\u2019t tell the effects on the animals, but judging from the fact that they were still bouncing around after taking them, she knew it was probably safe to take. Fang JunRong decided to take it herself. When push came to shove, she still had the Detoxification Pill.After taking the pills three days in a row, she was able to tell that her skin had tightened and was a shade lighter than it was before. She looked like she had the filter on in a picture. All women liked to be pretty. One could imagine how crazy the general public would be once it hit the market.Fang JunRong was very surprised. She had further taken a trip to the hospital, just to make sure there was nothing wrong with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was in the habit of travelling overseas from time to time, so nobody suspected anything when they hadn\u2019t seen her for a week. At most, they\u2019d ask her a few questions here and there.When she went home, her daughter XinYun was sitting on the couch and \u201cI am very angry\u201d was written all over her. Jiang YaGe was standing nearby with a look of embarrassment. Li WangJin was waiting by XinYun with the same intensity of anger.\u201cI had spoiled you so. That\u2019s why you have become such a selfish person. Why can\u2019t you be more like YaGe?\u201dLi XinYun exploded. \u201cI had been planning for my birthday banquet for months! Why should I cancel it for her? I should thoughtful for her? Who\u2019s going to be thoughtful for me? I have already sent out the invitations to all of my friends!\u201d\u201cIs YaGe not more important than those friends of yours? You can invite them again next year.\u201d Li WangJin also refused to give an inch. Veins could be seen on his forehead, and he had reached his limit.\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Fang JunRong interrupted the explosive atmosphere. She knew full well what was going on. This same event had taken place in her previous life as well. XinYun\u2019s birthday was also the anniversary of Jiang YaGe\u2019s parents\u2019 death. Li WangJin had gone ahead and cancelled it using the reason that he didn\u2019t want Jiang YaGe to be upset with the celebration on that day.Fang JunRong didn\u2019t agree to cancelling it back then, and she got into a big fight with Li WangJin. But Li WangJin acted preemptively and sent a notice of cancellation to all of the guests himself. XinYun completely hated Jiang YaGe after this incident and started to antagonize her going forward.Li WangJin tried to suppress his anger and said, \u201cLook at her, fighting with me day in and day out. That\u2019s not how a girl should behave. I think we have spoiled her too much before. That\u2019s why she is so disrespectful to her elders now.\u201dFang JunRong wasn\u2019t going to remain silent. \u201cXinYun is very respectful to me. If you don\u2019t want a daughter like her, I can leave with her right now.\u201d Fang JunRong regretted not encouraging her daughter to go on a short trip before she took off to do her experiments. That way, XinYun wouldn\u2019t have to stay home and put up with this.Li WangJin\u2019s look turned blank all of a sudden. His voice weakened and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dJiang YaGe put on a very reasonable look and said, \u201cDon\u2019t fight with little sister over me, dad. This is my fault.\u201dFang JunRong nodded and said, \u201cYes, it is your fault. WangJin had never scolded XinYun like that before you came.\u201d Li WangJin had never been a great father, but at least, he had always put up the front in the past.Li XinYun gave Jiang YaGe a stare and said, \u201cExactly. My dad has been picking on me day in and day out ever since you\u2019ve come. I think he wishes that you are his daughter instead.\u201dLi XinYun had never been treated like this before.Perhaps, because Fang JunRong was here now, Li WangJin dared not act the same way as he did earlier. His tone mellowed out a lot and said, \u201cXinYun\u2019s birthday is August 16, the same day that YaGe\u2019s parents passed away. I just thought we could cancel the birthday party this year so we won\u2019t upset YaGe.\u201d\u201cWere YaGe\u2019s parents our elders as well? Is that why our entire family needs to observe the anniversary of their death?\u201dWhat the h*ll was he talking about?Li WangJin stumbled for words for a little and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean\u2026\u201dFang JunRong pursed her lips a little and asked, \u201cIs this your idea or YaGe\u2019s?\u201d\u201cIt was my idea. YaGe never brought it up,\u201d said Li WangJin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Haven\u2019t you always been telling me how thoughtful and kind a person YaGe is? Would someone like that want to see XinYun sad by canceling the birthday party that she has been looking forward to?\u201d\u201cI trust that that\u2019s not the kind of person that YaGe is.\u201dFang JunRong turned to look at Jiang YaGe and said to her, somewhat aggressively, \u201cAm I right, YaGe?\u201dAfter words had gotten out about this issue in her previous life, everybody had learned the status of Jiang YaGe at the Li\u2019s. That had, however, inadvertently dealt damage to XinYun. Many made fun of the fact how the real Miss Li\u2019s status was lower than that of the adopted daughter.Now Jiang YaGe was stuck between a rock and a hard place. If she said she didn\u2019t want to see it happen, she would be offending Li WangJin, who had stood up for her. If she said she was okay with it, then she would be a bad person who didn\u2019t care about the feelings of Li XinYun. At a time like this, she chose to be a nice person.\u201cXinYun had been looking forward to this birthday banquet for a long time. There is no need to cancel it just for me. I know dad was worried about me, but XinYun\u2019s feelings should take precedence.\u201dJiang YaGe was Jiang YaGe after all. Not only was she able to make a split-second decision, but she further managed to create herself a self-sacrifice and considerate image through compromising. Looking at her reddened eyes, Li WangJin suddenly felt a sense of guilt.Fang JunRong nodded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why, WangJin, you shouldn\u2019t always be doing these things while disregarding others\u2019 feelings. Why would you do such a thing? You made XinYun sad and YaGe felt bad at the same time.\u201dLi WangJin felt very frustrated that he wasn\u2019t able to defend himself.\u201cAnd you just called XinYun selfish. Don\u2019t you think you owe her an apology?\u201dLi WangJin opened his mouth, but he couldn\u2019t force out the words \u201cI am sorry.\u201d He\u2019s the father here. Why did he need to apologize to his daughter? And then then\u2019s XinYun, she should be helping him out by saying something to smooth out the situation right about now. That kid had spent too much time with JunRong since she was just a child. She was never that close to him.When he looked over at Fang JunRong, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was just imagining it, but JunRong seemed even prettier than before. Nonetheless, the way she was toward him was even colder than usual. Was it because of YaGe? It was her idea to adopt YaGe in the first place. Then why was she unhappy about it now?YaGe said immediately, \u201cI will apologize for dad.\u201dFang JunRong said, \u201cWho\u2019d have someone else apologize for themselves? YaGe, you are a reasonable person. You should know that.\u201dJiang YaGe had no choice but to keep her mouth shut.Li WangJin couldn\u2019t bring himself to take himself a notch down and apologize to XinYun after all. He finally threw down a \u201cI need to attend a meeting. I am taking off now.\u201d And excused himself.Fang JunRong watched him run off and was amused. She suddenly felt bad for her old self. In the end, Li WangJin was a hypocritical person who wanted to put up a front on the outside to seem like he was a nice guy. As long as she could exploit that, his hands would be tied.She said to Li XinYun, \u201cI brought you some gifts. Come upstairs with me.\u201dLi XinYun, who felt redeemed watching her mother talk down her father for her, quickly stood up, passionately put her arms around Fang JunRong\u2019s, and said, \u201cOkay. Mom is always the best.\u201dJiang YaGe wanted to say something more yet she could do nothing except to watch on while Fang JunRong acted that she wasn\u2019t there at all. She felt very wronged. She had already taken a step back, why didn\u2019t she at least get a good word in return?She thought since Fang JunRong decided to adopt her, she\u2019d be nice to her. But now it looked like there was a difference between the adopted daughter and the real daughter after all. No matter how hard she tried, or how unreasonable Li XinYun was, she\u2019d never measure up to Li XinYun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This bracelet is beautiful!\u201dLi XinYun looked at the jade bracelet that her mother gave to her happily. \u201cThis is ice jade, right?\u201d As the young mistress of the Li\u2019s, she more or less has an appreciation for jewelries and gems.Fang JunRong curved her lips a little and said, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\u201cI felt like this was better than even the regular kind of ice jade. This is almost glass jade quality.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get you an even better one for your birthday.\u201d She was better of spending all the money instead of saving them for that father and son duo.Li XinYun\u2019s eyes were curved, making her look even more delicate than she normally did. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201dRemembering what had just happened in the living room, Li XinYun frowned and asked, \u201cMom, what\u2019s going on with Dad lately? He has been picking on me on just about anything ever since Jiang YaGe has arrived.\u201dLi XinYun wasn\u2019t happy to be treated by her own father that way. But given her personality, being picked on wouldn\u2019t make her back off, but to fight back even more aggressively. This wasn\u2019t her first fight with her father. They have had several fights already over the last few days.She felt that her home was feeling less and less like a home.Fang JunRong said nonchalantly, \u201cDon\u2019t mind him. You still have me.\u201dLi XinYun thought about it for a little bit then said, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Then she carried on, \u201cMom has much better eyes. Zhong Yi is much better than Jiang YaGe. At least she doesn\u2019t walk around looking like I have been bullying her day in and day out.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t particularly fond of Zhong Yi before, but now with Jiang YaGe as the contrast, her fondness toward Zhong Yi was on the rise steadily.Fang JunRong smiled and said, \u201cOkay, just don\u2019t bully her.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bully her. I have been very nice to her.\u201d Li XinYun was halfway through what she was saying when she suddenly noticed that Fang JunRong looked different today. \u201cEh, Mom, did you switch to some new cosmetics? How come your skin is looking better and better? Your makeup seems so natural today.\u201dWhat a child!She has no makeup on today at all!Fang JunRong said nonchalantly, \u201cNo, not really. I went to have a facial done a few times, that was all.\u201d\u201cWhich place? I want to go try it out too.\u201d Li XinYun\u2019s attention was quickly diverted.Fang JunRong coaxed her for a bit and was finally made to make her feel better. She planned to wait till her health report came back. If all was well, then she\u2019d let her daughter try the Beautify Pills and make her the prettiest girl at her birthday party.She also asked whether her daughter wanted to take a trip somewhere but Li XinYun rejected that idea right away. According to her, the sun was too strong lately. If she were to travel now, she might turn another shade darker. She didn\u2019t want to be the black swan on her own birthday. Fang JunRong, after all, was going by Li XinYun\u2019s preference, so she didn\u2019t push the issue.Fang JunRong then took a trip to White Crane to meet up with Xu WeiWei. Xu WeiWei was a competent person and was mostly done with the investigation in the last couple of days.Sitting across from Fang JunRong, she jumped directly to the point, \u201cThe name of the artist who painted those paintings for Li WangJin was He Ming. He had been painting for Li WangJin starting ten years ago. Li WangJin would always transfer the money to He Ming; then the money would be transferred back to another card that belonged to Li WangJin. Other than He Ming, there was another artist as well, but he disappeared three years ago. He might not have disappeared-disappeared; it was possible that he had stopped dealing with these types of transactions. Li WangJin pays $50,000 for each painting.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cWhat a frugal b*stard. He only paid $50,000 for each painting.\u201dOver the years, this He Ming had painted him at least 50 paintings.Xu WeiWei pondered for a little bit and said, \u201cSpeaking of. The law in this area had changed a bit in the last several years. Now creating and selling counterfeits is also illegal.\u201dFang JunRong nodded. \u201cEven though in the antique circle it\u2019s one\u2019s own fault for failing to spot counterfeits, that\u2019s just the unspoken rules. Ultimately it\u2019s what the law says.\u201dWith the amount that they were talking about, He Ming could be sentenced to life in prison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could insist that he is the victim in this. Or, he\u2019d blame it all on his agent.\u201dShe wanted Li WangJin to cry over his counterfeits after their divorce.She looked up and said determinately, \u201cHe Ming is doing this for money. If he can work with Li WangJin, he could also work with us. Not to mention we have dirt on him. We will send him to jail if he refuses to work with us.\u201cWe will contact him to do a big one.\u201dXu WeiWei\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that Li WangJin will take all the company\u2019s money on the books?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine too. Eventually we will end up with the money anyway,\u201d said Fang JunRong nonchalantly.She wasn\u2019t too attached to the company. Plus, Li WangJin had been slowly gaining control over the company over the years. All of the vital positions at the company were held by his people. Even if she wanted to fight him over it, it\u2019d still be costly even if she won over it. Might as well get more cash from it right now. Besides, the company\u2019s revenue had been much worse than before over the last few years.Seeing that Fang JunRong had already made up her mind, Xu WeiWei decided against trying to talk her out of it.The two of them were more or less done with their discussion when Fang JunRong gave Ning Qing, the owner of White Crane, a call.Ning Qing came over and joined them shortly and said to Fang JunRong, \u201cI have someone looking into what you\u2019ve asked me about earlier.\u201dFang JunRong had asked Ning Qing to help her look into the incident of Zhong Yi losing her business card. It wasn\u2019t too difficult of a task so Ning Qing agreed to look into it. There was some history between the two of them. When Ning Qing had ran into some troubles in the past when she had first started operating White Crane, Fang JunRong had helped her out.Ning Qing pulled out the security footage and showed it to Fang JunRong.The first scene was a short hair girl who snuck into the changing room when there was no one else, opened up the closet with a key, pulled out Zhong Yi\u2019s uniform, and retrieved the business card from Zhong Yi\u2019s pocket. Then, she tore it up and flushed it down the toilet.The next scene was the short hair girl chatting with Jiang YaGe.Ning Qing said, \u201cAccording to you. Jiang YaGe and Zhong Yi were the only two person who knew about your intention of adopting Zhong Yi. Ge Yan, the girl who tore up Zhong Yi\u2019s business card, chatted with Jiang YaGe. But we don\u2019t have audio for the footage so there\u2019s no way for me to find out what they talked about. We can only conclude that Jiang YaGe is a suspect.\u201cI have asked Ge Yan but she refused to admit that she had anything to do with Jiang YaGe. I have fired her already. I can\u2019t have someone like that working here.\u201dFang JunRong had Ning Qing send her a copy of the security footage and immediately forwarded a copy to Zhong Yi. She wasn\u2019t trying to instigate anything, but she wanted Zhong Yi to keep an eye out.After that was done. She smiled and chatted some more with Ning Qing for a while before she took off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had already quit the job at the club and would spend half a day with her grandmother at the hospital every other day. She\u2019d spend the rest of her time learning how to draw at the Li\u2019s. She had always enjoyed drawing, but never had the resource to have any proper training in it. Now that she was given the opportunity, she particularly appreciated her current life.Halfway through her drawing, her cell phone vibrated.Zhong Yi opened up her cellphone and realized that her adopted mother had sent her some messages \u2013 two video clips.Ten or so minutes later, she started at the screen at a loss. She had some speculations after she had lost the business card. She suspected her good friend on one hand, and on the other, felt that it was very wrong and dark of her to suspect her own friend like that. Perhaps, she had misplaced the card herself.But why would Jiang YaGe do that to her? She thought they were best of friends.When they started school, Zhong Yi and Jiang YaGe were not particularly close to each other. They were both considered pretty by others and were compared with each other. It was when both of them ended up working at White Crane and the secret had brought them together.In Zhong Yi\u2019s eyes, Jiang YaGe was too na\u00efve. YaGe\u2019s personality was too blunt, and it was too easy for her to be bullied on. She made Zhong Yi want to protect her and Zhong Yi did that often.All of a sudden, the newfound knowledge exploded in Zhong Yi\u2019s brain and it was drawing a blank. She wasn\u2019t sure how to face Jiang YaGe going forward.Zhong Yi heard knocking on the door and recollected herself.\u201cI have cut up some fruits that you like. You want to let me in?\u201d came Jiang YaGe\u2019s tender voice from the outside.Zhong Yi opened up the door and Jiang YaGe was standing right outside. The dress that Jiang YaGe had on was Chanel\u2019s newest design for the season and her smile was as pure as Zhong Yi had remembered.\u201cOh, you. Don\u2019t just draw all day long. You need to learn to relax from time to time. Don\u2019t push yourself too hard now.\u201dBoth her actions and her words were so thoughtful.\u201cYaGe, I found the person who stole my business card.\u201dJiang YaGe looked up and her dubious look was so genuine. \u201cI thought you\u2019ve misplaced it yourself?\u201dZhong Yi said, \u201cI mentioned it to our boss, and she looked through the security footage for me. Ge Yan was the one who took it.\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s pink lips parted a little and she looked angry. \u201cI would never have guessed. She didn\u2019t look like that kind of person.\u201dZhong Yi looked at Jiang YaGe closely, not wanting to miss any micro-expressions on her. \u201cGe Yan had admitted to it already. She said you were the one who told her about it.\u201d She tried to trick Jiang YaGe with words, but deep down inside, she still refused to believe that Jiang YaGe would do such a thing.\u201cShe was lying! Did you believe her? I thought you will always be on my side?\u201d said Jiang YaGe emotionally and her eyes started to tear up. \u201cGe Yan saw that you were very happy those few days, so she got curious and came and asked me about it. That\u2019s when I mentioned to her how Mom had proposed to adopt you.\u201dShe bit her lower lip with her white and neat teeth, looking hurt and pitiful. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so envious that she took your card.\u201cShe had always looked down on you, which was why I said what I said to her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I have been too trusting with others. It was my fault.\u201dWhat could Zhong Yi say to that? From the security footage, it was obvious that Ge Yan knew exactly where to find the business card. How\u2019d she knew if Jiang YaGe hadn\u2019t told her?Had Jiang YaGe admitted to it and apologized, she might still be able to forget her. But now that she has put on the front that she has been wronged\u2026 Zhong Yi had made her own decision.There were tears on Jiang YaGe\u2019s long eyelashes. \u201cDo you not believe me?\u201dZhong Yi closed her eyes for a bit. When she reopened them, her voice had calmed and she said to her, \u201cI\u2019ll trust you this one time.\u201dBut this will also be the last time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His voice became more serious. \u201cYou have already completed the \u2018Snow by the River\u2019?\u201d\u201cSnow by the River\u201d was Xu FangWeng\u2019s most famous painting. Rumor had it that a secret magnate bought it at an auction for $560M. A magnate from Hong Kong wanted to buy it once for $1B but failed.Li WangJin had dropped his work to rush over precisely for this today. He had been working with He Ming for years but something of this magnitude was the very first time.He Ming nodded and said, \u201cIt will be done in the next few days. Do you want it? If not, I am going to sell it to someone else. I have others reaching out to me already.\u201dHe Ming had not only helped Li WangJin transfer his wealth over the years; he had also sold his forged works to others for money as well.Li WangJin sat up. The most he had taken out of the company\u2019s account in the past was only tens of millions, and he had slowly built up the amount. If he wanted $1B all at once\u2026 he wondered if Fang JunRong would agree to it.He recalled how Fang JunRong had been colder and colder to him as of late. And, she had further tried to insert her nephew into the company in the last couple of days. It was obvious that she had already started to move in and tried to take over some control of the company. He made a split-second decision. \u201cOkay. On top of this \u2018Snow by the River\u2019, what else have you got? Let\u2019s make it an even $1.5B.\u201dThe reason he trusted He Ming so much and knew that he wouldn\u2019t betray him was because he has He Ming\u2019s only son in his hand, and He Ming\u2019s son was very important to him. There was a shareholder of the company who wanted to sell some of his stocks recently. Once he got this money, he could buy the stock from the shareholder, then his ownership would way surpass that of Fang JunRong\u2019s.He Ming hesitated for a while and said, \u201cLet me see what I can do.\u201d$1.5B, from what he was told, if all went well, she would not only send him and his son overseas, she would give him $10M on top of that. She was way more generous than Li WangJin. All these years that he had been painting for Li WangJin, he had only made several millions of dollars. Plus\u2026He remembered another friend of his who also used to paint for Li WangJin and he just disappeared like that one day. He Ming didn\u2019t want the same thing happening to him.Hearing that, Li WangJin smiled lightly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will arrange for your son to get into the best school and help send him overseas in the future.\u201dHe Ming lowered his head, his voice filled with gratitude when he said, \u201cThank you so much.\u201dUnder the table, his hands were balled into fists.He looked up suddenly and said, \u201cOh, right. A friend of mine saw a woman that looked a lot like Wang SiEr overseas. He swung by my place a few days ago and recognized her from my pictures.\u201dLi WangJin had taken Wang SiEr\u2019s pictures and had He Ming painted a few of them in the past. There were still a few inside the studio, so He Ming was not unfamiliar with Wang SiEr.Li WangJin\u2019s eyes widened in shock. The muscle of his cheeks twitched a little, making him look somewhat vicious. \u201cAre you serious? How is that possible?\u201d As thought remembering something, he asked, \u201cWhere was she?\u201d\u201cIn Country R.\u201dThat\u2019s right. SiEr has a twin sister. He heard that she had left the country a few years ago. That could very well be her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was, after all, SiEr\u2019s sister. Before she passed away, SiEr missed her the most other than YaGe. He was willing to help her out if she needed any help.He Ming said to him, \u201cShe lives next door to my friend. Things haven\u2019t been going well for her. Words had it that her husband has a lot of debt and cheated on her. She jumped through a lot of hoops to finally divorced him. But she\u2019s quite good looking and single, so she was bullied by the natives a lot.\u201dHaving heard that, Li WangJin got even more worried. He said solemnly, \u201cGive me her address. I will have someone go pick her up.\u201dFor SiEr, perhaps he could keep her sister close to him and look after her some.He Ming handed Li WangJin a piece of paper.Li WangJin took the piece of paper from him and added, \u201cStarting today, each of your paintings will go from $50,000 to $60,000.\u201dHis tone was condescending like he was doing him a favor.\u201cThank you, Boss Li.\u201d***Li WangJin quickly had someone go and bring Wang SiXian, sister of Wang SiEr back. Country R was only a few hours of plane ride from City S. Li WangJin was able to meet up with Wang SiXian the very next dayWang SiXian and Wang SiEr, being twins, looked a lot alike. So much that Li WangJin felt that Wang SiEr had risen from the dead when he met her.When Wang SiXian saw him, tears rolled down her face and she walked up and put her arms around him.Li WangJin felt slightly embarrassed. His first reaction was wanting to push her away, but when her tears fell on his neck, he felt how hot they were. It was like they had fallen directly onto his heart. He didn\u2019t push her away after all, but patted her gently on her back.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You are back. I will protect you for your sister.\u201cYou can think of me like an older brother.\u201d\u201cThank you. Really, thank you so much.\u201d Wang SiXian breathed into his neck and gave him an odd sensation.She told him everything that had happened to her over the years and they were truly tear-jerking stories. Coming from her directly, it was so much worse than how He Ming had mentioned them. Wang SiXian\u2019s ex-husband was not only addicted to gambling and cheated on her, there was also domestic violence. So much that she had two miscarriages.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get a divorce sooner?\u201d Li WangJin blurted out. When Wang SiXian was crying, she looked exactly like her sister, making it impossible for him to pretend he hadn\u2019t seen it.Wang SiXian just bit her lower lips and refused to elaborate on it, as though there were something there that she didn\u2019t want to touch upon.Li WangJin did not pry. He took her to a 3-bedroom house. Lao Suen, the one who drove, has been working for Li WangJin for years. He was very good at keeping secrets, even when it came to keeping them from Fang JunRong. Li WangJin trusted him a lot.He sat in the backseat with Wang SiXian.After they arrived at their destination, Wang SiXian dropped her purse when she was getting out of the car. Her wallet fell out and flipped open when it hit the ground. Li WangJin bent over to pick it up for her and saw the pictures inside her wallet.There was a picture on each side. One of them was young Li WangJin. He was handsome back then in a very intelligent way. He was standing under a tree with his laboratory report in hand.The other one was Wang SiXian and a man. The man looked similar to Li WangJin.Wang SiXian quickly took her purse from Li WangJin and looked away, even her neck was flustered. Whether that was from the weather or something else, nobody knew.\u201cWas that your husband?\u201dWang SiXian\u2019s voice was very soft, \u201c\u2026.. yes.\u201dLi WangJin wasn\u2019t an idiot, and he was especially sharp when it came to stuff like this. The two pictures pointed toward one truth\u2026No wonder. No wonder it had taken her so long to get a divorce.His speculation made him look at her reflexively, his look complicated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Li WangJin returned home, his steps were more relaxed and cheerful than usual. Today, he almost felt that he had travelled back in time to when he was still young. That was a wonderful feeling like he had some nice wine. It was an enveloping and light-headed sensation.As soon as he walked inside, he saw his wife sitting on the couch, leafing through a magazine with their other adopted daughter, Zhong Yi. Even though Zhong Yi had already been there for a few days, she spent most of her time inside her room and never had a strong sense of presence. Most of the time, Li WangJin had forgotten that he has another adopted daughter other than YaGe.\u201cAre you guys looking at a magazine?\u201d He scanned over there and it seemed to be some sort of a fashion magazine.Fang JunRong looked up, the corners of her mouth lifted, and she said to him, \u201cZhong Yi and I are picking out a few dresses that she likes. When the samples arrive, I\u2019ll have her try it on and then custom fit it to her size.\u201dLi WangJin immediately thought of Jiang YaGe. \u201cIs YaGe not home? Did you ask her if she wants any?\u201d He said in a joking tone, \u201cI know you like Zhong Yi better, but they are both our kids, you should be fair to both of them and not play any favoritism.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like Zhong Yi. Probably because Zhong Yi was the cause of Jiang YaGe being embarrassed the first day she was there. Plus, he felt that the closer his wife was to her, the more distant his wife was to him. That made him dislike her even more.Fang JunRong said to herself; oh yeah, you are the last person who should be saying that.The smile on her was still perfect. She said in a very suggestive tone, \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for YaGe.\u201d\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Seeing that she was really going to give YaGe the shorter end of the stick, Li WangJin felt that he needed to step in and do something about it.Fang JunRong said slowly, \u201cI planned to introduce Zhong Yi at XinYun\u2019s birthday banquet. That\u2019s why we need her to dress up nicely.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t YaGe need that too?\u201dFang JunRong chuckled as though she was laughing at how childish he was. The way she looked at him like she was looking at a fool made him feel very uneasy.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? That was the anniversary of her parents\u2019 death. It has only been a year. YaGe should show some respect to her parents. I don\u2019t think it will be appropriate for her to attend the banquet.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want her to be sad at the banquet. Which is why I have decided to have her stay elsewhere that day. I am just trying to be mindful of her feelings.\u201d She took everything that Li WangJin had said before and flung them right back at his face.Li WangJin\u2019s face turned beet red, then from red to green. Except that Fang JunRong used everything that he had said before. If he rebutted it now, he\u2019d be slapping his own face.Instead, all he could do was to squeeze out an awkward smile and said, \u201cOh, yeah, you are right. I have also forgotten. You are so thoughtful.\u201dHe even said to Zhong Yi, \u201cPick all the ones that you like. We can always just buy them all.\u201dHearing his words, Zhong Yi looked up and smiled at him.\u201cThank you, Dad.\u201d She looked back down and continued leafing through the magazine.Li WangJin watched the two of them discussing which style of dresses were pretty and felt that it was very unfortunate for YaGe. Many guests would be here on XinYun\u2019s birthday, and it would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce YaGe. Now he\u2019d have to plan something else in the future.His dampened mood improved when he thought about Wang SiXian again. Now that Wang SiXian was back in the country, she could meet up with YaGe more often and help comfort YaGe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could smell the very subtle hint of perfume on him and figured that he must have already met up with Jiang YaGe\u2019s aunt, Wang SiXian. She was the one who had planned it after all.The truth was she didn\u2019t even need to do much. All she needed to do was to have someone mention two things in front of Wang SiXian \u2014 \u201cLi WangJin\u2019s white moonlight was Wang SiEr\u201d and \u201cLi WangJin\u2019s relationship with his wife had gotten worse\u201d.Had she not asked for it, He Ming wouldn\u2019t have brought up Wang SiXian randomly.As for Wang SiXian herself, she was going through a rough patch overseas. Once she heard of this life-saving straw, no way she\u2019d like it slipped by. After all, didn\u2019t she use her looks and pretend to be infatuated to get to Li WangJin in her previous life?Fang JunRong suppressed her sense of disgust that was bubbling up and asked in a nonchalant tone, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLi WangJin paused for a little but, then he quickly put on his normal, gentle smile. \u201cHow much money do we have on the books that we can spend right now?\u201d\u201cOh, probably $7B ~ $8B,\u201d said Fang JunRong. There would have been more, but she had been actively purchasing gold and jewelries etc. lately and used up some of them.Li WangJin frowned a little. That\u2019s less than he had expected. He thought there would be at least over $10B.\u201cYou wanted to buy more antiques and paintings? Haven\u2019t you bought a lot this year already? They must add up to at least tens of billions by now,\u201d said Fang JunRong.Li WangJin\u2019s heart dropped a little. He didn\u2019t think Fang JunRong would pay attention to that. After his face froze up for a while, he recovered quickly and said, \u201cMost of my collection were those by Xu FangWeng. His artworks\u2019 value has only been going up and up internationally as of late. It\u2019s really a kind of investment. When we sell them later, we\u2019d make more than we\u2019d otherwise on the stock market.He said it with such righteousness as though he was merely making money for their family.\u201cYou have heard of \u2018Snow by the River\u201d by Xu FangWeng, right? I have already gotten hold of the original buyer. He needs cash for his family business and has the intention to sell it. He has a few other well-known paintings that he was interested in parting with as well. They add up to about $1.5B. It\u2019s not a small amount so I wanted to talk to you first.\u201dIf it was just tens of millions, then he wouldn\u2019t bother talking to her about, but this was a large amount. He\u2019d need her approval first.Fang JunRong just wanted to laugh out loud. She looked down and said, \u201cYou know, we can\u2019t just spend all the cash that we have. We should at least save some for future investments, like if we want to bid for land for development.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Li WangJin had already had it all thought out before he approached Fang JunRong. \u201cI figured that our company has its own investments in the stock market as well. We can sell some of the stocks owned by the company for cash. Then we only need to add in a little bit more cash from the company.\u201dOf course, that was a great idea to Fang JunRong. If they don\u2019t sell them, they\u2019d have to split them 50/50 during their divorce. If they sell them now, the money would end up hers. It\u2019s a win-win for her. As much as she loved the idea, she put on a frown and a concerned look.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of risk. I don\u2019t think we should do that.\u201d She shook her head and looked very determined.Li WangJin continued to try and convince her and brought up every point that he could think of. Finally, he promised that he\u2019d take out an additional $500 million to buy some properties before Fang JunRong \u201creluctantly\u201d agreed.When Fang JunRong finally nodded, Li WangJin was exhausted. He would only comfort himself by thinking that even though his wife got $500 million, he\u2019d have made $1.5B. Anyway one looked at it, he was the one who came out ahead.He didn\u2019t want to drag it out in case Fang JunRong changed her mind and went to arrange for a transaction as soon as he had obtained Fang JunRong\u2019s approval.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Plus, since the Li\u2019s wanted to sell quite a few of them; most in the circle had caught wind of it. In addition, Fang JunRong had no intention of keeping this a secret for Li WangJin. It didn\u2019t take long for many to find out that Li WangJin had gone insane over Xu FangWeng\u2019s work and were selling quite a few of their money-making stocks.In front of him, they praised that he has good taste and money wasn\u2019t an object to him. But inevitably, they would mock him behind his back. Every plutocrat has a few hobbies, and naturally, some of them cost more money than others. But none of them would spend that kind of money like Li WangJin was doing.Of course, many of them also felt that Fang JunRong had been way too nice to Li WangJin for putting up with that type of spending habits. If it were them, they\u2019d at least try to stop him. As such, Fang JunRong had also become the image of an amazing Chinese wife in many people\u2019s eyes.A few of Fang JunRong\u2019s closer friends even called her up and reminded her that she must keep some control of the money at home and not let just her man spend it however he wanted.To which Fang JunRong would always reply with a tolerating \u201coh, whatever makes him happy\u201d to further make herself stand out. Of course, she did all of these things on purpose. Once they get a divorce, Li WangJin would not be able to even dream about having the public opinions on his side like before.Li WangJin had no idea that Fang JunRong was setting him up subtly. He sold a portion of their stocks and was quite happy after he had the money in hand. He transferred $1.5B to He Ming. Now, all he needed to do was to wait for He Ming to transfer them back to him.Even though he had already worked with He Ming for many years, he still didn\u2019t trust him 100%. He had a few of his men watching over He Ming. He hadn\u2019t expected that all of the hired men would return with bruises on their faces and looking anxious.Li WangJin had a bad feeling. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d\u201cHe Ming is gone!\u201dHis blood roiled and Li WangJin almost fell down on the ground. He took a deep breath, and his veins were visible on his forehead. \u201cWhat good are you all? There are so many of you. How did he run away by himself?\u201dThe hired men felt very unjust. \u201cHe Ming got himself a bunch of accomplices. They beat us up, and he was already gone by the time we regained consciousness.\u201dLi WangJin was about to have a heart attack when he thought about his $1.5B. His finger that was pointing at the hired men shook violently ,and he finally made out some words after a long while. \u201cGo look for him! Keep looking! Even if you have to dig 3 feet down you are going to find him!\u201dIf he didn\u2019t still need them to do his dirty work for him, Li WangJin would have beat up all these useless losers himself.He was so angry that his eyes were about to turn red thinking about He Ming who had gotten away with such a large amount of money. As rich as the Li\u2019s were, with the net worth in the tens of billions, most of their assets were in real estates. Losing that much cash at once made his heart arched indescribably.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right now, the top priority was to find He Ming and get the money back. He was a little baffled. Did He Ming decide to give up on his son? He knew that He Ming had some sort of health issue when he was young. The son that he has in custody was no doubt He Ming\u2019s only child. Li WangJin had hid him well and He Ming had never seen him. At most, he could see his son on video chat.He felt unsettled the entire time and another possibility occurred to him. He fished out his cellphone nervously and made a call.Five minutes later, after he had hung up, he was so angry that he smashed his phone.Sure enough. He Ming\u2019s son was gone too. Someone had taken him.Someone was helping out He Ming!He was angry, but also anxious at the same time. Who did this? They not only knew about He Ming; they also knew where He Ming\u2019s son was. Li WangJin had always been careful. Only three of his most trusted men knew about this.Could one of the three men have betrayed him? Once that idea had formed in his mind, he couldn\u2019t shake it off. He tried hard to recall the behaviors of all three of them recently and tried to see if he could think of anything. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it could be any of the three. One or more of them might be in cahoots with He Ming. He could be surrounded by danger. Cold cold sweat began to drip from his body.Li WangJin, in a foul mood, wanted to go somewhere to relax. But, he had just smashed his own cellphone and the screen was in pieces and inoperable. He couldn\u2019t even call in advance to visit one of his usual clubs nor was he in the habit of having multiple cellphones normally.Li WangJin, who was running into issues in every direction, finally retrieved the SIM card from the now-destroyed cellphone and had his chauffeur take him to Wang SiXian\u2019s place.He borrowed his chauffeur\u2019s phone on his way and inserted his SIM card inside. He called Wang SiXian on that phone and asked her out to dinner. Hearing Wang SiXian\u2019s gentle voice from the other end made him feel better.After years of very peaceful life, the sudden appearance of Wang SiXian made him feel like he had rediscovered some of his youthful passion.After he had chatted with her for a little bit and hung up the phone, Li WangJin saw a text. The name of the sender made his face drop.The text came from He Ming.He had the balls to send him a message?!Li WangJin was so angry that his chest was heaving up and down. He quickly clicked open the text message, and his blood boiled all over again after he read it.He Ming was blackmailing him for another $2B. Otherwise, he\u2019d exposed everything that they had done together in the past. He had been keeping all the emails between the two of them over the years, and he also has recordings to some of their conversations.Li WangJin was so angry that he smashed the cellphone again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How dare He Ming still have the balls to blackmail him after he had run away?Was he not worried that he\u2019d just take him to court?That very moment, Li WangJin had a strong desire to go to the cops, except he quickly suppressed his desire. He had sadly come to the realization that he wouldn\u2019t dare to do that. Had he done that, the whole thing would blow up and his reputation would truly be ruined. For someone like him, there was nothing he worried more than losing face.The amount that He Ming was blackmailing him for wasn\u2019t worth him taking that risk, even though that would mean that he\u2019d lose half of the amount that he had transferred over the last ten years. He Ming was, after all, someone that he had worked for over ten years. He knew him only too well.Li WangJin had always thought that having He Ming\u2019s son in his hand and arranging a few people to watch over He Ming was sufficient. After all, Li WangJin had always perceived himself as being above He Ming. Never would he have expected that the man he had looked down upon would turn around and set up him instead.Li WangJin breathed heavily. His veins propped up on the back of his hands like poisonous snakes.One of these days, he\u2019d get back at He Ming. There was no way He Ming could remain hidden forever.His eyes were filled with distress.The chauffeur accidentally looked in the rearview mirror and saw his look. He was startled and even his driving speed slowed down.After Li WangJin got out of the car, he had already recollected himself. He wanted to still be that gentleman in front of Wang SiXian. He bought a new phone for himself before he reached the restaurant and also one for his chauffeur.As much as he tried to hide his emotions, Wang SiXian had still picked up a little of it. Her tone was even more gentle and tender. It blew away some of the dark emotions inside Li WangJin.Li WangJin was glad that he had brought Wang SiXian back. If he was in front of his wife right now, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would still be able to keep everything under wrap.The atmosphere between them became more suggestive over the meal. Wang SiXian told him softly what had happened since she had returned to the country, and Li WangJin also brought up Jiang YaGe and expressed that he would bring Jiang YaGe with him to visit her in the next few days so the two of them could reunite.As they were chatting, their heads got closer and closer together. Of course, Li WangJin was completely oblivious to that. He just felt that Wang SiXian was a very thoughtful person and everything she said made him feel good.\u201cBoss Li,\u201d came a somewhat familiar male voice.Li WangJin turned around and looked over in the voice\u2019s direction and saw a middle-aged man in full suit. He quickly realized that it was Boss Su, a man who he has a business relationship with.He reflexively pulled away from Wang SiXian a bit as he nodded slightly to greet the man. \u201cBoss Su.\u201dBoss Su walked over in front of him. He gave Wang SiXian a few looks and with a suggestive smile, he said, \u201cSo that\u2019s what you like, Boss Li.\u201dWang SiXian didn\u2019t know what to say, so she lowered her head.Li WangJin wanted to explain. \u201cNo, she\u2019s just a good friend of mine.\u201dBoss Su winked at him. \u201cI get it. I have a few good friends like that as well.\u201d He chatted a bit with Li WangJin regarding their businesses and was about to leave. Before leaving, he took another look at Wang SiXian and said, \u201cBoss Li, it\u2019s normal for people like us to have good friends like that, but you must remember that the most important thing is still your wife at home.\u201cNot to mention that Boss Fong has always been so nice to you. Just look, how many others would be like her and let you spend billions on your hobby without saying a word. It wouldn\u2019t be right to wrong her.\u201cBesides, outside women are only there for your money. Don\u2019t be too serious about it.\u201d He glanced over at Wang SiXian as he was talking. Wang SiXian was so upset at his words that her eyes had reddened.Boss Su only reminded Li WangJin because he could tell from the way that Li WangJin was interacting with the woman that he was a bit serious there. He couldn\u2019t care less about how the woman felt.Li WangJin\u2019s face turned green right away \u2013 how was it that everyone knew how much he had been spending on antiques and paintings?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did, however, snicker to himself; his wife had been singing Li WangJin\u2019s praises at home on a regular basis. About how he was very faithful to his wife and never had another woman on the side. Judging from what he was seeing now, Li WangJin was just better at hiding, that\u2019s all.He has other women as well, but at least he never thought he\u2019d leave his wife for them. Li WangJin didn\u2019t seem to understand even that basic concept.The interruption from Boss Su put Li WangJin\u2019s mood back in the valley. He quickly took Wang SiXian back to her place and took off. Normally, he would spend a lot of time comforting her when he saw that Wang SiXian was down, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood right now.***Fang JunRong looked at her additional $3 billion in her bank card and was exceptionally happy. Thinking about how Li WangJin had tried so hard in transferring and stashing away their assets and over half of them now ended up in her hands, the happiness that was built upon Li WangJin\u2019s suffering increased exponentially.She was right about him. When blackmailed, Li WangJin finally paid He Ming $2 billion to keep his mouth shut. But, he had also expressed that should He Ming tried to blackmail him again, then no matter what the consequences would be, he\u2019d sue him and send him to jail.The money finally ended in Fang JunRong\u2019s hands. Fang JunRong paid He Ming $1 billion in return for his help. She had never shown her face the entire time. Everything went through her good friend Xu WeiWei, so He Ming had no idea who he was in cohorts with. After he received his share, he settled down overseas anonymously.She had no intention to go after He Ming. This entire time, He Ming was but a little pawn in the whole event. Plus, He Ming wasn\u2019t a low-key person. He couldn\u2019t help but be high-spirited after he had received the money. Who knew what would happen if he didn\u2019t remain low-key?Now that Wang SiXian was back in the country, Fang JunRong was able to collect even more evidence. Ironically, Li WangJin seemed to have forgotten that all their properties were under her name and had Wang SiXian settled in one of their houses. He had that much faith in her trust for him?As the owner of the house, naturally Fang JunRong has the key to every property. She took the opportunity when Wang SiXian was out and had someone install spy cams inside \u2013 bedrooms, living room, etc \u2013 covering every corner of the house.She put her cellphone away and planned to go out for her afternoon tea.Li XinYun just got home and gave Fang JunRong a bright smile as soon as she saw her. \u201cMom! Are you going out?\u201dFang JunRong nodded. \u201cYes, I am going to dinner with Su Mei of Hengyuan Corporation.\u201dLi XinYun had always been around Fang JunRong and knew pretty much everyone in the circle. Her delicate brows frowned a little and she said, \u201cThat Aunty Sun? I thought you weren\u2019t too fond of her?\u201dFang JunRong nodded. \u201cWe are not, but she asked me out and I can\u2019t very well just turn her down.\u201d Even though Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t very fond of Sun Mei, she played a critical role in Fang JunRong\u2019s plans.That made sense to Li XinYun. She lamented, \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be an adult.\u201d Then she changed the subject and said excitedly, \u201cMom, do you have any more of those Beautify Pills? They were so effective. I feel that my skin has become much better after I have had them.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s laboratory reports have come back. When she found out that the Beautify Pills were harmless to her, she gave some of them to her daughter. Taking a closer look now, even though XunYun\u2019s skin had always been good, now they looked visibly better.Her skin was like amber \u2013 no pores could be seen and looked to be glowing under the sun.She smiled and said, \u201cI have already placed a box on your table. Don\u2019t forget to take them. One a day will be sufficient.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Li XinYun was immediately distracted by the Beautify Pills and couldn\u2019t wait to go upstairs.Fang JunRong smiled, looked away from her daughter, and left to meet up with Sun Mei.She was going to meet up with Sun Mei at a western food restaurant. Words had it that Sun Mei grew up overseas and prefers western food to Chinese food.Su Mei married her husband for family alliances. It was obvious that Sun Mei was quite fond of her husband, but her husband didn\u2019t seem to have much feelings toward her. He had affairs with actresses all the time and was very open about them, not caring to even put up a front.It was just last week when Fang JunRong read on the web how Boss Su had spent a large amount of money to celebrate the birthday of an actress. Li WangJin, on the other hand, had a very good reputation in the circle and also held himself as the good man with no scandals. The stark contrast made Sun Mei unhappy with Fang JunRong, and Fang JunRong also never got along that well with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was in a dark red dress and wearing a lot of jewelry. Wealthy looking? Yes. But that didn\u2019t hide her age well. She was about the same age as Fang JunRong but even her heavy foundation couldn\u2019t cover up her crow\u2019s feet.Fang JunRong sat down across from her and smiled. \u201cSorry I was a little late. I chatted with my daughter for a little bit just when I was on my way out.\u201dSun Mei\u2019s look inevitably stopped on Fang JunRong\u2019s face and her face sank. How was it that Fang JunRong was looking younger and younger? Time has treated her so well that it didn\u2019t leave much marks on her. Unlike herself, no amount of facial could stop the changes brought about by the aging process.She was so envious of her, but she still pretended to ask her nonchalantly, \u201cWhat kind of foundation are you using? Your makeup seems so natural.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot today that I didn\u2019t put on any makeup. I figured it\u2019d be okay as we have been friends for so long.\u201d She stroked her own face and said, \u201cAh well, guess I am just pretty naturally.\u201dSun Mei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe was so angry! But she still needed to maintain her smiling face.Remembering the reason that she asked Fang JunRong out, she was finally able to suppress her roiling jealousy. She squinted her eyes and with a smile that was obviously happy about Fang JunRong\u2019s misfortune, she said, \u201cOh, well, as much as we take care of ourselves, we aren\u2019t spring chicks anymore. We must be understanding about why men always like the younger ones.\u201dFang JunRong frowned slightly and said, \u201cAre you talking about your husband? I am not worried about my WangJin. He\u2019s not that kind of a person.\u201d\u201cI have already grown used to mine. I am talking about your husband, Li WangJin. I am only letting you know because we are friends. Let me tell you, Li WangJin is having an affair. Look. I even have photos!\u201d said Sun Mei.She turned on her cellphone and showed Fang JunRong one picture after another, not missing any bit of changes on Fang JunRong\u2019s face. These were pictures that her husband had taken and sent to her. She was very unhappy that Fang JunRong showed no signs of anger or jealousy. Nothing that would make her feel satisfying.\u201cDo you not believe me? You have too much faith in him. You even let him spend billions of dollars. Who knew that he was keeping women outside with that kind of money?\u201dFang JunRong shook her head. \u201cI trust WangJin. He would never wrong me. Everybody has a few friends of the opposite gender. There\u2019s no need for you to instigate here.\u201dShe looked over at Sun Mei and said in the most righteous tone, \u201cI know you are not happy in your relationship, which is why you wish ill will upon others. I won\u2019t fall for that.\u201dSun Mei was so angry that she almost flipped over the table. She gave Fang JunRong a vicious stare and said, \u201cI only have your best interest in mind! Wait until I have more evidence. Let\u2019s see what you have to say then!\u201dHaving said that, she grabbed her purse and walked out.Looking at her back, Fang JunRong\u2019s lips curved up \u2013 what a nice and helpful person that Sun Mei was! When she had collected more evidence, she\u2019d make sure Sun Mei gets a copy of them!After all, she would need a blabber mouth like Sun Mei to advertise about Li WangJin\u2019s behavior. During this lifetime, Li WangJin would no longer be that righteous and innocent man like he was in her past life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everybody was pleased when she was sent to the mental institution at the end and that Li WangJin was practically a saint for not doing more to her.Back then, they had pretended so well that they were able to fool everyone. Well, okay, maybe not everyone was necessarily fooled. Back then, Li WangJin and Li ShiZe\u2019s assets had increased by several folds. They had taken the #1 and #3 places on the top wealthiest list and a lot of power that came with that. Nobody would want to risk offending the two of them by defending Fang JunRong. During this lifetime, not only did she want to reclaim what was hers, but she also wanted to tear off that fake facade of theirs.She ordered a few small plates of food, enjoyed them slowly, and also ordered some take out that her daughter liked to take with her.When she arrived at home, Li WangJin had already come back. Sitting on the couch, his hair stuck together from his sweat. There was a sense of distress surrounding him. His usual scholarly elegance was goone. When he looked up suddenly, his eyes looked like that of a beast who wanted to tear a person apart. There were dark clouds inside his eyes, and his voice was filled with accusation. \u201cYou told everyone that I was buying paintings?\u201dEveryone in their circle knew about it, and many of them mocked how stupid and wasteful he was behind his back. Other than that Boss Su, many others called him up and sang Fang JunRong\u2019s praises to him. All the compliments for Fang JunRong made Li WangJin feel like he had just swallowed a fly \u2013 his stomach roiled with disgust. He had worked so hard and lost so much money on it, and all that came out of it was improving his wife\u2019s reputation? How could he not want to puke blood?Fang JunRong chuckled slightly and responded in a casual way, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was something that needed to be kept on the down low. Why can\u2019t I share that?\u201dLi WangJin immediately responded anxiously, \u201cYou have no idea what they said about me behind my back.\u201dFang JunRong put on a more serious look and said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s better to tell them the truth rather than them speculating about what was going on. Many thought that your selling so much stocks in a hurry was because our company was cash-strapped. A few of our contracted companies wanted to back out of the contracts. I had to explain it to them.\u201dLi WangJin was suddenly speechless. That had not occurred to him.Fang JunRong carried on, \u201cSome of them even whispered to me that you were cashing out so much because you are having an affair. I can\u2019t possibly let them think that of you, so I had no choice but to clarify it.\u201cSun Mei even told me today that she saw you having lunch with a woman and the two of you looked quite intimate. Was that true?\u201d She looked directly at Li WangJin as she said that.Under her stare, Li WangJin felt that he was standing stark naked under the sun, and there was nowhere to hide. The only thing that was in his mind was Wang SiXian\u2019s tender and affectionate look. He shook his head to shake off the image \u2013 no, there was nothing going on between the two of them. He was only extending the olive branch to Wang SiXian because of Wang SiEr.He said in a righteous tone, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hang out with that gossiping Sun Mei. She never felt happy about how loving the two of us are.\u201dHe paused, then explained himself. \u201cShe\u2019s YaGe\u2019s aunt. She was down on her luck and had recently returned to the country. I only met up with her to talk to her about YaGe and wanted her to spend some time with YaGe and help her feel better. You know, YaGe had been depressed ever since her parents passed away.\u201dFang JunRong only wanted to snicker. Li WangJin made Jiang YaGe sound like such a filial person. If she missed her parents so much, then she shouldn\u2019t be spending all the time being intimate with Li ShiZe. She was always making soup for him or picking up his room for him. Several of the servants at home had already mentioned this to her. The two of them had been so intimate that they had started crossing the line.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang YaGe turned around and ran and cried to Li WangJin and Li ShiZe. Suddenly, Fang JunRong had turned into the villainess elder who was slandering her.During this lifetime, Jiang YaGe and Li ShiZe could do whatever they wanted. It didn\u2019t concern her whatsoever.She had no interest in talking about Jiang YaGe and changed the subject. \u201cOh, by the way. When will the painting arrive? I remembered that we have already made the payment. I would love to appreciate Master Xu\u2019s great work as well.\u201dLi WangJin froze in his spot. He Ming had already run off with the money. He didn\u2019t leave any painting behind. Where was he supposed to find a \u201cSnow by the River\u201d from? He wouldn\u2019t even be able to find another person to paint it for him with such short notice either. He didn\u2019t want words to get out nor would he be able to immediately find another artist was an expert in counterfeit.His lips quivered, and he wasn\u2019t able to come up with anything after a long while.Fang JunRong casted him a glance and asked, \u201cDid something happen? Did the seller back out of the deal?\u201dHow could Li WangJin possibly tell her the truth? He could only grit his teeth and said, \u201cYes, his money freed up and he backed out of it.\u201dHe suddenly realized sadly that he would need to cough out whatever money left that he shored away for himself to fill the hole. Li WangJin was at loss all of a sudden. Did that mean his efforts over the years were all for nothing?He felt particularly depressed and frustrated. His recent setback made him age a lot all of a sudden. He walked up the stairs weakly; his back looked dreary.Naturally, Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t going to feel bad for him. She returned to her own room cheerfully and eagerly wished that Li WangJin would go and seek comfort from Wang SiXian more often to allow her to collect more definitive evidence. She couldn\u2019t tolerate being under the same roof with him for much longer.Her good mood didn\u2019t last very long. As soon as Fang JunRong walked inside her room, she noticed that her safe had been tampered with.She had already emptied her safe out of all of her deeds and jewelries and moved them into her dimension, leaving just an empty shell in her bedroom. She tied a red knot on her safe \u2013 this knot was knitted by her daughter. It was crooked but it was the thought that counted, which was why Fang JunRong accepted it.And now the knot was facing a different direction, indicating that her safe had been tampered with.Fang JunRong did not have surveillance installed in her room, so she had no idea who was inside of her room. But she had some ideas \u2013 either Li ShiZe or Jiang YaGe. The odds of it being Li ShiZe was higher as he was the one who knew her passcode.Her jade bracelet was stolen by her BBQ-pork son in her previous life and gifted to Jiang YaGe.What Fang JunRong was even more curious about was how did Jiang YaGe know about the secret of the bracelet when she didn\u2019t even know about it herself? To a point that she would go above and beyond to get her hands on it. When she read the novel, that was only mentioned in passing as if everything was but a coincidence. But she wasn\u2019t one who believed in coincidences.Now that Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t able to get a hold of the bracelet, there would probably be a round two.Fang JunRong reflexively toyed with the barely visible mark of the bracelet around her wrist.***Jiang YaGe looked at the tall and handsome Li ShiZe with anticipation. She must admit that she has certain fondness towards him. He was the second nicest person to her after Uncle Li.\u201cShiZe.\u201dLi ShiZe\u2019s usual cold look softened up when he saw Jiang YaGe without him even noticing it. He wasn\u2019t too fond of her originally when he found out where she had once worked. That was, until he had inadvertently found out she only worked there to help out a friend who was in dire need for money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of that, even when she was misunderstood by others, she never explained herself in order to help her friend keep her secret.Li ShiZe had met many women ever since he was a child, but he had never met one like Jiang YaGe who looked weak on the outside but was very stubborn and resilient on the inside. Plus, his mother and sister obviously disliked Jiang YaGe and always bullied her around the house. He couldn\u2019t help but be even nice to her as he felt bad for her.Of course, he also placed the blame on Zhong Yi. If Zhong Yi hadn\u2019t been badmouthing YaGe constantly in front of his mother and sister, they certainly would not have such a bad impression of her.As much as he had thought about, he maintained his image of being a man of few words. He only talked more in front of those he cared about.\u201cYaGe.\u201dJiang YaGe looked at Li ShiZe with her limpid eyes. Her eyes were the best of all her features. They looked like they could talk. The way she looked at one hinted at romance and suggestiveness. Her eyes were also what made her go from an above-average looking woman to a pretty woman.Li ShiZe said to her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My mom stashed her bracelet somewhere else and I couldn\u2019t find it.\u201dLi ShiZe saw Jiang YaGe crying one day and found out that she had lost her bracelet. The bracelet didn\u2019t belong to her, but it was a gift from her parents\u2019 good friend. When she was one, she was betrothed to that family and the bracelet was given to her family as the betrothal gift. They were to return the bracelet if the two kids were not suitable for each other.The little fires in Jiang YaGe\u2019s eyes died off. \u201cI have no feelings for him and didn\u2019t want to marry him. But I wasn\u2019t able to return the bracelet to them.\u201dLi ShiZe said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will look for it some more and maybe see if we can buy a similar one? That shouldn\u2019t be a problem when money is not an object.\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s eyes were slightly red. \u201cNo, I have never seen one liked that elsewhere, except for Mom\u2019s. There was a section in the middle that was so green, it was almost transparent and looked almost like the shape of a mountain.\u201dLi ShiZe wasn\u2019t surprised that Jiang YaGe knew of his mother\u2019s bracelet. She probably had seen his mom wear it in the past. He tried to comfort her by saying that, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. When push comes to shove, I will just give you my mom\u2019s. Betrothals like that are not legally binding at this day and age.\u201d Li ShiZe didn\u2019t feel that it was a big deal to take his mom\u2019s bracelet. What belonged to his parents would become his sooner or later. He was just getting it sooner was all.He was reluctant to see YeGe marrying someone against her wish over something so silly. Except that he would need to avoid mentioning YaGe when he asked his mom for her bracelet. He worried that his mom would turn him down if she knew that YaGe had anything to do with it.Jiang YaGe finally smiled after she heard him say that. \u201cThank you. I am glad I have you on my side.\u201dLi ShiZe curved his lips, and his look became much gentler. He was cold and handsome. When he smiled occasionally, it was like ice melting. Jiang YaGe was charmed by the smile. Her cheeks blushed, and she looked at him amorously with trust and happiness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps, because it had already been a while since her rebirth, she could now suppress her seeping hatred much better now and was able to talk to him in a mild and tender tone.\u201cWhat is it? I heard you have been interning at work. Is it tiring? If it\u2019s too tiring, then take some time off. Your health is the most important.\u201d She put up the perfect loving mother front, appearing just like she used to be.Li ShiZe immediately let out a sigh of relief from the way she looked. He wasn\u2019t someone that had no EQ. He did not jump straight into the topic of the bracelet. Rather, he started talking about Li XinYun\u2019s birthday banquet that was upcoming in a few weeks. He looked like a brother who was distant in appearance but actually cared a lot about his sister.Nevertheless, Fang JunRong wouldn\u2019t be fooled again. Li ShiZe had been very nice to both her and her daughter before Jiang YaGe\u2019s arrival. But once he was in love with Jiang YaGe, the only thing that was left inside of him was his love for her, he had no more affection left for his family. How else would he be able to send his mother to the mental institution and watch coldly when his own sister became the plaything of someone else and finally ended up committing suicide?Li ShiZe spent about 15 minutes or so chitchatting before he moved onto his real purpose.\u201cDid Mom used to have a very pretty jade bracelet? How come I haven\u2019t seen you wearing it for a while?\u201dFang JunRong, who had been anticipating this, wasn\u2019t surprised by it at all. She casually said, \u201cI have quite a few jade bracelets. Which one are you talking about?\u201d She had no shortage of jewelry.Li ShiZe said, \u201cThe bright green one with a pattern that resembles a mountain.\u201d If his mother barely ever worn it, it must not be something very important. She most likely wouldn\u2019t object too much if he was to ask her for it.Fang JunRong gave a pondering look for a while before she seemingly suddenly realized which one he was referring to. \u201cOh, that bracelet\u2026\u201d She paused for a while and kept the suspense for as long as possible before she slowly said, \u201cI took it with me when I went on a trip with some friends and lost it. I wasn\u2019t able to find it again.\u201d\u201cI have a few more bracelets, some even better than that one. Why don\u2019t you pick a different one?\u201dAs the heir of the Li\u2019s, Li ShiZe was in no shortage of money and never cared too much about jewellery. He wouldn\u2019t have come to ask his mother for it if it wasn\u2019t for Jiang YaGe. Hearing her words, he couldn\u2019t help but frown and his volume went up. \u201cYou lost it? How did that happen?\u201dFang JunRong sighed and said, \u201cI am not sure. I only realized it when I was unpacking after the trip. Why do you ask about it all of a sudden?\u201dLi ShiZe tightened his lips a bit and made up some random reasons. \u201cI like it a lot and thought it\u2019d go with an outfit.\u201dAll he could think of was Jiang YaGe\u2019s crying face once she found out that the bracelet was lost. He felt very frustrated. Once she found out about it, she would for sure hide under the blanket and cry again.As the formidable heir of the Li\u2019s, he couldn\u2019t so much as protect the smile of a girl.He felt a budding disgruntledness inside of him. Why did his mom need to take the bracelet with her on a trip? Now he\u2019d have to go and see if he\u2019d be able to find a similar one elsewhere.As he was feeling irritated, he didn\u2019t stay to chat more but quickly looked for an excuse and left. He was still thinking about where and how he could find a suitable bracelet.Fang JunRong grumbled to herself. It was lucky that she no longer had any feelings toward her BBQ-Pork son; otherwise, how hurt would she be seeing him being so BBQ-pork like?She also started pondering about maybe having someone make a duplicate of it, so she could set up Jiang YaGe and Li ShiZe.But could you really set up a slab of BBQ pork?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In her dreams, there was a bright green bracelet around Fang JunRong\u2019s slender and white wrist. Normally speaking, dreams would only be in black and white, but the bracelet sparkled a brightness that could not be overlooked.Once she touched the bracelet, she would go inside a whole different world. She was only able to see a large stone tablet and fairyland-looking mountain, but Jiang YaGe could tell that it was no regular place. She still felt very at loss after she had woken up. There was a strong feeling within her that was telling her that she must get her hands on that bracelet.She assumed it was nothing more than just a dream at the beginning. But after having the same dream for the entire week on end, she finally asked the servants at the Li\u2019s in private. Jiang YaGe had been very nice to these servants normally. She took pity on them, even when she found out that they had pilfered a bit here and there, she would just look the other way. She was very well liked among the servants. Thanks to them, Jiang YaGe was able to find out that Fang JunRong had that exact bracelet. She used to wear it a lot but had it put away in recent years.In Jiang YaGe\u2019s mind, her dreams were heaven\u2019s way of telling her to seize her opportunity. She felt this burning desire inside of her that she must have that bracelet.From her perspective, yes that was Fang JunRong\u2019s bracelet, but one couldn\u2019t possibly compare a magical artifact with a regular piece of jewelry. A magical artifact possessed the ability to pick its rightful owner. So, she didn\u2019t feel bad plotting after the bracelet. After all, the bracelet was nothing more than just a regular piece of jewelry in Fang JunRong\u2019s hands. If she could truly utilize the bracelet for any gains, she could also be helpful to Fang JunRong in return.That was the reason that she had made up a reason and created a nonexistent fianc\u00e9 to have Li ShiZe willingly help her get her hands on the bracelet. That was supposed to be cut and dry, but to her dismay, the bracelet was lost.The news made her turn pale and filled with disbelief. Her teary eyes looked like lakes. \u201cAre you certain of that?\u201dHer look made Li ShiZe felt awful. He nodded and said, \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s alright. Let me see how we can find another similar one.\u201d He frowned. If push came to shove, he could always threaten the fiance\u2019s family when they came. He figured her fianc\u00e9 was not from any prestigious family and probably wouldn\u2019t dare offend the Li\u2019s.That did not lighten Jiang YaGe\u2019s mood at all. Even if he found an identical bracelet, it still wouldn\u2019t be the one.She lowered her head. \u201cIt was my fault. I never should have lost it.\u201dShe looked like a flower that was beaten up by the rain, looking pitiful and helpless.He wanted to be even nicer to Jiang YaGe. Li ShiZe\u2019s heart ached for her and was even more upset at Zhong Yi. He even suspected that Zhong Yi had something to do with it being lost.Jiang YaGe looked up and met his eyes. Then, as though she had come across something that was burning hot, she quickly looked away.After the entire day of interaction between the two, even though their relationship did not move forward, they could feel the slight hint of romance had budded between them.___Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was surrounded by a sense of gloominess.Li WangJin had always wished that Jiang YaGe was his daughter. Seeing her like that made his heart ached. He thought her sadness was brought on by the proximity to her parents\u2019 death anniversary, so he took her to meet up with Wang SiXian.Jiang YaGe had only met this aunty of hers a few times in the past. Wang SiXian looked exactly the same as her mother Wang SiEr. Seeing her was like seeing her mother who had passed away, Jiang YaGe couldn\u2019t help but started to cry.After she was done crying and the two of them had spent some time together, the two of them had grown much closer to each other. Jiang YaGe looked at her aunt and then at the tender-looking Li WangJin and seemed to have formed an idea.Wang SiXian felt a little uneasy under her gaze. Tugging at her niece\u2019s sleeve, she said kindly, \u201cMy sister had always objected to my marriage with your ex-uncle-in-law and that had driven a wedge between us, causing us to have fallen out of touch with each other.\u201cHad WangJin not told me, I didn\u2019t even know that my sister had passed away. I didn\u2019t even get to see her one last time.\u201d There was a slight hint of sadness and regret on her.Li WangJin knew the reason why Wang SiXian insisted on marrying that scum and felt awkward all of a sudden. He looked for some excuse to take off early and left the two of them to spend more time with each other.Jiang YaGe\u2019s look dimmed as well. \u201cMom missed you the entire time.\u201d The two of them thought about Wang SiEr, who had died in a tragic accident. After a while, Jiang YaGe asked softly, \u201cAre you fond of my adopted father, Aunty?\u201dWang SiXian blushed and said, \u201cSuch nonsense. He is married.\u201dJiang YaGe said softly to her, \u201cMy adopted dad and mom have been having issues. The two of them fight a lot at home, especially after I have joined them. My adopted mom didn\u2019t seem to like me much.\u201dJiang YaGe wasn\u2019t an idiot. Naturally, she could tell that Fang JunRong was nicer to Zhong Yi than she was to her. Thinking about her own mother and the way her adopted father treated her and the occasional words that he had said, she had a pretty good idea. If only her mom had picked her adopted father back in the days, then she\u2019d be her adopted dad\u2019s real daughter and that would be her home. She wouldn\u2019t need to walk on thin ice all the time. She couldn\u2019t believe someone as nice as her adopted father would end up marrying someone like her adopted mother. What a bummer.She looked up at her aunty \u2013 her aunty looked exactly like her mom, especially when she smiled. They could be the same person.\u201cEven if his relationship with Fang JunRong is rocky, they are still legally wedded to each other. I shouldn\u2019t spend too much time around him. We wouldn\u2019t want any misunderstandings if we were seen together,\u201d said Wang SiXian.Ever since they ran into Li WangJin\u2019s friend last time, he hasn\u2019t been taking her out much, until today when he brought Jiang YaGe with him.Jiang YaGe blurted out, \u201cBut Aunty can spend more time with me. Nobody would misunderstand anything if I am there as well.\u201dMore importantly, not even her adopted mother could say much if she found out. After all, wasn\u2019t it normal for her to visit her own aunt?Wang SiXian thought about it for a while and affectionately brushed her niece\u2019s hair behind her ears. \u201cI don\u2019t have a daughter, but now I have you. It is just as good as having a daughter of my own.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the past, she\u2019d go into work mode and see if she could nail down a few contracts for the company during these banquets, but now\u2026She had no interest in the company that was taken over by Li WangJin\u2019s men. She didn\u2019t care if it went out of business, as long as it didn\u2019t happen until after her divorce. As such, she laid back in a corner and leisurely enjoyed the o\u2019deurs at the banquet, even commenting on them from time to time.In the past, Li WangJin didn\u2019t care for his wife\u2019s persistently meddling in the company\u2019s business when she could just be a stay-at-home pampered wife. But now that he saw her being completely disengaged, he was slightly displeased.A few new policies had been rolled out this year, and the company had a hard time keeping up with them. The company had suffered a minor setback this quarter. A few influential Second Generation Richs were also here at this banquet. Fang JunRong went to high school with a couple of them and has decent relationships with them. He brought Fang JunRong with him today because he hoped that she\u2019d be able to get some information from her old classmates.He chatted with a few other CEOs and finally couldn\u2019t help but walk over to Fang JunRong. He put on a gentle smile. As though he worried about startling her, his voice was as tender as it could be. \u201cJunRong, I saw a couple of your old friends over there. Don\u2019t you want to go chat with them?\u201dFang JunRong looked over in the direction that he had indicated. Surrounded by a group of people, there was He JianBin, one of her high school classmates. He JianBin was from one of the old monies in City S. Her family had been around for tens of years and could certainly be considered as eminent. Plus, her family was very closed to many important people in Capital City and would have first-hand news many times.Fang JunRong had a pretty good relationship with He JianBin. They weren\u2019t as close as she and Xu WeiWei, but they were still quite close. Part of the reason the Li\u2019s Company was able to grow so much was because of the Fong\u2019s network.She recalled that the He\u2019s was one of the old-timers of City S, that is, until He ShuHua, He JianBin\u2019s niece, decided to fall for Wang Xiao, the prince of the underworld. She wanted to become his fianc\u00e9e no matter what. Once she knew of Jiang YaGe, she started to target her. Wang Xiao, who was madly in love with Jiang YaGe, backed Jiang YaGe and set the He\u2019s up. In the end, he sent many of the He\u2019s members to jail. He was then able to pick up a lot of what was left behind by the He\u2019s and became the top dog of City S.Once again, the romance brain could be very detrimental! Especially for the niece of He JianBin. For the sake of pleasing Wang Xiao, she even stole some of her family secrets and handed them over to him. She had definitely played a big role in the fast collapse of the He\u2019s.As for Wang Xiao, Fang JunRong hated his guts. Not only was he the culprit that led to her daughter\u2019s death, he was also a very ruthless person. He had no regards for morals or laws and would do whatever that pleased him. He would not hesitate to target anyone who wasn\u2019t nice to Jiang YaGe. He brought destruction upon several families.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, she had no intention to help out Li WangJin in the very least. She was just going to chitchat with her old friend some and let her know to be mindful of certain things. Without the collapse of the He\u2019s, Wang Xiao would not be able to come in power smoothly and she\u2019d have one more alliance on her side.Looking at her, He JianBin was genuinely surprised. \u201cYour skin is looking even better. Have you been using some kind of magical pills lately?\u201dFang JunRong curved her lips upward and said, \u201cYes, I have been using this new kind of beautifying pills. They are quite effective. I will send you some in a few days.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d He JianBin wasn\u2019t going to turn down her offer. It was quite obvious that the two of them wanted to chat privately. Noticing that, the others left them be and gave them the room to chat alone.Fang JunRong remembered the novel that she has read and asked, \u201cI recall that your family is planning on bidding on a piece of land?\u201dHe JianBin nodded and asked, \u201cYes, are you bidding on it too?\u201d She joked, knowing that this would not be possible. After all, the bidding would be starting in a week. It\u2019d be too late for the Li\u2019s or the Fang\u2019s to jump in at this point.Fang JunRong lowered her voice and said, \u201cYour niece is Wang Xiao\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, right? Better watch out and not let her know your bottom line.\u201dIn her previous life, Wang Xiao was the one who ended up outbidding the He\u2019s and winning that piece of land. The He\u2019s lost all of their prior investment and it was costly.He JianBin looked more solemn now. She knew Fang JunRong well. She would never have brought this up if she didn\u2019t know anything about it. Meaning, that was probably what had happened. Thinking of that, she really wanted to go and beat up her niece right away.Has she lost her mind? If she brought down the He\u2019s, what would she have left without her own backing?She took a deep breath and calmed herself down. She toasted Fang JunRong and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d She was just about to repay her favor by giving her some information, but she saw Fang JunRong putting her finger over her lips, gesturing to her that it would not be necessary.He JianBin was surprised but didn\u2019t share anything in the end. She seemed to recall some rumors about Fang JunRong and Li WangJin recently. She had assumed those rumors were spread by evil people who just wanted to stir things up maliciously. But could they be true?\u201cYou and Li WangJin\u2026.?\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s look was much more distant. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about him.\u201dHe JianBin got the message. The He\u2019s had only been helping out the Li\u2019s for the sake of Fang JunRong, but looking at her right now, that would not be necessary anymore going forward. Now that they had understood each other, she switched the subject to some fashion show that she had watched the previous week and never brought up work again.Li WangJin, seeing the two chatting and chuckling with each other, felt a sense of relief and was more confident in his conversation with others. He walked over to them with his wine glass in hand.***As far as Sun Mei, who strongly disliked Fang JunRong, was concerned, the better Fang JunRong looked, showing no signs of distress, the fouler her own mood. This was particularly the case when her husband completely ignored her and openly brought along his secretary \u2013 the one that was his new love \u2013 today.When she saw how Li WangJin was nice and tender to Fang JunRong in front of the others, she was so disgusted by it that she could puke.Sun Mei had always been the kind who didn\u2019t like to see others happy when she wasn\u2019t happy herself. In a moment of weakness, she went over to instigate.She walked over to Li WangJin and put up a very obviously fake surprised look. \u201cEh, Boss Li came with JunRong today? I thought you would be bringing someone else.\u201dHer tone was full of evilness, obviously waiting for drama to unfold.Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t be happier with Sun Mei\u2019s timing. She played along with her and put on a doubtful look. \u201cWho else would he bring if not me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three of them together looked like a family of three.\u201d Sun Mei had no idea about the relationship between Jiang YaGe and Wang SiXian. She assumed they were mother and daughter because they looked like each other. She thought that the younger one might even be Li WangJin\u2019s daughter out of the wedlock. She felt even better thinking about that. Her husband might have lovers blatantly, but at least he has never had illegitimate kids.Fang JunRong frowned lightly at Li WangJin.Li WangJin was very calm. He had been prepared for this moment. Casually, he said, \u201cNo, that was YaGe and her aunt. Her aunt had returned and YaGe has been down lately, so I took her to visit her aunt. I have mentioned that to you before.\u201dFang JunRong looked like she was just reminded of it and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I had forgotten all about it.\u201dShe turned to Sun Mei and said, \u201cOh, Sun Mei. You should look into the facts first before you pass it along next time. Don\u2019t just believe in everything you hear. The ones you were talking about are our adopted daughter and her aunt. We have known each other for years. I know you meant well, but had I not known better I\u2019d think you were trying to instigate purposefully.\u201dLi WangJin, who was almost caught red-handed hated Sun Mei, who had tried time and again to instigate between him and his wife. He couldn\u2019t be bothered with maintaining his usual gentlemanly front. He said to her coldly, \u201cIf you have so much free time, you should spend them on your own husband. Don\u2019t always try to instigate. That\u2019s why Boss Su doesn\u2019t like to be around you.\u201dAs the old adage goes, one should never hit where it hurt the most during an argument. Li WangJin couldn\u2019t have said anything worse to Sun Mei. She was so angry that she couldn\u2019t throw her wine glass at him. Her teeth grinded together loudly. At that very moment, Li WangJin had successfully replaced Fang JunRong as Sun Mei\u2019s number one most hated person.That moment, Sun Mei had made up her mind that she\u2019d have someone tailed Li WangJin 24/7. She wanted to see what he had to say for himself when she had definite proof of him having an affair.Fang JunRong hadn\u2019t expected Li WangJin to maximize Sun Mei\u2019s hate level in one go. She was ecstatic. It looked like Sun Mei would for sure become her number one aid in spreading words about Li WangJin in the future. All her instigation wasn\u2019t in vain.As such, Fang JunRong was in a good mood for the rest of the time.After the banquet, Li WangJin left with Fang JunRong.On their way back. Li WangJin asked the question he cared about the most, \u201cWhat did you talk to He JianBin about? Did she give you some insider information?\u201dFang JunRong collected some of her smile and said nonchalantly, \u201cNo, we just talked a little about some of the fashion shows this year.\u201dLi WangJin didn\u2019t look too happy. \u201cI thought you two are good friends. She wouldn\u2019t even give you some information?\u201dFang JunRong harrumphed and said, \u201cExactly because we are good friends, so I wouldn\u2019t pry about what she didn\u2019t want to share. I am friends with her because we get along well with each other, not because of her usefulness.\u201dShe gave Li WangJin a very disappointed look. \u201cHere I thought you understand about the pure friendship that\u2019s between me and her. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s how you look at us. You have disappointed me so much.\u201dIn the past, Jiang YaGe had always said how she only befriended those she got along with, not so much for what they could bring her. Many praised that she was pure and kind.Fang JunRong had come to realize that as revolting as Jiang YaGe\u2019s words were, they worked like a charm against Li WangJin.Li WangJin was, immediately, speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Holding back what he wanted to say was like torture.As he was in a not-so-good mood, Li WangJin didn\u2019t say much after that and Fang JunRong was able to have a peaceful time. Fang JunRong half closed her eyes and started thinking about the content of the book. She suddenly remembered a very important part of it.Based on her memories of her previous life, Jiang YaGe would be saving Wang Xiao in the next few days. Fang JunRong had some recollection of the incident. Jiang YaGe already had her bracelet by then and had successfully developed the White Jade Cream. After Jiang YaGe had saved him, she hid him under her bed and used the White Jade Cream to heal him. That was how Wang Xiao fell in love with the kind Jiang YaGe who never looked at him with prejudice. Ever since then, Wang Xiao\u2019s sword would point whichever direction that Jiang YaGe\u2019s little heart desired.Fang JunRong figured that Xiao Wang should be arriving in the next few days.Fang JunRong\u2019s lips curved a little bit \u2013 she wondered how Jiang YaGe would heal Wang Xiao during this life without the magical drug, White Jade Cream. Would she take him to the hospital or use regular medications on him privately? Of course, Fang JunRong hoped it was the latter. That way, even if Wang Xiao had only sustained minor injuries, it\u2019d turn into serious issues with the delay in time. She could then nicely call the cops.She didn\u2019t get it sometimes. Wouldn\u2019t a normal person\u2019s first reaction after running into an injured, vicious-looking, obviously a criminal person be either calling the cops or taking him to the hospital? What was going through Jiang YaGe\u2019s mind to bring him home and try to nurse him back to health?She thought about it for a bit and arrived at a conclusion; must be his looks! After all, Wang Xiao was a good-looking man. Why else would that He ShuHua acted like she was spellbound?Fang JunRong had long been prepared for this. She had placed spy cameras in Jiang YaGe\u2019s room before she moved in. They would come in very handy now.***This was a night with a bright moon and few stars. Jiang YaGe was on her way home with her backpack. She had gone out with her roommates today and didn\u2019t notice the time. She had wanted to call the chauffeur to pick her up, but the chauffeur was already on his way to pick up Zhong Yi. So she decided to head home on her own.She turned a corner and a shadow covered her and a shadow on the ground in front of her. The very next second, she was enveloped in the smell of blood.Jiang YaGe let out a cry, but before the cry had turned into a shriek, she saw a handsome face and stopped herself. Her face flustered. Li ShiZe, living under the same roof as her, was already an incredibly handsome man, and this strange man was almost every bit as handsome. In addition, there was an even stronger male pheromone radiating from him, making her knees weak.\u201cIf you dare make a sound, I will kill you. Now take me back to your place.\u201dShe was pushed onto the ground by the man and she felt the coldness of metal on her neck. It was a pistol.Wang Xiao reminded her of a wolf. Dangerous, but also very appealing. She bit her lower lips and said softly, \u201cYou are hurt. I can help you.\u201dThe man wanted to say something else. His eyes were filled with alertness, but finally his hand fell and he lost consciousness.Jiang YaGe paused for a bit before she struggled out from under the man. Under the street light, she could see a terrifying bloody hole on his left arm. She turned pale uncontrollably \u2013 it looked like it\u2019d hurt a lot. Blood was still coming out of the would and dripping onto the ground.She hesitated for a little bit and finally decided to take him home anyway \u2013 would he be taken to the cops if she took him to the hospital? As vicious as he looked, Jiang YaGe refused to believe that someone with that face could be a criminal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lucky for her, there was nobody else home, as though an invisible force was trying to help her out. She seemed to vaguely recall that her adopted parents went to a banquet tonight and wouldn\u2019t be home anytime soon. Li ShiZe had been spending most of his time at the office recently and Li XinYun was gone on a trip.She found a trolly, dragged the man into her room, and hid him inside her bathroom. Her bathroom was quite big, so having him in there wasn\u2019t an issue at all. She pulled out a mattress and put it on the floor.She even ran back outside and cleaned up the blood left behind by him. She rummaged through the closet, found the first aid kit, and bandaged the wound for the strange man. After she was done with all those, she smiled lightly.As there was one more person inside her room, she didn\u2019t sleep too deeply that night and woke up before the sky was bright. Jiang YaGe went to check on the man in the bathroom. He hasn\u2019t woken up yet.Maybe she could make some porridge for him \u2013 that idea just popped into her head.***Going downstairs, Fang JunRong could smell the aroma of meat porridge. She looked over and saw Jiang YaGe setting up bowls and chopsticks. Hearing noises, Jiang YaGe turned around and smiled at her. \u201cMom, I\u2019ve made breakfast. Try some and let me know what you think of my cooking.\u201dJiang YaGe had only intended to make some bone porridge for Wang Xiao, but she needed a cover up for it, so she just said she was making breakfast for everyone. That would also gain her brownie points.Fang JunRong said nonchalantly, \u201cMrs. Zhang can take care of all those.\u201dJiang YaGe smiled and said, \u201cYou and dad had done so much for me. I want to do something to show my appreciation too. Plus Mrs. Zhang has been cooking for us every day. She can use a break.\u201dThe admiration and trust in her sparkling eyes made it difficult to turn her down. Mrs. Zhang, standing next to her, immediately looked fonder of her.Fang JunRong must admit that when Jiang YaGe wanted to flatter someone, she was very good at it. Too bad Fang JunRong\u2019s heart had already been hardened and she wasn\u2019t moved by that at all. Why was Jiang YaGe offering to cook all of a sudden? Had Wang Xiao arrived already?Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t flattered by her, but it worked like a charm on Li WangJin and Li ShiZe. Li WangJin, especially, wouldn\u2019t stop singing her praises. He praised how delicious the soup was and how familial Jiang YaGe was.Particularly after he saw the blister on her finger from cooking the porridge, he felt so bad for her that all he wanted to do was to take her shopping. His passion died down quickly thinking about the cash that he had remaining. He looked at Fang JunRong with anticipation.Fang JunRong had been married to him for years and more or less had an idea of what was going through his mind.She chuckled to herself and went back inside her own room after half a bowl of porridge.***During the next few days, Fang JunRong spent quite a bit of time looking at the surveillance videos. She was surprised that Wang Xiao had ran into Jiang YaGe just like he did in her previous life.Wang Xiao was alarmed toward Jiang YaGe at the beginning, but after Jiang YaGe had been treating his wound and feeding him three meals a day, his attitude toward her had obviously softened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang YaGe had tried very hard to cover up for Wang Xiao. Sharing a secret and staying inside the same room day in and day out, the peculiar air between the two was obvious even through the surveillance video. Jiang YaGe had also forbidden others to clean her room recently. All she said was she could take care of her own room and she didn\u2019t want to increase the work of the servants.With his uninjured hand, Wang Xiao taught Jiang YaGe how to use the pistol \u2013 there were more physical contacts during these lessons. Even through the camera, it was obvious that Wang Xiao\u2019s possessiveness toward her was growing by the day. Jiang YaGe, who was usually very sensitive to these things, was very blinded this time and had no idea about it at all. She only thought of Wang Xiao as a friend, even though Wang Xiao would cross the friendship line and stroke her hair occasionally.That\u2019s right. She had always boasted that she was a friend of Wang Xiao and she wanted to help him.Her ability to completely overlook the truth had thoroughly impressed Fang JunRong. She questioned Jiang YaGe\u2019s faithfulness to her son. She wasn\u2019t upset about it though; quite the contrary, she was happy to see that. She felt that Jiang YaGe probably also possessed the buff to lower one\u2019s intelligence. Wang Xiao was plenty mighty when plotting against one\u2019s family, covering every single detail. But now, in front of Jiang YaGe, he behaved like an idiot. He let Jiang YaGe treat him with basic first aid skills and completely forgot that he shouldn\u2019t delay seeking treatment for his wound.Perhaps that was what love was.Unfortunately for them, their days in paradise didn\u2019t last too long. Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t a professional nurse after all. All the treatment methods that she had applied on him were from Baidu. She had no experience taking care of a wound and didn\u2019t even apply basic disinfection. Wang Xiao finally succumbed to an infection and ran a high fever.Jiang YaGe was very worried. She had tried fever reducers, putting cold towels on his forehead, etc. Nothing worked. Wang Xiao was running such a high fever that his face was beet red. Jiang YaGe didn\u2019t want anything to happen to him, so she gritted her teeth and decided to take him to the hospital, even if that meant she\u2019d alert others.Once Jiang YaGe had made up her mind, she was very proactive. She put on a cap, a mask, and a pair of shades on Wang Xiao and helped him up with difficulty. Luckily, even though Wang Xiao was half-conscious from the fever, he was still able to regain some consciousness when she had woken him up and worked with her. Otherwise, it\u2019d be quite difficult for Jiang YaGe to pick him up by herself.She tried her best to not make too many noises and was pleased that the Li\u2019s didn\u2019t have too many helpers, thus reducing the chances of someone being alerted. The mansion, however, was big and any amount of noises would be amplified. Jiang YaGe had always wanted to live in a large house as it would give her the illusion that she was a princess. But now, she was worried the entire time and felt that the way to the front door was so incredibly long. Time seemed to be crawling.She had finally reached the door when she heard footsteps and a sluggish voice.\u201cYaGe, what are you doing?\u201dAt the same time, the chandelier was turned on.The sudden light hurt Jiang YaGe\u2019s eyes and she closed them reflexively. She felt that her heart almost leapt out of her throat.She opened up her eyes. Under the light, Fang JunRong had a superior coldness in her look. She was already over forty years old but didn\u2019t have any wrinkles that belonged to her age. Her face was smooth and clear like a porcelain art.Startled, her grip loosened and Wang Xiao fell directly onto the floor with a loud \u201cBANG\u201d. It sure sounded like that would hurt a lot. His injury was most likely worsened by that fall.Fang JunRong\u2019s lips tightened \u2013 she wondered if that Wang Xiao had fractured a bone or two? Would he be able to save his arm?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She would only be happier. When she saw that Jiang YaGe was trying to get Wang Xiao out of the house, she came out purposefully to add fuel to the fire.She also wasn\u2019t worried that Wang Xiao would do anything to hurt her. First of her, his pistol was already put away by Jiang YaGe. Plus, when he was running such a high fever, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do much even if he had wanted to.Fang JunRong carefully hid her look of disgust. With a teasing look, she asked Jiang YaGe, \u201cIs that you boyfriend, YaGe? You should have told us that you already have a boyfriend. Your dad kept saying that he wanted to introduce some nice men to you.\u201dJiang YaGe was so nervous that she was sweating. She denied reflexively, \u201cNo, no. We are just friends\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s right. The one that she likes is Li ShiZe. He looked distant but would only show her his tender side. She only thought of Wang Xiao as a good friend\u2026 Over the course of the last few days, she had learned Wang Xiao\u2019s name and his identity. Nevertheless, Jiang YaGe didn\u2019t think that was a big deal nor would she look at him with prejudice based on his past. Quite the contrary, that fact that he was once a gang member made him all the more appealing to her.Fang JunRong\u2019s smile deepened, except her smile was only superficial. \u201cI know you girls are always shy and don\u2019t want to admit to it.\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s face was so red that it would bleed. She just kept on shaking her head in denial. She didn\u2019t want Li ShiZe\u2019s mother to think of her as an easy woman. That thought occupied her so much that she had temporarily forgotten about Wang Xiao who had fallen onto the floor.Fang JunRong came down the stairs and asked, \u201cDid something happen to your friend?\u201dThat was when Jiang YaGe finally remembered about Wang Xiao. Panic in her voice, she said, \u201cHe was injured and is running a fever from infection. I am just about to take him to the hospital.\u201dFang JunRong nodded and said, \u201cOkay. Let me call up the chauffeur and have him take us to the hospital.\u201dShe hoped heaven would hear her prayer and Wang Xiao would turn into a fool from the high fever. It would probably be a good thing for society if he became a fool anyway. What she really wanted to know was whether Wang Xiao would still be crazy over Jiang YaGe after what she had done to him.Noticing that Fang JunRong didn\u2019t ask any more questions, Jiang YaGe thought she had successfully dodged the bullet and let out a sigh of relief. She was very worried about her adopted mother asking why she brought a stranger into the house.Fang JunRong called the chauffeur over. With the help of the chauffeur, Jiang YaGe was able to shove Wang Xiao inside of the car successfully.About half an hour later, they arrived at the closest hospital. After Wang Xiao\u2019s hat and shades were taken off, Fang JunRong put on an appropriate look of surprise. \u201cOh, it was him!\u201dWang Xiao\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t good, and he had already been taken into a patient room.Jiang YaGe turned to Fang JunRong and asked, \u201cMom, you know him?\u201dFang JunRong nodded slightly and said to her nonchalantly, \u201cOf course. He\u2019s the future son-in-law of the He\u2019s.\u201dThis was the first time Jiang YaGe heard about this. Her mouth dropped open, and she couldn\u2019t describe the emotions that she was feeling right now. He was already engaged and he lied to her\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, she was just friends with Wang Xiao. She forced an indifferent smile on herself and said, \u201cHis fianc\u00e9e must be a very nice girl.\u201dFang JunRong thought about He ShuHua and wanted to light a candle for the He\u2019s \u2013 having such a daughter who\u2019d only had romance in her brain and would bring down the entire family. She gave her a very professional smile and said, \u201cShe is a good match for him.\u201dOne only had romance in her brain and the other was ruthless. They would be a match made in heaven had He ShuHua been his real love.Jiang YaGe lowered her head. She figured that the girl must be of a high status, unlike herself. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a shred of inferiority complex. She might be the adopted daughter of the Li\u2019s, but she was still a tier below the real ladies.Capturing all the emotions on Jiang YaGe, Fang JunRong just found it funny. She thought the one that Jiang YaGe liked was her BBQ-pork son. Why did it look like she also has feelings for Wang Xiao? Was that two-timing?Fang JunRong continued to rave about He ShuHua. She praised her family standing, how pretty she was, and her education background. Fang JunRong didn\u2019t like He ShuHua much, but as long as that would negatively impact Jiang YaGe, she\u2019d be very happy to praise her despite her true feelings toward her.During this lifetime, Fang JunRong had already given He JianBing a heads up. The He\u2019s should be prepared, and it wouldn\u2019t be as easy for Wang Xiao to obtain their secrets.\u201cSay, how come he was over at our place? Did he come looking for you?\u201d Even though Fang JunRong knew the truth, she\u2019d still have to pretend that she didn\u2019t know anything.Jiang YaGe faltered and said, \u201cHe was injured and he came and hid at our place. Perhaps he knew that he\u2019d be safe as our place, that\u2019s why he came.\u201d She didn\u2019t dare let Fang JunRong know that she was the one who brought him back, so she had to make up something.Fang JunRong tightened her lips a bit and said, \u201cIs that what happened? It looks like we are going to need to replace our security guards. They didn\u2019t even know that someone had trespassed. Luckily, he wasn\u2019t some bad person.\u201dIt was only because her daughter wasn\u2019t home these past few days, so Fang JunRong didn\u2019t care that Wang Xiao was there. Plus, she wanted to let Jiang YaGe drag out not properly treating Wang Xiao\u2019s injury for a few more days. Otherwise, she would have called the cops a long time ago.After what seemed like forever, the doctor finally finished examining Wang Xiao and came out.The doctor with white hair frowned and asked, \u201cWhich one of you is his next of kin?\u201dJiang YaGe lifted her head up. Perhaps because she hadn\u2019t had any water for a while, her throat felt dry and her voice was hoarse. \u201cI am a friend of his. How is he doing?\u201d She suddenly felt anxious and worried that she\u2019d hear bad news from the doctor. She had been taking good care of his wound these last few days. He should be fine?The doctor said, \u201cHe\u2019s not doing too well. You took him here too late\u2026\u201dHearing the doctor\u2019s words, Fang JunRong wanted to set off fireworks and rejoice.Karma!She then looked over at Jiang YaGe. Her lips were pale and she looked frantic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his dream, Jiang YaGe laid in his arms like waterweeds wrapping around him, making his heart beat quickly. The two of them held hands passionately like lovers.It was so nice in the dream that he didn\u2019t even want to wake up.Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t like any other woman that he had met in the past. She seemed fragile but had a tough side to her. They had never met each other before and he had almost killed her, but she never looked at him with any prejudice. Instead, she had taken good care of him. To him, she was like a beam of sunlight in the dark, warm and bright.Suddenly, it started raining. The rain fell onto him and he picked up Jiang YaGe\u2019s hand and wanted to run away with her. The dark sky suddenly cracked open and blaringly bright light came through with no reservation.Wang Xiao had woken up. His eyes weren\u2019t used to the brightness in the room.He felt something wet on his face ,and it was hot. He struggled to open his eyes and immediately saw Jiang YaGe\u2019s reddened eyes. Wang Xiao realized that the wetness on his cheek was her tears.So there was someone who\u2019d cry for a man who lived in the dark.Wang Xiao couldn\u2019t describe his feelings, except that he felt both aching and softness in his heart. These emotions were unfamiliar to him. With the exception of Jiang YaGe, he couldn\u2019t think about any other females. That was, until an elegant female voice interrupted him.\u201cWang Xiao, are you alright?\u201d Fang JunRong interrupted the two of them staring at each other. She felt that the two could keep on looking at each other for another half an hour otherwise.Wang Xiao turned toward the voice and saw Fang JunRong \u2013 he had met her at his engagement party with He ShuHua. But how was it that Fang JunRong looked younger than when he last saw her?Wang Xiao paused for a second and said, \u201cAunty Fang.\u201dHe was still amicable with the He\u2019s and needed to maintain basic courtesy as a front. But what was Fang JunRong doing there?Fang JunRong sighed and said, \u201cYou are ShuHua\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and I see you as a nephew. Why didn\u2019t you say something sooner if you are injured so we could take you to the hospital? Now you\u2019ve waited so long that your minor injury has worsened.\u201dWang Xiao felt like he was hit by a rock and felt a little dizziness. \u201cWorsened how?\u201dHis wound has been treated, no? It should be mostly healed by now.Even though he was running a fever, Wang Xiao just thought that was caused by him catching a cold. He never thought that it could be an infection from his wound.Fang JunRong looked at him with a pitying gaze and said, \u201cThe doctor had examined you. He said that your wound wasn\u2019t treated properly and had an infection for days. As the area of infection was relatively big, when they have the operation, they will need to remove part of the damaged tissues. They might not be able to preserve all of your nerves.\u201dMeaning, he might be handicapped.Thinking of that, Fang JunRong had a strong desire to give Jiang YaGe a large red packet.\u201cHow horrible. If you were taken to the hospital right when you were injured, you would have recovered by now. Say, who was it that treated you? They didn\u2019t even perform basic disinfection and the bandages were wrapped so tightly that it had caused an infection. Lucky for you, our YaGe had found you and taken you to the hospital. It would have gotten even worse had you waited even longer.\u201dWang Xiao almost puked out blood. He instinctively looked over at Jiang YaGe \u2013 so she was the one that made his wound worse?His left arm might be handicapped. All of the fondness that he had toward Jiang YaGe was all gone and possibly would continue to go the other direction.His arm! It was all this woman\u2019s fault!He stared viciously at Jiang YaGe. Too bad he didn\u2019t have his pistol with him, else he would probably just shoot her right now.Feeling the killing intent and hostility coming from him, Jiang YaGe couldn\u2019t help but let out a whimper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She followed the instructions online to the T.Pearl-like tears filled her eyes and rolled down her light-colored cheeks, making her look even all the more pitiful. The Wang Xiao a day ago would have felt his heart ached had he seen this. The Wang Xiao right now could only think about how his left arm might be ruined and the culprit that had caused it was standing in front of him with her pitiful look. It only made him hate her more.His look was vicious like a demon who wanted to tear up a human. His ferocious and terrifying look gave Jiang YaGe the chills, and she reflexively shuddered a bit. She had never seen Wang Xiao looking so terrifying before today.\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to do that. I just wanted to help you.\u201d Terrified, she even hiccuped from crying too hard, looking even more pitiful.Fang JunRong put on a surprised look. \u201cYaGe, why do you need to apologize to him? You were kind enough to take him to the hospital. Why would he be mad at you? The one who caused his wound to worsen was the one who treated him. It has nothing to do with you.\u201dShe acted like she was feeling unjust for Jiang YaGe.Wang Xiao\u2019s eyes were burning with fire when he looked at Jiang YaGe. \u201cYou\u2026 you skank! You did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you?! You kept me in your room just to delay the time I could receive treatment!\u201dThe more Wang Xiao thought about it, the more that made sense to him. What other normal woman would bring a man with a gunshot wound home and not be afraid of him? She was probably sent by his rivals to fool him with her looks while waiting for his wound to worsen.He hadn\u2019t expected having been so brilliant his entire life that he would have fallen to this woman.He stared at her so intensely that his eyes could split apart. His fury burned so high that he was no longer able to think. He struggled to lunge at her but was too weak from his temperature. Trying to move, only disturbed his injury and his face twisted from the pain.Jiang YaGe was terrified by his demonic look and couldn\u2019t help but take a few steps back. Finally, not being able to bear it anymore, she turned around and ran out of the room.Fang JunRong kindly pushed the button for Wang Xiao to notify the medical staff before she, too, left the room. The drama tonight was amazing. In her previous life, Jiang YaGe was Wang Xiao\u2019s goddess. It looked like she\u2019d be his enemy in this lifetime. Knowing how vindictive Wang Xiao was, lots more would be coming Jiang YaGe\u2019s way for making him her enemy.Thinking about what had happened to both XinYun and herself in her previous life, Fang JunRong wished the two of them would try to hurt each other as much as possible. Truth be told, she felt that Wang Xiao should take half the responsibilities for what had happened to him.Jiang YaGe did not possess professional knowledge in treating gunshot wounds, so it\u2019s only natural for her to treat it like a normal wound. That Wang Xiao would just trust a complete stranger and left it all up to her? She couldn\u2019t think of another plausible explanation other than his intelligence was lowered by his desire for Jiang YaGe. But, Wang Xiao would never admit that he was partially responsible for it and would blame it all on Jiang YaGe.When she found Jiang YaGe, Jiang YaGe was still crying silently, looking pained and full of sorrow.Fang JunRong asked, \u201cWang Xiao said you kept him in your room for days just to delay him seeking treatment, was that true?\u201dShe switched to a stern tone. \u201cYou are not the only one who lives there. Have you ever considered the safety of others? Or is that you think he is more important than the rest of us combined?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s not true! I only wanted to help him. I thought he was a good person then.\u201dFang JunRong brought up another point. \u201cIf you truly wanted to help him, why didn\u2019t you take him to the hospital sooner?\u201dJiang YaGe was speechless. She couldn\u2019t very well say that she worried that Fang JunRong\u2019s first reaction would be to call the cops had she seen Wang Xiao. She would never have guessed that Fang JunRong knew Wang Xiao.Recalling Wang Xiao\u2019s hateful look, she felt chills all over again. What should she do? It seemed like she had offended a very scary person.She then comforted herself. It\u2019d be fine. She\u2019s the adopted daughter of the Li\u2019s, not that commoner with no backing that she used to be. Wang Xiao would offend the Li\u2019s if he tried to hurt her. But, even so, she still felt very perturbed. And all she could do was to remind herself to be careful always.***Fang JunRong called the hospital again after a few days and asked about Wang Xiao\u2019s condition. She learned that Wang Xiao has already had his surgery and that even though his left arm was saved, as some of the damaged tissues had been removed, it would never regain 100% of it\u2019s mobility.Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t help but sigh in disappointment. Jiang YaGe hadn\u2019t done sufficient damage after all.She did, however, have a pretty good understanding of what kind of person that Wang Xiao was. She knew that he was a very vindictive person and his modus operandi was to destroy one\u2019s entire family. He wasn\u2019t yet that Wang Xiao, who had utterly power in City S toward the end of her previous life, so what he could do was still somewhat limited.Nevertheless, just to be on the safe side, Fang JunRong hired a few bodyguards to stay with her and her daughter. She thought about it a little more and sent a couple to Zhong Yi as well. As for the others, how did that concern her?Li ShiZe and Li WangJin loved Jiang YaGe, right? Logic would dictate that they must be very happy to face the consequences of her actions. Jiang YaGe seemed to be on the alert as well and avoided leaving the house.Just as Fang JunRong had anticipated, Wang Xiao wasn\u2019t one who\u2019d remain silent for long. Not being able to locate Jiang YaGe, he turned toward their company instead \u2013 after all, Jiang YaGe was the Li\u2019s adopted daughter on paper.The Wang Xiao right now was not yet bold enough to go against the Li\u2019s openly so he only used a disguised method behind their backs.For example, someone had splattered the front door of their company with feces. Li WangJin\u2019s brand new luxury car was keyed. When Li WangJin went to attend a banquet, he was splashed with swill. When a series of incidents happened over the course of 2 ~ 3 days, it wasn\u2019t difficult for Li WangJin to figure out that he was targeted by someone. He jumped up and down in anger, but neither the police or private eye that he hired could find out who was behind all of it.Finally, he complained to Fang JunRong and turned to her for help. As much as he didn\u2019t want to admit it, Fang JunRong had a much better network than he did. After all, the Fang\u2019s have been well established since tens of years ago. A newly risen nouveau riche like himself somewhat has an idea of that.Naturally, Fang JunRong knew it had to do with Wang Xiao. But she enjoyed watching all those things that had been happening to Li WangJin, so of course she wasn\u2019t going to help him out. As for Wang Xiao targeting Li WangJin, that was probably because he had doted on Jiang YaGe. As she had Wang Xiao tailed, she also had her people record videos of what Wang Xiao had been doing to Li WangJin. They might come in handy later on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why is it that it is only happening to you?\u201dLi WangJin said without hesitation, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I get along with everyone.\u201d\u201cYou must have offended someone without knowing. Why else would someone target you like that. Just give it some more thought. Do you have any idea who it might be? It\u2019s difficult to try to help you without any leads.\u201dLi WangJin only turned to her hoping that she could use her network to help him, not have her interrogate him like he was a criminal. Not to mention that she seemed to imply that he had brought this upon himself. Her words made him disgruntled, but there was nothing he could do about it.As for enemies, with the magnitude of the Li\u2019s business, he\u2019d naturally have a few of those. But he couldn\u2019t just go to them with no evidence.Feeling distressed, he turned to Wang SiXian for comfort. Wang SiXian also did her part and gave it her best to be the place that Li WangJin could turn to for comfort. That and under the influence of alcohol, the two of them proceeded to have intimacy with each other.Having installed spy cameras in the house, Fang JunRong naturally had first-hand high definition videos of it. It was still a week before her daughter\u2019s birthday, and it looked like she could be divorced before then.She lowered her head. She didn\u2019t feel sadness or anger from the disgusting surveillance video, but felt the lightness of the other shoe dropping.She watched the video over and over again and a happy smile appeared on her.Mmm. She should send a copy of this to Sun Mei who had been trying so hard to find dirt on Li WangJin. She trusted that Sun Mei would not let her down. As someone who has the reputation of being a kind and virtuous wife who had the utmost trust for her husband, naturally she would never do such a thing like spying on her own husband.***Ever since the banquet, Sun Mei had hired a few private eyes to tail Li WangJin. She was well aware of the unfortunate incidents that had befell upon him recently and that had provided her with a lot of enjoyment.Nevertheless, the most important thing to her was to find dirt on Li WangJin. That way she could shame that pretentious man and smash Fang JunRong\u2019s ridiculous trust for her husband at the same time. Ah, her woman\u2019s instinct told her that Li WangJin has already had intimacy with that other woman.She thought this would be dragged out much longer, but it went much faster than she had anticipated.She almost laughed out loud when she received the photos of Li WangJin and Wang SiXian on a date from her private eye.But those weren\u2019t enough\u2026 they were just pictures of the two of them hugging; nothing more substantial. As shameless as Li WangJin was, he\u2019d probably just say that\u2019s a hug between friends. That\u2019s the kind of hypocrite that he was.Oh, men!Sun Mei spitted on his face in her mind.She wondered if she\u2019d be able to have spy cameras installed in the house.Before she was even able to carry out her thoughts, within the next couple of hours, her private eye sent her updated information. Their efficiency was well worth the amount that she had paid them.Sun Mei was stunned by the very impactful video.Li WangJin\u2019s birthmark could be clearly seen in the video and that was exactly what she had wanted. She couldn\u2019t care less how her private eye was able to come across it.Sun Mei\u2019s face flustered from excitement. She cancelled out her plans for the afternoon and sent another 200,000 yuan to her private eye. With the USB drive in hand, she gave Fang JunRong a call. Her voice was high and clear, filled with confidence and a sense of superiority.\u201cHi, is this JunRong? There\u2019s something I want to show you. But be warned and don\u2019t be too sad when you see it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just look, Li WangJin did so well in front of you in the past. His true self is finally coming out now. I don\u2019t even understand where his bar is set. Why would he like a woman like her? But, don\u2019t feel too bad. I trust that he isn\u2019t serious about her. He would never want to divorce you.\u201dSun Mei might be comforting her verbally, but her look suggested otherwise. She had asked Fang JunRong out and couldn\u2019t wait to show her the video clip.She got a bit thirsty talking so much and took a sip of her beverage. She wasn\u2019t too happy at the quiet Fang JunRong. She neither cried or said anything, just watching the video attentively. That made Sun Mei felt that she had just punched cotton.\u201cIsn\u2019t there something you want to say?\u201dFang JunRong finally looked up at her and said, \u201cTruth be told, I had more or less felt that something wasn\u2019t right as of late, but I chose to believe him.\u201dSun Mei snickered. \u201cIf men\u2019s words are trustworthy then pigs can also fly.\u201d As she was talking, she had lost her interest. The entire time, the only thing she had wanted was to show Fang JunRong Li WangJin\u2019s true color so she could one-up Fang JunRong. But when it actually came true, she wasn\u2019t as excited as she had anticipated.\u201cI would never have guessed the person he is having an affair with is YaGe\u2019s aunt.\u201d It was very unfortunate that Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t able to cry right now. A few drops of tears would for sure make this seem more convincing.Even though the Li\u2019s had never officially introduced Jiang YaGe and Zhong Yi, Li WangJin was so nice to Jiang YaGe that he had taken her out plenty of times. As such, most of those in their circles were aware that Jiang YaGe was their adopted daughter.Sun Mei shook her head and started embellishing. \u201cJust look at her. She just has the look of an ungrateful, natural-born white-eyed wolf. What you have done was to bring a wolf into your house. Perhaps Li WangJin had given Jiang YaGe the title because of his lover.\u201dThe more she said, the more she believed that was the truth, and the more she despised Li WangJin.\u201cAye. It\u2019s alright. All men cheat. What\u2019s more important is to have control of the finances at home. Your problem is you put too much trust in him!\u201dAs she felt bad for Fang JunRong and that the two of them had bashed evil men together, Sun Mei no longer hated Fang JunRong as much as she did before. In fact, she felt that the two of them were on the same side.Fang JunRong asked her to send her a copy of the video, and of course, Sun Mei was more than willing to do that.Once she had the video clip, Fang JunRong stood up and said, \u201cOkay, I am going to take off now. Thank you so much today.\u201dHer tone was mild, but Sun Mei, somehow, was able to hear the storm that was to come. She felt very high spirited and offered, \u201cWould you like me to accompany you home?\u201d She had already envisioned how the two of them would be fighting with each other and was starting to get excited over it.Fang JunRong tightened her lips and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s alright.\u201dShe thanked Sun Mei and left. Looking from behind her, she saw that Sun Mei had pulled out her phone.Sun Mei started calling her mahjong friends and planned to share the story with them. She had always been a blabbermouth, especially after Li WangJin had offended her. All the more she wanted her revenge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her parents passed away early and both she and her brother were raised by her grandmother. The two of them were very close with each other. She needed to give her brother a heads up if she was to divorce Li WangJin. In her previous life, her brother sided with her and was also oppressed by Li WangJin and his son, causing his company to go belly up. She didn\u2019t know what happened to him after she was admitted to the mental institution, but figured it couldn\u2019t have ended well.The Fang\u2019s main line of business is clothing and the like. Her sister-in-law, especially, was a fairly well-known clothing designer. Fang JunRong\u2019s sister-in-law was her class sister in her college club; the two of them were quite close as well.She gave both her brother and her sister-in-law a call before she headed over, so they were both home when she arrived.Yang Xi had just returned from an overseas trip a few days ago. Her eyes lit up when she saw Fang JunRong. \u201cYou are looking better and better. Are you using a different brand of skin care products?\u201d As a woman, who didn\u2019t want to look younger and prettier?\u201cI have taken new beautifying pills lately. I\u2019ll send you some in a few days,\u201d said Fang JunRong. She had produced some more already and has been storing them in her jade dimension.Feng XueBo looked a lot like their grandfather. He was fairly plain looking, but has good temperament. He looked more like a scholar than a businessman. Smiling, he looked at the two women chatting with each other before he said, \u201cWhat brought you home all of a sudden?\u201dAs far as he was concerned, even after his sister had been married for 20 years, she was still family. He would always care about her.\u201cOh, I just wanted to talk about my divorce with you two,\u201d said Fang JunRong calmly.Feng XueBo\u2019s face dropped.Without further ado, Fang JunRong just showed them the video with audio. Normally, that\u2019d be quite awkward; but now, it just infuriated the couple.After the rage, Fang XueBo looked much more severe. \u201cAre you sure a divorce is what you want?\u201dFang JunRong nodded, \u201cThe signs had been there for a while now. He had never liked me meddling in the business of the company and his attitude toward me was perfunctory at best. Ever since the arrival of Jiang YaGe, he had treated her better than XinYun. He puts down XinYun all the time. He always puts Jiang YaGe above everything else.\u201dAs she listed them out one by one, Fang XueBo got angrier and angrier. He just wanted to beat up his brother-in-law \u2013 nay, soon-to-be ex-brother-in-law.\u201cWhat about the two children?\u201d Fang JunRong\u2019s two children were Yang Xi\u2019s biggest worry.\u201cOne of them is in college and the other just finished her college entry examination. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about affecting their school work.\u201dListening to what she had said, Fang XueBo had a curious feeling \u2013 why did he get the feeling that his sister had been waiting for this day for a while? Nah, it must be just his imagination. His sister has always been docile. And if she had changed, it\u2019d be all Li WangJin\u2019s fault.In the next half an hour that followed, Fang JunRong mostly discussed items related to the divorce with her brother. What Fang XueBo was most concerned about was the division of their assets; he didn\u2019t want his sister to get the short end of the stick. Nevertheless, considering the video, he figured Li WangJin, as the wrongful side, probably wouldn\u2019t be too adamant unless he was willing to give up all the good reputation that he had built up over the years.After they have completed their initial discussion, Fang XueBo and Fang JunRong headed toward Li\u2019s mansion together.When they arrived, Li WangJin and the others were just about to have dinner and her BBQ-Pork son was home as well. The three of them, sitting in front of the dining table, seemed so cozy and peaceful.Li WangJin even had a rare smile on him and he was soft spoken to Jiang YaGe. When he heard footsteps and saw Fang JunRong when he looked up, his smile froze on his face briefly. He regained his composure quickly and said, \u201cJunRong, you are home. Have you had dinner yet? I thought you were going to dine out?\u201dFang JunRong snickered and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t have an appetite for dinner. I was too upset.\u201dFang XueBo also looked at Li WangJin with disgust. In his mind, he had already slapped the label of \u201chypocrite\u201d on his brother-in-law.Li WangJin was no fool. He could feel the anger was directed at him. He frowned and asked, \u201cWho had crossed you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She eyed the bottle of red wine on the table and grabbed the bottle. She casted a cold look at Li WangJin, which made him shudder. He reflexively wanted to say something. The next second, the bottle was tilted and the red fluid inside was poured directly onto Li WangJin\u2019s head.Li WangJin was stunned. He thought he was dreaming. He had been married to Fang JunRong for so many years. Despite some arguments here and there, they had always stayed on the verbal level. They had never gotten physical.Red wine dripped down from his hair and was all over his face and his clothes. He had never been in such bad shape before. The cool feel of the fluid reminded him that this wasn\u2019t a dream. Just a moment ago, his wife had poured red wine all over him.After he recovered from being stunned. The anger burning inside of him made him look ferocious. \u201cYou! How dare you!\u201dFang JunRong smiled in response. She would use her action to let him know that not only did she dare. She even dared to do it more than once.Another bottle of red wine splashed at his face. The chilled red wine made him shuddered reflexively. As he hadn\u2019t expected her to do it a second time, he wasn\u2019t able to dodge the second time either.Li ShiZe\u2019s brows couldn\u2019t have furrowed more. His tone was unpleasant and with complaint. \u201cMom, stop being so unreasonable.\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s voice was weak. \u201cMom, are you in a bad mood?\u201dLi WangJin wiped his face with his hand and said angrily, \u201cJust because you are in a bad mood doesn\u2019t mean you can take it out on me! What is wrong with you today?\u201dIf he didn\u2019t care about his image in front of his brother-in-law and his children, Li WangJin wouldn\u2019t have stopped there. His hands were shaking from anger.Fang JunRong turned on her cellphone and played the video. She thrusted the screen forward, almost directly onto Li WangJin\u2019s face. With a very fake smile on her, she said to him, \u201cWang SiXian is skillful, I take it. Just look at how much you were enjoying yourself.\u201dThe enraged Li WangJin petrified and his look froze on his face when he saw the high-def screen. He looked like a quail with its neck pinched.Blood had left Jiang YaGe\u2019s face and her body started to shake. She looked like she could pass out any minute. \u201cYou\u2026 what are you talking about?\u201dFang JunRong cast a sharp look in her direction. \u201cOh, I took you in because I felt pity for you that your parents had passed away. But all I did was get myself a white-eyed wolf. I see how it is. You sent your own aunt straight to his bed in order to secure your own status.\u201cNo wonder Li WangJin had been spoiling you more than he did XinJun. All because your aunt had been whispering into his ears.\u201d Of course Fang JunRong knew the real reason why Li WangJin was so nice to Jiang YaGe, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t say what she wanted to. Besides, Jiang YaGe probably has the idea anyway; why else would she cover up for them time and again?Li ShiZe looked at the pale Jiang YaGe in disbelief and asked with difficulty, \u201cIs there some sort of misunderstanding?\u201d As mature as he was, Li ShiZe was still only a 19-year-old young man. He has yet to become the calm and composed man that he was later on in Fang JunRong\u2019s memory.Fang JunRong smiled, but the smile had no emotions behind it. She walked up and turned on the projector in the living room and casted the video from her cellphone directly to it.Li WangJin\u2019s eyes widened. He wanted to stop his wife, but he was stopped by Fang XueBo.He could do nothing but just stood there and watched the action film starring him and Wang SiXian. The air-conditioning was running at full force in the house, but he was drenched. His mind was drawing blank, and he had no idea what to do or say.Jiang YaGe could no longer support herself, and she collapsed onto the chair.Fang JunRong said expressionlessly. \u201cI want a divorce. You disgust me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will not have a divorce!\u201d His voice was very determined. Even though he had thought about a divorce previously, now wasn\u2019t the time yet. If they divorce now, he stood to lose too much.\u201cJunRong, that was an accident.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cWe were both drunk that day.\u201dFang JunRong pulled out a stack of photos from her purse and aimed them straight at his face. \u201cOh, were you also drunk when you two were hugging?\u201dShe had gotten all the pictures from Sun Mei.Li WangJin opened his mouth a bit. \u201cI\u2026\u201d He looked over at his son reflexively and hoped that Li ShiZe would help defend him. He knew very well how important her children were to her.Li ShiZe received his dad\u2019s look and sighed inwardly. He understood why his father, as a man, would want to cheat on his mother. But, it was pretty bad form to cheat with someone who\u2019s so close to home. And his mother was too overly rash for wanting a divorce over something like this. Just the thought that his family matters would turn into fodder for gossiping in their circle made Li ShiZe very uncomfortable.He looked over at Jiang YaGe. Jiang YaGe was in a trance and looked deeply sorrowful. She muttered to herself, \u201cHow could aunty do something like that? How could she do that to me?\u201dLooking at her, Li ShiZe\u2019s anger lessened. Not only was his mother the victim of this, YaGe was as well. YaGe has the tendency to feel that she was responsible for everything that had happened. Now that she had found out about this, she must feel very awful.He couldn\u2019t help but speak up for her, \u201cMom, YaGe is innocent.\u201dFang XueBo, who was upset at Li WangJin, whipped his head around when he heard that. His tone was off. \u201cYou are on her side?\u201dFang JunRong had already gotten used to his love-trumps-all attitude. Plus, having been reborn, she no longer looked at him as her son. Which was why she was still very calm after hearing that and didn\u2019t feel hurt at all.Fang XueBo was not quite the same as her. He had always had a good impression about this nephew. He never would have thought that after Li WangJin\u2019s disgusting behavior and Jiang YaGe\u2019s obvious involvement in this whole thing, Li ShiZe sided with the white-eyed wolf instead of his own mother.Jiang YaGe gave Li ShiZe an appreciative look and said softly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to speak up for me. It was my own fault. Had I noticed it sooner, I would for sure have tried to stop them. It is my place to be on the receiving end of mom\u2019s anger.\u201dHer weak voice plus her pale look made her look like a fragile flower under a storm. Li ShiZe\u2019s heart ached even more. His voice was even more decisive. He said to Fang JunRong with assertion, \u201cMom, this has nothing to do with YaGe. I understand that you are mad at Dad, but you shouldn\u2019t take it out on YaGe.\u201dFang JunRong glanced over at Jiang YaGe and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Her eyes are mere decorations. She goes out with them everyday but hasn\u2019t noticed a thing. If she isn\u2019t going to use her eyes, she should just donate them.\u201dLi ShiZe frowned and said, \u201cMom, how could you say something like that? That would hurt YaGe so when she heard it.\u201dFang JunRong has a certain level of admiration for Jiang YaGe. In just a mere month\u2019s time after she had arrived, she was able to charm her BBQ-Pork son so. To a point that she was the only one he could see in his eyes.She nodded and said, \u201cYes, I am cold and cruel. And someone as cruel and cold as me isn\u2019t good enough to be your mother. No need to call me Mom anymore in the future.\u201d She snickered and said, \u201cAny way you look at it, I should be the biggest victim here being betrayed by both of them. But, for some reason, the harm done to me doesn\u2019t measure up to Jiang YaGe\u2019s tears. Fine, consider that I have raised a worthless son. It\u2019s my own fault that I never learned how to cry.\u201dBy the time she was done, her look was cold and she looked away from Li ShiZe.Fang XueBo\u2019s hands were shaking from anger. His nephew was a normal person before. Whatever had happened to him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His colors changed. His assertive tone weakened and he seemed a little frantic. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201dHe had always taken advantage of his mother\u2019s love for him. In his mind, Fang JunRong would always defend him and be on his side. He hadn\u2019t expected that the privilege could be removed so easily.He sensed that his mother was truly upset this time.\u201cMom\u2026\u201d He muttered.Fang JunRong no longer wanted to talk to him. She turned to Li WangJin and said, \u201cJust find a time and sign the divorce papers.\u201dLi WangJin recollected himself and said in a decisive tone, \u201cI will not have a divorce.\u201d He then pleaded, \u201cGive me one more chance, please? I really don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201dFang JunRong was about to puke from his disgusting words. She said expressionlessly, \u201cOkay, so you don\u2019t want to have a divorce. We will sign an agreement. If you cheat on me again, you will leave with nothing. Plus, I don\u2019t want to ever see Jiang YaGe and Wang SiXian again. You will send them both away immediately.\u201dShe said that purposefully knowing full well that Li WangJin would never agree to that.Sure enough, Li WangJin was speechless right away. All the sweet nothings that he can conjure up was stuck in the middle of his throat. He had already been fed up with Fang JunRong\u2019s aggressiveness as of late and planned to divorce her sooner or later. If he was to sign the agreement now, then all his prospects would be gone.It wasn\u2019t difficult for Fang XueBo to figure out what was going through Li WangJin\u2019s mind when he saw the look on him. He snickered. \u201cI knew it. All you\u2019ve said were just empty words. So you can\u2019t part with them, huh? How did you find the guts to say you don\u2019t want a divorce?\u201dHe had thought about asking his sister to give it some more thought and not act too rashly. Now, seeing the behaviors of the father and son duo, Fang XueBo felt that they must get a divorce! All he could say was that that man was too good at hiding his true self and had everyone fooled in the past.Li WangJin has no retort, but he suddenly recalled something else. With an accusatory tone, he asked, \u201cHow did you get a hold of that video? Did you install a surveillance camera in the house?\u201dFang JunRong said nonchalantly, \u201cYou seemed to have forgotten that that is my house. But this video was given to me by someone else. As long as you agree to a divorce, I will not leak the video.\u201d Granted, she could only guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t pass it on. If it came from Sun Mei\u2019s end, then that has nothing to do with her.Li WangJin was frantic. He had no idea how many more videos his wife has. If she was to distribute them all, all his good reputation that he had spent years to build would be gone overnight. He ran his hands through his hair and made a big mess of it.He has, after all, a pretty good idea of Fang JunRong\u2019s personality. Once she had made up her mind, nothing could change it. If he didn\u2019t do as he was told, he worried that she\u2019d just leak the videos to get back at him and that was a consequence that he could handle.Li WangJin took a deep breath and put on a look of both despair and deep sorrow. \u201cOkay, if you insist on having a divorce, then we will have a divorce.\u201dLooking on the bright side, most of the employees at the company were his men; it\u2019d be impossible for Fang JunRong to take it over. As long as he still has the company, even if it hurt him a bit at the beginning, he would be able to recover and still be that Boss Li on the top of the food chain in City S.Fang JunRong walked up the stairs and said, \u201cOkay. I had already contacted the lawyer before I came over. He can come by anytime.\u201dLi WangJin didn\u2019t look too good. Even though he was prepared to divorce Fang JunRong, seeing how eager she was over it, it seemed as though all of his affection toward her in the past was all one-sided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFang JunRong was rarely involved in the company\u2019s business, but she has Xu WeiWei there. In recent months, Xu WeiWei had collected plenty of information for her, so Fang JunRong had a pretty good idea of what had been going on in their properties.Li WangJin and Fang JunRong\u2019s combined shares in Ayron Corporation came out to around 20 billion yuan. Meifang Corporation, a company specialized in skin care products, had just gone IPO and was relatively smaller in scale in comparison. But the land it was on was pricey, so its market price was still at 6 billion yuan. As for other stocks, cash, properties, they came out to be around 15 billion yuan, give or take. Oh, right, then there were the antiques and paintings that Li WangJin had been buying over the years. Their face values came out to 5 billion yuan. After all, values of antiques have appreciated in recent years.As for the jewellery and cars, Fang JunRong didn\u2019t even throw them into the formula. She gathered that Li WangJin wouldn\u2019t have the guts to ask her to throw her jewellery into the mix.As this has come up too abruptly, Li WangJin hadn\u2019t had the chance to do anything shady. The two of them spent the next two days listing out all of their possessions and properties.Li WangJin said, \u201cI was the one in the wrong after all. Why don\u2019t you take everything other than the company?\u201dEven though it pained him a lot to give up on so much, he needed the money-making company, so that was a decision that he had to make.\u201cI will even give you all the antiques that I had purchased.\u201d In that case, even if words about his affair had gotten out, others would still feel that he was a decent man as he had given Fang JunRong over half of their assets.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Seeing the work of Xu FangWeng would remind me of you. They\u2019d only annoy me. You can keep them. Besides, a decent person shouldn\u2019t take something that others value. As they were your precious collection, it would be wrong for me to take them.\u201dThose were but Li WangJin\u2019s excuses to encroach on their assets. No way Fang JunRong would be the idiot who\u2019d accept that pile of worthless papers.\u201cYou get Ayron Corporation and your collection of paintings; I take the rest. But those two add up to over 24 billion yuan, I will be on the losing end if we divide them up that way. You are, after all, the side who was at fault.\u201d She paused for a bit, then carried on, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this. You pay me another 3 billion yuan on top of that.\u201dShe felt that she was being very kind already and didn\u2019t push the envelope too far. Li WangJin would be able to come up with 3 billion if he tried; he would just be tight for a little while afterward. She recalled a piece of land that they owned. It was in the countryside area currently, but that land would be under development a year from now and be built into two city centers. The value of that real estate would increase by over ten folds.Li WangJin was about to puke blood. He knew very well that if he were to sell his antiques, he would be lucky to get 100 million yuan for them. If they were to divide up their assets that way, he would only be getting a total of 15 billion yuan. That was like scraping off a big chunk of flesh from his body. He couldn\u2019t possibly let that happen.Fang JunRong said coolly, \u201cI don\u2019t like Xu FengWeng\u2019s work because of you. Why don\u2019t we do this? If you insist on me taking them, I\u2019ll hold an auction and convert them all to cash.\u201dWhatever made Li WangJin think that she would want to keep those as keepsakes?Li WangJin froze and blurted out, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d He couldn\u2019t allow those to be appraised by an expert. Once the result came out, there would be nothing left of his reputation.He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cYou are right. I don\u2019t think I can hand over my precious collection. I will compensate you in other ways.\u201dHe was a bit dazed. Whatever had happened? Wasn\u2019t he the one who had planned on transferring out most of their joint assets before he divorced her?He looked up at her. His wife, who has now begun to calm down, seemed so unfamiliar to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could tell that she had her mind set on getting a divorce and not even their son could change her mind.He even thought about calling up their daughter and had her come home. He knew very well that Fang JunRong cared a lot for their daughter, even more so than she did their son. Even though he didn\u2019t care for that, it wouldn\u2019t stop him from leveraging that. Except that every time he tried to call up Li XinYun, her phone was turned off. He was mad and cussed her out many times behind her back. Nevertheless, as he wasn\u2019t able to get hold of her, there also wasn\u2019t much that he could do.He regretted again when he looked at all the assets that would be going to Fang JunRong and couldn\u2019t help but start to blame this on Wang SiXian. If she hadn\u2019t seduced him impatiently, he would not have made that mistaken. He even started questioning whether the wine he had that day was drugged.\u201cAre you sure this is what you want? We have been married for so many years after all\u2026\u201d Looking down at the division of the assets on the divorce decree, he couldn\u2019t help but want to give it one last try.Fang JunRong gave him a cold glance, \u201cCan\u2019t part with your money? Never pegged you as such a bourgeois.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the affection between us that I don\u2019t want to part with.\u201dTo a certain degree, Fang JunRong was impressed by the level of Li WangJin\u2019s shamelessness. How was he still able to shamelessly pretend that he still has feelings for her at this point in time? She only found that disgusting.She curved her lips some. There was a smile on her face, but it was that of piercing coldness. \u201cThen how about you give me all of your possessions to show me how much you love me?\u201dLi WangJin was speechless.Fang JunRong stood up and was done talking to him. \u201cI will see you at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow, unless you want to go up on the most trended search list.\u201dShe didn\u2019t worry that Li WangJin would change his mind. After all, his reputation was very important to him and there was no way he could put up with being the male lead of some pornographic video, especially one that would be passed around domestically.Just to be 100% safe, she prepared an additional gift for Li WangJin.Li WangJin returned to his company feeling vexed and discussed with his trusted aide to see if he might have any good ideas.Zhou Zhi, his subordinate, shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s got you where she wants you. After all, you are the one at fault here, unless madam also made a similar mistake.\u201dHis words were about as suggestive as they could get.Li WangJin tightened his lips some. Even if he no longer has feelings for Fang JunRong, they have, after all, been married for so many years. He had long viewed her as part of his possession. He wouldn\u2019t voluntarily have her cheat on him. No man could stomach that.Besides, Fang JunRong was home right now and she had given him the ultimatum that they would be meeting at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow or he would be going up on the top trended list. With only one day\u2019s time, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make that happen even if he had wanted to.It looked like he would have no choice but to accept the fate of a divorce. Except that he felt so unjust\u2026 so much assets, and most of them should have been his.The more he thought about it, the more unhappy he became.Then his assistant walked in and his bronze-colored skin glowed from excitement.\u201cBoss, I just heard the news that the city government will be developing a new commercial area next year. The new commercial area will be located in the Nanhe District, near our factory.\u201dEven though Ayron\u2019s headquarter was located in the heart of the city, their factory was built in the much cheaper remote area. Plus, they were not a small company, so their factory occupied quite a bit of land.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes beaming and he asked, \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201dZhou Zhi nodded forcefully. \u201cI heard it with my own ears.\u201dLi WangJin paced back and forth and rubbed his hands together excitedly. If this was true, then his company was going to be worth a lot more. They could make at least 6 fold on the cost of that piece of land, thus driving the value of the company up by 30 billion yuan.He asked again, \u201cWhere did you hear that from?\u201d\u201cHe JianBing was having lunch with her friends and I overheard them,\u201d said Zhou Zhi.Li WangJin frowned. \u201cHow could they be so careless?\u201d He had an idea what kind of person He JianBing, his wife\u2019s high school friend, was. She was a careful person and would never share something so important in public.\u201cNo, I only heard it because I had the server bugged the private room that they were in,\u201d said Zhou Zhi. He took a look at Li WangJin. He knew very well that Li WangJin had always wanted to get some insider scoop from the He\u2019s but never had the opportunity.\u201cI paid the server to bug the room.\u201d Zhou Zhi showed no sense of guilt when he said this. He knew that the information was significant enough that his boss would only be proud of his accomplishment instead of frowning upon how he got hold of it.Li WangJin\u2019s brows unfurrowed when he heard that. He felt much more confident about the credibility of the information now. If that was true, that made the share going to Fang JunRong much more stomachable.As long as he could have possession of both their shares on Ayron, he stood to lose nothing. By then, he would never agree to remarry Fang JunRong even if she came and begged him.He patted Zhou Zhi on his shoulder and said happily, \u201cGreat job!\u201dHe had half the heart to stall the timing of the divorce. But now that he had found out about this, his stance had flipped altogether. Now he just wanted to have his divorce as soon as possible so he could pocket all of the profit.That idea occupied his entire mind and he couldn\u2019t help but call up Fang JunRong right away. His voice was high-spirited. \u201cAs you wanted to have a divorce, alright, we will do it first thing tomorrow morning.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s voice, coming from the other end of the phone, was very calm. \u201cMaybe we should reschedule. JianBing asked me out to lunch tomorrow. She said there is something she wanted me to know. We can take care of our divorce day after tomorrow. I am not in any hurry.\u201dLi WangJin\u2019s heart dropped. He felt for sure the piece of news that he had just heard was what He JianBing wanted to share with Fang JunRong. The two of them had always been close. No way. If they dragged this out to the day after tomorrow, Fang JunRong might not be willing to give up on her share of the company. There was no way he would share that profit with her.\u201cNo. Let\u2019s do it tomorrow morning.\u201d He blurted out.\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush all of a sudden? Can\u2019t wait to marry your lover?\u201dWang SiXian was the last thing on his mind right now. He took a deep breath and said, \u201cI just don\u2019t see a point in dragging it out anymore.\u201dHe went on and on with all sorts of reasonings until he was finally able to convince Fang JunRong to meet him on time tomorrow for their divorce. All of a sudden, their stance seemed to have swapped.After he hung up the phone, Li WangJin wiped away the sweat on his forehead. He was a little tired, but he was more excited and emotional. How he wished he could just close his eyes and tomorrow would be here already.***The next day, Fang JunRong had no intention of keeping this on the down low. She didn\u2019t even wear any shades but walked into the Civil Affairs Bureau with Li WangJin openly.The two of them had already signed their divorce decree. The entire process went by seamlessly as they had already reached an agreement beforehand.When Li WangJin saw Fang JunRong sign her name, his heart that had been hung up in the air finally returned to where it was. Having the divorce decree in his hand, he couldn\u2019t help but recall the day of their wedding. It had already been 20 years since that day.He had true feelings for Fang JunRong back then. It was just that his fondness for her had eroded away in front of financial gain. Besides, as long as Fang JunRong was around, everybody would always feel that he was lucky to have married her. Nobody would appreciate his true ability.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet, he had long since gotten into the habit of pretending to be a nice guy in front of Fang JunRong and didn\u2019t want his excitement and eagerness to show. The conflict inside of him made his expression look twisted.He lowered his head. After regaining control of his look, he looked up at Fang JunRong and said, \u201cWould you like a ride to your meeting place with He JianBing?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t contain himself. He wanted to let He JianBing know the news. He never liked He JianBing much. Especially as of late, that woman never even greeted him when she ran into him, as though he was just some accessory that was following Fang JunRong around.Fang JunRong gave him a smile that wasn\u2019t really a smile and said, \u201cWhy not?\u201dLi WangJin happily walked next to Fang JunRong.Fang JunRong was going to meet He JianBing at a Michelin restaurant. When she was almost there, Fang JunRong let He JianBing know to come out to meet her. Looking at Li WangJin, He JianBing gave a very official smile and said, \u201cSo you are divorced now?\u201dLi WangJin nodded. He took a look at Fang JunRong, sighed, and said, \u201cYeah, JunRong couldn\u2019t forgive me.\u201dHe JianBing turned and looked at Fang JunRong, \u201cAll the terms and conditions are the same as before?\u201dFang JunRong acknowledged.He JianBing was very happy all of a sudden and said to Fang JunRong, \u201cCongratulations. The government is going to develop in the Beihu area next year. Your piece of land is going to go up and up in price.\u201dThis news was about to be announced in a few days, so it didn\u2019t matter that she said it out loud. Plus, He JianBing purposefully wanted Li WangJin to hear it.Li WangJin was stunned silent and suspected that there was something wrong with his ears. His lips trembled. \u201cI thought it was the Nanhe District?\u201d How was it Beihu now?He JianBing pursed her lips. \u201cNo. Who told you it was Nanhe?\u201d She pretended that she was trying to recall. \u201cOh, that reminds me. I might have mistakenly told my friend that it was Nanhe when we were talking about it previously. I better give him a call to clarify.\u201dShe looked over at Li WangJin. \u201cBut how did you know about this? Who told you?\u201dLi WangJin was in no mood to answer her question. All he could think of was the piece of land in Beihu was about to go up in price. He didn\u2019t even care about all those properties at the time and just casually signed them all over to Fang JunRong without even trying to haggle with her.The sudden news shocked Li WangJin so much that he thought his soul would be shattered. Dazed, he kept on repeating to himself, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible\u201d, \u201cHow could that be?\u201d He was in shock and wished that this was all but a dream.Fang JunRong gave Li WangJin a very sincere look and said, \u201cAye, too bad we have already divorced and that land no longer has anything to do with you.\u201d She waved the divorce decree in her hand at him.\u201cI was going to go get the divorce after my lunch with JianBing, but you didn\u2019t want to wait at all.\u201d Of course, that was all because He JianBing was willing to work with her. It would never have gone so smoothly otherwise.\u201cI guess it just wasn\u2019t meant to be. Sometimes that\u2019s just how things are. Don\u2019t worry. I will make sure I do a good job with that piece of land.\u201dHer cheerful voice turned into the last straw on the camel\u2019s back to Li WangJin.She took one last look at the devastated Li WangJin and walked inside the restaurant with He JianBing. It\u2019d be one thing had he not known about it at all. But just one day\u2019s difference, and he would have been able to have a substantially greater share of wealth. That news was devastating to Li WangJin.Li WangJin gave Fang JunRong a deadly stare from behind her. Thinking about the piece of land that he had just missed out, he was about to vomit blood.Why didn\u2019t he just wait a couple of days to get a divorce? Why?! How was it that He JianBing just happened to misspoke about the location? Could he blame He JianBing? No! It was his assistant who was listening in on their conversation and got the wrong information that led to his demise.Suddenly, he saw black and his body started to fall backward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I must say I am very impressed.\u201d Fang JunRong said she was going to get a divorce and she did, just like that. There was no muddling of things or dragging things out. He JianBing truly found that impressive. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that herself. Her and her husband\u2019s families benefited a lot from their union, so even if there were no more feelings between the two of them, she couldn\u2019t just up and leave like that.She might not be able to do it herself, but she was willing to help her friend out and provide her with the support that she needed. Not to mention the fact that Fang JunRong had given her a heads-up previously and she was able to dodged the bullet of being set up by Wang Xiao. She was always willing to repay her the favor.***Fang JunRong was in a pretty good mood after her successful divorce. Those she had planted in the company previously had resigned after transitioning off their work and switched over to her Meifang, a skin-care product company. Naturally, she would treat her people well. Everybody received a 10% raise.Looking at the assets under her name, Fang JunRong felt that she had never been that wealthy her entire life.Speaking of, all the real estate properties that they had purchased over the years, including the large mansion that they were currently staying in, had gone to Fang JunRong. Li WangJin and Jiang YaGe should be moving out. She wasn\u2019t sure whether Li WangJin had forgotten or that it was intentional, but it had been two days since the divorce and they were showing no signs of getting ready to move out.As for Li ShiZe, he didn\u2019t have that kind of self-awareness at all. After all, in his mind, even though his parents had divorced, they were still his parents. It only made sense that he would continue to stay where he was.Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t be bothered to evict them. It wasn\u2019t worth it for her to hurt her bearings for these individuals. Besides, she wasn\u2019t all that attached to this house anyway. In her previous life, she was sent to the mental institution from this house whereas Li ShiZe and Jiang YaGe continued to live their happy lives in that grandeur house.Even though those days were gone, every time she thought about it, it felt like a fish bone that was stuck in her throat. All the servants at the house sided with Li WangJin and the others, especially after the arrival of Jiang YaGe. They had quickly grown fond of Jiang YaGe. Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t stupid enough to still keep this batch of employees after her divorce. Naturally, they would all go with Li WangJin.She told Zhong Yi and moved hers, Zhong Yi\u2019s, and her daughter\u2019s belongings to a new house. The new house wasn\u2019t as big as their mansion, but it was still two-story. More than sufficient for the three of them plus their servants. She quickly hired a new chauffeur, chefs, hourly domestic help, and bodyguards, and she was set. These people were on her payroll and naturally would be loyal to her.She hired a total of five bodyguards. Being rebirthed, she was very cautious with her life.Fang JunRong did not acknowledge Jiang YaGe as her daughter, but Zhong Yi was hand picked by her and she acknowledged her. Zhong Yi worried that Fang JunRong would be in a foul mood initially, so she took some time off to keep her company at home. Nonetheless, even a blind person could tell that Fang JunRong had been quite cheerful since the divorce. She seemed like she almost wanted to whistle every day. That made Zhong Yi feel better.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After finding out about the affair between Jiang YaGe\u2019s aunt and Li WangJin, she did not believe that Jiang YaGe was entirely innocent in all this. She had gone from friends to strangers with Jiang YaGe.By now, Li XinYun, who had been traveling, had returned. Afterall, her birthday was getting close. She received the news of her parents\u2019 divorce immediately after her return, and she was stunned.Even though she preferred her mother to her father and that she had some rough time with her father as of late, that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to see her parents divorced.Seeing her dazed look, Fang JunRong\u2019s heart ached as she stroked her daughter on her face. She had no intention of covering up for Li WangJin and told Li XinYun everything. She did not, however, show her the video. There was no need for her to see that.Li XinYun bit her lip, and there was anger amidst her being dazed still. \u201cHow could dad do that? How could he betray you? Why didn\u2019t you tell me then?\u201dAfter finding out about her father\u2019s behaviors, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say that her parents should not have gotten a divorce. She was at the age of thinking about romance fondly, so no way she would find cheating acceptable.\u201cYou were having fun overseas and I didn\u2019t want to spoil your mood,\u201d said Fang JunRong. Plus, she didn\u2019t want Li WangJin to drag this out using XinYun as an excuse. She specifically had those around XinYun take her out at the time. Preferably, she would have so many things to do that she wouldn\u2019t even think about what was going on at home.\u201cWhat about big brother? What did he say about all this?\u201dFang JunRong had no intention to make Li ShiZe appeared better than he actually was in her daughter\u2019s mind. She told Li XinYun everything. Besides, she didn\u2019t want Li XinYun still has any expectations about her brother.Li Jinyuan was about to go mad from anger. Li ShiZe was two years her senior and had always been more outstanding and more mature than her. She had always looked up to her brother deep down inside. She hadn\u2019t expected that her brother would take Jiang YaGe\u2019s side on this matter. Anyone with eyes could see Jiang YaGe couldn\u2019t be completely innocent in this.She bit her bottom lip and said, \u201cLet me go talk to him!\u201dThen she dashed out like a bullet; her luggage still sitting in the living room.Fang JunRong had the chauffeur and a bodyguard follow her. She wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to her daughter.Li XinYun returned after three hours. Her eyes looked much puffier than before. She had obviously cried.Seeing Fang JunRong, Li XinYun pouted and said in a wronged voice, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them anymore.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s heart ached, but she also knew that it was necessary to shatter that image that XinYun had for them. They would otherwise use her love for them to take advantage of her.\u201cYou won\u2019t need to. You have me.\u201dLi XinYun sniffled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see them at my birthday banquet.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will tell them to not come.\u201d Fang JunRong was very agreeable.She spent quite a bit of time with her daughter before she finally left her room when XinYun went to bed.She said to Zhong Yi, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you spend some more time with XinYun in the next few days? She had always liked you.\u201d Plus, they were close in age and had more in common.Zhong Yi nodded. \u201cI will.\u201dShe was appreciative toward her adopted mother. If it wasn\u2019t for her, she would still be working at White Crane and put up with the risks of being groped. And, as she no longer needed to worry about medical fees, her grandmother\u2019s situation had stabilized.In her eyes, her adopted mother was a benefactor to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to the chauffeur, XinYun ran into Li ShiZe and Jiang YaGe when she arrived. Their body language was pretty intimate. After Fang JunRong was gone, they no longer had anything else to worry about and acted like lovers normally.XinYun was infuriated and scolded Jiang YaGe until she was tearful, only to be yelled at by Li ShiZe. She then went to look for Li WangJin at his company only to learn that Li WangJin was helping Jiang YaGe out by contemplating about making her Li ShiZe\u2019s assistant.Naturally, Li XinYun got into a fight with her father. Li WangJin dared not yell at Fang JunRong but not so much in front of his daughter. So Li XinYun was yelled at again.Fang JunRong\u2019s look darkened. Her daughter that she had treasured was not treasured by that father and son duo. In fact, they were dreadful to her. Whatever she\u2019d do to them now would be justified. She must get even with them for her daughter.She gave the order to slip some information about Jiang YaGe to Wang Xiao and also hired an agent to start the process of putting the mansion onto the market.She didn\u2019t want to live there anymore, but that didn\u2019t mean she would let the others continue to stay there. Her best option was to sell it.***Jiang YaGe had been studying hard at home these last few days. She was going to be Li ShiZe\u2019s assistant during the remaining time of summer vacation. She worried that she would be looked down upon if she wasn\u2019t familiar with the work.She didn\u2019t want others to think that she only got the position because she pulled strings, so she thought she\u2019d do some preparation work ahead of time. She should at least know how to work with data and print them out. Li ShiZe, too, stayed home to help bring her up to speed.Jiang YaGe\u2019s occasional looks of admiration stroked his ego very much.Their relationship had been growing leaps and bounds ever since Li ShiZe had stood up for her in front of his mother. Needless to say, Li ShiZe was perfect in Jiang YaGe\u2019s eyes. His look was one in a million. He was competent and successful. And, most importantly, he was willing to stand up and defend her when necessary, not the kind of mommy\u2019s boys that she has always heard of from her friends.In order to show her appreciation for Li ShiZe, Jiang YaGe decided to show him her best side \u2013 cooking a good dinner for both her adopted father and Li ShiZe.Even though Li WangJin was still very upset about the piece of land over at Beihu District, when Jiang YaGe called him with her voice filled with anticipation, he had no heart to turn her down. Not only did he go home early, he even brought with him a few bottles of expensive red wines.Jiang YaGe tried to make western food that night. When she was working at the club, she would sometimes take cooking lessons from the chefs. She was going to make venison with mushroom and berries dish. Dessert would be rum baba.Li ShiZe was used to cooking of professional chefs. As talented as Jiang YaGe might be, she still didn\u2019t measure up to a professional. Li ShiZe, nonetheless, praised how dexterous she was. His praising words put stars in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had it a few times and recognized it as such. The smile on him lessened.His voice was calm. \u201cI don\u2019t like this dish very much. Don\u2019t make it too often in the future.\u201d He didn\u2019t like all the ties that she had with the club.Jiang YaGe paused for a second and had a hurtful look on her.Normally, Jiang YaGe only has this look when she is around others. Back then, Li WangJin always felt that she had been wronged and would stand up for her. Now that she was using it on him, that made him somewhat unhappy. Hasn\u2019t he been nice enough to her?Jiang YaGe only did that reflexively. When she noticed the look on Li WangJin, she immediately tried to patch things up. \u201cI guess this is not your type of food. I will change. It\u2019s my fault. I should have consulted with you beforehand.\u201dHer voice was soft and she had brought herself down to a very low position. Li WangJin\u2019s displeasure was immediately blown away like there was a breeze. Immediately, the atmosphere returned to warm and pleasant.Unfortunately, a warmth scene like that was meant to be disturbed. The security informed Li WangJin through the intercom that the buyers were here to look at the house.Li WangJin was baffled. \u201cWhat buyers?\u201dAs baffled as he was, he had always been conscious of his reputation to the public, so he let them in nonetheless. He was surprised when he saw the people who walked in. The visitors were Boss Zhao in the timber business and his wife. They have met before. Deep down inside, Li WangJin looked down upon nouveau riche such as Boss Zhao.Putting on a perfect smile, he asked, \u201cWhat brought you here to look at the house, Boss Zhao. Are you thinking about purchasing something similar?\u201dBy now, he had completely forgotten that this mansion technically belonged to Fang JunRong, and none of them were entitled to remain here anymore.Boss Zhao looked around and looked pleased. \u201cNo, I am here to look at this mansion. I plan to buy it.\u201dLi WangJin frowned, and his voice chilled a little. \u201cI am sorry. We are very happy with this mansion and have no intention to sell it.\u201dBoss Zhao smiled at him. There was a certain profoundness in his smile. \u201cBut from what I have heard, this mansion now belongs to your ex-wife, Boss Fang. I heard that the two of you had divorced. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d still be staying here.\u201d He paused for a second and carried on. \u201cI caught wind in our circle that Boss Fang intends to sell this house. Is it Boss Li\u2019s intention to buy it from her? I heard it was a bit on the pricey end, but if that\u2019s your intention, then it\u2019d be wrong for me to fight you over it.\u201dOf course, Li WangJin couldn\u2019t possibly buy this. He had pretty much handed over all his liquid capital over to Fang JunRong. He had at most 10 million yuan that was fluid right now. He had no choice but to say, \u201cWe will be moving shortly.\u201dHaving the fact that the house belonged to Fang JunRong pointed out to him was especially embarrassing. Particularly when Boss Zhao gave him the he was leeching-off-of-his-ex-wife look.Boss Zhao\u2019s wife toured the place and rejoined him. She asked \u201cHow long would it take you to move out? Is one day enough?\u201dFang JunRong had told them that the sooner they move in, the bigger the discount she\u2019d give them. As rich as they may be, a mansion like this cost upward of hundreds of million yuan. Any savings would be significant.Li WangJin was so angry that his face turned a green hue. They couldn\u2019t wait to kick him out, as though he was nothing but trash. That hurt his ego deeply.\u201cNot even that. We will move right now,\u201d said Li WangJin coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were a lot of things inside the mansion, and it would take a lot of time and effort to pack.Even though Jiang YaGe had only been there for a month, as Li WangJin and Li ShiZe were both exceptionally fond of her, they had bought her a lot of stuff already. And they were all pricey items that she dared not have the servants help out, worried that they\u2019d take a few with them. She had no choice but to do it all by herself. She was hot and sweaty, and her jade-perfect face was covered in dust. Covered in grime, she no longer looked as vibrant as she normally was.Luckily, Li WangJin and Li ShiZe were more or less in the same position with each of them being worse than the other, so nobody was picking on anyone else. The two men only have more to pack up than Jiang YaGe. All of them kept themselves busy until almost midnight, especially when they had a point to make and wanted to move out right away.Now they\u2019d need to look for a hotel to stay at at midnight. In addition, they needed to settle the servants and arrange for hotel rooms for them as well. All these grunt work added together made them even more annoyed and wished they could just drop everything and stopped working.Li WangJin hated his ex-wife even more. He was certain that Fang JunRong did this to them intentionally. She could have reminded them to move out and not embarrassed them like so. He chose to ignore that fact that he was the one who ignored the reality that they needed to move and chose to stay there instead.Staying in a hotel for an extended amount of time wasn\u2019t a solution either. Nevermind that staying in a hotel wasn\u2019t as comfortable as staying in one\u2019s own home. Should the words get out, others would think that he couldn\u2019t even afford a house and that would make him lose face.Ideally, Li WangJin would like to buy a house no worse than their previous one. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have a lot of liquid cash and he couldn\u2019t possibly sell more of the company\u2019s stock. He didn\u2019t care for smaller houses that he could afford currently. Not to mention that it wouldn\u2019t be able to house all of their servants. For someone who was used to his level of comfort, he surely wouldn\u2019t let any of the servants go.Finally, Li ShiZe had to spend his own money to buy a big house, and they were finally able to have a place to stay. As it was so last minute, they ended up spending 10% over market price. Plus, Li ShiZe was also one that was used to a certain level of comfort and would not live in anything worse than what he was used to. In the end, he had spent almost all of his savings.Li WangJin was glad that at least his son was on his side.They had only moved in there for just two days when Jiang YaGe apologetically brought her aunty Wang SiXian over.\u201cShiZe, I am so sorry. I know you don\u2019t like my aunty and that she had her faults, but she was kicked out of the place that she was staying at and had nowhere to go. Can she stay with us for a few days? She will move out as soon as she gets her own place.\u201cShe is my only family and the one that mother worried about before she passed away. I can\u2019t not watch out for her.\u201dJiang YaGe felt very unjust. She didn\u2019t want to take care of her aunty, but her aunty threatened her that if she didn\u2019t help her out, she\u2019d exposed to ShiZe that Jiang YaGe had always known about the relationship between her adopted father and herself. Jiang YaGe had no choice but to do as she was told.Naturally, Li ShiZe did not like that idea. His parents would not have had the divorce if it wasn\u2019t for Wang SiXian. But, looking at the remorse and sadness on Jiang YaGe, he finally gave in.\u201cBut she better not let me run into her inside the house,\u201d said Li ShiZe coldly. He did like Jiang YaGe a lot, but he, too, has his own principles.Jiang YaGe quickly gave him her promise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As Fang JunRong had sold their house on purpose and gave them such a difficult time, he also wanted to use the presence of Wang SiXian to get back at her and hurt her feelings.As much as Fang JunRong acted like she wanted nothing else to do with him, if he didn\u2019t have a spot in her heart, how\u2019d she reacted so greatly to his having an affair and escalated things all the way to a divorce? As the saying goes, the deeper the love, the deeper the hatred.In addition to letting Wang SiXian move in with them, he treated Jiang YaGe even better. He showered her with all of his fatherly love and bought her many things. He gave her 200,000 yuan pocket money every month, so she could buy anything that she wanted. According to her, that\u2019s the proper way to raise a girl.As for his real daughter, Li XinYun, he had completely neglected her and never brought her up again. And that\u2019s how Jiang YaGe finally experienced what a truly luxurious life of being a wealthy girl was like.His behaviors had no impact whatsoever on Fang JunRong, but it had utterly infuriated Wang Xiao.Wang Xiao had visited a lot of doctors recently, hoping to fix his hand. Unfortunately, nothing worked. Not only could he not overly exhaust his left hand, many times, it\u2019d give in suddenly and cups had fallen out of his hand in more than one occurrence.That had given him an explosive temperament, and he had taken it out on those around him quite often.Every time there was something wrong with his hand, he\u2019d think about Jiang YaGe, that woman who was responsible for him becoming half a crippled person.When he found out that Jiang YaGe\u2019s life had become even better than before and that her status had even risen over the real young miss Li XinYun, he was infuriated. He was suffering all sorts of hardships on his end and tried all sorts of methods to no avail, but Jiang YaGe was lucky and happy and there were no consequences whatsoever? How was he supposed to be okay with that?Wang Xiao had always been a vindictive person. He wasn\u2019t going to let Jiang YaGe off the hook so easily. Previously, owing to Fang JunRong, he only dared pulling some small stunts on Li WangJin and nothing serious. Now that Fang JunRong had divorced Li WangJin and taken most of their assets and Li WangJin was just hurting, Wang Xiao no longer has much to worry about.A ruthless look appeared on his face and he said to his underlings, \u201cI want Jiang YaGe to regret being alive in three days\u2019 time. And that Li WangJin, let him know what it meant to have offended me.\u201dHis voice was cold like ice in December, mixed with deeply rooted hatred.***As soon as Wang Xiao\u2019s revenge started, Li WangJin\u2019s bad luck had begun. Lots of trouble-makers showed up at his workplace. Sometimes their windows were smashed; sometimes he\u2019d accidentally fall into a ditch as he was walking down the street. All the ones who had previously picked on him maliciously had started all over again. They came and went without a trace and he couldn\u2019t figure out why these were happening to him.Even though Li WangJin had contacted the police time and again, all his efforts were in vain. He was both annoyed and worried at the same time. He didn\u2019t know how far they would go and whether his life would be in danger next time. Li WangJin valued his life quite a bit. So he resorted to spending quite a bit of money and hired a few bodyguards for himself to always check out the areas around him.He now regretted divorcing Fang JunRong too soon. Fang JunRong had a much better network than he did. But that was no point in regretting now. All he could do was to hire more people to look into the matters for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Naturally, he didn\u2019t think that was a big deal. Of course he\u2019d pay him back when the company turned a profit.When he had everything arranged, the incidents seemed to have died down around him. Under his heightened surveillance activities, incidents such as windows being smashed had finally stopped. Li WangJin let out a sigh of relief. He thought the issue had finally come to pass and that the other party had already given up. And that all there was left to do was to find out who was behind it out. Unexpectedly, an incident happened on Jiang YaGe\u2019s end.Jiang YaGe has had some really relaxing days lately, and she had been smiling a lot more. Without Fang JunRong and Li XinYun in the house, she had become the woman of the house and was the center of attention. Under that atmosphere, she had become more and more outgoing and would go out and shop for herself from time to time.This was the day she had learned that one of her favorite designers had just released a new purse and she couldn\u2019t wait to bring her aunt along with her to go shopping at the mall. She couldn\u2019t wait to bring it to school after she had purchased it. Just the thought of all the envious looks for her classmates was enough to make her steps cheerful. She felt like she was walking on cloud nine.The incident took place when they had gotten out of their car.Wang SiXian, her arm in Jiang YaGe\u2019s, was about to walk over to the elevator. Right then, someone jumped out of a van next to them. His head was wrapped tight in fabric, exposing nothing other than his eyes. His gloved hands quickly twisted open a bottle, and he splashed the content toward Jiang YaGe.At the very moment, Jiang YaGe, in her high heels, stumbled and fell on the ground, bringing Wang SiXian with her. The fluid, aimed at Jiang YaGe, had already left the bottle and was too late to be retrieved, landed mostly on Wang SiXian who happened to block in front of Jiang YaGe.The abrasiveness of the fluid spread in the air and the person quickly got back into the van and took off before anyone could react to what had happened. His movement was so smooth and coordinated and obviously had been well planned out. A woman\u2019s scream cut through the air and pierced into everyone\u2019s eardrum.Wang SiXian\u2019s voice was filled with agony. \u201cMy face! It hurts!\u201dThe pain that was now spreading on her skin made her roll around on the ground while letting out bone-chilling shrieks one after another. Jiang YaGe flared much better than her. None of the fluid landed on her skin. Just a few splattered on her jacket that was used to block the sun and burned a few holes in it. She was lucky that she worried about the air-conditioning at the mall and had worn an extra layer. Otherwise, the fluid would have come into contact with her skin. She had heard about incidents where people were splashed with acid on the news in the past but had always thought that was something very far away and would never happen anywhere near her.She quickly removed her jacket and scrambled up from the ground. She took a few steps back, and her face was pale. It was so close. Her face was almost ruined. She replayed the earlier scene in her hand and suddenly realized something.No. That acid was aimed at her. Her aunt was just the innocent bystander. Had she not stumbled right then and there, she would have been the one on the receiving end of the acid.Who was it that hated her so much that they wanted her face ruined?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were discussing about projects that the two companies would be working together on during the remainder of the year.When they were mostly done with the discussion, Li WangJin was finally able to unfurrow his brows \u2013 so many awful things had happened recently and now finally he had something good to look forward to. If they could seal this deal, he would be able to come across a sizable amount of cash. He was getting tired of life on a shoestring budget.Boss Zhou, who was five years older than Li WangJin, smiled and said, \u201cA new club has opened up recently. Let\u2019s go check it out.\u201dHe winked at Li WangJin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone telling what you can or cannot do anymore. Might as well go enjoy yourself, eh?\u201dA fleeting look of embarrassment crossed Li WangJin\u2019s face. Alteration of stock ownership structure was no small feat, so more or less everyone in their circle knew about his divorce. As Fang JunRong had dirt on him, Li WangJin didn\u2019t dare to create an image of himself being a great husband. He only said that there were irreconcilable differences.He cleared his throat and said, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go take a look then.\u201dIn the past, he worried about Fang JunRong, so he never did more than drinking and watching a show when he visited clubs and nothing else. That wasn\u2019t easy. Now he could finally fully enjoy himself.However, as soon as he stood up, a call came in. Jiang YaGe\u2019s names flashed nonstop on the screen. If it was anyone else, Li WangJin would not have picked it up. But Jiang YaGe was not the same.Was she bullied by XinYun? That was his first thought when he quickly picked up the call.\u201cWhat? Sixian was hurt? What happened?\u201d His volume went up uncontrollably. He only lowered his voice again when he noticed everybody around him and turned to look at him. Comforting Jiang YaGe on the other end of the call, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I will be right over.\u201dAfter he had hung up the phone, he gave Boss Zhang an apologetic look and said, \u201cI am sorry. Something came up. I will join you next time.\u201dThen he added, \u201cMy treat next time!\u201dBoss Zhang waved his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s no problem.\u201d Then he couldn\u2019t help but get curious. \u201cSomething happened to your little lover.\u201dLi WangJin\u2019s look froze, and he looked embarrassed. \u201cNo, no such thing. I don\u2019t have a lover.\u201d\u201cEverybody knows about it. You divorced your ex-wife for that Wang SiXian,\u201d said Boss Zhang.\u201cYou know that Wang SiXian is not that young anymore. And she looks just okay. Kind of plain if you ask me. It wasn\u2019t worth it to divorce your wonderful wife for her.\u201d What Boss Zhang didn\u2019t want to tell him was that everybody thought he had lost his mind for doing that.\u201cEven her body is just alright in the video. It\u2019s not like she has a big chest or big bottom.\u201dLi WangJin almost coughed out a mouthful of black blood. His hand shook. \u201cWho told you that? Was it Fang JunRong?\u201dHow dare she do that? He had given her so much when it came to splitting of their assets. And she had promised him that she would not show the video to anyone else. Which was why he was able to tell others that they had split over irreconcilable differences. And now, all the reputation that he had built up over the years were gone.Thinking about all the people that were talking about him behind his back, Li WangJin\u2019s mind went blank and he started to sweat.Boss Zhang shook his head. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t her. Your ex-wife is truly a good person. She has never said one bad word about you. Oh, I heard it from Sun Mei.\u201dHe saw that Li WangJin wasn\u2019t looking very well and that he looked like he could just pass out any minute. Not wanting to take the blame, he told Li WangJin everything that he knew. Everybody in their circle had already heard about it, which was why he assumed that Li WangJin knew about it as well.\u201cSun Mei even said that she was the one who gave the video to your ex-wife. Nobody knew how she got hold of it in the first place.\u201dLi WangJin\u2019s face was twisted. If only Sun Mei was in front of him right now, he would most certainly jump and beat her up. He has never had any respect for Sun Mei. She was narrow-minded and a sh*t-stirrer. He never thought that she would be the one who ruined him.Had he known, he would never have offended her in the first placeThere had been too many little things going on lately that had taken away all of his attention, which was why he had no idea about this at all. Under normal circumstances, not very many people would have said it out loud in front of him like this Boss Zhang just did.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen he arrived at the hospital, Li WangJin was still dazed and focused on thinking about how to salvage his reputation. He was startled from those thoughts when he saw Wang SiXian\u2019s face that was now destroyed by strong acid.Her face was ferocious like that of a beast who was waving its claws and baring its fangs at him. That image was burned into his brain.He quickly looked away and couldn\u2019t look at Wang SiXian, who was still unconscious, any more. He asked Jiang YaGe in a low voice, \u201cWhat happened to your aunt? Why would someone splash her with acid for no reason?\u201dJiang YaGe had been crying for a while now. Sobbing, she recounted the incident at the parking garage to him. Looking at Li WangJin through her teary eyes, she said, \u201cDad, Aunty has been away from this country for dozens of years. Why would this happen to her right after she had returned?\u201cWas someone targeting us intentionally? But we have always been so nice to anyone and never made any enemies.\u201d As though she had thought of something, she said. \u201cUnless it was Mom\u2026 No, that can\u2019t be. I trust that she isn\u2019t that kind of a person.\u201d Jiang YaGe immediately tried to save herself. Except her look didn\u2019t reflect what she had said. It was obvious that she was suspicious of Fang JunRong.Li WangJin knew very well in his mind. He shook his head. \u201cIt won\u2019t be JunRong. She\u2019s prideful and would never do such a thing. She wouldn\u2019t stoop that low.\u201dHe did, after all, know his ex-wife quite well. He suspected that the one who splashed Wang SiXian with acid was the same person as the one who had been causing him trouble lately. The thought of someone hiding in the dark trying to hurt him made his hair stand up.Li WangJin stayed for a bit at the hospital. According to the doctor, Wang SiXian\u2019s injury was not life-threatening. But the damage to her skin reached 5% and was relatively deep. Even after a few surgeries, she would not recover 100% and that damage to her look was inevitable.Thinking about what the face that once resembled Wang SiEr looked like after the accident, Li WangJin felt that it was like bugs crawling all over a beautiful flower. His stomach roiled, and his mood was bad. He could only ask the doctor to do everything within his ability to treat Wang SiXian, regardless of cost.After a period of time, Wang SiXian finally woke up and cried when she saw her appearance in the mirror.Grabbing onto Li WangJin\u2019s hand, she could no longer retain her usual tenderness. Screaming at the top of her lungs, she said, \u201cWangJin, help me! I don\u2019t want to live with this appearance!\u201dHer damaged face made Li WangJin\u2019s stomach turn. He looked away and tried to free his hand from her grip. \u201cI have the doctor arrange surgeries for you already.\u201dHis look of disgust did not escape Wang SiXian. She was close to breaking down. The only thing that she has to rely on was her resemblance to her sister. But now that was all ruined. She had planned to touch Li WangJin with her tenderness so she could, one day, become the wife of the CEO of Ayron. Now it is all over!Li WangJin\u2019s attitude was the last straw on the camel\u2019s back. \u201cWas it Fang JunRong? How could she do that to me? That was so ruthless of her!\u201dWang SiXian was, after all, related to Jiang YaGe.Li WangJin sighed and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it was JunRong. Why don\u2019t you get some rest first? I promise I will find out who the culprit was.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t doing that just for them, but also for himself. Today, it was Wang SiXian who was splashed with acid, it could be him on another day. But Wang SiXian\u2019s words had given him an idea.\u201cLet me go talk to JunRong first.\u201dEven though Fang JunRong might not be the one behind this but, if he talked to her nicely, she just might offer to help him look into this. He didn\u2019t like it, but he must admit that he needed the Fang JunRong\u2019s network in looking into this matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What made him think it was okay for him to come to her for that?\u201c\u2026 SiXian was badly injured. The doctor said her face is ruined. If words got out, many would think that you were the one who was behind it,\u201d said Li WangJin in the most caring way. \u201cEven though we are already divorced, our relationship has been amicable. I still think of you as a friend, so I\u2019d hate to see others spreading untruthful rumors about you. So what do you say if we look into this together?\u201dFang JunRong almost busted out laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to goad me. Whoever dare spread untruthful rumors about me will receive letters from my lawyer.\u201dThe thought of Wang Xiao getting revenge had crossed Fang JunRong\u2019s mind in the past, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to resort to strong acid right away. And this time, it was Wang SiXian who was the victim instead of Jiang YaGe.Looking back into her previous life, after Jiang YaGe started dating her BBQ-pork son, she continued to be good friends with the film emperor. That had enraged many of his fans and finally led to one of them trying to splash acid onto her. Except that one time, it was XinYun who ended up being the victim.As that girl was an acquaintance of XinYun, everybody took Jiang YaGe\u2019s side and expressed that XinYun deserved it because she failed to pick friends carefully. Everybody sided with the crying Jiang YaGe. The way they put it, all XinYun lost was her look, but Jiang YaGe\u2019s injury was on her heart.Now that Wang SiXian had become the victim instead, she felt somewhat better.Li WangJin was still working on trying to convince her. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t want to offend everyone. That would be bad for your reputation.\u201d\u201cWhy do I need a good reputation with these people?\u201d asked Fang JunRong nonchalantly.With her not caring what he was saying, Li WangJin\u2019s original confidence when he came to her was all gone. He resorted to reverse psychology. \u201cAre you so reluctant in helping me with this because you are the one who did it?\u201d Then he suddenly remembered another issue. \u201cHow come Sun Mei has that video clip? Did she get it from you?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019d I know how Sun Mei came across the video? Her and I are not that close. But I owe her one on this. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I\u2019d still be fooled by you to this day.\u201dLi WangJin was fresh out of ideas. He was so angry that he clenched his fists, but there was nothing he could do about Fang JunRong.Fang JunRong\u2019s lips curved up sarcastically. \u201cI thought you came to look for me because of XinYun\u2019s birthday which is in two days. It looks like you had already forgotten about it completely. Since you don\u2019t care about XinYun, I don\u2019t want either you or your son to show up at her birthday banquet either.\u201dThe two of them being there would only upset XinYun.Li WangJin was going to say something else, but Fang JunRong cut him off. \u201cIf you and Li ShiZe stay away from the birthday banquet, I might be able to point you in the right direction.\u201dLi WangJin hesitated for a while and finally made up his mind. \u201cOkay, tell me.\u201dFang JunRong snickered. Sure enough. His daughter meant nothing to him.Her look turned cold and she said, \u201cYou can start by looking into Wang Xiao. I looked into the incident when you were splashed with feces and that had eventually led me to him.\u201dShe went on to give him a brief introduction of Wang Xiao. Truth was, even if Li WangJin hadn\u2019t showed up, she would have found a way to get this clue over to him anyway. She didn\u2019t exactly want to see Wang Xiao getting away scot-free either; it\u2019s best to let the two of them duke it out.Li WangJin was dumbfounded. \u201cWang Xiao? What had I ever done to him?\u201d He had met Wang Xiao maybe once at the most. And he was amicable with him when they met.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask YaGe. Your precious daughter has done something awful to him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Li WangJin was stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He never expected that it all had to do with Jiang YaGe. YaGe was so pure and tender. How could it be possible that she had offended a ruthless person like Wang Xiao?But an incident involving strong acid couldn\u2019t be committed by just anyone. If it was Wang Xiao, that made much more sense.\u201cThat you\u2019d have to ask her. I think it was something like she had caused him injuries to his hand and he\u2019s a very vindictive person, so we became victims by proxy.\u201d She looked at Li WangJin sarcastically. \u201cNow that everyone knows that we have been divorced and you take Jiang YaGe with you everywhere you go, of course he\u2019d target you for revenge.\u201dWang Xiao was still the same man as the one in her memories. He was ruthless and thought of himself as above the law. Now he has even gone as far as splashing acid on someone. If they could nail him for that, that\u2019d ensure a few years of prison sentence for him and have him answer to the law.Li WangJin knew his ex-wife fairly well. If she only had an inkling about Wang Xiao, she would never have mentioned anything about him. She must be at least 80% certain it was him.The thought of Jiang YaGe having made such a ruthless man their enemy made Li WangJin feel that there was a thorn in his back. He didn\u2019t want to continue this conversation with Fang JunRong and left shortly thereafter.Now that he has a specific target, the investigation went much smoother. In addition, Wang Xiao\u2019s man was just the same as him, arrogant and not low-key. He only had to feed them a little bit of extra alcohol before he found out everything he needed to know.Over the years, Li WangJin had rarely ever been in this predicament, especially being victimized by someone of the younger generation. He was so angry that his teeth hurt. But he was a scheming person. He didn\u2019t jump on it right away but waited to collect more evidence against Wang Xiao.After he had received accurate information, he returned to the hospital to visit Wang SiXian and Jiang YaGe. Jiang YaGe had spent the entire night at the hospital keeping Wang SiXian company. As she had been up all night, her eyes were red like those of a rabbit and her skin did not glow like it normally did. She even had a pimple on her chin, making her look very haggard.Seeing Li WangJin, her eyes beamed. \u201cDad, did you find out who did it?\u201d In her mind, her adopted father was very mighty.Wang SiXian gave Li WangJin the exact same look.Li WangJin took in a deep breath and said, \u201cIt was Wang Xiao.\u201dWang SiXian was expecting to hear \u201cFang JunRong\u201d, but the name that came from Li WangJin was one that she had never heard before. There was confusion amidst her anger. \u201cWho is Wang Xiao and why did he want to do this to me?\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s face turned from white to green and her pupil dilated silently. Wang Xiao\u2019s sinister and ruthless look that he gave her before he left popped into her mind all of a sudden, and she shuddered. There was helplessness and fear in her voice. \u201cHow could it be him? Are you sure it was him?\u201dObserving her reaction, Li WangJin had a complex feeling inside of him. \u201cYes, it was him.\u201dSo much had happened to him recently, and he had subsequently spent so much time and money on it that he had become the laughingstock in his circle. He had always assumed that it was him who had offended someone inadvertently. It turned out that all of the misfortunate events that had befallen on him was caused by the simple and kind looking Jiang YaGe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li WangJin, after all the recent hardship, had temporarily forgotten about the affection he had for her. He couldn\u2019t suppress the anger in his voice. \u201cWhat have you done to him that he\u2019d want to do such a thing?\u201dHe has, after all, been in an authoritative position for dozens of years. Li WangJin looked very gentle normally, but when he was angry, it looked like he could burn her to ashes with his look alone.Jiang YaGe, seeing him like that for the first time, almost started crying. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t do it on purpose! I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so vindictive. I really didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201dShe had only wanted to save him at first. She had no idea how they ended up where they were. Jiang YaGe felt on a subconscious level that things should not have come down this way.\u201cI am sorry, Dad. It was all my fault.\u201dCrying silently, she was drowned by both guilt and fear. On one hand, she felt guilty that she had brought about injuries to those around her; on the other hand, she worried that Wang Xiao would make another move on her and she was also worried that her adopted father would give up on her.The Li WangJin in the past would have stood on her side as soon as he saw her tears. Perhaps, he had been seeing too many tears from her recently. He started having some immunity toward her tears. Now they just made him feel exhausted.\u201cYou mean this was your fault? That strong acid was meant for you?\u201d Sometime during their conversation, Wang SiXian had woken up. She looked like she was about to have a breakdown. \u201cIf it was your fault, why am I the victim of it?\u201d\u201cGive me back my face!\u201d The pain of losing her looks had destroyed Wang SiXian\u2019s rationality and made her scream at Jiang YaGe hysterically like a mad woman.Meeting her hateful look, Jiang YaGe reflexively took a few steps backward toward the door. She couldn\u2019t handle the hatred coming from both Li WangJin and Wang SiXian. She felt only too ashamed to be standing in front of them. When she was just about to turn and leave, she bumped into a sturdy body. Just before she fell onto the ground, she was stopped by a pair of arms \u2013 it was Li ShiZe who had just arrived.Jiang YaGe had given Li ShiZe a call after she had arrived at the hospital. Li ShiZe was busy with work at the time and was finally able to get there. When he saw the bawling Jiang YaGe, a part of his heart ached with her.\u201cWhat happened, YaGe? Had someone mistreated you?\u201d Li ShiZe, who had just arrived, had no idea what was going on.Sniffling, Jiang YaGe summarized what had happened and told him. Li ShiZe frowned a little and looked at her pretty and perfect face and let out a sigh of relief \u2013 lucky it wasn\u2019t Jiang YaGe whose face was ruined.As Wang SiXian was the person who had brought about his parents\u2019 divorce, Li ShiZe was never that fond of her. Perhaps what happened to her was just her bad karma. He looked at Wang SiXian coldly and said, \u201cYaGe was already very upset, how could you keep jabbing at her? She has always thought of you as her most important family member. Can\u2019t you just be a little bit more considerate of her feelings? She had been so nice to you. She even stood up against my mother for her. Sure enough, an ungrateful white-eyed wolf like you is not worthy of being her family.\u201dWang SiXian was stunned. Wasn\u2019t she the biggest victim in this whole incident? How did she become the white-eyed wolf from Li ShiZe\u2019s perspective?\u201cBut I\u2019ve lost my looks because of her!\u201d She shrieked at the top of her lungs.Li ShiZe\u2019s look was very cold. \u201cYou\u2019ve only lost your face; she is hurting inside.\u201dIf Wang SiXian has a knife in her hand right now, she would not hesitate to stab Li ShiZe with it. She would never have guessed that Li ShiZe was capable of twisting the truth to this shameless extent. And yet, he was Li WangJin\u2019s only son and heir. She had already lost her looks. If she was to offend Li ShiZe right now, the remainder of her life would be very pathetic.The image of herself living in abject poverty in the future brought rationality into Wang SiXian\u2019s mind right away, and she recollected herself immediately.She went along with what he had said and cried. \u201cYou are right. I shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on YaGe. I was unlucky and it wasn\u2019t YaGe\u2019s fault. I shouldn\u2019t have done that to her.\u201dHer hand, hidden underneath her blanket, grabbed onto the bed sheet so tightly that there were marks on it. One of these days, she would get revenge for what happened to her today.Li WangJin was a little dazed by that. Compared to Wang SiXian, all of a sudden, everything that had happened to him in the past seemed to be so insignificant. If Wang SiXian could forgive YaGe and he was still dwelling on it, that would make him the bad person.If that was the case, why did he still feel so wronged?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She specifically hired someone to follow him around, and the entire scene that was unfolded in the hospital was recorded for her.Watching how Li ShiZe sided with Jiang YaGe bothered her. Her BBQ-Pork son had true love for Jiang YaGe, and she had no idea exactly what it was that he liked about her. That being said, she wasn\u2019t surprised by whatever that came out of him.If he could have said all the same thing to his own sister whom he had loved for many years in his previous life, nevermind Wang SiXian whom he never liked from the very beginning.After watching the recording, Li XinYun was dazed. \u201cWhatever happened to big brother? He wasn\u2019t like this before.\u201dAs much as she disliked Wang SiXian, should those words from him be coming from a human being?\u201cAfter all, Jiang YaGe is what\u2019s most important to him,\u201d said Fang JunRong nonchalantly.\u201cBut they have only known each other for a month. Where did this true love come from?\u201d XinYun pointed that out. She felt that her brother had become a completely different person.Jiang YaGe and Wang SiXian were obviously the ones who had hurt their mother. In fact, their mother was so angry that she had kicked her brother out of the house. Yet her brother would still side with Jiang YaGe with no hesitation. He had never even once apologized to their mother.Her brother now felt like a stranger to her.After her rebirth, Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t stand seeing any unhappiness from her daughter. She changed the subject right away. \u201cStop thinking about it. Let\u2019s go shopping.\u201dShopping was a very good way for women to release their stress.\u201cYeah! I want to buy purses! New ones! I want at least three purses!\u201dRecalling running into Jiang YaGe with this season\u2019s most recently released purse when she ran into her in the office, Li XinYun was furious.\u201cSure. I can even buy you 5 purses.\u201dThe bit of displeasure disappeared from Li XinYun immediately. Her happiness had always been very simple. Even though her father and brother liked Jiang YaGe better, that\u2019s alright; she still has her mother. If they didn\u2019t want her, then she didn\u2019t want them either.Fang JunRong drove with her daughter to a huge shopping mall and started buying away. She not only bought for her daughter, she bought for herself as well. She has lots of money now.Whatever her daughter liked, she would have the salesperson wrap them up. And she bought a couple for Zhong Yi as well.Halfway through their shopping spree, Fang JunRong heard someone call her name. She turned around and it was Sun Mei.Perhaps because she had used Sun Mei to achieve her own goals, now that she had run into her again, Fang JunRong felt that even her looks had become more pleasant.\u201cSun Mei.\u201d Fang JunRong nodded at her.Sun Mie looked at her with surprise. \u201cYou looked good spirited.\u201d She had expected Fang JunRong to look like a disheveled abandoned woman. Low and behind, Fang JunRong looked even happier than she was before and was carefree and cheerful. No, perhaps she was only pretending that everything was okay. After all, Fang JunRong always cared about how she appeared to others.Thinking about that, she couldn\u2019t help but lament. \u201cI know you are upset inside. Being a woman is so difficult.\u201d\u201cYes, it is quite difficult.\u201d Fang JunRong nodded in agreement.Sun Mei became excited all of a sudden, until her expression froze on her face after hearing what came out of Fang JunRong next.\u201c\u2026 I suddenly gained tens of billions of dollars under my name. It is difficult managing them. I can\u2019t even spend them all even if I spend a million dollars a day. Aye, spending money can be so tiring!\u201dSun Mei made her retreat regretfully. She had almost forgotten that Fang JunRong got at least half of the assets in the divorced. And, she heard that one piece of land shot up in prices right after her divorce.Dang! She wished she had problems like that too! If spending money was so tiring, she could always ask her for help!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Blinded by Fang JunRong\u2019s sparkling status as a wealthy person, she left dispirited.Fang JunRong didn\u2019t really get these people. Why did they all think she\u2019d be sad after her divorce with Li WangJin? She had so much money, and her precious daughter by her side. What was there to be sad about?Aye. She should buy herself another outfit. She should start getting involved in the corporate business after XinYun\u2019s birthday. She couldn\u2019t keep on slacking like she was. At the very minimum, she needed to do better than Ayron. All things aside, her BBQ-Pork son was still quite competent when it came to work. Jiang YaGe was only part of the reason he was able to increase their corporate assets several fold, a lot of it was his own ability.Both the mother and daughter felt pretty happy after their shopping spree.***Time flew by and then it was August 16, Li XinYun\u2019s birthday.Instead of their own place, Fang JunRong reserved a hotel in the downtown and even hired a few popular singers to perform for them. Surrounded by the music, Li XinYun wore the dress designed by Yang Xi, Fang JunRong\u2019s sister-in-law. The dress was pale yellow in color and had a round collared with no sleeves. The hem of the dress was adorned by many diamonds, making it look fluffy and full of life. Glowing with health and vigor, she looked like a real princess.Even though she didn\u2019t have on a tiara, the giant ruby around her neck attracted a lot of attention and also gave her an additional feel of sumptuousness. She had only invited her dad\u2019s business associates to her birthday banquets in the past. This was the first time she was able to invite her own schoolmates.Li XinYun\u2019s schoolmates had always known that she was from a wealthy family as she was usually surrounded by designer brand products. Today was the first time they truly had a glimpse of how wealthy her family really was. The cost for the hotel alone would be enough to cover several years of their families\u2019 expenditure. Not to mention, her party had singers that they had only seen on TV before. They were mesmerized by the scale of the event.Nevertheless, they were, after all, boys and girls who had just graduated high school and have yet to be affected by the real world. As surprised as they were, their mannerism did not change too drastically. Li XinYun spent most of her time greeting her schoolmates and would also occasionally greet the guests of the older generations as well.Fang JunRong brought Zhong Yi with her this time to have her appear in public. Zhong Yi had been having etiquette classes as of late and she was fairly presentable now, unlike how timid she was in the past. She was delicate looking. Now that she was more at ease, she looked like a blooming rose, vibrant and enthusiastic, making a very pleasant view.Everybody else had heard that Li WangJin had adopted a daughter, as did Fang JunRong. Were the two of them in some sort of a competition?What surprised them even more was that Fang JunRong was already in her forties, but her attractiveness rivaled Zhong Yi\u2019s in every way when the two of them stood side by side. Fang JunRong\u2019s look was flawless as though time had no effects on her. Many of the guests gathered around her and asked her for skincare secrets. After all, who didn\u2019t want to look pretty?\u201cI have been taking Beautifying Pills made by my own company. They will be available for purchase next month.\u201dMost of the ingredients for Beautify Pills could be found in the real world. The only must-have ingredient was the spring water from the jade dimension. Each pill required 10 mL of it. Without the spring water, the pills would lose its amazing effectiveness. So, it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to supply the spring water, gather all the other ingredients, and have them produced in a factory in the real world.Even though that spring looked pretty plentiful and limitless, Fang JunRong, leaning on the safe side, experimented with it. She diluted the spring water with 10 times the amount of water and used them to create the pills. Beautify Pills v2, as much as they weren\u2019t as effective as the non-diluted version, they were still more effective than any other products currently on the market in minimizing pores, lightening up spots, etc.She planned on putting the diluted version on the market.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fang JunRong, who had been prepared for this moment, immediately promised them that she would provide them with a round of treatment. That made the other madams very happy, and they had an added sincerity when they congratulated Li XinYun. Some of them even took off their bracelets and gifted them to Li XinYun right then and there.Once one of them had started, many others followed suit and gave her additional gifts. Anyone who wasn\u2019t blind could tell that Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t so close with her son as much anymore, but was definitely very doting to this daughter.Ergo, Li XinYun, on top of her birthday presents, received a lot of additional gifts. She was happy from her additional monetary gain. Even though most of the bracelets and jewelries weren\u2019t of the styles that she normally likes, they were valuable and nobody would turn that down.Even though most of those who were there have no reason to offend Li XinYun, the way she was the center of the attention still rubbed a few of the ones her age the wrong way. Deng Lan was one of them. Dang Lan\u2019s family wealth can rival that of Li XinYun\u2019s; her family was in the snack business.She also had an older brother at home, but unlike Li XinYun, her parents believed that boys were better than girls. Her older brother was treated like a king at home; whereas, she didn\u2019t get too much attention. She may not have to worry about money but her parents were also reluctant to spend too much time on her. Her purse was an outdated one from two years ago. She was different from Li XinYun, who had everything that she wanted handed to her.Deng Lan estimated that the birthday banquet itself cost over 5 million yuan. Meaning, Li XinYun\u2019s 17-year-old birthday banquet was on the same scale as Li ShiZe when he turned 18. She and Li XinYun were both the younger daughter in the family, but their statuses were two extremes. On top of that, Deng Lan was somewhat interested in Li ShiZe. In their circle, Li ShiZe was considered a good catch. He was incredibly good looking and also not promiscuous like many other Second Generation Rich.What was spent on Li XinYun was the equivalent of resources taken away from Li ShiZe. She had pleaded with her parents for a long time before they agreed to taking her to this banquet. She had wanted to have some facetime with Li ShiZe and leave a good impression with him, but he wasn\u2019t there at all. All of the reasons combined made her like Li XinYun even less.She walked over to Li XinYun with a wine glass in hand and asked casually, \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t see your brother and your dad today?\u201dLi XinYun gave her a look and didn\u2019t know who she was right away, but she replied politely, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t want to see them today.\u201d Even though her mother didn\u2019t want them to come, Li XinYun was still upset that they really didn\u2019t come. Plus, she didn\u2019t want others to gossip about her mother, so she thought she would take the blame herself. She was only 17 years old and the birthday girl today. She could afford to be a little bit capricious.Deng Lan paused for a little bit then. Putting on the look of a very understanding older sister, she said, \u201cOh. But you are already 17 years old, you shouldn\u2019t be so capricious anymore. You are a family after all and you will be able to resolve any misunderstandings you may have with them.\u201dThen she put on a sympathetic look and said, \u201cOh, I forgot. Your parents are divorced. No wonder.\u201dRemembering that made Deng Lan feel better. At least she has that over Li XinYun. Her parents didn\u2019t exactly get along well, but at least they did not have a divorce. Aunty Fang\u2019s temperament could be better.Li XinYun asked bluntly, \u201cNo wonder why?\u201dShe hated it when others were suggestive and intentionally vague.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My life is certainly different than it was before. In the past, I only had 100,000 yuan of pocket money a month. Now my mom gives me 500,000 yuan a month because she loves me so much.\u201dAs much as Li XinYun was not good at nonverbal communication, she could still tell that Deng Lan\u2019s intention was malicious. Seriously. What was wrong with this person, trying to pick on her at her birthday banquet?Deng Lan\u2019s look froze for a little \u2013 her pocket money was only 10,000 yuan a month. She even needed to save up if she wanted to buy any luxurious items. Compared to Li XinYun, her status was like that of a maid.Li XinYun said straight to her face, \u201cI don\u2019t like you much. Don\u2019t show up in front of me too often.\u201dShe was, after all, a spoiled child and would do or say whatever she wanted to.Li XinYun turned and walked away, leaving Deng Lan standing there with an angry and embarrassed look. She hadn\u2019t expected Li XinYun to have such a bad temperament and wasn\u2019t subtle at all. No wonder her own father and brother didn\u2019t like her and wouldn\u2019t even come to her birthday banquet. She felt bad for Li ShiZe for having such a rude sister.She took a deep breath and walked back to where she was as though nothing had happened, only to notice that the girls that she had been chatting with kept a distance from her when she walked toward them. Clearly, they didn\u2019t wish to talk to her again.That had embarrassed Deng Lan even more. Being ostracized by everyone made her feel that everybody was making fun of her.***Idiots like Deng Lan were in the minority. Li XinYun quickly forgot about the exchange and continued to enjoy her birthday banquet.After the end of the banquet and having seen all of the guests off with her mother, Li XinYun started going through all the gifts that she had received. The one that she liked the most among them was a set of topaz jewellery from her mother. Its craftsmanship was marvelous and the way they sparkled was dazzling.\u201cEh?\u201d She suddenly found a gift box with Li WangJin\u2019s name on the outside. Even though he didn\u2019t come in person, he had someone sent over a gift.Li XinYun felt a bit complicated. She thought that her father had already forgotten about her, but he still sent over a gift for her. As upset as she was with him, she still unwrapped the gift. It was a painting inside, and she could tell right away that it was the work of Xu FangWeng.As her father was a big fan of this artist, she, too, had learned quite a bit about the style of this artist.This was a painting of an orchid. She seemed to recall that her father had spent a million yuan on this. This was quite fancy of a birthday present. Perhaps, she wasn\u2019t entirely worthless in her father\u2019s mind.Feeling a little touched, she went to show her mother the gift.To her surprise, when Fang JunRong saw the painting, her smiling face dropped. \u201cThat good ol\u2019 Li WangJin!\u201dHow dare he give her daughter a useless piece of paper for her birthday!Li XinYun\u2019s mouth opened a little. She asked, perplexed, \u201cMom, do you not like this painting?\u201d She might not have much appreciation for it herself, but she at least knew that Xu FangWeng\u2019s paintings were very valuable.Fang JunRong snickered and said in a sarcastic way. \u201cThis painting is fake! He gave a fake to his own daughter. Not even I thought he\u2019d do that.\u201dShe had no intention to maintain his image in his child\u2019s mind after he had pulled such a stunt. Li XinYun was soft-hearted; she didn\u2019t want her falling for his tricks later on.\u201cHuh?\u201d Li XinYun thought she must have heard wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But she also didn\u2019t think her mother would badmouth her father intentionally, so she was dumbfounded\u2026Fang JunRong didn\u2019t want to say much. She simply picked up the phone and called up Li WangJin. Her voice was cold. \u201cYou gave a painting to XinYun?\u201dLi WangJin sounded a little tired from the other end. \u201cYeah, hadn\u2019t she wanted this one painting of mine? It\u2019s her birthday so I thought I\u2019ll just give it to her as a gift. She is my daughter after all, of course I care about her.\u201dHearing his words, Li XinYun\u2019s look relaxed some.Fang JunRong just wanted to snicker. How did he have the guts to still feign that he cared about his daughter after he had made such a disgusting move? Her voice became even colder. \u201cOh? I don\u2019t want to have anything that will remind me of you in my house, so I plan to auction the painting off.\u201dLi WangJin\u2019s voice went up a notch right away. \u201cWait, you can\u2019t do that! It\u2019s my gift to XinYun. It represents my love for her!\u201dFang JunRong looked over at Li XinYun and mouthed to her to play along with her.Li XinYun definitely trusted her mother more than her father. Taking the phone from her mother, she sounded very apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad, but I really don\u2019t want to upset Mom. If it will make her feel better auctioning the painting off, I\u2019d rather do that.\u201cBesides, you have already gifted it to me. I should be able to decide what to do with it.\u201dAs Li XinYun didn\u2019t have a speaker on, Fang JunRong couldn\u2019t hear what Li WangJin was saying from the other end, but she could see that Li XinYun\u2019s look grew darker and darker. Li XinYun finally just hung up the phone.She pouted and said, \u201cAs soon as I said I am going to auction the painting off, Dad went crazy. He said he regretted about giving it to me and wanted it back. He said he will send me a different gift.\u201dHad Fang JunRong not told her that there was something wrong with the painting in advance, Li XinYun might not have given it much thought. Li WangJin\u2019s reaction had confirmed everything. He was worried about the painting being appraised if it was to be auctioned off; meaning he knew all along that there was something wrong with it.Her own father. The gift from him was a counterfeit? How ironic and laughable!Li XinYun wanted to cry. She felt very wronged. She didn\u2019t understand what she had done that made her father dislike her and would do such a thing to her. He was generous with other women, except when it came to his own daughter. And he\u2019d insult her in such a way.She sniffled. Her voice with her tears choked back sounded very pitiful. \u201cWhy would Dad do such a thing?\u201dFang JunRong was calm. \u201cBecause Jiang YaGe is the daughter of his puppy love. Puppy love is always the best.\u201d To be precise, it was Li WangJin who had an one-sided crush on Jiang YaGe\u2019s mother, Wang SiEr.According to the book that she had read, Li WangJin tried his hand at business during his sophomore year in college and failed. He had lost all the funds given to him from his family as well as all the money in his own savings. Li WangJin was not the official heir of Li\u2019s. Not wanting to leave a bad impression with the elders in the family, he did not ask his family for help. If he did, that would be the equivalent of giving up his chance of being their heir.During the period when he was in abject poverty, Wang SiEr told him that she had tightened her own belt and saved up some money to help him out. She had since become his white moonlight. Except that Wang SiEr already had a boyfriend back then, so she turned him down. Li WangJin had buried this love affair deep inside his heart since.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She held her head up high to stop her tears from rolling down her cheeks. He was not worth her tears. But she was still angry and upset. Very angry!Then, she recalled her brother who had not once visited them ever since he had fallen in love with Jiang YaGe. He didn\u2019t even send her so much as a text on her birthday.The father and son were now dead to her.Fang JunRong comforted her for a little bit longer. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. We don\u2019t care about the painting. Let me use this to get more cash from your dad. The market price of that painting is at least 2 million yuan and up.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Fang JunRong needed the money, but that she knew that Li WangJin was short of cash lately \u2013 unless he sold more of his company shares. This month would doubtless be like cutting flesh off of him. Every time she saw him being unhappy made her happy.Alternatively, she could just let words out about this event, but she didn\u2019t want to do that. XinYun was, after all, his daughter. When others spoke of Li WangJin negatively, XinYun wouldn\u2019t be able to stay out of it altogether. She treasured her daughter and couldn\u2019t allow a piece of sh*t to be stuck onto her.She squinted a little. She could, however, encourage others to appreciate Li WangJin\u2019s collections and preferably have a few experts of antiques in there to help along in exposing him.***Li WangJin talked and talked. He spent a lot of time getting the painting back from Li XinYun. Then, he had to give her 2 million yuan shopping money for her birthday. He felt extremely mistreated when he handed the money over.He started to realize that Fang JunRong had changed a lot from how he remembered her since the divorce. She was even more aggressive than before, as though she truly didn\u2019t love him anymore.He never should have sent over that painting for the purpose of saving some money. Now he was out of pocket even more. What made him worry even more was whether XinYun noticed that something was wrong with the painting.No, probably not. With XinYun\u2019s bad temperament, had she found out about it, she would have unleashed on him already.He wiped away the sweat on his forehead. Divorcing from Fang JunRong hurt him a lot. Even when he took out a loan, he didn\u2019t have a lot of cash that he could work with. XinYun, being with JunRong, had also gotten worse. All she saw now was money and didn\u2019t care about her father at all.Another call came in. Looking at the name flashing on the screen, Li WangJin picked up the phone quickly. He hung up after five minutes. Even though he was still somewhat depressed, he felt a sense of satisfaction.The call was from a private investigator that he has hired. After a lot of time and effort, he was finally able to collect evidence that Wang Xiao tried to set him up. Once these evidences were sent in, even if Wang Xiao could weasel out of it, he for sure wouldn\u2019t be able to get off scotch free.Ah, he was finally able to take revenge on Wang Xiao and let him know that he wasn\u2019t someone that could be offended with no consequences.The private investigator was good, but also cost a lot. He cost him another 2 million yuan. And Li WangJin still needed to save up some money to network with others and also to cover his daily expenses.He thought about it for a little and decided to temporarily halt Jiang YaGe\u2019s pocket money. After all, the reason that Wang Xiao has been targeting him is because of her actions. Once he has some money free up in the company, he\u2019d make it up to her. YaGe was kind and tender; he was sure she wouldn\u2019t mind.His brows unfurrowed \u2013 he just needed to make it through this period of time. He even started thinking that perhaps this was just a bad year for him. Maybe he should make a trip to a temple or have some feng shui master come and check his place out for the sake of improving his luck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang SiXian had already undergone her first surgery and needed to stay in the hospital for a few days.Jiang YaGe was not happy after her adopted father told her the news. He had expressed that all of his capital would be tied up in his company recently. He was a bit tight in cash and had to temporarily halt her pocket money. She had just experienced what it was like to spend money madly like a wealthy girl and now her privilege was robbed from her right away.She recalled what she had heard when she visited her adopted father\u2019s company that afternoon.\u201cChairman said to send Master Xu\u2019s masterpiece to Miss.\u201d\u201cWhich Miss?\u201d\u201cLi XinYun, the Li\u2019s real Miss, of course. I heard that the painting is worth over 1 million yuan. It goes to show that Chairman\u2019s favorite is still his real daughter, Li XinYun. I had mistakenly thought that he prefers Jiang YaGe over her before.\u201d\u201cYou are overthinking this. Jiang YaGe is something fun and a flavor of the day thing. Of course she won\u2019t measure up to the real daughter. Just because a sparrow can land on a tree branch doesn\u2019t make it a phoenix,\u201d said the female voice sarcastically.\u201cBoy, you are a mean one. Didn\u2019t you have her milk tea? She had been bringing us milk tea every afternoon in the last few days.\u201d\u201cWho cares about a cup of 5 \u2013 6 yuan milk tea? I don\u2019t even drink it normally. When Miss came to visit last time, she brought everyone Essence Coffee. Now that\u2019s how a real Miss should be like, not frugal like Jiang YaGe.\u201d\u201cHehe. Are you still going to drink the milk tea that she brings tomorrow then?\u201d\u201cI am not going to drink it, but I can still take it and give it to a beggar on my way home. That will be my good deed of the day.\u201dJiang YaGe tried very hard to squeeze the words out of her head, but she only ended up with an even more lasting impression of them. No, they were just instigating. She can\u2019t trust them! They were envious of her and couldn\u2019t bear to see her happy.She had felt so much appreciation for how her adopted father had doted on her. Yet that feeling of appreciation had changed since she found out that her adopted father had given such an expensive painting to Li XinYun. Her adoptive father had always treasured his collection and would not give them away usually. She had never received any herself.Now that her adopted father had run out of money, he would rather stop her pocket money than giving her one of his collection. He probably didn\u2019t care for her as much as he said he did.As the saying goes, going from a wealthy lifestyle to a frugal one is always difficult. Jiang YaGe had been going out with her friends a lot lately and bought many luxurious clothing and shoes to emphasize her status as the Li\u2019s Miss. That had led to her not having a lot of money remaining at her disposal.She had planned to take her roommate to a 5-star restaurant in a couple of days. She thought her adopted father would have given her more pocket money so she wouldn\u2019t embarrass herself in front of others.As though her hands have minds of their own, she typed in Li XinYun in the search box of the browser.Immediately an article showed up about her \u2013 Li XinYun standing at her birthday banquet in a dress adorned with a myriad of diamonds, looking proud like a princess. She quickly skimmed over the article. It talked a lot about the birthday banquet; they even hired a few popular singers to perform there. She could only imagine how much the banquet had cost; and she, on the other hand, had her pocket money taken away from her.All of the discussions were about how envious others were of Li XinYun. She had become everyone\u2019s ideal.Jiang YaGe took a deep breath and closed up the webpage. The more she read, the more unhappy she became. And it wasn\u2019t just because of Li XinYun. Even Zhong Yi looked poised and elegant in the picture.First thing first, she needed to figure out how to get herself some cash. Everybody knew that she had become Li WangJin\u2019s adopted daughter. She needed to play the part when school started again. If she didn\u2019t, many would gossip about her behind her back. More importantly, she couldn\u2019t let Zhong Yi outshine her.She couldn\u2019t possibly sell her clothing or shoes; she would need those to put up the front.Then something popped into her mind, and her eyes lit up all of a sudden.That\u2019s right. Fang JunRong had gifted her a painting from Xu FangWeng at their first meeting. If she was to sell the painting, the money she got from it could tie her over for a few months at least. By then, her adopted father\u2019s money would be freed up and she would receive her pocket money again.The thought put a smile back on her worried face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The original one was picked by Li WangJin and looking at it would irritate her. Their best product in the past was a set of astringent, firming toner, and a smoother toner.Fang JunRong was already at the human trial phase to see whether the result of the makeup product would increase if they used the spring water from her dimension, but it would still take a while before they would receive the results.She looked over them one by one and finally the second to last one caught her attention. It was the drawing of a mountain surrounded by a ring of water, representing nature. It reminded her instantly of her bracelet, so pointing at that one, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s use this one.\u201dXu WeiWei looked at it and smiled. \u201cYeah, I quite like this one as well.\u201d Then, stroking her own cheek and looking very high-spirited, she said, \u201cBoy, oh, boy. Your beautifying pills are no joke. I took a round of them and now my skin is much firmer than before! And a lot of my friends asked me about it as well.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s lips curved upward a little. \u201cThe ones that I gave you are better than the ones that we will be selling.\u201dXu WeiWei asked, \u201cHow much do you think we should price them at?\u201d A box was one round of treatment containing seven pills inside, one a day. They had already manufactured 10,000 boxes and would be released onto the market in September.\u201cLet\u2019s just make it 888, it\u2019s lucky.\u201d Fang JunRong didn\u2019t feel that it was overly expensive. After all, the effectiveness of her product was much better than others on the market. It was definitely a steal at that price.Plus, the result was obvious after just one round of treatment.Had Xu WeiWei never used it before, she would probably feel that it was on the expensive side. But now that she had used them herself, 888 yuan each was dirt cheap.\u201cOkay, I will start on the marketing then.\u201d Xu WeiWei had taken on the position as Vice President since she had come over. The VP before her was Li WangJin\u2019s man. Fang JunRong had a deal with Li WangJin. She pulled back her people from Ayron, and he pulled back those who were loyal to him from Meifang.She couldn\u2019t be certain that she hadn\u2019t missed any, but at the very minimum, she could be sure that all the ones that held the critical positions were loyal to her. These employees had stayed with her and never strayed in her previous life. They have undergone a lot of hardships. Even just for them alone, she would want to make sure her company only gets better and better.\u201cOh right, who do you want to be our spokesperson?\u201d\u201cYou can make that decision. I am not familiar in this area,\u201d said Fang JunRong. Then, a name popped into her mind and her face turned cold. \u201cExcept for Fang JueMing. I do not want to work with him.\u201dIn her previous life, Jiang YaGe had helped him out with her White Jade Cream. Ever since then, Fang JueMing had become one of her loyalists. On many occasions, he used his own status and popularity to help her out. Of course, he only said she was like a sister to him to the general public. His fans had accepted this so-called sister of his and did a lot for her. In her previous life, Li XinYun had experienced a lot of internet violence and all sorts of verbal abuse because of this and was even depressed for a while.Even though Jiang YaGe might not have anything to do with Fang JueMing in this lifetime, Fang JunRong hated this man and wanted nothing to do with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had no rush to pick a spokesperson. Truth be told, as much as Meifang\u2019s brand had been around for a bit, it\u2019s market share was just alright. After all, both Fang JunRong and Li WangJin had placed their focus on their other company. The most valuable thing about this company was its location. Even if they wanted to hire a first-tier actor, they might not be able to. They might as well wait until they have made a name for themselves, then others would fight over the opportunity.\u201cLet\u2019s release our product on September 8. That is the day that XinYun starts school. Yup, and we will have a 10% off discount for the day. No need for other promotional activities.\u201dFang JunRong had already decided that from now on, this product would only have promotional activities on XinYun\u2019s birthday. Not even on 11/11 or 12/12.*(T/N: 11/11 or 12/12 are dates that Chinese retailers traditionally offer steep discounts. Think Black Fridays in the US.)Xu WeiWei busted out laughing. \u201cYou do love XinYun a lot.\u201d But she likes that girl a lot too.The two of them discussed some other related issues before Xu WeiWei left valiantly and gallantly with two boxes of Beautifying Pills. Right now, she felt very confident in the future of the company, or better yet, very confident in Beautifying Pills.***Fang JunRong had been passing her days happily ever since the divorce. With the money that she had received, she bought the stocks of a few companies that she remembered had done well in her memories from her previous life. But she also saved some fluid capital just in case.Her daughter XinYun would be starting school in September and Zhong Yi even earlier. Fang JunRong had taken some time to go with them to purchase supplies for school. They could, of course, buy those by themselves, but as their mother, she didn\u2019t want to miss any stages of their lives.Even though XinYun put up a \u201cMom\u2019s too clingy and I am troubled\u201d look, Fang JunRong could tell that she was actually very happy and starting to forget about the pain brought to her by Li WangJin.Both XinYun and Zhong Yi\u2019s colleges were local, and both were within the top 50 in the country. XinYun\u2019s college was in City S and a little bit further from home. Fang JunRong happened to have two houses near the university, so she tidied up one of the places and put her daughter\u2019s stuff over there. That way XinYun would have the option to stay there if she didn\u2019t like staying in the dormitory.After she had bought XinYun and Zhong Yi each a computer, Fang JunRong waved at them and said, \u201cYou two have fun shopping. I am going to go meet up with your Aunty He.\u201dEver since the birthday banquet, Fang JunRong had been going out to dine with her friends from time to time. Today, she would be meeting up with He JianBing. She had learned a few days earlier that the He\u2019s was finally able to claim the property in question. This differed from what happened in her previous life; that Wang Xiao wasn\u2019t able to take it from them.The club that she was heading to was owned by the He\u2019s and located next to the ocean. The few best private rooms even have private beach access. She pushed open the door and found He JianBing in her swimsuit, relaxingly on a beach lounger.Hearing noises behind her, she sat up and smiled at Fang JunRong. \u201cYou are here, JunRong.\u201dIt is now early evening and the sun was setting over the blue ocean. It looked like there were broken gold pieces floating on the water and the scene was dazzling. The sea breeze mixed in with moisture and the smell of the ocean make the air feel less stuffy.Fang JunRong laid down on the lounger next to her and said, \u201cYou sure know how to enjoy yourself.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t have to worry about anyone eavesdropping in an open area like this,\u201d said He JianBingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had bugged their study, and her father and brother had the habit of having their discussions there. Some of the family\u2019s confidential information was almost leaked to Wang Xiao by her niece. She had no idea what Wang Xiao had given her niece to make her willing to betray her family.But once they had figured that out, they used the same method to trick Wang Xiao instead. The marriage alliance between the He\u2019s and the Wang\u2019s existed because they had high hopes in Wang Xiao. But, even with high hopes, no family would want to keep a white-eyed wolf around.The He\u2019s wanted to call off the alliance, but He ShuHua absolutely refused. Her father, fed up with how spoiled the girl was, finally lost all his patience with her and kicked her out.He JianBing did not elaborate too much on He ShuHua as that was considered a private family matter. She did, however, tell Fang JunRong that they had already started plotting against Wang Xiao.\u201cThat ex-husband of yours was so useless ever since he has left you. He hired someone to look into Wang Xiao and was almost fooled by him instead. Finally, we couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and lent him a hand. Granted, we\u2019ve decided to make some money off of him along the way.\u201d The private eye hired by Li WangJin were sent by the He\u2019s as no regular private eye would be able to find dirt on Wang Xiao.Fang JunRong paused for a little and busted out laughing. \u201cAnd here I thought he was lucky to have found someone competent.\u201dShe figured that the He\u2019s would like to see Li WangJin and Wang Xiao get at each other and was excited to see how this all had turned out.He JianBing was much more in the knows than Fang JunRong when it came to stuff like this, so she shared with Fang JunRong that Li WangJin had already submitted the evidence that he had collected. The evidence was so solid that Wang Xiao had been pretty frantic as of late. He wanted to push someone below him out to take all the blame and clear himself, but with the He\u2019s operating behind the scene, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to get away scot-free.\u201cMany of his other crimes had come into the light as well. He\u2019d at least be put away for some ten years.\u201dWhen Fang JunRong heard that, she vaguely remembered what happened to her daughter in her previous life and finally felt a little bit better. Knowing that he would pay for his crimes, she was much happier now.In addition to talking about Wang Xiao, the other subject that He JianBing wanted to talk to her about was the Beautify Pills.\u201cYour Beautify Pills worked so well. My mom was like a bandit and took whatever that I had left. When are you going to start selling them?\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s smile deepened. Countless friends had asked her about Beautify Pills recently. \u201cThey will be on the market next month. I will have someone send you a few more boxes tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. Don\u2019t worry. I will make sure to have stars from my company advertise for you then. He JianBing owned a studio under her name and has a few stars on contract. Two of them were quite popular.Naturally, Fang JunRong would not turn that down. The two of them went to the hot spring for a little bit, had a massage, had dinner, and finally parted ways, completely pleased. The food at the club was surprisingly good, especially the cabbage in broth. It was Fang JunRong\u2019s favorite.As Fang JunRong had eaten a bit much over dinner, she was a little bit stuffed, so she decided to go for a walk before heading home to help with digestion after she took off from the club. Her two bodyguards followed from a distance behind her.\u201cHey! Don\u2019t sleep here! This is my turf!\u201d Noises of people fighting came from below a bridge not too far from them; most likely beggars fighting over their turfs. As much as City S was a bustling city, it couldn\u2019t all be rainbow and sunshine. Naturally, it has dark corners where the sun wouldn\u2019t shine.One of the men whose territory was taken over shoved the man sitting on the ground angrily. The person leaned and felt directly on the ground.\u201cHey! Hey! Are you alright?! Don\u2019t try to scam me!\u201d\u201cPsst! So unlucky. Guess I will go somewhere else.\u201dThe man, obviously not wanting to get involved, left angrily.Fang JunRong, too, had assumed that the person on the ground was scamming the one who left. But, she watched for a little while, and the man on the ground still didn\u2019t stir.It would have been and had she not seen it at all, but now that she had witnessed it, she couldn\u2019t pretend that she didn\u2019t.Fang JunRong turned to her bodyguards and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201dShe walked over and could tell from the body shape that it was a man, a skinny one at that. His skin was an abnormal green color with a hint of purple. Under the moonlight, half of his face was rotten and he looked vicious. He had a yellow buddha necklace around his neck. The buddha\u2019s smile was somewhat crooked, it looked both casual and also somewhat odd.Through that buddha, however, Fang JunRong was able to figure out who he was \u2013 Jiang WenYu. In the novel that she had read, he had caused Jiang YaGe somewhat of a headache. He could be considered a boss villain of sorts.Just for the fact that he had been Jiang YaGe\u2019s enemy, she must save him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To be precise, she and her daughter were mostly in the first half of the book and Jiang WenYu was in the second half.It was only mentioned in the book that Jiang WenYu and Zhang Bi, a suitor of Jiang YaGe\u2019s, were twins. Jiang WenYu got separated from his parents when he was a child and was kidnapped. The Zhang\u2019s were able to reunite with him again after he had grown up and brought him back. Jiang WenYu had a lot of hatred for the Zhang\u2019s and that hatred also extended onto Jiang YaGe.Jiang WenYu was very talented in the medical field and every bit as good as the miracle doctor Zhang Bi. After rejoining the Zhang\u2019s, his knowledge increased like a sponge soaking up water. In particular, he was arguably a genius when it came to pharmaceuticals. He was extremely sensitive in the area of taste and olfactory and could figure out ingredients from medicines.He had caused trouble for Jiang YaGe over and over again. If it wasn\u2019t for Jiang YaGe\u2019s Detoxification Pills, he probably would have wiped out the entire Zhang\u2019s. In the end, Jiang WenYu was no match for Zhang\u2019s and Jiang YaGe\u2019s cheat and died from being poisoned. Zhang Bi, who \u201ccouldn\u2019t take it anymore\u201d was the one who did it.From the perspective of Jiang YaGe and the Zhang\u2019s, Jiang WenYu had it coming and only got what he deserved.He was exhibiting all the symptoms described in the book after he was poisoned. Meaning, even if Jiang WenYu wasn\u2019t poisoned by Zhang Bi, it would have been someone from the Zhang\u2019s. However, according to the book, Jiang WenYu was only discovered by the Zhang\u2019s and rejoined them after he received a medical award overseas a year from now. Right now, he should just be a professor in a university.Fang JunRong turned her attention back onto the buddha that was around Jiang WenYu\u2019s neck. It gave her a familiar feeling, somewhat similar to what she felt from her jade.Jiang WenYu was collapsed on the ground, his blood, black, came out of him and dripped onto the buddha.Nothing happened.Fang JunRong turned to her body guards and said, \u201cTake him with us. We should at least try to save him.\u201dThe bodyguards came up, picked him up, and shoved him into the backseat of the car.Fang JunRong did not bring him back to her place but to another residence under her name that was close by. Jiang WenYu was unconscious the entire time, his brows furrowed deeply.Once they had arrived, Fang JunRong gave him a Detoxification Pill, had the bodyguards watched over him, and turned in.***When Jiang WenYu opened up his eyes, the very first thing he did was to reach for the buddha around his neck. He was glad that it was still there. He had been wearing this buddha around his neck since he was a child. It was gold colored initially. Over time, Jiang WenYu noticed that the statue would heal him every time he was injured. Each time he was healed, its color would fade a little more. It had turned almost all white now.He looked around the room. As much as there weren\u2019t a lot of furniture in the room \u2013 just a bed and a desk, it was obvious that they were very pricey from the way they looked.He had walked outside the campus to mail something to his mother when he was attacked and forced to swallow a pill before being tossed under the bridge. Since then, he had experienced the pain of his life leaving his body bit by bit.His face felt as if it was rotting, and his limbs felt weak. He didn\u2019t even know who he had offended that would want him dead. He struggled to remember the ingredients that were inside the pill that he was forced to swallow.When he was fading in and out of consciousness, he heard a pleasant and majestic voice, \u201cTake him with us. We should at least try to save him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wasn\u2019t feeling as awful as he did before he lost consciousness and had regained a little bit of strength. One of the bodyguards not too far away noticed that his eyes were opened, nodded at him, and left.After a little while, Jiang WenYu saw a woman in a black dress walking over to him. The black dress contrasted greatly with her pale skin and made her look surreal. The woman was beautiful and graceful, her temperament was elegant, and the way she looked at him nonchalantly seemed to have a hint of a smile in it.\u201cThank you,\u201d said Jiang WenYu with his hoarse voice. He was gone so far this time that he wasn\u2019t even sure if his buddha statue would have been able to save him. He very likely would have just died in that filthy corner without anyone even knowing about it.\u201cI just happened to be there at the right time,\u201d said Fang JunRong. She asked about his identity as there shouldn\u2019t be any reasons why she\u2019d know who he was.Out of his appreciation for her, Jiang WenYu did not hide anything from her. Fang JunRong had therefore learned that he was 29 years old and was a professor at a college.\u201cDo you need me to take you back to your place?\u201d asked Fang JunRong.Jiang WenYu paused for a bit and shook his head. \u201cNo, not yet.\u201d He didn\u2019t know who it was, but they obviously wanted him dead. Returning to his place before he found out what was going on would be a very bad idea.Fang JunRong thought about it for a bit. As much as Jiang WenYu was portrayed as the villain in the book, looking back at everything that he had done, he had never hurt any innocent people. He had always aimed his ammunition at the Zhang\u2019s. Plus, he was very loyal to those who had helped him in the past.She produced an azure porcelain bottle, put it on the nightstand next to his bed, and said, \u201cThis is the medicine that you\u2019ve had last night. It works for the poison that\u2019s in your body. You can give it a try. If you are able to make this from scratch, you would be doing me a huge favor.\u201dTwo of the ingredients used to make the detoxification pills \u2013 phymatopsis trisecta and qingxia \u2013 could not be found in this world. She had tried to plant them in the real world, but they both died within a couple of days. If Jiang WenYu could figure out what ingredients could be used to replace those two, even if the effect wasn\u2019t as good as the original, it could still be used by others and would be a contribution to the world.She picked up a notebook nearby and scribbled the formula on there. Granted, she left out phymatopsis trisecta and qingxia, as they did not exist in this world.Jiang WenYu cleared his throat and there seemed to be sparks in his eyes. In a very definitive tone, he said, \u201cI will be able to create them.\u201d He had no idea why she had such faith in his ability, but he was willing to give it a try.Fang JunRong nodded satisfactorily and added. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will compensate you fairly for your work.\u201dShe contacted her lawyer and had him come over to draft a contract. His base pay would start at 50,000 yuan. For every world-wide publication that he has published, he\u2019d receive a 10% raise. Jiang WenYu would need to quit his current job before he could sign the contract.Fang JunRong wasn\u2019t in any hurry. She has time. She could wait.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This painting was given to her by Fang JunRong when she first came to the Li\u2019s. Jiang YaGe was very appreciative of it at the time and felt that her adopted mother was truly nice to her. No, she couldn\u2019t call her her adoptive mother anymore.She never would have thought that it was a counterfeit!Fang JunRong used a counterfeit painting to trick her for her affection? Or that, she herself was a counterfeit as far as Fang JunRong was concerned? What she gave Zhong Yi was expensive jewelry!Her eyes reddened. She had already spent the remainder of her money hiring appraisers to appraise the painting. She refused to believe it when the first appraisal result came. She had subsequently hired a few other appraisers and each and every single one of them told her definitely that it was a counterfeit and that it was done within the last five years.Thinking about the look of disgust that she had received from all the others, her hatred from Fang JunRong started to rise. Why did Fang JunRong have to insult her so?She wanted to tear the painting that had caused her such pain into pieces, but she also didn\u2019t want to let Fang JunRong get away with it just like that. But the gap between herself and Fang JunRong was too big, plus Fang JunRong was ShiZe\u2019s mother. If she didn\u2019t handle it delicately, it might negatively affect her relationship with ShiZe.Li ShiZe was the most elite person that Jiang YaGe has ever met in her life, and he happened to be fond of her. Especially after they had inadvertently become a couple, the two of them had been very closed with each other. She already saw Li ShiZe as her husband in her mind, which means Fang JunRong would be her future mother-in-law.All of a sudden, Jiang YaGe became very torn.That turned into self-pity shortly. Why did she have to run into such an evil mother-in-law?\u201cYaGe, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dJiang YaGe saw Li WangJin standing in front of her with a look of concern after she had recollected herself. She wiped away her tears and held herself back. \u201cNothing. Nobody has mistreated me.\u201dLi WangJin had been having a series of bad luck lately and his company has lost a few big orders. He had swarmed himself and didn\u2019t really have that much time to comfort Jiang YaGe. He loosened his tie and said, \u201cGood. We wouldn\u2019t want anyone to mistreat you.\u201dJiang YaGe tried and tried, but she finally couldn\u2019t help herself. Feeling unjust, she said, \u201cDad, this painting that Mom gave me seems to be a counterfeit.\u201cWhy would she do that to me? Did she hate me from the very beginning?\u201d The more she thought about it, the more unjust she felt and she started crying all over again.Li WangJin froze and looked over at the painting in question. His voice became louder. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible! JunRong isn\u2019t that kind of a person. Must be the appraisers that you have hired. All they want is to trick you for money. You shouldn\u2019t fall for them!\u201cAnd why did you have the painting appraised for no reasons? Do you not trust us?\u201d Thinking that his reputation would be ruined should it ever come to light, Li WangJin couldn\u2019t think about anything else and his voice became very severe.Jiang YaGe was startled by him and was dumbfounded. After she had recollected herself, she felt even more unjust. Why did her adopted father get angry at her? She was the victim here!But she knew very well that she was only able to be a wealthy girl because of her adopted father. She sniffled and gave him her usual delicate smile. \u201cYes, I understand. It\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have misunderstood Mom.\u201dEven though she had said that, Li WangJin was still worried. With a solemn look, he said, \u201cSchool is about to start soon. If you have time to goof around, you might as well do some studying at home. Did you say you wanted to pick up piano before? How\u2019s that coming along?\u201cWhat about your calligraphy and painting? Maybe I can sign you up to a few classes.\u201dPerhaps it was precisely because Jiang YaGe has too much free time that she\u2019d be messing around with this. He needed to fill up her schedule so she would stop thinking about all kinds of things. His heart almost popped out of his chest earlier.Jiang YaGe reacted like she was stuck by lightning. Stuttering, she said, \u201cNo, no. That would not be necessary. I need to help ShiZe. I am now his assistant.\u201d She quickly threw out Li ShiZe as her excuse.Li WangJin was no fool. \u201cYeah right. You are not a professional. What could you do around him? Make him tea? You\u2019d just distract him! I will hire a few tutors for you tomorrow.\u201dHe was the one who suggested for Jiang YaGe to become Li ShiZe\u2019s assistant and now he was the one who said it was a bad idea.In the half an hour that followed, Jiang YaGe was bombarded with all sorts of classes. She was very unhappy. Finally, she walked back to her room, dazed. What had just happened? This was all Fang JunRong\u2019s fault!She happened to see the painting that she had brought back with her and got an idea. There was a very hot show lately that would appraise antiques live on the show. She could go on the show.When the expert announced that this was a counterfeit, then it would have nothing to do with her. She wasn\u2019t the one who gave it away as a gift; it was Fang JunRong who did that!She might be a mild-tempered person normally, but she couldn\u2019t just let this go. It\u2019s now time to find justice for herself! Her aunty was right, she shouldn\u2019t be a pushover. She needed to change.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had been busy with work lately and also checking on Jiang WenYu when she has free time in between.After having the detoxification pills from Fang JunRong, the poison was cleared from Jiang WenYu\u2019s body quickly and his pretty face has returned. His look leaned more toward those from the old days, elegant with a hint of softness. If he\u2019d picked up a folding fan, he\u2019d look like a scholar that just walked straight out of a book. Look wise, he resembled Zhang Bi, his twin brother. Except that Zhang Bi has more of a masculine look to him. Fang JunRong speculated that they were fraternal twins.His eyes were very bright. As her daughter would put it, there\u2019s a galaxy in his eyes.He had planned to return to the campus to resign, but he had since found out that someone had already put in the resignation for him. A process that should be done by him in person had, somehow, been taken care of.Naturally, Jiang WenYu could smell that something wasn\u2019t right at all. More likely than not, it has to do with whoever tried to kill him. He had always thought of himself as an everyday Joe and had no idea who he had offended to a point that they wanted him dead.Without status or power, he had no choice but to rely on Fang JunRong for help.Original translation is from fuyuneko dot org. If you\u2019re reading this elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.Fang JunRong, on the other hand, had a pretty good idea that it was the handy work of the Zhang\u2019s. After all, when she saw Jiang WenYu, the effects of the poison that he was exhibited matching that of the kind that belong uniquely to the Zhang\u2019s according to the book. The process of making it was quite complicated. What she couldn\u2019t figure out was since his existence had already been brought to the Zhang\u2019s attention, shouldn\u2019t they have already welcomed him home? After all, Jiang WenYu and Zhang Bi were twins and Zhang Bi grew up at the Zhang\u2019s. There was no reason why the existence of Jiang WenYu would threaten Zhang Bi\u2019s status within the Zhang\u2019s.There was something hazy about the Zhang\u2019s that she couldn\u2019t quite figure out. Perhaps Jiang WenYu had found out something about the Zhang\u2019s in her previous life, which was why he targeted them before.She agreed to help him out and also spent a large amount of money on building a laboratory for him, dropping tens of millions just like that. She did that because she had faith in Jiang WenYu\u2019s ability and wanted to provide the opportunity for him to shine. Nevertheless, from an outsider\u2019s perspective, Jiang WenYu was only a regular college professor. He had no outstanding achievements besides his good looks.Therefore, Fang JunRong\u2019s behavior could only be explained as her being dazzled by his good looks. That was the only reasonable explanation for her behavior.Even Xu WeiWei made a special trip to go and check out Jiang WenYu. She seemed to have let out a sigh of relief after she had checked him out.Baffled, Fang JunRong asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dXu WeiWei hesitated for a little and said, \u201cI thought you had a change of heart and decided to keep a little fresh meat but realized that I was wrong after meeting Jiang WenYu. He didn\u2019t look like that kind of a person.\u201dThere was definitely more passion in his eyes when he was looking at the cans and bottles in his laboratory than when he was looking at women.Hearing that, Fang JunRong busted out laughing. What the heck\u2026\u201cOur Beautify Pills are more or less complete. We can begin pre-sale in a few days and launch it officially on 9/8,\u201d said Xu WeiWei.\u201cAwesome. Let\u2019s push out 50,000 for our first batch.\u201dXu WeiWei brought up another incident. \u201cBy the way, Jiang YaGe is really a character.\u201dFang JunRong\u2019s face dropped when she heard the name. \u201cWhat did she do now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That being said, everything was all relative. Her quality of life wasn\u2019t as good as the period immediately preceding it, but still much better than what her life was like before that. As much as Li WangJin didn\u2019t have a lot of money, he\u2019d still give her some money. And that BBQ pork son of hers started calling her more frequently a few days ago. After picking it up the first time, she had blocked his number.She wasn\u2019t dumb enough to be Li ShiZe\u2019s ATM machine.As she had divorced Li WangJin, many of Fang JunRong\u2019s acquaintances informed her that Li WangJin was very determined to keep Wang Xiao in jail and had been pulling all sorts of strings and spending loads and loads of money over this.Xu WeiWei said, \u201cDo you remember Zhou Yang? She has been hosting an antique appraisal show lately, I think it\u2019s called \u201cThe Fate of Antiques\u201d. It\u2019s quite popular for a show. She said to me that Jiang YaGe had applied to go on the show and wanted to have a piece of Xu FengWeng\u2019s work appraised. I seem to recall that you have given her a piece of Xu FengWeng\u2019s work as a gift when you first met her?\u201d\u201cZhou Yang asked if they should stop her from getting onto the show?\u201d As the host of the show and that Jiang YaGe didn\u2019t have many who backed her, all Zhou Yang needed to do was to say a word to stop her from getting onto the show.Fang JunRong, on the other hand, was very happy when she heard the news. Her lips curved a happy arc. \u201cWhy would we want to stop her? Let her onto the show!\u201dThen she asked casually, \u201cIf she is going onto the show. Approximately when will it be aired?\u201d\u201cIn a week, probably around the 6th?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s free advertising for me. We will be able to save so much. I am sure she is doing this behind Li WangJin\u2019s back. If he knows about it, he\u2019d for sure do everything within his power to try and stop her.\u201dWhen this blows up, it\u2019d do wonders to Li WangJin\u2019s reputation. Thinking about that day, Fang JunRong eagerly looked forward to the date that the show would be aired.Xu WeiWei, after figuring out the intricacies behind it all, nodded and said, \u201cThat works. I\u2019ll let Zhou Yang know to make sure Jiang YaGe receives the best spotlight.\u201dXu WeiWei was the vice president now. With Fang JunRong delegating most of the work to her, she was usually very busy. She needed to hurry back to the office after finishing her conversation with Fang JunRong. She did, however, enjoy her current lifestyle a lot.***Li XinYun, Fang JunRong\u2019s daughter, came home not long after Xu WeiWei had taken off. She was frowning and looking very unhappy.\u201cWho upset you?\u201d asked Fang JunRong.She remembered that her daughter had picked up ice-skating recently and had been leaving the house early every day.Li XinYun sat down next to Fang JunRong and leaned on her much like she used to when she was still a child. \u201cBig brother called me today.\u201d\u201cHe asked you to lend him money?\u201d Fang JunRong asked right away.Li XinYun sat up straight. Her eyes widened and looked even more round than usual. \u201cHow did you guess, Mom?\u201dIn a nonchalant way and without showing her emotions, Fang JunRong said, \u201cHe never called me after the divorce to ask about my well-being but had been calling me frequently the last few days and wouldn\u2019t stop talking about wanting to start his own business and needing start-up capital. I had stopped answering his calls.\u201dWhat she hadn\u2019t expected was that her BBQ-pork son would turn to her daughter instead. That being said, XinYun has no shortage of money. She got pocket money from Fang JunRong every month and all the other red packets that she received were put away for her by Fang JunRong. Fang JunRong had also shown her some ropes on investments. Over the years, she should at least have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said his team had developed a new software but needs the capital to push it to the market. He said he is asking me to invest in it and will profit-share with me. He also said that he would do right by me.\u201dTalking about this made Li XinYun angry. Her brother didn\u2019t even get her a birthday present on her birthday and the one time that he called her was to ask her for money? And that high and mighty tone of his. He made it sound like it would be her loss if she didn\u2019t invest in him. Was she stupid? She yelled at him over the phone and hung up on him.\u201cYou are better off buying stocks of my company,\u201d said Fang JunRong. For sure the stock price of her company would go up by a lot.Li XinYun cocked her head a little and asked, \u201cBut why is Big Brother short on money? He should have more money saved up than I do.\u201d She\u2019d occasionally spend money on makeup or luxurious items, but her brother didn\u2019t need any of them. Hrm, she knew that Dad had always been giving money to her brother behind her back. She was just never petty about it. Mom liked her more anyway.Fang JunRong said, \u201cAfter your father and I divorced, your father no longer had a house under his name and he didn\u2019t have enough cash in hand. So your brother shelled out a large sum for a large mansion.\u201dThey were not the kind who could adapt to a lesser lifestyle. Between the large mansion and the monthly salary for the servants, that about used up all of Li ShiZe\u2019s cash.\u201cAnd they moved Wang SiXian there as well.\u201d Fang JunRong added.Li XinYun didn\u2019t know about all those things. Now that she had found out, she was infuriated. Her face beet red, she said, \u201cI am going to block his number right now!\u201cUngrateful! White-eyed wolf! Unconscientious!\u201d said Li XinYun over and over again. Then she turned to Fang JunRong and reassured her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom. I would not be like Big Brother.\u201cFrom now on, I no longer have a brother!\u201d said Li XinYun determinately.She then went on to blocking Li ShiZe\u2019s number right in front of Fang JunRong. She thought about it some more and was still very annoyed. She unblocked him and sent a few texts over to shout at him before she blocked him one more time.Nothing Li ShiZe did at this point could hurt Fang JunRong. She has, after all, already given up on him. There would be no disappointment if there were no hope to begin with. Fang JunRong was, nevertheless, still very happy that her daughter was on her side.Fang JunRong still remembers this software that Li ShiZe had just developed. During the same timeframe in her previous life, she was still on good terms with Li ShiZe and had given him a lot of startup capital. Li ShiZe\u2019s software went to market smoothly, and he made a lot of money from it. And he was also able to befriend a very talented elite IT guy.Without her help during this lifetime and with his shortage in money, Fang JunRong was very curious to see whether Li ShiZe would still be able to achieve the same level of success as he did in her previous life.***As she was reminded by Xu WeiWei, Fang JunRong started paying attention to the variety show \u201cThe Fate of Antiques\u201d.Just to make sure that everything would go smoothly, she even had a word with the TV director. The TV director was an acquaintance of He JianBing plus Jiang YaGe has a certain draw so she was added to the show successfully.The advertisement never showed Jiang YaGe\u2019s face. It was covered up with pixels. The slogans that they used were very appealing as well.[Million-dollar gift at first meeting. How did this girl with both looks and talent appease the elderlies?][Expensive gift with love behind it. There is real love among prestigious families.]The melon-eating crowd were always curious about the lives of those in prestigious families. With the words \u201cprestigious families\u201d in the slogan, the number of clicks would naturally go up and up. That, on top of the part about her looks and talent, had brought out the viewers\u2019 desire for melon-eating. \u201cThe Fate of Antiques\u201d had always used provocative slogans to pique interest. But they rarely advertise falsely, which made the audiences even more excited.Many started speculating who this Miss could be. Even Li XinYun made it to the list of possible individuals. After all, she had just been on the top trended search list and Li WangJin was known to be an antique fanatic. That being said, Jiang YaGe was never mentioned. Even though her status wasn\u2019t a secret in her circle, she had never been officially introduced.All of a sudden, the popularity of the show shot up in everybody\u2019s speculation.Fang JunRong, too, turned her TV on at 8 PM with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She much preferred movies to variety TV shows. But, even she had to admit that there was a reason why this show had gained such popularity as of late. It certainly has its strong suits.Nevermind about anything else, the few regular people that were on the shows were quite interesting. She started watching the show for Jiang YaGe, but as the showed continued, she finished watching the entire episode without even realizing it. Jiang YaGe has yet to show up. It looked like the show had put her in the following episode, which would be aired right after this one.Speaking of, the host Zhou Yang had double checked with her whether she really wanted this aired. After all, if what Jiang YaGe said was true, it would be bad publicity for her. Fang JunRong calmly informed her that the painting was a gift from Li WangJin. Zhou Yang busted out laughing on the other side of the phone and never brought this up again.After the first episode was over, the commercials had started. The commercial time was quite long.She sliced herself up a plate of fruits to eat slowly. By now, Li XinYun and Zhong Yi had come home. The two of them had gone shopping together today. As Zhong Yi\u2019s grandmother had been recovering better than expected, Zhong Yi had been in a good mood as of late. Her school would be starting a few days after Li XinYun\u2019s, but as she had signed up to greet the new students, she would need to return to school on the 8th.The two of them sat down, one on each side of Fang JunRong, to watch TV with her.The next episode started after the commercials were over.Jiang YaGe came onto the show about halfway through the episode. She had paid a lot of attention to her appearance for the show. Her light makeup nicely accentuated her features and the white dress that she had on made her look pure and charming. Add those to her eyes that could tell their own stories, she was every bit as attractive as the host when standing next to her.Zhou Yang started with some compliments.Li XinYun was stunned. \u201cWhy is she on this show?\u201dFang JunRong lifted her chin and said, \u201cKeep watching and you will see.\u201dThe Jiang YaGe on TV put on a shy smile and started with her self-introduction before she pulled out the painting of beautiful women. Her eyelashes were long and made her look even more innocent on the camera.All the audiences on site gasped when she talked about how her parents had passed away and she was adopted by Li WangJin, who was a good friend of her parents. Li WangJin, after all, was quite well-known within the country.\u201cThis is one of Xu FangWeng\u2019s later works,\u201d said Jiang YaGe as she produced it. \u201cIt was also given to me as a gift the first time I met my adoptive mother.\u201dZhong Yi frowned and asked, \u201cWhat is she trying to pull?\u201d She brought the gift from her adoptive mother onto the show to be appraised? Did she not feel that that was very inappropriate? Jiang YaGe, her once good friend, was feeling more and more unfamiliar. She didn\u2019t know whether it was her who had changed a lot or that she has been too silly in the past to see the truth about her good friend. She had always thought of herself as somewhat intelligent, but in looking back, she had been nothing but a complete fool.Li XinYun sneered. \u201cPerhaps she just wanted the attention so she could join the entertainment circle.\u201dWithout knowing the whole story, the two kids only thought Jiang YaGe was after fame and popularity.\u201dOn the big screen, Jiang YaGe frowned a little. Her distress looked so authentic. \u201cI had always viewed this as a treasure. It represented how my adoptive mother thinks of me. It had calmed me shortly after I was there and became part of the family.\u201d\u201cYour adoptive mother is Fang JunRong, once the Young Miss of the Fang\u2019s, right?\u201d asked Zhou Yang with perfect timing.\u201cYes, my adoptive mother is someone that I have always looked up to. She is pretty and decorous, elegant and classy\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This painting was truly a birthday gift from her father to her mother, even though she couldn\u2019t quite remember when exactly that happened.Fang JunRong, her lips curved upward, snickered, \u201cI started feeling suspicious since he gave you that forgery. So I sent all the ones that he had given to me in the past to be appraised. Turned out they were all forgeries.\u201dLi XinYun was shocked beyond words. Her father had been giving her mother Xu FangWeng\u2019s works since a few years ago. That meant that he had already betrayed her way back then.As much as there was barely any feeling she had left for him after the forgery that she had received on her birthday, finding out about this had wiped away whatever that was left.They had now truly passed the point of no return.She suspected that her mother only divorced him with such alacrity because she was already aware of this. Her mother must have been hurt even more than she did.At that very moment, she even started to hate her father.***\u201cThe Fate of Antiques\u201d, as a high rating variety TV show, each episode has a very high popularity on the web. The appearance of Jiang YaGe had further pushed the show\u2019s rating through the roof. The comments on their official website grew exponentially.At the end of the episode, all the audiences saw how Jiang YaGe was crying on the show. They all turned into trolls and started fighting for Jiang YaGe in the commenting section.[Man, what has Jiang YaGe done to deserve that? The gift that she so treasured turned out to be a forgery!][Well, you don\u2019t know that for sure. Perhaps Fang JunRong was blind and bought the forgery by accident.][Oh, pffffft. What kind of person is Fang JunRong. She\u2019d for sure have someone appraised something like that before she buys then. She knew damn well whether it\u2019s real or it\u2019s a forgery.][I felt so bad for Jiang YaGe. She has trusted Fang JunRong so. Fang JunRong has gone too far on this. She was a CEO after all, how could she do that to a young girl? To think that I was such a fan of her. Fan no more!][Obviously it was an effort to insult Jiang YaGe. Saying that she was only worth a forgery. No wonder Boss Li wanted to divorce her. She deserves it!][I\u2019ve heard that she even got quite a bit from the divorce. What a shame. Boss Li is such a nice guy and YaGe looks up to him so much when she talks about him and says such good words about him. Fang JunRong is not good enough for Li WangJin.][Feel bad+1. She\u2019s truly so pretty. I felt my heart shattered into pieces when I saw her crying on TV.][Fang JunRong\u2019s company is going to launch a new line of skin-care products in a few days. I think it\u2019s called Beautify Pills. Blah, she\u2019s such an evil person. I wouldn\u2019t believe that the so-called Beautify Pills are real. It might have been mixed with ingredients that would damage your skin.][Boycott Fang JunRong! Boycott Meifang Corporation!]The two topics of \u201cFeeling bad for Jiang YaGe\u201d and \u201cBoycott Fang JunRong\u201d quickly made it into the most trended search list and continued to climb in its position.Many others visited Fang JunRong\u2019s Weibo. There were those who questioned her intent; there were those who hailed insults; then there were those who mocked her. Anything that one could think of. It was a live scene of a mad party for trolls.Both Li XinYun and Zhong Yi were infuriated. If only they weren\u2019t held back by Fang JunRong, they would have engaged with the netizens and duke it out with them already. Fang JunRong had also received a lot of calls from friends, but she explained away with a few words. She watched her ranking on the most trending list going up and up happily and even purchased the service to push them higher.These were all free advertisements!By the time \u201cFeeling bad for Jiang YaGe\u201d had reached the #1 spot, Fang JunRong finally released her Weibo post.[When Jiang YaGe first came to us, I had really looked forward to it. I even specifically asked Li WangJin what she would like as a gift. At the time, Li WangJin had told me that she likes things that are unique. Which was why I have decided to give her the painting of beautiful women from my own collection. That was a painting that was given to me by Li WangJin on my birthday just the year before that. I trust that anyone who had attended my birthday banquet that day would remember that. I\u2019d also like to find out how the painting turned out to be a forgery. Could someone give me an explanation on that as well? @Li WangJin @Ayron Corporation]All of the netizens who had been happily dissing Fang JunRong were stunned silent when they saw the Weibo post.The turn of events was so abrupt that they thought they might have injured their backs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They thought this was a story about a rich lady from a prestigious family bullying Cinderella behind the scene, but all of a sudden, this had turned into a show of going from friends to foes between a couple.Li WangJin, the male lead in the subject, was no stranger to them. Li WangJin was not the richest on the top wealthiest man list, but he was particularly fond of the image of a faithful and tender man, so he had spent quite some money on buying articles on creating that image for himself. As such, most had bought into that image that he had created for himself.A little while ago, when the news of the divorce between Li WangJin and Fang JunRong had spread, many of the netizens had a hard time believing it. Some even expressed that they had lost faith in love altogether. Li WangJin had spent money in suppressing the news that he had cheated on his wife, so only those in their circle knew about the incident. Most of the commoners just assumed that the two of them split due only to irreconcilable differences.After Jiang YaGe got onto the show, the public had further believed that they had found the real reason for the divorce \u2013 must be that Li WangJin had finally seen the real Fang JunRong and couldn\u2019t stand to be with her.Particularly when Jiang YaGe went on and on on the show about how nice Li WangJin was to her and treated her like his own daughter. That had further solidified people\u2019s belief in this matter. To a point that any of the other speculations that were far and in between were drowned out.Granted, all of these speculations were built upon the belief that Fang JunRong had purposefully given a counterfeit to Jiang YaGe. But when all was said and done, that counterfeit was given to Fang JunRong by Li WangJin?This melon stuffed all of the netizens till their faces turned green!The netizens did not question if this was just Fang JunRong\u2019s effort to shed her guilt. Fang JunRong had, after all, outright @ Li WangJin in her message, demanding an explanation from him.And that was how Fang JunRong was able to make a comeback from a near impossible position. With just one simple Weibo post, she was able to clear herself of any wrongdoings.And this was also when He JianBing decided to come and join in the fun. She posted a picture directly.[Giving a forgery to your own wife? Are you serious? @ Li WangJin]The picture was taken three years ago. Fang JunRong was wearing a maroon dress, her elegance was unrivaled. Behind her, there was the painting of the Beautiful Women. The exact same one that Jiang YaGe brought onto the show with her. From the decorations around them, it was obviously taken at a birthday banquet and the three-tiered birthday cake was very eye-catching.All the other wealthy guests who had attended the birthday banquet also posted related photos that they had taken as evidence. The development sided more and more with Fang JunRong. There were still a few devil\u2019s advocates who pointed out the possibilities that Fang JunRong might have received the authentic painting from Li WangJin, but then subsequently purchased a forgery to give to Jiang YaGe.This went on until female magnate Liang Feng posted a Weibo message with a photo. In the photo was of Xu FangWeng\u2019s Beautiful Women painting and alongside it was the appraisal document and auction documents.She said concisely, \u201cThe real painting of Beautiful Women is in my house and has been since I purchased it from an auction overseas eight years ago.\u201dAnd that was how the truth was nailed.All of the devil\u2019s advocates shut up. Liang Feng\u2019s words had, doubtless, nailed the coffin shut for Li WangJin.A few minutes later, she posted another message on Weibo.[I have never met Fang JunRong in person, but her reputation preceded her and I hope I will be able to meet her one day. How unfortunate that she had run into someone like Li WangJin.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this point in time, the turn of events came quickly. All the ones who had slammed Fang JunRong in the past all deleted their comments and flipped straight over to the other side.[OOOOOOHHHH! I apologize, Boss Fong! I had misunderstood you! I am so sorry! I will go and preorder a box of Beautify Pills!][Fang JunRong was the worst victim in this whole fiasco. Not only did her ex-husband give her a forgery, her adopted daughter was out to get her.][HAHAHA. I, who had never said a bad thing about Boss Fong, have come over to gloat! I had always thought that Jiang YaGe was a tramp. She went on the show to clear her adopted mother\u2019s name? If that really was her intention, she could just have someone appraised it privately. Was it necessary to go onto national TV for that? The truth was she was trying to set Fang JunRong up. Only girls understand other girls. My boyfriend said before that Jiang YaGe was so innocent and cute. I was so mad I gave him my cold shoulder.][Giving forgery to his wife was so out of character. Li WangJin was dead and his ashes scattered!][Say, when is Li WangJin going to respond?][Waiting for response. +1][Has anyone else noticed that Fang JunRong looks younger than she was three years ago? Alright, we are done talking. I am also going to pre-order a box of Beautify Pills!]\u2026\u2026Fang JunRong, looking at the changes in the direction of the public opinion online, raised her brows. She hadn\u2019t expected that Liang Feng, whom she had never met before, would speak it for her. Her original plan was that if Li WangJin denied it, then she\u2019d offer him the option of appraising the other paintings that he has on hand.But this wasn\u2019t a bad outcome. Not only was Li WangJin\u2019s nice guy character setting smashed in front of everyone, the incident also doubled as an advertisement for Beautify Pills. Within an hour, there were several thousands of preorders of Beautify Pills. It was much better than what she had imagined.The only thing that she needed now was to have someone who knew of the incident to step out and reveal the fact that Li WangJin had cheated on her. But, that wouldn\u2019t make sense, those in the business world care most about their own profits. Li WangJin had walked away with Aryon Corporation after the divorce. As the saying went, the camel that was starved to death was still bigger than the horse. With the exception of Sun Mei, very few were stupid enough to completely ruin their relationships with Li WangJin.But that was alright. She was a patient person. She was in no hurry.Fang JunRong smiled lightly, got up, and got ready to turn in.Li XinYun also yawned and walked out of her bedroom. Her nightgown in her hand, she looked like she was about to go take a shower.Fang JunRong asked, \u201cYou are still up at this hour? Are you going to be able to get up tomorrow morning?\u201dSomething wasn\u2019t right. Li XinYun had always adhered to a straight daily schedule. She usually got tired around 11 PM and would get ready for bed. It\u2019s already 12:30 AM now.She asked in a dubious tone, \u201cYou weren\u2019t engaging with the trolls online until now, were you?\u201d Something like that would not be above her daughter.Li XinYun froze for a little bit and said in a whiny voice. \u201cWhat those idiots have been saying were too infuriating!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but create some ten or so secondary accounts to fight with them. What was worse was that she lost the fights! She was even reported by them and had lost a few of her accounts. The thought of that displeased her even more. She decided that she\u2019d start practicing her online fighting skill starting tomorrow!Fang JunRong facepalmed. \u201cYou might as well just hire a water army to fight them. Why would you compete with them where you are the weakest?\u201d She knew her own daughter that she had raised very well. The worse terms she\u2019d use were \u201cidiots\u201d and \u201ctramps\u201d.Li XinYun was stunned: How come she didn\u2019t think of that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was at a loss. When she first got onto the show, she had also made her Weibo account public and gained tens of thousands of fans over the course of one night. She was quite complacent about that.Everybody was praising how kind she was under her Weibo account at the beginning and stood by her for her being bullied and being upset for her. They all scolded Fang JunRong.But in less than 2 hours, everything has changed. Ever since Fang JunRong had posted her Weibo, things had started sliding further and further down the direction that she didn\u2019t want it to go. As though falling into quicksand, the more she struggled, the worse it got.She looked very distressed, and her eyes were reddened. The feeling of regret had devoured her entirely. She sensed that she had done something bad to her adopted father, who had always been nice to her. It had never occurred to her that the painting was given to Fang JunRong by her adopted father.Why didn\u2019t Fang JunRong tell me? Or did she know this all along and just waited for her to make a fool out of herself? And this entire time, Fang JunRong had just been sitting back and laughing at her from afar?She had just been a little bit annoyed at what Fang JunRong had done to her and had a moment of weakness and wanted to get back at her a little. But now, she had come to realize that the arrow of her revenge seemed to have pointed in the wrong direction after all.Under her Weibo, most people were calling her a manipulative tramp. Saying that she was trying to set Fang JunRong up on purpose. There were a few who still defended her, but those were far and in between and were drowned in all the other messages. As happy as she was previously when she saw Fang JunRong being bashed by netizens online, she felt equally awful now that the same thing was happening to her.What was even worse was what would happen when her adopted father found out? What if he was so upset that he wanted to kick her out? She had already gotten used to her current lifestyle and would not be able to go back to her old one.She was nervous and anxious, but there was nothing that she could do.She wanted to post on Weibo and let everyone know that she wasn\u2019t a conniving person that they thought she was. But halfway through typing it out, she deleted it. She was under a lot of scrutiny from the netizens right now. She couldn\u2019t afford any bit of mistakes.There came a knocking sound.Jiang YaGe looked up immediately and stared at the door in fear.\u201cYaGe, open the door.\u201d It was Li ShiZe\u2019s voice coming from outside the door. His voice was deep. Within, there was a kind of anger that she had never heard before.Jiang YaGe\u2019s heart sank to the bottom. She wanted to run away but realized that there was nowhere for her to go.\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want me to force the door open with the key to your room.\u201dThe threatening voice stopped Jiang YaGe from her hesitation. She walked over to the door. The minute the door was opened, she immediately threw her arms around Li ShiZe and choked back on her tears. \u201cI am so sorry! I shouldn\u2019t have got onto that show!\u201dAll of Li ShiZe\u2019s anger was stuck at his throat. He was extremely angry tonight. He had a bad feeling as soon as he saw the episode when he was at work. He had a good memory. He clearly remembered that his father had given his mother that painting. And his father would eventually be dragged into this.His mother had been very nasty to him nowadays. She obviously no longer looked at him as her son. His father was the only person that he could lean on. Good or bad, they were now on the same boat.He didn\u2019t think that his mother would be so ruthless and just be blunt about it all. Had she not considered that he, too, would be affected if his father\u2019s name was smeared?He was equally angry at YaGe\u2019s stupidity.

I knew that painting was a counterfeit ahead of time. I was just so upset\u2026\u2026 I was so upset that even though she is your real mother, she was so mean to you, ignoring the difficulties that you are facing. That\u2019s why I wanted to teach her a small lesson.\u201cI am so sorry. This was my punishment for doing bad things that are against my nature. I never should have tried to do something like this.\u201dAll of Li ShiZe\u2019s anger dissipated immediately. He never thought that the always kind and gentle Jiang YaGe\u2019s very first evil act was all for him. Ever since he was a child, he had lived under his parents\u2019 halo. No matter how well he did, everybody else would look at it matter-of-factly. After all, he was the son of Li WangJin and Fang JunRong. He had the best education since he was a child. It was only right for him to be above everyone else.YaGe was the only one who saw him for who he was. She even stupidly tried to use her own way to protect him.He shouldn\u2019t have blamed her. If anything, it was his father\u2019s fault for trying to save that money and now he had to suffer the consequence.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d His voice had softened down.Jiang YaGe said frightfully, \u201cI worry that Dad would kick me out. I don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201dLi ShiZe immediately decided to give up on his father. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will protect you and not let him do anything to harm you.\u201d***Li WangJin knew nothing about this. Not even what was going on on Weibo.He went out networking yesterday and had inadvertently drank too much which made him sleep all the way until the afternoon of the next day. When he woke up, he felt that his head had been drilled by an electric drill. It hurts so much that his brows furrowed.He rubbed his temples, and it was the first time he missed Fang JunRong since the divorce. This rarely happened to him in the past as Fang JunRong would always give him medicine for over drinking whenever that happened to him.Bobbling his head, he looked over at the person lying next to him in bed. This was the woman that he had brought back with him last night. Her young and curvy body had brought him a lot of pleasure.His lips curved upward slowly until he looked at his cellphone. He was shocked by the 100+ unanswered calls. The sheer number of calls told him immediately that something had gone very wrong last night.He had muted his phone last night; plus, he had drunk too much and failed to notice.Li WangJin flipped through the call log. Many called him during that period of time \u2013 his assistant, shareholders of the company, and a few old friends scattered in between. He felt his heart sank and he immediately read the texts.As he read one text after another, he started piecing together the event that had taken place last night, and his hand that was holding his phone started to shake. He felt his stomach twisted into a knot, and he felt so ill that he wanted to vomit. He would never have thought that the normally very docile Jiang YaGe would ignore his words. She went on to the \u201cFate of Antiques\u201d show and revealed the truth that the painting was a counterfeit.Great. He was dragged right into this. And now the entire country had found out that he had gifted his ex-wife a counterfeit.What Li WangJin had tried so hard to hide had been revealed to all so publicly and so unexpectedly. It had turned him into the subject matter of everybody\u2019s conversation.An anger rose up from nowhere. He grabbed a cup from the table and smashed it into pieces. But that still didn\u2019t make him feel any better.If Jiang YaGe was standing in front of him right now, he would not hesitate to slap her across her face! What the heck was she thinking?!He took a deep breath and tried to suppress his anger. He called up the shareholder holding the second largest number of shares, who also happened to be an uncle of the Li\u2019s.\u201cWangJin, you need to take care of the event last night urgently and don\u2019t taint the image of the company. You will need to compensate everyone for their loss should the stock price drop.\u201dThe shareholder was so angry that he was no longer polite with Li WangJin.Li WangJin reassured him repeatedly that the best way to suppress the news was to drop the ranking of those few searches from the Most Trended List. Except that when he called the owner of the platform, they asked for an astronomical price.Everybody would want to kick you when you are down. Li WangJin was infuriated and smashed another cup.The noise woke up the woman next to him. She didn\u2019t even have a chance to whine to him before he had already put his clothes on and left. The woman was left behind, stunned while looking at his back before she started cussing him out. \u201cF*ck! He hasn\u2019t even paid me yet! Sh*t! The richer they are, the cheaper they are!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only thing in his mind was how to get through this incident. Once the owner of the real painting had stepped up, what he had gifted to Fang JunRong was for sure labeled as the counterfeit.He could not admit to that fact that he gave her a counterfeit purposefully. So his only option was to insist that he, too, was a victim. Something like that was not unheard of in the antique field.Nevertheless, when he looked under Fang JunRong\u2019s Weibo, he was about to have a stroke from anger.This morning, Fang JunRong had posted all of the paintings that he had given her in the past along with all the appraisal reports, proving that they were all counterfeits.Was she that eager to bury him alive? They may not be a couple anymore, but they still have a son and a daughter together. Couldn\u2019t she have held back for the sake of their children?He could no longer read the commentary under his Weibo page. All of the netizens were leaving him all sorts of nasty comments. After all, one counterfeit might be an accident, but all of them could not be easily explained away as accidents.That being so, he still had to bring himself to leave a post on Weibo. He started with expressing his love for the work of Xu FangWeng and followed up with how awful it was that others had taken advantage of his passion and lured him with counterfeit work. He went on about how he had been too trusting to inspect the work thoroughly. Finally, he was sorry about the trouble that he had caused his ex-wife.Beyond that, he would have to hand that over to the public relation team. At this point in time, even the best public relation team would not be able to save his nice guy persona.Welp. It was what it was. When the fact that he had cheated on Fang JunRong was exposed, the public opinions against him would be even worse.Li WangJin could only comfort himself that way. He would just have to go along with it right now.Even though he had put a lot of work into controlling his emotions, once he got home and saw Jiang YaGe sitting there like nothing had happened, he was enraged all over again. Ever since Jiang YaGe has returned, she had been causing him troubles left and right. First, she had offended Wang Xiao. Now, she had caused damage to his public persona. As much as he had spoiled her rotten in the past, it was difficult to continue to dote on her with all the damages that she had caused him.It might have been different if Jiang YaGe was apologetic about what she had done, but she had a spring-is-in-the-air look on her. It was obvious that she was in a fairly good mood.That infuriated Li WangJin even more!Jiang YaGe was startled when she saw Li WangJin. The incident the night before had brought her closer to Li ShiZe. The two even went as far as having intimacy after they were intoxicated the night before. She now saw herself as Li ShiZe\u2019s girlfriend, and she couldn\u2019t be happier to the point that she had forgotten about what was going on online. She finally remembered it when she saw Li WangJin, and she was a little worried.\u201cDad\u2026.\u201d She was intimidated.\u201cI don\u2019t think I am good enough to be your dad. You have a lot of ideas now and would go behind my back to do what you\u2019ve promised me that you wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Li WangJin coldly. He had been fairly good to Jiang YaGe for the sake of Wang SiEr and how she had repaid him for his kindness? Sure enough, Jiang YaGe didn\u2019t measure up to a fraction of who her mother was.That accusation hurt too much. Tears started rolling down her face. \u201cI\u2026 I am sorry\u2026I had your best interest in mind. I didn\u2019t think it would lead to this.\u201d In her mind, she felt that this was part of Li WangJin\u2019s fault. He was so rich but still carried out trickeries like this so unnecessarily and now even negatively impacted her.If everything had gone the way that it should, she might have been able to gain some popularity online and maybe earn the title of a Young Miss.\u201cAre you saying that this was my fault?\u201d asked Li WangJin angrily.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d said Jiang YaGe, feeling unjust.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His tie wasn\u2019t completely tied yet, giving him an unruly look. When he saw the angry look on his father and Jiang YaGe with her water eyes, his face dropped right away.He took a step forward and stood in front of Jiang YaGe in a protective stance. \u201cDad, what are you doing to YaGe? Are you blaming her? You are the one who is at fault here. YaGe was the innocent one. How can you be blaming her?\u201dSeeing him coming out of the Jiang YaGe\u2019s room, Li WangJin\u2019s eyeballs were about to pop out of his sockets from anger. \u201cWhat is the relationship between the two of you?\u201d Even though Li WangJin had doted on Jiang YaGe as though she was his daughter, it had never crossed his mind for her to become his daughter-in-law. Li ShiZe was his very important son, and he\u2019d need to marry someone who was worthy of him in the future. Not someone like Jiang YaGe who\u2019d only hold him back.After all, daughters and daughters-in-law were not the same.That thought was especially true now that his son was taking a stance against him for her. This double whammy made all of Li WangJin\u2019s blood rush to his head, and he almost couldn\u2019t remain standing upright.Li ShiZe said loudly and clearly, \u201cShe is my girlfriend.\u201cI would not let anyone hurt her and that includes you.\u201dLi WangJin almost spit out a mouthful of blood. He looked at his cold son in disbelief and clutched his own chest.\u201cYou\u2026both of you get the h*ll out of here!\u201dWhat kind of a person was Li ShiZe? His entire life had gone smoothly with no hardships whatsoever. He immediately struck back. \u201cI bought this house.\u201d The subtext was, this was his house and if anyone must leave, that would be Li WangJin. He didn\u2019t even have startup capital because of this house.Li WangJin could not believe how unfilial Li ShiZe was. His eyes widened, and then everything went black in front of his eyes. He had passed out.Everything was hectic after that.***Fang JunRong knew nothing of the drama that had just taken place at the Li\u2019s. She frowned upon reading the explanation from Li WangJin. Not even a three-year-old would believe in his cruddy excuse.Li WangJin obviously was well aware of this as well, which was why he straight up locked the commenting section under Weibo, so he didn\u2019t have to look at them. It might have kept his Weibo page nice and clean, but the netizens, not having an outlet for their opinion, went straight to Ayron\u2019s official Weibo.Fang JunRong, who had been watching everything unfold like a joke, focused a lot of her energy in the company. According to its official website, pre-orders of Beautify Pills has already reached 20,000 units. That was way more than they had originally anticipated.Sun Mei even gave her a call and asked whether she\u2019d need some help advocating about how Li WangJin had cheated on her.To a certain extent, Sun Mei was an interesting character. Even though she had previously spread the words about Li WangJin\u2019s cheating all over the place, she had smartly never sent the video clip to anyone else. At most, she\u2019d show it to them. At this point in time, Fang JunRong and herself were the only two individuals who have a copy of the video clip.That was probably why she was still scot-free up to this point.Fang JunRong thought about it for a little bit and said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait on that. Wait until I am launching my next new product.\u201dShe has already viewed Li WangJin as her free marketing scheme by now.Granted, she had also promised Sun Mei that she would give her internal-only Beautify Pills when the time came. The products online were made of mystical spring water that was diluted 10 folds and even the internal version was diluted 5 folds. That was part of the reason why Sun Mei had flipped sides and befriended Fang JunRong now.On September 8th, Beautify Pills was launched officially. That was also the first day of school for Li XinYun. Fang JunRong had further announced that there would be a 10% discount across the board to celebrate the first day of school for her daughter. The discount would be for one day only, and the discount would also be applied to any pre-orders that were placed before today.Even though 10% off wasn\u2019t a lot, it did stimulate the sales a little. By September 9, they had sold around 40,000 boxes of Beautify Pills.It only took one round of treatment with the Beautify Pills for the result to show. Seven days later, when the words of mouths spread, there would be no worries about the sales. All in all, this was a good start, and it was mostly attributed to Li WangJin and Jiang YaGe.Had they not done what they\u2019ve done, she\u2019d have to spend money on advertisement.She thought about it for a little bit, unblocked Li WangJin temporarily, and sent him a text.[I want to thank you and Jiang YaGe for sacrificing yourself to save me the advertisement cost. Just for that, I have decided to temporarily forgive everything that you have done to me in the past. You two are too nice.]Finally, she was able to collect on some interest from her previous life.After she sent the text, she blocked Li WangJin all over again and felt much better.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked around. Lao Sun, his chauffeur, was the only one there looking after him. Neither his unfilial son nor Jiang YaGe could be seen anywhere.Recalling the incident before he lost consciousness, he felt his chest tightening again. All the anger returned at once, and his voice was gloomy when he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s that evil spawn of mine?\u201dOne could tell from his word choice of \u201cevil spawn\u201d how angry he was this time.Hearing that, Lao Sun had on an awkward look. \u201cYoung Master left with Young Miss. He thought you feigned your fainting.\u201dIt was Lao Sun who finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and took his boss to the hospital.Li WangJin was so angry that his face turned beet red. He felt that if he had died, it would be from anger caused by his unfilial son. When he was going through the divorce with Fang JunRong, Li ShiZe would stand on his side as he defended Jiang YaGe. He had enjoyed that so back then. Now that he had become Li ShiZe\u2019s target, he couldn\u2019t even describe how that made him feel.At this very moment, his feelings had oddly overlapped with that of Fang JunRong\u2019s in her previous life.How was it that the son that he had always been proud of turned into someone so unrecognizable?Li ShiZe was his own son. He couldn\u2019t even outright disown him. As for Li XinYun, she was a daughter. Li WangJin never considered her as an option to be a successor.If disowning Li ShiZe wasn\u2019t an option, he\u2019d have to educate him.He snickered. That son of his. He thought he was strong enough now to treat his own father this way? Then, it\u2019s time to let him know that he was just a nobody without the status as the successor of Ayron Corporation.The company had finally made some profit in the last couple of weeks and money finally wasn\u2019t as tight as it was before. With the pressure of finance being lifted some, he was now able to spare some time in teaching his unruly son a lesson.He made a few calls and gave his commands coldly.\u201cFreeze all of his cards.\u201dHe wanted to see what else he could do without money! And then there\u2019s that Jiang YaGe\u2026He, once again, recalled the look of Wang SiEr. She was smiling tendering at him in his memory, as though she was lending him support wordlessly.As much as Jiang YaGe looked like her mother, in the end, she didn\u2019t not have her mother\u2019s sparkling personality. She had the appearance, but not what was inside. She even instigated his son to go against him. He trusted that even Wang SiEr would be very sad if she knew that her daughter had turned out like this.Then he thought about Wang SiXian. She too, was a pitiful person. She had lost her beauty because of Jiang YaGe. She now stayed quietly at the hospital everyday like a body without its soul.He was suddenly startled. In certain perspective, Jiang YaGe was a sh*t magnet. Her parents died in an accident; her aunt lost her beauty because of her; even Wang Xiao, whom she only met for the first time, turned into a handicapped person because of her, which had subsequently brought about his series of revenge. And, ever since he had adopted her, his business at his company hadn\u2019t been as good as it was before and he further ran into one issue after another. On the flip side, Fang JunRong, who had a poor relationship with Jiang YaGe was getting better and better by the day. Her stupid Beautify Pills was super popular the day it was launched.Perhaps, adopting her was the first of his mistakes. It was time to put a stop to his loss.A cold look flashed past his eyes. Ny now, he had completely forgotten how excited he was for Jiang YaGe to join them just two months ago.Suddenly, his cellphone vibrated. He looked down at it. It was a text from Fang JunRong. He hesitated for a little bit before he clicked it open and read it.After he read the content of the text, veins could be seen throbbing on his forehead.\u201cHow dare she!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t have high hopes on it, but thought she\u2019d just give it a try anyway. She was prepared that this would be a long journey. She never would have thought that Jiang WenYu would be able to deliver her such great news in less than a month.The Zhang\u2019s in her previous life had totally taken this pearl as fish\u2019s eyeball.Wonderful. Now this pearl belonged to her!With her looking at her that way, Jiang WenYu felt oddly embarrassed and felt that his ears were burning a little. With a slight blush on his face, he suppressed his peculiar emotion and refocused on the task at hand. He said to her seriously, \u201cYes, I have noticed that qixing and qingxia will survive if you place some gems around them and not die off in three days like they used to.\u201dTruth was, he only figured that out because of the jade that he had been wearing all the time. He had tried many different ways previously but neither the qixing nor the qingxia survived more than three days with the exception of the one that he brought around with him day in and day out studying it.Jiang WenYu knew that his jade necklace had special abilities, so he took it off to research it some more. Sure enough, when the two types of plants were around his necklace, they would be able to survive. He continued with his experimentation and learned that it didn\u2019t have to be his necklace, any other types of gemstones would work as well, though the effect wasn\u2019t as significant. The higher quality the gem, the better the result. As to where Fang JunRong found these two plants from, he had no intention to ask.He omitted the part about his own necklace when he recounted his experience to Fang JunRong.After Fang JunRong had heard him, she had on her a big smile. She has no shortage of gemstones! She even bought a lot more right before the divorce just to mess with Li WangJin. Interesting how they became useful now.She thought about it for a little bit and said, \u201cWe can try planting them in a field to test out your theory. Let\u2019s just make sure we bury the gemstones way deep.\u201dEven if others could steal the plants, they wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out the ways to grow them. She suspected that gems themselves possessed some sort of mystical qi. They may not be strong, but still enough to support these two types of plants. It would be a lot of investment at the beginning, but compared to the benefits that they would eventually reap, this was nothing.\u201cYou have been working so hard lately. Thank you so much,\u201d said Fang JunRong with her deepest sincerity. She decided to give Jiang WenYu a big raise.Jiang WenYu, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t too happy with his finding. Frowning slightly, he said, \u201cStill not enough. They may be able to survive, but the active ingredients in them are of a lower quality and the final products also aren\u2019t as good as yours.\u201dFang JunRong felt a little bit ashamed of herself. All she could say was that Jiang WenYu had a higher standard than she did. All she wanted to do was to be able to mass produce the three types of medications, so they would benefit more people.She remembered the white jade cream. Yunying (previously astragalus sinicus), required for the making of white jade cream, was also from the dimension. Perhaps, they could try to grow it using the same method.She\u2019d leave that to the professional. Fang JunRong had a lot of faith in Jiang WenYu on this matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Speaking of, Jiang WenYu\u2019s family, the Jiang\u2019s, as medical doctors for generations, also have formulas that have been passed down for several hundreds of years. One of the most famous one was their Bone-Reattaching Cream. Their effects were unquestionable but also extremely expensive. A small bottle of one would run upwards of 10,000 yuan. Not a small amount for a normal family. The Jiang\u2019s had been very established over the years from the profit of this product.Fang JunRong trusted that her White Jade Cream could only be better than their Bone-Reattaching Cream. When her product hit the market, she\u2019d sell them for cheaper than theirs just to spite them. She hasn\u2019t forgotten how Zhang Bi poisoned her in her previous life and made her a very mentally unstable person.***Right this moment, Jiang YaGe was at work. After school had started, she found a job as a tutor for a high school student through a fellow schoolmate in her activity club to make some extra money. That was the last resort. She didn\u2019t think that Li WangJin would be so upset that he even stopped hers and Li ShiZe\u2019s credit cards.ShiZe didn\u2019t have a lot of cash lately and was busy looking for investors. As a very considerate girlfriend, naturally Jiang YaGe couldn\u2019t be more of a burden for him and should at least earn her own expenses. She even sold off a few of her purses as his start up capital. Unfortunately, they were but a drop in a bucket.She recalled her lifestyle just a month ago. It was still clear in her head. Going from a lavish lifestyle back to a frugal one is dangerous. She found her frugal lifestyle particularly difficult now. She had no choice but to encourage herself: ShiZe was mighty. Once his career started to take off, they could go back to their previous lifestyle.No, wait. That wasn\u2019t why she was dating him. She truly liked him as a person.She dragged her exhausted body back to the dormitory. The soundproofing of the dormitory wasn\u2019t that great. She could hear the cheerful voices of her roommates.\u201cYan-er, your skin looked so much better than it was before! Is that really the effect of the Beautify Pills? Had I known, I would have gotten one myself too! They were already sold out on their official website. It will be another week before more becomes available.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve spent every penny I made over summer on this. I got three boxes!\u201d Jiang YaGe\u2019s roommate bragged contently.\u201cSay, should we ask YaGe? Isn\u2019t she the Li\u2019s adopted daughter? Maybe she can help us get some.\u201d\u201cYeah, right. Haven\u2019t you seen all the drama on Weibo? Jiang YaGe\u2019s relationship with that Boss Fang was awful, alright? Why else would she get on the show trying to set her up? She looks so innocent normally but is so conniving deep down inside. Boss Fang had already adopted her and that was her way of repaying her.\u201d\u201cBoss Fang doesn\u2019t recognize her as her adopted daughter, she only recognizes Zhong Yi. Look at Zhong Yi now. She is so different than she was last semester. Now she walks and talks like a lady from a prestigious family. And look at Jiang YaGe, she still has to work part-time for money. You can figure out her status at the Li\u2019s.\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s hand that was resting on the doorknob trembled and tears came rolling down her cheeks. No, that wasn\u2019t who she was. They didn\u2019t know anything. They only spoke kindly of Fang JunRong because she was rich.Society is too cruel.She couldn\u2019t stay in this dormitory any longer.She turned to leave and ran all the way to Li ShiZe\u2019s office. It\u2019s been a few days since she had last seen him. He was good-looking and handsome as usual, but his aura had changed a lot. He was elegant and prideful in the past and always calmed and charming no matter what happened. Now, with all the recent obstacles that he had been running into and all the hardships, he was irritable and ill-tempered.The halo that had been shining down on him seemed to have dimmed.\u201cYage.\u201d Li ShiZe looked up at her and his eyes were bloodshot.He was a privileged one. Him becoming like this for her made her feel both proud and disappointed. The Li ShiZe that she liked was the confident and mighty one.Sniffling, she looked fragile and heart-broken in front of him as she said to him, \u201cShiZe, why don\u2019t you go home? Apologize to Dad and Mom. You are their son. They wouldn\u2019t really disown you. I don\u2019t want to see you like this because of me. You are a prideful male eagle and shouldn\u2019t break your wings because of me. It is my fault. I am pulling you down.\u201dShe had to choke back tears toward the end but her voice was very decisive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was stroking her very smooth and flawless cheeks. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.Ever since her teenage years, she always had pimples. She had tried different kinds of pills and skincare products but nothing seemed to help. And, she didn\u2019t know any better when she was young and would always pop her pimples. That had left a lot of pockmarks on her face. She wasn\u2019t bad looking, but the pockmarks made it difficult to see that. It had given her an inferiority complex. She had spent a lot of money over the years, but nothing was effective in improving her skin condition.That was until she saw the drama between Jiang YaGe and Fang JunRong unfolded on the web. She was in the same class as Jiang YaGe and never liked her much. Every time when it was their turn to do the cleaning, Jiang YaGe would always pick the easiest of all tasks. When they didn\u2019t do a good enough job and were criticized, everybody would say she did a bad job. Nobody had ever once said that Jiang YaGe was in the wrong. That was all because Jiang YaGe was pretty and was the type that men liked.That was why she pulled the trigger and placed the order for three boxes of Beautify Pills when she saw that Fang JunRong\u2019s company had released the product. Her parents doted on her and provided her with plenty of cash for school. She could afford three boxes if she just tightened her belt a little. She already liked Fang JunRong\u2019s company just from the fact that they had given Jiang YaGe a bad time.She was only going to try it first, but the result after a week had exceeded her expectations. The pockmarks on her face had become much lighter in color. Even her skin tone had become a few shades lighter and she had become more attractive instantly. What sort of magical pills were these?888 yuan was a steal. It was practically the price of a liquidation sale. These pills were worth at least another 0 at the end of their price.After she had finished appreciating her look in the mirror, she quickly fished out her cellphone and wanted to order another five boxes. Unfortunately, when she navigated to the official site, all she saw was that they were all sold out. She was gravely disappointed.\u201cWhy did Meifong sell so little of them? They need to replenish their inventory!\u201dAfter she had griped about it some, her hand seemed to have a mind of its own. She went into her account and confirmed receipt of the products before she left a 5-star rating and a long review singing the praises of the Beauty Pills. Of course, she did not forget to urge them on the official site to quickly restock. She wanted to buy more to share with her friends and family.Luckily, she still has two more boxes of them. By the time she finished her two remaining boxes, all of the pockmarks on her face should be gone and she\u2019d truly have flawless skin.Humming, she walked out of the bathroom.Her roommates came up and surrounded her as they all asked at the same time.\u201cMeiHua, do you have any more of those Beautify Pills? I will buy a box from you. I am offering you 12x the price that you\u2019ve paid!\u201d\u201cAnd I am offering you 15x!\u201dYang MieHua\u2019s lips twitched, and she said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys say I was paying IQ tax when I placed my order?\u201d\u201cYou have such great insights. How could we ever measure up to you? Pretty please? I will be going to ComicCon next month and I will be cosplaying. I need to go there with my best self!\u201dEverybody surrounded her, flattered her, and they have all given MeiHua a big head. Except that she couldn\u2019t part with the pills herself as well\u2026 As for the amount that they were offering, that she didn\u2019t care about. Instead of money, her relationship with her roommates was more important.She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cYou know that my skin isn\u2019t as good as yours, so I need to continue the treatment. I can\u2019t spare more than 1 box.\u201d\u201cOOOOOOOH! Starting from today, you are my real sister from different parents!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Rebirth of the Evil Mother-In-Lawchapter 101Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Yang MeiHua had given them a box of her Beautify Pills, she suddenly thought of something else. She took an apple out of the closet and headed over to Jiang YaGe\u2019s dormitory to wait for Jiang YaGe.After Jiang YaGe\u2019s roommate found out why she was there, she chuckled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think she will be back. She\u2019s a Young Miss now. Why would she live in the crowded dormitory with us?\u201cShe\u2019s being dropped off and picked up by some luxurious car when she comes to school nowadays.\u201dYang MeiHua made a \u201ctsk\u201d sound and decided to go back to her own dormitory. Li Yan, Jiang YaGe\u2019s roommate also used the Beautify Pills just like her, and the effect was very noticeable. The two of them, with something in common, started chatting about it. Particularly when Yang MeiHua brought up how she decisively placed the order for Meifang Corporation\u2019s Beautify Pills. Every time that subject came up, she couldn\u2019t help but start raving about it all over again.Her raving made all the other female students very regretful and wished that they had purchased a few extra boxes at the time.Just when they were happily chatting away, there came a knocking sound.They turned their heads and saw Jiang YaGe. With a huge luggage in tow, she stood outside of the dorm room. Her eyes were reddened like that of a bunny\u2019s as though she had been crying.Seeing them, Jiang YaGe pulled back the corners of her lips a little and said, \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dHer voice was weak and nowhere as lively as it used to be.Jiang YaGe\u2019s roommates looked at each other, and one of them asked, \u201cAre you moving back into the dormitory?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but exchange a look with all the other girls. Why would Jiang YaGe move back into the dormitory when she could be living in a mansion?When she left previously, she had brought with her everything from the dormitory.\u201cYeah, to save on my commute time,\u201d said Jiang YaGe weakly. \u201cMy grades had been slipping a lot and I need to focus more on my studying.\u201d The truth was she had broken up with Li ShiZe.If they didn\u2019t break up, her adopted father would not unfreeze their credit cards. Jiang YaGe didn\u2019t want to go back to working in places like White Crane, nor did she want to see the strapping man whom she loves having to struggle in his day-to-day life.Fang JunRong wouldn\u2019t allow their relationship and neither would Li WangJin.For the sake of their future, she was willing to suck it up and sacrifice herself. She trusted that Li ShiZe would not let her sacrifice go in vain in the days to come.As much as she had prepared herself, her self-esteem was still hurt when she saw the surprised looks from her roommates with a hint of mockery under them.She spotted Yang MeiHua, who was now sitting on her old chair.Yang MeiHua recollected herself, stood up, smiled brightly and said, \u201cOh yeah, I was here looking for you today.\u201dShe walked in front of Jiang YaGe and shoved the apple into her hand. \u201cHere\u2019s a gift for you.\u201dJiang YaGe paused for a little. She couldn\u2019t remember when she had helped out Yang MeiHua, but she gave her habitual smile. \u201cThat\u2019s no problem at all. Glad I could help.\u201dYang MeiHua almost busted out laughing. She nodded solemnly and said, \u201cYeah, I am so glad you had that big fight with Boss Fang. Her products would not have otherwise been brought to my attention. Let me tell you, her Beautify Pills can work wonders! Thank you so much for your advertisement!\u201dJiang YaGe\u2019s smile froze on her face. She never expected it was for something like that. She felt that everybody was looking at her, and there was obvious sarcasm in their eyes. She almost started crying all over again. She was the victim of her adopted father; so why were they looking at her like that?She felt that she couldn\u2019t stay here, but she had just broken up with Li ShiZe and couldn\u2019t possibly go back. All of a sudden, Jiang YaGe wasn\u2019t sure what other options she had.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
