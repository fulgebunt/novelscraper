Hickson just so happened to create a good opportunity, and she decided to make full use of it.\u201cVixen was trained as a secret killer. So, he doesn\u2019t fit in a battle in a place like this.\u201dVixen\u2019s trick is a covert surprise. In broad daylight of the \u2018let\u2019s fight each other!\u2019 situation, he learned the art of daggers that didn\u2019t fit the battle he\u2019s fighting with.\u201cOn the other hand, uncle\u2019s sword is a dominant sword. Now that Tundra has learned uncle\u2019s sword style, he\u2019ll have an advantage in this open battle.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d\u201cAs things stand, uncle seems to like Tundra?\u201d\u201cNevertheless, you still think that Vixen will win?\u201dViola nodded and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not up to Vixen in proficiency yet.\u201dNo matter how much of a genius Tundra is, in Viola\u2019s mind, the differences in their training period are too high. In the end, she concluded her thoughts.\u201cSo, if he doesn\u2019t make an obvious mistake, Vixen will win.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by an obvious mistake?\u201d\u201cSuddenly getting too excited to make a big move.\u201d\u201cLike being drunk?\u201dAt that, Hickson laughed loudly.\u201cIf he is caught off guard and shows a gap on purpose\u2026 There might be a case like that. Since Vixen is still young, and from his personality, he thinks this is a game. So, there\u2019s a chance for Tundra.\u201dHearing her words, he gazed at Viola for some time, bewildered.\u201cWhat? Is there something wrong with my face?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d He said, giggled softly before straightening himself.\u201cViola.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBe honest with me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cSeven.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not seven, are you? You look young, but you are actually not?\u201dA seven-year-old that is actually older?\u2018I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019To be fair, Viola is a little stingy, anyway. But it is true because she was a twenty-one-year-old inside, though she couldn\u2019t really advertise that.It was then,\u201cUwaah!\u201dA shout resounded.\u201cUwaah!\u201dTundra swung the wooden sword loudly.Whoosh!The sword tore through the air as Vixen laughed after lightly dodging Tundra\u2019s wooden sword. \u201cHehe. He\u2019s still clumsy!\u201dHis movement is too big. Even though Tundra is fast, it quickly consumes his physical strength. Realizing this fact, Vixen was smirking happily.\u2018I could see an opening.\u2019If he pokes it, it\u2019s over.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t poke him.\u201dFor Vixen, Tundra is an easy opponent. A novice with a lot of openings. Even Tundra knew that fact himself, and that made him furious.\u2018Damn it!\u2019His desire to win as a male lead was radiated. As he gets more excited, his body movements get bigger, and his body uses more strength. In the end, the more he swung, the more advantageous it was for Vixen.It was then, at the corner of his eyes, Tundra saw Viola and Hickson talking to each other.\u2018\u2026Master?\u2019\u2018Viola!\u2019Tundra and Vixen discovered Viola almost at the same time. And, they had different thoughts.\u201cI can\u2019t show her disappointment.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll show you how strong I am.\u201dRather, Tundra regained its reason. His head became cold, and he let go of some of his strength.\u2018I\u2019m not as good as him at this. That\u2019s why I have to aim for his gap.\u2019Now, it was Vixen who was off guard.\u2018There\u2019s only one chance. That little crack\u2026 that little crack\u2026\u2019That\u2019s where he\u2019s going to attack. Tundra realized that he\u2019d only get one shot. His reasoning subsided coldly. In contrast, now that Tundra is getting calm and collected, Vixen became a little excited.\u2018Because I\u2019m her older brother!\u2019Since he is older than her, Vixen wanted to show his strong side in front of Viola.\u2018Let\u2019s get it over in one go, then.\u2019In his mind, Tundra is just an underdog, and he could finish him at any time.Pride and carelessness.Mixed with the desire to look good to Viola, at that moment, his body is full of energy. Tundra bit his lip.\u2018He\u2019s coming.\u2019As Vixen\u2019s movement is bigger than before. He could see through his movements and the openings. Tundra took a left and narrowed the distance between themselves. And, at that moment, he seized the opportunity.The boy swung the wooden sword quickly.Snap!Something got caught in the wooden sword.\u201cStop.\u201dStepping in between Tundra and Vixen, Hickson grabbed Tundra\u2019s wooden sword with one hand and held Vixen\u2019s dagger with the other.\u201cIt\u2019s a draw.\u201dObviously, Vixen is unable to accept such a result. He yelled immediately, \u201cNo way!\u201dTundra then chimed in.\u201cWhat?! This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d\u201cI could have stabbed him in the heart!\u201d\u201cAnd, you\u2019d be decapitated instead. Did you forget? This is a longsword.\u201dIf it were a real sword match, Tundra would have been penetrated in the heart, while Vixen would have been decapitated.\u201cI knew that! I was going to avoid it!\u201d\u201cYes, of course, you knew,\u201d Hickson said, hitting Vixen, who was still yelling in the head.Bam!There was a sound.Even though Hickson thought that he was just hitting him lightly, the sound everyone heard sounded like a car accident.Vixen was upset.\u201cWhy are you hitting me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes were filled with life, angry.\u201cWhat?\u201dAgain, he hit Vixen on the head.Within the Verratoux Family, the only person who is able to hold the head of Verratoux Family pure blood is Hickson.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u201cAs much as you can.\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2019m seriously going to kill you.\u201dHickson scoffed loudly.\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be interesting?.\u201dLooking at the scene, Viola sighed unconsciously. That joke that came out, needless to say, was all true. Still, both were enjoying the situation, so she decided to step in.\u201cVixen.\u201d\u201cViola, it\u2019s not like I lost. Let me tell you what happened\u2026\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dViola then pulled a piece of paper out of her arms.\u201cHuh? A contract?\u201dPeering at it, he realized it was a contract to grant wishes, which he had signed with blood earlier on.\u201cNo matter how strong you are, you can\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s my wish.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAs Vixen glanced at the contract, his expression changed. However, his action still seemed unconvincing, so Viola opened her mouth again.\u201cAre you not going to follow through on the contract, brother?\u201d\u201cHa. I\u2019ll do it\u2026\u201dVixen couldn\u2019t hide his expression. Even if it seemed unfair, he couldn\u2019t help it.Vixen is a real do-it-it-all, and he\u2019s still young, so he\u2019ll go through stormy growth. Therefore, if he really happens to kill Tundra, a problem would arise. The male lead, who will be the centerpiece of this novel, will also disappear.\u2018I can\u2019t let him do that. The male lead needs to grow up great.\u2019So, she would ride the first princess line with the male character. That way, Viola will be able to stabilize this duke and transform this duchy full of life. She couldn\u2019t let this perfect plan be ruined.She said, \u201cKeep your words.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cSince you are my brother, you will do that, right?\u201d\u201cO-of course.\u201d\u201cThen, you\u2019ll keep your promise, right?\u201d\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201dAlthough it felt like he was being cheated, Vixen couldn\u2019t deny that Viola was not wrong.As an older brother, shouldn\u2019t he keep his promise? If he doesn\u2019t keep his promise that is on the contract, his prestige as a Verratoux won\u2019t stand.Meanwhile, Tundra bowed his head quietly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to show you my shameful face. I wanted to win\u2026\u201dHearing his words, Viola turned and stared at every inch of his face. There are some small scratches, but there was no major wound visible.\u201cNo, you did a good job. I\u2019m fine as long as you\u2019re not hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTundra bowed his head once again.\u2018Good job\u2026\u2019In fact, he is a little pleased with this remark.\u2018As long as you\u2019re not hurt.\u2019Those words were very pleasing. He doesn\u2019t know the reason. He doesn\u2019t know why it felt so good to hear that she doesn\u2019t want him hurt.\u2018\u2026I have to do well.\u2019With that in mind, he was determined to do better so that he will be able to defeat Vixen one day.Tundra saw a possibility today. Even though it may take some time, he wanted to be praised more, so he must be stronger than Vixen\u2026Tundra and Vixen\u2019s eyes met in the air.\u201cTo do that\u2026 I might have to kill you, Vixen.\u201dVixen also did not shy away from Tundra\u2019s eyes.He scoffed and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you. Mixed species.\u201dTo be honest, Vixen was angry seeing Viola praising her dog for doing well. He doesn\u2019t understand why, but he didn\u2019t like it.\u2018Why did she only praise the dog?\u2019He wants to get a compliment from her, too\u2026Frustrated, the thought kept on going. Viola didn\u2019t even ask him if he was hurt or not as well. He fought with a dagger as well!The sound of his heart resonated, but Vixen didn\u2019t hear it.\u2018It\u2019s annoying.\u2019He just thought he was annoyed at her for no reason.Tundra went closer to Viola.\u201cBy the way, Master\u2026\u201dHe knelt down on one knee. It looked like a young knight taking his oath as his eyes were filled with an unidentified, powerful longing.Tundra was like a dog who strongly craved snacks.A few days ago, Tundra witnessed a shocking scene.A big dog with gold fur.It was a scene in which a lady, who was presumed to be the owner, looked at the barking dog and grabbed the hem of her clothes. However, what\u2019s even more surprising is that the lady gazed at the dog as if it seems rather cute.The dog even licked the lady\u2019s face. It was a devastating scene for Tundra.\u2018I don\u2019t understand why\u2026\u2019Common sense had never made sense for him. Thus, Tundra secretly bought a book called\u00a0<b>\u300c Ultimate Guide for Dogs Language \u300d</b>\u00a0considered to be the exclusive possession of the ladies.And, the content is full of shocking information.\u2018Dogs beg the master to play\u2026?\u2019The scene of the dog biting and shaking her clothes was the scene of it begging the owner to play.\u2018\u2026Now, he\u2019s begging for a snack?\u2019It is also said that the behavior of the dog depends on its characteristics and education. Some dogs lie down and peep at their owners with adorable eyes, others bark at their owners for snacks, and the rest simply just lie down and protest.Sometimes they can be upset and happy, sometimes their emotions are unfiltered.Then, Tundra realized a new fact.\u2019This is what a dog is\u2026.!\u2019They are creatures that begged to play, protested, whined, wagged their tail, acted cute, annoyed to get snacks, and interacted emotionally with their owner.\u2018Ah. It\u2019s a lot more different than I thought\u2026\u2019That was when he got to know the new word.And from that day on, his dream is to become a pet dog.\u201cBy the way, Master\u2026\u201d He said, kneeling down on one knee.\u2018What is it?\u2019That desperateness is enough to make Viola sting. He had a serious look that almost looked like a reverence, and then he finally uttered something.\u201cI\u2019ll be a good dog\u2026\u201dHe put his head forward, leveling his knees down in a calm manner. It was as if he was saying, \u2018pat my head this instant.\u2019Seeing the scene, she was bewildered inside.\u2018\u2026Dog?\u2019For Viola, who lived in South Korea in the twenty-first century, the word \u2018dog\u2019 is very familiar. Still, she isn\u2019t used to that word being attached to humans.\u2018What the hell is he talking about now?\u2019It was as though he knew exactly what it meant when he said that he\u2019s going to be a good dog. The situation is just bizarre.\u201cSo, you\u2019re a dog\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, I said I\u2019d stay with you.\u201dThat was true. Still, what does it have to do with a dog?\u201cThe place next to you is called a pet\u2026\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Being the one next to her is to be a pet. And, he is a dog\u2026 So, that means his dream is to be a pet dog?\u201cBeing your pet dog is my dream.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut, you have not given me permission yet?\u201d\u2018No. Wait a minute\u2026\u2019Is that how things are supposed to go\u2026?Recalling everything, Viola remembered Tundra said he wanted to be a dog to play with her. Moreover, it is true that there is a contract between them.\u2018Though what does it mean that he wants to be a dog?\u2019Viola is bewildered inside but soon raises her arms. As a master, she thought she could do this much.Pat, pat!She patted his head gently. At that, Tundra\u2019s eyes slowly formed like a crescent moon.\u201cThat is today\u2019s compliment.\u201dShe could see the madness forming in his crescent moon eyes.\u2018I don\u2019t think this is right. Isn\u2019t this a bit off\u2026?\u2019Nonetheless, she decided to let it go for now.\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe stared at Tundra with an expressionless face. Not knowing how to react, Viola just continued to look at him silently.\u2018One second. Two seconds\u2026\u2019Remembering what had happened before, it\u2019s dangerous if she gazed at him for more than five seconds.\u2018I\u2019ll avoid looking at him for now.\u2019However, she made sure to make it seem like she was ignoring him, not avoiding him. As soon as Viola was about to shift her gaze away.Clap! Clap!Hickson clapped his hand lightly.\u201cNow, I know, Viola. Your secret.\u201dHickson\u2019s gaze was fixed at Viola.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you want to survive.\u201d\u201cThe Duke has brought me here, so I\u2019ll be sharp and cruel in no time.\u201dIt was a line that I\u2019ve heard a lot.That sharp blade reminds me of the most talented man I\u2019ve ever known, Heron Verratoux.That was what Heron Verratoux said when he first met his adopted daughter, Viola.\u2018This is a dream, right?\u2019Of course, I am dead.I thought for sure this was a dream.I\u2019ve always had regrets reading the novel \u201cThe Shadow of Verratoux.\u201d The heroine, Viola Verratoux, was the ruler of the Duke of Verratoux. Eventually, Viola rose to the top with her natural talent and desperate efforts.But I felt that Viola never felt happiness.Viola may be the succeeding ruler, but in reality, she was lonely and melancholy. I imagined that made me dream of that thought.Let\u2019s pause for a second.This is the prologue of the novel.On the first day, the Winter Castle\u2019s owner, Heron Verratoux, brought in Viola, who was abandoned in an empty private house.There was only one reason why Heron Verratoux brought Viola to Winter Castle.It was because Viola has a \u2018talent as a murderer,\u2019 near the ending of the novel. She murmured.I got cherished by Verratoux, but I lost everything because of Verratouxx as well.As a reader, I always felt sorry for her because of that.I would have done things differently.Since I recognized it from a glance.Usually, whenever the Duke spoke, the seven-year-old Viola, who knew nothing, just listened.As a reader of this novel, I felt pity for her.The first step is always the most important for anything.\u2018Anyway, this is a dream, right?\u2019So I\u2019ve decided to do as I please.\u201cAre you my father now?\u201dWhen I said that, Duke Heron, who was walking in the hallway stopped.The man next to him also flinched.It seemed like he\u2019s Carlton, the Duke\u2019s general butler. A dreamy like father.The Duke of Heron answered in a dry voice.\u201cThat\u2019s what it will be.\u201dThe Duke adopted me because of my great talent as a killer, which he believed could be a good stimulus to Verratoux\u2019s immediate family.To put it simply, I came here as a substitute, who was originally used and abandoned. However, Viola is the main character in the novel, and with her ability, she was able to overcome everything and become his successor. While in the process, facing a tremendous crisis and a great deal of troubles.\u201cHave you ever seen me as your family, even once?\u201d\u201cYou have grown up to be a great Verratoux. Family? Saying things like that doesn\u2019t suit you at all.\u201d\u201cYes, it doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201dBut of course Han Ah-rin, the reader, knew.I wanted to hear that Viola is actually a part of the family. Not the cruel successor Viola Verratoux.I wanted to be the daughter, Viola Verratoux.Though eventually, that wish never came true. Viola ascended to the throne of Verratoux, by killing Heron. Countless readers dropped the novel after this part, and started to curse the writer.Although there are many behind-the-scenes stories, the readers who dropped the novel weren\u2019t able to read the passage.Anyway, I asked my dream father, Heron, a question.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about Verratoux.\u201d\u201cAnd how did you hear about that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rational family.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a reasonable and rational family, why don\u2019t you give me the authority to choose my father? I could only be a part of Verratoux if you allow me to take the lead myself.Carlton tried to restrain me.\u201cWell, Princess?\u201dBe polite. You are now the princess of Verratoux. I\u2019ve become qualitatively different from you in the slums. It seemed like that was what he was going to say.But I knew.Duke Heron would rather hear my provocative question, since that\u2019s his favorite character!\u201cYou seem to know a lot about Verratoux.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI think I know them, better than the Verratoux themselves.\u201cAsk me any questions about Verratoux. I could answer you like a test taker who had memorized the answer sheet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a weak, yet strong family in which everything would be proven by ability.\u201d\u201cAn unsophisticated family that encourages the slaughter of their own family.\u201cThey are the shield of the north, protecting mankind from the \u2018snowy place.\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd a Duke who had iron blood and valued a reasonable choice and farce of the family.\u201dOK.I\u2019m going to smile at this point.Squeak.\u201cYou\u2019re asking me, why didn\u2019t I give you a choice when you\u2019re in such a thorough and reasonable family, right?\u201d\u201cThat sounds about right.\u201dThen the Duke asked me.\u201cWill you be my daughter?\u201d\u201cYes. I will.\u201d\u201cYou answered quickly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause my father is handsome.\u201dThere was a moment of silence.\u201cPlease be precise. It\u2019s not your choice that I was chosen, it\u2019s my choice. My father-to-be was just \u201cproposing\u201d it to me, and \u201cI accepted the offer, okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis sounds like fun.\u201dI could feel Heron Verratoux\u2019s gaze.I could see curiosity hidden in those cold eyes.Anyways, when am I going to wake up from this dream? It\u2019s not a really bad dream.I should be waking up soon.I asked something\u201cI\u2019m your daughter now, so I\u2019m eligible for posterity, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t regret taking me in\u201dI don\u2019t want to be a sacrificial adopted daughter.And not regarded as a tool or stimulant.\u201cI wish you\u2019d love me more.\u201dIt was depressing for me, when I read the novel where Viola eventually became the ruler, but no one no one was on her side.Everyone was afraid of Viola.No one loved her.\u201cYou\u2019ll do that for me, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always thought it would be nice to have a family. You act like a real father, not just in name.\u201dI thought about Viola Verratoux from the prologue.I think I nailed it perfectly.How should I word this?I feel like I\u2019ve become a successful fan..I can\u2019t believe I changed the novel, for her family to become more affectionate to her.This feels like I am more than a fan, it feels like I am in her body.I\u2019m glad this dream lasted for a while.He glanced at the Duke.The butler, Carlton, stood with a strange look on his face.His face was full of small scars, making it seem like he doesn\u2019t fit in a neat suit.The butler\u2019s thought was clearly visible, \u2018that adopted daughter is going to die.\u2019 It was obvious what was on his mind.The Duke of Heron laughed.\u201cAmusing\u201dThe Duke of Heron is known as the \u201cDuke of Heaven.\u201dHe was named that, after killing as many as thousands of people before becoming the head of Verratoux.That was when I felt a terrible energy pouring outUgh!I was astonished that I didn\u2019t realize it.Am I\u2026 inside the novel?My whole body is tingling.The electricity seemed to penetrate my body. My heart trembled, and cold sweats flowed down my back.It was a little strange at this point. Why is this so vivid?\u201cMake sure you survive. I won\u2019t kill you myself.\u201dSomehow it was ominous. Unknown uneasiness began to creep in.\u2026Why won\u2019t I wake up?***She is like a child born with \u201cKiller Star,\u201d which has appeared several times in history books.I bought it on a whim, since I find it quite interesting. It was like finding an intriguing animal, and locking it in a zoo so only he could see. Through the adoption, the child was not even seven-years-old.The thorough and reasonable Heron sat at his desk in his study, lost in his thoughts.\u201cAmusing.\u201dThat was his thought when he first met Viola.She had red eyes. There was a piece of stained glass dripping with blood in her hand. She grabbed the neck of a slave merchant who tried to kidnap her, making him collapse.A seven-years-old child, who wasn\u2019t trained was able to do that. That caused him to wonder why she didn\u2019t give him a choice at that time.The butler, Carlton, uttered.\u201cYou look happy, Duke.\u201d\u201cThat was delightful.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe growth of that child is beyond her years. Besides, isn\u2019t the way she speaks better than Lina, who is older than her?\u201dHer words were not like a seven-years-old child, nor her pronunciation.\u201cI\u2019ve identified myself as seven years old, but in reality, I\u2019m about five years old. I think I was very slow to grow because I couldn\u2019t eat properly. Or she\u2019s just confused about her age.\u201d\u201cDid I look like a kid who\u2019s confused about my age?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cYour mindset, your body language, is different from others.Heron observed the state of Viola, but there wasn\u2019t much to learn.\u201c\u2026You mean it was unnatural?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCarlton also couldn\u2019t think of anything.He pointed out the reason with great common sense.\u201cI may have pretended to be proud, but I am nervous. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to say, then it\u2019s because I felt awkward.\u201dCarlton, who was speaking, realized only then.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dBeing nervous and scared, she had said such things to Heron.It meant that the little girl had a huge heart.\u2018A strong spirit to overcome fear. You\u2019ve taken a good look at that.\u2019By Carlton\u2019s eyes, Viola had a very good first step.The seven-year-old adopted by Verratoux showed the best she could show. A rather rude attitude might have been a problem, but that doesn\u2019t matter because the Duke didn\u2019t mind.But the Duke was thinking of something else.\u2018If he eventually loves me, I should probably be waking up soon.\u201dNo one in Verratoux.Ever ask for affection so proudly.But Viola is different.\u201cI asked you to love me with impudence and dignity.\u201dThe important thing was that it was not done out of servile and confidence. This was my first time experiencing this.And\u2026she is kind.She is different from the other children of the Duke.She didn\u2019t look like seven years old in any way.If feels like if he holds her in his hands, she will break.The Duke asked.\u201cCarlton, what do you think is the probability that this child will survive in Verratoux until she becomes an adult?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s less than 40 percent.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe Duke was lost in his thought. He had an instinctive insight to read a man\u2019s true heart.In the novel, they called it \u2018Genuine Eyes\u201d, which is also read as Real Snow.[T/N: Eyes and snow have the same Korean word.]Viola had a strong affinity for Heron himself. It was also true that he really wanted a family. Viola acted as if she had been a child for a long time. Without feigning ignorance, but from the bottom of his heart, he didn\u2019t understand why.\u2018Why do you like me?\u2019When did you see me? It wasn\u2019t just a simple favor. There was longing and affection in her eyes.Why?There was no telling why.Heron Verratoux, the Winter\u2019s ruler, whose family is nowhere to be found, was very unfamiliar with the unprovocative fondness.Heron commanded.\u201cPut Jenon as her regular butler.\u201d\u201c\u2026Jennon?\u201d\u2018He\u2019s too good to be a butler\u2019, that\u2019s what he thought.He also wanted to make sure what he heard was right.\u201cIs he going to be put as a regular butler, not just temporary?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s word is the law here.\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dTwo days have passed since then.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is this really a dream?Two days passed.In the meantime, no one disturbed Viola.This fluffy, wide white bed contains some magic in it.It was comfortable, but somewhat awkward since it felt like my body would sink just by touching it.I got up and walked towards the desk, and pulled my chair down.Paused.I am relatively small.Though I\u2019m sitting on the chair, my legs can\u2019t even touch the ground.\u2018This is so high.\u2019At this point, I had no choice but to accept that I had \u201cpossessed\u201d Viola.\u2018H\u2026.Have I seriously reincarnated?\u2019This\u2026\u2018and even in the mass killer Princess Viola\u2019s body?\u2019Following her father, a thousand-year-old Duke\u2019s footsteps, she became the adopted daughter of the executioner Duke.Genocide.He\u2019s killed thousands of people.\u2018Impossible.\u2019No.How? I thought this was a dream.How could I believe that this ridiculous phenomenon is real?I ripped out my hair again.\u2018I have seriously possessed this body.\u2019I am now a part of the Iron blood family.The Iron blood Duke.I really had become Verratoux\u2019s adopted daughter.\u2018I became the Main Female Character\u2026\u2019I\u2019ve imagined this a lot but never thought this would actually happen.After two days and ten hours later, Arin had finally accepted.Arin, who lived in the 21st century, became the adopted daughter, Viola Verratoux.I sat at my desk and started to ponder.I need to stay alert if I\u2019m entering the tiger\u2019s den.Phew.I sighed.This is a place where one must thoroughly prove their ability.When Viola became a Verratoux, she started getting hunted by her siblings.She had to prove her abilities, or she would be killed.As a reader, it\u2019s full of tension! It is a thrilling view of the world she lives in.Now that I have entered the character\u2019s shoes, it\u2019s been smeared with dog pop.\u2018First of all, I\u2019m going to have to make those psychos of Verratoux recognize me as Verratoux, right?\u2019Once she survives, she will be recognized.I bit my nails.\u2018Then she would push the first Princess to be the successor.\u2019If Viola did not make all the bad jokes in the original book, the first Princess would have easily taken the post as the next Duchess.When the successor is chosen, the war between the siblings will end.All the dangerous burdens would disappear as well.\u2018All right. Let\u2019s make the first Princess become the Duchess.\u2019In order to follow the original Viola\u2019s footsteps, she had to kill ten thousand people, but I knew I couldn\u2019t do that.I don\u2019t want to kill anyone, nor do I want to die.Viola\u2019s expression became serious.Arin, who is a reader, always felt sorry for Viola.I don\u2019t intend to be a ruler. I don\u2019t want to be the lonely and poor ruler who didn\u2019t even want to become one in the first place.Fortunately, I have read the novel several times and read the synopsis from the author\u2019s blog.\u2018I will live differently.\u2019What\u2019s the point of having no one by my side except myself.I pledged and promised to myself.\u2018Yeah, this is actually the popular novel\u2026\u2019I am in a trap. I might die if I acted differently than the original course of the story. She finally admitted the reality that she possessed the main character.Then I must do my best. I would not be able to live with just a half-hearted mind and effort from the iron-blooded Duke.Arin, who is now Viola, didn\u2019t want to die.\u201cDuring elementary, did you know that Arin wanted to die? Her mother was dead and she doesn\u2019t even have a father as well.\u201d\u201cReally? How did that happen?\u201d\u201cShe lived in a nursery.\u201dHan Arin was an orphan and grew up in a nursery.No matter how loving the teachers were, they couldn\u2019t fill in the void as her parents.\u201cTeacher, when will dad pick me up?\u201dDad said he\u2019d definitely come to pick me up after a hundred nights\u2019 sleep.That was when I was five.But even after a hundred, to two hundred nights, my dad didn\u2019t come back.It was not until middle school that Arin found out.\u2018I\u2019m really abandoned\u2026\u2019Little Arin had no family.Realizing that made me feel miserable. I\u2019ve always thought that I was the only thing that my mom and dad had.The empty despondency I felt made me sick.Arin, who was fifteen at the time, walked up to the school rooftop.She climbed onto the railing. Below that level, I could see the hard ground.I climbed onto the railing. Looking down, I could see the hard ground.Then I quickly realized\u2026 I still want to live.I want to live. It is fine even if I don\u2019t have a family who will truly love me.When I grow up, I want to become a better adult. One that can make the people around me feel loved.I am not going to abandon my family. I will not make another kid feel the same way I did.The fifteen-year-old Arin promised herself.Since then, Arin has always done her best.So she studied harder than ever.She made a lot of friends through high school, and she even got accepted to a prestigious university. The university even gave her a scholarship saying that she \u201cdid well\u201d.The day she got accepted to college, her friends sincerely congratulated her.\u201cYou really are amazing. Congratulations!\u201d\u201cArin, I knew you could do anything!\u201dArin was always used to doing her best.In the second semester of her first year in university, she was busy preparing for the midterm. While studying hard in the library, she dozed off.And when she opened her eyes, she found herself in Viola\u2019s body.Arin, who is now Viola, is determined again.\u2018But\u2026\u2019She has a father here.For the first time in her life, she had a family.This seems better than having no one. That thought occurred to her in an instant.At the same time, she was rather feeling sad.Heron Verratoux was actually a zero-point, or more like a minus hundred-point father as a father.Nevertheless, Arin did not hate him.Being in a cruel succession race was better than being thrown away.At least he\u2019s there for her.\u201cAfter reading the whole novel, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t come to understand Heron Verratoux\u2026\u201dAt first, I thought Heron Verratoux was just a lunatic.But Heron had his own circumstances, and Arin, as a reader, had felt a profound sympathy and understanding for him.That\u2019s why he could have easily been her favorite character.And it wasn\u2019t just him.Some of them are not in their right minds, but they are now her family.They are also longing for affection\u2026 There is still a long way to go with them, but that\u2019s the only way.\u2018All right. This mental breakdown is now over!\u2019I need to adapt to this world.As always, I decided to try my best to survive.I recalled the contents of the novel.\u300c Carlton, what do you think is the probability that this child will survive in Verratoux until she becomes an adult? \u300d\u300c I think it\u2019s less than 10 percent. \u300dThough Viola was not sure, she didn\u2019t think Carlton would actually say that statement.\u201cI think it\u2019s less than 40 percent.\u201dIn the novel, he mentioned 10 percent, but now he said 40 instead.She kept thinking back on the original story.\u300c Appoint Xenon as her temporary butler. \u300d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dI didn\u2019t remember this part either.A temporary butler in a novel.Now that it has become a reality, he has become a regular butler.She didn\u2019t know. The fact that she is passing the role of the adopted daughter in flying colors.Arin closed her eyes and thought.\u2018Xenon, the temporary butler.\u2019Xenon is an elite swordsman from a prestigious family.Due to some incident, twenty first-class regular knights of the Empire were entrusted to Verratoux.\u2018The observer and capable housekeeper, who constantly tests and observes Viola\u2019s qualities.\u2019Xenon doesn\u2019t approve of Viola at first.It wasn\u2019t until the middle part of the novel that Viola was fully recognized, and he became the closest person to Viola.I tried to recall Xenon\u2019s appearance.Purple hair.He had a handsome visage with a good impression.He had a warm smile.He was also keen, and well mannered, always refined.\u300c But he would always observe Viola with mysterious eyes. \u300dThat was the very description of Xenon.Knock, Knock.I heard a knock.A gentle voice resounded from the outside.\u201cPrincess Viola, may I come in? I\u2019m Xenon, the new butler.\u201dViola doubted her ears.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019Something has subtly changed.\u300c Princess Viola, may I come in? I\u2019m Xenon, newly assigned as your temporary butler.\u300dNot \u2018temporary butler,\u2019 but \u2018butler.\u2019Viola stood up.She walked towards the door and opened it.\u2018Why are the doorknobs so high?\u2019Maybe it\u2019s because this is a fantasy world, so it was relatively high.Otherwise, the body of the seven-year-old Viola was much smaller than others of her age.After tiptoeing and raising her arms up in the air, she was finally able to reach the doorknob.When she opened the door, she saw Xenon\u2019s face.\u2018Wow, he\u2019s tall.\u2019He looks the same as the novel\u2019s description, the warm smile, with that purple hair of his.He still has those mysterious-looking eyes.He asked me with a smile while narrowing his eyes.\u201cDid you open the door yourself?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, all you need to do is order me to do so. It must be the butler who opens the door, not the master.\u201dViola smiled softly.Viola is a character born to live in this kind of environment.Viola\u2019s eyes were full of innocence, though Arin might not feel that anymore since she was living her life regarded as someone unimportant in her world.I know the character Xenon well.He wouldn\u2019t let go of the situation easily.Xenon is someone who always tested Viola.\u201cDid you just lecture me?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cI see then.\u201dXenon quickly identified his own mistakes.\u201cI just thought it is rather foolish to see the Princess opening the door herself.\u201dI relaxed a little after hearing that. It seems like I misjudged his attitude.\u201cThe role of a butler is to advise, not discipline. Keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cI will be more careful.\u201dHow to survive as Viola Verratoux.Is to not lose the aura of a Verratoux.I still have the prestige and authority as much as Verratoux to people around me.Even Viola in the original book never lost her prestige and authority.They suppressed people with power and fear, and eventually lost everyone around them.\u201cI\u2019ve heard the butler plays an important role in the Verratoux.\u201dVerratoux\u2019s butlers are incredibly and deeply involved in the succession battle.Butlers who helped the fallen heirs in the succession battle are purged and compete with each other.On the other hand, the butler who establishes his successor wields power over the unknown.\u201cI wanted to check my butler\u2019s face for myself.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I opened the door myself.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that was what you intended. I apologize.\u201dXenon fell on one knee.He then made eye contact with Viola.He smiled.Xenon gave her a charming smile, staring into her eyes.\u201cThis is my face. I\u2019m very happy to be the butler of Miss Viola.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy, too\u201d\u201cEven though I just made a big mistake?\u201dHan Arin has seen this world a lot as a reader.This is how to win the hearts of the characters.I can see how he was able to survive here brilliantly.\u201cThough I understand your intention. It is not proper for the Verratoux\u2019s Princess to open the door herself. That will surely cause me a lot of problems.\u201dAs a true loyal reader of this novel, I understood his point.\u201cI don\u2019t have any issues with your attitude, but rather, it is what you said that bothered me.\u201dXenon started into Viola\u2019s eyes for a while.I was a little shocked.Ah, that\u2019s right\u2026\u2018Those purple pupils\u2026will turn red sometimes, right?\u2019It is said that very few people who were born to be a murder have such a thing.A person who is meant to kill people in their life.But now, I don\u2019t feel that way.Now that I\u2019m here in this story, this is how I\u2019m going to do it.\u2018You\u2019ve become a Verratoux with better qualities than I thought.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m giving you my first order, Xenon.\u201dXenon swallowed a false laugh.Originally, she was going to introduce herself briefly today and explain her stance as a Verratoux and what he should do in front of Princess Viola.I tried to explain them briefly.\u2018Hm\u2026 What should I make him do?\u2019The first day we met. I didn\u2019t know that he would receive an official first order at a short time and it is only 10 minutes after we have met.The situation is rather far beyond his expectations.Since he didn\u2019t hear any explanation, the little Princess also seemed to be doing her part very well.Xenon replied with a smile.\u201cYes. Please give me my first order.\u201dWhen he heard Viola\u2019s first order, he questioned his hearing skills for the first time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s a pretty powerful neurotoxin.\u201dViola only flinched internally.The gaze he had hidden with the smile in Xenon\u2019s eyes was troublesome.She felt as if he was reading everything in her mind.She knew him from the novel, but it was still a little scary.\u201cSir, what\u2019s your role in this family?\u201d\u201cMy role is to help and watch over the Princess.\u201d\u201cThen you should stick to that role.\u201dXenon nodded and bowed his head.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dHe raised his back and smiled. Stick to your role. That was a very Verratoux remark.\u201cPlease expect it to come in twelve minutes.\u201dAnd precisely twelve minutes later, there was a knock.It was not even a second late.The magical clock, which did not allow even 1/10,000 seconds of error, was made by the Master magician of this era, showed that exactly twelve minutes had passed.I got goosebumps.\u201cHere\u2019s a git pen, and a red frog\u2019s poison. I also brought you a note just in case you need it, Princess.\u201d\u201cExcellent.\u201dViola sat at her desk and thought about what would happen tomorrow.There are not many ordinary people in this family.That\u2019s what the world is like.Most of them are twisted and broken characters.The same goes for Vixen, the fifth Prince, who she will meet tomorrow.He would be growing into\u2026 a murder machine that kills innocent people.He has been trained since he was born.He was described as a man that didn\u2019t have any guilt for killing people.There wasn\u2019t even a hint of innocence and kindness in his body.\u2018Tomorrow.\u2019The story will begin tomorrow.Viola bit her lips.\u2018I must survive.\u2019She decided to do her very best.***Viola dressed up in a very extravagant manner.She touched the cloth with her hand. After touching it, she could feel the soft silk that was about to melt.It was a bloody red dress.There was no inconvenience in wearing it because the bottom is not that long.She then waited for Vixen.He is eight years old.His name is Vixen.He is also the most annoying rival of Viola at the beginning of the novel.Phew.I figured it was time for him to come.Knock, KnockI heard a knock on my door.\u201cCome in.\u201dThen, the door opened.The blonde little boy walking around is Vixen, an aspiring murderer, and my one year older brother.\u2018Cute\u2026?\u2019Viola almost laughed because he looked like a little boy in a suit with suspenders.\u2018No, don\u2019t be fooled.\u2019That guy is Vixen. A murderer.I shouldn\u2019t lower my guard.Vixen\u2019s face had no expression.He spoke harshly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but to think you\u2019re my sister.\u201dBut Viola knew.That isn\u2019t the real Vixen.\u300c Vixen thought hard about the introduction to Viola\u2019s room. Let\u2019s show a scary side. For example, Khun, the third prince, had the same look as him. \u300dViola, who has seen it in the same way, gets into a big fight with Vixen.Both get hurt badly. From there, the relationship between the two begins to get tangled.But that was a lie from Vixen.Vixen actually wanted a younger brother. \u2018All his older brothers and sisters have a younger brother, but he\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t have one.\u2019So Vixen has always expected to have a younger brother.Later, Viola was adopted.\u300c Isabella, Vixen\u2019s mother would say .\u300d\u201cVixen, that child is not qualified to be your sibling.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a vulgar thing that she doesn\u2019t have Verratoux\u2019s blood. She\u2019s not your sister, she\u2019s just a lamb.\u201d[Lamb, in this case, are used for/is referred to/as a sacrificial offering]\u201cThen, can we just say hello?\u201d\u201cYou can do it. Make sure that child knows they are not qualified to be your sibling.\u201dViola, who knew the whole story, grinned.The young acolyte, who pretends to be cruel and scary, is actually a promising murderer in a cute way and wanted a younger brother.Crucially, Vixen is very weak at arguing.\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not your sibling?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dWhat did his mother say?That\u2019s right!\u201cYou\u2019re a sacrifice.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dVixen seemed a little embarrassed.\u2018Why aren\u2019t you angry?\u2019Are you a fool?Can I even get angry if you\u2019re ignoring it because you\u2019re stupid?\u2018Then, I\u2019m very disappointed.\u2019I thought it would have been better if he was angry.It\u2019s not like Verratoux to hold back an insult.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you angry?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to be angry?\u201d\u201cI insulted you. You should be angry.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201dVixen blinked and looked at Viola.He forgot his initial purpose that he should look solemn and brutal.He observed Viola with eyes full of murderous intent.\u2018What are you doing?\u2019Hit!At the very same moment, Vixen flinched.What is this?Looking back, a pen was stuck in the wall.I felt a sharp pain from my cheek.\u201cWow.\u201dI touched my cheek.\u201cYou\u2019re good at throwing!\u201dHe said in pure admiration.Vixen was convinced that Viola had thrown an ink pen in a very sophisticated way.Just a little touch.But Viola\u2019s innermost thoughts weren\u2019t thinking that.\u2018Oh, I made a mistake.\u2019I wasn\u2019t really used to it yet because I wasn\u2019t physically used to it.I tried to scare him by throwing it next to him, but I hurt his face instead.\u2018A-are you okay?\u2019The nib of the ink pen was sharp, and Vixen\u2019s cheeks seemed to sting.\u2018If I did something wrong, I would be in big trouble.\u2019My heart pounded.What if he poked me in the eye by accidentally?\u201cHow did you do that so fast?\u201dI couldn\u2019t even see it properly.Fortunately, Vixen didn\u2019t scream or get angry.Instead, he seemed satisfied with Viola\u2019s response.\u201cAre you warning me?\u201dAt that moment, a cold sweat fell on Viola\u2019s back.The look in his eyes showed a flash of rage.It seemed.\u201cYou are an interesting sib-, no, sacrifice!\u201dViola asked back, desperately grabbing her trembling legs.\u201cInteresting?\u201d\u201cYeah. Your warning was really amazing.\u201dA finely calculated trajectory.Faster and sharper than an arrow.Everything was way above Vixen\u2019s expectations.Vixen saw no hesitation in Viola\u2019s eyes.She was born with a murderous nature. It seemed that the word was just right.Though it was not Viola\u2019s intention, he felt a thrill when Viola did that.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re nuts.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d\u201cCan you hug me?\u201dVixen spread his arms.Even though he was spreading his arms, he didn\u2019t realize that Viola is like a cute doll because she\u2019s too tiny! He almost screamed.Viola just stared at Vixen for a while.Vixen said with cold eyes.\u201cDo you not want to?\u201dHugging for Verratoux is not something so simple.The act of hugging an opponent by the Duke of Verratoux is a way of body inspection and weakness.Viola nodded.\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dVixen then embraced Viola.\u201cI like you. Who\u2019s better at killing between us? I\u2019m really curious. Hehe.\u201dHe recognized Viola as his rival.Viola\u2019s heart became heavy.\u201cI\u2019ll admit\u2026 I accept you.\u201dBeing recognized by Vixen meant that she is recognized as a rival in the most brutal succession race.\u201cLet\u2019s do well in the future. Hehe.\u201dHearing those words, Viola stiffened up.However.I heard a voice from behind.\u201cPrince Vixen, how are you? I am the butler, Xenon, assigned to the youngest Princess.\u201dXenon, dressed neatly in a suit, was smiling in the corner.\u201cGood. Why?\u201d\u201cThe Duke has given her ten days.\u201dHe continued, \u201cDon\u2019t touch her for ten days.\u201d\u201cAnd what about it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you would step back.\u201dA mysterious atmosphere formed between the two.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cThen, I have no choice but to file a formal report.\u201d\u201cReport?\u201d\u201cYes, I am also playing the role of her butler, watchman, and reporter.\u201d\u201cWatch? Report? Why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s suspicious. She had calmness at that age.\u201dVixen scratched his head.\u201cDon\u2019t you usually keep that as a secret?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a secret order.\u201dXenon continued with a carefree smile.\u201cAnyway, I have the authority to post reports. Though, of course, I don\u2019t want to post any report.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dVixen let Viola go. His face was filled with smiles.In the meantime, he put a lot of hope into Viola.It was a life filled with curiosity and joy.Viola felt a piercing in her lungs from his intense energy.He was like a promising killer.She then made up her mind once again.\u2018I have to get him on my side.\u2019It was obvious that if she failed, whether it snow or rain, she would still end up with a knife in her.Hehehehe! She smiled. In fact, that was the case in the original story. Such circumstances are not acceptable.Vixen waved his hand.\u201cSee you again sis-\u2026 no. Sacrifice!\u201dWhew.He almost called her his sister.Vixen went outside, controlling his astonished inner thoughts.No.I am passing out. He couldn\u2019t walk further and collapsed.\u201cOhhh, the world is spinning.\u201dHe laid down and murmured.\u201cAm I flying?\u201d[Flying, referring here as something like dying.]The red frog poison seemed to have spread.Viola looked at Vixen, and he is so resistant to poison that this didn\u2019t happen sooner.\u201cThat was a splendid welcome. It\u2019s the perfect victory for the Princess. If the Princess is willing to kill, you would have died today.\u201dXenon went to her side.Viola\u2019s purple hair flattered while she smiled timidly.Though strangely, her shining eyes were hard to read.\u201cIs that why you asked me to get a pen and a frog poison?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut, Princess.\u201dViola put on a haughty look on purpose.But inside, she is terrified.\u2018What would I say if he asked me why I told him to prepare this in advance?\u2019I knew everything before I possessed this very character.So, I should tell him to be ready in advance, or they\u2019d be hunted by a witch.But that was not the kind of question that Xenon asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m pretty decent at my job.\u201dViola squinted her eyes.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re capable enough?\u201dOf course, I know.It was mentioned several times in the novel.There are at least three descriptions that describe \u2018Xenon as a very good butler.\u2019Few people have been portrayed as someone dedicated to their work.\u201cI\u2019ve shown you an ugly side of me, so I have to disagree that I\u2019m competent. Aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cBut it is better than claiming to be incompetent.\u201dViola nodded and said.\u201cYou\u2019ve made two mistakes, so you\u2019ll have to do better.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dXenon bent down.\u201cXenon\u2019s at your service, master.\u201dViola secretly studied Xenon\u2019s face.I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s quick-witted since he was young, and I\u2019ve already read the novels.\u2018You must be itching to ask.\u2019I noticed that he was barely holding back his curiosity.\u201cAsk me questions. But make sure it is worth it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYou look like you\u2019re dying to ask.\u201d\u201cAm I that transparent with my expression?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXenon scratched his cheek gently.He smiled but kept his eyes to mine.\u2018Is it insight or out of tact?\u2019Naturally, Xenon could not have imagined that Viola had read the novel.\u201cI understand you\u2019re quick-witted because you grew up in a poor family, but\u2026\u201dFor now, he concluded that she was quick to adapt and asked.\u201cWhy did you allow Prince Vixen to hug you?\u201dThe original answer was, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your business.\u2019Viola grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201dArin adapted the answer a little differently.She chose a better reply than the original Viola.\u201cHmm, it was a good way to analyze his body shape. It\u2019s also easy to identify weak areas. When one holds a sword, you can measure the length of their arms, the body\u2019s mobility, and where the musculature has developed by touching the muscles. So, that\u2019s why I allowed him to hug me.\u201dXenon lost his words for a moment.He was told that she\u2019s just a seven years old girl from the slums without any education.If she wasn\u2019t taught, it must be out of natural instinct.Xenon replied, concealing his embarrassment.\u201cThat\u2019s why you allowed Prince Vixen to hug you?\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a problem?\u201d\u201cThe problem is\u2026not that.\u201dXenon felt as if he had been hit on the head.\u2018She\u2019s great.\u2019He admired her frankly.It might be an answer that anyone can say, but it couldn\u2019t be the answer from the girl who had only arrived at the Verratoux family three days ago.Xenon approached Viola and knelt on one knee.\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say because you are absolutely right. To be honest, I didn\u2019t expect you to pay attention to that extent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. You have great confidence, Princess.\u201d Xenon said while taking someone out of his front pocket.It was a small knife.Viola is a little surprised. But she didn\u2019t let it show on her face.Xenon tended to the protruding stitches near Viola\u2019s sleeve.It was a very gentle and delicate touch.\u2018He wasn\u2019t like this in the original?\u2019 Xenon is a little more affectionate than the original story.\u201cI will report to the Duke.\u201d\u201cGo, do your job.\u201d\u201cBut I will also let the Princess know about it as well.\u201dXenon took a piece of paper out from his arms.It looked like a report.This was also not mentioned in the original book.[ It is apparent that the necessary skills needed to be the absolute ruler of Winter Castle are there.There is also an instinctive desire and ambition for the absolute.She has a necessary madness for Verratoux.We also have the ability to control the madness. ]Indeed, she did better than she thought. However, the content of the report is a little strange. An instinctive desire for domination?Ambition?\u201cWhy are you showing this to me?\u201dShe added, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to show this to me.\u201d\u201cI have seen enough of your qualities and talents. As you intended, you fully proved your qualifications during your meeting with Prince Vixen.\u201d\u201cSo I will do my best to make you become the next Duke.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou wanted to stay as a princess, don\u2019t you?\u201dNo.I don\u2019t intend to be a Princess forever.First of all, my goal is to survive.My plan is to give the successor title to the first Princess.And I want to live as the human Viola, not a murder machine or a princess who is ten-thousand years old.\u2018Please!\u2019There is an indescribable earnestness in his eyes.\u201cI can read it. The desperation in your eyes.\u201dIt\u2019s not out of desperation!\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen those eyes you have.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try, Princess.\u201dThis gave me a terrible headache. But I decided to do what I need to for now.\u201c\u2026Get a family tree. The more detailed, the better.\u201dA stormy day has passed.The meeting with Vixen was hectic. Though the conversation with Xenon seemed to have gone well, still she is afraid.Phew.Arin made up her mind after deep thinking?\u2018I need to survive.\u2019You have to prove your ability.You should not be a shameful Princess in Verratoux.The moment when you show an unbecoming image, you will be removed without a single rat or bird noticing.Phew.I don\u2019t know how many times I sighed today.I decided what I have to do now.\u2018I guess Vixen is getting whipped by now.\u2019It was mentioned in the novel.\u300c \u201cVixen, how did you see her?\u201d \u300d\u201cIt was fun.\u201dDuchess Isabella lifted the whip.The whip was made from a thin Isilla wood. Ironically, Isilla means to be \u2018love\u2019 in the southern language.[T/N: Context came to the word Ai, which means love in Nihongo or Japanese]Just like a horse getting whipped.\u201cShe\u2019s your enemy. How can you be so lenient towards your enemies?\u201d\u201cLenient?\u201d\u201cYou have to trample them.\u201d\u201cI understand, but why?\u201d\u201cBecause it is wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d\u201cYou have to be scolded.\u201d\u201cYou know it well. You\u2019re going to get the cane, right, my son?\u201d\u300c Vixen knelt silently and prepared to be whipped. \u300dHe silently endures the punishment from his mother, Duchess Isabella.\u300c \u201cWhy are you crying? Does a Verratoux show tears?\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cMother\u2019s hands are bleeding.\u201d \u300dThe bark of an Isilla tree causes chemical reactions when it touches human skin.In some cases, severe burns would stay on Duchess Isabella\u2019s skin.Duchess Isabella is always burned when she whips.Vixen didn\u2019t feel hurt due to him being hit.However, it is painful to see his mother\u2019s hand.\u300c \u201cDon\u2019t be weak.\u201d \u300dIf he were a normal child, he wouldn\u2019t have been punished, but he took the punishment silently every time.He will then return to his daily routine in a day or two with superhuman resilience. That was stated in the novel.I have to get Vixen by my side, she thought.Vixen is not the only one.If she can, she should get everyone on her side.The blue moonlight slipped past the window.I clapped my hands.\u201cXenon.\u201dThen, after a while, the door opened, and her butler had come in.\u201cI have a place I need to go. Guide me.\u201d\u201cAt this hour?\u201dXenon was the same as usual. The sudden call at 1 a.m.. was not a disturbance for him at all.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\u201cVixen\u2019s Room.\u201dXenon\u2019s eyes turned to Viola.\u201cPrince Vixen must be having a hard time right now.\u201dIt\u2019s not because the cane hurts, but rather the fact he got scolded by his mother for doing something wrong.His mom\u2019s hands were rough because of him, and it\u2019s all his fault. He would think he is a bad kid and blames himself.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cYou know?\u201dXenon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen family relationships.\u201dBefore Xenon further doubts, Viola continued.\u201cIf I were the third female lion in this family, I would also scold my son for visiting an enemy first, especially since I\u2019m not pure blood. Duchess Isabella is from the family Qualton Family, so her hand must hurt a lot. Vixen would be down and groaning as well from the terrible discipline.\u201d\u201cAha. So you\u2019re planning to stab Prince Vixen?\u201dXenon slipped out a dagger.There was a purple liquid on the blade. It was just plain poison.\u201cYou think I would do that? I\u2019ve already learned about the absolute law.\u201dHowever, in Winter Castle, violence or murder is not allowed. Except for the preceding Duke.All children under the age of ten till two are protected.\u201cIf I kill Vixen, who\u2019s wounded now, you will be executed for failing to guide me.\u201d\u201cThat could be a problem.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want my butler dead either.\u201dEven Arin, who became Viola, needed Xenon.\u201cWhy?\u201dI didn\u2019t think he would be asking me, \u2018Why?\u2019Viola is a little embarrassed.\u201cYou are necessary for Viola Verratoux.\u201dBecause I need you, I didn\u2019t know how else I could say it. I said it with my full name as if I\u2019m talking about someone else. It was a habit as a reader.Xenon went silent for a moment. He was necessary for Viola.Xenon had goosebumps for a moment. That word holds a lot of implications.\u2018You don\u2019t have to point out for Verratoux.\u2019The little girl seemed to have a good grasp of her role and position here.\u2018I didn\u2019t notice.\u2019She wasn\u2019t just a quick-witted slum girl.Though, he couldn\u2019t explain it by just looking at her.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019It was an amazing insight.Xenon smiled meaningfully.\u201cI feel encouraged to hear that I\u2019m needed for the Verratoux.\u201dHe bent down.\u201cPlease continue to use me as your butler.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dArin couldn\u2019t relax. Xenon is a faithful butler for Viola, but he did not serve Viola from the beginning to the second half.Viola constantly tests and determines whether he is the right person to serve her.This line also existed in the original story.\u300c \u201cIf she didn\u2019t fit in with Verratoux, I would probably have killed myself and commemorated her neck as a keepsake. \u300dIn the second half of the novel, Xenon, who became very close to Viola, said it jokingly.But Han Arin, who was a reader knows, more than half of the words he said were sincere.So, I decided to be careful. It doesn\u2019t hurt to be a bit cautious, anyway.\u201cThis way.\u201dI walked along the long hallway while climbing some stairs as well. The mansion is massive, so it took quite a long time to walk around.\u201cThis is the fifth Prince, Vixen\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201dI took a deep breath.If I open this door, I will be able to see Vixen in a poor state.\u201cOpen the door.\u201d\u201cWithout knocking?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d1 a.m.It was tranquil.Not a sound was heard.Creak\u2014Quietly, they opened the door.When Xenon opened the door, she felt a strange and heterogeneous atmosphere and a smell.The bitter smell that I thought would only be experienced inside the novel was in my head, but now the ominous scent that was straight from the book had stung my nose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone suddenly appeared.It was the butler of Vixen.\u201cPrince Vixen doesn\u2019t want to meet anyone.\u201d\u201cPrince Vixen says he wanted to meet her.\u201d\u201cPrince Vixen says no.\u201d\u201cThe Princess says yes.\u201dVixen\u2019s butler frowned.\u201cXenon, I\u2019m warning you. Shut up.\u201dTheir eyes met in the air.Viola felt a spark flying between those two.Xenon looked at her.\u201cThat\u2019s what they say. What should we do?\u201d\u201cCan you do anything about it?\u201dXenon looked at Viola and back at Vixen\u2019s butler as he was trying to change his mind.Vixen\u2019s butler seemed absurd.We\u2019re discussing whether or not we can subdue him in front of other parties.But he wasn\u2019t altruistic enough because she is a Verratoux.Xenon shrugged his shoulders and said.\u201cWell, as you know, all the people in this family are strong.\u201d\u201cCan you do it or not?\u201d\u201cIt sounds difficult.\u201dXenon took a dagger out from his arms and smiled warmly.\u201cYes, but I\u2019m not sure if I can.\u201d\u201cXenon, don\u2019t be silly.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t we close enough to talk to each other?\u201dXenon thrust a dagger into the butler\u2019s neck.\u201cAre you going to ignore the laws of Winter Castle?\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t stabbed him yet.\u201dThe moment it rained, he felt an eerie aura.He hasn\u2019t stabbed him yet, but what about the aftermath.\u2018If it weren\u2019t for me, you\u2019d have been stabbed.\u2019The words seemed to be omitted.Viola almost shivered.Behind that warm expression and gentle smile, I can\u2019t believe I would feel scared.\u2018Don\u2019t let them see that you\u2019re afraid.\u2019She trudged away to hide her fear and walked fast.I wanted to stay away from living. Viola\u2019s \u2018body\u2019 feels alive, but Arin\u2019s \u2018spirit\u2019 can\u2019t handle it that much and was scared to handle this kind of situation.Vixen\u2019s room was quite large, so she had to walk for quite a while.After Viola disappeared into the room, Xenon took a dagger.\u201cDid you see that?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dVixen\u2019s butler sighed.\u201cShe didn\u2019t miss the opportunity for the gap and the timing after I pushed against you.\u201d\u201cYes, there\u2019s no delay at all.\u201d\u201cFast decision, action, and timeliness. It\u2019s the basic virtue of Verratoux.\u201dVixen\u2019s butler gave all the rundown.\u201cIf I had really stopped you, would you have stabbed me?\u201d\u201cI suppose so, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying it so easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than lying.\u201dXenon grinned and followed Viola inside.\u201cYou have a good subordinate. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAre you really going to serve me?\u201d\u201cYes, for now. I think you have a lot of ambition and control.\u201d\u201cReally? It\u2019s not really out of the effort. I am born to be a ruler. Who would have thought? Ten minutes after we met, my first order was for you to find a neurotoxin that would poison my brother.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been very reasonable about me. She acted like she was born and raised in Verratoux.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s possible if you have a great insight and a clear appreciation of the reality and role you\u2019re playing, based on your natural talent.\u201dIf Viola heard it, she would have been in a hurry, and she would have breathed in really big.***\u2018Phew, it\u2019s a long way from here. Vixen\u2019s room is massive. It was likely to be two-hundred times.\u2019I couldn\u2019t figure out which living room this was.Creak.I opened the door.He was right in front of me. Under the big window where the blue moon shines in. I could see Vixen, who was seriously injured, lying down.\u2018Uh.\u2019I am scared. How should I express this feeling? I felt like I was facing a fierce beast on the verge of attacking. I felt fear for a moment.Here, it\u2019s a routine. It is not just a smell of blood, but a world where severed necks can be turned around. I had to get used to it.Step, step.I moved, trying to get closer to the boy.\u2018That\u2019s a terrible sight,\u2019 Vixen is squatting under the window.Viola crossed her legs in the chair in front of the table past Vixen. She then looked down at Vixen and said.\u201cDid you get hit a lot?\u201dI licked my lips.I just did it because I thought Viola would lick her lips at times like this.\u201cI bled a lot. Though it was only a little today.\u201dI touched his chin while he was sobbing. I looked at Vixen\u2019s body in a dignified manner.\u201cIsilla\u2019s whip?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dVixen\u2019s eyes blushed. He was thinking, \u2018rather than a red wound on my body, the burn on my mother is scarier and more painful?.\u2019\u201cYou must have been hurt.\u201d\u201cYes. My mother must have been very hurt.\u201d\u201cIt was your mother\u2019s choice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d\u201cReally? Did you do something wrong?\u201d\u201cYes. I was a bad Vixen.\u201dThe sight of Vixen, answering instantly suddenly broke my heart. Of course, the family I wanted was not like this. I bit my lips slightly.Viola approached Vixen.\u201cTurn your back and sit.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you going to stab me?\u201dVixen tilted his head and talked back.\u201cWe\u2019re in the Winter Castle. You\u2019ll be in trouble if you stab me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t stab you.\u201dWith those words, she spoke in the most Viola-like way.\u201cOne day, I\u2019ll make you kneel under my feet.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThe day will come when you crawl on the floor, open your stomach, and hide your tail like a dog.\u201dVixen\u2019s eyes started to look lively.Viola wanted to cry.I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting excited by this kind of nonsense.\u201cBut I will lose this humble brother.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no fun to trample on a humble brother.\u201dVixen laughed as if he was having fun.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Hehe.\u201dThen, he turned his back.\u201cLike this, can you turn your back to me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola put ointment on her hands.\u2018Oh, no matter how crazy the Duchess is in this fantasy world. This is just too much.\u2019Can we even call this general discipline?If Vixen had an allergic reaction to the Isilla tree, then why would Isabella use that whip?Prick.Vixen\u2019s ears perked up.He is like a rabbit.He was wondering what Viola was taking out.Vixen asked in a bright voice.\u201cAre you taking out a knife?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen? Poison?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201dVixen became even more lively.\u201cDo you have hydrochloric acid?\u201dPhew.What on earth is going on in this guy\u2019s head.\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u2018Oh, well, that\u2019s just too much.\u2019No matter when, he only has a sting, hydrochloric acid, and poison in his head.But he is still an eight-year-old child.\u2018He\u2019s so young.\u2019Arin, twenty-one, also had a small back.This is too much.How can a mother do this to her son?How can an adult do this?An eight-year-old child\u2019s back is not supposed to look like this.I carefully applied the medicine to the back of the child who had never gotten it applied before.\u201cI-it stings!\u201dHe was so embarrassed that he spoke strangely.\u201cDon\u2019t complain.\u201d\u201cWhat poison is this? I\u2019ve never felt this way before.\u201cNot poison, but an ointment.\u201dVixen couldn\u2019t understand what Viola said for a while.It didn\u2019t cross his mind that ointment is a medication for treatment.Probably because he has never put on ointment. Since no one has ever applied it on him.Viola felt a little more heartbroken.\u201cI think you thought of ointment as a very special poison.\u201dIt was very frustrating, absurd, and heartbreaking for her.\u201cI told you. I don\u2019t want to kneel on my humble sibling.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get sick. I hope you get better soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201dViola said things she didn\u2019t mean.\u201cThat\u2019ll make it more fun to kill.\u201dVixen then tilted his head.\u201cHmm. That\u2019s weird.\u201dAt the moment, Viola is a little surprised.I was nervous because my acting was too awkward, but it didn\u2019t look like it.Vixen poked himself in the chest with his finger. It was near the heart.\u201cBut Viola.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI felt a little fuzzy here. It feels strange.\u201dWeird\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t get sick. I hope you get better soon.\u201dHe felt really strange when he heard that.He didn\u2019t feel bad, but he felt like crying for some reason. It felt like he had never felt this kind of feeling in his life before.\u201cWhy am I smiling and crying?\u201dHe put on a serious face.\u201cDid you poison me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you feed me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut why are your eyes red? Did you poison yourself?\u201dViola is not a psychopathic killer like the real Viola from the novel.She had dreamed of a family more than anyone else, and she wanted to be in a warm family.The scar on the back of an eight-year-old child turned a little red.On the surface, he said.\u201cIf I were going to poison you, I wouldn\u2019t have given you such a lame poison.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. Hehe.\u201d\u201cAnd I almost got disappointed.\u201d\u201cWhy, why?\u201d\u201cPrince of Verratoux showed his tears.\u201d\u201cI cry when I\u2019m sad.\u201dViola knows everything. The reason why Vixen cried.Your mother\u2019s pain is more painful than your pain.From now on, I decided to twist the original story. It was because of the strange discipline of Duchess Isabelle that made Vixen become a twisted murderer.\u201cIf Duchess Isabella hadn\u2019t hit you, nothing would have happened to you.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s my fault.\u201dViola grinned.\u201cOppa, can I tell you why you\u2019re so sad?\u201d\u201cIs there a reason why I\u2019m really sad?\u201dThere is.The reason why I don\u2019t know much about young Vixen at this point.No, I do know, but there is a reason why little Vixen is unconsciously rejecting her.\u201cYou were physically persecuted in the Winter Castle. The law has never been broken.\u201d\u201cBut mother is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m sure you know.\u201dAfter a while in the story, Vixen killed Duchess Isabella himself.\u300c \u201cWhy did you do this to me?\u201d \u300d\u300c \u201cI have to kill my mother. For the sake of the law.\u201d \u300dVixen did not want to kill Duchess Isabella. He loved his mother, but because of the rules and the Duke\u2019s laws, in the distant future, Vixen had to kill Duchess Isabella with his own hands in the distant future.The day she was killed by Vixen, the Duchess replied with a smile.\u300c \u201cYou have to kill your mother to become a true monarch.\u201d \u300dDuchess Isabella is dreaming of dying in her son\u2019s hand one day.In the hope that her son will grow stronger, only when he can kill his mother can he have a stronger mind. That was Duchess Isabella\u2019s discipline\u2019s direction.\u300c \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up well, my baby.\u201d The Duchess smiled happily and died. \u300dAfter the incident, Vixen was reborn as a true killing machine.Viola shuddered at the thought of the story.Oh, come to think of it again, this is a novel with characters that are not in the right mind.\u201cAs time goes by, I have to kill my mother, who made me so twisted, with my own hands\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the law of Winter Castle.\u201dTime has passed for a little while.Vixen turned and made eye contact with Viola.\u201cBut you know what, Viola?\u201dComing out from Vixen\u2019s mouth were words that Viola had not expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sequence of the chapters had changed.\u300c \u201cMy mom gave me a mission.\u201d \u300dThe original Vixen and Viola will be on duty together. It was Viola\u2019s first official mission. In the original book, Vixen said.\u300c \u201cIt would be fun if you and I compete, right?\u201d \u300dBut right now, Vixen said something a little different.\u201cDo you want to play with me?\u201dIt was subtly different from the original story. Now it\u2019s not about competition, but playing instead.\u201cPlay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really fun. It\u2019ll be filled with a lot of fun.\u201d\u201cWith who?\u201d\u201cViola!\u201dViola almost collapsed as her legs relaxed.He\u2019s smiling brightly, calling her name with his own mouth.Though she can\u2019t believe he\u2019s innocent and not vicious.\u2018I\u2019m doomed.\u2019Don\u2019t be too mushy with Vixen.He\u2019s been trained to kill since he was born.If he decided to do so, he would be thirsty and kill a lot of adults. He is a very, very dangerous biological weapon.Viola was determined.Don\u2019t be fooled by his appearance. She only felt sorry for the abused Vixen and his safety for just once.\u201cWell, that does sound like fun.\u201dThe sequence of episodes has changed. However, Viola thought it was a good thing.Nonetheless, this chapter is an important point for Viola.\u2018I\u2019m about to kidnap the main male character.\u2019She thought she would meet the Main Male Lead, \u2018Tundra\u2019 from the novel.***Xenon gave me some explanations.\u201cIt\u2019s your first time in action, isn\u2019t it? Most bandits use weak poisoned bows and hypnotism. In close combat, they often swing their axes, but they tend to get tired quickly because they only swing with force without proper skill.\u201d\u201cAnd this is a highly poisoned dagger, please be careful using it. If you\u2019re stabbed by mistake, then you\u2019re going there, Princess.\u201dHe pointed his finger at the sky.She laughed. She thought he meant going to the sky as if Xenon was talking about some cute story.Don\u2019t speak like that with such a warm smile.Viola responded after swallowing her words after a while.\u201cI don\u2019t need extreme poison.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be useful.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to play with poison.\u201dIn fact, she refused because she is afraid of being poisoned by mistake, but Xenon was easily convinced.\u201cHmm. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201dXenon wiped the poison with a handkerchief and smiled, handing Viola the dagger.\u201cI hope you succeed with your mission.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m with you, but I can\u2019t give you direct help. This is Princess\u2019s assignment, after all.\u201dYes, this is the mission that Vixen was talking about a while back.So, \u2018playing\u2019 is a mission to suppress the raging bandits in the Beto Mountains.It wasn\u2019t a big bandit group. However, eight-year-olds can\u2019t punish a massive group of bandits all alone, though.In the first place, it was more like exercise for Vixen than a mission.Xenon asked.\u201cWould you like to get on a carriage? Or should I prepare a horse for you?\u201dViola can\u2019t ride a horse.Viola looked up at Xenon.\u201cI want you to serve me more elegantly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll prepare a carriage then.\u201dXenon prepared a carriage.It was a carriage led by a pair of black horses. Thanks to magic, the carriage is surprisingly comfortable.However, Vixen seemed a little dissatisfied.\u201cI enjoy riding horses.\u201d\u201cThen you can ride a horse.\u201d\u201cWhy did you call me just now?\u201dVixen raised his chin in front of Viola. He pointed his finger at Viola.\u201cYou are seven years old.\u201dThen he stabbed himself in the chest with his fingers.\u201cI am eight years old.\u201dHis expression was full of arrogance. The carriage\u2019s room was filled with arrogance.\u201cYou should call me brother.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m eight years old, and you\u2019re seven years old?\u201dAs innocent as he is, Viola almost laughed without realizing it.She held back her smile, desperately.\u201cBut I would have killed ten more people than you. Hehe.\u201dHis smile was then wiped off.\u201cIf you hate carriages so much, you can go ride the horses.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHorses would feel burned out.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThen they won\u2019t look cool.\u201dIt was a profound resolve of an eight-year-old to save even his stamina.Viola and her party headed to the Beto Mountains, south of the Winter Castle.The Beto Mountains are small mountain ranges that are separated from the giant \u2018Northern Great Mountains.\u2019Viola pulled herself together.\u2018Practice against bandits might not be difficult for the real Viola. However, for me, I was just Arin who became Viola.\u2019So, Viola rattled her brain.\u201cOppa.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance first.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a game for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dVixen nodded his head. He asked her to play with him, but he didn\u2019t want to lose to his sister.He also wanted to show his very best self in front of his younger sibling.As an older brother.\u201cYou take care of them first.\u201d\u201cOkay, I see.\u201d\u201cDo as much as you can. Don\u2019t overdo it though.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re having a hard time, I\u2019ll help you then.\u201dShe made a deliberately derisive expression.It hit Vixen\u2019s pride.\u201cHa! That\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201dVixen made a promise to himself.He\u2019ll show her his strong side as her older brother.\u201cYou just stay put. I\u2019ll do everything for you!\u201d***A twelve-year-old boy.Tundra had a treasure.It was his father and sister.For him, his father and sister are his treasures.His father was always friendly.\u2018Straighten your back, look straight ahead. That\u2019s right! You\u2019re doing great! My son, you\u2019ll be a great hunter!\u2019His sister, who had been weak since she was young, always supported Tundra.\u201cSister, I\u2019ll be a great hunter. I\u2019ll fix your body and make sure our family lives happily ever after.\u201d\u2018You don\u2019t have to be famous. I just want you and dad to be happy.In his childhood days, Tundra\u2019s mother ran away from poverty.The three remaining family members relied on each other to overcome poverty.Tundra\u2019s ability to hunt at the age of six is getting better and better now.He isn\u2019t as hungry as before.\u2018You\u2019re getting better at catching now. My son, that\u2019s great.\u2019Tundra smiled brightly.\u201cDaddy hunts, and I hunt, so we hunt twice as many.\u201dThings were going well.\u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about my sister\u2019s medicine anymore.\u201dIf things keep going this way\u2026 If I become a better hunter.\u201cShe could be treated at the temple.\u201dThat\u2019s what Tundra has dreamed. He firmly believed that his dream would one day become a reality.Seven days ago.Tundra\u2019s dream collapsed.\u201cI got a deer! He\u2019s a big guy!\u201dThough there was no sign of people in the house, things felt strange and ominous.\u201cDaddy\u2026!\u201dHis father was dead. He was so badly murdered that he couldn\u2019t bear to open his eyes.In the meantime, he did not let go of the hatchet in his right hand.He seemed to have had a fierce fight with something or someone.\u201cSister!\u201dOur father is dead.He couldn\u2019t find his sister.Tears streamed down his eyes.It felt like the world had collapsed.It looked like his sister had been kidnapped.He could see axe marks in different places.Footprints were also seen.The number of footprints wasn\u2019t one or two. It seemed to be at least four or five.He bit his lips tight.\u2018Daddy, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m terribly sorry. I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019I had to bury my dad, but I couldn\u2019t do it now.\u2018I\u2019ll find her first. I\u2019ve been frantically searching for her.\u2019 For three days, he didn\u2019t even eat, and he just followed the trails.He then entered Beto Mountains.In the end, he found a wild vegetable.As far away as that.He could see a wooden book and a small watchtower.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe could see a mound of dirt. There was blood everywhere.\u2018No, it\u2019s not.\u2019It was so ominous.He didn\u2019t want to think so.Tundra dug up the dirt with trembling hands. When he dug up a little, he saw a pale hand.It was a human hand, a girl\u2019s hand.\u2018This isn\u2019t happening.\u2019He dug madly into the soil.There was the body of a young girl whose fingernails had peeled off and blood flowing from them.Even at a terrible sight, Tundra was relieved.\u2018It\u2019s not my sister\u2026\u2019I need to hurry.He infiltrated into the living quarters to find his sister.It was then when he heard the voice of Xenon from outside the carriage.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived. There\u2019s a mountain in front of us.\u201dVixen opened the carriage door wide to see what it was so urgently.Viola controlled her thoughts. There will be a terrible massacre spree in a little.\u2018They deserve to die.\u2019She has seen it all in the novel.They killed so many people.Among them were the father and sister of Male Lead, Tundra.The carriage stopped.It was a narrow road that was difficult to get through by carriage.Vixen lifted his poisoned dagger.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that slope?\u201d\u201cIt looks like it hasn\u2019t been long since it was built.\u201dThe carriage has set up a hillside nearby. This means that it is not an outstanding production.Vixen walked forward.\u201cThere\u2019s no one on the watchtower.\u201dNo matter how crude a mountain is, some people are bound to watch the watchtower.Vixen grinned.\u201cIt smells like blood, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dShe found something while walking.\u201cIt\u2019s a dead body.\u201dVixen looked down at the body with a bored look.He understood the situation as soon as he saw it.\u201cThere was a body buried here, and someone scraped the ground out.\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dViola was nauseated. The body was laid before she was a little girl.She was small and didn\u2019t look older than ten.Viola bit her lips.Why?I don\u2019t know if that little kid should be dead like that, even in the fantasy world.\u2018Why\u2026!\u2019She knew from her head.She knew all of it, but she still felt like crying.Reading it from the novel is very different than seeing it with your own naked eyes.She arrived in front of the mountain house.Vixen knocked confidently.Knock, knock.After knocking, she shouted more proudly.\u201cWe\u2019re coming in!\u201dThere should be no one inside the watchtower.Viola knew that fact, and she proceeded to push the wooden door.Creak-The door opened with a sound. Vixen scanned his eyes round.\u201cThe door was open.\u201dViola pointed her finger under the ground.\u201cThere\u2019s a sign that it just opened. Get inside.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe door for a mountain house is usually pulled from the outside since it\u2019s more uncomfortable than pushing it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat way, they can get a little time when they run away.\u201dBut there were traces of pushing and opening.Originally, there should have been traces in the opposite direction.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the graves, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cSomeone broke in before us.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that there are no people on the lookout no matter how poor the bandits are.\u201d\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201dIt doesn\u2019t make sense.A single man should still be on the lookout.\u201cThere\u2019s a story that someone who knows how to handle this bow shot killed a man on a watchtower and sneaked into that very door.\u201d\u201cThen, brother. It\u2019s explainable that you smelled blood. They were already defeated.\u201dVixen\u2019s eyes have narrowed.\u201cI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m going to lose my plaything.\u201dVixen began to run.\u201cYou\u2019re faster than me. That\u2019s pretty good.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can explain the scent of blood as there was probably a battle.\u201dI whispered to Xenon just in case. \u201cDid you want me to explain that?\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to.\u201dIn fact, the butler understood most of the situation since the moment there were no people in the watchtower. Though, what the butler found out was different from what the seven-year-old princess did.\u201cDid the Duke give her special training in secret?\u201d\u201cNo, he came across her and brought her in.\u201d\u201cBut how can she\u2026\u201d Ferron was not convinced.No matter how much genius she was, he couldn\u2019t understand the insight she had.\u201cWell, I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand, just accept it.\u201d\u201cDo you understand?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t understand, I should just accept it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201dFerron frowned.\u201cI\u2019m going to accompany Prince Vixen first then.\u201d Then, Ferron disappeared.He went to Vixen, who ran first, secretly.Xenon walked behind Viola, who was walking slowly.\u201cAre you going to follow the prince?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cI found a tiny footprint leading here.

I\u2019m sure he has a grudge. He\u2019s a child with no sense of remorse, so he didn\u2019t care.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? Am I wrong in my analysis?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s exactly the same as what I analyzed.\u201d Viola kept walking.A scream came from far away.A violent scream.Vixen seemed to be punishing the bandits.Viola\u2019s body stiffened. \u2018In this world, I have to get used to it.\u2019She walked past the yard. Everywhere, there were old wooden buildings in the form of huts.\u201cA child who doesn\u2019t know what to do. He was blinded by vengeance and chased after them to this place.\u201dShe continued. \u201cMaybe they were shot or axed before he got his revenge. That\u2019s why there was no disturbance inside.\u201dXenon listened to Viola in silence. He guessed that Viola wasn\u2019t just talking about this.\u2018You\u2019re telling me to listen.\u2019Viola Verratoux was aware of her position and role accurately.So, now she\u2019s giving him her insight into everything, and she\u2019s telling him that on purpose.It was a self-appeal, so to speak.It was surprising for Xenon.He couldn\u2019t hide his amazement, \u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, wouldn\u2019t he be hiding somewhere over here?\u201d\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s where he\u2019s hiding?\u201dCreak.They opened the door.She could see a boy in the corner.His hair was in a disheveled form, and his leather clothes were covered with soil and sweat. There was also blood all over the place.As soon as it rained, she felt like she had been hit on the head.What is this?There was no such thing in the novel.\u2018Why are you-\u2018He looked so much like someone she knew very well.***There was always a word of consolation to Arin, who was abandoned in the nursery.\u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019It was Kang Han-joon, her five-year-older brother.\u2018It\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll help you.\u2019His words magically eased Arin.Our parents will be back soon.She didn\u2019t give such consolation in return.He just told her that he would help her. He said he\u2019d be there for him, and he had actually always been there for her.When she went up to the top of the school, the first person she thought of was Kang Han-joon.Time passed. Arin turned nineteen years old.Her mind became complicated.\u2018Does that mean I like him?\u2019It felt so strange.Does she like him as a man, or does he feel like a reliable guardian to her?\u2018Let\u2019s not get confused. My brother is just my guardian.\u2019We\u2019ve been together for a long time.And since we spent a long time together, we made a lot of memories together.So, I thought it was a good thing.Then, one day, Kang Han-joon introduced his girlfriend to her.She was a pretty sister.That day Arin was filled with jealousy.She liked Kang Han-joon before she knew it. She admitted it herself but she hid it in her heart.It was obvious that she would be rejected if she told him now.Kang Han-joon\u2019s warm eyes always showed love, but his love was not out of rationale.Time flew faster than I thought.\u2018I\u2019m an adult now.\u2019I decided to be honest with my feelings.\u2018I\u2019ll just confess and get dumped.\u2019Though it was scary to confess.\u2026Let\u2019s think about it for one more day.A day later, she wore black on that day.The subject to consider confessing has gone too far.Kang Hanjoon, who was always there for her, became a star in the sky and suddenly disappeared.He got into a car accident.It was the day he had an appointment with Arin.She cried for a long time in the corner of the funeral hall, dressed in black.\u201cYou said you\u2019d buy me something delicious. You said you got paid so why aren\u2019t you buying me one?No matter how hard I tried to call out to him, my brother didn\u2019t come back.But\u2026 now he\u2019s here.A twelve-year-old boy was seen with a beastly harsh breath.His body was in a complete mess, but the light in his eyes was still there.Tundra saw a girl who suddenly appeared.She was very small, she seemed to be around five or six years old.\u201cWho\u2026?Viola came close to Tundra like she was possessed by something.He was the same as Kang Han-joon.His face was so similar to the person she had known.\u201cS-stay away from me.\u201d Tundra took a small knife out from his arms.It was an old, shabby knife.His hand that was holding a knife trembled.Viola looked at Tundra\u2019s face.\u2018They are very much the same.\u2019Viola stood right in front of him.\u201cI-I\u2019ll stab you if you come closer!\u201dViola didn\u2019t care about his words. She squatted and lifted Tundra\u2019s leg.Calf.She checked his calves.There were three dots on the left calf. It was triangular.\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019Why are they the same?Viola squatted down and looked straight into Tundra\u2019s eyes.Their eyes were the same, but his eyes felt different.\u2018Is this a coincidence?\u2019There is no such thing in the novel.\u201cWhy is there such a coincidence?\u2019At the moment, she felt dizzy.\u2018Uh\u2026 oh, I feel dizzy.\u2019Tundra agonized a thousand more times in his head.Should I poke it?Should I not?This girl in front of me is too small to get stabbed.However, she somehow looked threatening.\u2018Is this the boss\u2019s daughter\u2026?\u2019The way she behaved without hesitation and the clothes she was wearing was rather luxurious.\u201cIf she\u2019s really the boss\u2019 daughter\u2026\u201d He clenched his teeth.\u2018No matter how young she is, I can\u2019t forgive you.\u2019Tundra asked, \u201cAre you the boss\u2019 daughter?\u201d\u201cAnswer me. Are you the boss\u2019s daughter?\u201dViola did not answer.No, she couldn\u2019t answer.After making eye contact with Tundra, Viola felt dizzier and dizzier.\u2018Why do I feel so dizzy\u2026 huh?\u2019At that moment, she felt that the eyes of Tundra had become huge.His huge eyes got bigger, it looked as if he was approaching her.I felt like I saw something I shouldn\u2019t see.Teuk!She felt like something was breaking inside her head.At that moment.Tundra, who was looking for a chance to escape, quickly stretched out his arms.He raised his arms that had a knife and aimed it at Viola\u2019s neck.He spoke to Xenon. \u201cGuide me to the boss. Otherwise, she\u2019ll die!\u201dBut then.A faint voice escaped from Viola\u2019s lips.\u201cAre you seriously pointing a knife at me?\u201dViola\u2019s eyes and spirits changed in a flash.Xenon grinned.\u201cI think you\u2019re going to show your true self now, Princess Verratoux.\u201dIn the eyes of Xenon, Viola\u2019s behavior was strange.How dare she approach him so defenselessly and lift his leg?She continued to show a state of being overly defenseless.\u2018You\u2019ve exposed your weakness.\u2019Then, he understood the situation.\u2018It looked like Princess Viola was interested in the little boy.\u2019 That\u2019s why she provoked him on purpose.The stimulated boy pointed the knife at the princess.\u2018Everything is going the way she wanted.\u2019The princess\u2019s operation looked like a complete success.\u2018So, what are you going to do now?\u2019Viola Verratoux finally revealed her true feelings.They decided to wait and see how she would move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A voice escaped Viola\u2019s lips.Viola\u2019s eyes were a little red.\u201cDid you just point a knife at me?\u201dViola slapped Tundra on the cheek.Slap!Tundra\u2019s cheeks swelled red and just collapsed helplessly.It happened in a blink of an eye when Viola slowly crushed Tundra.\u201cThis hybrid dog.\u201dSoon, Viola crushed Tundra\u2019s back with her knees. She pushed Tundra on his back and shoved the dagger into his mouth.\u201cHmm. What happens if I put pressure on the side?\u201dArin\u2019s consciousness struggled, shouting, \u2018This isn\u2019t it!\u2019Her body was out of control. It felt like it was taken over by the real Viola.\u2018I have to take over again.\u2019She had to get back somehow.\u2018If I leave it like this\u2026\u2019It really seemed like something terrible was going to happen.And Arin knew. \u2018Tundra can resist if he wants to.\u2019It wasn\u2019t because he couldn\u2019t resist and just stayed still. Tundra\u2019s talent and Viola\u2019s talents were neck and neck, assuming that neither received any education.It was not like the male lead was helpless.Though, he\u2019s not resisting.Arin read Tundra\u2019s mind.\u2018I came all the way here for revenge, but I just want to give up.\u2019\u2018I think it\u2019s over now.\u2019Arin knows how that feels. That was how she felt in middle school.Her mom died a long time ago, so she wasn\u2019t there. Her dad said that he was coming for her, but he just left her behind.People around her shuddered due to the fact that she didn\u2019t have any parents or guardians. She didn\u2019t have much reason to live.\u2018I\u2019ll be there for you.\u2019If it wasn\u2019t for Kang Han-Joon, Arin might have jumped off the roof that day. Tundra\u2019s psychological state was clearly visible.He must already have a hunch that his sister is dead. So, he is afraid to move forward.He doesn\u2019t have the courage to face his father\u2019s body.\u2018So I\u2019d rather just die here.\u2019 He was heartbroken.It was heartbreaking to think that he would be thinking that way with that kind of reaction on his face and body.\u2018Huh? He\u2019s moving.\u2019His body moved, and he slowly regained his consciousness.She glanced behind her. Xenon stood there with a very pleased expression.When Vixen came, he looked a little defeated. His lips just went agape.Xenon said with a grin.\u201cClean work, princess.\u201dViola was heartbroken.She didn\u2019t expect it. \u2018Is this a side effect of her possessing this body?\u2019But first, she felt like she had to deal with the current situation.\u201cThis bastard, I like this person.\u201dShe hid the dagger in her arms.It was a relief that she came to her senses before she stabbed him in the throat.Viola pointed to Tundra.\u201cI\u2019ll make this my toy.\u201d***In a carriage going back to the duchy.Vixen showed off his strength. \u201cI killed seven bad guys.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t such a beautiful story to tell. It\u2019s like it went in one ear and out the other.\u201cBut Viola.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWho else did you apply medicine to, besides me?\u201d\u201cNo one.\u201d\u201cThen, I am the first?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVixen\u2019s eyes narrowed.He looked out the window with a murky breath. He felt strange.\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYou know, Viola.\u201dVixen did not hide his innermost thoughts.\u201cDon\u2019t apply ointment to anyone other than me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dVixen actually didn\u2019t know how he felt.He just hated it.\u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous poison, right?\u201dThe ointment is a dangerous poison?\u2026Since when?\u201cMy heart feels so thin, and my body is floating. I\u2019m laughing and crying. The side effects are very serious.\u201dAh.Please be my guest.\u201cIt would have been very dangerous if you were an ordinary person who isn\u2019t a Verratoux.\u201d\u201cAn average person?\u201d\u201cVerratoux are born with a blessed body and a large amount of mana. Though it\u2019s dangerous for me, too, so how would it be for an average person?\u201dViola sighed.\u201cWhy are you sighing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201dMy mind felt complicated in many ways. I care about Tundra, who was being carried like groceries in a cart, and I feel sorry for Vixen, who believes it is poison from the bottom of his heart.\u201cVixen.\u201d\u201cI said to call me brother.\u201d\u201cYeah, Vixen oppa.\u201d Vixen smiled brightly after hearing that.\u201cYes. Why?\u201d\u201cAn ointment is not a poison. So, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201dVixen is stubborn.\u201cYou know it\u2019s medicine, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dVixen\u2019s face turned red.As he talked to Viola, he could understand. Why does he not like it?\u201cI don\u2019t like when others feel.\u201dVixen wanted to monopolize the mood.\u201cIf you apply ointment, others will feel the same way I do.\u201dNormally, I don\u2019t feel that way when applying ointment.Viola was about to say something.That\u2019s when Vixen clapped his hands. We spoke over each other in the process.\u201cOh! I have an idea.\u201dHe grinned. What if Viola applied ointment to someone else?\u201cWe can just get rid of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThen, I would be the only one in the world who would receive ointment from you.\u201dVixen\u2019s heart was relieved to realize the fact.There was a smile on her face. She felt like she was out of it.***When Viola came back to her room, Xenon laid down Tundra around his shoulder.Tundra was still unconscious.Tundra\u2019s wrists and ankles were chained together with harnesses [ magical equipment ] that control movement and mana.It was heartbreaking to see him wearing harnesses on his hands and feet, covering his mouth like a slave. Viola looked at Tundra silently.\u2018No, it\u2019s not him.\u2019And even though it\u2019s not.They looked exactly the same. It\u2019s just their eyes that are different.Viola moved away and sat on a chair.Viola could see herself in the mirror. No wicked woman should do such a wicked act. She still doesn\u2019t know. Whether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201cWhat about the toy, princess?\u201dViola replied in the most Viola\u2019s way. \u201cPretty good, put it on display.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Xenon injects a little mana, the chain moves on its own. It then unfolded.Tundra\u2019s limbs spread out from side to side.It looks like it\u2019s crossed.Viola grinned.\u201cThat\u2019s all right. Get out.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWell, since he\u2019s a dog, he needs discipline, right?\u201cIf you need anything, please call me, Princess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFor now, I need to send Xenon away.Viola, who sent Xenon out, racked her head.\u201cOh, what do I do?\u201d\u2018How can I discipline him? I only brought him here to save his life.There was a sound of chains moving.Ugh. A faint groan was also heard.Before I knew it, Tundra began to wake up.\u201cW-what the!\u201d Tundra, who came to his senses, was shocked.He couldn\u2019t pronounce his words properly because of the harness that blocked his mouth.Viola sat in a chair and watched Tundra for a while. He glared at Viola.\u201cLet me out of here!\u201dHis mouth was watering. Tundra\u2019s spirit did not die even after he had just been treated like an animal.He felt shocked for the first time since he met Viola. He met such a young girl in that kind of cottage, but now, the situation has changed. In Tundra\u2019s head, Viola is the perfect enemy.A monster who pushed a knife into his mouth and spread his flesh.\u201cGod, I will kill you!!\u201dHe was able to recover his senses even after he saw the scene.Right. He\u2019s not her brother.He would always smile in front of Arin. He would stand beside her like a strong tree.\u2026He looked at the wild animals and didn\u2019t act so badly\u2018They just look alike.\u2019She made up her mind. \u2018Yes, it was just the face.\u2019Clack, clack, clack!Tundra kept struggling, and the harnesses rattled violently.Tundra, who was screaming with excitement, looked as though he wanted to tear Viola apart.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dPhew.Viola took a deep breath.It\u2019s all right. Everything\u2019s going to be okay.She knows what character Tundra is better than anyone else.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Let me go!\u201dViola waited in silence until Tundra calmed down.\u2018Tundra is a reasonable and smart character.\u2019He\u2019s just too young now, and he didn\u2019t receive a proper education. Tundra lost all his family members, and now he was kidnapped, so he seemed to have lost his reason to live.But now, he had to bring himself together.\u201cYou went into the cabin by yourself. How was the result? You\u2019ve only killed two people, and you\u2019ve been terribly injured.\u201dViola deliberately poked Tundra in the chest.\u201cAnd you ended up doing nothing, hiding in a corner and shivering, without even knowing about your sister\u2019s death. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cUggghhh!\u201d Tundra roared.\u201cIf I were you, I would have wanted to give up everything. Cowardly. You might have thought that it would be better to die, me, too. I was an orphan.\u201dAt that moment, Tundra\u2019s body stopped.\u201cMy mother died, and my father abandoned me. And now I have been adopted.\u201dWhen I entered the orphanage, Kang Han-Joon said this.\u2018My name is Kang Han-Joon.\u2019\u201cMy name is Viola Verratoux.\u201dHe told me this.\u2018You\u2019ve been abandoned.\u2019He didn\u2019t always comfort me with warm words. He told me the reality with his soft eyes. Looking back, it was better that way. He said he\u2019d come back someday.It\u2019s going to be okay.Adults\u2019 lies made young Arin imbued with useless hope. And that hope made her suffer more.The higher the hope he built, the more it would hurt when I crashed.\u201cYour father and sister are dead.\u201dThere was another thing Kang Han-Joon said to Arin, who thought the world had collapsed.\u2018It\u2019s not gonna be okay.\u2019\u2018But I\u2019ll still be there for you.\u2019With what he said, it was like magic that made Arin rise.\u201cIt won\u2019t be okay.\u201d Although the situation was different, the situation was still similar.\u201cBut I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201dWhat Kang Han joon said to Arin.Viola said it to Tundra.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Well, she did pay me five years ago, and I ended up coming back\u2026\u2019I was afraid and hoped the godmother doesn\u2019t hate Hanael as well.She clutched Sierra\u2019s hand and said.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re finally here, Sierra.\u201dSierra faltered when she saw her teary eyes.\u2018That\u2019s weird?\u2019Sierra glanced at her. However, the godmother was steadfast and serious.I was a little scared when I saw her mouth closed and her stubborn eyes.\u201cMadam, what do you mean\u2026\u201dOf course, the godmother was thinking differently.That day, when she recalled Sierra\u2019s eyes, one corner of her heart felt too heavy.She was thinner now than the Sierra five years ago. She\u2019s become more vulnerable and can disappear at any moment. The godmother clenched her fist quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s just as I said. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201dThe godmother\u2019s voice crept out. Sierra looked at her one more time in embarrassment. Her eyes proved she didn\u2019t understand the situation.The godmother breathed a long sigh.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll pay for my bad karma\u2026\u201dLooking at Sierra\u2019s trembling shoulders, she looked thinner than before. The godmother gave a long sigh and grabbed Sierra\u2019s hand tightly.\u201cLong time no see, marchioness. I\u2019m sorry, we meet again.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s there for you to be sorry for?\u201d\u201cY\u2026 You gave me the money back then, but I stand right in front of you again\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Sierra.\u201dThe godmother\u2019s face distorted when she saw Sierra\u2019s warmhearted expression. She had to pay for her past sins.How long has she been waiting to be kind to Sierra?!\u201cYes, I did\u2026 something terrible to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dOf course, Sierra didn\u2019t understand her remorseful feelings.The godmother handed her money, and Sierra received it. In her eyes, it was just that.\u2018Has she weakened a lot over the years?\u2019Her gray hair became more grayish, and she opened her mouth in a quiet tone.\u201cWhen you left, Cassius became\u2026 I\u2019ve regretted it for five years. Now that I\u2019ve met you again, I want to be more kind.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s when I separated you from Cassius\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 You did?\u201d\u201cYes, asking you to leave Cassius\u2026 was the most regrettable mistake I\u2019ve made in my entire life.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026? Why?\u201d\u201cA moment\u2019s misjudgment led to my nephew, Cassius, being ruined for more than five years\u2026\u201dNo, that was enough to ruin him?Seeing how Cassius used to look fuller, but now his face shows he has lost weight, proved this was a bit serious. I didn\u2019t know it was that bad.\u201cThere is darkness in my family. It hurt my heart\u2026 I regretted it.\u201dWhen she saw her, Sierra realized.What\u2026 This is definitely strange.\u201cIt\u2019s been very tough, child.\u201d\u201c\u2026I lived well. I was very happy you gave me that money.\u201dThe godmother\u2019s eyes shook.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. A pure child like you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me to not feel guilty, right? You said that five years ago\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not what I meant.\u201dThough the godmother already mistook her as an overly pure child.Well, how should I deal with this?While Sierra was pondering, the godmother seemed to have already confirmed everything.\u201cHa\u2026 What on earth did I do to you back then\u2026\u201d<noscript></noscript>I\u2019m sorry, but you seem to be creating dark history, madam\u2026However, she clasped Sierra\u2019s hands even harder without any refutation.\u201cSierra, thank you for coming back. I\u2019ll take good care of you and your child.\u201dWell, things are definitely going crazy.Sierra thought seriously.\u201cThank you for your words, madam. I\u2019ll only be here for three months. I\u2019m leaving after Hanael\u2019s paternity test.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe godmother\u2019s eyes turned red. She looked upright and cold-blooded, but her heart was weak.\u201cYes, Yes. Of course, you want to leave. You\u2019ve had a hard time, and you feel damaged\u2026\u201dOh\u2026This person looks like a stubborn wall.She\u2019s similar to Cassius.Sierra is now beginning to look deeper into the situation.In three months, the paternity test results will be revealed, and this misunderstanding will come to an end. So, I can politely prove them wrong.\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t suffer much, but I\u2019m grateful for your kind deeds\u2026\u201dSierra decided to lay an iron plate. For now, she emphasized several times that Hanael was not Cassius\u2019 daughter. It was the people in this family who did not believe her. She is innocent.Sierra thought of a great quote.If you can\u2019t avoid it, enjoy it\u2026!However, it may be impossible to just enjoy this recklessly.Cassius and the Marchioness of Mails, their scales were beyond Sierra\u2019s imagination!***A week has passed.And during that time, we faced an era of cataclysmic change.Cassius acquired all the toy-selling companies for Hanael, just as he did for Sierra. Sierra felt like she was watching a happy ending in a romance novel sold out to the world. The problem is that she is not the main character of the romance novel.In addition, Cassius said he \u201cstill lacks a lot.\u201d It\u2019s all too much for Sierra\u2026 The more he does this, the more anxious she becomes.\u2018Cassius, are you serious?\u2019Cassius consistently asked Sierra out on a date. He ignored her rejections and was bombarding her with gifts. As if to comfort the wounded Sierra with gifts\u2026.And all his attention made Sierra feel unintentionally fraudulent. Feeling burdened, she closed the door and continued to study medicine in her room, asking for her friends\u2019 addresses.Sierra\u2019s actions started a butterfly effect\u2026\u201cWell, it seems Miss Sierra isn\u2019t accepting courtship.\u201d\u201cOh, dear\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s returning to where she came from!\u201d\u2026It\u2019s caused a tremendous stir in the duke\u2019s mansion. Even the words of his servants were heard by Sierra. It was thanks to Hanael, who ran around the duke\u2019s mansion like it was her own home.\u201cIt\u2019s rumored that my mom hates the weird man!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t hate\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t hate that strange man? Even though he left us behind?\u201d\u201cThat strange man is just strangely delusional\u2026\u201dSierra decided to put up with it for now, although it was a bit unsettling. It was a very comfortable misunderstanding for Sierra. Besides, I signed the contract so that we would have no disadvantage!Of course, even though it had only been a week, the mansion was rearranged around Sierra.Not only Cassius, but also the godmother who is in charge of the duke\u2019s estate was as dramatic as Cassius.\u2018I guess the godmother didn\u2019t lie when she said she regretted things for five years. I don\u2019t understand why she would, but\u2026\u2019Sierra was dragged into tea time with the godmother again today. She tried to find Sierra\u2019s favorite tea by helping her taste various different teas. Teas that exceeded her monthly salary were randomly placed on the table per leaf.\u201cYou\u2019re too precious to me\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I love it.\u201dSierra had a big appetite. She could eat anything well.\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you with whatever you want. Is there anything else you want to do?\u201dIt\u2019s nice to have a strong supporter.\u201cIf you hold a tea party, I\u2019d like to be your chaperone.\u201dThe godmother sighed low, placing her hand near her heart. Sierra shook her head. That\u2019s too much! That\u2019s too much!\u201cChaperone? I\u2019m a commoner, so I can\u2019t make my debut\u2026\u201d\u201cCommoner?\u201dHer eyes became very fierce.\u201c\u2026Who dares to look down on you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf someone refers to you as a commoner, you must tell me.\u201dNo, this world was a noble-centered society.Although Sierra\u2019s older sister is a greater archmage than most nobles\u2026 people don\u2019t know that. Sierra had the godmother\u2019s attention and replied awkwardly.\u201c\u2026I-It\u2019s fine. Nothing special happened. Oh, I\u2019d like to ask you a favor.\u201dCassius was very anxious that Sierra would run away. Perhaps that\u2019s why he seemed to want to prevent Sierra from seeing others.I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s like he\u2019s building a beautiful cage\u2026Of course, Sierra didn\u2019t want to do anything to provoke the already sensitive Cassius.\u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend, Lina, who graduated from the Academy of Medicine\u2026 It\u2019s been five years and I can\u2019t find where she is.\u201d\u201cAh, your friend\u2026\u201dThe godmother had a heartbreaking look on her face.\u201cYou left this capital because of me, and you haven\u2019t been able to contact your friends for five years\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, it\u2019s not your fault I left the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, yes.\u201dSeeing her eyes moisten, she didn\u2019t seem to believe Sierra\u2019s words at all.Sierra decided to leave. They won\u2019t listen to me anyway. I\u2019ll just let them misunderstand!\u201cI wonder what exactly happened over the past five years, though especially, I wonder how the marchioness, a noble, turned out like this\u2026\u201dSierra recalled Lina, a friend from the Academy of Medicine who was called the capital\u2019s source of information. Lina may have a clue about this incident.The godmother had a keen observation with her eyes. She continued once again.\u201cYour friend\u2026 Lina from the Academy of Medicine. I\u2019ll start looking immediately. I\u2019ll invite her to this estate, and we can have a chat.\u201dIt was Sierra\u2019s first request, which made her nervous no matter what she asked her.The godmother was almost sixty years old but swore to complete her mission well. Sierra was a little embarrassed to see her like that, but\u2026For now, I decided to endure this situation for three months and enjoy it.***Meanwhile, there was a strange rumor circulating in society.There is a woman staying at Duke Idios\u2019 estate. But she\u2019s a witch. This witch uses magic to charm the godmother and Cassius, and she\u2019s doing whatever she wants. This witch is very charming\u2026\u201cCrazy.\u201dAndante, the wife of Marquis Mails and the godmother\u2019s daughter-in-law, frowned when she heard the rumors of a low-class society.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The wounds increased one by one.Viola\u2019s eyes turned red.\u2018I\u2019m in pain.\u2019In Arin\u2019s point of view, Tundra is a child.Meanwhile, Tundra\u2019s head cooled off.\u2018If you scream from the beginning, the butler will doubt you.\u2019The whipping continued for a long time. And as Viola and Tundra had expected, Xenon heard the whipping sound in the next room.\u201cIt looks like she had started disciplining and taming him.\u201d He got up slowly and put his ears on the wall.\u201cWow, that must hurt.\u201dAfter a long time, he could hear a faint groan.There was also a faint breathing sound that forced him to endure pain.Xenon had seen Tundra\u2019s hard weep.He had a firm look in his eyes. The fact that a child with such a look groans that much means that she is brutally harassing him.\u201cHow cruel is she really?\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to kill. However, it is difficult to make such a painful moan.I\u2019ve seen her type a lot.They\u2019re not bent for it, even if they\u2019re broken.Xenon was evaluating Tundra as such.\u201cI guess she\u2019s really trying to make him give in.\u201dHis eyes drew a line.\u201cThat\u2019s a Verratoux like way, Princess.\u201d***When Tundra was moaning, someone came to the room.\u201cViola! Are you having fun?\u201dIt was Vixen, the Fifth Prince. Vixen\u2019s eyes were twinkling. It was the eyes of a predator who found a new prey or toy.\u201cHehehe.\u201dHe saw Tundra in pain. Vixen then looked at him with strange eyes.\u201cBut you know what?\u201dIt was like a young predator who found its prey.\u201cAre you going to put some medicine on him, too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSince Viola was silent, Vixen repeated his question.\u201cHe\u2019s hurt. Are you going to put some medicine on him?\u201d\u201cIs that important?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201dViola thought Vixen was a little absurd.Why\u2019s it important?Vixen squinted his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d better not apply the medicine on him.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cPut some medicine on him, and I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d\u201cBut what is the reason?\u201dWhen Viola kept asking why, Vixen felt as if he was feeling a heartache.\u201cJust\u2026!\u201d\u201cJust, why?\u201d\u201cJust! Just! Just! Just\u2026! I\u2019m going to kill him! Do you understand?\u201d Vixen\u2019s eyes were full of life. His ears were fluttering.Viola sat on the chair. My stomach was burning up in front of Vixen, who was making no sense, but I didn\u2019t show it. Fortunately, Vixen is weak in verbal fights.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I put medicine on my toys or not.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s a different story if you try to kill my toys. I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ve invaded my space.\u201d\u201cHh, hum, that doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is I don\u2019t want you to put medicine on anyone else.\u201d\u201cWhy? Give me a reason so I can understand. You\u2019re a Verratoux.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Vixen\u2019s face heated up in red beet.\u201cBecause it\u2019s my first experience!\u201dViola was speechless at the moment. I wondered if the word that came out was correct, but Vixen\u2019s intention was purely transparent.\u201cSo, you don\u2019t want to lose your first experience to anyone else?\u201dVixen nodded.\u201cNow, brother, you know you\u2019re being stubborn, right?\u201cNo? Don\u2019t you know me?\u201dVixen\u2019s acting like he\u2019s someone else. He seemed to insist, \u2018I know I\u2019m stubborn!\u2019\u201cI learned that Verratoux is a rational family. But I\u2019m a little bit disappointed in you. Are you all right with this\u201d\u201cD-disappointed?\u201d Vixen\u2019s expression got a little dark.He thought he showed Viola a little of his brotherly greatness while destroying the bandits, but she was disappointed with the way he acted.\u201cWell, I\u2019m still a little disappointed\u2026\u201d\u201cGive me logical grounds and rational conditions that I can understand. I\u2019ll do whatever I want until then. I want you to act more like a Verratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf not, then this is far-fetched as it is right now.\u201dViola\u2019s eyes squinted, and she laughed.\u201cFrom now on, I will never apply ointment again.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll forgive you this time.\u201dVixen was incredibly quick to change his attitude.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo. I mean, I\u2019ll forgive him for the time being, if you apply medicine to him.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re forcing me again?\u201d\u201cOh, come on! Just put it on him.\u201dVixen slammed the door as if he was nervous and went out.\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you. You\u2019ll see when you\u2019re ten.\u201dI meant it when I said that. When he returned to the room, he was carried away by strange emotions.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s only natural for siblings to compete by slaughtering each other.Her small hand that applied the ointment came up in his head.\u2018Do I have to kill her?\u2019Though\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want to kill Viola.\u2018I\u2019m gonna have to kill her, right?\u2019Because that\u2019s what Verratoux siblings do, right?But do we have to? I don\u2019t know.I want someone to tell me the answer.A very small wave of thought began to appear in Vixen\u2019s mind.***After all the fuss.Xenon opened the door to Viola\u2019s room. He approached the fallen Tundra.\u201cThe boy pointed a knife at my Princess. I didn\u2019t even put a knife against her neck.\u201dFor a moment, Viola\u2019s body flinched. She felt a flutter of life in Xenon\u2019s body. It was awful.She felt like she was in hell.\u201cIf my Princess hadn\u2019t been generous, I would have pulled out all your teeth and ripped your mouth apart.\u201dViola was shocked, as if she had been hit on the head.\u2018It\u2019s not just for me.\u2019This was a test. The Butler, Xenon\u2019s test for the heroine, Viola. It was a very similar line in the novel.\u300c \u201cIf our princess was not generous, I would rip your throat.\u201d \u300dThe content was a little different, but the feel was the same as the original.For a Verratoux, \u2018generosity\u2019 is a luxury. You must have the strength to be generous. Only an absolute man such as Duke Heron would have it. Being generous without that much power means being foolish and weak.This is what a Verratoux should be.Viola said. \u201cXenon.\u201d\u201cYes, Princess.\u201d\u201cUh.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to make this boy kneel down?\u201dViola was deliberately silent. Time has slipped along.\u201cI want you to kneel.\u201dEventually, Xenon walked to the front of Viola, then started to bend slowly.This is how it was done in the original story.He fell on his knees and I slapped him across the face.\u201cDon\u2019t test me.\u201d\u300c \u201cI\u2019ll kill you next time.\u201d \u300dBut he looked at Tundra, who was right next to me. Though I thought it was not good to scold him in front of the Tundra because he was my person.\u201cXenon, come with me.\u201dJust as Vixen\u2019s room was huge, so was Viola\u2019s.It was divided into a living room and several more rooms.Xenon walked silently behind Viola.I closed the door and couldn\u2019t see Tundra anymore.\u201cDear.\u201d\u201cYes, Princess.\u201dXenon was not particularly rebellious.\u2018I gotta hit him on the cheek, right?\u2019This is not what a person should do. But I decided to hit him.It didn\u2019t matter how she felt inside.Her butler who tested the PrincessThe butler was caught. Of course, he should be scolded greatly. She will act more like a Verratoux if she scolds him.Slap!I slapped him in the face.I didn\u2019t know how hard it should be, so I just hit as hard as I could. I thought it would be okay if I hit twenty Imperial knights by myself.Strike!Xenon\u2019s neck turned sideways. Xenon\u2019s lips are a little chapped. Blood quickly formed, and Xenon\u2019s cheek was engraved with a handprint that looked like an earthquake.\u2018I-I\u2019m sorry!\u2019A Verratoux had to act this way. I thought I hit him too hard, but it was already past. He continued to pretend to be as calm as possible.\u201cIt\u2019s good to test my qualifications as Verratoux. But don\u2019t let it show. \u2018Cause I\u2019m really offended.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHow easy is it for me to prove to you that I am capable enough?\u201d\u201cI apologized. As a token of my apology, why don\u2019t I give you my arm?\u201dNo!This shouldn\u2019t be a thing!Don\u2019t give it to me!Why does it feel like he is being serious? Viola wanted to cry, but she smirked on the outside.\u201cDo you think you can apologize with just your arm?\u201d\u201cThen, would it be okay if I give you my life?\u201dA cold sweat ran down Viola\u2019s back.I couldn\u2019t ask because I thought he would say yes if I asked if he were being serious.\u201cThen you can\u2019t work for me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIf your arm is cut off, the efficiency of your job will be reduced as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also true.\u201dMy face turned a little pale when I said something that didn\u2019t suit my personality.\u201cI\u2019ll make you act a little more skillful. That\u2019s why I\u2019m testing you and keeping you alive.\u201d\u201cThank you, Princess.\u201dXenon noticed that Viola looked pale. He could figure out the reason. \u2018She\u2019s deliberately controlling her blood-boiling madness.\u2019If it is Viola Verratoux, which Xenon identified as the murderer who was relentlessly pushing the dagger into the boy\u2019s mouth, would be extremely excited now. I\u2019m sure she felt bad enough.But in a way, Viola was controlling her madness.\u2018She\u2019s desperate enough to sweat.\u2019She is not fit for discipline and rationalism at the age of seven. Viola was controlling her anger and leading the situation to her best advantage.Viola Verratoux is not just a blood-crazy killer.Her cruelty and charisma combined with her resourcefulness together are just so amazing. There is no Verratoux who showed this much promise at the age of seven.Xenon raised himself. There is one more thing to point out.\u201cDid you have to bring me here to instill my prestige in front of the toy?\u201d\u201cFor now, you\u2019re my only closest aide.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Xenon had a slightly strange feeling.Viola Verratoux is extremely Verratouxistic.He truly felt it when he was slapped. This person is more like Verratoux than any pureblood Verratoux.\u201cYou\u2019re being considerate.\u201dA strange gap occurred.She\u2019s so similar to a Verratoux, but she\u2019s also strangely different from a Verratoux.A pure-blooded Verratoux would not have given such consideration. Moreover, he is the one and only closest person to her.\u2018The Princess is a wonderful person.\u2019I didn\u2019t hate her novelty. A Verratoux, who is more Verratoux-like than anyone else, is unfamiliar and good.Xenon grinned.\u201cIf you rule Verratoux, I thought it would make me happy. I will start to listen to you with all my heart.\u201dViola\u2019s breath is suffocating. First of all, she survived today. It felt like something was a little too much.Xenon returned to his room and compiled a diary of what happened today.\u2018She slapped me in the face.\u2019Also\u2026 \u2018I had come to my senses.\u2019\u201cHow can there be such a brute force even if she is small\u2026\u201dThe Duke\u2019s words made sense.She was born a star.If he hadn\u2019t raised his mana to protect himself momentarily, his skull would have been smashed. That kind of power is not that of a child\u2019s. It is the power of the knight who can handle mana skillfully.[ She is born with natural talent. ]What\u2019s surprising is that she didn\u2019t get any education about Mana. In my personal opinion, it is second to or even more than the First Princess.Xenon recalled one more fact. \u2018When she first met Prince Vixen\u2026 when she threw the pens, there was mana in it.\u2019Vixen also raised mana to protect himself. Though, strangely, Viola had pierced the shield very easily.This is because mana was embedded in the pen she threw.He added a phrase again.[ She was born with the purest Mana Class. ][ What is certain is that she is born with a higher mana amount than Prince Vixen. ]Princess Viola doesn\u2019t seem to know it yet, though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just looking at his state, it felt like he was going to run out of breath right away.\u2018He had to get used to the set up in the novel.\u2019Tundra has two appearances.He has a strong liking for her as a ruler. Tundra falls in love with Viola\u2019s dominion in the original novel.However, he always feels deficient in his heart. Tundra, who had been abandoned by his mother, was in a state of lacking self-awareness. He longs for a warm and benevolent appearance to Viola.Though, there is no such characteristic in Viola, in the original novel.Later, Tundra was stabbed to death by Viola. Novels flow in a direction that was not a happy ending for everyone.Arin thought it would be nice if the novel went on a more beautiful plot.Tundra spoke quietly. \u201c\u2026Is that\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is it?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u2018It won\u2019t be okay.\u2019\u2018But I\u2019ll be next to you.\u2019That\u2019s\u2026He wanted to ask if she was serious, but before Viola answered, Tundra fainted.Three hours later.Tundra finally came to his senses again.\u201c\u2026What should I do now?\u201dHe just has to be healthy and take my side. His very existence itself would be a big help to me. If I introduce him to Lord Hixen later, he\u2019ll be his Sword Master.Tundra concluded by himself.\u201cYou said you needed an extremely loyal dog, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cDo I have to call you my master?\u201d\u201cYes, that would be better.\u201dTundra was lost in thought for a moment. Then, he nodded his head.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be your dog, master.\u201d He responded.I am very determined, but I still felt ashamed and uncomfortable to hear such things.\u2018This is a fantasy world.\u2019I can\u2019t be naive in this world.Meanwhile, Tundra adjusted very quickly to this kind of situation.He then continued with an expression and tone that did not contain any hint of emotions.\u201cI\u2019ll bark if you want me to cry, I\u2019ll open my stomach if you want me to, and I\u2019ll lick your feet if you want me to. I\u2019m going to be yours and yours only.\u201d\u2018No, wait a second.\u2019I\u2019ve never said that before, have I? Why are you licking my feet that are dirty?\u201cSo, keep your word.\u201d\u201cWhat promise?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not okay, but I promise I\u2019ll be next to you.\u201dViola glanced at Tundra.I haven\u2019t seen him for long.My heart is so broken. I haven\u2019t seen Kang Han-Joon for a long time. The last time I did, I was a mess.\u201cYour promise\u2026keep your word.\u201dTundra\u2019s eyes reddened.He wanted someone to be next to him. He just wants someone besides him.Viola knew it well. She barely answered.\u201cRespect. Be pure. Habits are important.\u201dTundra nodded, gave her a \u2018Male Lead\u2019 look, and answered her with the same aura.\u201cYes, I will be your dog and will help you swallow Verratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tomorrow. Let\u2019s go to your father.\u201dI commanded Xenon to prepare a chrysanthemum flower.***In front of the ruined cabin.Tundra wielded a wooden bat and screamed.\u201cGet out of here, you motherfuckers!\u201dThere was a bald eagle that kept coming back, and it was digging up Tundra\u2019s father\u2019s body. Tundra held his father\u2019s body and cried for a long time.\u201cYou said you\u2019d stay with me! You promised me you wouldn\u2019t abandon me, but you still abandoned me!\u201dHe cried and cried for such a long time. Viola isn\u2019t particularly comforting him.She just let him be.No consolation would reach him right now.Kang Hanjoon did the same to me. Instead of uttering words, he just stayed by my side. It was already great support for the little Arin.Viola approached Tundra.\u2018I will just stay by your side.\u2019Tundra looked up to Viola after sobbing for a while on his knees.Seeing his face covered with tears and mucus, Viola avoided his eyes, which were filled with sadness.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you hug me?\u201dViola\u2019s body flinched. \u2018With that kind of face?\u2019With Kang Han joon\u2019s face and body.You\u2019re not my usual oppa, who would say, \u2018Don\u2019t be so pathetic.\u2019Though it was just so irresistible, she approached Tundra and hugged him slightly, and patted him on the back.The twelve-year-old Tundra is much larger than the seven-year-old Viola.Viola felt like she was the young Arin again.Thump, thump.My heart continuously pounds.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019However, it was far from a rational feeling.\u2018This feeling again.\u2019 Her consciousness became blurry again.This happened whenever I looked at Tundra\u2019s eyes for too long or whenever I touched him.\u2018Uh\u2026r\u2026wahh.\u2019Xenon, who was watching quietly from behind, noticed it.\u2018Your real aptitude appeared again!\u2019He could see it in Viola\u2019s eyes. Xenon is a little excited to see that.\u2018Now you can stab the back of that toy to death any time. She does look like she was practicing it in secret.\u2019Her eyes proved it. Viola\u2019s reddened eyes and Xenon\u2019s eyes met.Viola grinned.It was a mysterious smile of blood-crazy murder, that had found her toy. Viola\u2019s eyes were filled with a murderous aura and curiosity at the same time.She was looking at him as if she wanted to stab, kill, and just be filled in a frenzy.\u2018She is very much like a Verratoux right now.\u2019 However, at the same time, sometimes not so much.\u2018Since she\u2019s an adopted daughter, she is different. She\u2019s not even a pure-blood Verratoux.\u2019Princess Viola\u2019s move was expected. It is impressive to see her changing her mask so naturally.At that age, wearing a mask and using tricks like that.Tundra dug his father\u2019s grave on the ground. His hand was bleeding, but he didn\u2019t care. He then laid his father on the deep ground. His father was buried deep enough that the mountain animals could not dig him up again.Tundra dropped his head in front of his father\u2019s tomb.\u201cFather.\u201dOf course, he didn\u2019t get an answer.\u201cThank you for being by my side.\u201dAlthough he was a poor father, Tundra was proud to have him as his father.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Someone else is next to me now. She will stay by my side.\u201dViola brought out the chrysanthemum flower. Tundra took it from her.He wiped his tears bravely and laid down the chrysanthemum flower in front of his father\u2019s tomb.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now. You\u2019ve been through a lot. There\u2019s no suffering now. Please relax in the sky.\u201dViola and Tundra came back to the room.\u201cXenon.\u201dXenon opened the door and came in.\u201cDid you call me, Princess?\u201d\u201cHey, I don\u2019t like that thing.\u201dHe pointed his finger at Tundra. His body flinched.\u201cThen, shall we kill him now?\u201d\u201cGive him a room and feed him warm food.\u201dTundra is not in a very good condition. Even considering that this place is a lot wealthier than her original world. Maybe Tundra grew up without eating properly. He is a poor hunter\u2019s son, after all.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cMy dog, when it\u2019s kneeling like this, my dignity goes down.\u201d Viola smiled lightly.Her expression was full of elegance and grace.That\u2019s what Xenon saw.\u201cEverything I have should be all beautiful, even if it\u2019s a toy.\u201d\u2018So, eat a lot of delicious food and cheer up.\u2019If Han-Joon looks handsome, I would get annoyed by him first.Though I do feel weird.\u2026Am I becoming a tsundere?\u201cXenon, do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s good reasoning.\u201dXenon is convinced, she is impressive.\u2018Everything I have should be beautiful, even if it\u2019s a toy.\u2019 Her words were very Verratoux like reasoning.He bent down deeply.\u201cMaster, I accept you, Viola, as a Verratoux, my Princess.\u201dVerratoux seemed to have a strange emphasis, but Viola didn\u2019t pay much attention.Hours went by.\u2018It\u2019s almost time. Vixen\u2019s going to be beaten up and moan in pain again.\u2019Not only did I need Tundra on my side, but I also had to make Vixen side with me as well.\u2018I have a long way to go.\u2019I then headed to Vixen\u2019s room. But there was an unexpected person who was waiting for Viola.Vixen, who collapsed in blood, was under her feet.Red hair that resembles fire, and eyes that look like salmosa.Pale skinRed plump lips that look like she just ate strawberries.She had a strange atmosphere as though she was a witch from somewhere remote. However, she is a strangely beautiful woman. Viola quickly realized who that woman was.\u201cDuchess Isabella.\u201dThe most influential figure in this familyShe was the Duchess of Heron, who had power supporting her.There is no love between Duke Heron and her, but they are faithful to each other.\u201cYou must be Princess Viola.\u201d\u201cHello, Duchess Isabella.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you recognized me at once. You must have studied hard.\u201dViola bit her lips without realizing it.It felt as if a giant serpent was looking into her mind, and Viola wanted to fall in an instant.As expected, this is a fantasy world. A place where people can faint from eye contact. A world of living, mana, and magic.\u2018Don\u2019t let your momentum slip.\u2019I swallowed the nervousness in my heart out. If I fail now, I\u2019m done for.\u201cYes, the Duke of Verratoux is a wild beast.\u201d\u201cYou have a good understanding.\u201dThe lips of the Duchess of Isabella drew a smirk.\u201cIs it because you are from a poor family? You look like you are quick-witted.\u201dShe sighed as she looked at Vixen, who had fallen to the ground.\u201cMy son is nice, but he\u2019s not spiteful. Because he is born into a noble family and grew up like a greenhouse plant.\u201dBeing from a poor family with an unknown descent, she would likely say, \u201cDon\u2019t hang out with my noble son\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was strange, and she felt glad.Duchess Isabella sat on the chair.\u201cVixen, you\u2019re brave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShortly after the whipping was over, Vixen sat on with his knees.\u201cFinally, did you eat to your heart\u2019s content?\u201dDuchess Isabella looked at her palm. Blood had formed. It was stinging and bitter, but it was tolerable.Vixen finally seemed a little more mature.Isabella laughed with satisfaction. \u201cVixen, you are the child that should act like a lion.\u201d\u2018In the distant future, you have to eat me. That way, you can be reborn as the true ruler of Verratoux.\u2019\u201cI have to be more severe than I am now.\u201d\u201cOkay. Can I get up then?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAs Vixen rose from his seat, Duchess Isabella smiled benevolently and said.\u201cYou can wear clothes.\u201d\u201cClothes?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s it for today\u2019s discipline.\u201dVixen thought for a moment. \u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dVixen looked at the clock on the wall.The clock is a product of magic tricks. It is a precision clock that does not allow an error of even one-tenth of a second.He didn\u2019t care about the fact that it was a work of a sorcerer, who is called the masterpiece of the present era. Vixen only observed the movement of the second hand.\u201cMother should go to bed now.\u201dIt\u2019s already one a.m.He started getting punished at ten p.m., so she had been whipping him for about three hours.Duchess Isabella felt strange again. Vixen has never done this before.\u2018Vixen is right and wanted to be with me.\u2019Vixen loved his strange mother, Duchess Isabella, even if he gets hit by a whip.He still wants to be together with her even more, but she supposed things changed.Duchess Isabella noticed something.\u201cAre you waiting for someone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVixen laughed. Duchess Isabella\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled. This was because she saw Vixen\u2019s expression turning bright.\u201cWho\u2019s my son waiting for? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your brother or sister.\u201dShe didn\u2019t think he would be. Then, there is only one person left.The youngest daughter, who is particularly interested in Vixen these days. It looks like it is Viola, the adopted daughter that the duke brought from the slums.\u2018Viola?\u2019Duchess Isabella smiled faintly.\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for your youngest sister, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dVixen thought for a moment. \u2018Can I be honest with my mother? Nothing would happen if I don\u2019t, but it felt strange if I did.\u2019Although thinking about it, there is no reason to lie at all. Vixen, who had been agonizing for a while, replied.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s Viola.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun to play with her.\u201dIsabella roughly listened to what Xenon saw and posted.\u2018There is also instinctive desire and ambition for the absolute.\u2019\u2018She has the madness that Verratoux must have.\u2019\u2018We also have reason to control that madness.\u2019Along with her mana\u2019s quality, he also said that her talent for killing is beyond imagination.\u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a great kid.\u2019The Duke admitted it and brought her here, so she must be a brilliant kid.\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that she\u2019s a great kid. So, what should we do with her, my son?\u201d\u201cI have to kill her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dDuchess Isabella approached Vixen. She hugged Vixen, who was covered with wounds, and swept away Vixen\u2019s golden hair.\u201cWhat are we going to do to our competitors?\u201dVixen smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019m going to tear them down!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dVixen is in the arms of Duchess Isabella. He looked up.\u201cMother.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to hug you.\u201dHehehe. The Smiling Vixen lost his balance.\u201cStill, you shouldn\u2019t let your guard down, son.\u201d Duchess Isabella took two steps away from Vixen.Vixen fell flat to the ground. His pupils drooped down.\u201cIf I were your competitor, you\u2019d be dead. The scariest enemy is the one you gave your heart to. You can\u2019t give your heart to anyone.\u201dDuchess Isabella reached out her hand.The butler of Vixen, who was waiting behind Vixen, held out a white cloth. Duchess Isabella wiped her nails with the white cloth. The white fabric was dyed black from poison.\u201cIt\u2019s discipline.\u201dDuchess Isabella looked down at the fallen Vixen.\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down. Always hold a poison in your heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, mother. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cMy heart aches so much whenever you do something wrong.\u201dVixen then lost his consciousness. Duchess Isabella roughly rubbed her eyes with a poisoned cloth. Her eyes reddened, and tears of blood began to flow down.Her eyes were very sore.This was a punishment for herself.Punishment for failing to raise Vixen to be strong enough.She stared blankly at Vixen, who had lost his consciousness.\u201cThis mother is a person who has the duty and responsibility to raise you strong.\u201dIf she wants to raise her son to be stronger, she needs to do more every day.She thought it was a mother\u2019s great love.***\u201cSince I am from a poor family and he is from heaven, you\u2019re noble enough to say, \u2018Don\u2019t hang out with my noble son\u2019.\u201dXenon almost burst into laughter without realizing it.\u2018As expected, of my Princess.\u2019He didn\u2019t expect her to respond like that.Xenon couldn\u2019t believe that Viola would say such rude things to the face of Duchess Isabella, who was frowning.Duchess Isabella laughed out loud. \u201cDid I sound like that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you thought of me like that, though it wasn\u2019t accurate.\u201dDuchess Isabella continued casually.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to look good to you. I meant to give you a white flower.\u201dWhite chrysanthemum flowers.It was the flower that Tundra placed in front of his father\u2019s grave.A white flower that means death. In other words, it was a warning of death.\u201cDid you understand? I don\u2019t think I could fall asleep with flowers in a place where lowly people live.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not vulgar. I\u2019m just a poor person.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what it is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different. You can be poor but precious. Same as you can be rich, but also vulgar.\u201d\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s good. Do poor people fall asleep with flowers?\u201d\u201cPoor people also pay tribute to death.\u201dJust like Tundra did.\u201cYou\u2019re extraordinary for your nature.\u201d\u201cI understand your thoughts in reminding yourself to the dead people. The Duchess must have thought that a flower is only for luxury reasons.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe may be poor, but at least we don\u2019t do that to our children.\u201dArin is a little angry.She wanted to have a family. Everyone else has a mom and dad. She wanted it, too.It was tough and lonely because there are not many people who do not have that. Family meant a lot to her. It was more valuable than precious jewels, which she could not have even if she wanted to.Isabella laughed out loud.\u201cThe way a mother loves her son, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a right for others to argue.\u201d\u201cIs he just an object?\u201dViola approached Vixen, who was too small to handle the bitter wounds.\u201cWe have become siblings, Mother.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t cross the line, my daughter.\u201d\u201cI think you crossed the line.\u201dViola squatted down. Before she knew it, Vixen came to his senses.Her voice could be vaguely heard.\u201cIn winter, every child under ten deserves protection. If my mother, one of the winter hostesses, breaks the absolute law, I don\u2019t know what the lower ones would think.\u201d\u201cDisciplining him is fine.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see if it\u2019s really okay.\u201dViola glanced back. \u201cXenon. Magic Registration Tool. You have it, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I have it, Princess.\u201d\u201cShoot it.\u201dAt that moment, Duchess Isabella\u2019s body moved. She went past Viola and grabbed Xenon\u2019s neck.Viola screamed internally at that moment. \u2018W-why is she so fast?\u2019It was like she melted her shadow and moved. Although I knew it through text, it was terrible to see it with both eyes. The real power of this family was Duchess Isabella.Gulp.I swallowed my saliva.This is crazy. If I do something wrong, I think Xenon\u2019s throat will get really damaged.Isabella\u2019s fingernails dug into Xenon\u2019s neck. \u201cStop right there, butler Xenon.\u201dA few drops of blood flowed from Xenon\u2019s neck.But Xenon only smiled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 I only take orders from the princess.\u201dHe took out a magic camera tool with his right hand, which looked similar to a modern camera.Viola smiled leisurely.\u201cYou know very well this is wrong. But still, you are so desperate to stop me.\u201dXenon asked. \u201cShall we take a picture? Though\u2026I think my neck is going to be pierced. It\u2019s bleeding right now.\u201d\u201cNo, thanks. I can\u2019t lose my butler.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dXenon put the filming tool in the corner.When Duchess Isabella released Xenon\u2019s neck, he took out the cloth from his front pocket and wiped his neck. He wiped off his sweaty forehead naturally.\u201cPhew, I almost died.\u201dIsabella said. \u201cOur youngest daughter has a cute side. At the welcome dinner, you will be worth seeing.\u201dViola held the end of the skirt and lowered her back.\u201cThank you for your early welcome, Mother.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t even think about filming in the first place.It was just a decoy.There was something else I was aiming for.\u201cHowever, what should I do? Vixen knew it was wrong.\u201dVixen\u2019s body was wriggling.In other words, he has come to his senses. Even if he can\u2019t raise his body, he must have heard everything.\u201cRight, brother?\u201dI heard a groan.I guess I touched where it hurts.\u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll put some ointment on you.\u201dAs if he understood my words, Vixen\u2019s body shook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll put some ointment on you.\u201dDuchess Isabella looked at Vixen and Viola alternately for a while. Her eyes were not very emotional. Then, she moved her eyes to Xenon.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting, Xenon.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dDuchess Isabella smiled faintly.\u201cXenon, as a butler, are you determined to serve the Sixth Princess?\u201d\u201cDepart from my heart, that\u2019s my job.\u201dDuchess Isabella nodded and went outside.\u201cXenon, ointment.\u201d\u201cHere you go, Princess.\u201dViola began to slowly apply ointment to Vixen\u2019s back.\u201cYou\u2019ve been beaten up bad.\u201dThis cannot be expressed in the words of love since it\u2019s not really love.\u201cThat\u2019s so mean.\u201dHow can a mother do this to her son?\u201cOw, it stings!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t whine.\u201dWhiplash doesn\u2019t hurt, but I see that it stings when I put on ointment for you, Vixen. Though I couldn\u2019t really understand because I\u2019m upset about everything.Viola carefully applied all the ointment.Click, click.She heard the sound of the clock ticking.There was a moment of silence.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, Viola.\u201d\u201cI think I should have been the one who knocks you down, too.\u201dAnd the opposite was fine too.\u201cIf I get hit by someone, I think I\u2019d better get hit by you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just, I feel that way.\u201dArin, who was a reader, understood Vixen\u2019s words.It was Vixen\u2019s own way of showing affection. His idea of affection was too brutal, but she understood it anyway.Viola\u2019s eyes met with Vixen. He was smiling innocently.\u201cSo, can\u2019t you just die, Viola? I\u2019ll kill you for sure. Hehehe.\u201dThere was affection in his voice. However, Vixen himself is not aware of this affection. Viola felt like she seriously screwed up somehow.\u2018It was heartbreaking and frustrating, but I had to do what I had to do.\u2019\u201cStop talking.\u201dShe said with a dull expression, controlling her innermost thoughts.\u201cLie down.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll put you to sleep.\u201dVixen tilted his head.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cOppa, you can\u2019t sleep, isn\u2019t that right?\u201dSince she was possessed into this crazy world anyway, Viola decided to use all of her information as a reader.\u201cHow did you know I couldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cThey say that insomnia runs in our family.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Vixen opened her eyes round.He looked at Xenon. It was as though he was asking, \u201cIs that really so?\u201dI felt nervous, not confident if Xenon would understand what he must do.Xenon grinned.\u201cYou are famous among butlers, master.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Vixen nodded.\u201cThough, how would you put me to sleep?\u201dHe looked curious.\u201cAre you going to use sleeping poison?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen, a general anesthetic?\u201d\u201cLie down for now.\u201dViola grabbed him by the wrist and forced him to lay down. Vixen did not particularly rebel. He was just laughing out loud. The back of her neck is filled with cold sweats, and her anxiety is overwhelming.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201dVixen was watching Viola\u2019s wrist with curious eyes.\u2018Her wrist is too thin.\u2019He thought it would break if she put too much pressure on it. Seeing her wrist, which is much thinner than average seven-year-old children of her age, Vixen was annoyed.The laughter disappeared.\u201cI just thought about how it would be most effective to cut your arteries.\u201dVixen didn\u2019t know why, but he felt terrible. Why is she so small? \u2018You\u2019re only a year older than me! That\u2019s very annoying. Eat a lot.\u2019He was so angry that he couldn\u2019t lay still.Regardless, Viola put him to bed. Thanks to the magic ointment, the blood stopped, and new flesh began to grow.Viola sat down next to Vixen, who was lying down. She patted the head of the child, who must have been in pain.Pat, pat.An indifferent touch swept through Vixen\u2019s hair.At this moment, it wasn\u2019t the seven-year-old Viola, but Arin who did that. She knew the novel\u2019s story too well.She whispered quietly on purpose.\u201cYou can\u2019t relax. I might get rid of you now. Open your eyes.\u201dVixen tried to open his eyes but failed.\u201cBut I\u2019m sleepy.\u201d\u201cIf you sleep, you\u2019ll die, Vixen.\u201dViola rolled up her lips and laughed.She slowly lowered her hand, which was patting his head, and grabbed his neck slightly.Grab.Surprisingly, Vixen fell asleep.He was actually afraid of the night because at night Duchess Isabella would leave him. She would put him to sleep this way since Vixen began to talk.\u201cIf you sleep, you\u2019ll die, son.\u201dDuchess Isabella wrapped her arms around Vixen\u2019s neck, as if she\u2019s strangling him.So, Vixen had to try hard not to sleep. Ever since he started walking around, he had to fight to stay awake.Duchess Isabella whispered in Vixen\u2019s ear.\u201cDon\u2019t relax. The enemy will kill you, Vixen.\u201dConsequently, Vixen has been trained like this since he was young. He tried his hardest to endure, then fell asleep when he could no longer bear it.That was how it went for many years.When Duchess Isabella no longer visited at night, he began to fear the night. His mother, who was with him every night, is no longer around anymore. From then on, Vixen\u2019s insomnia began.I looked down at Vixen, who fell asleep.\u201cThe way he sleeps is so adorable.\u201dI could see the plump cheeks from the baby fat. While lying on the side, his cheeks sprained out.Aside from his appetite, sleeping in the comfort of the world, he looked cute. His hair was all tangled up and even looked sloppy.He\u2019s so cute when he sleeps, though he\u2019s emotionally unstable. However, it would be even stranger to grow properly in this environment.She had mixed emotions. It seemed that Korean nursery schools were better than the rich duchy.Viola slowly rose from her seat.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t go.\u201d Vixen grabbed Viola\u2019s finger.\u2018Sleep talking?\u2019He spoke while he was still asleep. He is in such a deep sleep, but what is this strength?A drop of tears fell from Vixen\u2019s eyes again. His body trembled once, and he cried, \u201cNo, no.\u201dIt felt as though he was dreaming. Vixen mumbled in tears.\u201cPlease stay with me.\u201dI\u2019m not certain what he\u2019s dreaming about, but he must be having a nightmare. Vixen barely fell asleep after suffering from insomnia, so it must be quite difficult to sleep\u2026Tears fell from his tightly locked eyes.\u201cI\u2019m all alone.\u201dEventually, Viola sat down by Vixen\u2019s bedside. She looked down at Vixen\u2019s face, who had been asleep for a while.He looks pretty and pitiful.She stretched out her finger and wiped away his tears. She doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s dreaming, but Vixen was smiling faintly now.How long has it been?His eyelids were tightly shut, so Viola prepared to get up, but she got pulled onto his. She then fell asleep on his chest.Viola\u2019s purple hair covered Vixen\u2019s wound-filled body.That day, Vixen didn\u2019t have a nightmare after a long time.***It was 3:30 A.M.Xenon scratched his head.\u201cI can\u2019t wake her up, can I?\u201dHe carefully picked up Viola and walked down the hall.Viola was deeply asleep, so Xenon brought her back to her room. He covered Viola with a blanket. Just then, she opened her eyes.Xenon didn\u2019t miss the opportunity.\u201cPrincess, may I ask you a question? I\u2019d like to put you to sleep, but tomorrow is the day to report.\u201dViola answered half-asleep.\u201cWhat? A-at this hour? It\u2019s 3:30 A.M.?\u201dXenon smiled awkwardly. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll ask quickly.\u201d\u201cUhhh.\u201dViola nodded once. She was very sleepy. This seven-year-old\u2019s body is very vulnerable to sleep.\u201cYour acting was excellent.\u201dFor a moment, she came to her senses.It seemed as though he had noticed something.It was natural since he has good eyes. That fact was also expressed in the novel. Xenon was a butler who was very helpful to Viola since he is excellent in many skills and sharp.Now, that sharpness is shining brightly.Did she get caught? Pretending to be a wicked woman. Acting cruel and charismatic.It occurred to her that all of the \u2018reports\u2019 might have been read by Xenon.\u201cI\u2019ve seen the true image of the Duchess.\u201dViola didn\u2019t answer and just listened. She was scared.He must have read all of that about Duchess Isabella.\u2018What should I say?\u2019Don\u2019t get caught. The butler, Xenon, serves only competent people. It was mentioned several times in the novel. So, if Viola weren\u2019t competent, he\u2019d kill her himself.Though it sounds like a joke, it isn\u2019t.\u201cYou have a thirst in your blood, huh?\u201d\u201cThe way you looked when you hugged your dog.\u201dFor a moment, Viola felt the chills. All the windows were closed, yet she could feel the cold wind swept through.\u201cMe?\u201dXenon asked again.\u201cWhy are you acting so warm?\u201dHe has now grasped the situation.He realized that she was wearing a mask, pretending to be warm purposely. Xenon then took out a notebook and a pen and kept writing something. It looks organized with the contents of the report to be posted to the duke.\u201cHeartwarming and benevolent, and had an instinctive murderous look. She\u2019s wearing a mask. Sometimes, she even shows a slightly feisty expression in front of Duchess Isabella.\u201dXenon is definitely sharp.Arin is not the real Viola, so it was natural for her to get surprised and get intimidated sometimes. She\u2019s afraid of pretending to be alright on the outside.Xenon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cAlthough, that can\u2019t be true. You, who had those eyes, should never shrink. Even if your opponent is Duchess Isabella.\u201dHe continued. \u201cSo, the princess was a little intimidated in front of Duchess Isabella, isn\u2019t she? Your actions were perfect.\u201d\u2018No. I tried to hide my fear. I was so desperate.\u2019For Xenon, who has such a good eye, he only saw so little.\u201cThen, can I ask you why? Why did you act that way?\u201dHe smiled again.\u201cOh, it\u2019s not a test. It\u2019s for the Duke.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Viola opened her mouth.However, there was a situation that neither Viola herself nor Xenon had expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her body is very vulnerable to basic human needs.Eat, eat, sleep, and eat. Stomach bath. Sleep bath. She was especially weak on these three things. Viola couldn\u2019t stand it if she was too sleepy, if there were something delicious, or if she had to go to bed. At those times, the body would react on its own regardless of her will. Just like now.Viola fell asleep. As breaths and breaths crossed, her chest slowly went up and down.Xenon glanced at the figure.\u201cOh, my God.\u201dHe scratched the back of his head.\u201cWas it rude for me to ask that?\u201dXenon bowed down calmly and covered the blanket with delicate touches.Several purple hairs entered Viola\u2019s mouth. Maybe it\u2019s a dream, but Viola was chewing her hair so he pulled out her hair slightly.His hand brushed past her plumpy cheeks.Viola tossed and turned, feeling itchy.\u201cYou look cute sleeping.\u201dThe princess, who is exceptionally Verratoux-like, seemed no different from other children when she was sleeping.He was serious. \u2018She\u2019s seriously cute.\u2019She is much smaller than seven years of her age. Even if someone told him that she was five years old, he would believe it.When he looked at her, she was sleeping with her eyes slightly open.Xenon closed Viola\u2019s eyelids that had a much more friendly and careful touch than when she covered them.He raised his back.\u201cOops.\u201dHe thought she was cute when he saw Viola, but the process he had to go through was not so cute.Viola was testing him. So, Xenon had to be on alert.\u201cShe is the child who can handle mana like that, there\u2019s no way she couldn\u2019t sleep properly by herself, right?\u201dHe\u2019d seen her deal with mana personally.When she had thrown a git pen at Vixen.When she overpowered Tundra in an instant.When she slapped him on his cheek.Mana is the product of this era that gives superhuman strength. It is very commonly mistaken that a person who treated mana like that would not be able to sleep easily\u2026\u2018You\u2019re doing it on purpose, aren\u2019t you?\u2019This was a test for him, Xenon, the butler.Take care of yourself.It is also a way of indirectly showing that reporting to the Duke is not so important to her. It was very much a Verratoux-like way.\u2018This report\u2026 I\u2019ll post it on my own.\u2019Xenon grinned and turned off the magic light.Just in case Viola might wake up, he came out slowly without creating any sound. The smile didn\u2019t disappear from Xenon\u2019s mouth.Xenon, who closed the door silently, said quietly.\u201cI\u2019ll pass the exam, princess.\u201dIt is a strange test with no one asking questions and only acknowledged by those who are determined to solve them.***It was 5 A.M.It was the time when Duke Heron Verratoux usually woke up.As usual, Heron lifted himself from the bed.He always fell asleep alone after losing his first wife, \u2018Rael,\u2019 whom he truly loved. Heron had two more wives to succeed in this house, but he had never slept with them except when he succeeded the dukedom.As usual, it was Carlton, the general butler, who welcomed him in the morning.\u201cI\u2019ll get you a shower gown and a warm tea.\u201dDuke Heron lived like a machine. He got up at five. Around that time, Carlton came to the duke\u2019s bed and waited.Duke Heron took a shower for precisely fifteen minutes, then he would get out of the shower. He wore a white shower gown that Carlton gave him. Between the open shower gowns, his chest muscles, as though they were carved with a piece of knife, and shading abs were seen.The butler Carlton approached the Duke of Heron.He opened his shower gown with his hand in white gloves. Next, he would take out the strap on the back and tie the ribbon in front of the gown. The Duke\u2019s smooth body is covered by a shower gown.\u201cIf Mrs. Rael were alive, she wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d\u201cShe always told you every time you came out of the shower. She would be worried if you might catch a cold.\u201dDuke Heron nodded his head with an expressionless face.Rael always did.\u2018You. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u2019\u2018I won\u2019t get a cold.\u2019Duke Heron\u2019s body contains strong mana. This mana protects his body.e wouldn\u2019t catch a cold and wouldn\u2019t get sick, but he was rather worried about Rael. He liked it when Rael approached him first and took care of him, so he purposely unwrapped his shower gown every time.\u2018I\u2019ve told you many times that I wouldn\u2019t want you to get sick. Are you not going to listen to me at all?\u2019\u2018Then, why don\u2019t you do this all the time?\u2019The word was actually Duke Heron\u2019s wish. Rael also wanted to stay next to him.\u2018Don\u2019t die. Be the only one in my life. I loved you with all my heart and body.\u2019So, he said that on purpose. \u2018It is your responsibility to take care of my health. Never forget your duty.\u2019What he truly meant, was, please don\u2019t die and don\u2019t leave him behind.From the first time he met Rael, he knew she has a limited lifespan. Even the priests of the temple had incurable diseases.Still, Heron loved Rael. She was everything in his life.\u2018You should know how to do this on your own.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m busy. I don\u2019t have time to worry about something so trivial.\u2019 He intentionally exposed his shower gown even more.It has become a habit now. This habit was also the duke\u2019s way of reminiscing about Rael.\u201cLet me tell you about today\u2019s schedule.\u201dBut he had a special schedule today.\u201cTwenty-five minutes ago, Xenon said he\u2019d tell it to you face-to-face. He\u2019s waiting outside right now. It was about the Sixth Princess\u201d***Duke Heron heard Xenon\u2019s report over tea. Upon hearing the report, Heron smiled faintly.\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting report.\u201dThe particularly interesting part was that Isabella and Viola met.\u201cSo, Isabella\u2019s on the lookout.\u201dThe Duke does not love Duchess Isabella. However, he acknowledges her ability as a hostess. Duchess Isabella is a must for the duke. Though she is wary of Viola, who is only seven years old.Xenon said with difficulty.\u201cI didn\u2019t even say she was on guard, Duke.\u201d\u201cIsabella tells me most events in the family.\u201dThe same goes for the opposite. Duke Heron discusses many things with Isabella. The two are political marriages that help each other according to their interests.\u201cThough she didn\u2019t say anything about Viola.\u201dThat means she doesn\u2019t want to tell the Duke about Viola. It could be interpreted that she was on guard.Carlton, who was standing next to him, carefully asked back.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth talking about, but isn\u2019t it because you are challenging her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Xenon said.\u201dCarlton glanced at the duke in his chair. \u2018It\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve had someone you\u2019re interested in.\u2019Fifteen years have passed since the death of Duchess Rael. The duke lost his emotions. He just buried himself in his work and ran forward like a man chased by something.Thus, the current Duke of Verratoux is completed.A man who can be a king himself, but not whole. He became Heron Verratoux, the greatest monarch who is protecting the Winter Castle.Heron asked. \u201cWhen is the reception dinner?\u201d\u201cThree days from now.\u201d\u201cWhat events do I have before that?\u201d\u201cTomorrow, from 3 P.M. to 5 P.M. After that, your schedule is empty.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dDuke Heron decided to meet his adopted daughter.\u201cShe\u2019s extremely Verratoux-like, but it\u2019s as if she\u2019s an advanced Verratoux.\u201dAdvanced Verratoux is a bad word to hear at first glance. Now, Verratoux is in line with the word \u2018Stagnant Verratoux.\u2019\u201cShe\u2019s a seven-year-old adoptive daughter who knows how to wear a mask and use her partner. You won\u2019t regret it when you meet her.\u201d\u201cMy time is expensive, Xenon.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s time is gold. If you take that time away for nothing, it is a greater sin than robbing of gold. Xenon is very aware of that fact.\u201cYou must be confident that you even asked for a face-to-face report.\u201d\u201cYes, the princess gave me a test.\u201d\u201cA princess tests you.\u201d Duke Heron smiled faintly.Butlers always doubt the qualities of their successors. If the successors don\u2019t grow properly, the butlers are culled. Therefore, he always doubts and tests his successors. That\u2019s how butlers survive. On the contrary, a Verratoux, who tests butler, appeared.Xenon grinned.\u201cIf the meeting with the Duke takes place, I think I\u2019ll get some points from the Princess. Though, of course, you\u2019re not very satisfied with the meeting\u2026\u201d He scratched his head.\u201cHowever\u2026 you\u2019re not gonna kill me, are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at 3 P.M. tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dXenon bent down and paused.\u201cOh, I have one more thing to tell you. It\u2019s not a formal report, but\u2026 it\u2019s not from Xenon, the Butler. It\u2019s what Xenon, a human wants to say personally.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201dCarlton also listened.Xenon was brought by Heron himself. He\u2019d never seen him put his personal opinions.\u201cPrincess Viola is actually cute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe thought of her sleeping soundly while chewing her hair.\u2018That was cute.\u2019\u201cCute. It\u2019s not Verratoux-like, but more Verratoux-like than anyone else. It\u2019s a wonderful sense.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a useless feeling.\u201dCarlton, who listened carefully, is also a little disappointed.What do you mean by cuteness to Verratoux, who will grow up to be armed with the charisma of a monarch?\u2018What a useless virtue.\u2019He could see why it is not put in official reports.A cute Verratoux, what would you use it for? Cuteness is not an essential virtue for Verratoux.Just then, Heron changed the subject.\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow at three.\u201dIt\u2019s been a long day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both have beautiful jewelry and accessories, and both are full of brilliant lace.Though, of course, it wasn\u2019t Viola\u2019s taste.\u2018It would\u2019ve been nice if I have a cute character.\u2019I think the sweet world of Romance Fantasy, which is loved by dad and brother, would\u2019ve been better.I\u2019m screwed. There is no such thing as cuteness here.Viola looked at her face several times in the mirror. There is no one who would potentially think she looked so good with the villainess\u2019 behavior. \u2018I didn\u2019t think this body, which mysteriously emits an aura of murderous ears, would be considered cute.\u2019\u201cNot so good.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my mistake.\u201dXenon took out his notebook and took notes.\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d\u201cI am writing about how the princess hated dresses.\u201dAnyway, this place is a fantasy world, and it is natural for a Young Lady to wear a dress. Still, there were dresses that were easily worn and moved around that I liked.\u201cThis should do it.\u201dAmong the dresses full of closets, she chose clothes that were less designed and the simplest.In the meantime, Viola was constantly suspicious and wary.\u201cSudden date?\u201dXenon asked for a date. It is said that there is a place in Winter Castle that sells very delicious Egg Tarts. It has only one menu. People would come here from the southern trip just to purchase these eat egg tarts.Actually, Viola knew. The tart is also a Winter territory specialty.\u2018He must have a plan, right?\u2019 I\u2019m sure there is. Though I don\u2019t know what it is. So, I couldn\u2019t relax, but still, I want to eat it.Viola\u2019s seven-year-old body was unable to beat the gluttony of twenty-one-year-old Arin. Han Arin, twenty-one, is originally a gluttonous person. It was kind of traumatic for her not to be able to eat delicious things as a child. So, after turning twenty, she ate everything she wanted to eat. Sometimes she even got an upset stomach because of it and had to take digestive medicine.The twenty-one-year-old spirit that in me would not endure the gluttony of the seven-year-old. And it is egg tarts we are talking about!Twenty-one years old. There was a gap between the body and the mind, and the body strongly wanted to indulge in egg tarts.My appetite grew wiggly. \u2018It\u2019s an irresistible date offer!\u2019Xenon, in white gloves, pushed out his hand towards Viola, who was wearing a white dress.\u201cI\u2019ll escort you, Princess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn the novel, it was described as a heavenly taste. Sprinkle cinnamon on freshly baked nooran egg tarts.\u300c Take a bite of the hot egg tart. \u300dThis is the rough description.\u201cFor a moment, a warm, fluffy feeling fills the mouth, and that dreamy sweetness travels through the blood vessels of the body to the tip of the toes\u2026\u201dWith the plan of having an Egg tart restaurant date with Xenon, they then headed to Azulezia.***As expected, egg tart is popular.\u2018Wow, this looks so good!\u2019There is a deep sense of happiness filled in my heart. At this moment, I thought I would have no regrets even if I ate this and died. The expression that my sweet inner sound is transmitted from mouth to toe was not false after all.\u2018Yeah! This is life!\u2019It was the first happiness I felt since I have transmigrated here. \u2018I\u2019m glad I possessed this body,\u2019 this was the first time I left this way.Though, everyone in the bakery stood up.\u2018Huh?\u2019It suddenly became solemn. People put their right hand on their chest. It looked like a salute to the national flag, which was a way of paying respect.It was the honorable duke.Heron Verratoux walked in. They all lowered the egg tarts in their hands and bowed their head carefully.People in Winter Castle fear Heron Verratoux, but they have awe-inspiring admiration in their eyes. They have fear of those who acknowledge the glory they had, but they did not feel fear. It\u2019s just filled with reverent respect unto him.And the people of the winter castle did feel that.Their eyes were filled with awe. Fear and respect for the great monarch of the winter castle were mixed together. They kept their right hands on their chests in shock and bowed their heads towards the owner of the Winter Castle.The surroundings became quiet.No one dared to eat egg tarts in front of the honorable Duke. The least they can do is give their courtesy and respect to the monarch. However, there was the only one who did not show courtesy and respect.Wow!Someone chewed egg tart.It was so quiet around that the sound was even louder.***Viola was embarrassed.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019 I had to get up, but I couldn\u2019t move.The only thing that moves is the hands and mouth towards Egg Tart.\u2018I need to move.\u2019Viola must have been in a hurry, so she put one whole piece in her mouth. Her cheeks were full and sloppy cream in the egg tart was filled near her lips.Munch. I tasted sweet bliss. For about two seconds, Viola experienced heaven.\u2018Oh\u2026My God\u2026\u2019And heaven was short. It was only two-second heaven. The stark atmosphere caught her eyes.\u2018I\u2019m in trouble.\u2019 My body was stiff.Everyone else is up and taking a bow, and I\u2019m the only one who ate egg tart. So, I tried to chew hurriedly, though the sound was awfully loud. Viola could feel the eyes of Duke Heron and the crowd.\u2018Oh, this is, I know. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to be rude\u2026\u2019 I felt like crying.Everyone was looking her way.Some of them looked at her side, while the others\u2019 faces were filled with astonishment. A child who sits calmly in the presence of the lord of winter and savors egg tarts. \u2018How did you get your manners fixed?\u2019 They looked with that thought. Viola seriously wanted to cry.\u2018It\u2019s just that my body didn\u2019t listen to me\u2026\u2019This seven-year-old\u2019s body is very vulnerable to sleep, appetite, and bowel movements. This is one of those situations now\u2026So, it was even more so when there is a big gap between the spirit of twenty-one-year-old Han Arin and the body of seven-year-old Viola.Han Arin, who grew up in an orphanage, had a different appetite for \u2018sweet desserts.\u2019She knows how delicious egg tarts are, so her mind strongly wanted to consume those egg tarts. Therefore, the seven-year-old Viola\u2019s body failed to overcome the intense desire of the twenty-one-year-old spirit. Viola\u2019s body was gifted with a powerful killer aura but is not resistant to sweet desserts.Sigh. I don\u2019t know why Duke Heron appeared here.No wonder it\u2019s a grand date.No way\u2026I felt deceived by Xenon.\u2018If you wake up late and say good morning suddenly, it\u2019s rather contradicting.\u2019 I thought in my mind.He\u2019s my favorite! I know my favorite character the best, so I can fix this! I ate calmly and collected my breath.\u2018Pretending not to panic! I\u2019m pretending!\u2019Duke Heron moved, and he raised his hand slightly. Only then did the people sit down, they lowered their voices as low as they could and carefully continued their stories.Duke Heron sat in front of Viola. Viola lowered her head slightly.\u201cHow are you?\u201dThe expressionless Duke Heron caught my eye.Once again, there is a big gap between the spirit of twenty-one-year-old Han Arin and the body of seven-year-old Viola.\u2018He\u2019s so handsome.\u2019On the first day of my transmigration, I was out of my mind. So, I couldn\u2019t afford to appreciate that handsomeness properly, but now that I see him again, I can tell. There is no mistake with the contents of the novel.Many people dressed up to win the hearts of Heron. In the social world, the popularity of the sequel book, \u300c 101 ways to capture the heart of Heron Verratoux \u300d, soared to the point of skyrocket.Han Arin has met a lot of people and has seen a lot of good looks on TV and cell phones so she does feel the difference.\u2018Crazy beauty.\u2019He\u2019s not neat. He has loose black bangs. His sharp eyes that you see under the disheveled bangs. His black eyes, which had the immense energy of charisma, felt like it was spilling even beyond the color. Duke Heron\u2019s sharp jawline, which was even sharper than his nose, seemed to reveal his intense sensitivity.Is this how lily flowers with poisonous spines feel like?A flower that would kill you if you reach your hands out and touch it. Even though, regardless of knowing that fully well, you still end up reaching for it under the influence of its beauty.\u2018How can a man look like that?\u2019Viola slightly pinched her thighs. I know my father is handsome, but I must stay alert. The person right in front of me is the duke. It\u2019s Heron Verratoux. I almost looked at him as though I was a fangirl in the real world.\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201dI think I\u2019ve already seen it.\u201cIs it rude to look at my father\u2019s face?\u201dHonorifics or informal language? I thought about what to do, but I decided to use honorifics since there are so many people watching.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause you are too handsome to be a father, but you are a father already after all.\u201dCarlton, the butler, standing behind the Duke of Heron, handed over a document. Heron showed the document.\u201cAs of yesterday, you have become my adopted daughter on paper.\u201d\u201cShould I thank you?\u201dHeron Verratoux doesn\u2019t like obedient children. He likes predators who can find and eat their own food. \u2018I prefer running cats rather than shrieking lions. I should not feel scared.\u2019 And so, I made up my mind.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for you to express your gratitude?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dFor a moment, Heron Verratoux frowned slightly.\u201cWhy do you ask so many questions?\u201d\u201cI only did twice.\u201dDuke Heron shut his mouth.Viola held her shaky leg close. He has an expressionless face, but I did feel a great sense of pressure. It felt like \u2018Get up from your seat, swing your sword around your neck!\u2019It truly felt like he was going to cut my throat off.\u201cTwice is frequent enough.\u201dThat sounded like \u2018two cuts would be enough to cut your throat.\u2019Viola, like Han Ah-rin, who is a fan of Heron Verratoux, tried to overcome the situation. With a more relaxed, sober, and arrogant look on his face, I said, \u201cFather brought me here because he wanted something from me.\u201dI tried to continue, however, my body hardly listened to me. Today, Han Arin\u2019s appetite beat Viola\u2019s body.\u2018Stop it, hands! Bad hand!\u2019The hand began to move at will.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t bear the luxury of the egg tart somehow when I put my eyes on it. However, the problem was the spring breeze that flew through the window. In the spring breeze, the sweet scent of soft egg tarts permeated deeply. So, I unconsciously picked up the egg tart.Bite.All of a sudden, I put another one in my mouth.\u2018Oh, this is the taste!\u2019And after a second, I experienced hell. Even the butler, Carlton, was looking at Viola as if he was embarrassed. Xenon looked at Viola with a slightly worried look.It\u2019s not until this fluffy egg tart gets in your mouth. \u2018This isn\u2019t it.\u2019 I didn\u2019t expect my body to move like this. Viola picked up egg tarts with her two fingers, hiding her embarrassment.It happened, and I had to deal with the consequences\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll give you one.\u201dI handed one of it over to Duke Heron, and added.\u201cIt\u2019s very delicious.\u201d\u201cAre you giving me one?\u201d\u201cYes, especially for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a waste, I don\u2019t enjoy sweets.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d\u201cWhy would you give me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re my father now.\u201dHeron Verratoux raised his hand. Viola flinched for a moment and touched a poisoned dagger in her hand. His index finger touched Viola\u2019s cheek.Swoosh~As if to wipe off the dust, he wiped off Viola\u2019s cheek with indifferent touch.\u201cXenon, make sure you teach her manners. I\u2019ve never seen Verratoux with something on their face.\u201dHeron raised his finger. his finger was filled with cream. He wiped off the cream with a napkin and Duke Heron rose from his seat.\u201cOne question, Viola.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEveryone in winter pays respect to me, putting their right hand on their chest and lowering their head. Why didn\u2019t you do that?\u201dViola sat down and looked up at Duke Heron. I couldn\u2019t swallow egg tart completely. Thanks to it, my mouth was still busy.Munch.Luxury egg tarts melted in my mouth. I was sorry for its disappearance, so I rolled my tongue lightly and saved it. Viola, who had come to her senses to a certain extent, said.\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what father wants, I\u2019ll do the same.\u201dIn fact, Duke Heron Verratoux has never ordered such a thing. As a child, Heron Verratoux dreamed of a beautiful world, he once even dreamed of becoming a hero. However, the wall of reality was stiff.A beautiful and clean way alone could not make him the head of the winter castle.He had to kill many men and animals before he came to this position, and was given the title of Duke many years later. Eventually, he was able to get this high in the Winter Castle. He became the continent\u2019s strongest shield to protect mankind from the northern snow.People admired Heron, but were also afraid at the same time. The only person who was not afraid of Heron was Rael. She treated Heron as a human Heron, not as the Heavenly Duke Heron.\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d\u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019\u2018What you don\u2019t want, I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 In front of Rael, Heron could be the only human Heron.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you wanted it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what it looked like to you?\u201d\u201cYes, if you don\u2019t want to, then I won\u2019t.\u201dI gulped down the last egg tart left in my mouth. The Duke who had been looking at Viola for a long time and spoke again.\u201cIs all this a mask?\u201dFor a moment, I didn\u2019t understand. Although I didn\u2019t understand at first, I quickly understood what he meant later. No, it\u2019s not a mask, it\u2019s just my body moving at its own will.\u2018If I answer like that, I\u2019ll be in trouble, right?\u2019 A princess who can\u2019t keep her own body reception. In Duke Heron\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s unacceptable. Then, I thought it would be better to say no.For now, I remained silent. Like a silent affirmation.Xenon said, \u201cShe\u2019s a seven-year-old princess who knows how to control others in a mask.\u201d\u201cYou gave me a generous grade.\u201d\u201cWearing a mask is a good choice. In order to become a ruler, she has to be able to wear a lot of masks. Moreover, she is not pure blood.\u201d\u201cGood teaching. Thank you.\u201d\u201cBut the current mask is not good enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cVerratoux should act like Verratoux. Do you understand?\u201dHeron added, \u201cIt is not Verratoux\u2019s way of acting cute. She can\u2019t be cute. She can\u2019t rule the Verratoux\u2019s castle that way.\u201dViola stared at him and opened her mouth.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cI want you to be a real dad. I\u2019m not lying.\u201dHan Arin is a person who understood the character, Heron, well. He\u2019s very different from what he looks like on the outside. The current Duke Heron is the Duke Heron who is created and refined by the environment. He wasn\u2019t like that from the beginning.\u201cSo, treat me dearly.\u201dCarlton, who was still listening, suddenly felt relieved and almost collapsed.He\u2019d never heard such a grumpy remark in the decades of being in the service for the duke. She\u2019s asking him to cherish her. It doesn\u2019t suit Verratoux. What kind of Verratoux would say that?Still, he stepped forward.If he kills or cuts the princess now, there will be a terrible rumor in the duke\u2019s history.\u201cNot like Verratoux, Princess. Be careful what you say and do.\u201dThen, the princess will die. Carlton is genuinely worried about Viola. However, Han Arin\u2019s thoughts were completely different.\u201cOur fearsome favorite grows a cute hedgehog in secret in The Beast\u2019s coffin, which is enchanted by a seven-fold link.\u201d\u2018He doesn\u2019t know anyone!\u2019 The characters did not know, but only the readers knew. This content does not even appear in the novel.\u2018My duke is weak for cuteness.\u2019However, in the past, the author released a set book, and there is definitely content like this. This content is only available to readers of this novel, who searched the writer\u2019s blog and read the novel\u2019s set book about seventeen times.\u2018Of course\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u2019 Viola had no intention of acting cute. In the first place, this body is too far from cuteness. A natural-born killer dreamer who is born to be a star. She can\u2019t be cute when she\u2019s not even cute.So, I decided to give up on cuteness. I can never be cute. Instead of pretending to be cute, I have to take the emotional approach. I had to be good at tightrope walking. I can\u2019t ruin this. There is that mysterious line.\u2018There\u2019s a fine line of standards that only the real reader can see!\u2019It was a little disappointing. It would have been better if the character Viola was set to be cute. \u2018Okay, let\u2019s not think about useless things.\u2019Duke Heron turned his back on Viola while staring at him.\u201cSee you at the welcome dinner.\u201dViola held the hem of her skirt and bent down.\u201cGoodbye.\u201dAnd that\u2019s how the meeting between the father and daughter ended.***Inside the carriage going back to the Duke. The Duke looked out through the wagon window. Outside the window, children were playing with beads. Strangely today, that figure was especially embedded in his mind.\u201cCarlton.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201d\u201cIs that how fluffy a child\u2019s cheeks are?\u201d\u201cI tend to cut myself well even on dull days because I\u2019m thin. But he\u2019s recovering fast.\u201dCarlton is Duke Heron\u2019s closest aide. He thought he read Duke Heron\u2019s inner thoughts with confidence, but it was a relief.\u2018The Duke does not kill children under the age of ten in any case. So, you\u2019ll be safe for a while, Sixth Princess. However, please wake up. You need to show a more Verratoux-like appearance.\u2019 They all look messy like today. And the Duke doesn\u2019t like it at all. Carlton was certain of that.The Duke asked again.\u201cDo children usually eat with food on their mouths like that?\u201dCarlton became a little serious. The Duke must have been very disappointed. It seems that the five children born in Verratoux, that is a prestigious aristocrat, are so different from those who received formal etiquette education.\u2018I need to protect you.\u2019 So, he turned the arrow of responsibility to Xenon.\u201cXenon\u2019s still starting her manner\u2019s education.\u201dCarlton sighed inwardly. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s so cute. That can\u2019t happen. No, it shouldn\u2019t happen. The words Verratoux and cuteness are more opposite than the words water and oil.\u2018Xenon, you\u2019re going to get in trouble.\u2019 He praised her as such a great princess, but now Carlton thinks the duke is very disappointed.\u201cNot at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI just didn\u2019t behave well.\u201dStill, she is a child who has only been at the duke\u2019s residence for a few days. He already had a feeling it was a waste to throw her away. Once again, Carlton said it with a sincere heart.\u201cHowever, since she is very young and has only been a few days since she came to the winter castle, it is better to give her some more time. It hasn\u2019t been ten days since the Duke allowed her in.\u201dThe Duke lowered his gaze. He\u2019s done talking to Carlton. Though he thought, Carlton is right. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s not well capable yet, it\u2019s definitely like that. His eyes contained the finger that touched her plumpy cheek earlier.The feeling came to his mind.He wiped the cream with this hand. The sluppy cream was stuck on it. Heron also remembered her tenacious gaze towards the Egg Tarts. Viola is amazing.\u2018I\u2019ll give you one.\u2019\u2018Yes, specifically for you.\u2019\u2018Is that what you want?\u2019\u2018Is it all a mask?\u2018I\u2019m not lying about asking you to be a real father. So, treat me dearly.\u2019Heron smirked without realizing it.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u2026Huh?Watching the scene, Carlton wondered. However, he thought it was a relief. Heron didn\u2019t seem to intend to give up or kill the princess.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re in a bad mood, Duke.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a child wearing a mask and playing tricks on me.\u201dDuke Heron judged reasonably and thought rationally.The little girl is certainly wearing a mask now.He trusted Xenon\u2019s report. While hiding her madness thoroughly, she wore a mask that looked as though, \u2018I am a child who knows nothing.\u2019Heron smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s gross.\u201dCarlton began to sense something strange at that point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Played the Role of the Adopted Daughter Too WellChapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17After a while, Heron spoke again.\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny to squeeze a ruse out of that little head?\u201d\u201cWhen I was caught, I was impressed by the way you didn\u2019t do so, Duke.\u201dCarlton thought it was a little strange. \u2018He\u2019s not the one who repeats the same thing.\u2019 Today while he was talking to Viola, Heron seemed to repeat the same sentiment numerous times. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s disappointed with the youngest Princess.The duke continued.\u201cBut she has to change a little bit from now on.\u201dThe first time is a mistake. Nonetheless, mistakes should not be repeated. Now that he has taught her, the direction will have to change in the future. Verratoux should act like Verratoux. That\u2019s what Heron thought. However, he kept thinking about her peach-colored plump cheeks and creamy face. Carlton continued.\u201cSince you met her for the first time today, I think she\u2019ll show a different side at the welcoming dinner, more Verratoux like.\u201d\u201cShe should, or she\u2019ll be beheaded.\u201dThere seemed to be a feeling of doubt at the tip of his mind. Heron remembered her desire and her obsession with egg tarts, which was close to craziness and obsession. Viola was like a hedgehog looking for food. She had a disheveled appearance that was never seen in a pure-blooded Verratoux. Her purple hair was flowing down on her face and her plump cheeks with peach-colored cheeks.The laxity of eating with cream on cheeks and lips. Her crazy-like gaze towards the egg tart.A child who gives the egg tart out of her tenacity with noticeable regret. She was much smaller than seven years of her age, but strangely, Viola kept appearing in his mind.The Duke shook his head without anyone knowing and thought to himself several times. \u2018No. Verratoux should be like Verratoux.\u2019 It\u2019s as if he\u2019s chanting a spell. Heron kept denying what he had been pondering. He repeated it to himself.\u2018You\u2019re my father from now on.\u2019\u2018Treat me dearly.\u2019Her words kept ringing in his ears. He deliberately, forcefully, once again, thought vigorously. \u2018If she\u2019s not acting like a Verratoux, I\u2019ll behead her.\u2019Meanwhile, Viola returned to her room. She then laid down on the bed.\u2018Wow.\u2019Today\u2019s experience was exceptional. I think I\u2019ve been to heaven and hell dozens of times. \u2018Why was he there?\u2019 I don\u2019t know why Heron Verratoux came to Azulezia.Then, Viola fell asleep unknowingly. Thirty minutes later, I opened my eyes wide as though I had seen a ghost, shocked.When I opened my eyes, I saw Xenon\u2019s face.\u201cHow long have I slept?\u201d\u201cYou slept thirty minutes and twelve seconds.\u201dI guess Xenon has been next to me for a while. Whenever I open my eyes from my sleep these days, I would see him. It made me wonder if the butlers always stay together with their masters like this.I also felt that the time he was attached to me now, was as much as the time he was attached to the original Viola.\u2018It\u2019s probably just a feeling, isn\u2019t it?\u2019In the original story, such things as \u2018The Butler was attached for twenty-two hours, eleven minutes and ten seconds are not described. In fact, there is much more unexplained content than the novel had described.\u2018I\u2019m sure he was attached to Viola like this as well.\u2019Viola then said.\u201cGet me Tundra.\u201d***\u2018I need to check.\u2019A strange phenomenon occurs when Viola meets Tundra. When they make eye contact or touch each other for a while, she would get dizzy. Then, without realizing it, she lost her body to the real Viola.\u2018I need to know the baseline, so I can be more prepared.\u2019Tundra came in. His wounds were almost healed, but he still had restraining tools on the wrist and ankle.\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot better.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Viola nodded.She looked directly towards Tundra since she couldn\u2019t get used to his face. He looks exactly like Kang Han-Joon, her twelve-year-old brother, in her previous life.\u201cYou know why I have you called, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI do. You want me to be your hunting dog someday.\u201d\u201cRight. Come closer.\u201dViola went closer to Tundra. She couldn\u2019t ask him to do a staring contest or hug him all of a sudden. So, she decided to check in Viola\u2019s way.\u201cI need a dog. A well-trained and sharp-toothed hound.\u201dIn the original, Tundra learns the sword from Hixen, who is staying as a guest at the dukedom.\u201cWhat\u2019s your tool then?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of weapon are you good at?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201dTundra hesitated. Then, Viola took his hand.She had to check it. \u2018I think it\u2019s all right to hold it lightly.\u2019I didn\u2019t feel dizzy. So, it is okay to hold hands. Next, I touched his palm and fingers. There were a lot of calluses on the index and middle finger.\u2018It\u2019s still fine up to touch until here.\u2019Viola touched the shoulders and back of Tundra slightly. She felt his muscles. The muscle texture that Viola was touching with her finger shook like a live fish.\u201cYour shoulders and back muscles are quite developed, and you are wearing animal skins that are very crude.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Tundra felt his face burning.\u2018Strange.\u2019The twelve-year-old tundra felt a mysterious feeling. \u2018Do puppies who accept their owners\u2019 touch feel this way?\u2019 That was Tundra\u2019s thought.\u201cThe material is tough, and it can protect the skin, but it doesn\u2019t have a cooling function.\u201d\u201cThe south is warmer than here. Near your cabin, there is rough terrain.\u201dShe got to know him through physical contact. Viola thought it would be all right as long as they didn\u2019t hug each other.\u201cAnd you lived in such a poor place that you were attacked and helplessly kidnapped by such a poor band of bandits.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou and your father were mountain hunters.\u201dViola continued without hesitation. Anyway, it is a novel, so she knew everything.\u201cThe son of a hunter.\u201dViola moved her hand. She rubbed the callus of Tundra. \u2018Hmm. Is this okay?\u2019 She clasped her fingers tightly. Testing one thing or another, she continued as not to be suspicious.\u201cI would say you wanted the bow. That\u2019s probably why you have calluses in your index finger and middle finger, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. I learned how to bow.\u201dTundra bit his lips slightly.\u2018Odd.\u2019 This feeling is not unfamiliar. \u2018Why\u2026It felt like I have Viola somewhere. It can\u2019t be.\u2019 But strangely, he kept feeling strange.\u2018What is this\u2026this feeling.\u2019Viola\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI don\u2019t need a hound that doesn\u2019t even know what his own teeth are.\u201d Tundra looked puzzled.He couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. Of course, she was a novel reader, so it was something she knows very well.Hixen, who will be Tundra\u2019s teacher said, \u2018This bastard has exceptionally good fuselage vision and excellent reflexes at close distances. He was born with explosive physical abilities through momentary muscle contraction and relaxation.\u2019\u300c Above all, your body is specialized in \u2018dark.\u2019 You need to master the sword. \u300dSo, Viola said. \u201cYou should learn the sword, not the bow.\u201dOkay.Finished checking.Finger flick was all right.She had to understand it well. If she loses her body to Viola by mistake, She doesn\u2019t know what would happen.\u201cI\u2019ve never handled a sword before.\u201d\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have had a chance anyway.\u2019 It\u2019s an expensive weapon for a black hunter to handle. It also requires systematic training and costs a lot of money to train \u2018black.\u2019 Therefore, it is difficult to handle swords properly unless they are aristocrats.Viola whispered in the ear of Tundra.\u201cFor me, learn the sword.\u201dClank.She released the restraint on his wrist.Clank. Viola then let go of his other wrist.\u201cI need a hound who learns how to use a sword.\u201dClank, clank.Lastly, she even loosened the restraints on both ankles.\u201cI will introduce you to a great swordsman.\u201dI made brief eye contact with Tundra. Inside, I counted the numbers. \u2018One, two, three.\u2019 About three seconds was fine. She continued to experiment. However, after three seconds, she started to feel a little dizzy. \u2018This is still okay.\u2019Four seconds. Five seconds.\u2018Now I\u2019m at the limit, huh?\u2019Tundra avoided my eyes first. He lowered his eyes slightly, and his face was all red. What\u2019s wrong with him? Why is he feeling so shy? His face is really red. \u2018Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in puberty. Maybe because he\u2019s embarrassed.\u2019\u201cWell, my Lord.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cOriginally, don\u2019t aristocrats hesitate to touch a man\u2019s body?\u201dViola burst into laughter.\u201cA Man?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFor Viola, it is hard to see Tundra as a man. Although her body is seven years old, her mind is twenty-one years old. So, it is impossible for her to see a twelve-year-old child as a man.\u2018And now that I\u2019m aware of it\u2026\u2019 This kid can\u2019t even look at her eyes because his face is so hot. Tundra is tapping the ground with his toes. It\u2019s just so cute.The kid asked seriously.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not a man?\u201d\u201cYou are a dog.\u201d\u201cThen, I need a hand.\u201dHmm. What should she say to that serious expression of his? Sometimes he looked like a ferocious beast, but now he looked desperate for something.Is she saying that child is a child then?Viola put her hand on Tundra\u2019s head. She then rubbed it.Tundra didn\u2019t hate the touch. It was a comforting touch. Especially now that there\u2019s nothing left for you in this world.There was no one.And always a sense of loss in the corner of his heart, Tundra missed people\u2019s touch and voice.He opened his mouth. \u201cTo be a good man, I\u2019ll learn how to do it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI promise.\u201dTundra wanted to learn more about swords.\u201cIf I learn the sword diligently\u2026\u201dTundra\u2019s eyes turned to Viola\u2019s hand. He looked at that hand that was placed on his head earlier. \u2018Will she stroke me again like that? And will she admit me as a man?\u2019 He wished she could do that. He sincerely felt that way.\u201cMaster.\u201d Tundra knelt down.All of a sudden.Tundra kneeled in front of Viola and fell.\u201cI promise to brush my own teeth.\u201dOne day he\u2019ll be recognized as a man.He then kissed Viola\u2019s feet slightly.This was an action by slaves when they swore allegiance to their master, or when a debtor expressed extreme courtesy to their benefactor.Tundra, sleep with a reverent mind. God gave the best example that he could do. Viola almost kicked Tundra.\u2018Oh, it\u2019s gross!\u2019There is no such custom in Korea in the twenty-first century that is like this. So, she was not used to it. The feeling of being treated with respect is nothing but embarrassing. She was out all day today and wasn\u2019t able to wash up yet.\u2018What if my feet stink?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A silver platter is in Xenon\u2019s right hand.\u201cFood, toy dog.\u201d\u201cCall me Tundra.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dXenon grinned. He found a note on the desk.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dHe could see the letters. It was a letter from his companion.\u201cMy father always told me to dream. Dreams come true.\u201dHe always told Tundra to write letters and recite them. He taught him that his dreams would come true.\u201cWhat does that have to do with being a companion?\u201d\u201cDo you know what a noble dog is called these days?\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t know.\u201dBetween the slightly open windows, the night breeze blew hard.Sha. The cold wind blew, Tundra\u2019s bangs fluttered in the wind. Cold air landed on the floor, and the atmosphere sank heavily. Even if he\u2019s young, his atmosphere is different. Aura was like the primary source in this world.\u201cA pet.\u201d\u201cA pet dog?\u201d Tundra\u2019s eyes became serious.The male lead\u2019s high aspirations were revealed.\u201cYes, I\u2019m going to be a dog. That\u2019s my new dream.\u201dThat\u2019s how he had decided. He had to learn a lot about swords and get recognized as a companion. \u2018I think I can be a pet dog of my benefactor, Princess Viola.\u2019She told him that she would be next to him even when he had lost everything. Viola held his hand, trimmed his hair, and held out her hand to him. It felt as if a small ray of light had shone into the dark, where everything had disappeared.\u201cYour dream is to be a pet?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dA companion. It means living together in pairs. The word \u2018comfort\u2019 had set fire to Tundra\u2019s heart. Xenon nodded his head.\u201cThe princess\u2019s dog. That\u2019s a pretty good ambition.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cCongratulations on having a good dream, Tundra.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dXenon sincerely congratulated, and Tundra was sincerely congratulated.At the same time.Viola pulled up the blanket.\u201cSomething spooky is happening today.\u201d***The next day, Viola and Xenon headed to the annex of the duke\u2019s house.Xenon explained.\u201cThe Duke\u2019s annex has numerous guests.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dUsually, there are always annexes in large houses of this size, and there are many guests there. Guests are also divided according to the grand mansion\u2019s prestige. Those who can stay as guests of the Duke of Verratoux, most of them are unusual people. Grandmaster, master\u2019s descendant, outstanding knight, great wizard, etc.Among them, Hixen is an unusual character.Hixen, who is known to have been involved in a battle with Duke Verratoux as a child, was once revered as a hero.\u2018Now, he is a drunk-worn asshole.\u2019If Hixen were not the Duke\u2019s comrades, he would have been kicked out of the annex. Hixen happens to find Tundra, and teaches Tundra his own sword style. He was also a character with such an epic story that was saved due to teaching Tundra.\u201cPrincess, Sir Hixen, who you\u2019re looking for, is a great man and once called a hero\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. I saw it in the annex appendix you gave me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re well prepared. But why Sir Hixen?\u201dHey, that\u2019s how you do it in novels. But what about Tundra, who learned from Hixen, who has a tremendous genius and had rapid growth?\u2018I can\u2019t say that.\u2019Viola rolled up her lips and smirked.\u201cUntil my dog becomes a faithful hound. He can\u2019t be held in check.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s why Sir Hixen.\u201dHixen is the scumbag of the annex. He\u2019s just an old hero, but now he\u2019s a drunk man that no one is keeping in check. The dog of a princess who learns sword from a drunken man. It will be nothing more than gossip.\u201cBut his skills are real.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201dIn the novel.\u201cIn the slums.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dXenon knows. A few years ago, Lord Hixen was searching through the slums to find his lost daughter. So, perhaps Viola saw it then.\u2018Does that mean she had seen Lord Hixen\u2019s sword skill at that time?\u2019If Viola had read Xenon\u2019s mind, she would have answered in her mind. \u2018No. I read it in a novel.\u2019Anyway, Xenon thought. \u2018I have seen Lord Hixen\u2019s sword skill, and I remembered his face exactly.\u2019A few years ago, the age of the princess would be around three or four years old. Though he thought it might be difficult for her to remember such a thing since she was so young.Xenon began to guide her with satisfaction.\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s drinking in the vacant lot near the annex by now. I\u2019ll escort you, princess.\u201d***Viola recalled the contents of the novel.\u300c Hixen was raised by a violent father. Hixen\u2019s only wish was to save his mother from her father\u2019s violence. \u300dWhen he turned fourteen, Hixen picked up a kitchen knife to save his mother.\u300c Hixen, fourteen, became a murderer. \u300dAnd ran away.There are second and third fathers in the outside world, he thought. There must be people who were better than his father. Hixen escaped from his father, but the world was even worse than his father.So, Hixen then made a commitment.\u201cI need to be strong.\u201dHixen became stronger.He learned swordsmanship by chasing wandering knights, and beat swordsmen by searching for each swordsmanship seal. He became strong. After becoming friends with Heron Verratoux, he traveled through the battlefield and became a war hero. One day, the young Heron asked him.\u300c \u201cHixen, what\u2019s your dream?\u201d \u300dHixen replied,\u300c \u201cTo be a warm husband and a wonderful father.\u201d\u201cHusband? Father?\u201d\u201cYes, living with a family I love, who loves me as well. That\u2019s my dream.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pathetic and useless dream, then.\u201d \u300dThat day, Hixen and Heron fought for four hours. In the fight, Hixen suffered a major injury to his stomach, and Heron seriously injured his arm. After a few years. Heron had no choice but to admit.\u201cIn the end, your dream came true.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHixen met his beloved wife and gave birth to a daughter who would feel sick \u2018with issues on every part of her body\u2019.\u201cWell, let\u2019s celebrate.\u201d\u201cAm I still pathetic in your eyes?\u201d\u300c \u201cYou are simple, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that pathetic.\u201d \u300dThe two fought numerous wars and understood each other more. Hixen said.\u300c \u201cI\u2019m out of the war now.\u201d \u300dHeron agreed. A powerful comrade named Hixen was killed in the war. It\u2019s a shame for him to leave, but Heron respected Hixen\u2019s sincerity.He\u2019d seen it for years. His friend dreamed off. A haven called home. A fence for his family. He is a friend who has lived his whole life for it. He respected that dream.However, one day.Hixen\u2019s daughter was kidnapped. While Hixen was searching for his daughter, his wife was found with a cold body and stabbed with a sword.He lost both his beloved wife and daughter on the same day, and became a drunkard.That happened in just three years.***Xenon was right.\u201cOh. Sir Hixen is sitting in the vacant lot.\u201dHe is under the influence of alcohol.\u201cXenon, wait here.\u201d\u201cDrunken Lord Hixen is dangerous, Princess. He\u2019s called rubbish because he can\u2019t see anything since he\u2019s not in his right mind.\u201dIt has been more than once that he got drunk and caused an accident. Many people in the annex were injured. It is surprising that the Duke had kept Hixen alive so far.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid the princess will get seriously hurt.\u201d Xenon grinned.\u201cIf he does harm the princess, I will cut off Lord Hixen\u2019s legs.\u201d\u201cBut at some point. I looked up to Sir Hixen.\u201dViola looked at Xenon. She made eye contact with him.\u201cXenon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou told me not to make it obvious if you want me to take the test, right?\u201dXenon scratched the back of his head.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be obvious, but you are too quick to notice.\u201dOh, my.It\u2019s difficult.I swallowed my words. The test is right.\u201cThe test is to \u2018do harm to the princess\u2019.\u201dVerratoux\u2019s princess should not be afraid of it. Though she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s for another reason, Fear cannot be the reason.\u201cLast warning.\u201dShe acted like Verratoux.\u201cIf you repeat the same mistake one more time, I\u2019d really doubt your qualification as a butler.\u201dIt was scarier than any warning to Xenon.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dWith Xenon behind her, Viola went closer to Hixen. He was shouting tremendously while throwing a bottle of alcohol.He threw a straightforward fastball out of nowhere.\u201cSir, does that bring back your dead daughter?\u201dHixen moved his head to the source of the sound. His eyes were bloodshot. His red-colored eyes as though he was on drugs, as well as his shaking body.\u201cWhat did you say, you crazy little girl!\u201dHe certainly didn\u2019t look sane. Viola went closer. Hixon picked up the bottle.It seemed that he had drank a lot. His cheeks and eyes were bloodshot, and he acted as if he were going to hit Viola. If she is an ordinary child, she would have run away and felt scared.Hixen said, whose tongue was all twisted.\u201cGet away!\u201dViola approached even more closely.\u201cMister.\u201dViola looked up at him.\u201cYour daughter is dead.\u201d\u201cYou crazy kid!\u201d Hixen lifted his sturdy palm.Viola didn\u2019t blink at all. Although, she felt like she was going to die while shaking inside. \u2018Geez, you\u2019re not really gonna hit me, are you?\u2019Hixen never hit a child. No matter how drunk or how insincere he is, he would never touch a child. It\u2019s a characteristic that he has kept for his whole life. However, when she looked into the eyes of Hixen, who was once a hero, Viola felt like her head was going crazy.\u2018I believe in what the novel said!\u2019She was terrified, but she held it in. She made eye contact and hid her fear. His arm, which went up in the air, trembled and soon calmed down.\u201cI said go away.\u201dIn the end, Hixen didn\u2019t hit Viola. She kept looking at him with an indifferent expression, a face that seemed to be staring at something out of sincerity.\u201cDo you want to know who killed your daughter?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dJust in time, there was a strange chilly wind that was not like a spring wind.\u201cI saw it.\u201dViola\u2019s purple hair fluttered along with the wind breeze.Just in time, Viola was smiling with her mouth curled up. A grim look was made. The expression and the lifeless beauty of Viola gave off a subtle atmosphere. It was a perfect atmosphere for a Verratoux.Of course, she didn\u2019t mean to do it.However, her natural expression and atmosphere were like that. She then made eye contact with Hixen. Viola said again.\u201cDo you want to know who killed your daughter?\u201dViola decided to act out what was in the novel in Arin\u2019s way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hixen\u2019s body shook. No matter how much he was drunk, his ears irked whenever the word \u2018daughter\u2019 was heard.\u201cWhat, you\u2026\u201dAll the drunkenness in him simmered down before he knew it.Viola gulped. It is said that there is mana in this world, and if he makes up his mind, he can blow away all the senses in his body. It seemed to be true. His eyes, which were like rotten fish\u2019s eyes, came back alive.\u201cI saw your daughter.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201dHixen\u2019s eyes flashed to life. The word \u2018daughter\u2019 was the whole meaning of his existence.\u201cSvenu slum, eleventh Street. Under the sewers of the terrible site.\u201dAll of this is about Hixen, who came to his senses a few years later, by learning for himself. Hixen learns to calm down by teaching Tundra. He went back to the very beginning and looked for traces of his daughter. Eventually, he found his enemy.Viola continued nonchalantly.\u201cRed hair like it\u2019s burning. Raisins of freckles on the cheeks. She had small cross-shaped earrings on her ears.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHixen\u2019s body has hardened. \u2018Is this really a Verratoux?\u2019 He didn\u2019t know who this girl was. But she was emitting the energy of Verratoux.\u2018There\u2019s no way there\u2019s a Verratoux I don\u2019t know.\u2019Judging from her clothes, she seemed to be part of a family that had a high reputation. However, he didn\u2019t believe it completely. Over the past three years, there have been many people who have approached him this way. All of them wanted to use Hixen\u2019s sword skills.The misfortune of Hixen as an individual is like luck to many powerful men who wanted him. So, Hixen no longer believes in people.\u201cShe firmly believed that her father would come to her rescue the moment she was dying. She was proud to have a father like you.\u201dHow she died was not described in detail, though it seems that something terrible had happened that Viola was reluctant to describe.\u201cAnyway, she\u2019s definitely dead. I saw it with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cWith your own eyes?\u201d\u201cI told you. I was in the slums.\u201dHixen clenched his fist. In fact, he was expecting that his daughter was dead. However, he did not admit it until now. Even now, he still didn\u2019t want to admit it. As he tried to yell no, Viola quickly continued.\u201cYou were a hero, and you were called the Black Whale, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026What the hell do you want to say, kiddo?\u201dThe way he talks is a lot more calm. He seemed to have figured that Viola was not talking nonsense.\u201cAnd you are also a friend of my great father, the Master of Winter Castle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOnly then did Hixen discover who this girl is.Recently, Winter Castle was noisy. Duke Heron said he had brought in an adopted daughter from the slums. Then, it made sense, the fact that Viola saw his daughter accidentally in the slums. The doubt disappeared a little.\u201cAre you Viola?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Anyway, you had the same talent as my father. You\u2019re a hero. Your wife and daughter are killed and kidnapped. Then, it\u2019s either.\u201dViola grinned.\u201cYou\u2019re a madman who\u2019s lost his nerve without knowing the world.\u201dShe added.\u201cWhat a thoroughly planned crime.\u201dViola gently twisted her purple hair with her index finger.\u201cWhat do you think, Uncle? Do you think it\u2019s a crazy guy who lost his cowardice? Or was it thoroughly planned and moved by someone?\u201dShe added.\u201cIf you\u2019re a lunatic who\u2019s lost his cowardice, you\u2019d have found it out quickly because you\u2019re a capable man.\u201dViola then continued, \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t find it. Besides, the timing was exquisite, isn\u2019t that right?\u201dHis daughter was kidnapped, while he was out looking for his daughter, his wife died.\u201cAs if someone had calculated it elaborately.\u201dWhen he lost his wife and daughter, he wasn\u2019t in the right mindset to look back and understand the situation. And after that, Hixen became a drunkard and didn\u2019t look at the situation clearly.\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you consider how a kid like me could find that out? Is this really all a coincidence?\u201dViola felt a little remorse. \u2018Actually, I\u2019m guessing everything on my own.\u2019All of this is inferred by Hixen\u2019s sane mind. He will find his enemy. The enemy is also deeply related to the novel\u2019s final villain.\u201cThink about it, man. Who was the one who benefited the most from your craziness?\u201dMeanwhile, Xenon looked up at the sky. The sun was setting. The sky is turning red, as though it is embedded with blood.The red sunset was on Viola\u2019s face. Viola\u2019s visage looked like it was burning.\u2018It\u2019s a beautiful sunset.\u2019It\u2019s a good day to wake up the Black Whale.***The conversation ended well.When Hixen raised his fist, Xenon coughed for nothing. He said to Viola, sneaking away from her eyes.\u201cAnyway, for three years, Lord Hixen has not allowed anyone to break into his space.\u201d\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d\u201cThe Duke gave Sir Hixen a room, and he never came here.\u201dViola nodded. \u2018If he really wants to go, that\u2019s all.\u2019If he comes to his senses, he may not know, but Hixen is not the type to cheer up and comfort himself.If Hixen comes to his senses. As if he had never done it, he would have been his friend again, or he would have killed him himself.That must have been Heron\u2019s last consideration for his friend.Viola drank a sip of warm apple tea. A refreshing scent spread through her mouth. \u2018I haven\u2019t changed the plot that much.\u2019 Hixen was about to come to his senses anyway. She didn\u2019t change the content of the novel significantly.Hixen sat in front of Viola.\u201cMy friend, he\u2019s got a funny daughter.\u201d\u201cEveryone says so.\u201d\u201cSo. What do you want?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dHixen smirked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people who had eyes like you, kid.\u201d\u201cWhat do my eyes look like?\u201d\u201cHeron-like eyes.\u201d\u201cI look like father? I\u2019m an adopted daughter.\u201d\u201cIt means you\u2019ll never lose to anything.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dViola waited for the heat to cool down.Why? She does this when she reads novels. She followed the novel. Fortunately or not, she was born with an arrogant look. Thanks to it, she looked like an experienced negotiator.Hixen spoke after a while.\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time, just tell me what you want.\u201d\u201cI have a dog.\u201d\u201cDog?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a dog, but it\u2019s also a person. It\u2019s big, and sometimes, it even bites.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHixen was strangely convincing. Viola is somewhat annoyed by it, but it was also comfortable.\u201cSir, please tame him.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cTeach him how to wield a sword.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find your daughter\u2019s killer.\u201d\u201cI can find them on my own.\u201dViola almost lost her words for a moment. That was true. It was mentioned that Hixen was capable of finding things in the novel as well. It\u2019s because he\u2019s drunk, but if he\u2019s not, he is as good as Duke Heron.\u201cWhy are you saying no?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201cJust try meeting him first.\u201dThe story changes once they meet. Hixen had fallen in love as soon as he saw him. He immediately realized that Tundra was born with a body for swords.Hixen said teasingly.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201dViola decided to change the strategy a little.\u201cSir.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d be very cool because your dying child called for you so desperately. While I was hiding in the sewers, her words \u2018 dad\u2019 came to her mouth as if it were a sacred phrase.\u201dHixen closed his eyes for a moment. His heart sank when he remembered his daughter.\u201cBut now that I look at it, you are not cool at all.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDo I have to repeat it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m, uh, asking you to help me.\u201dFor a moment, Xenon\u2019s ears pricked.Here it is.The virtue of a ruler. She had a mercenary art that could handle people by changing masks freely. He then focused more on Viola\u2019s words.\u201cI want to live.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s killing you?\u201d\u201cI studied a lot about this place.\u201dIt was true. She studied the novel\u2019s worldview a lot, and she was also a fan of the characters.\u201cThis place is wild. My mother and brothers, who want to kill me, live here. And there\u2019s also a violent father.\u201dHixen was particularly sensitive to one word.\u201cA violent father?\u201d\u201cMy father is indifferent to me. He is throwing me in the wild like this. Being so indifferent is a kind of violence.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said he was smart. You know why I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re pretending you don\u2019t know anything.\u201dViola reached out her hand.\u201cPlease stay with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI need an adult to lean on.\u201dI hit a nail in Hixen\u2019s heart.\u201cI\u2019m alone.\u201dHixen could see Viola\u2019s hand in his eyes. Viola\u2019s hand looked especially pale and small. His eyes began to shake wildly. He knows his daughter because he has raised her. This child is much smaller than seven years of age. So, even if she says she is five years old, he would even believe it. A girl of such a small build reached out her hand.\u201cHold my hand.\u201dThe last phrase touched Hixen\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Carlton is one of the few close associates who can pull out a sword in front of Heron Verratoux. He aimed towards the man who was entering the room.\u201cSir Hixen, be polite.\u201dWho dares to open the door of the duke\u2019s office without knocking?Hixen grabbed the blade of the thin sword with his finger and pushed it away. Duke Heron, who was sitting on a chair and glancing at the documents, opened his mouth.\u201cJust leave it.\u201dHixen smirked and approached Heron, who didn\u2019t bat an eye towards him once since he entered the room.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou have a cute daughter.\u201dAt that moment, Heron\u2019s body flinched.\u201cCute?\u201dIt was strange to hear \u2018cute\u2019 through Hixen\u2019s mouth. Verratoux and cuteness are more opposite than oil and water. That was how it had been and how it was supposed to be. One can\u2019t be cute.\u201cYes, she is very cute.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not Verratoux-like.\u201dHixen sat with his hips attached to Heron\u2019s desk.\u201cDo you remember what my old dream is? A dream that you laughed at.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHeron continued to sign the document with his fountain pen without answering. It didn\u2019t seem like he was concentrating on what Hixen was saying.\u201cI had lost that dream, and my world had collapsed.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cAnd I became a drunkard.\u201d Hixen sat cross-legged.\u201cI know why you let me stay there in the annex.\u201dHe pointed his finger at Carlton.\u201cThat old cunt would have always insisted on kicking me out.\u201dHe continued. \u201cYour wife, like a snake, would have been looking for a chance to poison me as well. Because I am a stain to Verratoux.\u201d\u201cYou know it well.\u201dHeron signed another document, then handed it over to Carlton. Carlton, who received the document, bowed down and left the room. So, the only people left in the office are Duke Heron and Hixen.\u201cAnd yet, you left me in the annex.\u201dOnly then did Duke Heron become his old friend. He looked at Hixen and spoke honestly without hiding his thoughts.\u201cIf you don\u2019t get better. I\u2019ll have you by my side to kill you myself.\u201d\u201cHow long are you going to wait and see?\u201d\u201cFive years.\u201d\u2018Five years.\u2019 Hixen burst into laughter. \u2018As expected, Heron is Heron. He hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s how my friend Heron respects me.\u201d\u201cYou must have come to your senses.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a big dream to become a new person again, but my dream\u2019s right anyway.\u201dHeron\u2019s eyebrows raised.\u201cDream?\u201d\u201cYes, your daughter. Viola, who is registered as your ten-year-old daughter on paper.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to say, Hixen?\u201d\u201cThe absolute law that you and I set as children, do you remember?\u201dChildren under ten years old would not die, no matter what. That was the promise between Heron and Hixen. In fact, it was actually Hixen who proposed it.Hixen said.\u201cChildren deserve protection. They have the right to grow up and be loved.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cYou might accept your daughter on paper, but I\u2019m accepting your daughter with my heart.\u201dHe continued his words. \u201cWhat do you say? You don\u2019t really care about being a father anyway. You just need an excellent successor. So, don\u2019t you like the idea?\u201dHeron looked silently at Hixen. He didn\u2019t even ask the details.\u201cDo as you please.\u201dHearing so, Hixen rose from his seat. He thought back at that moment with Viola.\u2018Give me your dainty hand and help me.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2019\u201cShe asked me to stand by her, saying she needed an adult who she can rely on.\u201d\u201c\u2026Not like Verratoux.\u201d\u201cThat is true.\u201d Hixen grinned.\u201cThough she isn\u2019t obsequious at all. Even when she asked me for help, I am surprised because her attitude is so Verratoux. She also had an amazing atmosphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it just an act?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie? I\u2019m just telling you the way it was. Viola looks like a Verratoux, but she\u2019s also strangely different from Verratoux as well. She\u2019s a very attractive little girl.\u201d\u201cYou said something similar to Xenon.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s very Verratoux-like, but it feels like advanced Verratoux.\u2019 Hixen seemed to have felt something similar.\u201cI think I\u2019ll fence with her, so she can grow up more properly, to grow up in a more beautiful world.\u201dHeron nodded.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to care much as long as the child could succeed as a Verratoux.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dWhen he was leaving, there was a smile lingering around Hixen\u2019s mouth.\u2018Look at him? Hixen is different from usual. He even thinks Viola is cute.\u2019That can\u2019t be true.Though Hixen was right, it seemed like Duke Heron couldn\u2019t admit it himself yet.That night.Heron Verratoux\u2019s seven fountain pens are broken. No one knew why.Two days before the welcoming dinner.Duke Heron suddenly invited Viola to dinner separately. However, the reason why was unknown.Viola was very uncomfortable. Dinner with him had always been her dream, but she didn\u2019t want this kind of atmosphere.There was a long silence.It felt like she was sitting on a thorny seat. In front of her is a delicious sweet potato soup and grilled duck mixed with special sauce, yet she couldn\u2019t eat it.It\u2019s been about ten minutes.It wasn\u2019t until ten minutes had passed before the Duke Heron opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re good at wearing masks.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t understand what he meant, Viola just took the compliment anyways, like a beast, like a Verratoux.\u201cI heard you asked Hixen to stay with you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you ask him to hold your hand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dViola had a hunch. This is a test.Verratoux should not ask for help obsequiously. Verratoux should be in a position of providing help, not seeking help.So, she laughed on purpose.\u201cIf I use him well, don\u2019t you think it will be good?\u201dDuke Heron looked at her, and Viola made eye contact without avoiding even though she was very nervous on the inside. Duke Heron\u2019s eyes are like a black hole. If she stared at it for too long, it felt as if she was going to be sucked in, and her whole body was going to be torn apart.\u2018That\u2019s weird. That\u2019s oddly different from his normal behavior.\u2019 The Duke does not have a private meeting with succession candidates. This was because he knew that each action may empower some people.Her thoughts wandered inside her mind, but she smiled brightly on the outside. Viola spoke with a more evil look than before.\u201cThe idealist who dreams beautifully. He\u2019s really good to use, right?\u201dShe acted with all her might to avoid being caught by Duke Heron.\u201cAs expected.\u201d\u2018Pardon?\u2019 Viola is a little ashamed. Heron looked more satisfied than she thought.\u201cYou held out your cute hand and asked him.\u201d\u201cI did reach out.\u201dViola looked down at her hands. \u2018Hmm.\u2019 It\u2019s a small, cute, and pretty hand that didn\u2019t seem to match her character\u2019s personality.\u201cHixen took that hand, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola looked at Heron after he mumbled, \u201cHmm.\u201dAside from the heavy and brutal atmosphere, his handsomeness flew around.\u201cDon\u2019t lose sight of his hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d\u201cIt would be gone if you blink.\u201dViola gulped. As expected, it is a worldview that cannot be neglected.\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dThere was no other sound, only clatters from the fork and knife touching the glass bowl.Viola carefully looked at Heron\u2019s eyes. \u2018Breathtaking!\u2019 She couldn\u2019t tell whether the food went over her nose or mouth.The main menu is done, and the frozen persimmon is served as dessert.\u2018Delicious!\u2019Viola\u2019s eyes grew bigger. She had a lot of ripe persimmons on Earth but never once tasted anything like this before. Sweetness lingered in her mouth.\u2018It\u2019s melting.\u2019 The honey and the ripe persimmon have exquisite harmony together. The sweet pudding seemed to just melt in her mouth.\u201cYou like sweets.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m a child, after all.\u201dThe Duke glanced at Viola, and she felt suffocated again.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cWhen I\u2019m eating something delicious, can you please stop looking at me?\u201dXenon, who was some distance away behind Viola, flinched.\u201cPrincess?\u201d\u2018Who talks to Duke Heron like that?\u2019Fortunately, Duke Heron didn\u2019t appear to be upset.\u201cHow come?\u201dViola just replied back briefly.\u201cIt\u2019s rude of you to stare at me when I eat.\u201dDuke Heron recalled Rael saying something similar before as well.\u2018Can you stop staring at me? It\u2019s rude when you stare at me like that.\u2019Rael was the only one who spoke to Heron this way. At that time, Heron replied.\u2018I\u2019m your husband.\u2019Heron had a faint smile then, too. However, now, he was expressionless and replied no expression.\u201cI am your father.\u201dHe looked around.\u201cAll the pleasant environment and the delicious food you enjoy right now came from me. The egg tart, which you are so eager to eat, and now this cold red persimmon. Yet you gave me that kind of disrespectful action.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t come here because I wanted to. You just bring me here at your will and show off?\u201dIs it a coincidence?Viola\u2019s attitude is similar to Rael\u2019s.She just said whatever came to her mind.\u2018You said you are married to me because you loved me.\u2019\u2018I love you, too, but what if you ask me to marry you first, and then you show it off?\u2019Duke Heron lifted the fork. For a moment, Viola was slightly surprised. Looking at his atmosphere and attitude, she was worried that he might poke her in the eye with that fork.\u201cIt\u2019s not a good word to hear, but I guess it\u2019s not wrong.\u201dAfter a while, his adopted daughter, who was looking at herself and reliving her appetite, suddenly caught her eyes onto him.Her eyes looked as though she was curious.\u201cDaddy, is that good?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it\u2019s rude to stare at someone while they are eating?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m your daughter.\u201dShe repeated the words that Heron said earlier.\u201cFather was the first one to do the impolite action. It\u2019s Verratoux\u2019s way. I just returned what I received, whether it\u2019s a grudge or a favor.\u201dEven if the opponent is Duke Heron, it was a principle that should be put to use. That was a very Verratoux-like action.He could feel Viola\u2019s eyes. Duke Heron was staring at her. If she didn\u2019t look away, she would be able to convince him that she was not afraid.\u2018I\u2019ll just stare back! Yeah, just appreciate his good looks.\u2019 Viola tried to reassure herself. \u2018That would be less scary. He\u2019s handsome. Yes, yes.\u2019She didn\u2019t avoid eye contact since now she was less scared because she savored his handsomeness.\u2018Handsome, handsome.\u2019Duke Heron also held eye contact with her. Her extremely Verratoux-like eyes looked a little bit pretty. Coincidentally, Hixen\u2019s words came into his mind.\u2018You have a cute daughter.\u2019\u2018Cute.\u2019 He could feel her eyes continuously staring at him. He couldn\u2019t understand why those eyes are so likable.\u2018You have a cute daughter.\u2019Creek.The fork that the Duke was holding bent like a taffy.Aren\u2019t those round eyes cute?No, it couldn\u2019t have been.Never. She is just a child born with the virtue of a ruler who freely changes her mask.The Duke asked with a stern look.\u201cIs this some sort of self-defense?\u201dWhen Viola wanted to answer, Heron encountered an unexpected situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Self-made room.\u201dShe spoke in a straightforward manner, but she seemed to mispronounce the word \u2018self-defense\u2019 since it was a little difficult for a seven-year-old, with the growth status of a five years old, to pronounce.Suddenly, Carlton\u2019s words came to his mind.\u2018I think her growth was very slow because she couldn\u2019t eat properly.\u2019Suddenly, that tiny body and big eyes caught his eyes even more. For some reason, his heart ached. Duke Heron pronounced it again.\u201cSelf-defense.\u201d\u201cYes, self made room.\u201d\u201cSelf-defense.\u201dViola noticed what the duke was trying to do. She readied her lips and put a lot of pressure on her tongue before trying to say it again.\u201cSelf Made Room!\u201dThough, she couldn\u2019t overcome her physical limitations.\u201cPronounce it correctly. Self-defense.\u201d\u201cSelf, made, room.\u201d\u2018Damn it! I couldn\u2019t pronounce it right.\u2019Meanwhile, Xenon doubted his eyes. \u2018The duke is smiling darkly?\u2019 It was very faint but smiling, but it was caught by Xenon\u2019s keen eyes. He didn\u2019t understand why Duke Heron was smiling.Duke Heron spoke again.\u201cSelf-defense.\u201d\u201cConfidently!!!\u201dViola was annoyed. She was expressionless and tried to pronounce it the best she could.She wanted to hit something. \u2018Then, my neck will be gone, right?\u2019 Regardless, her irritation soared. When she tried to say something, sometimes, her pronunciation would be slightly off, especially the word \u2018self-defense.\u2019\u2018My underdeveloped body!\u2019The duke and Viola\u2019s eyes met. His eyes were smiling slightly. The subtle smile left Han Arin with a strange sense of defeat, and her face turned a little red without realizing it.\u2018Aish.\u2019Never once in her life that she would be teased by her pronunciation after twenty one years of her life. Then, an indescribable sense of shame rose from her head to toe.\u201cNo manners and bad pronunciation. Yet you are so lively.\u201dIn fact, he wasn\u2019t offended. Instead, he was rather satisfied with her liveliness. Verratoux should be like that. He would have been disappointed if she didn\u2019t breathe out her liveliness when she felt teased.However, Viola was surprised. This body must have lost its life without realizing it. When she came to her senses, the life that leaked without realizing disappeared by itself.\u201cYou\u2019re good at making ends meet.\u201dHeron misunderstood due to common sense. She\u2019s good at controlling her life path. He recalled the words of Xenon and Hixen. \u2018A girl who\u2019s like a Verratoux, but not at the same time.\u2019She cannot hide her extreme greed for cold, ripe persimmons. At the same time, she has a mind that knows how to handle her life thoroughly.All this would be a thoroughly calculated production.A life that popped up from time to time. Those cute eyes and her killing instinct that barely suppresses. That was what it truly is. \u2018That\u2019s how she looks, huh. I like it, Viola.\u2019However, it was weird.He kept looking at that plump peach-colored fur ball.\u2018It\u2019s not about her cuteness.\u2019He didn\u2019t know if she was still learning manners since another orange persimmon was on her lips. Duke Heron didn\u2019t understand nor know what was on her mind for her to eat that way.\u2018What is she thinking?\u2019Why was she eating so aggressively with that dainty hand? The form of her holding the fork tightly was also sloppy.Duke Heron kept seeing such behaviors rather than Verratoux\u2019s manners.It was really strange.***The dawn broke, and early birds began to sing.Bang! Bang! Bang! There was a loud knock, which didn\u2019t match well with the peaceful morning. There were only a few people who could knock so roughly on the princess\u2019s door.The door was smashed down a moment later.It was none other than Hixen who knocked on the door.\u201cMister, is that a knock?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026\u201dHixen smiled awkwardly.\u201cI couldn\u2019t control my strength.\u201d\u201cCouldn\u2019t control?\u201dIn other words, Hixen had not been training in the last three years, so his manna wasn\u2019t activated properly either. After living like that for three years, he needed to start training again. He couldn\u2019t fully control his strength these days because of the sudden activation of mana.\u201cAre you really a war hero?\u201dHe knocked on his stomach. He drank so much that he was seriously obese.\u201cThree years is enough time for a person to ruin their life.\u201d\u201cHow long until you get better?\u201d\u201cA month is enough.\u201dViola nodded.\u201cHurry up and fix yourself.\u201dHixen plodded along and sat down on the chair.\u201cViola, I think I\u2019ve got some clues because of you.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s great.\u201dHonestly, he just needed to dip into the water. He was a hero, who was comparable to Duke Heron in the past, he would do well on his own.\u201cOh, but more importantly.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDid you eat with Heron yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018Wait?\u2019 Viola flinched.\u2018The idealist who dreams beautifully. It\u2019s really good to use, right?\u2019 He didn\u2019t hear that, did he? She got nervous for no reason. Though judging from Hixen\u2019s attitude, it didn\u2019t seem so.\u201cNo manners, bad pronunciation. I was scolded for showing off my liveliness.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe glanced at Viola as if he was enjoying it.\u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t look like it, Heron is a sweet guy.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 Huh? You know?\u201d Hixen looked puzzled.\u201cI thought he would be the only person who would\u2019ve scolded me. He wouldn\u2019t even say any warm words.\u201dIn Viola\u2019s heart, her pride suddenly burst into tears without her realizing it. He was her favorite character. Even if I have to reveal my favorite, I will admit that.Hixen continued to be puzzled.\u201cThat\u2019s Heron Verratoux.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cJust by looking at him.\u201dThat\u2019s my favorite character anyway. He\u2019s raising cute hedgehogs. Duke Heron was nicer than I thought, although he was still a little scary.Hixen stuck his tongue out at the absurdity.\u201cWhat are you so confident about? Why are your eyes so confident? I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s kind of annoying.\u201d\u201cWhy? Can\u2019t I be confident?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so serious about this?\u201d\u201cBecause I mean it.\u201d\u201cI-Is that so?\u201d He scratched the back of his head.\u201cYou\u2019re still defending your father.\u201dEven though she may look upset, Viola didn\u2019t actually feel bad. Actually, it was rather pleasant. Viola spoke again.\u201cSo, why are you talking about my father?\u201d\u201cThat guy, he seems to be interested in you for some reason.\u201d\u201cHuh? Is that so?\u201d\u201cHe must have adopted you because he was interested in you in the first place.\u201d\u2018She was adopted by the greatest duke on the continent and was given the attention of Heron Verratoux, the great winder lord. However, her reaction about this was rather too bland.\u2019 Hixen thought.\u2018Oh? Wow! That\u2019s incredible!\u2019He expected her to say something like that instead. \u2018I\u2019ve been adopted by such a noble family! The famous monarch of the winter castle is my father!\u2019Shouldn\u2019t her reaction be something like that?Lost in his thoughts, Hixen was thinking, \u2018is it weird for me to look forward to seeing a rich expression of emotion from a seven years old child?\u2019Viola frowned slightly and made eye contact with Hixen.\u201cI hate violent fathers.\u201dIndifference was also violence, especially in this bizarre environment. Hixen\u2019s expression suddenly brightened.\u201cAs expected, right?\u201dHe seemed to be in a good mood somehow. So, Viola felt like she won against Duke Heron.\u201cWell, yeah. There shouldn\u2019t be such a thing as a violent father.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll protect you. I\u2019ll stay with you and be a good adult.\u201d\u201cLose your belly fat first.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get caught wielding a knife.\u201dHixen smiled awkwardly. He couldn\u2019t refute that statement because it was true. He then turned the subject around.\u201cWhere is your dog that I should tame?\u201d***Viola leaned against the door. Today would be the first meeting between Tundra and Hixen. If it were the same as in the novel, the two would fight with each other. Tundra didn\u2019t want to lose to anyone, and Hixen hated such a kid. Viola was excited to see if it would be like the novel.Though she didn\u2019t seem to be the only one who was excited, next to her, Xenon also watched the two with an expression that he was anticipating something fun.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the trainer would be Lord Hixen. I didn\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\u201cEven if I have a belly, I\u2019m still a good trainer.\u201dI heard a voice approaching. It seemed that Tundra didn\u2019t really like Hixen.\u201cYou\u2019re my trainer?\u201dIn fact, Tundra was not convinced. He expected a plausible person because Viola mentioned that he was a capable swordsman. Then suddenly, a man with a big belly appeared instead. He was well-built, but he was definitely not the kind of person Tundra had thought of.He looked at Viola.\u201cI told you I want to learn and master swordsmanship.\u201dHis voice was full of anger. There was also deep frustration mixed underneath his anger.\u201cI wanted to be a great saint and stand next to the princess.\u201dTo do so, he tried to master swordsmanship. He wanted to be next to that person, who she would reach out her hand to. Tundra tried to make an effort because he wanted to be a pet dog.\u201cBut this is\u2026\u201dHe felt like his new dream was being trampled on.No matter how much he looked at Hixen, he couldn\u2019t see him as a good swordsman. Hixen didn\u2019t look capable in the slightest, and his body reeked of alcohol from miles away. He truly looked untrained. He may even break his body soon as it seemed that he was drunk from somewhere before even coming here.Tundra bit his lips slightly.\u201cYou said I am just a toy. Is this how you really see me? Am I really just a toy?\u201d\u2018Is having the dream of being a dog too extravagant for me? The past few days, I have been so excited.\u2019 He gritted his teeth.Hixen shook his head.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a good attitude toward adults.\u201d\u201cAdults?\u201d\u201cYou need to learn to communicate with adults from scratch.\u201d He grinned.\u201cI tend to teach my students very strictly.\u201dHe stared at Tundra before continuing.\u201cKid. It\u2019s time for dogs and trainers from now on. Would you excuse me?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bad time.\u201dXenon glanced at Viola and laughed softly. \u201cMadam, you look excited.\u201d\u201cI like people with those looks in their eyes.\u201d Hixen grinned.He thought back to a few years ago. \u2018Heron used to look like this in the past. Now, he likes to nag and hide both the cunningness of a serpent and bravery of a tiger, but in the old days, he was just like this kid.\u2019\u201cThis reminds me of my old friend.\u201dViola hit the nail on the head.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a friend.\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cYou look like you don\u2019t have many friends.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a heartbreaking thing to say. I had a glorious past.\u201dHe shot back. \u201cYou kicked me in the past.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got a knack for hitting bones.\u201dViola\u2019s words were right. Unexpectedly, he is stabbed with her point. Hixen, who was the nail on the head, enjoyed this conversation.\u201cStill, I believe.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty good adult.\u201dHixen coughed very loudly at the words. Viola\u2019s words poked sharply into his heart.If his daughter were alive, she would have been a perfect mother. She would have become a really good adult. \u2018It\u2019s not too late.\u2019.Viola, not knowing how Hixen was feeling, threw a word of remorse and told him to lose the weight on his stomach again.\u201cAnd I think it would be cool if you lose your belly fat.\u201dHixen decided then that he would be a good adult to her. His motivation flared up from those thoughts.\u201cI\u2019ll try to look cool.\u201dHe turned his neck towards Tundra\u2019s direction.Bang!The sound echoed through the room. With a dull wooden sword in his hand, he faced Tundra. His eyes changed entirely from the way he looked at Viola.\u201cWe, between us guys. Let\u2019s have a steamy body conversation.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The monster shrieked while struggling to escape the water, but to the monster crocodiles, it must have sounded like a dinner bell announcing \u2018It\u2019s time to eat.\u2019 I had thought the crocodiles were sleeping, but they crawled leisurely into the water and glided softly toward the monster bird. The more it struggled, the more blue blood spread like ink from the severed arm, and the number of crocodiles anticipating a meal increased rapidly. The screams of the monster bird struggling to survive, the sound of bones crunched hard, and the sound of flesh being ripped hit my cochleas. I covered my ears with both hands and bit my lower lip with my upper teeth.\u2018If I had fallen, would I have died like that?\u2019I was now standing precariously on a narrow railing as thin as a knife, pointing out from the cliff. It was a narrow rocky slope with nowhere to sit. I put my head back and put my hands behind me to see if I could climb the cliff. I carefully tried to turn my body over, but there was not enough space.\u2018Ha! Now I\u2019m going to die for sure.\u2019 I leaned my head against the wall and looked at the sky. I couldn\u2019t afford to look down at all because the blue water seemed to pull me. When I looked at the spring sky, I remembered the amusement park where I went to play while holding hands with my father and mother in my childhood. At that time, I went around the safari safely in the car, but now I was experiencing the monster safari without safety equipment.I prayed that the passing monster birds would not recognize me. Hopefully, if monster snakes find me they don\u2019t crawl down. I hope that the monster insects will not mistake me for a flower and come closer. I prayed over and over again. Finally, everything felt too real, and my legs lost strength. I almost stumbled forward.\u2018No no!\u2019 I shook my head vigorously. You must always think positively!I decided to indulge myself in the memories of the first time I went to an amusement park with my family on a day in May. Yeah\u2026 That day, Mom and Dad had another big fight. Parents who don\u2019t have money tend to fight a lot.Dad went with his kids after a long time, so he suggested that we go to the most expensive fast food restaurant and eat something delicious and even Pat-bingsu.<b>*</b>\u00a0But my mother questioned why he would spend money on such a thing, and insisted on eating convenience store bowl noodles. And my tactless younger brother, Kang Joo-ho, ate bowl noodles and saved the money so he could ride the roller coaster four more times, but he ended up crying when my mother slapped him. Dad criticized Mom again, protesting why she would act like that toward the child.I hated such fights back then, but now I laughed. I think my mom said she wanted to save money, buy an apartment, and send us to study abroad. My mother, always nervous, collapsed from a stroke. Dad\u2019s hair turned rough like silver grass as he worked as a security guard for my sick mom\u2019s sake. Like the silver grass flying in the cold winter, my father often went out at dawn and came back at dawn.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u2019It was absurd to prepare for the entrance exam while working as a contract teacher, but I refused to give up on my dream because of family circumstances. Now I worried that my accident would have added more gray hair to my poor dad\u2019s head.\u201cKang Joo-ho, you punk, I hope you\u2019re doing well. If you\u2019re not doing it right\u2026 \u201dI screamed so loudly that the cliff rang. At the sound of my voice, the monster crocodiles raised their eyes languidly and looked up at me. However, knowing it was a distance they couldn\u2019t climb, they returned their attention to the water surface.Come to think of it, the water is clear and transparent. But isn\u2019t that lime water? In my curiosity, I looked down.Wobble~ My body shivered. As expected, the water was dangerous. I looked to the sky with my eyes closed. Then I reached out and touched the rock on the cliff with my fingertips. Small stones fell to the water. The monster crocodiles, looking drowsy, slid back into the water again.\u2018Such great hearing.\u2019I quietly turned my body sideways, picked up a stone from the ground, and put it under my skirt.\u2018Who knows? Maybe the material containing the cationic resin component I was looking for is hidden in this~\u2019 If I come back alive, I\u2019ll have to analyze the composition of this stone first. Doing this in a death or life situation, I remembered a teacher joking around with students in a past science class.\u201cGuys, do you know how to distinguish between literature and science? \u2018Don\u2019t stick chopsticks in the concept.<b>**</b>\u00a0If it\u2019s too electrifying it will be dangerous.\u2019 Then, literal students don\u2019t put it in. But what happens with science students? They put it in out of curiosity. They don\u2019t put it in just once, they die while writing down the difference in electricity rise according to the length.\u201dAt that time, I laughed while banging the desk saying it didn\u2019t make sense, but now I understood. After all, should I fall into that water? Then I would know for sure. The sun was setting before I knew it. I began to feel drowsy.\u2018I can\u2019t sleep.\u2019 Even if I tried to keep my eyelids wide open, in the distant sunset one to two suns appeared as my head dropped helplessly. Phew, I had to wake up somehow. However, I could only move my facial muscles. I blinked and opened my mouth. But that alone didn\u2019t wake me up. I decided to sing to chase away sleep.\u2018What can I sing to cheer up my depressed heart?\u2019I woke up my sleepy and reluctant brain and ordered it to select exciting music. Since I couldn\u2019t drink the iced Americano I loved so much, should I try something cold first?\u201cAmericano is good, good, good. Americano\u2019s strong, strong, strong~\u201d My throat was burning. Should I just eat Pat-bingsu? \u201cBingsu, Pat-bingsu, I love you, I love you~\u201dThen, like an adult, beer came to mind.\u201cIt\u2019s a very hot day, right? On a day like this, how nice it would be to have a cold beer and chat with you while lying in the Han River.\u201dThat jerk. I remembered my ex-boyfriend whispering love to me in the Han River.\u201cHey, you selfish and ungrateful bastard! Are you happy after abandoning me to marry a younger, richer, prettier, and taller girl? You bastard!\u201dSomehow, when I thought of my ex-boyfriend, I felt I had to show I was living well. That\u2019s right, let\u2019s stop being satisfied with songs. I have to live somehow. I looked side-to-side to see if there was anything useful. Of course, stones were sticking out.\u2018Maybe I should try rock climbing?\u2019 Even if I stand like a wall all day, I won\u2019t become a wall. I finally decided to throw myself away to live. Sinclair\u2019s body won\u2019t die anyway. I will only suffer the pain of death\u2026However, I wasn\u2019t sure if Sinclair\u2019s body could withstand the crocodile\u2019s strong teeth and heal the bite wounds. Still, her memories cheered me on, reassuring me I could survive.[tl/n: Poor Sinclair, the fact that she suffered so much that MC is saying that she would survive even if she falls and faces some wild monsters :\u2019)]\u2018Yeah, let\u2019s survive somehow.\u2019 First of all, to climb the cliff, I had to turn around and look at the wall. But it was cumbersome to climb up wearing this skirt so I loosened the belt, took off the skirt, and dropped it.But something amazing happened. Only the skirt fell, but the monster crocodiles began to slowly approach the skirt as if curious.\u2018Awesome, what is it? Do they have good eyesight or good hearing?\u2019 I felt chills running down my spine. \u2018If my body falls, it\u2019ll be cut in half. Nah, what half? It\u2019s going to disappear without a trace.\u2019I gently shook my butt and pulled down my underskirt, and I quickly threw it down the cliff.\u2018Iughh.\u2019 My sweating made the wind more chill.\u2018Now, can I slightly lift my body off the wall and turn it 180 degrees using one foot as a support?\u2019\u2018Keep up the hard work, right foot, and leg!\u2019 My life depended on a central axis. I turned my body slightly 15 degrees. The knife-edge railing held up well.\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019I mustered a little more courage and turned my body about 45 degrees. Then, with a crackling sound, the stone I was treading on fell down.At the \u2018crack,\u2019 \u2018trrrllong,\u2019 \u2018splash!\u2019 sounds, a group of monster crocodiles tried to dive in for their prey.Ah\u2026 My hands and feet were sweating. \u2018Can I really do it?\u2019No, it wasn\u2019t a question of whether I could do it or not. It was something that had to be done. Mulishness and resentment arose.\u2018Gerard! I can\u2019t believe you left me here alone! And yet you call yourself my husband?!\u2019I held back all the curse words that were about to erupt. Haaa\u2026 I decided to exhale deeply and make a 180-degree turn at once. \u2018Anyway, you have to turn around to climb the cliff.\u2019\u2018One, two, three!\u2019\u2018Wow! Is it because of acceleration?\u2019I passed the 120-degree section smoothly, and the front of my body and the cliff became one. As expected, nothing is impossible in the world. Good. I\u2019ve never scaled a cliff, but let\u2019s try it like a Hollywood action actress.\u2018Still, wouldn\u2019t the author have created it so that she can do this much as a villain in the novel?\u2019I lifted my head and grabbed the wall that protruded at 2 o\u2019clock with my right hand. When climbing a rock, three of the four points of the hands and feet must be attached to the rock wall to maintain the balance of the body, so I checked to see if there was a place to hold at the 9 o\u2019clock position.Yes!! Fortunately, a sharp bump was visible. I gripped it tightly with my left hand, and finally, I put my left foot to the 7 o\u2019clock position.\u2018Okay, now we\u2019re going to climb out of this narrow railing.\u2019\u2018Thank you, oh narrow-as-a-knife railing for saving my life, but goodbye.\u2019 I placed my left foot on it then my right foot, as I groped toward the next target and then,Damn it! The lifeline that supported my right foot, the knife-thin railing, suddenly cracked and broke.\u2018Shit, it\u2019s all over.\u2019Instantly, the sound of a swarm of monster crocodiles entering the water, having sensed my movements, hit my cochlea and traveled through my spinal cord. That fear finally stimulated the peripheral nerves of my fingertips and toes.In the end, my hands and feet lost strength and slipped!\u201cHuuaaak!\u201dSplash!I shouted, but soon freshwater filled my mouth.\u2018Wow, it\u2019s amazingly clean!\u2019 I was impressed with the refreshing water I drank for the first time since coming here.As soon as I met the eyes of the crocodile that appeared in front of me, I hit it hard with my hand, starting with its nose.\u2018Uuhk!\u2019 I struggled as much as I could and hit it with repeated blows.But that was also a limitation. Imagine a five-meter-tall crocodile with its mouth open. I wasn\u2019t even a bite away.\u2018Goodbye, my poor, pitiful life.\u2019I think I didn\u2019t sell my country in my previous life but all mankind\u2026Skeptical, I prayed that in my next life, every part of me would be scattered throughout the universe and never be reborn.\u2014\u2014<b>*Pat-bingsu:</b>\u00a0is a Korean shaved ice dessert with sweet toppings that may include chopped fruit, condensed milk, fruit syrup, and red beans.<b>**Concept:</b>\u00a0This is actually funny (kind of?) in Korean since the word concept \u2018\ucf58\uc149\ud2b8\u2019 and outlet \u2018\ucf58\uc13c\ud2b8\u2019 are written similarly as you can see. Also, Korean chopsticks are commonly made of iron or stainless steel, unlike other Asian countries that usually have chopsticks made of wood and bamboo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, he would grow to be the world\u2019s best swordsman. Viola walked in the hallway with a light heart.\u2018Oh?\u2019Far away, someone was seen walking towards her. The man was wearing a striking red suit, while his tall height was another feature that she noticed. His face was pale, together with his short hair and his bright red lips. Viola could tell exactly who it was.\u2018Seivan Marcos!\u2019Seivan Marcos. He was one of Duke Heron\u2019s close aides.Thinking she should discover more about him, Viola continued her steps towards the man. His movements were slightly alluring.\u201cOh my, Who is this? Aren\u2019t you Princess Viola, the new sixth Princess?\u201dSeivan also made eye contact with Xenon, who was behind Viola.\u201cXenon looks nice today, too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I saw you.\u201d Xenon bowed down lightly. In the meantime, Viola opened her mouth.\u201cAren\u2019t you Seivan Marcos?\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201dSeivan Marcos opened his eyes wide. Smiling, she curled a strand of her bobbed hair with her index finger.\u201cDid the duke introduce me to you already?\u201dTwirling with her hair around her chin, Viola poked out my lips. Though before she could say anything, he continued.\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s not such a meticulous man.\u201dShe asked. \u201cThen, why do you like him when he\u2019s not thoughtful at all?\u201dSeivan\u2019s body flinched after hearing Viola\u2019s words. It seemed that he acknowledged her mild manner.\u201cBecause he is handsome.\u201dThe duke\u2019s appearance is the exact opposite of Seivan Marcos, whom he entrusted to the winter castle\u2019s affairs. After becoming a close associate, Duke Heron also knew Seivan\u2019s thoughts, so he flatly refused him.[ \u201cSeivan Marcos, I don\u2019t like men.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like women, either.\u201d\u201cI value your ability. That\u2019s why I put you next to me. Don\u2019t cross the line.\u201d ]In the novel, the duke warns him fiercely. He said it very clearly that he would kill him if he ever did something stupid.\u201cDying because of the Duke would be rather ecstatic.\u201dThis was a fantasy world, and sadly, it is not a world where gay people are welcomed. Usually, they are discriminated against, and in severe cases, they would be stoned to death. So, growing up as a close aide to the duke meant that his ability is rather excellent.Viola opened her mouth again, \u201cYou\u2019re one of my father\u2019s close aides, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, for now.\u201d\u201cA masquerade and puppeteer who trusts and is in love with my father. In my opinion, you\u2019re handsome.\u201d\u201cDid you study about me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRather than saying study, reading about him would be more accurate. His character did come out often, though. Seivan Marcos had been described as quite capable. He was good at creating masks using corpses, and also excelled in disguising by using makeup, as well as handling dolls.Seivan grinned. \u201cHow does the Six Princess see me?\u201dHe added a word while twisting his hair.\u201cEveryone says that I\u2019m disgusting.\u201d\u201cOh. You are disgusting.\u201dViola, in the original novel, did say that he was incredibly disgusting.Seivan liked to admit his ability, saying that he was just plain gross rather than peeling pumpkin seeds.After observing, I decided to follow the flow. The words were similar, but the details were different from what she said in the novel.\u201cThat\u2019s a heartbreaking thing to say.\u201dOne corner of his mouth went up. It didn\u2019t look like things were going too bad. It didn\u2019t seem like he was upset.\u201cYou\u2019re some twisted pervert.\u201d\u201cI often hear that I am broken.\u201dViola glanced at Seivan. As a fan of his work, I then recited a straight to the point opinion.\u201cWhether it\u2019s men or women, it\u2019s dirty to be flirting with married people.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201dSeivan opened his eyes round.\u201cCome to think of it, that\u2019s true?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business whether you like men or women, but my father is married.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a marriage.\u201d\u201cRegardless, he\u2019s still married.\u201dDuke Heron signed a marriage pledge with two wives.\u201cMarriage is a vow to someone, isn\u2019t it? Even if you exclude the feeling of love.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cHence, it\u2019s not normal for you to squeeze yourself between their vows and beg for my father\u2019s love.\u201dIn fact, Arin did not like Seivan Marcos. To the reader, Arin, Seiven was like a bully who kept flirting with her favorite character.\u201cEven though I know he turned you down.\u201dSeivan Marcos grinned as if he is having fun.\u201cDo you often hear that you hit the bone with the facts?\u201d\u201cSometimes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a type to be hated.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of yourself?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you thought of me as a twisted pervert sometime ago?\u201dViola grinned.\u201cIf you are simply a twisted pervert, he wouldn\u2019t have put your neck on the guillotine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know the reason why you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think, princess?\u201d\u201cBecause you are useful.\u201dIn the original novel, Seivan Marcos always does his best. He was afraid of the day when the duke didn\u2019t need him anymore, so he constantly tried to get out of his sight.[ \u201cIf the moment comes when he doesn\u2019t need me, I\u2019ll become relentless.\u201d ]And so, Seivan managed to live his life like a dog.He did his very best.The life of trying and pleasing truly equates to the effort of Seivan Marcos. That was his life. ]\u201cI think you are a useful person.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying so.\u201dHe continued his words. \u201cyou actually thought that way\u2026 I wish I could be useful.\u201dSeivan bent down.I couldn\u2019t clearly see his face because he was bending his neck down.Seivan was smiling.\u2018I think you are a useful person.\u2019 Rather than comforting or making fun of the fact that he was different, this person recognized and respected him.Arin, who was a devoted reader, grasped it and shook Seivan\u2019s heart. On the other hand. Viola\u2019s words were rather fishy to his ears.\u2018I wish I could be useful now.\u2019Intrigued, he asked. \u201cPrincess, you are seven years old, right?\u2019He seemed to have an insight into the nature of this little girl.Seivan slowly rised up again. Then, laughter leaked out of his mouth. Just now, he remembered what Viola had said.\u201cHence, it\u2019s not normal for you to squeeze yourself between their vows and beg for my father\u2019s love.\u201dNo one had ever said these kinds of things to him before.It was as if he had a mental illness and blamed him for something breaking down. It\u2019s like he\u2019s whispering behind his back.\u201cThat\u2019s very good advice, princess.\u201dNo one has pointed out the courtship of a married man. If he were a woman, he would probably have been criticized by the world. It was natural to say that he was making fun of married men.However, Seivan was always attacked and criticized for different reasons. And this seven years old princess pointed it out. She said something very natural and very obvious to him, the way that no one was able to, though he is very pleased with their small talk. The princess frowned slightly.\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Abruptly, Seivan suggested.\u201cAt tomorrow\u2019s welcome dinner, can I put on your makeup?\u201d\u201cYou? Why?\u201d\u201cYou said I\u2019m a useful person. I\u2019ll show you what I can do. I\u2019d love to. I\u2019ll make you shine more than anyone else.\u201dAt the moment, Viola was able to tell what was going to happen next.\u2018I\u2019m scared.\u2019That look wasn\u2019t normal. It was the mad artist\u2019s eyes. Seivan\u2019s eyes slowly drew a half moon. He looked rather drunk. Then, he stretched his arm high. Obsession and madness flashed in his eyes.\u201cYour beauty is more arrogant than anyone else, but also more brilliant as well.\u201dI had a bad feeling about this.\u201cThe little eyes of the princess will be all the more sensational.\u201d\u2018\u2026Is it really like that?\u2019 I had never thought that way. And surely, things seemed to be getting worse.\u201cA cold look of pride and arrogance combined with the magic of color will add to the ferocity of the beast.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHis grin went wider.\u201cYou resemble a deadly lily with a poisonous thorn. I\u2019ll make you a ruler who outshines anyone else.\u201dWait a minute.Isn\u2019t that too grand?\u201cWith the vastness of a tidal wave that does not fluctuate but devours everything.\u201dViola couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying anymore.Nonetheless, she realized one thing. He was in between the line containing the artistic soul of the mad artist.\u201cYou want it, don\u2019t you?\u201dStudying Seivan\u2019s eyes, it contained a great deal of madness.\u2018I didn\u2019t think I should say no.\u2019The moment she said no, he would have said, \u201cWhy are you rejecting me! You told me to do your best! You told me to try! You told me to be a useful person!\u201d It seemed as though he was going to flip her eyes and rush in with a knife at any moment.\u2018Oh, that\u2019s scary!\u2019 She hid her innermost thoughts desperately.He smirked on purpose.\u201cI am looking forward to it.\u201dUnder the long dress, her hidden legs trembled.***Laying in bed, Viola kicked several times in the air.\u2018Ugh!\u2019Not this person. Transformation genius. Master of disguise. Seivan\u2019s ability to create something out of nothing was brilliant.Viola already had a bad feeling about this.It was not just makeup. As Seivan mentioned before, he had the ability to transform the atmosphere as well. It was clear that the makeup magic would be discreet so that the atmosphere could be roughly permeated.\u2018I\u2019m screwed.\u2019 Knowing her fate, Viola quickly realized that she was doomed.Then, she jumped up swiftly and stood in front of the mirror.\u2018I really am pretty.\u2019Pretty. Cute. Those words weren\u2019t far off.However, after that beauty, there was an aura that could be ambiguously described in words.Ominous and shady.It was quite difficult to explain, like a prospective killer, like a dreamer.\u2018I look like a pretty unlucky woman in a horror movie\u2026\u2019 She was beautiful, but it felt as if there would be a gloomy background music whenever she appeared.On purpose, she put more pressure on her eyes, then laughed. As Seivan said, she did look arrogant and prideful. There was a peculiar atmosphere which she had. So, this unique atmosphere would only intensify when Seivan got her makeup done.\u2018Sigh. It\u2019ll be okay right?\u2019Then, someone tapped on her shoulder when she was lost in thoughts.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dVixen backed away in a hurry. His movement was like a quick weasel.\u201cHehe. That is not good.\u201dViola wanted to cry at the moment. \u2018Why is there a knife in my hand\u2026?\u2019There was a dagger in the air.Verratoux\u2019s successors carry weapons somewhere in their bodies. Most of them were in the form of daggers for easy carrying. The same goes for Viola, as she wore a dagger around her thigh.\u2018Did I just swing the knife?\u2019It happened in the blink of an eye. While looking in the mirror, bewildered, Vixen spoke, \u201cIt seemed that Viola is acting.\u201d\u201cHehe. Calm down. It\u2019s a knife, not a sword.\u201dHis eyes narrowed down. It seemed as though opposite to Viola, Vixen had found this rather exciting.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a knife. It really is a knife.\u201dA cold sweat ran down Viola\u2019s back.\u2018If he really is Vixen that I know\u2026\u2019 He would say something like, \u2018All right, let\u2019s have a sword fight together! I\u2019m excited!\u2019 and this character would take out the dagger and swung it in a heartbeat.\u2018Huh?\u2019But he didn\u2019t.\u2018He is still standing still.\u2019 Vixen didn\u2019t seem to care about the thought of wielding a knife in the slightest. Viola wasn\u2019t sure if it was good or not, but he had been a little cautious today.Then, Vixen, who was a little modest today, asked with a bright smile.\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\u201cI was just looking in the mirror.\u201d\u201cWhy? You got a princess disease?\u201dPerhaps the eight years old Vixen, when he stared at the mirror, seemed to think that he was a princess. Viola frowned at his words slightly.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hurt.\u201d He then proceeded to point to his knee.\u201cI had one, too.\u201dSurprisingly, she also had a wound on her knee as well though it wasn\u2019t big or anything.\u201cWhat? Does it hurt a lot?\u201dHe used to say it didn\u2019t hurt even if he got stabbed, so what\u2019s wrong with him worrying about small stuff like this now? Vixen spoke confidently with a look as he became more serious.\u201cApply some ointment, and for me as well.\u201d\u201cWhy would I?\u201d\u201cHey, doesn\u2019t Viola apply ointment?\u201d\u201cApply it yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never put it on myself. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\u201cThen, ask your butler.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201dVixen proudly extended the ointment.\u201cHere. Here.\u201dViola would lie if she said he wasn\u2019t scary at all, but he still had some cute sides. Right now, he just looked like an eight years old child asking for medicine. Well, he was still a little boy. However, nothing is free. If she ended up doing everything he asked for, he would be incredibly spoiled.Viola asked. \u201cWhat are you going to do for me, then?\u201d\u201cDo I have to do something?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cThen, I won\u2019t put the ointment on for you.\u201dHearing so, Vixen pouted his lips.\u2018Hm, well, I\u2019m just going to put that on my wound first.\u2019 And swiftly, Viola turned her back towards him moments later.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\u201cDo me a favor later.\u201d\u201cFavor?\u201d He scratched his head confusingly.Vixen thought about it for a moment. If it was a favor, he thought it shouldn\u2019t be something too grand.After seeing him being somewhat swayed by the thought, Viola didn\u2019t miss the timing and opened the ointment lid. She then scooped out some ointment with her fingers and teasingly moved her hand to the left and right. Vixen\u2019s eyes moved along with the movement as well. He had the eyes of a dog chasing a snack while wagging its tail gently.\u201cWell, here.\u201d Smiling proudly, she stuck out a paper.\u201cCome on. Sign here.\u201d\u201cSign?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll apply some medicine for you if you sign.\u201dA contract was very important. Once I applied it for him, he was going to make my wish come true. It would be a very profitable business.\u201cHere\u2019s a pe-\u2026\u201dShe was planning to hand him a pen, but Vixen didn\u2019t wait. After biting his index finger, he signed the paper with the blood dripping.\u2018Wah, I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2019He was out of his mind. Viola hurriedly bowed her head to hide her surprised look. Hiding her trembling heart, she applied the ointment at his knee.\u201cUgh! T-that stings! Apply it gently!\u201dVixen gave a big blow, but fortunately, Viola was done applying it.He stood in a huddle and mumbled. \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you not going to apply it here, too? Hehe.\u201d He then brought out his index finger towards her.\u201cPut some here as well. See, it\u2019s still bleeding.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s because you didn\u2019t choose to use a pen like a normal person and just bit your finger\u2026 Ah, I guess his obsession with ointment is much worse than I thought.\u2019\u201cYou know, Viola.\u201d Peering at me, it seemed that he was thinking hard about something.Instinctively, Viola had a strange feeling that he didn\u2019t want to leave this room. It looked as though he was trying to find a reason to stay. However, no matter how hard he thought about it, there was no legitimate reason, so he just blurted whatever came to his mind.\u201cDid you know that I\u2019m jealous of you?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause you have a welcome dinner.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re jealous of that?\u201d\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t have that.\u201dWell, of course, that would be the case. Vixen was born a Verratoux. Thus, there was no welcome dinner because he wasn\u2019t adopted.\u201cI\u2019m told not to say anything. They just want me to eat, that\u2019s all.\u201dViola realized this. If siblings didn\u2019t say anything at the welcome dinner, she should just be on her best manners. The main characters of the reception are Duke Heron, Duchess Isabelle, and Viola.\u2018Because it\u2019s not just a welcoming dinner.\u2019If it were a real \u2018welcome dinner,\u2019 family members would greet each other, familiarize each other\u2019s faces, and have a good time. Although Viola wasn\u2019t sure if that would be the case here.The actual title of this scene in the novel was \u201cThe Duchy\u2019s Cruel Test.\u201d This was a place to evaluate and test Viola\u2019s qualifications as a Verratoux.\u201cBrother, we would only be eating.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d Vixen became sullen.\u201cSo, let\u2019s have fun next time.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dHe then raised his pinky eagerly.\u201cYou promise to do something fun with me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAll right. Keep your promise, okay?\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d Vixen, who was fully energized, went outside with a grin.In an instant, he acted like a good child again.It had been a day like that.***It was four A.M.Xenon woke up Viola.\u201cPrincess?\u201dShe sleepily murmured unconsciously.\u201c\u2026I want to sleep.\u201d\u2018Hmm, mmm.\u2019 Viola squirmed as if she was eating something in her dreams. Xenon glanced back at his watch before staring back at Viola, who had fallen back asleep already.\u201cOne more minute\u2026\u201dAfter hearing her mumbled, he watched her for a moment with warm eyes and stood up. \u2018Five. Four. Three. Two. One.\u2019 Exactly a minute had passed, and it was time for him to wake her up.\u201cPrincess?\u201dHe bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m going to need to shake you a little.\u201d Xenon touched her shoulder and shook her lightly, attempting to wake her up. At that moment, Viola\u2019s pocket knife flew towards his neck.\u201cEutcha!\u201d [ Sound effect for getting up. ]He swiftly avoided the blade. Manna was still embedded in her hand. Murmuring, he said, \u201cShe\u2019ll cut a thin steel plate in half without difficulty\u2026\u201dThen, Xenon tried to wake her up again as if nothing had happened.\u201cPrincess, you have to get up, okay?\u201dEventually, Viola finally woke up. She had no recognition that she had swung the blade unconsciously.\u201cIt\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning, Xenon.\u201d\u2018Are you crazy? Why did he wake me up at four A.M.?\u2019\u201cYou have to get ready.\u201dShe repeated annoyingly, \u201cIt\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\u201cThe welcome dinner is scheduled at nine A.M.\u201d\u201cI know, but it\u2019s still four in the morning!\u201d\u2018The welcome dinner is at nine. So, why do you wake me up at four A.M.? Does he really want to die?\u2019 Viola\u2019s eyes were filled with rage.Xenon grinned.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. I know the princess is still sleepy, but please get up.\u201dHe supported Viola on her back and raised her. \u2018Oh, I\u2019m still sleepy. I want to sleep some more\u2026\u2019 Her seven years old body was too fragile to overcome the desire to sleep.\u2018Sleepy.\u2019Unknowingly, her eyes were slowly shutting. Viola could feel her body being moved, but it felt as though she was still dreaming. Seeing so, Xenon grinned and spoke.\u201cDid you know that my carotid artery almost got cut open, princess?\u201dHe protested. Xenon grabbed her wrist that was falling while carrying her and placed it on top of Viola again.\u201cI apologize for waking you up early, but you don\u2019t have to attack my throat, all right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh.\u201d\u2018I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019This was the second time that her body moved on its own. Even though Viola wanted to say that, she couldn\u2019t. Sleepy, she kept dozing off.\u201cNext time, turn the angle to the left about three degrees.\u201dXenon smiled and pointed at his shoulder muscles. \u201cIf you relax and swing here, your chances of killing someone will increase by more than ten percent.\u201dViola lifted her body up from his arms carefully.\u201cSir Seivan is waiting.\u201dNod, nod. Couldn\u2019t beat the tiredness, she kept dozing off and couldn\u2019t remember exactly what had happened after. Sleeping through the entire process, the maids were giving her baths filled with spices while massaging her, then dressed her up in fancy dresses.\u2018Ah, it\u2019s eight thirty A.M.\u2019It was eight thirty. At this point, she was slowly coming to her senses, and she was all ready. Viola, who was mostly asleep the whole time, had nothing to feel uncomfortable about. When she opened her eyes, most of the preparations were finished.Arin, who is most bothered by the cold and dry hair in this world, experienced unexpected convenience from it.Then, a voice resounded.\u201cYou are so beautiful, princess. You are more elegant and beautiful than any other seven years old kids I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThe voice was definitely Seivan, but the interesting fact was that his face was different. And Viola knew exactly why. \u2018He\u2019s a masquerader who creates and puts on the masks out of the faces of the bodies he had killed..\u2019 When Viola recalled that fact, a cold sweat flowed down her back.He shuddered.\u201cAt this point, I felt a little bit out of breath. I think it\u2019s safe to say that you have Duke Heron\u2019s blood.\u201dThe mere thought of the duke made him excited.Seivan\u2019s reflection in the mirror smiled brightly. Wondering, she could see a slight scar near his neck, though it looked somewhat like a scratch.\u201cPrincess, could you put the scissors down?\u201dWithout realizing, she saw a scissor in her hand.This wasn\u2019t the first time she heard these words? Why were her shoulders so stiff, as if she was swinging something way too much?\u201cI almost died three times.\u201dSeivan just simply laughed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she fails this test, Viola would be discarded without any hesitation.\u2018Phew.\u2019While I was breathing deeply, the large door opened wide, and she slowly got a glimpse of people who were inside. Viola moved solemnly with Xenon behind her.\u201cThe Seventh Princess of the Verratoux Family. Young Lady Viola Verratoux enters.\u201dShe was called the seventh princess, not the Sixth Princess.Just like in the novel.Walking several steps further, she glanced to her right and stared at the butler who called her the Seventh Princess.In fact, the duke\u2019s test starts from here.Whether she would correct something that was wrong on the stop or not. If she gets it right and acts how \u2018a Verratoux should act,\u2019 then she would pass the first test.\u2018I can\u2019t do the same as Viola.\u2019In the original book, Viola moved swiftly and stabbed the butler in the neck. Sadly, she couldn\u2019t make the same move as her. If she followed her actions from the novel, she could have exposed unwanted loopholes.So, instead, she chose a different method.Choosing a method she could do better.Step by step.The sound of Viola\u2019s footsteps echoed in the silence. Slowly, she approached the butler. As the original story went, she had to kill that butler, but she decided to twist the original plot a little.\u2018That\u2019s not a real butler.\u2019It is not a real person. It is a doll strung by a puppeteer.[ The fourth finger of the butler\u2019s left hand had a thin thread attached to it. \u300dA very fine, shiny thread could be seen. Viola stood before him silently. She slowly took out the dagger from her arms and swung it very leisurely with a nonchalant attitude.The dagger given to her was from Verratoux. The special dagger was made by the duke\u2019s workshop to fit her wistful spirit for its\u2019 high quality. Although it was a rough-and-dull dagger, it was not impossible to break the thread.Swish! The thread broke, and the butler doll lost its strength and collapsed.Viola wasn\u2019t too surprised to know it was a doll. \u2018Now, we can step on that head.\u2019 It was difficult to trample on people, though it was not that difficult to trample on dolls.Step!Viola deliberately put her foot on the butler\u2019s head. She trampled on it slowly. She practiced really hard while looking at the mirror last night.Smile.\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s not fun at all.\u201dThe man rolled up his lips and laughed, hiding the tension with laughter. She peered at the man.\u201cSavann Marcos.\u201d[ The person who manipulated the doll was the puppeteer, Savann Marcos. \u300dShe could feel the tension from his stare. All the other family members, except Viola, are sitting at the long table.Duke Heron Verratoux.Duchess Isabella.And the eyes of her five siblings could be visibly felt at once, too. With all the pressure, Viola seriously wanted to cry. \u2018Wow. This is too much for me.\u2019 Among all the stares, it was difficult to differentiate whose eyes were a violent, wild animal.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t even look over there.\u2019So, she decided not to look at them on purpose. There is no need to talk with her siblings, anyway. Today\u2019s scene is about the Duke, Duchess Isabella, and of course, Viola. Us three were the main characters.Viola decided to concentrate on that fact instead. Then, Savaan approached.\u201cUhm.\u201dHe walked a few more steps closer, covering his mouth with his hands and laughing. Savann, who came in front of Viola, bent down.\u201cI have made a mistake, princess.\u201d\u201cI guess you know it was a bad call.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re really sorry, would you like to die for your mistake?\u201d Viola pretended to hold her dagger tighter and smirked.Savann shook his hand.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much of a felony. Ho, ho, ho. Please look over here.\u201dSavann pointed at his neck, which fine wounds were visible. They were wounds inflicted by the scissors that Viola had wielded in her sleep.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you say that I\u2019ve been charged already? I almost died.\u201dSavann Marcos looked toward the Duke. Viola unknowingly followed his gaze as well. She gave the Duke a single glance.Viola was a kid whom he, the owner of a winter castle, had adopted himself. The handsome man had black bangs and captivating eyes, to say that he was handsome was an understatement. Her perspective was rather a deep affinity for the duke.\u2018Isn\u2019t that a fraud to look that good even though it\u2019s a novel?\u2019That face contained immunity for anyone to forgive him of all wrongdoings.Han Arin felt that his father\u2019s appearance is more improbable than her own thought of the novel. There\u2019s no such father in the present world.\u201cYou\u2019re so handsome, Duke.\u201dHeron read Viola\u2019s feelings through the novel as \u2018twisted.\u2019[ T/N: It is expressed as a Jin-an, which is not a proper word for Jin-mu which means twisted, in the basic hanja (\u93ad\u64ab). The meaning is \u201cCalm and caress the people who caused the chaos.\u201d ]She tried to ignore the good feelings that were forming. This warm feeling didn\u2019t suit Verratoux.The duke then spoke in a grave voice.\u201cViola, stop and sit down.\u201dShe turned away. Gently and carefully, Viola walked towards her seat. She then put the dagger back in her arms and held the hem on both sides of her dress. Along her steps, she could feel the eyes of her siblings. Vixen\u2019s expression is also full of excitement.\u201cPhew\u201dThis is the real beginning.***Viola glanced around the area once.It was a long rectangular table. Her five siblings are sitting around the table, but she decided to not care about that for now. Because regardless, they are just spectators in this chapter. Though Viola couldn\u2019t deny that she felt scared from their gazes for a while now.Xenon pulled up the chair for her.\u201cYou can sit here, princess.\u201dHer seat is facing Duke Heron and Duchess Isabella. At the rectangular edge, this is the seat of the main characters.Duchess Isabella was wearing a white veil, so her face was not visible.Viola knew how to proceed to the next step in this novel. Isabella will first throw a test disguised as a question.[ \u201cSixth Princess. I have two questions.\u201d \u300dSo, Viola planned to take the first step first. She had to get her act together first to ensure that she had an advantage. Han Arin, who is now Viola, is not the real Viola, so she had to do her best to survive.Viola spoke with a relaxed smile.\u201cI don\u2019t think that you have the atmosphere to welcome me.\u201dShe glanced around on purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s my father\u2019s impulsiveness that brought me here unilaterally.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTo verify my eligibility as a Verratoux.\u201dViola looked into Isabella\u2019s eyes that were hidden by the veil.\u201cWe\u2019ll need verification from two other owners of this family.\u201dTwo other owners.It means two duchesses. However, another one is not here.The other duchess did not appear in the novel, though she was only roughly mentioned. So, the only duchess left is Duchess Isabella.\u201cBecause another person is not here, Duchess Isabella will test me, right?\u201dHan Arin couldn\u2019t do it like how Viola did it in the novel. She doesn\u2019t want to die, nor kill anyone. Her movements are not sharp, and she didn\u2019t have a cruel personality like Viola. That\u2019s why she chose to do this.\u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can prove your physical ability, you must prove your worth with your mentally.\u201dIf she couldn\u2019t prove that she has the qualification, she\u2019ll die. Fortunately, Han Arin already knew the story of the novel \u300c Shadow of Verratoux. \u300dDuchess Isabella\u2019s red lips continued to move.\u201cBut you\u2019re right. That was brilliant, Sixth Princess.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment. So, what\u2019s the test?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you two questions.\u201dThe examination began.\u201cFirst. Why didn\u2019t you stab him in the heart?\u201dShe added, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill the butler (doll) who called the Sixth Princess.\u201d, the Seventh Princess?\u201dViola frowned on purpose.\u201cIs that a question?\u201dIt was as though she was indicating,\u2018is that all you could think of asking me?\u2019 Her tone was sarcastic, too. Duchess Isabella was briefly taken aback by Viola\u2019s attitude.\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201dThe family\u2019s eyes widened in unison.\u2018I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared!\u2019 Even though she was terrified inside, Viola kept staring at Duchess Isabella on purpose. Thankfully, with the veil covering Duchess Isabella\u2019s eyes, they were not very visible and it made Viola less nervous. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ll just look at Isabella.\u2019 And so, she did that.It seemed to others that Viola is not at all daunted by Isabella. She did not even pay the slightest attention to her siblings, but is relaxed while dealing with Isabella. Savann\u2019s makeup also had a helping hand of completely concealed her fear from showing, too.Isabelle smiled lightly.\u201cI\u2019ve been tasked by the duke to ask questions. Did you have to tarnish me like that?\u201d\u201cNo, it was not my intention to do that at all.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cYou asked me something that was so obvious that I was just genuinely confused whether it was a serious question or not.\u201dViola was getting nervous again, so she quickly continued the conversation. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, but I apologize if you felt that way.\u201d\u2018I should just smirk at this point, right?\u2019Smirk. Thinking so, she proceeded to smile softly.The reception hall was tranquil. Only the sounds of Isabella and Viola\u2019s conversation filled the dining hall.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again. The reason you didn\u2019t stab the butler in the heart is because you noticed he was a doll?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d\u201cIt is a welcoming dinner with my family and my closest friends.\u201dI glanced around the room. \u201cBut there was one person who\u2019s not a part of the people that I just mentioned.\u201dAlthough Savann Marcos is an important person and close aide to the duke, he was hardly considered as the closest person in this circle to join her welcoming dinner. There were only personal butlers of Verratoux\u2019s immediate family.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that I am the Sixth Princess, so if he calls me the Seventh Princess, then it meant you want me to kill him, right?\u201dShe then laughed sensibly deliberately.\u201cBut this is a place where the absolute laws of Winter Castle apply, so I shouldn\u2019t kill him. And that left me with one answer. Is that right, mother?\u201d\u201cKeep talking.\u201d\u201cSo, someone who was closest to him would be suspected as the one who manipulated the doll. It was obvious that Savann Marcos, the puppeteer of Winter Castle, would be the culprit.\u201dViola continued as if she had seen through everything.\u201cBut here, Savann Marcos couldn\u2019t have been dogmatic without father\u2019s permission, So, in other words, his actions would have been following father\u2019s and mother\u2019s orders.\u201dHe looked toward Savann Marcos.*** Visit website Zinnovel.com to read latest chapter ***She peered at Savann Marcos and concluded her words. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t kill him. Is my explanation enough, mother?\u201dThere was a moment of silence.\u2026Why?Why is it so quiet?\u2018Did I make a mistake? Did I talk too much? Should I have just stabbed the butler in the neck like the original Viola?\u2019At that moment, Duke Heron Verratoux broke the silence and threw a heavy word.\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned towards him. Their eyes were filled with wonder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Played the Role of the Adopted Daughter Too WellChapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25Duchess Isabella bit her lip slightly.It was something that was way beyond her expectations.How should she put it\u2026?It felt like she was beaten.\u2018In that short amount of time, she knew everything even though she only heard the word \u201cSeventh Princess\u201d?\u2019To be honest, she had somewhat expected Viola\u2019s reactions. For instance, she expected her to probably stab the doll butler. Though instead, Viola\u2019s response far exceeded her expectations\u2014not only that she didn\u2019t stab the doll, she chose to cut the thread instead as if she had known everything.That wasn\u2019t the end.She even guessed the identity of the person controlling the doll at once. Viola figured it all out too accurately.\u201cShe was born with\u2026 an unbelievable insight.\u201dThe situation was shocking.Moreover, Viola is only seven years old.\u2018That child is dangerous..\u2019How can a seven years old know this much? In addition, Duke Heron even praised her as \u2018great.\u2019 In fact, to be honest, that was the most shocking thing of all.Duchess Isabella looked at the Duke.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you complimented me.\u201d\u201cWell, you did something to be praised.\u201dAgain, the silence fell.Of all the Duke\u2019s five children, only the First Princess heard his praise once in a while. Duke Heron is rather stingy in giving praises\u2026 But, he complimented Viola, especially, in the presence of all the other families gathered.It was very significant.Although she was the last to jump into the race for succession, now, she was starting with an advantage.The Duchess asked again.\u201cIsn\u2019t the second question meaningless, you said?\u201d\u201cDo as you wish. The two questions are the Duchess\u2019 rights.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve already praised me, so I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\u2018It shouldn\u2019t end like this.\u2019So, Viola answered nonchalantly.\u201cThough\u2026 the second question is obvious.\u201d\u2026Because she knows everything from the novel.She continued her words, \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of why, how dare you, wield a weapon in front of the Duke and the Duchess?\u201dAnd so, Viola did her best to answer all the questions without showing any nervousness.At the moment, silence, once again, filled the dining hall.It was because all of her words were correct.Isabella was speechless at the moment. She didn\u2019t expect the little princess to have come this far.\u2018What answer will she reply to that question\u2026?\u2019The thought that she shouldn\u2019t have asked those questions aroused in Isabella\u2019s mind for no reason.Duke Heron finally spoke again. His gaze did not fall from Viola.The way she looks right now\u2026She\u2019s acting like Verratoux. Not once did she avoid Isabella\u2019s gaze. More importantly, Viola was not showing signs of falling behind Isabella but rather, showing the lead.Viola\u2019s actions and thoughts are more like Verratoux than anyone else, which was a praiseworthy attitude and behavior.\u2018But, why am I?\u2019He didn\u2019t feel very well.Viola was now looking more Verratoux than anyone else.As Xenon said, perhaps this child would show an \u2018advanced Verratoux.\u2019It was a good thing.Still, strangely, he felt bad\u2026\u201cFeel free!\u201dThe little girl who said \u2018feel free!\u2019 came to mind again. The hand that held out the egg tart came to mind again\u2014The little child with that hand looked at himself with eyes full of affection.\u2018Love for no reason. Blind favorability towards me.\u2019It was read in the duke\u2019s Sincere Eye.\u2018\u2026It\u2019s a good feeling that I\u2019ve never felt for a long time.\u2019The most Verratoux.It was still not clear why that thoroughly calculating child has such illogical affinity.\u2018And, the weirdest thing is\u2026\u2019That blind and strange favor wasn\u2019t that bad. In his life as Duke of Verratoux, he had never received such \u2018love without reason.\u2019 The answer was simple, it was because everyone who ever showed favor to the Duke always had some ulterior reason.Whatever it may be, that child had no such reason.\u2018Fear me, yet love me.\u2019Still, he didn\u2019t hate it.That was the very first unfamiliar feeling that he felt for the first time while reigning as the Lord of the Winter Castle and Duke Verratoux.\u2018Why do I feel\u2026 Isn\u2019t that bad?\u2019The Duke kept a straight face and tried to correct his thoughts.\u2018\u2026No, she\u2019s Veratoux. So, I am just in a good mood. It has nothing to do with that child\u2019s unfamiliar feelings.\u2019Adopting a child that is More Verratoux than anyone else meant that she was of Veratoux achievements.With those thoughts, his eyes sank deeply.Meanwhile, reading his deep look, it seemed that Isabella had misunderstood the Duke\u2019s state of mind.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect you to be so deeply pleased.\u2019If Viola was seventeen, not seven, it might have had a huge impact on the succession structure. So, it was quite fortunate that she is only seven years old.It wasn\u2019t long before Duke Heron eventually opened his mouth.\u201cBring in the welcome gift.\u201dKnock, knock.After his words, there was a knock, and a man with gray hair and full of scars on his face appeared. It was Carlton, the butler.He bent down politely.\u201cI am Butler Carlton. Greetings to you.\u201dThere was a tray in his right hand.Five potion bottles with different colors of liquid could be seen. The contents of the novel came to Viola\u2019s mind.\u300c The last test of the duke was \u2018the ability to doubt\u2019 and \u2018the wick that should not obey authority.\u2019 \u300d[\u00a0<b>T/N:</b>\u00a0The last phrase represents Viola to be a person who shouldn\u2019t do the things that they want her to do. Since she is being tested, she should do something that is out of the basket and what they want her to do. The original Viola did so in the original novel, but Arin did something different that the Duchess was so surprised since she expected that Viola would do something like the Viola from the original novel to do\u2014The wick or the candlewick in the phrase is a representation of a single person. ]All five bottles are poison.They are all deadly, poisonous poisons that, if she drinks it, she would undoubtedly die soon after. In other words, she shouldn\u2019t drink anything.If in the original story, Duchess Isabella said,\u300c \u201cCome on, Viola. For you to become my youngest daughter, I have a present for you.\u201d\u201cThose liquids?\u201d\u201cThey all have different effects, but they\u2019re potions made up of elixirs that are very good for Viola\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cWhy should I drink such things?\u201d \u300dThe original viola drops the tray itself to the ground and continues in a harsh manner.\u300c \u201cWhy does it feel like I\u2019m being tested?\u201d\u201cIt was the Duke who brought me without even asking my opinion.\u201d \u300dViola, in the original novel, exudes relentless murderous energy toward the Duke. Then, like the female lead, she said some big, crazy words.\u300c \u201cIf I were stronger than you, I would have cut you down here and now.\u201d \u300dFortunately, she was the main character, or else she would have been in huge trouble.Once again, Viola decided to do things a little differently. Something more like Han Arin.\u201cSince it\u2019s a gift for me, thank you.\u201dCarlton, the butler, came closer. He then bent his back and knees down to match Viola\u2019s height.\u201cWhat color of the elixir will the Princess take?\u201dCarlton grinned. It seemed as though he was just a nice old man.However, she knew everything already.In fact, Carlton was from a very famous assassin in the past. He was a man who failed to kill Duke Heron, but became his servant. And now, he became Duke Heron\u2019s most trusted loyal butler.Viola said to her father, who was sitting far away.Although she had to raise her voice since he was quite far away.\u201cFrom the time you called me the Seven Princess. It was already obvious that this was not a welcome dinner, but a place to test Viola Verratoux\u2019s qualifications.\u201dViola, in the original story, overturned this place. She made a strong impression, so to speak, by speaking up big words. Han Arin decided to take the wiser approach.She laughed on purpose.\u201cI think you wanted to know what you can expect from Viola Verratoux.\u201dSmirking slightly, she slowly lifted a bottle of red liquid\u2026 and dropped it to the ground in a flash.Clang!The potion bottle broke with a loud noise.The original Viola destroyed the entire tray, though Han Arin broke only one.\u201cDo you really expect me to drink this?\u201dThe red liquid splashed all over the place. A few drops splashed onto Viola\u2019s feet.Oh, my God! Oh, it\u2019s hot!\u2018Ah, I thought my feet were burning\u2026\u2019Viola managed to maintain a serene expression.\u201cAnyone who has Verratoux\u2019s last name should be suspicious of everyone except themselves. I must say that is really true.\u201dDuchess Isabella nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good advice. Who told you that?\u201d\u201cMy butler.\u201d\u201cYou have a good butler.\u201dXenon, not too agitated, bent down next to Viola and wiped the broken pieces of the potion bottle. He lowered his face and cleaned up the glass shards, so she couldn\u2019t really see his face. Meanwhile, an ointment was taken out of his arms and slightly applied to Viola\u2019s shin. His touch when he was applying ointment was gentle and delicate.Viola lifted a bottle of purple liquid.\u201cThough\u2026 somehow this scent smells nostalgic. As if there\u2019s a special story behind it.\u201dShe could see it.Duke Heron flinched very slightly.She knew exactly why. That was because the purple potion is related to Heron\u2019s only beloved wife, Rael.\u300c \u201cShall we open it?\u201d \u300dTo survive in this wild jungle, Viola decided to throw her gamble.Duke Heron had a woman he loved dearly.She died fifteen years ago.Even though it did not actually appear in the story, Duke Heron would sit in a blue moonlit study room and murmur her name all by himself.\u300c \u201cHer name is Rael.\u201d \u300dShe was a very good alchemist and potion maker. Tea was also one of her well-known works. And so, she was called the Water Magician.\u300c The day she died, Rael smiled faintly and murmured.\u201cMy lonely man. I want to be with you forever.\u201d \u300dShe fell ill and died. It was stated that she had a rare disease.\u300c \u201cI made a purple potion name \u2018Viola.\u2019\u201d \u300dThe character, \u2018Viola,\u2019 was named after this potion.Just before she died, she handed the potion \u2018Viola\u2019 to the Duke.\u300c \u201cIf you drink this, you\u2019ll die, too.\u201d\u201cMy lonely man. Come with me to a warm place.\u201d\u201cIt hurts less if we die together.\u201d \u300dDuke Heron, who loved his wife, Rael, so much, almost wanted to commit suicide and drank the poison to be with her. However, his butler, Carlton, was the one who stopped him.\u2018Anyway, it was a world view wherein there is no single sane person\u2026\u2019A woman who gave poison to her husband to kill himself, and a husband who willingly accepted it. Her husband even named his adopted daughter after the poison.\u2018Nothing seems to be normal in this story.\u2019It is once again clear how mindless and insane this world is.Duke Heron asked.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s poison.\u201dSaying so, Viola shook the glass bottle a little. The liquid, like grape juice, was glistening.\u201c\u2026I want to try this for some reason.\u201dBecause of that, Xenon whispered in her ear.\u201cPrincess? That\u2019s the most poisonous one of the five potions.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dViola chuckled.*** Visit website Zinnovel.com to read latest chapter ***Of course, it felt like she was going to die. Still, even if she decided to throw a gamble, that didn\u2019t mean she felt comfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s calling me, somehow\u2026 it sounded like a woman\u2019s voice?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the original storyline, Viola drank the \u2018Viola potion.\u2019 She deliberately drank the potion, wondering what could have happened to her. Thankfully, Viola didn\u2019t die after drinking the potion.Even Viola, who had the guts, was bewildered. She vividly recalled the scene in her mind with embarrassment.\u300c Why is everything alright? \u300dLater on, she finally realized the reason.\u300c Viola has an unusual body condition that \u2018Viola potion\u2019\u2019 did not work on her. \u300dSo, she decided to trust the setting set by the author.Among all the five potions, she decided to drink the most poisonous one. To make the strongest impression in front of them.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m not going to die, am I?\u2019It would be a lie to say that she is not afraid.\u2018But I have to.\u2019She needs to get a perfect head start. It was not possible to survive in this Duchy of Verratoux with a half-hearted attitude.She had come this far, all she had to do was to go straight ahead.\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll have a drink now, my dear family.\u201dViola put her nose in the vial\u2019s mouth. The scent is surprisingly good. She could smell something sweet, like wine.\u201cWho made this potion?\u201dDespite knowing everything, she still asked.\u201cWhy are nostalgic feelings dripping from this potion?\u201dAt that moment, silence fell.It was none other than Duke Heron who broke the heavy silence. He slowly rose from his seat and walked closer to Viola. His eyes did not contain any emotion, but Viola was able to read the violent spirit behind that stillness.The duke asked in a low tone.\u201cWhere and how did you hear that?\u201dViola hid her fear and acted.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear it, I saw it.\u201d\u201cYou saw it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I saw it.\u201d\u2018Well, I read it in the novel.\u2019\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\u201cA longingness for someone, love more than death, and desperate longing. I can see that.\u201dAfter hearing the words, Duke Heron stared intently at Viola. Viola started shrinking for no reason.\u2018I felt strange\u2026 \u2018It was as if the eyes were searching for all the secrets that were hidden, beyond the memories, even the ones she didn\u2019t know.\u300c Duke Heron had very special eyes. He had an instinctive insight to distinguish between lies and truth. \u300dIt is called\u00a0<b>\u2018eye of the truth\u2019</b>\u00a0in the novel.\u2018Because of this eye, Duke Heron will be even more confused.\u2019Because, Viola was only telling the truth.She then leaned the entrance of the potion Viola against her mouth.Gulp.The potion, \u2018Viola,\u2019 gradually seeped down her esophagus and entered her body. At that, Viola could immediately feel her body becoming hot. It was as if sweet sugar water seemed to rush towards all the blood vessels.Making a sticky fire.It\u2019s hot.Her whole body was incredibly hot.\u2018It feels like I am burning from head to toe. Am I really going to be okay\u2026?\u2019I\u2019m thirsty.Whatever it is, Viola was craving to drink anything. Abruptly, something came to her mind all of a sudden.\u2018\u2026Blood.\u2019The body of the million kills princess character wanted blood.\u2018Blood\u2026? What kind of blood is that?\u2019Of course, Viola doesn\u2019t want to drink blood. Just the thought of it already made her feel disgusted. So, she pondered deeply.\u2018Grapefruit juice, watermelon juice, orange juice\u2026\u2019Among them, the best is\u2026..\u2018Strawberry juice, no, strawberry milk!\u2019Strawberry syrup mixed with milk and sweet sugar.\u2018Oh, no. Wait\u2026 Soda water is better than milk.\u2019Then, it becomes a sweet and fresh strawberry ale.\u2018It would be enormous if you put a lot of ice on it!\u2019When she thought of strawberry ale, her thirst for blood subsided a little.At that moment, her eyes unintentionally turned red. Viola was now getting taken over by a spirit who desperately craved blood. It wasn\u2019t intended, but it is the setting value of the ten year old princess.Heron and Isabella, and all the siblings who saw felt the energy in person.Especially Isabella, who couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Viola. \u2018That\u2019s\u2026 a child born with the fate of the murder star.\u2019 She could visibly see those eyes longing for blood.Even though it shone strangely, it was also paradoxically beautiful and fascinating.That was the Viola that Isabella sees in front of her right now.Isabella, with her brilliant head, thought completely the opposite. \u2018She\u2019s truly greedy for blood, though she\u2019s controlling it with reason.\u2019Amazing insight.She had never seen anyone with better self-control than that.\u2018And she\u2019s doing it perfectly in front of us.\u2019The directing and situational application skills made her values stand out.\u201cThis is amusing. A rather amusing Verratoux has arrived.\u201d Duchess Isabella \u2018s lips formed a smirk.While Duke Heron was staring at Viola intently as well.\u00a0\u2018That little girl must have the ambition to devour Verratoux.\u2019\u00a0And here, she is showing her ambition without any hesitation.\u201cIf you\u2019re this determined, it feels like you\u2019re not going to hide your desire to be the ruler of Verratoux, right?\u201dThe action of that child is interpreted as a subtle and clever declaration of war.Well, of course not.Viola is just busy thinking of a sweet strawberry ale with ice floating on top. So, even though she was desiring blood, she wasn\u2019t controlling it with any particularly outstanding reasons.She just really didn\u2019t want blood.After a long while, the burning sensation that seemed to burn her whole body disappeared. And her thirst for blood gradually faded as well.\u2018Am I really fine now\u2026 right?\u2019It really is in accordance with the setting of the novel.\u201cAh, thank God\u2026\u201dFortunately, she is okay now. \u2018This gamble seemed to have worked out well.\u2019Smiling confidently, she raised up the empty glass bottle over her head. Not a drop fell.\u201cI drank it all.\u201dStill, none of the siblings made eye contact with her, feeling nervous and afraid.They only peered at Duchess Isabella, who was covering her face with a veil.Seeing the situation, I then picked up a fork and sat down.\u201cNow, shall we eat?\u201dStrange emotions filled Duke Heron\u2019s eyes as he saw his youngest daughter, who passed the test perfectly.\u2018Why am I not happy to face the perfect Verratoux? \u2026Why am I not satisfied?\u2019The thought caused complications in his mind. Unable to understand his own mind, Duke Heron remained silent and only glanced at Viola quietly.\u2018I don\u2019t like this.\u2019No matter how hard he stared at Viola, he couldn\u2019t figure out the answer.Meanwhile, Viola is finally able to be a little relieved.\u2018Duke Heron doesn\u2019t seem to be not interested.\u2019She was just glad. Those who are not interesting, would finally be forgotten.If she is forgotten, then one day, she will be hunted by her siblings.\u2018I think he\u2019s pretty satisfied.\u2019Viola could feel the duke\u2019s stares on her for quite a while.It\u2019s not just quite satisfactory. In fact, it\u2019s very satisfactory. \u2018She boasted that she saw through her favorite character\u2019s heart.The operation was successful.\u2018I\u2019ll just have to keep this up, then\u2026!\u2019Eventually, Duke Heron opened his mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dHearing this, Viola started slicing the steak that was cooked medium rare in front of her.Silence filled the dining room.Viola, who regained her composure with a brief sigh of relief, had to feel this breathtaking pressure again. She doesn\u2019t know if the steak is going into her mouth or nose at this point.\u2018It\u2019s too quiet!\u2019There were many people gathered, though all she could hear was a fork and a knife. The pressure, along with the silence, was so heavy that she couldn\u2019t breathe.She indeed was able to make a strong first impression.It is also clear that she succeeded in the first trial.So, now, no one is going to treat Viola recklessly. At the very least, no one seemed to have much to complain about her taking over Verratoux\u2019s last name. There won\u2019t be a big variable until the age of ten when she has to decide her career as a Verratoux.\u2018First of all, until I turn ten years old. I\u2019ll just have to survive well until then.\u2019If she is weak, she will be eaten.While munching on a steak pretending to be calm, Viola met eyes with another person. She was glaring at me all the way from the other side of the table, to the point where it felt rather rude.It was a girl with silver hair.Viola already knew who that silver-haired girl was.The older sister who will appear in the next chapter. Perhaps more than the male lead, Tundra, it should be Hera, the fourth princess who should be on her side unconditionally.Hera, the Fourth Princess.Hera had been lame since birth.And she is sitting in a wheelchair.She is a genius character who overcame physical disadvantages with her head. Later,they clashed with each other until Viola took over the supremacy.. Hera grew up to be a resourceful person for Duke Verratoux.Viola is also the opponent Very was quite picky about until the second half of the novel.\u2018When she becomes the enemy, she\u2019ll be the most troublesome sister.\u2019Besides, she\u2019s born as a giant. To put it simply, she is a loner. Still, there\u2019s no harm in being close to a rich person.\u2018We should be friends.\u2019Viola gazed back at her sister\u2019s face. Now that the welcome dinner is over, the episode of meeting Hera will begin soon.Since Hera was also looking at her. Their eyes met.Seeing so, Viola smiled back on purpose.\u00a0\u2018Let\u2019s be nice to her.\u2019\u00a0She realized that the best option is to get closer to Hera since she is going to be very rich and she is the biggest stock holder in this novel.Hera\u2019s face turned a little red when Viola and her eyes met.\u300c She then avoided eye contact. \u300dSo far, it is the same as the original.\u300c As Hera avoided her gaze. Since then, Viola has ignored Hera Verratoux. \u300dIn her eyes, young Hera is a coward or a loser who doesn\u2019t fit to be a Verratoux. So, Viola, in the original set-up, completely ignored Hera.In\u00a0<b>\u2018Meeting the Fourth Princess,\u2019</b>\u00a0which follows the next chapter of\u00a0<b>\u2018Welcome Dinner,\u2019</b>\u00a0Viola makes a disastrous mistake of kicking Hera away by ignoring her.\u300c When Hera came to see Viola, she chased her out with a single stroke.\u201cGet lost, before I kill you.\u201d \u300dThus, causing them to become enemies in the original novel.\u2018Well, that\u2019ll just create unnecessary enemies and tension for me.\u2019From the perspective of the writer, it did not matter how perfect the work was.\u00a0\u2018I will walk the money path with happiness\u2026!\u2019\u00a0She doesn\u2019t have to know the perfection of the work.Viola once again made eye contact with Hera, thinking so inwardly.\u2018Purse\u2026 My purse bag. I want you to soar.\u2019 With those thoughts, she did not take her eyes off Hera with a sense of anticipation.\u2018I wanted to make a good impression on Hera. It\u2019s not all about being strong. I like being strong, but that\u2019s not all.\u2019Everything in here is the same as in modern times.\u2018Money is better than being strong\u2026 Yes, it is.\u2019*** Visit website Zinnovel.com to read latest chapter ***Filled with determination, Viola declared to get closer to Hera no matter what it takes.

Although it had been only an hour or so, it felt like ten hours for her.\u2018It was so difficult. Ah, I\u2019m exhausted\u2026\u2019As soon as she came back to her room, she immediately threw herself onto the bed and laid back comfortably.Xenon, who followed her into the room, stood next to the bed.\u201cPrincess, you look tired.\u201d\u201cUgh. I am really tired.\u201dHe went closer to her and handed her a sweet juice.\u201cWould you like to drink this?\u201d He said, slowly lifting up the sprawling Viola on the bed as if she had melted to it.She had been noticing this for a while, but Xenon is surprisingly delicate. His hands are very soft and careful. Of course, he had a touch with an immense amount of care for Viola, and the way he speaks is kind as well.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Considering my condition, I only drank a weak poison.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s the way the duke is.Adding trace amounts of poison to all the foods. In order not to be poisoned, the body ingests acceptable levels of poison in advance. It was an act of increasing tolerance.\u201cHe must have put the exact measured amount of poison into consideration of my physical condition.\u201dColorless, odorless poison. It tasted just like orange juice.Oh, it\u2019s sweet.\u2018I really want to drink strawberry ade now.\u2019\u201cWhen I wake up, I want to drink strawberry ale.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have it ready.\u201d\u201cWith floating ice, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. I\u2019ll break the ice finely and raise it like a snowflake.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dViola thought it sounded a bit extra, but the thought of it was going to be delicious, anyway, so she didn\u2019t say anything else.Blink.\u00a0Her eyes are slowly shutting. It was no wonder because she had been pulling herself up since dawn. So, obviously, her seven-year-old body is unable to withstand the sleepiness and quickly became half asleep.Her consciousness is halfway gone, and Viola\u2019s mouth started to move against her will.\u201cI\u2019m sleepy\u2026\u201dZzzzz.At that, her body melted on the bed and fell asleep. Xenon gazed down at the bed, gazing at Viola\u2019s hair that was scattered randomly around her. A strand of her hair got in her mouth this time as well.\u201cHmm, hmm\u2026\u201dThe sleeping Viola chewed her hair like a cow.Seeing this, he carefully pulled out the hair from her mouth and asked softly, \u201cDo you mind if I apply the medicine?\u201dThough because she had fallen asleep, Viola couldn\u2019t answer.Xenon rolled up the blanket very gently until her shins and feet were visible. It was the part where poison is buried and burned.He put some ointment on it earlier. He thought it may take a few more times for it to fully recover.\u201cWell, excuse me, I\u2019ll take it since you allowed me.\u201d He said, falling down to his knees.Very slowly, he sat carefully so that she wouldn\u2019t wake up.Then, Xenon opened the lid of the ointment before applying it to the burned area with a delicate touch. He applied ointment several times at that position. When it dries, he applies it again. This process continued a couple more times.\u201cYou have to apply it more than once to avoid scarring.\u201dHe muttered and pulled his back up straight.Xenon knows.No matter how much Viola says it, no matter how talented a murderer is, it still hurts to get burned this much.Thinking back, he grinned as he glanced at the sleeping Viola.[ \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. I\u2019ll break the ice finely and raise it like a snowflake.\u201d ][ \u201cHmm.\u201d ]At that short moment, her expression became very bright. Her expression truly made him wonder, \u2018Is strawberry ale filled with ice that good?\u2019\u201cThat brightness\u2026 I don\u2019t hate it.\u201dIf possible, he wanted to see that brightness for a long time.\u201cOthers have never seen Princess Viola sleep like this before, have they?\u201dViola\u2019s appearance at the welcome dinner is far more fascinating than Xenon had imagined. She is more Verratoux than anyone else. Needless to say, even more than the pure-blooded Verratoux.\u2018That one who\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe that it was the same person who fell into the dreamland while chewing her hair like this. The gap between the conscious Viola and the unconscious Viola is as wide as the sky and the earth.Xenon grinned and continued to gaze at Viola\u2019s sleeping face.\u2018It\u2019s really strange\u2026\u2019Viola was a princess of Verratoux who could never be cute. However, strangely enough, her sleeping face is adorable.It\u2019s been about four hours.Opening her eyes slowly, the first thing she saw was Xenon\u2019s face.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI was just staying by your side.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe princess kept kicking the blanket.\u201dSo, Xenon had been staying with her for four hours, keeping her covered. He continued his words, \u201cBesides, you shouldn\u2019t have an upset stomach at times like this.\u201dTilting her head, she asked back.\u201cAt a time like this?\u201d\u201cYou had Potion Viola, remember, princess?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dTo be honest, he was just afraid because she drank the poison though Viola Verratoux shouldn\u2019t show weakness or something.\u201cYes.\u201dThat\u2019s right.There\u2019s nothing to worry about.But, it was then, Xenon suddenly smiled beautifully.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not sick, princess.\u201dThe tone was very sweet. Whatever the reason would be, for her, he seemed to be sincere in wishing that she doesn\u2019t get hurt.\u201cI\u2019m fine, so get out of here. Butler, get some rest, too.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAlthough he did answer yes, Xenon didn\u2019t really leave.\u201cBy the way, Princess. Do you mind if I am honest for a second?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dXenon smiled beautifully. He hesitated a little. At last, he spoke frankly, slightly scratching on his head.\u201cI was a little sad\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhen your leg was wounded.\u201d\u201cWhy would you be sad?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m weird, right?\u201dListening to his words, Viola was also confused.\u2018Why would he feel sad?\u2019Xenon is a unique character. He has no empathy for other people\u2019s pain or suffering at all, and so he doesn\u2019t know how it feels. In addition, he was also called a monster as a child.\u2019 However, right now, this emotionless character expressed sadness?Did he ever say he was sad before? She thought hard.\u2018No\u2026 There wasn\u2019t.\u2019No matter how many times Viola had thought about it, she was certain that Xenon himself wouldn\u2019t have been able to say something about \u2018emotions\u2019 so frankly, even before.\u201cUh, yeah\u2026 it\u2019s weird.\u201d\u201cI know. Why was I sad when your leg was injured?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dXenon is genuinely amazed.The thought was so bizarre that he felt amazed and smiled again.\u201cThis emotion\u2026 it\u2019s very strange. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve felt this emotion since I was born, and I don\u2019t want to feel this at all. I know what it\u2019s like to be sad, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been through it myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnyway, one thing is clear\u2026\u201dOne thing is certainly clear\u2026\u201cIt makes me sad when the princess gets hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201dViola, making a reasonable judgment as a true reader, felt confused. The reason why Xenon changed. The reason that he became aware of his feelings.In the end, she understood it.\u2018Probably because the character, Viola, has changed.\u2019So, it must have caused the character who was next to her, Xenon, to change as well. Now, Viola has become a more rational, more intelligent character. Therefore, Xenon, a character who constantly tests Viola, decided that it evolved accordingly.\u2018The way he shakes my reason, the way he tries to find a gap in me. It must have touched the emotional realm. He was constantly testing me in a slightly more evolved way\u2026\u2019All right.That\u2019s the kind of character he is!\u2018I think I know a little bit now. Phew, I\u2019d rather be clear and feel at ease understanding this now.\u2019Viola actually felt at ease.If a character like Xenon acts in a different direction from the original, her head might become complicated. Still, she felt comfortable knowing the reason for sure.\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to get hurt?\u201dAt that, she laughed ridiculously, \u201cI\u2019m a Verratoux.\u201dIt\u2019s impossible not to get hurt.No matter how low profile or how carefully she acts, it is inevitable to get hurt. It was already Viola\u2019s goal to survive and not to get hurt at all if possible.Understanding her words, he bowed his head.\u201cYou know too well, Princess Viola Verratoux.\u201d\u201cBut, why are we talking so much nonsense? What about getting hurt? What about getting sad? What do you think of me, Xenon?\u201dXenon spent a long time with his back bowed.Viola had no idea, but in fact, he is in a very confused state.He agonized. \u2018Can I really say this\u2026?\u2019After that ample pondering for a while, he eventually opened his mouth with much difficulty.\u201cYou are the princess of Verratoux that I serve\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I know it very well, so don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dXenon was a little heartbroken with what she said. It was more so because that statement was not wrong. Still, he just wished she wouldn\u2019t get hurt. He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d be sad.\u2018That must be my greed.\u2019He doesn\u2019t even understand why he is so greedy.\u201cCan\u2019t you give your butler a direct order?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want me to order you?\u201dAt that moment, the setting value of the character \u2018Xenon\u2019 set by the author had changed without the knowledge of either Viola or Xenon himself.\u201c\u2026An order to protect the princess.\u201dThe butler cannot protect a princess by his own will.To be fair, it\u2019s not that he can\u2019t protect her, but he really shouldn\u2019t. It was because Xenon is a butler, not an escort, after all.A princess under the protection of a butler cannot be called Verratoux.\u2018That\u2019s why I need her to order me\u2026\u2019An order to protect Viola. Being forced to abide by orders\u2026 Xenon thought that it would be fine that way.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, I wanted to protect you.\u201dViola squinted. \u2018Wow. It sounded so sincere.\u2019 If she hadn\u2019t dug into the original novel diligently, or if she hadn\u2019t known much about Xenon\u2019s character, Viola may have let it slide.\u201cLet\u2019s get our minds together.\u201dXenon only truly recognizes Viola only in the second half of the work.No matter how much she uses the information in the novel, she could not open all the doors to his heart all by herself, especially since she is only seven years old.\u2026And, she is swayed by those words of his.\u2018Protecting me\u2026 Is he trying to order me behind my back?\u2019Then, it may lead to him being deeply disappointed inside. Xenon will start to doubt her Verratoux\u2019s credibility again, which is seemingly unobtrusive.\u201cWhoa, I almost fell for it\u2026\u201dHis expression and tone looked so friendly and desperate.\u2018I almost fell for it.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not you who protect, but me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d\u201cThe Verratoux here is me, not you.\u201dA Verratoux is a protector.The Northern Forest, there is a shield that protects mankind from snowy areas.Xenon was silent for a moment, but then he answered.\u201c\u2026Thank you, princess.\u201d He said, pulling up his waist. His smiling face is filled with fondness for Viola.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that I\u2019m a butler at times like this.\u201d\u201cA shame?\u201d\u201cIf I were an outsider like Sir Hickson, would you have reached out to me for help?\u201d\u201cMaybe I would have.\u201dA day later, absurd news arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Played the Role of the Adopted Daughter Too WellChapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28Xenon delivered absurd news with a bright face.\u201cI resigned, princess.\u201dSaying so, he grinned.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be a butler anymore.\u201dFalling on one knee, in one hand, he was holding strawberry ade with ice. \u201cDo you mind if I become your good adult? I\u2019ll be an even better adult than Sir Hickson.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dViola\u2019s head got complicated. In the novel \u300c The Shadow of Verratoux \u300d Viola and Xenon are colleagues who work together until the second half of the story. So, why does he mean he would resign all of a sudden\u2026?Too much of a factor to change.\u2018What kind of resignation is this?\u2019Her head was still a bit complicated, but Viola still accepted the strawberry ade.And, another day passed.Consequently, Xenon\u2019s resignation was rejected.It was arranged by Butler Carlton.\u2018You didn\u2019t fulfil the seven-year mandatory period.\u2019\u2018If you still want to resign, follow the contract.\u2019\u2018The penalty is ten billion Dahlia.\u2019Viola, sitting on the chair, laughed in bewilderment.\u201810 billion Dahlia?\u2019Dahlia is similar to Korea\u2019s currency, Won. Therefore, ten billion Dahlias means that it is around ten billion won in Korean money.[ E/N: That\u2019s around 9 million USD. ]\u201cYou mean you signed such a ridiculous contract?\u201dIn the novel, the details of the contract were not clearly described. So, it was Viola\u2019s first time hearing this as well.As for the reason,\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t look over the details of termination because I never thought I would have to resign. The other conditions were very good.\u2019That was Xenon\u2019s answer\u2026Viola let out a sigh of relief.\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be this many variables.It\u2019s understandable that there will be twists in a novel, but there shouldn\u2019t be too many variables. If she does something wrong, her neck will be severed! This is a flying world.So, that means carefully, she has to slowly change everyone little by little.Xenon came into her room.Even today, he had brought strawberry ade in his hand.\u201cWell, that\u2019s too bad for you.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201dWhat a bummer!It is also mentioned directly in the novel. Only a few butlers are as good and capable as Xenon.\u2018This competent butler\u2026 there\u2019s no way he hasn\u2019t gone through the contract thoroughly.\u2019He must have known the terms of the contract. That\u2019s why he seemed to have taken a super strong initiative to resign. However, Butler Carlton wouldn\u2019t accept his resignation, and even if he does, Xenon wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay the penalty.That means, he tested me without being obvious, and it seemed like he was testing me cleverly like this.Truly, he\u2019s an outstanding character.She almost fell for him once again. \u2018Get your acts together.\u2019 Even if she gets bitten by Xenon, she can live as long as she gets her act together.\u2018Why is he so good at acting?\u2019And then,\u201cStrawberry ade is so amazing.\u201d She said, sucking the straw happily.\u2018Strawberry ade is incredibly delicious\u2026\u2019She has never had such a delicious strawberry ade on Earth in the 21st century. Furthermore, as her taste got younger, the strawberry ade that Xenon made was more impressive.Viola then said it with all her heart. \u201cYou cannot be freed from being a butler.\u201d\u201cI thought so.\u201d\u201cSo, stay by my side as a competent butler.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d He said, then took a notebook out of his arms. \u201cBut, there\u2019s something I need to report to you, Princess.\u201d\u201cReport?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dHesitantly, he scratched the back of his head. He wasn\u2019t sure how he would approach Viola with this information.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, tell me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the princess\u2019 dog\u2026\u201d\u201cTundra?\u201d\u201cYes. He was beaten to death every day, but he still could not kill his temper. There\u2019s also a rumor going around that he may die if this keeps up.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not going to die.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been observing discreetly, and he is really beaten to death several times now.\u201d Xenon seemed a little concerned as murder within the Winter Castle is strictly prohibited.Even if it\u2019sHickson, he will be beheaded if he kills inside the Winter Castle.\u201cNo, he won\u2019t die. He\u2019s just going to hit right before he would actually die.\u201dIt is the same in the novel. On the surface, it may seem as if he was being beaten, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Through that beating, Tundra will grow brilliantly.Knowing everything from the novel, Viola is relaxed.Xenon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cDo you have complete faith in Sir Hickson?\u201d\u201cTrust me, he\u2019s not gonna kill my dog. It\u2019s mine.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201dIt seemed to Xenon that Viola believed Hickson entirely. For a moment, Xenon was astonished. \u201cI think I\u2019ve developed feelings.\u201dAnd, the name of this emotion is\u2026\u2018Is it jealousy that I\u2019ve only heard before?\u2019 To be honest, he couldn\u2019t understand why she believed in only Hickson so much.A hero of the past, but hasn\u2019t he been like a scoundrel for three years?So, why does she trust only Hickson this much?\u2018Do I, to Sir Hickson, feel jealous\u2026?\u2019Still, Xenon tried to put on a nonchalant look. He suddenly remembered Viola\u2019s words.[ \u201cSo, you stay by my side as a butler.\u201d ]What Viola Verratoux wanted was Xenon, a competent butler. Then, he will be Xenon, the butler.Thinking so, he put his mind together.Viola Verratoux is a voracious Verratoux.He must become the Verratoux butler that she wanted. Jealousy is a feeling that he doesn\u2019t need at all as a butler. Xenon decided to cut out the feelings.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop by the training area, princess?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cTo see Sir Hickson. You\u2019d better see for yourself how he treats your dog, right?\u201dViola tilted her head.Why would she have to, anyway?It felt as though Xenon was messing around with something. For some reason, Viola felt like he didn\u2019t like Hickson.\u2018\u2026But, it must be just my feelings, right?\u2019Thinking back, he has been acting quite peculiar lately, but it\u2019s probably one of his tests.\u2018Yes, it must be so because Xenon is a character that has little to no emotion.\u2019Maybe it\u2019s just her feeling.Viola thought so.In the end, Viola agreed.To be fair, she is curious about how Tundra is training as well. She wondered how well he\u2019s growing up.\u2018I may be upset if I saw him in person.\u2019Tundra with Kang Han-Joon\u2019s face\u2026Saying that she\u2019s not scared would be a lie.It wasn\u2019t long before she arrived at the training area. Viola peered inside the area with an absurd look.\u2018Huh? Why\u2026?\u2019There, she saw Vixen and Tundra wielding their own weapons at each other, exuding brutality.\u201c\u2026Why is he here?\u201dGazing at them confusingly, she could feel the intense atmosphere. It was as if it was poking her skin like a sharp awl.\u2018Why is he covered in blood once again? What on earth is going on?\u2019Hickson, who is sitting on a bench on one side, came close and asked.\u201cHoo, you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cWhy, Why are they fighting?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a duel. Duel.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a duel?\u201d\u2018Do you have to be so reckless in life?\u2019Looking at the scene, it was more like they were trying to take each other\u2019s lives.\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a duel. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dHickson grinned and put his hand on his waist.\u201cLook, you\u2019ve lost weight, haven\u2019t you? Did you feel any better?\u201dEven though there is a fierce knife dance going on in front of them, Hickson seems to be in another world, chatting nonchalantly with her instead.\u2018It\u2019s really all right, right?\u2019At the very least, he is sober. So, Viola decided she could trust him in that predicament and answered his question.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but I went to the welcome dinner yesterday.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, my father was there.\u201dCompared to Duke Heron, most people in this world look like a squid. Though she is a bean curd myself, that fact is still true. Duke Heron\u2019s beauty has the ability to make people around him ugly, regardless of age or sex.\u201cCompared to my father, you are like an old squid.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard such novel poetry before, and it\u2019s surprisingly offensive. I don\u2019t like being perfectly understood.\u201dHe then frowned heavily. \u201cAlso\u2026\u201dHickson\u2019s eyebrows wriggled. He uttered out the part that was bothering him. \u201cDid you say \u2018my father\u2019?\u201d\u201cYes, Duke Heron Verratoux.\u201d\u201cSince when have you called him father? Are you that close to Heron now?\u201d\u201cIs he the type of person you can get along with?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s to be expected, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201dFrowning, Hickson asked again. \u201cYou\u2019re not close to him, are you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say if we\u2019re close or not.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. He\u2019s a tough guy. It\u2019s hard to get close to someone like him.\u201d Saying so, he had a look of satisfaction.\u201cBut, why are they fighting?\u201d\u201cI told you it\u2019s a duel, didn\u2019t I?\u201dViola turned towards Vixen and Tundra, who were in the middle of a battle. Seeing the scene, it is too intense to be considered as a duel at this point.While Vixen was holding a wooden dagger, a long wooden sword was in Tundra\u2019s hand.Let\u2019s just say, if those weapons weren\u2019t wood, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if one of them ended up dead by now.Regardless, Hickson had a funny look on his face. He lowered his voice and asked playfully.\u201cWho do you think will win if those two fight?\u201d\u201cPlease ask me the question straightaway.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWho would win if the two of them fought, or who would win in that situation?\u201dHickson\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u2018Look at this little girl!\u2019Although he already knew Viola is an extraordinary girl, he didn\u2019t expect her to point out critical points like this.For instance, in this very situation,1. There\u2019s an opening in the space.2. Viola is aware that the opponent is attacking Tundra skillfully.3. A situation in which a life-threatening wooden knife is being used to fight.And, most importantly\u20264. It hasn\u2019t been long since Tundra mastered swordsmanship.If things change, so will the results.Taking all these factors into mind, Han Arin recited what she read as a reader of the novel. \u201cVixen will win today.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Vixen is stronger.\u201dThe male lead, Tundra, is endowed with tremendous qualities and talent. He is a genius as in a novel. However, does that mean that Vixen falls far behind in talent than Tundra?In fact, that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201cVixen has been trained since birth. Besides, he\u2019s a pureblood Verratoux, so isn\u2019t it weird for him to lose?\u201d\u201cThen, why did you point out \u2018that\u2019s the situation\u2019?\u201dBefore she knew it, all the mischief was gone from Hickson\u2019s expression. His mood suddenly shifted, and he waited for Viola\u2019s answer.\u201cThat\u2019s because Vixen and Tundra\u2019s swordsmanship is different.\u201dHickson\u2019s heart began to pound rapidly.Recently, rumors are circulating in the duke\u2019s residence about the insight of the adopted youngest daughter. Rumor has it that she is the most insightful child compared to others in terms of abilities.*** Read lasted Chapter at website Zinnovel.com Only ***\u201cHow are they different?\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hickson just so happened to create a good opportunity, and she decided to make full use of it.\u201cVixen was trained as a secret killer. So, he doesn\u2019t fit in a battle in a place like this.\u201dVixen\u2019s trick is a covert surprise. In broad daylight of the \u2018let\u2019s fight each other!\u2019 situation, he learned the art of daggers that didn\u2019t fit the battle he\u2019s fighting with.\u201cOn the other hand, uncle\u2019s sword is a dominant sword. Now that Tundra has learned uncle\u2019s sword style, he\u2019ll have an advantage in this open battle.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d\u201cAs things stand, uncle seems to like Tundra?\u201d\u201cNevertheless, you still think that Vixen will win?\u201dViola nodded and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not up to Vixen in proficiency yet.\u201dNo matter how much of a genius Tundra is, in Viola\u2019s mind, the differences in their training period are too high. In the end, she concluded her thoughts.\u201cSo, if he doesn\u2019t make an obvious mistake, Vixen will win.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by an obvious mistake?\u201d\u201cSuddenly getting too excited to make a big move.\u201d\u201cLike being drunk?\u201dAt that, Hickson laughed loudly.\u201cIf he is caught off guard and shows a gap on purpose\u2026 There might be a case like that. Since Vixen is still young, and from his personality, he thinks this is a game. So, there\u2019s a chance for Tundra.\u201dHearing her words, he gazed at Viola for some time, bewildered.\u201cWhat? Is there something wrong with my face?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d He said, giggled softly before straightening himself.\u201cViola.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBe honest with me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cSeven.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not seven, are you? You look young, but you are actually not?\u201dA seven-year-old that is actually older?\u2018I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019To be fair, Viola is a little stingy, anyway. But it is true because she was a twenty-one-year-old inside, though she couldn\u2019t really advertise that.It was then,\u201cUwaah!\u201dA shout resounded.\u201cUwaah!\u201dTundra swung the wooden sword loudly.Whoosh!The sword tore through the air as Vixen laughed after lightly dodging Tundra\u2019s wooden sword. \u201cHehe. He\u2019s still clumsy!\u201dHis movement is too big. Even though Tundra is fast, it quickly consumes his physical strength. Realizing this fact, Vixen was smirking happily.\u2018I could see an opening.\u2019If he pokes it, it\u2019s over.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t poke him.\u201dFor Vixen, Tundra is an easy opponent. A novice with a lot of openings. Even Tundra knew that fact himself, and that made him furious.\u2018Damn it!\u2019His desire to win as a male lead was radiated. As he gets more excited, his body movements get bigger, and his body uses more strength. In the end, the more he swung, the more advantageous it was for Vixen.It was then, at the corner of his eyes, Tundra saw Viola and Hickson talking to each other.\u2018\u2026Master?\u2019\u2018Viola!\u2019Tundra and Vixen discovered Viola almost at the same time. And, they had different thoughts.\u201cI can\u2019t show her disappointment.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll show you how strong I am.\u201dRather, Tundra regained its reason. His head became cold, and he let go of some of his strength.\u2018I\u2019m not as good as him at this. That\u2019s why I have to aim for his gap.\u2019Now, it was Vixen who was off guard.\u2018There\u2019s only one chance. That little crack\u2026 that little crack\u2026\u2019That\u2019s where he\u2019s going to attack. Tundra realized that he\u2019d only get one shot. His reasoning subsided coldly. In contrast, now that Tundra is getting calm and collected, Vixen became a little excited.\u2018Because I\u2019m her older brother!\u2019Since he is older than her, Vixen wanted to show his strong side in front of Viola.\u2018Let\u2019s get it over in one go, then.\u2019In his mind, Tundra is just an underdog, and he could finish him at any time.Pride and carelessness.Mixed with the desire to look good to Viola, at that moment, his body is full of energy. Tundra bit his lip.\u2018He\u2019s coming.\u2019As Vixen\u2019s movement is bigger than before. He could see through his movements and the openings. Tundra took a left and narrowed the distance between themselves. And, at that moment, he seized the opportunity.The boy swung the wooden sword quickly.Snap!Something got caught in the wooden sword.\u201cStop.\u201dStepping in between Tundra and Vixen, Hickson grabbed Tundra\u2019s wooden sword with one hand and held Vixen\u2019s dagger with the other.\u201cIt\u2019s a draw.\u201dObviously, Vixen is unable to accept such a result. He yelled immediately, \u201cNo way!\u201dTundra then chimed in.\u201cWhat?! This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d\u201cI could have stabbed him in the heart!\u201d\u201cAnd, you\u2019d be decapitated instead. Did you forget? This is a longsword.\u201dIf it were a real sword match, Tundra would have been penetrated in the heart, while Vixen would have been decapitated.\u201cI knew that! I was going to avoid it!\u201d\u201cYes, of course, you knew,\u201d Hickson said, hitting Vixen, who was still yelling in the head.Bam!There was a sound.Even though Hickson thought that he was just hitting him lightly, the sound everyone heard sounded like a car accident.Vixen was upset.\u201cWhy are you hitting me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes were filled with life, angry.\u201cWhat?\u201dAgain, he hit Vixen on the head.Within the Verratoux Family, the only person who is able to hold the head of Verratoux Family pure blood is Hickson.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u201cAs much as you can.\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2019m seriously going to kill you.\u201dHickson scoffed loudly.\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be interesting?.\u201dLooking at the scene, Viola sighed unconsciously. That joke that came out, needless to say, was all true. Still, both were enjoying the situation, so she decided to step in.\u201cVixen.\u201d\u201cViola, it\u2019s not like I lost. Let me tell you what happened\u2026\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dViola then pulled a piece of paper out of her arms.\u201cHuh? A contract?\u201dPeering at it, he realized it was a contract to grant wishes, which he had signed with blood earlier on.\u201cNo matter how strong you are, you can\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s my wish.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAs Vixen glanced at the contract, his expression changed. However, his action still seemed unconvincing, so Viola opened her mouth again.\u201cAre you not going to follow through on the contract, brother?\u201d\u201cHa. I\u2019ll do it\u2026\u201dVixen couldn\u2019t hide his expression. Even if it seemed unfair, he couldn\u2019t help it.Vixen is a real do-it-it-all, and he\u2019s still young, so he\u2019ll go through stormy growth. Therefore, if he really happens to kill Tundra, a problem would arise. The male lead, who will be the centerpiece of this novel, will also disappear.\u2018I can\u2019t let him do that. The male lead needs to grow up great.\u2019So, she would ride the first princess line with the male character. That way, Viola will be able to stabilize this duke and transform this duchy full of life. She couldn\u2019t let this perfect plan be ruined.She said, \u201cKeep your words.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cSince you are my brother, you will do that, right?\u201d\u201cO-of course.\u201d\u201cThen, you\u2019ll keep your promise, right?\u201d\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201dAlthough it felt like he was being cheated, Vixen couldn\u2019t deny that Viola was not wrong.As an older brother, shouldn\u2019t he keep his promise? If he doesn\u2019t keep his promise that is on the contract, his prestige as a Verratoux won\u2019t stand.Meanwhile, Tundra bowed his head quietly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to show you my shameful face. I wanted to win\u2026\u201dHearing his words, Viola turned and stared at every inch of his face. There are some small scratches, but there was no major wound visible.\u201cNo, you did a good job. I\u2019m fine as long as you\u2019re not hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTundra bowed his head once again.\u2018Good job\u2026\u2019In fact, he is a little pleased with this remark.\u2018As long as you\u2019re not hurt.\u2019Those words were very pleasing. He doesn\u2019t know the reason. He doesn\u2019t know why it felt so good to hear that she doesn\u2019t want him hurt.\u2018\u2026I have to do well.\u2019With that in mind, he was determined to do better so that he will be able to defeat Vixen one day.Tundra saw a possibility today. Even though it may take some time, he wanted to be praised more, so he must be stronger than Vixen\u2026Tundra and Vixen\u2019s eyes met in the air.\u201cTo do that\u2026 I might have to kill you, Vixen.\u201dVixen also did not shy away from Tundra\u2019s eyes.He scoffed and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you. Mixed species.\u201dTo be honest, Vixen was angry seeing Viola praising her dog for doing well. He doesn\u2019t understand why, but he didn\u2019t like it.\u2018Why did she only praise the dog?\u2019He wants to get a compliment from her, too\u2026Frustrated, the thought kept on going. Viola didn\u2019t even ask him if he was hurt or not as well. He fought with a dagger as well!The sound of his heart resonated, but Vixen didn\u2019t hear it.\u2018It\u2019s annoying.\u2019He just thought he was annoyed at her for no reason.Tundra went closer to Viola.\u201cBy the way, Master\u2026\u201dHe knelt down on one knee. It looked like a young knight taking his oath as his eyes were filled with an unidentified, powerful longing.Tundra was like a dog who strongly craved snacks.A few days ago, Tundra witnessed a shocking scene.A big dog with gold fur.It was a scene in which a lady, who was presumed to be the owner, looked at the barking dog and grabbed the hem of her clothes. However, what\u2019s even more surprising is that the lady gazed at the dog as if it seems rather cute.The dog even licked the lady\u2019s face. It was a devastating scene for Tundra.\u2018I don\u2019t understand why\u2026\u2019Common sense had never made sense for him. Thus, Tundra secretly bought a book called\u00a0<b>\u300c Ultimate Guide for Dogs Language \u300d</b>\u00a0considered to be the exclusive possession of the ladies.And, the content is full of shocking information.\u2018Dogs beg the master to play\u2026?\u2019The scene of the dog biting and shaking her clothes was the scene of it begging the owner to play.\u2018\u2026Now, he\u2019s begging for a snack?\u2019It is also said that the behavior of the dog depends on its characteristics and education. Some dogs lie down and peep at their owners with adorable eyes, others bark at their owners for snacks, and the rest simply just lie down and protest.Sometimes they can be upset and happy, sometimes their emotions are unfiltered.Then, Tundra realized a new fact.\u2019This is what a dog is\u2026.!\u2019They are creatures that begged to play, protested, whined, wagged their tail, acted cute, annoyed to get snacks, and interacted emotionally with their owner.\u2018Ah. It\u2019s a lot more different than I thought\u2026\u2019That was when he got to know the new word.And from that day on, his dream is to become a pet dog.\u201cBy the way, Master\u2026\u201d He said, kneeling down on one knee.\u2018What is it?\u2019That desperateness is enough to make Viola sting. He had a serious look that almost looked like a reverence, and then he finally uttered something.\u201cI\u2019ll be a good dog\u2026\u201dHe put his head forward, leveling his knees down in a calm manner. It was as if he was saying, \u2018pat my head this instant.\u2019Seeing the scene, she was bewildered inside.\u2018\u2026Dog?\u2019For Viola, who lived in South Korea in the twenty-first century, the word \u2018dog\u2019 is very familiar. Still, she isn\u2019t used to that word being attached to humans.\u2018What the hell is he talking about now?\u2019It was as though he knew exactly what it meant when he said that he\u2019s going to be a good dog. The situation is just bizarre.\u201cSo, you\u2019re a dog\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, I said I\u2019d stay with you.\u201dThat was true. Still, what does it have to do with a dog?\u201cThe place next to you is called a pet\u2026\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Being the one next to her is to be a pet. And, he is a dog\u2026 So, that means his dream is to be a pet dog?\u201cBeing your pet dog is my dream.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut, you have not given me permission yet?\u201d\u201cSuddenly getting too excited to make a big move.\u201d\u201cLike being drunk?\u201dAt that, Hickson laughed loudly.\u201cIf he is caught off guard and shows a gap on purpose\u2026 There might be a case like that. Since Vixen is still young, and from his personality, he thinks this is a game. So, there\u2019s a chance for Tundra.\u201dHearing her words, he gazed at Viola for some time, bewildered.\u201cWhat? Is there something wrong with my face?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d He said, giggled softly before straightening himself.\u201cViola.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cBe honest with me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cSeven.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not seven, are you? You look young, but you are actually not?\u201dA seven-year-old that is actually older?\u2018I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019To be fair, Viola is a little stingy, anyway. But it is true because she was a twenty-one-year-old inside, though she couldn\u2019t really advertise that.It was then,\u201cUwaah!\u201dA shout resounded.\u201cUwaah!\u201dTundra swung the wooden sword loudly.Whoosh!The sword tore through the air as Vixen laughed after lightly dodging Tundra\u2019s wooden sword. \u201cHehe. He\u2019s still clumsy!\u201dHis movement is too big. Even though Tundra is fast, it quickly consumes his physical strength. Realizing this fact, Vixen was smirking happily.\u2018I could see an opening.\u2019If he pokes it, it\u2019s over.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t poke him.\u201dFor Vixen, Tundra is an easy opponent. A novice with a lot of openings. Even Tundra knew that fact himself, and that made him furious.\u2018Damn it!\u2019His desire to win as a male lead was radiated. As he gets more excited, his body movements get bigger, and his body uses more strength. In the end, the more he swung, the more advantageous it was for Vixen.It was then, at the corner of his eyes, Tundra saw Viola and Hickson talking to each other.\u2018\u2026Master?\u2019\u2018Viola!\u2019Tundra and Vixen discovered Viola almost at the same time. And, they had different thoughts.\u201cI can\u2019t show her disappointment.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll show you how strong I am.\u201dRather, Tundra regained its reason. His head became cold, and he let go of some of his strength.\u2018I\u2019m not as good as him at this. That\u2019s why I have to aim for his gap.\u2019Now, it was Vixen who was off guard.\u2018There\u2019s only one chance. That little crack\u2026 that little crack\u2026\u2019That\u2019s where he\u2019s going to attack. Tundra realized that he\u2019d only get one shot. His reasoning subsided coldly. In contrast, now that Tundra is getting calm and collected, Vixen became a little excited.\u2018Because I\u2019m her older brother!\u2019Since he is older than her, Vixen wanted to show his strong side in front of Viola.\u2018Let\u2019s get it over in one go, then.\u2019In his mind, Tundra is just an underdog, and he could finish him at any time.Pride and carelessness.Mixed with the desire to look good to Viola, at that moment, his body is full of energy.

Your secret.\u201dHickson said.\u201cMy secret?\u201dHearing his words, Han Arin felt cold sweats running through her back.\u2026A secret.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me he realized that I am a transmigrator?!\u2019\u201c\u2026You\u2019re born with mercenary skills.\u201dSaying so, he nodded to himself. Hickson concluded his words, \u201cWell, with that much insight, the art of you moving a person\u2019s mind is considerable.\u201dPerhaps that is a natural area. Isn\u2019t everyone born to be a little murderous?\u2018I don\u2019t think so\u2026\u2019In any way, Viola is an unusual kid.\u201cThat\u2019s why you approached me, hiding your true self. You pretended to be a young child looking for help.\u201d\u201cWhat do I really look like, then?\u201d\u201cThe image of the iron-blooded princess at the welcoming dinner?\u201d\u201c\u2026Iron-blooded princess?\u201dViola seemed to have heard that before. Rumor has it that the adopted princess has iron blood in her body. Rumor also has it that the adopted daughter, who is more Verratoux than anyone else, has been adopted in the family.\u201cI guess there are real rumors going around\u2026\u201dEven though Viola wanted to correct the misunderstanding, she couldn\u2019t. That fact that it wasn\u2019t a stigma, is falsified.\u201cYes, iron-blooded princess, a little one that is very ferocious.\u201dViola asked back brazenly.\u201cSo, you don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cNo, what? Who said I didn\u2019t like you? It\u2019s just\u2026 you are just too cute, way too cute.\u201dXenon flinched at the word.\u2018Lord Hickson\u2026 did he notice as well?\u2019It felt as if someone had revealed his secret that he only wanted to keep to himself, but he didn\u2019t express it.Meanwhile, Tundra peered up. He just wants her to look at him though she didn\u2019t even give him a glance. Right now, Viola had her own situation, but Tundra didn\u2019t know it.\u2018Please look at me.\u2019At that thought, he kept staring with eagerness. His master\u2019s eyes lit up.Viola also read Tundra\u2019s eyes.\u2018Stop staring at me!\u2019\u2018Please look at me. I beg you\u2026\u2019Tundra looked like a little puppy. Still, she couldn\u2019t stare at him because the real Viola might come out and take control of her body instead.Vixen, who had been silently observing the situation until now, read the strange aura. She wasn\u2019t making any eye contact with Tundra. Though he doesn\u2019t understand why, that makes him feel a little better.\u201cHehe.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t hide his feelings. Vixen smiled, scratching his cheek lightly.Then, Viola suddenly glanced at him and said, \u201cBrother, can I talk to you for a second?\u201d\u201c\u2026Me and you? The two of us?\u201dJust the two of us.Just us two.Us. two.Vixen\u2019s eyes shine excitedly at the thought.\u201cUh, yeah, two of us\u2026?\u201d\u201cWithout him, too?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBy now, Vixen\u2019s mouth was caught pulled up to his ear. Tundra\u2019s gaze became more severe as she was very conscious about it.\u201cLet\u2019s go! And talk! Just the two of us!\u201dViola, who was already leading the way, did not see Vixen\u2019s big smile.Viola\u2019s room.Vixen sat on the chair. He put his arms between his thighs and pulled his body forward. It seems that he is looking forward to hearing her words.\u201cWhat are we going to talk about?\u201d\u201cI saw your eyes fixated on my dog earlier.\u201dIn the novel, it was also mentioned.[ \u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d ][ \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, too\u201d ]She had already read that these kinds of hot-blooded eye contacts were exchanged. On Viola\u2019s side, it is complicated. Fortunately, she had learned how to handle Vixen with her tactics.\u201cI know why you lost in the duel earlier.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lose, it\u2019s a draw!\u201d\u201cYou lost.\u201dIf there are no unusual variables, Vixen should have won.But, it was a draw\u2026That meant that he was defeated. He had a draw for his superior performance.\u201cNo! It is definitely a draw!\u201dListening to his protests, Viola sighed.\u2018Obviously, a child is a child. I\u2019m going to solve it and explain it.\u2019\u201cBrother is a lot better. Right?\u201d\u201cYes, of course! It\u2019s me, after all.\u201dVixen is as condescending as he could be. The boy straightened his shoulders and raised his nose.\u2018No, it\u2019s not\u2026 This is not a compliment!\u2019\u201cEven though if it\u2019s a draw, it means you lose. The stronger person got into a tie with the weaker person.\u201dNot losing, he still denied vigorously.\u201cStill, the result is a tie.\u201dShe eventually frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s not cool.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dVixen\u2019s body flinched.The killer was so surprised at her words that he almost lost a sense of balance and almost rolled off the chair. Seeing his reaction, Viola thought it might be a big mental shock.After a long moment of silence, Vixen made his own reasonable reasoning.\u201cIs it because I lost?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIn fact, Viola didn\u2019t care who won.That fact didn\u2019t matter to him in the slightest. For her, just winning doesn\u2019t make it cooler. She prefers characters who don\u2019t win and don\u2019t take risks.She opened her mouth again.\u201cIf you\u2019re Verratoux, shouldn\u2019t you be making a point about what happened to you but rather think about further development based on the results? That\u2019s being reasonable.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2026that\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u2014\u201d\u201cBrother lost your composure at the moment, and your movements got too big. That\u2019s why you have allowed the much weaker Tundra to attack you. Weak Tundra realized his only weakness and found an opportunity. He did well.\u201dHan Arin, the true reader, had a quick insight into Vixen\u2019s psychology. As the older brother, he thought that he should be strong!\u2018I\u2019m strong!\u2019It seemed like he wanted to strongly insist on this.\u201cAnd when the fight was over, brother kept glaring at Tundra.\u201d\u201cYes, I mean, it was a draw. But, you\u2019re only at Tundra\u2026.\u201d\u201cOnly at him?\u201d\u201cNever mind. I won\u2019t tell you.\u201dIt was a draw, but she only complimented the dog, and she didn\u2019t give much attention to him. And, she only cared about him.The eight-year-old Vixen is grumpy for nothing.\u201cThat\u2019s not cool.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a Verratoux.\u201dBy now, Viola has learned a lot about how to handle Vixen.\u201cBesides, Tundra is just my dog, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cVerratoux must always be strong. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cYou are not wrong.\u201d\u201cI felt it when I saw father at the welcome dinner. Father is relaxed. When I looked at father, I realized that it is the relaxation of the strong.\u201dWith everything she said, Vixen is at a loss for words.Everything Viola said is correct.\u201cIf you\u2019re a strong man, you should be able to relax and be calm. That\u2019s proof that you\u2019re not yet a strong man.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI want my brother to be strong.\u201dVixen gulped his saliva.Somehow, he couldn\u2019t deny anything she had said.\u201cSo, don\u2019t expose yourself to my dog like that.\u201dTundra needs to grow safely and well. That means in the meantime, until then, Vixen should not seriously injure or kill him.\u2018So, please! Help the male lead grow up well!\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s how Verratoux is. Be a strong brother.\u201dVixen shook his head with a throb, but in reality, he felt good. Couldn\u2019t hide his feelings anymore, he gazed at Viola again.\u201cHe\u2019s just a dog, and I\u2019m an older brother, right?\u201dIt feels like the focus is a little bit off.It isn\u2019t wrong, so she agreed to it.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of weird for me to really deal with a guy who acts like a dog, right? I\u2019m a hell of a Verratoux after all.\u201dViola nodded to his words.\u201cThen, will you not keep your dignity and spare the weak?\u201d\u201cWould that be cool?\u201d Vixen\u2019s eyes contained strange expectations once again.There was no such content in the original novel.There, Vixen and Viola grew into rivals as they showed equal growth speed at the beginning of the book. However, now, she could feel it herself. Strangely, it doesn\u2019t feel like they are rivals at all.It is a strange feeling.For some reason, Vixen keeps on obsessing over \u2018coolness.\u2019 So, even though it wasn\u2019t in the original, it is still good for her anyway. Talking about that, now that she\u2019s swung a lot of sticks, it\u2019s time to give him a carrot.\u201cIt\u2019ll be cool..\u201d\u201cHehe. Does Viola want Vixen to be cool?\u201d\u2018All I want is just to sleep well and don\u2019t follow me with a knife.\u2019Well, she couldn\u2019t say that, though.Thinking so, she just nodded her head helplessly. Then, Vixen smiled more brightly.\u201cYou need to be cool. To do so, I felt I had to find some ways to relax.\u201dThere was nothing wrong with Viola\u2019s words.\u201cAs expected, I don\u2019t want to kill the dog.\u201dHe thought he\u2019d let the dog off the hook even if it came at him hard. Hence, he decided not to kill the dog.After a while, eventually, Vixen returned to his room on his own.Lulu~\u00a0As he was leaving, his humming was heard over the door to Viola\u2019s room. She tilted her head and leaned at the chair exhaustedly.\u2018Is this going to be okay?\u2019Overall, she was quite certain it would be going well. Most of it seems to be going well as intended, but she could feel something strangely out of place.\u2018It\u2019s just my feeling, isn\u2019t it?\u2019It\u2019s been a few days since that day.Viola had been waiting for one person every day. In the novel, the exact date is not mentioned, but it should only be a few days later\u2026\u201cSoon\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s time for Hera to come, and it\u2019s time for the next chapter of \u2018Meeting Hera\u2019 to start.Just as she buttoned up properly on her first encounter with Duke Heron, Viola has to fasten the buttons properly, even at the first meeting with Hera as well. It was because she wanted to live a different life from the original Viola.\u2018It\u2019s going to be a really important meeting.\u2019Few days passed once again.\u2018What is it?\u2019It\u2019s been two weeks later, but Hera has yet to show up.\u2018Why isn\u2019t she showing up? Something seemed to have changed\u2026?\u2019 As time was ticking away, Viola felt nervous for no reason.\u201cDon\u2019t let too much time pass\u2026\u201dThe original content should not be changed too much. Because knowledge is power, she can change things only if she knows.And so, she decided.\u201cXenon, send this note to Sister Hera.\u201dIt said, just like a thirsty man digs a well. If Hera doesn\u2019t come first, then she would just throw the hook first instead. This matter is too significant to turn a blind eye to.\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just trying to be friendly.\u201dHearing so, he took the note and asked, \u201cShall I deliver it now?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe next day.Knock, knock.Finally, she could hear a knock from outside the door.\u201cHere she comes!\u201dViola had a hunch it was Hera. A faint sound of a man could be heard, presumably Hera\u2019s butler.\u201cPrincess Hera is waiting. Do you mind if we come in?\u201dXenon asked. \u201cDo you want me to open it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe door slowly opened, and Viola greeted the guest.\u201cCome on in, sister.\u201dViola felt like hearing voices in her ears.Kaching!\u00a0She\u2019s a rich kid.Viola smiled brightly. It was the brightest since she possessed here.And so, the butler pushed Hera\u2019s wheelchair.Entering the room, she could see Hera, who was wearing a modest blue dress. Her silver hair was so shiny, and it matched well with her pale skin. Sitting in a wheelchair, she arrived right in front of Viola.\u201cButler, please go outside.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dViola, knowing what she meant, said quickly, too. She was more tactful than ever.\u201cXenon, go out, too. I want to talk to my sister alone.\u201d\u201cOkay, shall we prepare some refreshments?\u201d\u2018I want strawberry ade!\u2019Although that was what she wanted to say, Viola held the thought in.\u201cDo you want some refreshments, sister?\u201d\u201cThis is all right for me.\u201dAfter Hera\u2019s words, she replied back to Xenon quickly as well.\u201cI\u2019m good, too.\u201dAnd so, both butlers left the room.She decided not to go against the murderer brother\u2019s plan, but she also decided to not go against the rich older sister\u2019s plan.Hera and Viola.*** Read lasted Chapter at website Zinnovel.com Only ***Only the two of them remained here. There is a strange silence between the two, and the first person to open their mouth is Hera.\u201cFor what reason did you insult me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt a little different from Vixen\u2014if he had the murderous look of an untamed cat or leopard, then Hera seemed to have the murderous look of a serpent hiding poison in her molars.\u201cYou must have received my letter, sister.\u201dThe content of the note itself is not much.[ I want to be close to you, sister. ]In a way, to say \u2018want to be close\u2019 was close to an insult, because Hera couldn\u2019t walk. Besides, if a Verratoux said wanted to be friendly, it also meant that you\u2019re not my match.Viola turned away before smiling brightly.\u201cI didn\u2019t insult sister.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that this note wasn\u2019t meant to be an insult?\u201d\u201cIf you had thought so, I don\u2019t think you would have come to see me, sister.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t be here if she thought it was a real insult as she had potentially defined it. However, it is a relief. Whatever the reason was, Hera came to see her.Han Arin, who is a reader, knows that very well.\u2018You have a thing for me.\u2019She knows everything from the novel, from the very first part of the novel.Immediately after the welcoming dinner, Hera has a big crush on Viola. So, she reaches out her hand to be an ally, but is kicked out by Viola.\u2018I\u2019m sure you still have a big crush on me\u2026\u2019So, sister please say \u2018I\u2019ll invest in you\u2019. Please hit the ceiling![\u00a0<b>T/N:</b>\u00a0\u2018Please hit the ceiling\u2019 means hit highest part of all. ]\u2018I love you, my stock.\u2019Meeting Hera. This part is also a part that Han Arin personally regretted. Suddenly, she remembered the regrets of being a reader.Viola recalled the original story.\u300c Hera gave up being the family head. Instead, Hera decided to help the family head. \u300dBecause she had physical limitations, she didn\u2019t want to be the Duke herself.Hera came into contact with her brothers, while hiding her sharp claws, judged and made her decision. Who will she raise to be her successor\u2014who will she hold hands with. Constantly testing and supporting her siblings.So, in a sense, she is also the most demanding sibling.In the novel, the Duke once mentioned this,\u300c \u201cThe child chosen by Hera will be the heir, Madam.\u201d\u201cShe cannot be the king herself, but she is a child who can raise the King.\u201d \u300dBut, Viola hated such a Hera, and that\u2026 was Viola\u2019s mistake in the beginning.Han Arin made a resolution again.\u2018I will never do that. As soon as I become an enemy with Hera, my whole life will crumble and be ruined.\u2019Every moment she would have to worry about the back of her head, and each and every life will become a series of crises. Even though Viola is a lunatic who enjoyed those situations, it wasn\u2019t the same for Han Arin.\u201cI mean it, but I apologize if you felt insulted. I don\u2019t know much about the Verratoux Family yet.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201dHera smiled once as if it was absurd.\u2018A kid who doesn\u2019t know Verratoux did that at the welcome dinner?\u2019Viola smiled lightly and asked back, \u201cWhy is sister here?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a sister\u2019s duty to check our youngest\u2019s face?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dShe walked without hesitation toward Hera, then made eye contact with the girl in a wheelchair. Viola, who is very short, could make eye contact with Hera without bending her waist.\u201cThen, check it out, my face. \u201cShe brought her face closer to you\u2014to the point where their noses are almost touching.\u201cYou can check it as much as you want.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHera is a little taken aback.Viola\u2019s face is just too close. She could feel her breath.\u300c At the welcome dinner, Hera had a strange feeling. It was a likability that originated out of longing. \u300dWould she have done that if she were in that position? A feeble yearning that started from that point.\u2018\u2026I wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u2019What Hera didn\u2019t have, Viola had. She had vast confidence that is not daunted by anyone and arrogant eyes as if she was born with a predator\u2019s fate.Hera felt those things at the welcome dinner.It is the same as now.She felt a strange ease with Viola. Even though the girl in front of her is definitely her younger sister, it felt as though Viola was the older sister instead.\u2018You act like that if it is just imitation or simple acting.\u2019It must have been a kind of talent she had innately. Hera was so misunderstood, Viola continued the eye contact.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about Verratoux yet.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say it is.\u201d\u201cBut, I know one thing. The law of the jungle. If you don\u2019t prove your qualifications, you\u2019ll be culled.\u201d\u201cWell understood.\u201dViola put her hands on Hera\u2019s shoulder, twirling slowly around her. Playing as Verratoux now has become natural.\u201cWhen I first saw the family chart, I was curious. How can a lame princess survive here?\u201dHera is twelve years old. Children over the age of ten also deviate from the law of protection. At that point, Verratoux\u2019s clans choose their career paths at the age of ten and begin to grow as candidates for succession.And then, it would be the time to play their part when they reach twelve.\u201cI don\u2019t have any official records of your duties. How did sister grow up to be Verratoux in two years? I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201dViola grinned.\u2018You like smart people, right? I\u2019m smart, too!\u2019\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, would you listen to me, sister?\u201dThere is a reason why Hera, a princess whose legs were broken, survived here. Han Arin is well aware of that reason.It was because Hera is not a character who uses her body, instead, she uses her brain. She is a character who grows up by choosing a career path as \u2018White Verratoux\u2019 at the age of ten.\u201cI heard you often stop by father\u2019s study even though you don\u2019t have a mission.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done a pretty detailed investigation.\u201d\u201cYes, the butler is competent.\u201dNot really\u2026 Well, she saw it all in the book\u2026\u201cSo, what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cThe fact that you can survive here with this kind of body. I think that would mean that you have some special ability that I don\u2019t know about?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThis was the customized approach Viola had chosen.Hera gazed at Viola, who happened to be passing in front of her. She looked at Viola\u2019s profile. Her purple hair was dancing.\u201cRight above me, there\u2019s a crazy brother.\u201d\u201cVixen?\u201d\u201cYes, I thought about why older brother wouldn\u2019t come at you, sister.\u201dThis is because Duke Heron gave the order himself.[ Don\u2019t touch Hera. ]\u201cNo matter how hard I think about it, I can only interpret that father gave the order himself. I think father ordered not to touch you, sister.\u201dThat fact was certain.Since she has read it all in the novel.\u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s what father ordered.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that is the case for all the siblings, right?\u201dHera did not deny it.It was all correct.\u201cFather is a reasonable man. He couldn\u2019t have done that for no reason.\u201d\u201cSo, that\u2019s why I was sure you have a special ability. Since they won\u2019t be able to get close to you, they wouldn\u2019t even know what it is, isn\u2019t that right?\u201dViola paused. And, like a villain in a novel, she whispered in Hera\u2019s ear.\u201cHmm. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dHera\u2019s body flinched.She could feel a ghostly energy in her voice.It was actually her innate ability, after all. Though it feels like a whisper from an evil spirit\u2026Viola intended to act beautiful, but in reality, she became a ghost. Of course, Viola didn\u2019t expect to be recognized that much. She just did her best to do what she had to do. The important thing right now is to get Hera on her side.She then pointed out the fact she saw in the novel.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the Duke.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe thing you wanted to be is the King Maker, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHera squinted her eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve never revealed that in front of my siblings\u2026\u201dEven though it was certain that Hera was thinking about that, she never showed it on the surface. Her other siblings might now, but not the seven-year-old girl. So, it wasn\u2019t something that a child who had only been in the house for about ten days would know.\u2018This is fun.\u2019The new sister.And so, Hera decided to have a conversation with Viola. She wondered if it would be okay for her to choose? How accurate were her father\u2019s eyes? Is this yearning she holds justified?Maybe it\u2019s like a fantasy for this kid.Hera shrugged and made eye contact with Viola. It was so sudden that she almost flinched at that moment.\u2018Her eyes are alive now.\u2019It became bright.Somehow, Hera had the kind of look that was similar to Vixen\u2019s lively appearance when saying, \u2018Let\u2019s have a slaughter race!\u2019Han Arin knew why Hera\u2019s eyes were alive.\u2018She wants to test me seriously.\u2019It meant that she had to pass the test as well. Moments later, Hera opened her mouth again. \u201cI\u2019ve never said that before, not even once, from my own mouth.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cBut, you\u2019re definitely thinking that is the case, right?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m certain.\u201d\u201cWhy so?\u201d\u2018I saw it in the novel.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re smart, sister.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s just say so.\u201d\u201cI also know that a person who is directly protected by father will never be the head of the family. That is something as expected.\u201d\u201c\u2026I suppose so.\u201d\u201cThen, why would a smart person like you take father\u2019s protection?\u201d\u201cDid I claim to be? Can he take responsibility for my life?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve met father twice.\u201dShe pointed out one fact.\u201cHe\u2019s not that delicate.\u201dThat\u2019s the charm about her favorite character, Duke Heron, but Viola swallowed her words.\u201cIs there someone who isn\u2019t so delicate, would come forward and tell everyone not to touch our smart Fourth princess?\u201dAt that, Viola continued to recite the words in the novel as though she had deduced and inferred them.\u201cFather is not delicate, but he is reasonable.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to imply?\u201d\u201cMy smart sister asked him for protection, and the reasonable father accepted it.\u201dHera\u2019s eyes began to shine more.\u201cKeep talking.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the family head, but you would have played a role in supporting them.\u201dViola in the original ignores Hera because of that.\u201cFather and sister must have made a deal. Sister gave up her position as the family head, and in exchange, gained protection. At the same time, it must have been a deal that you definitely support the people who would become the owner and strive for the prosperity of Verratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn Verratoux, the people who play this role are called \u2018White Verratoux\u2019.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s called the White Verratoux.\u201d\u201cYes. Growing up as a White Verratoux would have been the best choice for my unwell sister. That is the smartest and most reasonable decision.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dViola is sincere. She certainly admired her as a reader.The deal takes place at the age of ten for Hera. Duke Heron liked Hera, the Fourth Princess who had offered him such a deal at the age of ten, and accepted her offer.She then shrugged.\u201cI mean it. I think you are very Verratoux, sister.\u201dShe can\u2019t be a murderer machine like Vixen. Instead, she did the best she could within her ability. Han Arin, who is a reader, is very aware of that fact.\u201cVery Verratoux-like, you say?\u201d\u201cBecause you did the best you could. I admire that point of view of yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI mean it.\u201dListening to Viola\u2019s words, Hera had a strange feeling. To be honest, this was the first time she\u2019s heard of that.\u2018\u2026Admire.\u2019A word unexpected came from Viola.Hera considers herself a coward to receive protection from her father. She is incompetent, in a way, so she can\u2019t even compete.A half-fledged Verratoux that does not become a Black Verratoux symbolizing a real Veratoux but chooses the White Verratoux that hides its head or uses it.That is the current status of Princess Hera.The one who said that she was a Verratoux is herself. Furthermore, Viola is the first of the siblings to say that she admired her.Eventually, Hera smirked.She looked at Viola with strange eyes and said, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dViola felt tingling inside. Her eyes looked sharp. She then uttered meaningful words.\u201cActing with a mask that doesn\u2019t look good on you. Aren\u2019t you frustrated?\u201dBoom!Viola felt like her heart was sinking.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

DO NOT STEAL MY TRANSLATION!It felt as if Hera was seeing through Han Arin, her true self, as who she really is. The fierce eyes that are like a menacing snake seemed to be sweeping through her body.\u201cIt must be hard to hide the madness that\u2019s about to explode.\u201d\u2026Huh?\u201cThe truth is you want to go even more wild?\u201d\u2018\u2026Me?\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t you want to do the sword dance more ferociously and sing a song of poison?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dOh, wait.\u2018Me?\u2019At Viola\u2019s silence, Hera thought otherwise\u2014she thought they had an implicit agreement.\u201cYou\u2019re holding it in well.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, people who just crave blood are not Verratoux\u2026 They\u2019re just killing machines.\u201dVerratoux and a killing machine are different.The killing machine is just regarded as a criminal, while Verratoux is a ruler.Viola passed in acting as a ruler. Because she acts like a ruler, she knew how to control her madness. Uncontrolled madness leads to destruction, while controllable madness is an essential virtue of a true Verratoux.\u201cDidn\u2019t Xenon report it like that? You also have the rationality to control your madness.\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cIt was shared between the butlers.\u201dSaying so, Hera nodded. \u201cIn fact, I think Xenon gave too much generosity in giving the score. I was really curious.\u201d\u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen me in person, what do you think, sister?\u201d\u201cThat was an accurate score after all.\u201dHera\u2019s facial expression relaxed.\u201cI like you, too, Viola.\u201dHearing that, Viola was a bit taken aback. It felt like the development was more rapid than she thought. Hera then suddenly reached out and caressed her cheek.\u201cYour face is really my taste.\u201dAt this point, it was Viola who thought the situation was rather absurd.\u2018No, this isn\u2019t it.\u2019She had to come to her senses. I feel like the initiative has now been handed over to Hera.Hera is smart. She must have been testing her while pretending to admit her thoughts completely.\u2018Hera wants to be the absolute.\u2019She wanted a strong absolute who could protect her perfectly. Her first and second siblings will take care of the \u2018real absolute,\u2019 anyway.So, it\u2019s up to them.Now, all she had to do was show the \u2018carbon copy\u2019 absolute.She snapped Hera\u2019s hand in a flash\u2014snap!\u00a0Then, Viola swept her hair down.\u201cMy pretty sister.\u201dViola\u2019s fierce eyes turned to Hera\u2019s.Because of that, Hera swallowed dry saliva without realizing it. That hand sweeping down her hair made her feel a strange fear as if it would dig into her neck any time soon.Of course, Viola didn\u2019t mean to go that far.She thought the original Viola would have acted like this, so she just imitated it. She then said, \u201cDon\u2019t cross the line.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was me who chose you, sister.\u201dHer tone is full of murderous energy. It was the original murderous energy from Viola\u2019s body.Hera flinched. She is very ill, but she could sense a natural feeling of murderous energy. \u201cWhat is this incredible murderous energy?\u201dShe muttered quietly as the thought that Viola could kill people only by her murderous energy.\u2018I can feel the tremendous amount of magic.\u2019She felt a huge wave of magic.However, Viola, who exudes her murderous energy, is not aware of her own murderous energy at all. Her words kept flowing.\u201cIt\u2019s not sister who chose me.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dAs Hera was still silent, Viola opened her mouth again.\u201cNod if you understand, sister.\u201dHera nodded slightly immediately while glancing up at Viola.Viola\u2019s appearance is what she usually admires.Her power and resourcefulness at the same time, and not intimidated by anyone. Along with her attitude that it is appropriate to be \u2018the absolute.\u2019 Viola possessed the gift to support such attitudes and personalities.\u2018Yet the insidiousness and scheming that can conceal itself.\u2019\u2026She could feel it all from Viola.Hera felt suffocated. It was difficult for her to breathe.This is the presence of the character \u2018Viola.\u2019Viola, who is actually the subject of Hera\u2019s thought, doesn\u2019t even realize that fact. Meanwhile, Viola watched silently.\u2018Is that enough?\u2019It is not easy to imitate Viola in the original story, so she felt as though she was wearing clothes that didn\u2019t suit her.\u2018Today\u2026 Isn\u2019t it a little awkward?\u2019She thought her acting today was rather awkward, so she decided to put her worry behind her and smiled.\u201cWe could be good sisters.\u201d\u201cI think so, too.\u201dHera\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.\u2018She\u2019s definitely not as good as our first or second siblings. Not yet.\u2019Viola\u2019s still too young. She didn\u2019t have a location base yet. So, Hera can\u2019t even get help from her mother\u2019s family as the gap between the first and second has already widened too much.But, one thing is different.She\u2019s only seven years old.The first and second are not as good as her when they were seven years old. That means that VIola\u2019s growth potential is extremely high\u2014her potential is so enormous.\u2018It\u2019s enough to make it hard to breathe just by the murderous energy.\u2019If she grows up properly, how strong will she be\u2026?Cutting the silence, Viola added one more thing.\u201cI want us to be a good family for each other.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHera was speechless for a moment.That phrase\u2026 That phrase is so warm. It is showing warmth but not servile enough. Hera didn\u2019t consider herself thirsty for affection, nor did she feel lonely, though the word touched the part of her that she never knew.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI want to be a good family member.\u201d\u2018Rich sister. I\u2019ll be nice to you!\u2019Let\u2019s get along!!\u201cYou are so warm, Viola.\u201dHera is as vigilant as Viola is. Hence, the clever Hera interpreted Viola\u2019s warmth in her own way.\u2018There must be a sharp thorn hidden in her warm tone.\u2019What is a good \u2018family\u2019 for Verratoux?It is quite a different concept from what is commonly referred to as \u2018family.\u2019 Verratoux\u2019s \u201cgood family\u201d should be able to benefit each other\u2014A good family is someone who can maximize profits by taking advantage of each other.Viola\u2019s words were alluding to that route.Still, she liked the warmth of her phrase. Hera grinned unconsciously.Viola felt a little ominous about that look.The next day, Hera came back.\u201cI have a place to go for a while, would you mind?\u201d\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201dHera lowered her voice and continued.\u201cOh, I want us to have a secret between us.\u201dThis phrase appears in the novel.\u300c The clever rabbit digs three burrows. \u300d*[ T/N: An idiom meaning: a smart person always keeps a few options open for himself in the face of uncertainties. ]Clever rabbit is the phrase for Hera.Realizing her physical limitations early on, and accordingly, she prepared various countermeasures in advance.\u300c The \u2018Tera Business,\u2019 located at the intersection of seasons, is one of them. \u300dHera, the Fourth Princess, had long realized that ice, which is common in Winter Solstice Castle, is considered precious in the southern part of the country.\u300c In order to transport ice without melting, magical power was essential. Hera, the fourth Princess, mobilized the wizard to make the Tera Business. That happened when she was nine years old. \u300dViola was lost in deep thought as she recalled the original story. The place where Hera asked her to go together was the Tera Business. It is all right there, though there is a slight problem.[ \u201cYou and me. I want to have a secret between us.\u201d ][ \u201cSecret?\u201d ][ \u201cIt\u2019s a secret from the butlers, too. I want to go there alone with you. I\u2019ll show you my power, but you need to keep it a secret.\u201d ][ \u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell your butler?\u201d ][ \u201cYes, it\u2019s a secret. It\u2019s the top-secret that I kept.\u201d ][ \u201cWhat about our father?\u201d ][ \u201cFather doesn\u2019t even know it.\u201d ][ \u201cThen, why did you keep it a secret?\u201d ][ \u201cBecause\u2026 invisible knives are scarier than the visible one.\u201d ]Originally, Viola and Hera don\u2019t get along.So, there was no such event in the original book.Han Arin thought that without the help of the original work, she had to solve the situation on her own. However, that was the problem.\u2018It can\u2019t be a secret to the butler.\u2019The butler can\u2019t be unaware.And whatever happens in the winter castle, their father shouldn\u2019t be oblivious to it. But, Hera clearly said that he doesn\u2019t even know what fact as well.\u2018Our father doesn\u2019t know? What\u2019s going on in the Winter Castle?\u2019This should be a lie.If it isn\u2019t, then the answer would be\u2026\u2018She\u2019s lying to me.\u2019In a way, it could be a test for Viola herself, but what kind of test is it\u2026?Is it a ruse?The idea of an insidious ruse should not be ruled out since this is a world where the back of her head is regarded as a routine, anyway.Viola decided to prepare in her own way.She observed the note that Hera left earlier.[ At 3:18 PM, I\u2019m going out the west door.Viola, you should come out the south door in forty minutes. Let\u2019s meet at the intersection of seasons. You have to come alone. ]And so, Viola left the duke\u2019s residence alone.No one stopped the seven-year-old from moving alone.\u2018They\u2019re letting me out alone?\u2019We don\u2019t even have a butler.\u2018Hera must have used her hand in advance\u2026\u2019Maybe the gatekeepers are accustomed to the fact as Hera is fully capable of doing so.\u2018Shall we go?\u2019Thinking so, she moved her feet.It is the third-largest intersection in Winter Castle, the Season Intersection.It was a busy street with people and supplies, and numerous buildings rising along the boulevard. However, behind this busy street, there are complicated alleys like spider webs. The streets are splendid, but the road is underdeveloped right next door.The reason why it was called \u2018Season Intersection\u2019 was because it is where one can definitely feel the gap between rich and poor in Winter Castle.\u2018If you look at the map\u2026\u2019Perhaps it\u2019s this way, she walked along as the map showed.And, left turn\u2014Far ahead, there was one shabby bar.[ Moonlit Night ]Since it was still daytime, they didn\u2019t seem to be open yet.\u2018Walk with your back to the moonlit night, and then on the second alley to the right\u2026\u2019Thankfully, the instruction was explained here thoroughly that she would find a small two-story building.\u2026Although the said building was not visible.\u2018There\u2019s no building.\u2019It is a blocked place.At the building that is supposed to be situated, there was a wall instead of a building. It was a dead-end.Creak.Suddenly, the door of the moonlit night opened, and four masked people walked out of there. They had a deadly weapon in each of their hands.One of the masked men opened his mouth first, \u201cWhat brings you to this narrow, shabby alley, little girl?\u201d\u201cYou must have been lost when you came here alone.\u201dOne man was holding a big hatchet.\u201cCharles is right, isn\u2019t he? If we wait here, we\u2019ll get a couple of stupid young girls.\u201d\u201cI know, it\u2019s been a couple of days.\u201dTalking among themselves, the four men walked towards her slowly. They are emitting some kind of vicious force\u2014it is as if meeting the enemies of one\u2019s parents.\u201cFrom head to toe. Everything\u2019s worth a fortune.\u201d\u201cIs she alone? Is she a noble young lady?\u201dAs they continued the chatter, Viola only listened.\u201cYes, a noble lady that had no guardians are very expensive treasures.\u201dThey weren\u2019t really wrong either since the most favored slaves are the children of the fallen aristocracy.\u201cI think we need to deal with it quickly. The security of the winter castle is very good.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kidnap her and head south before the guards sniff it out.\u201dFour men started surrounding Viola.At the same time, she grinned before finally opening her mouth.\u201cMasked men\u2026\u201dHan Arin was a reader of this novel. She was confident that she knew more about Hera than Hera herself.With that thought in mind, Viola grabbed the hem of the skirt and bowed slightly.\u201cMy name is Viola Verratoux. I just turned seven this year.\u201dHan Arin decided to solve the novel in Han Arin\u2019s way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I turned seven this year.\u201dThis seemingly simple greeting included a stern warning, as Viola also revealed that she is a Verratoux.\u201cV-Verratoux?\u201d\u201cDid you say Verratoux?\u201dViola grinned inwardly.\u2018You mean you approached me without knowing I was Verratoux?\u2019She guessed they are mercenaries who are commissioned by Hera herself. They seemed to have been hired without knowing who their opponent would be.\u2018Well, a strong-minded mercenary wouldn\u2019t carry out this request.\u2019A mission to kidnap a child\u2014Those who try to kidnap and sell the powerless little girl of the fallen aristocracy as slaves are usually not properly trained mercenaries. Maybe, they had done a lot of evil hence why they have accepted this mission without alarm or much concern.The masked people, who were briefly flustered, soon burst into laughter as though they were dumbfounded.\u201cYou\u2019re Verratoux\u2026?\u201d\u201cA Verratoux is walking around this secluded place without an attendant? Hahaha!\u201d\u201cOf course, you\u2019re a Verratoux!\u201dThey did not believe Viola.\u201cFirst, I revealed that I was Verratoux, and secondly, I also revealed that I was seven years old.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth does this lady believe in to be so bold?\u201dThe masked men approached with a grin.\u201cHere, in Winter Castle under the strict orders of Duke Heron, every child under the age of ten is to be protected. Nevertheless, you have threatened me with weapons\u2026\u201dShe muttered softly.\u201c\u2026Trash.\u201dShe was sure they were literal trash, but she asked just in case.\u201cHow many children have you kidnapped and sold as slaves?\u201d\u201cAt least twenty.\u201dThey said it as if they were bragging. Then, one of them interrupted. \u201cNo, brother. Didn\u2019t we have a big one last time? I think it is over thirty.\u201d\u201cOh, it was.\u201dWell, kidnapping and slave sales seemed to be something to be proud of for them.He let out a laugh.\u201cEspecially, for cute children like you, we sell them at a high price.\u201dViola reached out her hand.\u201cXenon, clean water.\u201dAt that, something wriggled up from her shadow.The masked people were frightened. A state to which a person can be completely hidden in the shadows\u2014it was impossible thought by the masked people.\u201cHere.\u201dViola, who received the water bottle, washed her ears and her palm.\u201cI\u2019ve heard something too dirty.\u201d\u201cY-you! Who are you\u2026!\u201dShouting, the masked men pointed weapons at Xenon, although he just simply chuckled.Then, the man, who appeared to be a lot larger than the four, tilted his head.\u201cHo\u2026?\u201dEverything went by so fast that they couldn\u2019t even catch a glimpse of him. As they were feeling dizzy\u2026Flop.All their bodies collapsed onto the hard floor.No one was able to move.Everyone was poisoned. Their bodies didn\u2019t move, and even their mouths were stiffened still. It was as though they had turned hardened like a statue.\u201cThe one who fell was poisoned, and the other three who are paralyzed\u2026 I\u2019ll give you a choice.\u201dXenon continued with a grin.\u201cIn an hour. They are gonna die, anyway.\u201dOnly his voice echoed in the dead silence.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou may take your leave from Winter Castle in an hour. That way, I\u2019ll let the other three live.\u201dMurder in the Winter Solstice Castle is prohibited. Therefore, killing people in the castle would only complicate things.\u201cWhen I count down from ten, the poison will be released\u2014Ten, nine\u2026\u201dWhen the numbers are counted, moments after, Xenon snapped his finger.With that, the paralytic poison has been lifted as if it was a lie.\u201cChoose. Do you all want to die in poison, or do you want only one of you to die?\u201d\u201cI-I, I\u2019ll take my leave, then.\u201d\u201cThat would be in an hour.\u201d\u201cI-I see.\u201dShe held the fallen man. The other three started running.Viola said with a relaxed smile.\u201cSister, if you don\u2019t come out right now, I\u2019ll kill every one of the Terra Merchant.\u201dShe thought about it for a while, Viola had to adapt to this world.Words of warning are powerless, after all.She ate her heart out.\u201cAnd, Xenon, they should all be dead as soon as they get out of the Winter Castle.\u201dThe door to \u2018Moon Night\u2019 opened again.She could hear the wheelchair wheels rolling. There, Viola could see a silver-haired girl sitting in a wheelchair, and she came close with the thin arms rolling the wheels.\u201cYou promised not to bring the butler.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any mentions of you bringing such trash as well, sister?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring them. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve leaked information about the coming of a fallen aristocracy.\u201dViola grinned. She said something she didn\u2019t mean.\u201cYou should know that I brought the butler as an act, sister.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dShe then gazed at Xenon, as she tried to imitate the original Viola.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t bring the butler\u2026\u201dShe smiled.\u201cI would have killed them all.\u201dIf a pure-blood Verratoux commits murder in the Winter castle, the incident would have escalated way too quickly. A group of inspectors will come to the Duke\u2019s castle and get to the bottom of the case.\u201cI\u2019ve announced that I\u2019m Verratoux, and I\u2019ve already revealed that I\u2019m seven years old. Nevertheless, they threatened me. I would have killed them all, so it could be deducted as self-defense.\u201dViola wanted to cry.\u2018Damn it! My pronunciation is off again!\u2019Though luckily, Hera didn\u2019t notice it.\u201cI have to take some responsibility, but who\u2019s going to be in more trouble? The person who did this dirty, frivolous thing, which is unlike a Verratoux, would suffer the most, right? Won\u2019t your position be narrower? Rather, I think I would be praised.\u201dHera was speechless at the moment.Viola stood in front of her and made eye contact with Hera.\u201cI had a good view of my sister. I\u2019m still looking forward to you.\u201dViola in the original novel hates backhanded tricks. She thought ploys and tricks were just cowardly tricks. But, Han Arin did not think of it that way. Hera is doing the best she can, and she was one of the readers who supported Hera.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m keeping them alive.\u201dThe masked man, whose eyes met Viola, flinched. He didn\u2019t know why the seven-year-old\u2019s eyes were so ferocious. That look, obviously, was the eyes that killed a man. It was as though she was from a different race and was born differently.\u2018She is still young, but I feel like she\u2019d be a killer if she grew up a little more\u2026\u2019\u201cSister, why did you lie to me?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you call it a day since you brought your butler?\u201dHearing her words, Viola grinned slightly.\u201cYes, let\u2019s call it a day.\u201d\u2018I am a little relieved. I\u2019m glad I was a reader.\u2019Because she just came here without knowing anything. Viola almost panicked.\u201cI\u2019ll push you, then.\u201dAs she walked behind Hera, Xenon came close as well.\u201cI\u2019ll push her for you, Princess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. She\u2019s my sister.\u201dHera\u2019s body flinched.\u2018It\u2019s okay. She\u2019s my sister\u2026\u2019That didn\u2019t sound oddly bad\u2026Viola\u2019s appearance now and Viola\u2019s appearance before seemed to be different.\u2018No, she\u2019s really not different.\u2019Even if Viola showed embarrassment or stupidity, it\u2019s still all right. The phrase, \u2018she\u2019s my sister after all\u2019 she had said, wouldn\u2019t have come out so warmly.\u2018I must have been pathetic.\u2019Because of Viola\u2019s performance, she already proved her talent as an \u2018absolute person.\u2019 That\u2019s why her words sounded so warm. Even if it\u2019s the same word, it sounds completely different depending on who does it.Viola pushed the wheelchair.\u201cSo, where\u2019s the real Terra merchant?\u201dHera had a conversation with Viola. During the conversation, there was a particularly interesting part.Viola said, \u201cOf course, money is the best.\u201d\u201c\u2026Money?\u201d\u201cPeople need money. Money can call even ghosts.\u201d\u201cNo hesitation.\u201dHera burst into laughter.\u201cViola, you have become the Princess of the Duke.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSo, can you not use such vulgar language? Like, Money is the best?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like money, sister?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t not like it. Hera succeeded greatly based on her resourcefulness and craftsmanship, which later became an enormous merchant network.Viola knew that fact very well about Hera.[ \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking since I was a child.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t we nobles say that money is good?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of decency and appearance anyway?\u201d ]Hera answered honestly.\u201cNo, money is good.\u201d\u201cThen, you\u2019re also vulgar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201dAt her words, Hera had a subtle smile around her mouth. She concluded, \u201cYou\u2019re very unique.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThere must be a lot of crazy people in this world. Still, there\u2019s no one more unusual than a transmigrated one.That was what Viola really thought.\u201cDo you know why noblemen don\u2019t tell others they like money?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause they\u2019re full pigs. They never felt hungry, so they are just pretending to be prim and proper.\u201dAt that very moment, Hera then bursts into laughter with a \u2018kik!\u2019 sound.Viola felt as if she had a ray of light in her mind. \u2018This setting still existed in the original story\u2026\u2019\u300c When she talked to someone she really liked, she laughed out loud with a \u2018kik!\u2019 \u300dShe felt a little relaxed and recalled such a fact. Hera has finally now opened the door to her heart.Viola grinned without anyone knowing.\u2018There we go.\u2019This sister\u2026 She is definitely going to be on her side now. So, Viola decided to adapt what Hera said in the original book and drop a carpet bombing for her.Here we go, rich wannabe dreamer sister! There was also this in the novel.\u300c \u201d The idea of wanting to make money is an outdated way of thinking.\u201d \u300d\u201cIf you want to make money, you\u2019ll talk vulgarly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re vulgar?\u201d\u201cWell, money is precious.\u201dHan Arin, who has lived in Korean capitalist society, knows better. Money is important.\u201cHaving money doesn\u2019t make you happy, does it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe same was true for Viola. She became an adopted daughter, who would be sadder in this worldview. However, she couldn\u2019t just be happy.A death rivalry with her siblings.The male lead got kidnapped.Got threatened by masked men.\u201cEven with money, you can be unhappy. However, you know what it\u2019s like to have no money?\u201d\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cEverything is unfortunate. Even the lack of money is unfortunate. It\u2019s better to have money and be unfortunate than to have no money.\u201dHera burst into loud laughter with a \u2018kik!\u2019 again.\u201cThat\u2019s not what a noble lady would say. As a matter of fact, a noble lady should be able to endure even misfortune and feel the sweetness of hardship.\u201d\u201cHardship is still hardship. How do you even turn hardship into something sweet?\u201d\u201cYou make it through mental discipline and strong will.\u201d\u201cHm. Who said that?\u201d\u201cEveryone does.\u201d\u201cYou are out of your mind.\u201d\u201cAlso, poverty is not the standard of happiness.\u201dViola grinned.\u201cHave you starved before?\u201d\u201cYou must not have starved because you are a noble, right.\u201dHera\u2019s face is full of smiles. It was fun talking to Viola. There was no unique feeling of nobility, and it came very fresh to her.Viola continued without hesitation.\u201cWhat do you call that?\u201d\u201cWhat are you even saying?\u201d\u201cB*stards.\u201dShe lifted herself up and did not intend to be something she wasn\u2019t\u2026 That is the essential energy of the character Viola\u2014the energy that eats up life.\u201cI\u2019ll kill all those dogs, sister.\u201dJust in time, Xenon posted a report.\u201cI killed them all.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dViola did not reply.She felt uncomfortable and scared, though she could never let it show on her face. It looked to Hera that murder was nothing. Instead, she looked like a Verratoux Princess who was rather accustomed to murder.It\u2019s been a little while passed.Eventually, they arrived in front of a building\u2014the big building on the corner of the crossroads of seasons.Viola was stunned inside.\u201cNot a rich wannabe dreamer\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just a dream. Hera is already rich\u2026\u201cIs this\u2026 Is this your building, sister?\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a ten-story building.The world was a fantasy world, and although developed, magic engineering wasn\u2019t advanced enough to develop an architectural technology to build tall buildings.Rather than saying magic engineering here was inherently inferior to science and technology, it was because there was no need to raise the buildings higher than necessary in this wide expanse of land.\u2018Ten stories are really high\u2014\u2019It was rather difficult to compare simply like that, though she thought it could be compared to a seventy-story building in modern times. This was the largest building around here.Viola\u2019s heart was pounding.\u2018Building owner\u2026!\u2019There was a saying, the building owner was higher than the creator.\u2018But, she became the owner of a building at the age of twelve?\u2019She was a really fraudulent character in a sense. Even though she knew the original story after reading it, she felt even more desperate. Viola sternly made up her mind again, thinking they should definitely get along.\u201cI like you, sister, really, truthfully.\u201dAnd so, they went into the building of Terra Guild. There was a variety of people moving around inside.\u201cWho did you choose as the puppet boss?\u201d\u201cDo you even know what you are saying?\u201dBecause she came from the slums, Hera probably thought she didn\u2019t know anything.Still, the more Viola looked at it, the more amazing it was. She kept thinking that her father had brought her to Verratoux for nothing.\u201cThere was a prestigious merchant nearby.\u201dShe didn\u2019t say \u2018there is,\u2019 but \u2018there was.\u2019\u201cSo, what about now?\u201d\u201cDead.\u201dViola was appalled. This was not explained in detail in the original book. Just in case, she pulled herself together and asked again.\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dOf course, that\u2019s the nature of being a Verratoux, after all. They are cruel to the enemy, though they don\u2019t blindly kill people.\u201cHe was dead.\u201dHera continued in silence. \u201cSo, I buried him.\u201d\u201cThen, how\u2026\u201dViola, who went so far, seemed to realize.\u2018\u2026Sevan Marcos!\u2019That\u2019s right.The owner of the Guild of Terra\u2014the current owner, was Sevan Marcos. He could have skinned the face off a corpse and recreated exactly the same person. So, he seemed to be skinning his face and taking over the role of the owner.\u2018Wahh! I let my guard down for a second. Yeah\u2026 this is that world. I should never let my guard down.\u2019 Thinking so, Viola got her act together.\u201cWell, where is Sevan Marcos?\u201d\u201cSevan Marcos?\u201dHera turned her head and looked at Viola. After a moment, she laughed. She did not deny the fact.\u201cSo, that\u2019s how much you know of, huh?\u201dHera reached out her hand. Because of that, Viola held her hand unknowingly, then, Hera pulled her hand and placed it on her left chest.\u201cCan you feel it?\u201d\u201cHeartbeat?\u201d\u201cYes, you should know.\u201d\u2018What does she mean, \u2018I should know?\u2019 Viola was confused since Hera had said something completely mysterious once again.\u201cMy heartbeat is much faster than usual.\u201dOh, that\u2019s what she meant?\u201cI\u2019m a little happy that I met you, Viola.\u201dAlthough it was the situation she intended, Viola was also a little embarrassed. Still, Hera was into the category of relatively normal people for Verratoux members, and thus, she felt uncomfortable thinking she stole the child\u2019s hearts by using the content of the original.\u2018Is there a reason to be uncomfortable about it?\u2019She came back to her senses again.\u2018It\u2019ll be enough if we get along really well.\u2019A rich friend is a good friend. Among them, the owner of this guild, no, the owner\u2019s friend, was even better.So, Viola continued.\u201cIf possible, would it be better if the owner of the building grew bigger, right?\u201dHera exploded in laughter once again. She thought she could definitely be close friends with her and use the knowledge of the original to help her.\u2018Either way, Hers will do it on her own in the future.\u2019In addition, wouldn\u2019t it be better if she could move up that period a little bit?\u2018Then, we can get to know each other better. And she will be on my side!\u2019Soon after, Viola and Hera wandered around the building and got on the wagon.\u201cOlder sister.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cAre you rich?\u201dAt the question, Hera smiled brightly.\u201cWhy? Do you want to take my money? Did you become greedy after seeing my goods?\u201d\u201cWhat will I do with that small sum of money?\u201d\u2018Soon, Hera will become influential. She might be rich now, but she will be even richer in the future.\u2019\u201cWhat do you mean, a small amount of money? I\u2019m quite rich, though.\u201d\u201cYou are not rich.\u201dViola flatly denied it. It was true, compared to Hera in the future, she was almost a beggar as of now.Hearing her remarks, Hera met Viola\u2019s eyes, full of conviction. She then realized that the little girl in front of her was full of confidence.\u2018She\u2019s not kidding me, is she?\u2019Hera felt a little astonished inside.\u2018You must have seen the size of the building, but to say it\u2019s like a penny. It is said she grew up in the slums\u2026?\u2019Considering that, the determination on her mind seemed to be as big as a whale.Han Arin, who was likely to have a future chaebol friend, continued excitedly.\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is cash. Real assets and cash assets are different. Aren\u2019t you always short of cash?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why cash all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI want to join sister\u2019s business.\u201d\u2018You like me, and I like you. It\u2019s good for both of us, right?\u2019\u201cHow much do you have?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cSo, how do you join me then?\u201d\u201cHow much do you need, sister?\u201dIf she can give her the money, Hera would fall herself. She never lied or scammed anyone for money.\u201cIf I tell you how much, will you save it for me?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI want to invest in older sister.\u201dHera laughed out loud. She couldn\u2019t believe Viola said she wanted to invest in her and thought, \u2018What the hell does this kid believe in?\u2019\u201cWhat if I eat you up and betray you?\u201d\u201cThen, my eyes were wrong.\u201dNo, she won\u2019t do that. Viola knew that she was a character that never plays with money.Hera couldn\u2019t stop laughing, questioning where that confidence came from.\u201cHundred million Dalias.\u201dShe didn\u2019t mean she really needed a hundred million Dalias.In fact, for Hera, a hundred million Dalia was not even large enough to control her business. The amount of money was a realistic amount and symbolic number that Viola could produce, in Hera\u2019s opinion.\u201cA hundred million Dalias?\u201d\u201cYes, is it too much?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s less than I thought.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be that easy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have it for you.\u201dAt that, Hera stocked her chin and asked, \u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201dA few days later, Verratoux Family\u2019s finance butler went haywire.Xenon took out a white towel, wiped his forehead, and asked again.\u201cYou\u2019re going to visit the Duke in person?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHearing Viola\u2019s confident reply, he then wiped his forehead one more time. Even when Duchess Isabella grabbed his neck, he didn\u2019t even sweat this much.\u201cAs you know, the Duke is very busy, and he considers time more than gold.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dViola sat cross-legged. Her legs were short, and she could not reach the ground, though the atmosphere did not lag behind Duchess Isabella.\u201cThat\u2019s why he hates making unauthorized visits without making an appointment in advance.\u201d\u201cAnd, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking the butler to make an appointment.\u201d\u201cSo the reason you\u2019re making an appointment is\u2026 you\u2019re asking for money?\u201dXenon coughed once. He checked her intention just in case, but Viola nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI think my neck is going to be blown away, so could you reconsider it?\u201dHowever, she was adamant.Because of that, he sighed once with a look as if he had lost the world and closed the door. Xenon\u2019s expression, which was full of exaggeration, changed instantaneously. The crying figure in front of Viola disappeared all of a sudden.\u2018He must be in the study room at this time, right?\u2019He immediately found the Duke\u2019s study room.knock, knock.After knocking on the door, he went in.Sure enough, Duke Heron was working in his study room like a machine-like Duke who lived every day like a machine.\u201cDear Duke, Princess Viola wants me to tell you that she wants to see you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHeron, who was writing something with a quill pen, stared up at Xenon.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dHe smiled awkwardly and replied, \u201cShe\u2019s asking for some pocket money.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe quill stopped moving the moment he looked at Xenon. He smiled embarrassingly and added.\u201cAs expected, should I tell her the refusal?\u201d\u201cIf you were going to do that, you would have stopped her in the first place.\u201dConsequently, Xenon made a stand-up position.\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dHeron had a lot of faith in Xenon.\u201cCall her.\u201d\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201dAnd so, he went outside right away. Meanwhile, Carlton, who was standing behind Heron, opened his mouth.\u201cYou didn\u2019t get angry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Duke, above all else, a man who values time?\u201d\u201cHence, I\u2019d like you to shut up.\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dImmediately, Carlton shut his mouth. Heron began to sign the papers on the desk once again.The butler found the situation very difficult to understand.The Duke\u2019s attitude was a little unusual. He didn\u2019t like nonsense, and he hated those who wasted his time talking nonsense. So, what about that little girl making an unscheduled appointment and asking for pocket money? Nonetheless, the Duke accepted it.It was so strange.\u2018Is he going to call her and scold her?\u2019A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door.It was Princess Viola.Duke Heron sat in his chair and gazed at her.\u201cYou asked for pocket money, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola swallowed her saliva unconsciously.\u2018I don\u2019t know why father\u2019s atmosphere is so fierce.\u2019 It felt as if he was going to chew up the world with just his eyes.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI need some money.\u201dCarlton, the butler, was thinking it was outrageous. He\u2019d never seen a crazy Princess looking for pocket money in the Duke\u2019s office. He had never imagined a situation like this ever to happen.Viola glanced at Carlton confidently. She was so brazen that he wondered how she could be so confident.\u2018If she talks like that, she\u2019ll seriously be decapitated.\u2019 Carlton thought so. However, his assumption was wrong.This was a method used by Rael and was successful.\u300c \u201cI\u2019d like some pocket money, too.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI need some money.\u201d \u300dThe Duke liked her to be that shameless, surprisingly. Rather than plotting or doing something behind the scenes, he preferred it if they spoke directly right in front. Although because of the Duke\u2019s ferocious momentum and deep eyes, no one tried.Han Arin, a reader, dug deep into her favorite character, Heron, and knew how to treat him.\u201cFather made me his daughter, so I, as a daughter, should ask for some pocket money.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you came?\u201d\u201cAside from my allowance, I missed Father too.\u201dHeron paused for a moment at that.There was an awkward silence, and Carlton, the butler, had cold sweats all over his body.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His logical setting from the original novel could see through Viola\u2019s heart and sincerity.\u2018Did she mean it?\u2019Viola\u2019s eyes were full of sincerity. A very intense sincerity. In fact, it wasn\u2019t a wrong observation. Because Arin\u2019s virtuous desire to see her favorite character was real.\u2018Though there really is no reason, other than my sincere feelings for him.\u2019Heron squinted his eyes. He wanted to see himself as a father.\u2018I don\u2019t like that idea at all.\u2019Though the corners of his mouth rose slightly.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201dCarlton screamed inwardly. In the last fifteen years, he had never heard anything like that. He almost dropped the bunch of papers that were right in his hand.The Duke said with a grave look.\u201cHow much do you need?\u201d\u201cOne hundred million dalias.\u201dThe average monthly salary of ordinary people was about three million dalias. So, that amount of money was ordinary people\u2019s savings for three years without spending a single penny.However, this was Duke Heron.\u201cThat\u2019s the money I\u2019m supposed to get when I\u2019m twelve.\u201dSuccession candidates receive one million dalias when they turn twelve. It\u2019s up to the candidates how to spend it. She was asking him to receive it in advance.It was a request meant to do once in the Duchy.At least, that was the case for Hera. She reported in detail how the one million dalias would be invested. She didn\u2019t ask for it recklessly.\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to make money.\u201d\u201cSo, you want to use leverage?\u201dThis refers to an investment strategy where borrowed capital (liabilities) is drawn to increase profits from asset investment and then purchased assets.Perhaps his young daughter was instinctively aware of the concept of leverage.\u201cYes, I\u2019m trying to empower Hera.\u201dAfter bringing Hera to her side, Viola decided to get along with the Medeia Line, the First Princess. That way, she had a high probability of a happy ending.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it also Verratoux-like to build a capable ally? I thought it would be better to have Hera on my side because she couldn\u2019t be the heir.\u201dViola continued. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not asking for it for free.\u201d\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d\u201cApril is just around the corner. It\u2019s time for the hoard of wild boars to rise, and I heard Maple Village always suffers a lot of damage.\u201d\u201cYou seem to have studied hard.\u201d\u201cYes. Otherwise, my neck will be cut off.\u201dThe Duke grinned unconsciously. He liked it when Viola was confident and brazen. Gazing at the child, her peachy cheeks caught his eyes again.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll solve the problem of the wild boar. Would that prove my ability?\u201d\u201cAre you confident?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMy time is precious.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dViola swallowed her saliva and continued. \u201cIf I fail, I\u2019ll give you my neck.\u201dCarlton coughed again.\u2018Princess Viola seems to have gone a little too far. What do you mean, giving up your neck?\u2019 Thinking so, he opened his mouth carefully.\u201cYou can\u2019t say such a thing like that, Princess.\u201dWhat if she failed? If Duke would really kill Viola. And beheading his daughter shortly after adopting her would inspire vicious rumors among people.Winter Castle and Duke Heron\u2019s prestige would seriously be compromised.Moments later, Duke Heron opened his mouth again.\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201cGive and take, that\u2019s what you like isn\u2019t it?\u201dViola was flabbergasted, so her reply was Arin\u2019s customized conversation method. She reached out her hand.\u201cGive me the money first. I have more weight on the line.\u201d\u2018I risked my life, so Father should give me the money first.\u2019That was what she meant.The Duke looked at Viola\u2019s hand. Her hands were tiny and dainty. Asking for one hundred million dalias as pocket money with those dainty palms\u2026\u201cDid you say one hundred million dalias?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you two hundred million dalias.\u201dSaying so, Duke Heron\u2019s eyes drew a line.The Duke paused as he was signing the papers.\u201cAs an excuse for my allowance, I really missed you, father.\u201dShe will take the concept of leverage and invest in Hera. Duke Heron thought Viola\u2019s choice was not so wrong. Rather, it was a good choice because a debt that one can afford is another asset. Heron\u2019s thoughts went directly to that part.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Originally, it was right to focus on that part, but other things kept catching his attention.The small hand that looked like a fern came to his mind.He didn\u2019t know the reason, though why does only that presumptuous hand come to mind?\u2018Her hand\u2014\u2019He grinned unconsciously.\u2018It was very small.\u2019He felt like it would crumble if he held it tightly, like dried leaves.It was strange.He kept thinking of her peach-like cheeks, and now he even remembered her eating those egg tarts. Then, he suddenly felt bad.\u2018Why is she so soft\u2026?\u2019Thinking about it, she looked too frail. Perhaps it was because he remembered Rael\u2019s brazen and confident appearance.So, he ordered,\u201cWatch Viola.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf she really deceives me\u2026\u201dHeron Verratoux spoke like Verratoux, like the true master of the Winter Castle.\u201cIf she does not produce satisfactory results at the age of ten, we will no longer discuss her qualifications as heir.\u201dShe would then be consumed as an offering to stimulate the purebloods, as per the true purposes of adoptive daughters.\u201c\u2026Very well.\u201dThe Duke stood for a moment and gazed out of the window.The weather was good. The sky was cloudless, and the warm sunshine was seeping through the window. Far below, Viola was seen strolling with her short legs. Her steps looked very light as if she felt happy after receiving her pocket money.Duke Heron thought back again. He couldn\u2019t admit that he had let his guard down.\u2018You\u2019ll have to do a good job.\u2019The Duke\u2019s eyes harbored an eerie light within them.\u2018\u2026Otherwise, your neck won\u2019t survive.\u2019He made up his mind. Even if it had been three years already, he still wouldn\u2019t admit to her strength.Soon after, spring came to Winter Castle, and Viola turned ten years old.Ten years old in the Winter Castle has a special meaning.From the age of ten, she would have no protection from the absolute law of Winter Castle. So, anyone else would have nothing to say even if she was attacked outside the Winter Castle.However, the most excited person of all was Prince Vixen.Clash!The door opened with a loud thud.\u201cViola! I\u2019m back from my mission!\u201dVixen, who turned eleven, grew up beautifully before she knew it. He had been outside the castle for the past five months. Besides, he had also done a great job on his mission.\u201cDid you come here as soon as you finished your mission?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u2018Please don\u2019t answer me so brightly.\u2019\u201cDid you report it to Father?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to do it now.\u201d\u2018Don\u2019t lie! I could see that you are getting prickly.\u2019\u201cYou are going to leave it to the butler, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cN- no. Why would I?\u201d Vixen said, as he rubbed his nose and laughed.There had also been a big change in Vixen over the past three years. He was now much more flexible than the original Vixen.At least, for Viola.Viola stood up from her chair.\u201cBrother.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you still want to crush me and win the race for succession?\u201dVixen flinched and then shuddered.\u201cOf- of course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ten years old now, and brother can legally compete with me for succession.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d\u201cTo do so, I want you to perform that role properly as the fifth young Lord.\u201dFor Viola, Vixen had to be a strong ally. And as an ally, he had to grow properly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t behave like the fifth Prince of Verratoux\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026If I don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t recognize you as a competitor.\u201dAs she finished her words, Vixen looked as if he had lost the whole world.\u201cSo, Brother. Go ahead and give the report first.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201dVixen banged the door and hurriedly closed it again. To twenty-one-year-old Arin, he was still a child.Xenon, who was standing next to her, grinned.\u201cPrince Vixen really wanted to see Princess Viola first.\u201d\u201cDid he look like that to you too, Xenon?\u201d\u201cYes, but the funny thing is, he\u2019s lost a lot of liveliness in his eyes.\u201d\u201cYou think so as well?\u201d\u201cYes, his curiosity towards Princess Viola remains the same, but I think there is a gap between his reasoning and emotions.\u201dIt was as if his reason seemed to be saying, \u2018You have to fight in a life-or-death battle with Viola!\u2019 even as his emotions seemed to be thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t want to fight Viola.\u2019\u201cDid the Princess intend that to happen?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dViola mumbled her reply. It was right that she had been working hard for the past three years and she thought it\u2019s going well as she anticipated, or even better. And now, Vixen is finally back from his long-term mission.It was time for a new chapter to unfold.\u2018May twelfth.\u2019Winter Castle had very short spring, summer, and autumn seasons. The seasons changed dramatically in a short time.The month of May was considered spring, the month of June was considered summer, and the month of July was considered autumn. Moreover, the next chapter was \u2018Spring Garden.\u2019A secret encounter between Viola, a ten-year-old prominent aspiring murderer, and Heron, a sinister Duke, the punishment from heaven.* Here Viola clarified her course.[tl/n: \ucc9c\uc0b4 comes from the theory of the 12 Shinsal, and means an unavailable disaster or a sinister fate.]Through this chapter, she was reborn as the true Viola Verratoux and declared a successor. Viola, in the original book, affirmed her identity by saying this.[\u201cMy father is the sinister Duke, so I\u2019ll be even greater.\u201d]Finally, May twelve arrived.In May, the Duke used to meditate by taking a 30-minute walk in the Duke\u2019s residence flower garden. This was also the place where he had walked with his beloved Rael.\u201cFather.\u201dViola and Duke Verratoux met in the garden where pink flowers bloomed.\u201cDid you come here on purpose?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dShe did it differently, unlike the original Viola.\u201cI remember this day three years ago.\u201d\u201cThree years ago?\u201dOn that day three years ago. It was the day when Viola proudly asked the Duke for one hundred million dalias.\u201cWhat Father said to the butler on that day, shall I guess?\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

DO NOT STEAL MY TRANSLATION!Three years ago, the Duke had said, \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t produce satisfactory results by the age of ten, we will no longer discuss her qualifications as heir.\u201dAnd three years later Viola stood before the Duke.\u201cIf I don\u2019t achieve proper results at the age of ten, I\u2019ll be disqualified as a successor or expelled, right?\u201d\u201cYou said it exactly.\u201d\u201cThen, now that three years have passed. What do you think about that command?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it proven? Seeing that you\u2019re still alive.\u201dHeron Verratoux kept thinking the chat was very annoying throughout the conversation.\u201cI told Father at the time that I\u2019ll protect Maple Village, a granary, from the wild boars.\u201d\u201cYou have fulfilled that promise very well.\u201d\u201cThough I did it in a very unusual way, why didn\u2019t Father ask me anything?\u201dThe hoard was driven away, but she did it in a different way than Heron Verratoux. More precisely, she had chosen symbiosis instead. The reason why the wild boars were forced to come out was that there was nothing to eat in the hills.And that was the part Viola had taken advantage of.\u201cI created a hybrid of red-mouth worms and tooth moles in a special environment, which fertilized the soil of the hills.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHeron Verratoux knew all about it, though he didn\u2019t disclose it publicly.\u201cAs the soil becomes fertile, the boars are now rich in food. Thus, they no longer had to come down to the village.\u201dBack then, many people were worried. As the number of wild boars increased, wouldn\u2019t they invade the village again? Even then, sometimes, wild boars that had mutated into demon beasts appeared, and the anxiety reached its peak.\u201cSince then, the ecosystem has been balanced as the snow leopard, an intermediate predator of the Kant Mountains, migrated its habitat.\u201d\u201cDo you want to celebrate your achievements?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dViola squatted down, then she saw a flower in full bloom.At first glance, the flower was so similar to the rose of Sharon and covered the garden in its mysterious hue that is combined with pink and purple. Bees were flying through the yellow flower liquor. The petals and green stems swaying in the wind were like a gentle wave.[tl/n: The mugunghwa, or the rose of Sharon, it\u2019s the national flower of South Korea. Meaning \u201ceternal blossom that never fades,\u201d it has been an important symbol of Korean culture for centuries.]\u2018Pretty\u2026\u2019It was very different from the description in the novel. The novel didn\u2019t do justice to the real scenery.Viola\u2019s hair fluttered freely in the wind. Heron Verratoux gazed at the girl in front of him. It was like a scene in a frame portrayed peacefully.She then opened her mouth, gazing at the flower garden with warm eyes, which was very different from the usual.\u201cIn fact, what I\u2019ve done is great. I heard that some scholars are looking for the origin of \u2018tooth worms\u2019 with their eyes burning in admiration. It was a coincidence, but anyway, I left a mark in biosynthesis magic engineering.\u201dHeron frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re taking too long.\u201d\u201cBut, why didn\u2019t Father make it public?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it is an opportunity to promote my achievements as a Verratoux.\u201dShe was able to read Heron\u2019s mind.\u2018Viola is going to be the \u2018Dark Verratoux\u2019.\u2019The Verratoux Family was divided into two main strength pillars.The Dark Verratoux was in charge of the military force. In comparison, White Verratoux was in charge of resourcefulness. What Viola accomplished three years ago was closer to White Verratoux than Dark Verratoux.Using life-mado engineering, chimeras were created, and natural ecosystems were restored through them. So, instead of exterminating wild boars, she found a harmonic result in a better way.However, Heron did not elaborate on that fact.\u201cFather wants me to be the Dark Verratoux, right?\u201d\u201cDo you remember why I adopted you?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s because of my talent.\u201dTalent for murder. Because of that, she was adopted and became \u2018Viola Verratoux.\u2019She smiled lightly.\u201cThough, Dad\u2026\u201dViola\u2019s tone was always strange. One minute she would call him \u2018father\u2019 with courtesy, but at some point, she had called him \u2018dad.\u2019 Heron was unfamiliar with the title \u2018Dad\u2019 although her tone was so natural and didn\u2019t come across as uncomfortable.No. Rather, the \u2018dad\u2019 came out as a good thing. It felt essentially different from the other children.\u201cYou recognized my talent.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cHowever, what if I am more talented as a White Verratoux than the one you thought?\u201d\u201cViola, your Dark Verratoux talent is comparable to Medea.\u201dHeron said it all honestly.\u201cWhen I brought you, you were the nourishment of my own children. I hoped they would be stimulated by you and your extraordinary talent.\u201d\u201cI knew that, but it\u2019s shocking to hear it in person.\u201dTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t. She knew it from the beginning. It was a shock to possess someone else\u2019s body, not to be adopted by such a father.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want you to grow up to be a Dark Verratoux.\u201d\u201cEven if my talent as a White Verratoux is much greater?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job as a Black Verratoux since the first day of adoption.\u201dHer encounter with Xenon along with Vixen. To her relationship with Hixen and Tundra until her welcoming dinner.\u201cWhat if I want to go against Father\u2019s will and set my course in White Verratoux?\u201dWhite Verratoux was responsible for the Verratoux Family\u2019s resourcefulness.Estate affairs along with strategies. For example, they were in charge of the department division related to money management.If Dark Verratoux takes care of all external affairs, White Verratoux takes care of all internal affairs.At first glance, both seemed essential, but in reality, they weren\u2019t.\u201cWhite Verratoux is a difficult direct-line assignment. I\u2019m sure you know that, aren\u2019t you?\u201dVerratoux is an iron-blooded Duchy, a family whose force is more important than resourcefulness. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that few volunteers become White Verratoux.When one was defeated in the succession race or judged that their strength was insufficient. At that time, they accepted the position of White Verratoux.Although they have real power within the family, they were unfortunate supporting actors who spend their whole lives subject to the ignorance and disdain of the Dark Verratoux. Instead, they were given preferential treatment that wasn\u2019t really preferential treatment.\u2018They can avoid a slaughter race with their siblings.\u2019Dark Verratoux faces a bloody heir rivalry between their siblings. A White Verratoux needs no such competition. It meant that even though they would be ignored by their siblings, they would not be put to death.\u2018It\u2019s better to be despised than to die like a dog!\u2019Viola continued, \u201cI think I have fully proved my talent and qualities as a Dark Verratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHeron Verratoux could not deny it. The memories of the welcome dinner were still entrenched in his mind.\u201cSo\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m running away from the succession race?\u201dThat was the opposite response of Viola in the original story. There, Viola, in the original work, clearly promises to grow as a Dark Verratoux.\u201cA good general can decapitate several enemy captains.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, an outstanding strategist as General, who takes control of military discipline, manages troops, and organizes military operations, can bring down the King and the entire enemy army.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf my hands and feet can kill a hundred, my head and mouth can kill ten thousand.\u201dThough the process was completely different, nevertheless, the conclusion was still the same.[\u201cMy father is the sinister Duke, so I\u2019ll be even greater.\u201d]\u201cMy father is the sinister Duke, so I\u2019ll be even greater.\u201d<b>* * * *</b>Heron returned to his study room and meditated for a long time.\u201cI can kill ten thousand people, but I will save another ten thousand of my people.\u201dViola, who was talking to him, was holding the flower in one of her hands. It felt like a small treasure island floating alone amid the green waves.\u2018White Verratoux, huh\u2026\u2019In history, few volunteered for White Verratoux as soon as they turned ten years old. One of them was Hera, and the other was Viola.He expected that much from Hera, but he didn\u2019t even know that Viola would do this herself.Making up his mind, he called Xenon.\u201cXenon, three years ago\u2026 You know Viola got two hundred million dalias, right?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019ve already made a detailed report. Would you like it?\u201dAt that time, Heron deliberately did not ask to receive the report.After turning ten, it was to make a proper evaluation. It also meant that he would not look at the process, but rather focus on the results.\u201cBring it.\u201dXenon reported as if he had prepared it in advance. Heron, who had been reading the data for a long time, groaned unknowingly.For the past three years: How Viola used the two hundred million dalias. What happened as a result\u2026 All the details about her were written down.Xenon grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s not because she\u2019s the Princess I serve, but she\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201c\u2026Bring Viola here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs he went to fetch Viola from her room, Xenon noticed that Viola\u2019s hands were very dirty. He didn\u2019t know what she did, though there was a lot of dirt on her hands.\u201cWould you like me to wipe them?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201dViola, escorted by Xenon, headed to the Duke\u2019s office together.\u201cDid you report about me to Father?\u201d\u201cYes, the Duke asked about it first.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u2018The time has come.\u2019 She had decided to tell him exactly what and how she had done over the past three years. Then, Duke Heron would never object to her being a White Verratoux. The cause, the benefit, she brought it all.Eventually, they arrived at the Duke\u2019s office. Xenon opened the door, and Viola walked slowly to the Duke\u2019s desk.The Duke spoke to Viola without even looking up from the papers.\u201cBehind your back, what are you hiding?\u201dThe Duke\u2019s mood rapidly deteriorated. There was no way that she had memorized it, and even if she did, to hide it openly like that was disqualification as a Verratoux.As she hesitated for a moment, Duke Heron\u2019s eyes became sharp.\u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201dThe air around them seemed to turn into needles. Instead of air, it felt like a needle was poking into her skin.\u201cThis.\u201dShe brought out a wreath she was hiding behind her back. It was a wreath made of flowers.\u201cI made it because I thought Dad would like it.\u201dIt was the sort of gift that the Duke had never received in his life. So, obviously, he didn\u2019t expect to receive something like that from his adopted daughter.\u201cI thought it would look good on you.\u201dAfter Viola finished her words, the air around him suddenly shifted and the invisible needles pointed at her disappeared.\u201cDid I make a mistake?\u201dThe Duke only gazed at Viola for a long time.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

DO NOT STEAL MY TRANSLATION!\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s an actual gift.\u201d\u201cThis kind of thing?\u201d\u2018What do you mean you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s an actual gift? Waaahh, look at this father of mine while talking. I can\u2019t take this. It looks like I\u2019m going to have to scold him with a piece of a wreath.\u2019Viola strolled towards Heron with the wreath. She didn\u2019t move stealthily as if she was going to spray water on him nor did she move hesitantly, rather, she just walked normally.The daughter walking towards her father didn\u2019t look like the sinister Duke\u2019s Princess.\u201cI worked hard doing it while thinking about you, Father.\u201dShe then put out her hands and showed them. Standing before Heron, she showed her muddy hands. She was much smaller than Heron, who was in the chair.Viola lifted her tiptoes and placed the wreath on Heron\u2019s head.She laughed and clapped her hands.\u201cYou look so good.\u201d\u2018Of course, he\u2019s my favorite character. I can\u2019t believe he looks that good with a flower crown. You look like you came out of a romance manga, Dad!\u2019Heron Verratoux and a crown made of flowers. These two things were an incongruous combination that actually suited each other.Heron didn\u2019t say anything.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018I\u2019m in a bad mood.\u2019No. It wasn\u2019t like he felt that way rather\u2026\u2018I think I should be in a bad mood.\u2019No\u2026\u2018Do I have to be in a bad mood?\u2019Heron Verratoux was a little confused by this sort of child he had never experienced before. Eventually, he opened his mouth with a serious look on his face.\u201cA man doesn\u2019t do fancy things like this.\u201dOh my.\u2018We\u2019re talking about fantasy worldly stuff here, my \u2018oh-so-favorite\u2019 character.\u2019\u201cYou look too good for that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cReally pretty.\u201dA normal lady in a typical noble family wouldn\u2019t express themselves directly like that. They especially don\u2019t say that to men. Because they think it\u2019s vulgar.Then, Viola laughed.\u201cIt was worthy.\u201dHe looked at his daughter\u2019s hands covered in dirt. Seeing her like that, he felt a lump in his chest. Heron raised his hand silently and touched the crown.\u201cYou sure laugh a lot.\u201dAt that moment, Viola shot him a bloodthirsty glare.It had been three years since she possessed Viola\u2019s body.Viola was a dream-like character, a promising child born to be a murderer. \u2018Thanks to this genius body, this much is possible for me \u2018She opened her mouth with a smirk.\u201cYou know how I usually look.\u201dShe didn\u2019t look like that often. After the welcome dinner, Viola was nicknamed the Iron-Blood Princess. Rumor said that even if she was Verratoux\u2019s adoptive daughter, she acted more like Verratoux more than anyone else, and she played her role vehemently.Heron was well aware of that fact, too. So, he didn\u2019t deny it.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe calmed her expression once again.It was this very hand that held out a single egg tart three years ago. Now, she laughed again, reaching out her muddy hand.\u201cI am just like this in front of you, Dad!\u201dViola smiled brightly like the sun.\u201cOnly in front of my dad. Can\u2019t I? I won\u2019t forget that I\u2019m Verratoux. But, in front of Dad, I can act like a daughter!\u201dIn her third year of possessing this body, Viola had perfectly adapted to this fantasy world.<b>* * * *</b>Carlton was the butler of Duke Verratoux.It was no exaggeration to say that Heron Verratoux absolutely trusted him, and except for the Duchess, he was now the second-in-command of the Duchy.Hence, he had quite a privilege. Carlton could enter the Duke\u2019s main Office without knocking if he delivered information that was extremely valuable or urgent.This method was the product of war, because knocking was like a luxury on the battlefield, even for a second. And that tradition has continued through and through.Creak.The door of the Main Office opened. Carlton was breathing heavily.\u201cGasp\u2026 Gasp\u2026\u201dCarlton\u2019s gaze was fixed on something.\u201cDuke\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Duke didn\u2019t reply, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.As if it was nothing, Heron placed his hand on his head with a very calm expression and relaxed manner. His head was covered with a flower crown, a wreath made of rugosa roses.He slowly removed the wreath and placed it on the desk with careful hands, in case it may be ruined.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCarlton had to doubt his eyes.\u2018Was the Duke wearing a flower crown?\u2019If anyone else had seen it, Duke Verratoux\u2019s prestige would have been damaged. There was a flower crown upon the very head of the famous sinister Duke.A wreath! On the head of the man called the punishment of heavens!\u2018In addition, is he even flustered right now?\u2019Carlton, who had been serving the Duke for a long time, could feel it. On the surface, it seemed like nothing, but the Duke was embarrassed.He couldn\u2019t believe it and didn\u2019t want to believe it. It felt like Carlton\u2019s world was slowly collapsing.\u201cIs it a report urgent enough that needs an immediate response?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not.\u201dIt was also related to Viola\u2019s report.\u201cIt is also related to Princess Viola. Shall we see it right away?\u201dHeron asked about Viola.\u201cShe said she wanted to be a White Verratoux. At this point, I can guess what you have to report so urgently, Carlton.\u201dHe then continued,\u201cAnd, three years ago, I think it would be related to the whereabouts of the two hundred million Dalias?\u201dAfter finishing his words, he turned to the butler. Meanwhile, Carlton, who had earlier doubted his eyes, now had to doubt his ears.\u2018\u2026White Verratoux?\u2019Viola Verratoux, the iron-blooded Princess? That Verratoux, who was even more Verratoux than anyone else, wants to become a White Verratoux?\u201cCarlton, that\u2019s not like you.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe hurriedly answered with a slight bow.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s related to the two hundred million Dalias.\u201d\u201cThen, Viola, why don\u2019t you tell me first?\u201dViola nodded her head.Three years ago.Viola said to Hera,\u201cI have two hundred million Dalias. Two hundred million Dalias in cash. You can borrow a hundred million Dalias from the Imperial Bank with my cash as collateral.\u201dAnd, of course, she did just that. Viola borrowed another hundred million Dalias as collateral, and she handed it to Hera. Since what she asked for was one hundred million Dalias only.\u2018The remaining two hundred million Dalias will be used to buy land in the Shaikh wasteland.\u2019The Shaikh wasteland.It was a forest between Winter Castle and the southern metropolitan city of Garnia. Because it was abandoned land, it was not worth using at all.\u201cThe land, collectively called the Shaikh wasteland, was barren and unsuitable for farming. Besides, sometimes leopards roamed there, hence it was of no utility value.\u201d\u201cYes, deacons in the Treasury department even throw up.\u201dViola turned to Carlton.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the market price now?\u201d\u201c\u2026Now, the official land price in the Empire has risen more than seven times, and market prices have risen more than ten times.\u201dSimply put, two hundred million Dalias have become two billion Dalias.\u201cBut, no one has given up the land, so the value is still soaring. However\u2026 most of the parcels are owned by Princess Viola.\u201dHearing his words, she nodded her head and said.\u201cDid I finally prove my qualification as a White Verratoux?\u201d\u201cWhy did you buy the land there?\u201d\u2018Because I saw it all in the novel.\u2019Viola swallowed her smile.\u300c The Emperors of the Empire have deliberately isolated the Winter Castle. \u300dIt was a deliberate and political decision.Making Winter Castle and continental communication too smooth creates two risks. In addition, it was also contributing to help assist the Winter Solstice Castle collapse.Since it was easy for the creatures to invade the continent from the \u2018snowy place.\u2019Or when Verratoux of Winter Solstice Castle decided to rebel. The Verratoux were dangerous people.So, instead of giving Verratoux the honor of always being the \u2018strongest shield of the Empire.\u2019Winter Castle had always been left in a barren and dangerous place.\u201cWinter Solstice castle has always been lonely. I understand. It\u2019s a political decision. The more isolated and lonely they make the Winter Castle, the more courageous the warriors of the winter castle, including Verratoux, become.\u201dPeople in the Winter Castle were born different. They protect mankind from the snow.Therefore, people from Winter Castle lived with their own pride. With that sense of duty of becoming stronger warriors. Therefore, they didn\u2019t aim their swords at the empire.Since birth, their enemies had been the monsters from the \u2018snowy place.\u2019\u201cWe are beneficial to the Empire. We keep the people out of harm\u2019s way and prevent those from plotting treason.\u201d\u201cWhat does it have to do with the two hundred million Dalias?\u201dShe then turned to Carlton.\u201cCan I have some paper and a pen, please?\u201dAt her request, he gave her a paper and pen, and she drew a rough map.\u201c\u2026so, if you draw a vertical axis between the stronghold cities and the Winter Solstice Castle, this is the perfect place.\u201dThere were several stronghold cities scattered around the vertical axis.\u201cIn the end, connectivity with cities is important to develop cities and roads. When cities are connected, the synergy explodes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHence, I bought a lot of land in the Shaikh wasteland. It was very cheap because it was abandoned land. And as you can see, this is what happened.\u201dShe turned her eyes to Carlton. He coughed awkwardly and continued his report.\u201cJust before, the Empire officially announced it. It announced that it would build a huge trade road from the continent\u2019s central city of Monarch to the Winter Solstice castle.\u201dViola continued talking.\u201cThree years ago, an outstanding secretary of state of the Empire began to rule, right?\u201dHe was a great person who sought the well-being of the Empire and the well-being of the people, rather than political reasons. His name is Sellina.At the young age of thirty-seven, he became the Minister of Finance and took charge of one of the pillars of the Empire.\u201cConsidering his actions, he always did it for the people. Even in the slums, you can hear songs about him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI expected that one day that person would persuade the Emperor to make a way for the Winter Castle and the Empire. That\u2019s the way for the Empire.\u201d\u201cIs that the only reason?\u201d\u201cNo, it should be in the report given by Xenon. The Empire\u2019s growth rate was negative, and inflation was seen in the forecast. There\u2019s a lot of money in the market, but the direction of the money hasn\u2019t been decided. The value of the currency continues to fall\u2026\u201dAs a result,\u201cIt was decided that the Empire would try to boost the economy through massive civil engineering work.\u201dViola smiled brightly and concluded her words, \u201cI thought that would be about three years from now.\u201d\u2018Of course, that\u2019s all that I saw in the novel. Exactly today. The day of the official announcement in the Empire.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s why at this point, I said I\u2019d be a White Verratoux. What do you think?\u201dHeron and Carlton shut their mouths at the same time.She was a ten-fold medium because she was a good talker and a whopping 1,000% in terms of yield. In particular, Carlton, the butler, was in utter shock and couldn\u2019t say anything.\u2018She made two hundred million Dalias into two billion Dalias\u2026\u2019And, it\u2019s still rising.Leaving Carlton alone in shock, Viola continued.\u201cStill, I won\u2019t do it all for the sake of the Empire like Sellina.\u201dSellina was a warm person, but not everyone could do that for the sake of the entire Empire.\u201cI mean, it can be done in a somewhat coercive and fast way.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a democratic society. It was a world where the Emperor and King\u2019s power soared to the sky.\u201cSo, if the powerless held the land, they might have been evacuated. It may have been removed without a single mouse or a bird\u2019s knowledge.\u201dViola laughed again. Her gaze towards her father was filled with trust.\u2018Whaa\u2026 At times like this, it\u2019s reliable, my dad is Duke Heron.\u2019\u201cBut, I\u2019m your daughter.\u201dThe pinnacle of Verratoux. He was Heron Verratoux, the owner of the Winter Castle and Shield of the North. Therefore, the land purchased by his daughter couldn\u2019t be recklessly taken away. They couldn\u2019t assassinate his daughter.\u201cEven the Emperor of the Empire cannot take it away. My father is Heron Verratoux.\u201dShe held her skirt and bowed down.\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m your daughter.\u201dHidden under his desk, Heron\u2019s fingertips shivered subtly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a small picture frame on the desk. There was a figure of Rael that was photographed through a magic camera.The Duke pondered on his memories with Rael.\u2018I\u2019m glad I\u2019m your wife. Only I can own you.\u2019The Duke looked at Rael\u2019s picture without hesitation. The image of Viola did not disappear from his mind.\u2018That child\u2026\u2019He felt it from a long time ago. She resembled Rael in some way. He even felt this way.\u2018Don\u2019t be lonely anymore, is she the child Rael sent to me\u2026?\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019There was no connection between Rael and Viola. He just adopted Viola as a hand to use and throw away.But, there were some strange things.\u2018Why are nostalgic feelings dripping from the potion?How did she read the feelings he missed from the potion? How could a child who did not know Rael find out about such things by just looking at the potions?\u2018Longing for someone. Love greater than death. and earnest desire. I see it.\u2019At this point, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Rael appeared in Viola\u2019s dream and taught her everything.\u2018Rael\u2026\u2019Tears welled up in the Duke\u2019s eyes. He prayed tens of thousands of times for her to be by his side, but God didn\u2019t hear him.The Duke eventually got up from his seat.He opened the door to the secret safe. There was a flower ring preserved by the finest preservation magic.\u2018Rael. You used to give me a sweet briar.\u2019In a secret space that no one knew about, Rael had weaved a flower ring for the Duke.Each time the Duke would blush his face.\u2018Men don\u2019t do this.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not man, it\u2019s my husband who does this.\u2019Rael\u2019s smile that day was so pretty.It\u2019s because he was happy that Rael was happy. So, in front of Rael, he always wore the flower ring. Every time.Rael liked to clasp his hands.\u2018It fits you very well. It\u2019s pretty.\u2019It was a secret that only Heron and Rael knew, which no one in the Duchy family knew. But, if he looks at what Viola is doing, she looks just like Rael.\u2018It suits you too well for that.\u2019\u2018Dad is very handsome.\u2019\u2018Ignorant worship.\u2019His reason continued to refuse. However, emotions kept making him think differently.Viola felt like a child Rael had sent for him.\u2018Useless thoughts\u2026\u2019Heron put the sweet briar flower in the secret safe, and once again at Rael.As he gazed at the picture. Somehow today\u2026It felt like Rael was smiling.\u2018I miss you.\u2019Does Rael miss him, too?Does she want to see the bold adopted daughter?The Duke himself did not know.Hera smashed the strawberries with a fork,\u00a0kuak!She hit it so hard, the juice burst all around.Pang!\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cYes, crazy.\u201d\u201cWhy are you volunteering for a white Veratoux?\u201d\u201cI said I did it before. Is your head bad?\u201dIt was true.A year ago, Viola had spoken to Hera in advance. That she\u2019d be a white Veratoux. Naturally, Hera did not take her words seriously.\u201cI thought it was meant to mock the white Veratoux.\u201d\u201cOlder sister is a white Veratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSister is my people. So, why am I making fun of the white Veratoux?\u201dShe stared into Viola\u2019s vivid eyes. Hera looked at those vivid eyes and took a deep breath,\u00a0tak, she felt choked.\u201cSometimes, I get confused.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou have such vivid eyes in front of me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just in front of sister.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI do it in front of both sister and father.\u201dOnly two in the world.Hera felt very good about it, but she spoke bluntly.\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re the iron-blooded Veratoux. The adopted daughter who is more Veratoux than anyone else. The youngest Veratoux who declared war on the Veratoux during the welcome dinner.\u201dViola at the welcome dinner still remains as a Duchy\u2019s legend.It would probably be recorded largely in the history books of Veratoux. As such, the appearance of Viola Veratoux gave a great shock to the Duchy.\u201cYeah, it was.\u201d\u201cBut why? Why the white Veratoux?\u201dHera was so frustrated that she thought she was going to die. Never in history has the white Veratoux seized power. No matter how good you are.Hera knew exactly the limits of the white Veratoux.\u201cSister. Do you believe in me?\u201d\u201cUntil now, I believed!\u201dViola that Hera saw was an outstanding resourceful person. She solved the herd of wild boars that plagued Maple Village in a harmonious way, and she bought a lot of land, and drew a huge investment profit.\u201cI heard you recently subjugated a group of bandits.\u201d\u201cYes, what. Did you?\u201dThe exact inside story was a little different.She went with Hickson, who is now a complete human, and Tundra, the male lead inside the novel.Tundra, which has made remarkable progress, alone killed seven bandits, and Hickson killed three.Viola simply just watched.\u201cThe head of that bandit was an Imperial Knight, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a regular knight, I think it was an apprentice.\u201d\u201cAnyway! Do you think it\u2019s easy to subdue a band of bandits with more than ten people?Why does a younger brother with such abilities take the course with a white Veratoux instead of a black one!Why did you rot that great talent?\u201cCalm down, sister.\u201d\u201cDo I really look like I can calm down?\u201d\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve decided to become a white Veratoux.\u201dHer goal is not to be a family head, but to live a long and happy life. For that, the white Veratoux would be perfect.\u2018There\u2019s nothing to do, sister.\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t understand your decision.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t understand me even three years ago.\u201dEven three years ago, Hera had criticized Viola. Why are you buying that useless land? What kind of wind was blowing?\u201cThree years later, what happened?\u201d\u201cI was lucky.\u201d\u201cSister is a businessman. Do you really think you\u2019re lucky?\u201dViola\u2019s eyes narrowed. Now, the murderous energy is somehow controllable.The first contribution that made the iron-blooded Princess. The murderous energy spread out to the surroundings.In fact, Viola was only able to reach this far, but anyway, the concentration of the murderous energy was deep.\u201cIf you really think that way, I might be disappointed with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHera bit her mouth for a moment.In fact, Hera knows. It wasn\u2019t just luck. It was a gambled investment made with thorough calculations.Viola smiled again.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand how upset sister is. You like me, and I like sister, too. I know how much you care for me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t need the clumsy sweet words.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it clumsily sweet?\u201dViola bowed her back slightly in front of Hera.She made eye contact with Hera, who sat in the wheelchair.She put her hand on Hera\u2019s hand.\u201cA person with great resourcefulness like my sister. I hate being ridiculed and subtly ignored for being a white Veratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHera met Viola\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want a good Veratoux, like sister, to ignore me because of the physical discomfort. In fact, there would be no black Veratoux without the white Veratoux. I can\u2019t stand the sight of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026So, you also applied for the white Veratoux?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily, but I won\u2019t say that there is no reason.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHera took a deep breath.\u201cIt\u2019s so absurd and ridiculous.\u201dOn top of Viola\u2019s hand placed on her right hand, she put her left hand.\u201cI don\u2019t feel bad.\u201dNo Veratoux had ever said this to Hera. Only Viola said this. Because of that, Hera was truly amazed.\u2018Veratoux knows how to wear a thousand masks.\u2019That was the evaluation Xenon made, and Hera also thinks so. That\u2019s because the way Viola treats other people is completely different.In fact, even now, three years later.She doesn\u2019t know the sincerity of Viola Veratoux.\u2018Whether it\u2019s sincerity or a mask.\u2019Hera made a very common-sense judgment. In fact, she decided that it was more likely to be a mask.\u201cI like what you say,\u201d said Hera.\u201cYour father must have thought of you as the black Veratoux.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dHera\u2019s eyes became serious as she caught her breath. \u201cYou know that I couldn\u2019t have allowed it without thinking, right?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dViola stood up.\u201cPerhaps you will give me a hellish test.\u201d<b>***</b>For the past three years, Tundra learned swordsmanship under Hickson.Hickson was a swordsman who wielded undefeated swordsmanship based on his mighty power.Tundra also learned heavy swordsmanship based on strong power under the influence of Hickson. He used a great sword that reached a whopping two meters in length, and was difficult to find an opponent among its peers.He always tried.In order not to become a shy dog \u200b\u200bnext to Viola Veratoux.He has already read the document more than thirty times. Tundra captured the great sword in the subspace and knocked.\u201cMaster, have you called?\u201dTundra strode forward to Viola.Then, he knelt down on one knee and bowed down.\u201cI\u2019ll be busy in the future. Did you hear that?\u201d\u201cI heard that you applied for White Veratoux.\u201dBlack Veratoux.White Veratoux.Anyway, it didn\u2019t matter.Whatever she chose, Viola was his benefactor, and she was the one to reach out in the most difficult times.\u201cWhat do you think will happen in the future?\u201d\u201cI think the Duke will test you.\u201dNot just a test, but a bullying-level task. In fact, the Duke wants a black Veratoux instead of a white Veratoux.\u2018Even if I die, I won\u2019t be a black Veratoux!\u2019She doesn\u2019t want to be the number one, and she doesn\u2019t want to become a real, ten-year-old princess. Viola thought this was the safest route.Tundra, who was on his knee, said,\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cCan I raise my head?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dViola did not make eye contact with Tundra for more than five seconds in three years because the Viola in her body could pop out again.She didn\u2019t want to lose her body.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stroke your hair instead.\u201dInstead of making eye contact with him, she stroked his hair. From Tundra\u2019s point of view, she was unintentionally playing hard to get.\u2014Stroke, stroke.Tundra shrugged his shoulders slightly. His face turned a little red.\u2018It\u2019s good.\u2019He liked this hand.He subjugated the bandits for this touch, to keep the master\u2019s hands from getting blood\u2026In Tundra\u2019s chest, a warm heart rose. Is this the way a puppy feels when he accepts his owner\u2019s touch?Another desire arose.\u2018I want to see her eyes\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t want much. He just wanted to see her eyes.Always, he spied on Viola\u2019s face only from a distance.\u2018She still doesn\u2019t allow it, but\u2026\u2019He hadn\u2019t seen her properly in three years. Tundra just stared at her from a distance. Unfortunately, the owner never gave a proper glance.That was a little sad.\u2018But, I won\u2019t be greedy.\u2019Someday.When the time comes, she\u2019ll look at him with those eyes.\u2018After enough communication, you can confidently ask for it.\u2019After he read the half-and-half document, he wasn\u2019t in a rush.1STKISSNOVEL. DO NOT STEAL MY TRANSLATION!If enough sympathy and trust are established, they will be able to behave like others.However, the time just hasn\u2019t come yet.Tundra left Viola\u2019s room.Suddenly he ran into someone in the hallway.\u2018Third Prince, Kundo?\u2019Tundra knew the face of a man.\u2018What is he doing here?\u2019His body smelled of blood.Kundo\u2019s eyes were somehow strange and ominous.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looked like a hyena looking for its prey.Thud. Thud.The distance between the two grew closer.\u201cOh, you\u2019re Viola\u2019s toy? No, the mongrel dog?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDogs usually bow deeply when they see their owners, don\u2019t they?\u201dTundra was not pushed by the momentum of the Third Prince, Kundo. His eyes were different from those of Viola\u2019s.\u201cMy master is Princess Viola. Prince.\u201dDoing the minimal greeting, Tundra raised his head and looked at the third Lord. The Third Prince was already known to have surpassed that of the Imperial Knights.\u201cSo, you can\u2019t bow down to me?\u201dPft.\u00a0He burst out laughing\u201cOwner and dog, they\u2019re funny ones.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cAm I obligated to report it to you?\u201d\u201cNo, but it\u2019s surprising. Isn\u2019t this the first time the Third Prince has visited this place? Besides, you smell like blood.\u201d\u201cTherefore?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s not polite to meet people with the smell of blood on them. Am I wrong?\u201dClearly, Kundo\u2019s body smelled of thick blood. He doesn\u2019t know for sure, but it seems like he came back after killing a lot of people or monsters. And, if he looked closely, he could see there was red blood on the end of his sleeve.Kundo smiled lightly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t get in the way, mongrel dog.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cKnow your place.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhere do you talk about human etiquette as a dog?\u201dKundo lightly touched Tundra\u2019s shoulder.It looked like he was dusting it off.\u201cA dog just barks when it sees its owner, wags its tail and barks.\u201dPower entered Tundra\u2019s eyes. Still, he couldn\u2019t make a fuss here.\u2018The master is over the room.\u2019He couldn\u2019t get a kick out of where the master was. Hounds only bite their prey when ordered.\u201cHey, Tundra.\u201d\u201cYes. Third Prince.\u201dKundo chuckled as he spoke the next word.\u201cBark.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTundra looked at Kundo silently.He wasn\u2019t really angry. Tundra\u2019s dream was to be a dog, and it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable to call himself a dog.\u201cDo it, you bastard.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTundra didn\u2019t say it, which was against Kundo\u2019s heart.Even his eyes that were still alive are annoying.\u201cWoof. Woof. Try barking.\u201d\u201cAgain, you are the Third Prince of Veratoux, but you are not my master.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Well learned. That\u2019s a good dog.\u201dKundo chuckled once more.Spit!He spat at Tundra\u2019s face. At that, he did not avoid it. Tundra just stood there like a wooden stone.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I coughed without realizing it. Now, wipe it with this.\u201dKundo held out his handkerchief.It was a handkerchief stained with bluish poison.Just then.Viola\u2019s room door was opened. \u201cThat\u2019s about it. Brother.\u201dThe Iron-Blood Princess Viola opened the door herself and came out.Viola, who was about to rest in her room, was slightly startled.It was the voice of the Third Prince, Kundo. It was as if he was arguing loudly, to make everyone listen.\u2018He has come.\u2019Third Prince, Kundo.She remembered various settings of Kundo. Nineteen years old. Kundo was a successor candidate with a great sense of inferiority to the First Princess, and he was learning swordsmanship similar to that of Tundra.He was a swordsman who mainly mastered \u2018Verratoux First Swordsmanship\u2019 in the novel setting.He also had so much power that he couldn\u2019t find an opponent at his age. Kundo was described as sultry and dangerous.\u2018The other thing is\u2026\u2019He was a man with hateful contempt for the white Veratoux. This was because he firmly believed that Veratoux\u2019s strength came only from strong force.Kundo turned his head to look at Viola.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it? Are you giving orders?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an order, it\u2019s a request.\u201d\u201cRequest?\u201dAt the polite words, Kundo\u2019s eyes drew a half-moon. He seemed to like the answer.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a request, should I do it more politely? What would you like me to do?\u201d\u201cI wish you would stop making the butler and maids flustered and carefully get out of my room.\u201dIn an instant, Kundo\u2019s body flinched.\u201cWell, the butler isn\u2019t here.\u201dKundo turned his head\u2014one hundred and eighty degrees turn in an abnormal way. He stared behind his back.And, at the end of the hallway, a maid was standing there.\u201cThe maid is over there. The maid was flustered to see you.\u201dHe smirked.\u201cI\u2019ll just get rid of the maid, right? Then, there\u2019s no one to see.\u201dMurderous energy gushed out of Kundo\u2019s body.Viola\u2019s gaze reached Tundra. Saliva was dripping down Tundra\u2019s cheeks.The moment she saw it, Viola almost lost her mind.\u2018This son of a\u2026\u2019He spat on that face. The Third Prince is garbage.\u201cCome here.\u201dViola beckoned to him.Tundra with all his senses turned towards her, ran towards Viola. As she made eye contact with Tundra. He flinched.He was spat on, he was insulted\u2026\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019That sort of thing didn\u2019t matter.Just making eye contact with her was nice. If he had a tail, it would have swayed softly.\u2018These are the eyes of the master.\u2019In the lavender eyes, Tundra\u2019s own face was reflected.Meanwhile, Viola felt dizzy.\u2018I\u2019m dizzy.\u2019Meanwhile, Kundo strode towards the maid. The maid seemed very frightened of him. Her legs were trembling, and cold sweat was dripping down.\u201cA,ah\u2026 Ah\u2026 sa, save\u2026!\u201dWithout realizing it, a groan leaked out. Her head turned white.White breath leaked from Viola\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re like garbage tainted with an inferiority complex.\u201dHearing that, Kundo\u2019s body twitched. He looked back.Viola\u2019s eyes were dyed red.\u2018Yes, this is it.\u2019This is it\u2026This was what Kundo had wanted from Viola. Meanwhile, the maid ran away, but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to see this.Not the white Veratoux.The appearance of a black Veratoux\u2026\u2018Beautiful.\u2019That murderous energy. A very special star recorded only in historical books. A human born with murderous energy.Kundo turned around, keeping his gaze on her.Viola\u2019s body was gone.Kundo hurriedly swung his sword.\u201cOh. That\u2019s fast.\u201dViola\u2019s dagger touched Kundo\u2019s greatsword. At that moment. her body moved as if it were gliding.Kundo read the movement.\u2018It\u2019s elegant.\u2019It was elegant and fast.\u2018Didn\u2019t they say she was ten years old?\u2019\u2026Ten years old.But, her movements were fast.\u2018Our great sister Medea wouldn\u2019t have been like this when she was ten years old.\u2019At that time. Kundo took a step back and swung his sword wide.\u201cVeratoux First Swordsmanship Chapter One. The Five-Pointed Stars.\u201dAs if a gray energy was leaking from Kundo\u2019s greatsword, and then a pentagon was created and then disappeared.Viola\u2019s body rolled away. She made flips in the air and landed in place.Blood flowed from Viola\u2019s mouth.\u201cA child who didn\u2019t learn Veratoux\u2019s swordsmanship at the age of ten achieved this much. Hoho, oh dear. I was defending myself. You did the attack, and you were injured because of it. You got it? I didn\u2019t use violence on purpose.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter because there are no witnesses.\u201dThere was a great physical shock.The shock made Viola come to her senses.\u2018Will the real Viola come out?\u2019After all, the purebloods of Verratoux were also beaten by monsters.The ten-year-old Viola could not defeat the nineteen-year-old Third Prince. He deliberately told her what technique he was using. He had enough room to tell her the swordsmanship formula while moving his body. Anyway, Kundo seemed to be feeling better.\u201cI prepared a present to commemorate meeting my little sister.\u201dHe opened the subspace, and he pulled out something.Drip, drip.Blood dripped.It was a cat bleeding profusely. It was barely holding its breath.Kundo slapped the cat recklessly,\u00a0tak!Throw.The cat touched Viola\u2019s paw. It was wriggling in pain. It looked up at Viola with pathetic eyes, barely breathing.Viola was heartbroken.\u2018It\u2019s too late to heal\u2026\u2019She lifted the dagger she was holding in her hand.\u2018\u2026Rest in peace.\u2019Third year after possession, this could be done without difficulty. The cat, who was having a hard time even breathing, was sent to a place where it no longer hurts.She shifted her gaze to Tundra.Tundra\u2019s chest was going up and down.He was breathing heavily and seemed to be controlling his anger.\u201cTundra. It\u2019s okay.\u201dThere was one way to stabilize Tundra.\u201cWait.\u201dTundra was like a dog. Like a puppy waiting for its prey in front of it, his body stiffened.\u2018Angry.\u2019He didn\u2019t do anything even though he was by her side. He was so upset that he felt like crying. Even though Viola knew Tundra\u2019s heart, she did not express it.She opened her mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame. brother.\u201d\u201cSo, why did the great talented youngest choose the white Veratoux? In fact, wasn\u2019t that Veratoux a coward?\u201dViola shook her head.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201dViola wiped her lips, where the blood flowed\u2014She wiped and walked slowly. Then, stood right in front of Kundo and whispered softly.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity for our first meeting. You piece of s***.\u201d1STKISSNOVEL. DO NOT STEAL MY TRANSLATION!At the same time, from the far end, someone appeared. They were emitting a strong vibe like a storm.\u201cYour greeting is very wrong.\u201dViola chuckled.\u201cDo you think so, brother?\u201dShe didn\u2019t survive three years for nothing.Now, the situation was reversed.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is known that he likes animals more than people.\u201cDo you want to die?\u201dAmong them, he especially loved dogs and cats, and he was called Cat Mom because he always gave food to stray cats roaming the streets.Kundo looked at Hickson with a slightly puzzled expression.\u201cSir Hickson?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dNo violence was allowed inside the Winter Castle. However, it was a different story when it comes to the training.\u201cWhy? Are you afraid?\u201d\u201cYou are insulting Veratoux.\u201dKundo nodded his head without much agitation.He knew Hickson was much stronger than him, but he couldn\u2019t refuse. If it was Veratoux, it should have been. Even if Hickson was stronger than himself, he couldn\u2019t avoid the oncoming fight.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the room.\u201dHe arrived at the training room. Of course, Kundo was beaten by Hickson in the training room.\u201cA weapon is a waste for someone like you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t use any weapon. He just hit with his bare fist.Kundo\u2019s cheekbones collapsed, and two of his fingers were fractured. He spread out on the floor and took a deep breath.On the other hand, Hickson seemed okay.\u201cThis guy. Pick him up and take it.\u201dKundo\u2019s butler frowned slightly.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take responsibility for this.\u201d\u201cHuh! What responsibility?\u201dHickson poked his nostrils with his index finger.\u201cWhat is the responsibility for being hit by me because he was weak?\u201d\u201c\u2026Prince Kundo is only nineteen years old now.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cThe potential for growth is endless.\u201dAs time goes by, Kundo will get stronger, while Hickson will be weak. He pointed that out.\u201cI wish a guy like that grew up.\u201d\u201cI hope you will not regret today.\u201dKundo\u2019s butler carried Kundo on his back. If he was treated by the priest, he would be healed without any aftereffects, but what about his broken self-esteem?Kundo\u2019s gaze turned to Viola.\u201cCoward.\u201dViola shrugged her shoulders. \u201cThanks for the compliments.\u201dWhite Veratoux uses resourcefulness.It\u2019s all right to draw power other than her own.\u201cIf possible, it would have been better if it was expressed as mercenary art.\u201dEventually, Kundo lost consciousness, and Hickson came closer.\u201cAre you okay, Viola?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI was shocked.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHickson raised his wrist. On his wrist was a magic-calling bracelet. It was a bracelet that formed a set with the bracelet on Viola\u2019s wrist. It looked like an ordinary silver bracelet, though it was an artifact with warning magic.An artifact that beeps from the bracelet on Hickson\u2019s arm when Viola injects magic.\u201cYou mean the call was too loud?\u201dThe strength of the call varies according to the concentration of the injected mana. Nonetheless, the call\u2019s strength exceeded its maximum volume and almost exploded.\u201cIt almost broke the bracelet.\u201d\u201cHmm. Is it because it\u2019s old?\u201dHickson smirked at Viola tilting her head.\u2018It\u2019s probably not because you don\u2019t really know.\u2019Actually, Viola really doesn\u2019t know. She knew that the purity and amount of magic she possessed far exceeded the universal level. So, the fact that she almost broke the bracelet, even though she didn\u2019t use much force.\u201cAnyway. You\u2019re okay right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Tundra. You come and bury this child well.\u201dViola handed over the dead cat to Tundra.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dTundra accepted the cat. However, he was a little strange.His eyes were red.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dTundra took her cat and trudged away. An empty lot far away from the training ground. There he dug with his hands.Tears dripped down the back of Tundra\u2019s hand.\u2018I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026\u2019If only he was really strong. If he had been strong enough that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to say something like that.\u2018The master would not have had to suffer such humiliation.\u2019Cats have a special meaning. For some people in \u3008 Shadow of Veratoux \u3009, the cat means a devil or a fallen person.Throwing a dying cat\u2026It was also an act of ridicule and denunciation of an unclean person. It made him so angry and upset.\u2018If only I had been really strong.\u2019Drop, drop.Just then, it started to rain.The rain in the winter castle was cold.Tundra, who had buried the cat well, was in the rain for a long time.\u201cI have to be strong.\u201dHe did not know exactly what the master meant. But, it was clear that the master had decided to become a white Veratoux. He himself had to be the one who supported her.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m of no use.\u2019Three years ago. Viola held out her hand.Having lost his father and sister, he offered to stay by her side.\u2018I have to be strong for the princess.\u2019However, suddenly he couldn\u2019t feel the rain. Still, the ground around him\u2014Drop, drop!It was still raining\u2026Though it didn\u2019t rain on him.With that thought, Tundra turned his head and looked up. He saw an umbrella. And, he saw Viola\u2019s face\u2026\u201cI knew you were going to be like this.\u201dShe seemed to know what Tundra was thinking and why he was down.Viola held out her hand.\u201cGet up.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an order.\u201dTundra hesitated for a while, then grabbed Viola\u2019s hand. Her hands were still small and warm.\u201cYou did your job well.\u201dSaying so, Viola stroked Tundra\u2019s hair.\u201cThe one I called was Hickson, not you.\u201dNo more rain fell on Tundra\u2019s face. But, something like thick raindrops dripped down his chin.\u201cI\u2019ll get stronger.\u201dTundra made a firm commitment. \u201cI will become strong enough that even trash like the third Lord won\u2019t dare look at me.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHis eyes turned red.\u201cSo, I will take away everything that insults the master. Surely.\u201dWater, whether it was tears or rain, was mixed and ran down Tundra\u2019s face.Hickson sat cross-legged and rolled his eyes towards Viola.\u201cMonster like bitch.\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying bitch to the Princess, no dignity.\u201d\u201cHow did you know that the third Lord would come?\u201d\u201cIs the third Confucius one who longs for me to become a Black Veratoux?\u201dSo, she prepared ahead of time.That\u2019s why she gave Hickson a magic bracelet.\u201cAnd, my father knows that, too, right?\u201d\u201cSo you and Heron both predicted the situation?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dViola drank banana milk instead of black tea. Maybe it was because she was ten years old, so she liked sweet milk more than tea.\u201cMy father would have wanted to see my response.\u201d\u201cA response as a white Veratoux?\u201d\u201cYes. I had to show mercenary skills, not force. So I called in uncle, and you got angry with the third Lord. There was a good cause, too.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason?\u201d\u201cHe pissed off the cat mom.\u201dViola shrugged her shoulders.\u201cWill your father not take any trouble at all?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dThat\u2019s right. Her father is also a hedgehog butler.\u201cMy father also likes animals.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? What?\u201d\u201cHe hates people who persecute animals.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard it before.\u201dOf course, that would be the case. It was because it only exists as a setting in the book.Hickson trembled once more.\u201cAnyway. You were expecting the third Confucius to come, and you set the stage.\u201d\u201cYes. Perhaps the report is already up right now?\u201dViola\u2019s prediction was correct.She expected the report itself to go up straight away. However, she did not know that he would be sharing this story with the First princess, Medea.The First Princess, Medea.The most likely successor candidate as the next duke, she opened her mouth.\u201cIt really happened just as father said.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs the Duke said, the Third Prince returned with blood.Viola did not use her own power, but an external figure named Hickson to bring down the third Prince. It was an action unsuitable for a black Veratoux, but it was an understandable action for a white Veratoux.\u201cI met Kundo.\u201d\u201cHow is he?\u201d\u201cHe is recovering through the priest\u2019s recovery prayer, but I think it will take a few days.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThere was silence for a moment.Heron and Medea were not friendly together.Medea opened her mouth again. \u201cBut there\u2019s something strange about it.\u201d\u201cStrange?\u201d\u201cSir Hickson said he only used his fists, but there was a scar on Kundo\u2019s chest.\u201dMedea didn\u2019t describe it as a wound to the extent of a slight scratch.\u201cProbably the inside of the skin was cut first, and the skin split open during the battle with Sir Hickson.\u201dIt is much more difficult to cut inside the skin than it is to cut the outside. It needs sharper energy, and must be able to handle magic to the utmost. It was a high-level sword that destroyed the body from the inside.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a sign of Sir Hickson.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI think it was probably Viola.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dA faint smile appeared on Heron\u2019s lips.Of course, Viola herself was completely unaware of it.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve often been told that I\u2019m the first on the continent, the first in history, the first in the world.\u201d\u201cYes, it was.\u201dHer combat prowess is comparable to that of the Duke of Heron as a child. Based on her overwhelming talent and steady hard work, Medea has risen to that level.She was also known by the nickname \u2018white wind\u2019.The wind refers to a cold wind blowing from the north.The white wind meant a huge snowstorm that blows once in ten thousand years, among other winds. According to the Imperial Records, it was recorded that as many as a hundred thousand people died when the white wind blew.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even do that when I was ten.\u201dHer smile deepened.1STKISSNOVEL. DO NOT STEAL MY TRANSLATION!\u201cIt\u2019s against someone stronger than her. Even Kundo has learned the Veratoux swordsmanship. I didn\u2019t know that she would inflict damage on Kundo. While proving her ability as a white Veratoux, she lacks the qualities of a black Veratoux. It must have been intentional to let you know that she wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAre you a little interested?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMedea asked.\u201cIs it okay if I meet the child?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And, the same year, she was sent to the Imperial Knights to subdue the goblin horde alone, and was recognized as a ninth-class regular knight.It was unusual.The Imperial Knights are divided by rank.After passing the ninth through first grades as an apprentice knight, you become a regular knight and start from ninth-grade again.People with outstanding qualities usually become ninth-grade knights around the age of twenty. Medea passed all the apprentice knight courses and immediately became a regular knight.Numerous newspapers at the time covered this fact.< The youngest ninth grade knight is born! >< Twelve-year-old Veratoux.

A great event struck the continent.< 122 assassins on the Western Continent Express killed. >One hundred and twenty-two highly trained assassins from the western continent were found slaughtered\u2026It was estimated that each one of them was equivalent to a second-grade knight.Among them, some were even skilled at the level of first-grade knights.It was said that the supervisor who was looking at the scene at the time was outraged. Coincidentally, the investigator was Hensor, who had gone out to support Medea a few years earlier.Hence, who was in fourth-grade at the time, was also promoted to first-grade knight in recognition of his genius.\u2018I was hit by one. And, I\u2019m helpless.\u2019One did not hide his skills.\u2018Veratoux\u2019s most destructive swordsmanship. There\u2019s a trace of the 3rd swordsmanship.\u2019\u2018There are only two people who can handle the three swords so freely.\u2019\u2018The lord of the winter castle. And his shining first daughter, Princess Medea.\u2019It turns out that Medea was the one who killed one hundred and twenty-two people.< The First Princess Veratoux. Granted the status of a first-grade knight! >< Medea. \u2018Received the thirty star. >She was awarded a star from \u2018Nelak,\u2019 who was praised as the Emperor of Swords.It was called a \u2018star,\u2019 and was a special title that only first-class knights could receive. There were only about five hundred first-class knights on the entire continent, and among them, only about thirty knights received a star.She was the first person on the continent to reach this level at the age of only twenty. People admired this wonderful record and praised Medea as a \u2018white wind.\u2019That was already three years ago.She is now twenty-three years old.First class knight.Among them, the first paladin Medea, who was given one star, knocked on the door.The kid that got the most attention lately\u2026To see Veratoux\u2019s youngest child.Viola couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Medea.Fluffy ebony hair.Red eyes like jewels.This was how it was expressed in the novel.\u201cA strange rumor has spread to the western continent.A beautiful witch with black hair and red eyes lives in the Central Continent.\u201cYou should never make eye contact with \u2018red eyes.\u2019 You will be terribly eaten.\u201dThe reason these rumors spread to the western continent was because of Medea.\u2018She calls herself such a terrible witch\u2026 Besides, she didn\u2019t leave out the modifier \u201cbeautiful\u201d.\u2019That\u2019s right.Looking at her red ruby-like eyes, she felt as if she was drowning in a deep lake. As soon as she saw the First Princess, whom she dared to call herself an absolute woman, what she felt was a kind of awe.\u2018Sister\u2026\u2019That sister\u2026She likes it.The next Duke candidate must be like that.Sister.\u2018I\u2019m never going to do anything bad, so please let me go, sister. Please.\u2019\u201cWould you like a cup of tea with me?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d say no.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI came here suddenly without a word.\u201d\u2018\u2026Oh. It\u2019s okay, you\u2019re the First Princess.\u2019It is all right for her sister.\u201cThat\u2019s just for visits I don\u2019t want.\u201d\u201cDid you want it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI really wanted to experience the white wind.\u201dMedea grinned. \u201cThe rumors must have been greatly exaggerated.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIt was never exaggerated.She is a genius who is born with the best talent and who fights for the best. She has always been and will always be.Medea said, \u201cThree years ago. I remember the welcome dinner.\u201d\u201cIt was fun.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMedea stared at Viola for a while.Just then, Xenon brought strawberry milk and black tea. Viola drank strawberry milk and Medea drank black tea.\u201cSister has a business, so that\u2019s why you came looking for me?\u201d\u201cYeah, I heard you hurt Kundo.\u201dFor a moment, Viola was taken aback.\u2018Eh? I hurt him? When\u2026?\u2019There seems to be some misunderstanding.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, but Sir Hickson. In the training ground.\u201d\u201cYeah. Sure.\u201dMediah\u2019s eyes narrowed.He had been badly wounded by Hickson. However, he clearly had injuries from Viola as well. She used a highly difficult technique to hit the inside of his body.\u2018Do you want to hide your power? in front of me?\u2019Hiding power is not bad.It is a kind of wisdom to hide your claws until you\u2019re strong enough.\u201cI understand your desire to hide your power.\u201dShe pulled a sword from her seat.Sureung\u2014A clear sword was heard.The tip of her sword touched her throat, though Viola didn\u2019t respond.\u2018I couldn\u2019t even see it.\u2019She didn\u2019t even move that fast. It just seemed to move slowly and naturally.When Viola came to her senses as she saw a blade in her throat. The blade was so sharp that she could feel the anticipation.\u2018Just touching it will cut off my throat.\u2019She imagined her neck being cut off.Medea\u2019s anticipation was so sharp.Xenon opened his mouth.\u201cFirst Princess, this place is inside the Duke\u2019s mansion.\u201d\u201cI know. But, I am a knight who has been given a star by Emperor Nelak. I don\u2019t think you know what that means.\u201dKing of swords.The star given by Nellak, called the swordsman for short, had a great meaning. The proof that she could rule over all laws other than the star of the Emperor.\u201cI became a one-star knight, and the emperor\u2019s laws are higher than the duke\u2019s laws. So it doesn\u2019t matter if I draw a sword from here.\u201dThen, Viola intervened.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs the Emperor\u2019s law higher than that of the Duke really?\u201dXenon\u2019s body trembled.\u201cPrincess?\u201dPrincess Viola\u2019s insight and agility are well known. However, now that statement was overly dangerous. Of course, the Emperor\u2019s not here, but it was still a very dangerous statement.\u201cViola. You\u2019re a smart kid. You know what I mean, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOf course. But, I don\u2019t think the winter lord\u2019s law is lower than the sword\u2019s law.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dMedea found Viola\u2019s words strange. On what grounds was this child saying something similar to that of treason? What logic would she use?\u201cIt\u2019s Dad.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI think my father is the strongest.\u201dIt was clearly stated in the novel.The winter Lord Heron and the swordsman Nellak had a close fight, but after fighting for seven days and nights, Heron eventually won.Though obviously, this was an informal duel.\u201cIt would be true that the laws of stronger people apply. At least here, in Veratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dMedea, who had gone through formal education and elite courses, was momentarily at a loss for words.There was no brilliant logic.This look was similar.\u2018My dad is the strongest!\u2019It was the appearance of a ten-year-old kid who claimed thatMedea had to clear her confused mind for a moment. She retrieved the sword from Viola\u2019s neck. Naturally, her movements were also completely unreadable to Viola\u2019s eyes.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes. I mean. Does older sister have the same power as father\u2019s special eyes?\u201dMedea is/was also the heir to Heron\u2019s \u2018true eyes.\u2019 She has eyes that can grasp the sincerity of a person.\u201cSo, you must know that I\u2019m serious.\u201dShe can\u2019t help but be serious. Because Viola already checked everything through the novel. It was certain and true that her favorite character, Heron, was stronger.Medea was a little embarrassed.\u2018Is this child, an iron-blooded princess?\u2019To be honest, she didn\u2019t look like an iron-blooded princess. She just looked like a child of her age.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s say so.\u201dShe had something to check.\u201cHiding your power is a good choice, but it shouldn\u2019t have been revealed.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd, if it was found out, you shouldn\u2019t have lied to me.\u201dActually, Medea was curious.She knew what kind of power is hidden in Viola.Although she had the optimal talent to become a black Veratoux, she chooses/chose the white Veratoux, and she wanted to know why she dared to injure Kundo\u2019s body with a high-level technique.\u2018You\u2019ll find out when you put your swords together.\u2019The mouth can lie, but the sword doesn\u2019t lie.Medea spoke again.\u201cWould you like to go to the training ground with me?\u201dViola was somewhat perplexed inside.In fact, she didn\u2019t even know that Kundo had been hurt. She wasn\u2019t hiding it on purpose, she really didn\u2019t know.\u2018Still\u2026 Medea is not a character who can make a nonsensical force.\u2019Viola nodded her head slowly.\u201cOkay. Can I drink all the strawberry milk instead?\u201dOnce she took the time, she decided to think of the way.If she is just a little bit wrong, everything may be exposed. Then, all plans would be ruined as well.She would become a cowardly loser who chooses the white Veratoux because she is/was afraid of the black Veratoux.\u2018I drink as slowly as possible to clear my mind\u2026.\u2019However, Medea, a genius, interpreted it very differently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I drink all the strawberry milk instead?\u201dWhat is the best way to do it?Medea interpreted this action, as she took her time to think differently.\u201cYou\u2019re relaxed.\u201dNone of her brothers act like Viola.Even the Second and Third prince, who showed open hostility, had never drunk strawberry milk in such a calm state. What\u2019s more, they\u2019re going to the training ground. Viola showed no sign of nervousness or fear.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. Xenon made it himself.\u201d\u201cThe butler?\u201d\u201cYes. he grinds and freezes strawberries himself.\u201dXenon chuckled.\u201cI also add in some ice cubes sometimes.\u201dThen, Xenon and Viola said at the same time.\u201cLike a snowflake.\u201d\u201cLike a snowflake.\u201dHe bowed his head.\u201cThe Princess likes strawberry milk so much. So, I practiced a bit.\u201d\u201cXenon. Aren\u2019t you a master of the ice sword? Are you making strawberry milk with that ability?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know where to put myself, but if the first-star knight said so. It\u2019s a pleasure to see it being used in this way.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strawberry milk made by micro-pulverizing with the ice sword method. It\u2019s interesting. Would you like to serve it to me next time?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dViola drank the strawberry milk as slowly as she could.Medea waited for Viola, drinking tea in the same shape as a lady.\u2018Even that look is pretty\u2026 \u2018Her favorite character was Heron, and her second favorite was Medea.Medea was always upright, and she never succumbed to any trials or threats. She was always like a calm lake where she kept peace.A huge lake that can devour everything by causing a flood at any time.As Viola drank her strawberry milk sparingly, she organized her information about Medea.[ \u201cMedea loved her family more than anyone. So, Medea wanted to have more power than anyone else.\u201d ]She was born with natural talent, and she was an effort-type genius who combined her desperate efforts in addition to that.[ \u201cUnder her powerful hegemony, she thought that it would be good if there were no more injured or dead siblings. She had to be strong.\u201d ]She didn\u2019t want to kill anyone. Ironically, it was so she had to be the strongest.And, at the end of the novel, she was also the character who was unlucky to be killed by the viola.[ \u201cViola. You\u2019ve grown taller.\u201d ][ \u201cSister. I longed for you and hated you at the same time.\u201d ]Even in the latter half of the novel, Princess Medea was a huge wall that was difficult to overcome.[ \u201cYou were always brilliant and stubborn. You were a different person from me. The most disgusting thing was that you loved me, your bloodless sibling.\u201d ][ \u201cThe problem is that I\u2019m going to attack you, sister, you already knew.\u201dViola\u2019s eyes turned red. Red tears flowed from her red eyes. ]In the original story, Viola was the one who opened her heart and gave affection.For her, Medea was a love-hated person.[ \u201cIf I were you, I would not have forgiven me.\u201d ][ \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have died in vain like this. You are Veratoux, whom I respected the most and will continue to respect in the future. But, why\u2026?\u201d ]It just rained that day. Today, it was a rainy day as well.[ \u201cThen why are you dying in vain?\u201d ]That day, Medea answered with a smile.[ \u201cBecause you\u2019ve grown up enough. I\u2019m already tired. So, I want to rest.\u201d ]Viola swung her weapon, a dagger. Medea\u2019s body tilted.[ \u201cI\u2019m sorry for carrying a heavy burden on you. Forgive my ugly sister.\u201d ]Even as she fell, Medea held her center.She sat cross-legged. With her blood flowing all the way, she said,[ \u201cNevertheless, I loved you. My family. My little sister.\u201d\u300dAfter saying those words, Medea closes her eyes.In that cross-legged posture.\u2026Medea, who was upright in her lifetime, was upright to the end.\u201cThe First Princess doesn\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201dThen, there was a way.Training ground.There, Tundra was learning the sword.\u201cOh, Medea. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d\u201cMiss. It\u2019s been a while.\u201dHickson shook his head as Xenon explained what was going on.\u201cNo matter how talented Viola is, is it reasonable for you to try it?\u201d\u201cThere is just something I want to check.\u201d\u201cWhat if I stop you?\u201d\u201cAnyone who blocks the will of Veratoux will have no choice but to be destroyed.\u201d\u201cYou? Me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything I can\u2019t do?\u201dHickson opened his eyes wide.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot, you used to be sloppy.\u201dIt seemed like a flash.But, what they feared did not happen.\u201cMiss got a lot smaller. At that time, you had very big hands.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I got smaller, it\u2019s that you grew up.\u201dHickson let out a sigh\u2014Hoo.\u201cLook at the red eyes in case someone isn\u2019t Veratoux. Then you\u2019re going to eat me?\u201d\u201cIf necessary.\u201dHickson sighed again. It was unlikely that he would stop.\u201cStill, there must be a mediator, right?\u201d\u201cIf you take care of it, I\u2019ll be relieved.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll cut anyone while they stop me.\u201d\u201cWho could it be me?\u201d\u201cWith a high probability?\u201dMedea grinned as she spoke her next words.\u201cYou seem to care about my sister a lot?\u201d\u201cHm. She is the daughter I have in my heart.\u201d\u201cDaughter?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that? That\u2019s exactly how I delivered it to Heron.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hearing this for the first time.\u201dMedea thought it was funny.\u2018His face is coming to life. It feels like a completely different person than before.\u2019At the time, Medea thought Hickson would die a few years later. It was sad to think that her friend, her father, would have killed his broken friend, Hickson.However, now six years later\u2026Overcoming the wounds of his past and standing up, Hickson became a stronger person than before.\u2018The cause is Viola. It was you.\u2019Her curiosity for Viola grew even greater.\u201cTake up your weapon. What weapon do you use?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m using a dagger.\u201d\u201cDid you know that it was a weapon that is inherently disadvantageous?\u201dMedea drew her sword.Sureung\u2014A clear sound resounded in the training ground.Even though it wasn\u2019t exposed to sunlight, the blade that flashed bright anticipation looked like a masterpiece created by a master with all his heart.\u201cIn order to use the dagger, it is the top priority to close the distance with the opponent.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess I said something too obvious.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSister.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cGive me a handicap.\u201dIf it had been another Veratoux, she wouldn\u2019t have said something like this. Nevertheless, the opponent was the First Princess, Medea.\u201cWhat handicap?\u201d\u201cSister, don\u2019t move on the spot. Then, I can definitely win.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dMedea chuckled. She didn\u2019t hate the way Viola brazenly asked for a handicap.\u2018Because I just need to check her skills.\u2019She said so.Was it a coincidence that she injured the body of Third Prince Kundo? Or, was it actually her skill?She decided to check it out.\u201cI\u2019m coming, sister.\u201dViola started trudging.\u201cFor you, footwork becomes more important than any other swordsmanship. The least you can do is read and listen to the timing faster than others\u2026\u201dMedea tilted her head for a moment.Viola strode towards her.\u2018It\u2019s not footwork.\u2019She just walked\u2026\u201cIf you come in like that, you\u2019ll get cut.\u201dMedea swung her sword.Hooo\u2014Her sword ran through Viola\u2019s hair. A few strands of her hair were cut off and fluttered in the air. Though Viola didn\u2019t even lift an eye.\u2018No reaction at all?\u2019It was like that in Medea\u2019s eyes.But, the truth was different.\u2018Wow, I\u2019m scared senseless!\u2019Inside, she felt scared to death. Although even after three years in the village school, I will make a dog recite a poem.*\u2018I\u2019ve been doing this for three years\u2026\u2019She got used to it a lot.She also practiced a lot against the blood-crazed killer witch. It was because she had to pass Xenon\u2019s test every day.\u2018Something like this is nothing.\u2019Medea was a prudent character. Besides, she wouldn\u2019t be used to this kind of situation.Even so, she wouldn\u2019t cut Viola.\u2018My sister never cuts her own blood.\u2019So, Viola in the original disliked Medea.She fights for herself to die, but Medea always just accepts it. That\u2019s what pissed off Viola in the original story.However, the now Viola was not the original Viola.\u2018I\u2019m not mad.\u2019Why would she be mad at her for not cutting Viola?It\u2019s never something to be angry about.\u2018Rather, thank you, thank you, oh, thank you!\u2019So, when Medea opened her mouth again and said.\u201cIf you approach blindly, you\u2019ll get cut.\u201dThe sword flew again with a threatening sword path.Viola did not dodge.She just strode towards her.A slight hair-thin difference passed Viola\u2019s neck. There was a minor cut on Viola\u2019s neck. It was dripping with blood.\u2018Ugh, ugh\u2014Aww!\u2019By now, she was sick of acting. She just stomped away.Swordsmanship genius Medea was only unfamiliar with this situation.This was the first.Viola just walked over and hugged Medea tightly around her waist.\u201cWin.\u201dCrash!With a sound, the dagger Viola was holding fell to the ground as she threw the dagger to the ground.\u201c\u2026.\u201dMedea didn\u2019t say anything for a moment.She had never experienced a hug with any of her siblings. Not a hug to analyze body shape, but a real hug.Something felt rather odd.\u201cViola. You\u2019re so defenseless. If I were your enemy, you would have died.\u201d\u201cThen, you can stab me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u201dViola released Medea\u2019s waist.She took one step back.\u201cIf that had been the case, there would have been no way that the Second Prince or Third Prince who openly exposed hostility to sister would have been alive.\u201dViola smiled and spoke to her.\u201cSister. If it\u2019s all right with you, can I talk with you? There\u2019s something I want to talk about.\u201dFirst Princess sister.\u2018I chose you as the next successor\u2026!\u2019Please be the next Duke.\u2018For my comfortable and splendid old age!\u2019She decided to draw the sketch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think you\u2019re a good adult.\u201d\u201cBut, why do you want me to go, too?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to talk.\u201d\u201cSo, why do you exclude me?

We should have a hot-bod conversation.\u201d\u201cUncle. Don\u2019t vent it on my dog.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not venting, it\u2019s training.\u201d\u201cThen, why are your eyes so bright?\u201d\u201c\u2026Was it noticeable? Hahaha!\u201dHowever, Tundra\u2019s answer was more speculative.\u201cPlease take care of me, Master.\u201dHickson was upset for Viola, and for Tundra it was a powerful shock therapy. He was constantly being stimulated.It was like that when he met Lord Kundo.It was still the same today.\u2018If I had been a really reliable dog, I would have been here, too\u2026\u2019He was thinking to himself.In other words, she doesn\u2019t want to tell anyone else. He, too, falls into that \u2018anyone else\u2019 category.\u2018It\u2019s probably because I didn\u2019t give enough trust.\u2019Viola said she would stay by his side. She reached out to him when he lost his father and sister\u2026\u2018One day, I will reach out to you. Becoming a reliable companion dog.\u2019\u2026So, he had to be strong.Deciding that, he spoke to the teacher with serious eyes.\u201cPlease be rough with me.\u201dViola was left alone with Medea.Meanwhile, Medea gazed at her. The pale purple hair and eyes. She was still small compared to her age.The girl in front of her looked slender and delicate.\u2018She probably didn\u2019t eat too much when she was young?\u2019She has been told that the aftermath still seems to be lingering.\u201cSister. Sister said I would have died if you had been my enemy.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know that?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I knew.\u201dIf Viola hadn\u2019t shown her appearance as a \u2018black Veratoux,\u2019 these words might have sounded absurd.However, she has already completed qualification verification.From the beginning of adoption until now. Not only did she show a more Veratoux-like appearance than anyone else, but she even established a record of subjugating bandits in recent years.Of course, it was actually done by Hickson and Tundra, although Medea didn\u2019t know that.\u201cBut why do you think I ran so recklessly?\u201d\u201cWell, why did you do that?\u201d\u201cBecause I trusted sister.\u201d\u201cDo you have any objective facts or evidence to believe me?\u201d\u201cI told you before. If sister had made up her mind, Second and Third Prince would no longer be in this world.\u201dIt was true. If Medea had a personality like Vixen, probably the Second and Third Prince would have already been found dead already.It would have solidified her position as the successor.\u201cSister.\u201dShe called Medea once more.Medea didn\u2019t like the name \u2018sister.\u2019 It was because Viola said it like it had a special feeling. Medea couldn\u2019t understand why she had such blind faith and favor toward her.\u201cIs this a political calculation?\u201dIron-Blooded Veratoux.Veratoux knows how to wear a thousand masks. So, is she approaching wearing a mask like this?\u201cI always wear a mask.\u201d\u201cI know. We all live in masks.\u201dViola looked into Medea\u2019s eyes for a moment.Medea\u2019s eyes are red. It was as if it had been crafted from a red jewel.\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dMedea lives wearing a mask. In the form of the First princess of Veratoux. She doesn\u2019t want to kill her blood and\u2026She loves Verratoux and her own family more than anyone.That\u2019s why she chose to be strong.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be honest, I\u2019ll be honest first.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cA war between blood and blood. Various plot tricks and dark battles to become an heir. I hate all of them. I\u2019ve always wanted a family. The family I dreamed and admired is not like this.\u201dMedea\u2019s expression hardened.A rich life flowed out of the ruby-red eyes.\u201cViola. It\u2019s not like Veratoux.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m not a Veratoux born because I was a very ordinary and abandoned child.\u201dTo be honest, Viola was taken aback.Medea was a first-class knight recognized even in the Empire. Among them, she is a one-star knight who was awarded a star.The murderous energy that a one-star knight exuded could not even be compared with the murderous energy that Vixen exuded. It seemed as if endless darkness fell upon Viola herself and the whole world around her.It felt like she was suffocating by sinking into a swamp made of darkness\u2026\u2018Let\u2019s get our minds right.\u2019She knows how much influence the author\u2019s settings have in this world. Therefore, she wasn\u2019t discouraged.\u201cI am an adopted daughter.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t take into account your complaints. You look like you\u2019re regretting being the adopted daughter.\u201d\u201cNo. Veratoux is a nice place. Much better than where I was. My mother died a long time ago, my father abandoned me. I had no brothers. Before coming to Veratoux, I was very, very lonely.\u201dAs she said her words, Viola was somewhat emotionally overwhelmed.Even though she tried to ignore and forget, the fragments of the unresolved emotions became sharp shards of glass, scratching Viola\u2019s heart.\u201cThe only person who gave me strength, though, died leaving me alone.\u201dKang Han-Joon, who grew up like her family, also died in a car accident. In fact, that was the most difficult time.\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cThat..\u201dAt that moment, she thought she had made a mistake. As she was speaking, Viola was so moved that too many words came out.\u201cThat was Uncle Hickson\u2019s daughter.\u201dMedea was convinced.\u201cYes. You said the reason you became friends with him had to do with his daughter.\u201dMedea looked at Viola with slightly softened eyes.She lived a very different life from the beginning than her who was born as the First Princess of the Duke family. She thought she was an iron-blooded princess, but she found out that she was not.\u2018A thousand masks\u2026\u2019Medea was confident in herself.No matter what others said, she did not waver in her values \u200b\u200band beliefs.\u201cSo, you mean the iron-blooded Veratoux is a mask?\u201d\u201cYes. Just like sister.\u201dMedea also wears a mask all the time.To become a perfect princess.She becomes a more perfect princess than anyone else, and she eventually swallows Veratoux\u2026 In order to destroy this law of the jungle environment.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty sure I\u2019m wearing a mask.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI felt it from the welcome dinner. Sister was looking at me with concern, not curiosity.\u201dMedea lost her words for a moment.Viola was right.She did not see Viola as an object of her curiosity.\u2018I heard he was seven years old, though she\u2019s very small.\u2019\u2018She must be a child who doesn\u2019t know anything. Is she okay?\u2019\u2018If she dies right in front of me, my heart will hurt.\u2019It was because Viola read all her inner thoughts in the novel.Then, she continued.\u201cIt was obvious because your eyes were so different from other people.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cIf that was the case, it would have been my mistake. Since I showed such a disheveled and weak appearance in front of sister, I will soon collapse. I will be disqualified as Veratoux.\u201dMedea did not answer. In fact, when she chose to meet Viola, she didn\u2019t think this would ever happen.Viola continued to speak her words as if she had to do everything she had to say.\u201cStill, sister. I\u2019ve admired sister since the old days.\u201d\u201cSince the old days?\u201d\u201cVerratoux\u2019s white wind blows even in the slums.\u201dIt was said that the nickname \u2018white wind\u2019 was so widely known.\u201cI misunderstood sister, so it\u2019s okay if I\u2019m making a mistake now.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cStill, I wish you were my sister.\u201dViola counted to herself.\u2018Three. Two. One.\u2019She was sure she would respond by this time.And, that conviction soon became a reality. Medea finally laughed.\u201cYou\u2019re bold.\u201d\u201cDid I make a mistake?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dMedea moved closer to Viola and gave her a gentle hug.\u201cCongratulations on becoming Veratoux.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dBecause of the hug, she suddenly felt Medea\u2019s body temperature.\u2018It\u2019s warm\u2026\u2019Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s a character she\u2019s liked from the moment she read the novel. Medea\u2019s arms were especially warm. She thought to herself that she had to make up all the words that Medea wanted to move her heart.\u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u201dIt\u2019s been three years since she became Viola Verratoux.She was three years older.The days she lived as Han Ah-Rin felt more like a dream by now.\u2018If it hadn\u2019t been for Brother Han-Joon\u2019s face, it would have felt more like a distant dream of the past.\u2019Because of Tundra\u2019s face that constantly recalls the memories of Han Ah Rin, her memories as Han Ah-Rin are only vivid. Now, she has become more familiar with Viola Veratoux.\u2018\u2026So, for me.\u2019She was like Han Ah-Rin in the old days.She is now Viola Viola Verratoux as well.\u2018I need a family.\u2019And, as the original owner of the body, the same was true for Viola Veratoux in the novel.[ \u201cHave I ever been in your family, even once?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up to be a great Verratoux. What do you mean family? It doesn\u2019t fit with you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d ]Viola asked.\u201cCan I hug you, too?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola lifted her heel.Medea\u2019s arms were warmer and wider than she thought. It felt like a baby kangaroo that slipped into the pocket of the mother kangaroo.\u201cThen, you\u2019re going to be my older sister now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been your older sister since you came to Winter Castle three years ago.\u201d\u201cNot a sister. Just a Verratoux.\u201dAlthough she pretended she didn\u2019t, Medea understood exactly what Viola was saying. Somehow, the child who was rumored to be that iron-blooded princess seemed rather cute.She is ten years younger than her.The little girl with light purple hair. Her sister\u2026\u201cPlease, be my older sister Medea.\u201dShe took out the Veratoux. Not an older sister as Veratoux, she was saying she wanted Medea to be a real older sister.Medea let out a sigh.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect something like this would happen\u2026\u201dIs this appearance and even the situation a forceful situation artificially created by this young princess\u2026?\u2018No.\u2019Medea believed her own eyes. This kid wasn\u2019t acting.\u2018Much more than where I was originally, my mother died a long time ago, and my father abandoned me. There were no brothers. Before coming to Veratoux, I was very, very lonely\u2026\u2019It could never have been acting.Even if she\u2019s acting, then she\u2019s really good at disguising herself.Either way, it didn\u2019t matter.\u2018Still, it would be nice if this was your true form.\u2019Asking to be her older sister, Medea suddenly thought that the figure of this child she held in her arms would be like a real Viola.But, then a voice came.\u201cWhat are you doing? I think I need some explanation.\u201dMedea\u2019s body trembled and trembled.She didn\u2019t seem to feel the presence at all, even the one-star knight Medea.\u201cFather.\u201dLord of Winter Castle.It was Heron Veratoux.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Played the Role of the Adopted Daughter Too WellChapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44A few minutes ago, Heron thought as he took his steps.\u2018Why am I going to Viola\u2019s room?\u2019He was looking at the flower crown that had been preserved with super-rapid freezing magic before. Then, he suddenly remembered Viola and came here.There was no particular reason.When he arrived in front of Viola\u2019s door, he could hear a voice.\u201cPlease, be older sister Medea.\u201dWhen he felt a presence outside the room, it seemed that Viola and Medea were hugging each other.He had extreme control over his mana, killing all sights and sounds.And so, Duke Heron slowly opened the door without making any noise.Just as expected.Viola and Medea were hugging. Looking at them, Viola was very short and lifted her heels tight.\u201cWhat are you doing? I think I need some explanation.\u201dHeron\u2019s reason thought.What a beautiful sight this is.Why are Veratoux\u2019s siblings so soft?Medea took a step away from Viola. Then, she bowed her waist slightly and placed her right hand on her left chest.\u201cGreetings, father.\u201dA greeting towards Heron, her father and Lord of the Winter Castle.Viola contemplated whether she should or not.\u2018Actually, father doesn\u2019t like that kind of polite manners.\u2019Everyone usually greeted the Winter Lord, although Heron didn\u2019t really like that greetings and courtesy.\u2018Should I still do it?\u2019Because there was such a thing as etiquette in this world.\u2018Well, I guess I missed the timing\u2026\u2019To be polite, she should have done it earlier. It would be more awkward to greet now and put her hand on her chest right now.\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know.\u2019With that thought, Viola just decided to take it easy. She lifted both of her skirts slightly and lowered her waist.\u201cWelcome.\u201dMedea\u2019s body flinched as she greeted.\u2018What do you mean, welcome?\u2019It was such an ordinary greeting. It was so ordinary that it became a problem because this was not an ordinary family, but the Veratoux family.Medea was worried inside.\u2018Viola. Don\u2019t relax.\u2019The other person was a thousand-kills Duke Heron before a father.It was the same for Medea.The Winter Lord Heron was closer than her father, Heron.\u201cBut, what explanation are you asking for?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you support White Veratoux?\u201dA white Veratoux must be smart.The white Veratoux are those who can penetrate and read the other person\u2019s innermost thoughts and devise strategies.So, now Heron\u2019s words mean, \u2018If you\u2019re a white Veratoux, interpret the situation yourself.\u2019\u201cI hugged Viola.\u201d\u201cI hugged sister Medea.\u201dHearing them, Heron\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly.\u201cYou both know I\u2019m not asking about the situation.\u201dMedea thought for a moment. The conversation they had earlier was not a conversation suitable for Veratoux. This was especially true for Viola.\u2018A war between blood and flesh. Various plot tricks and dark battles to become an heir. I hate all of them. I\u2019ve always wanted a family. The family I dreamed and admired is not like this.\u2019Whether or not her father had heard those words, Medea did not know.\u2018I have to protect Viola.\u2019Medea explained with a common-sense answer.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a basic virtue for Veratoux? Hugs the opponent, analyzes their body type, and feels the power and flow of the opponent\u2019s mana.\u201d\u201cThen, Viola?\u201dHeron was well aware of Medea\u2019s skills.She was a one-star knight in her early twenties. A swordsman who achieved growth comparable to that of Heron\u2019s youth. There was no reason for Medea to hug Viola like that, because there was no need for body shape analysis in the first place.Moments later, Viola replied.\u201cI told her to hug me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dMedea\u2019s stomach burned.In her judgment, Heron wasn\u2019t in a good mood right now.Veratouxs acted un-Verratoux like. However, she could not openly defend Viola since it was even less Veratoux-like.\u2018What the hell are you trying to say?\u2019Please, be older sister Medea.Viola said so.Thinking that, Medea made a decision. She decided to be the older sister of this child. She decided not to be sister Medea Veratoux, but to be sister Medea. She had to protect this child from her disappointed father.\u2018I do not know\u2026\u2019But, she doesn\u2019t know how to protect her.If it was a fight between a sword and a sword, she could fight somehow, but this case was different.Viola continued to speak.\u201cCan father hug me, too?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dViola moved on to him without waiting for Heron\u2019s reply.Her movements were reflected in Heron\u2019s eyes.Suddenly, the figure of Viola came to mind. She clung to Medea like a cicada, lifting her heels with her little stature.Now, she stood in front of Heron.Viola was still smaller than her age.\u201cThe reason is?\u201d\u201cHug me.\u201dMedea bit her lip.She looked so dangerous\u2026 wanting to him recklessly like that. Wasn\u2019t that kind of irrationality something her father hated?\u2018The reason is?\u2019If asked, the reason should be explained. And, when he asked like that, the answer Viola gave was too vague.Perhaps, their father was very offended.The child is now ten years old, and if she is not Veratoux, she will be removed immediately\u2026However, something amazing happened.Heron shoved his arm into Viola\u2019s armpit. At that action, she could feel her body float.\u2018Oh, I\u2019m flying?\u201dIt felt like she was flying in the sky for a moment.Her body went up.\u2018Looks like a feather.\u2019As Viola was held by Heron, she pressed her ear to his chest.Thud! Thud!His heart was beating.Heron\u2019s heart, known for having the coldest blood than anyone else, was the same as everyone else\u2019s. It ran normally and had an ordinary warm body temperature.Viola opened her mouth, burying her face in Heron\u2019s chest.\u201cI wanted to find out what the Winter Lord and the White Wind had in common. Because sister Medea inherited father\u2019s blood.\u201d\u201cWhat do we have in common?\u201d\u201cI do not know.\u201d\u201cYou do not know?\u201dHeron\u2019s eyes narrowed at her answer.If she couldn\u2019t figure out anything, all these actions became meaningless actions.That was to say, it was all a waste of time.\u201cI would have to grasp and for my hands to touch each other to understand.\u201dSaying so, she stretched out her arms, but Heron\u2019s chest was too wide.\u201cMy father\u2019s arms are too wide.\u201d\u201cIn the end, it means you didn\u2019t figure out anything.\u201d\u201cI realized that my father\u2019s arms were very wide and warmer than I thought.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cDoes it have to be meaningful?\u201dHeron lowered Viola to the ground.As her feet touched the ground, she continued. \u201cEvery time is worth only when they are meaningful. Veratoux should use all of their time wisely.\u201d\u201cJust.\u201dViola held her breath for a moment.With the heart of a reader who adored her favorite character, she built the world in the novel.\u201cI wanted to hug you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dMedea was confused.She didn\u2019t know what Viola was talking about, and it was strange that her father was more moderate than she thought.\u2018My father is different than usual\u2026\u2019What if Medea did the same thing?He must have been very disappointed. However, it was difficult for her to find any sign of disappointment in Heron.Something was out of the ordinary.\u201cI think it would be meaningful to find out why.\u201d\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola was confident.\u201cI think that the most necessary thing for White Veratoux is an insight into the essence of the world. That leads to intuition. I wanted to understand the essence of this unexplained heart. If my father hugged me, I wondered if I could find out the essence of that heart.\u201dShe then frowned slightly.Viola was like a child in her own agony.\u201cBut, I still don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no good reason.\u201dIn fact, this question was the question that Heron Veratoux posed in his mind.Heron Veratoux must feel the same now.\u201cWhy did I want to be hugged by my father? And, why did he hug me?\u201dIf there is no reasonable reason, why did he hug this child and not question it? This question made a big wave in Heron Veratoux\u2019s mind.And, on the big wave, she blew a bigger wind.\u201cJust\u2026 Can\u2019t you give me a lot of hugs? I\u2019ll find out the rationale and essence.\u201dAt that, she stretched her arms out.In the end, Heron hugged Viola again as if possessed by something.Viola whispered.\u201cThank you. For hugging me.\u201dHeron returned to the room.There\u2019s a lot of irrational things these days.\u2018Why did I go to Viola\u2019s room and hug her without saying a word?\u2019Viola\u2019s words pierced Heron\u2019s chest.[ \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know. There is no reasonable reason.\u201d ][ \u201cJust\u2026 Can\u2019t you give me a lot of hugs? I\u2019ll find out the rationale and essence.\u201d ]Knock, knock.Then, a knock resounded.It was Medea.Her eyes were like red marbles.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWill father punish the child?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Viola?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMedea bit her lip slightly.This behavior is not Veratoux-like because it\u2019s not right for a Veratoux to cover for another Veratoux.Though today, she wanted to do whatever moved her heart.Viola took off her mask and approached first. She first approached with a candid look and held out her hand. The little girl first gave her courage.\u2018This time, it\u2019s my turn to be brave.\u2019[ \u201cI got sister wrong, and sister got it wrong. So, it\u2019s okay if we\u2019re making a mistake now.\u201d ][ \u201cIt\u2019s okay if we\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d ]Even though Medea had lived her life acting perfect, she was well aware that she was not perfect herself.But, an unexpected answer came.\u201cWell. If I was going to punish her, I\u2019d have done it on the spot. Why did you think I would punish Viola?\u201d\u201c\u2026I thought father was different than usual.\u201dDifferent from usual.He was much more gentle than usual. It meant that soon, both his interest and expectations for Viola would have been abandoned.Medea Veratoux interpreted it that way.Heron thought for a moment.\u2018Different from usual.\u2019He also clearly recognized it. It was very different from usual. When dealing with Viola, he looks very different from usual.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I want to do this mission with Viola.\u201d\u201cYour mission is to kill Jackal, the Head of Storm Fortress.\u201d\u201cI know. I know it\u2019s an overly risky mission for that kid now.\u201dMedea thought.\u2018If this mission is successfully accomplished, Viola will be able to prove her ability once again.\u2019What she had shown so far wasn\u2019t too bad, though killing the Head of the Storm Fortress was a completely different matter. If the appearances she had shown so far have been great for her age, this mission was a great mission regardless of your age.If it could be done, Viola\u2019s position and status would rise rapidly.\u2018If I help, Viola will be able to prove her strength as a Veratoux once again.\u2019Medea sincerely vowed to help Viola.[ \u201cI wish you were my sister.\u201d ]She decided to become an older sister.The next day, Medea visited Viola\u2019s room.She was drinking her strawberry ade at the same time.She was handed the strawberry ade from Viola. It has been a long time since she had such a sweet drink.The cool refreshing sensation permeated her body.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dIn Medea\u2019s eyes, she was an innocent ten-year-old kid.\u201cViola. The mission order will be issued soon.\u201d\u201cA mission order?\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019ll be on a mission with me.\u201dViola was nervous for a moment.The mission that Medea received was a heinous mission whose difficulty was beyond imagination.\u2018Why, why do you want me to come?\u2019Medea said sincerely.\u201cI\u2019ll be your sister. I\u2019ll help you further, so that you can prove your Veratoux figure.\u201dNo\u2026\u2018Sister. There seems to be something wrong with the focus.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m going to Storm Fortress.\u201dAt that word, she seemed to know what the mission was.The mission is to kill Jackal, the leader of the Storm Fortress. It was also a mission that almost killed even that great Medea.\u201cIs your mission to kill the storm sword Jackal?\u201dShe prayed it wasn\u2019t. Viola hoped that was not the mission.\u2018It\u2019s too dangerous\u2026\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re like a white Veratoux. That\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThere was an overly beautiful smile.It was so refreshing that she wanted to die.In the fourth year of possessing, Viola was out of breath for the first time in a while!\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Played the Role of the Adopted Daughter Too WellChapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45\u201cIs your mission to kill the storm sword, Sir Jackal?\u201dThis mission, summarized by the mission name \u2018Eye of the Storm,\u2019 was one of Han Ah-Rin\u2019s top five worst choices. Viola was also aware of the latest news trends.Jackal has published a column in the newsletter several times.[ The preferential treatment for the winter castle must be eradicated. ][ I respect the warriors of the Winter Castle, but this policy is wrong. ][ Duke Veratoux is going down the wrong path to satisfy his self-interest. ]The reason is that the \u2018Golden Road,\u2019 a trade road connecting the winter castle from the central continent\u2019s monarch, was announced on a large scale. In the process, the Youngest Princess of Veratoux earned whopping billions of dahlias.Therefore, Jackal\u2019s argument was clearly plausible.[ At the time, Veratoux\u2019s youngest princess was only seven years old. ][ The people speculated with two hundred million dahlias, are hard to even touch in their lifetime. ][ This is an illegal transaction using a borrowed name. ]The contents of the newsletter have left many people feeling deprived and lost.In addition, public opinion was formed that Duke Veratoux was greedy for self-interest and acquired his fortune in an illegal and wrong way.Viola sighed.\u2018It\u2019s different from the original, but it\u2019s similar.\u2019In the original, Jackal argues for other reasons. It must also be three more years from now.\u2018It\u2019s faster than the original, and the content has changed. But it\u2019s the same with biting the Duke.\u2019Although the details have changed, the big flow has not changed. The author\u2019s setting does not seem to have changed in any way.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you know about the recent continental trend?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSo, I was ordered to kill Jackal.\u201d\u201cThen, father will be pointed out as the culprit?\u201d\u201cDoes that matter?\u201dMedea tilted her head.For a moment, Viola quickly nodded her head.\u201cOf course, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dWhatever.As long as they don\u2019t have physical evidence\u2026 It was clear that Medea was thinking.\u2018Although older sister is benevolent and warm-hearted\u2026 I forgot she was Verratoux.\u2019One thing is important here.There should be no evidence \u2018for sure.\u2019At that moment, Viola recalled the essence and attributes of this world that had been forgotten for a while.\u2018Okay. Let\u2019s not forget this is the world of \u3008 Shadow of Veratoux \u3009\u2019Viola lay on her bed alone, organizing her thoughts.\u2018I didn\u2019t know this case is going to come so soon.\u2019She thought about Jackal.In the novel, Jackal was represented as the proud head of the Storm Fortress. If the winter castle is the northern shield that protects mankind from \u2018where it snows,\u2019 the Storm Fortress was a defensive fortress that protects the Empire from \u2018the canyon of barbarism.\u2019\u201cHe was famous for having a strong-willed personality that could not be broken.\u201dOn one occasion, a high-ranking official of the Empire came and bribed for his son to join the Storm Fortress.[\u201d I do not accept illegal solicitations and bribes.\u201d ][\u201d Are you ignoring my sincerity?\u201d ][\u201d I\u2019m not ignoring it, I\u2019m just following the rules and principles. If you repeat the same thing one more time, I\u2019ll count it as trampling on the pride of the Storm Fortress and me.\u201d ][\u201d Are, are you threatening me?\u201d ][\u201d It\u2019s a warning, not a threat. Go back.\u201d ]There was a narrative that If it were not for Selina, instead of the Empire, Jackal would be at a great disadvantage.In any case, Jackal was expressed as a person who never tolerates injustice, has extreme contempt for violations of principles, and always disciplines and devotes himself.\u2018Only once. The time to give up his life beliefs is probably now.\u201dIf the main flow of the novel is the same, now Jackal is not writing a column of his own will.External forces intervened.No one knows at this point. However, Han Ah-Rin, who was a reader, knows it well.The next morning, the sun was bright. The sky was very high today, and the sunlight was golden with abundance.Viola visited the annex.\u201cUncle.\u201d\u201cYes, why?\u201dHickson was meditating.Without opening his eyes, he continued to concentrate on the meditation.\u201cAre you friendly with Sir Jackal?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHickson slowly opened his eyes and asked.\u201cWhy? Killing Jackal?\u201d\u201cWill you give me such a task?\u201dAnyway, this was a top-secret mission. At least, the fact that there was a \u2018mission to kill Jackal\u2019 had to be hidden unconditionally.Even if the other person was Hickson.\u201cThe opponent is Sir Jackal. Storm Swordsman. How can a child like me kill Sir Jackal?\u201dHe gazed at Viola as he crossed his legs. Hickson, who had become a completely different person from three years ago, looked at the girl in front of him for a long time.\u201cI think you have something to say.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been studying hard about Sir Jackal.\u201d\u201cHowever?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the one to frame or persecute Winter Castle by writing a column in the newsletter. He\u2019s not very interested in continental affairs or politics.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is. He has a very eccentric personality.\u201dViola opened the newsletter she was holding in her right hand. There was also a photo of Jackal, along with a column he contributed.\u201cJust, when I saw this picture, I thought of uncle.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m much more handsome?\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cI heard that a warrior should know himself. I think you are not. Your objectivity is too low.\u201d\u201cAre you really going to say that?\u201dHickson made an exaggerated gesture and covered his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sad.\u201dEven though it seemed like he was joking, Hickson was actually sad. Normally, he wasn\u2019t hurt by anything anyone said, but Viola was different. For him, she was the daughter in his heart.It felt like an ugly father being pointed out by his daughter.\u201cAnyway, if I were Sir Jackal, I don\u2019t think I would have written a column like this.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cI think I would have formally protested by leading a storm squad to Winter Castle. And, I must have tried to figure out the truth by confronting me, the Princess.\u201dHickson thought of Jackal.\u2018Well. Definitely him\u2026\u2019This method was not Jackal.It was Jackal\u2019s method to directly question the party at fault.\u201cThis is not a protest against the hops, it\u2019s like agitating public opinion.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cAnd, I think Sir Jackal knows father very well.\u201d\u201cYes. Because they were colleagues who once had each other\u2019s backs and fought together many times. Although they didn\u2019t like each other.\u201d\u201cDoes Sir Jackal think father was trying to get an illegal advantage because of only two billion dahlias?\u201d\u201cOnly two billion.\u201dHickson chuckled and laughed.Most ordinary people couldn\u2019t even touch one hundred million dahlias. So, two billion dahlias was definitely a lot of money.However, Viola\u2019s words were not wrong either.\u2018It\u2019s Veratoux.\u2019She was a Veratoux, the daughter of the most powerful Duke in the Empire.Veratoux trembling at two hundred billion dahlias was strange. Rather, expressing \u2018only two hundred billion\u2019 was much more Verratoux.\u201cDo you think Sir Jackal would have thought so?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201dViola touched the photo in the newsletter with her index finger.\u201cLooking at this picture, I said that it reminded me of uncle, right?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Sir Jackal also has a young son?\u201dAt that, Hickson\u2019s expression immediately hardened.Medea did no tricks.She even sent an official letter saying that she would visit Storm Fortress.The official message transmitted by magic was approved within one day, and a visiting group was organized, led by the First Princess, Medea.Viola stared in the mirror and fell into thoughts.\u2018Veratoux that officially visits and kills\u2026\u2019Princess Medea was coming. Even the storm sword Jackal couldn\u2019t be ignorant of Veratoux\u2019s intentions.\u2018Jackal who welcomes it even though he knows it all.\u2019A sword that would stab him, and a shield to block it outright. It will be a battle between the two. It was like that in the original.\u2018I have to stop it.\u2019As a result of this incident, Jackal became affiliated with the Falail family.The Falail family was a family that later grew rapidly. Led by one of the major supporting characters, Jeremy, who was also known as the Little Storm, the Falail family grew to a great extent and became a great enemy of the Duchy of Verratoux.\u2018The female protagonist, Viola, also nearly died several times.\u2019Even the First Princess, Medea, almost died as well.Either way, he was a very dangerous enemy.It had to be stopped\u2026\u2018I can\u2019t let it ruin my rosy future!\u2019Knock, knock.With a knock, Xenon entered the room. Viola could see his figure in the mirror.Xenon chuckled.\u201cIt is my responsibility to train the Princess.\u201d\u201cI know. But, Xenon has restrictions on his actions. He\u2019s wanted by the Empire.\u201dViola, along with the butler Xenon, named Tundra as the official attendant.Xenon didn\u2019t seem to like it.Viola turned her body to meet his eyes. Although Xenon was still smiling, he looked somehow uncomfortable.\u201cStorm Fortress is different from Winter Castle. Much closer to the heart of the Empire.\u201dIt was Xenon who killed more than twenty second-class knights of the Empire. Hence, he was also a body wanted by the Empire. So, for this accompaniment, we needed the help of the masked and disguised Seiban.\u201cEven with the help of Lord Sevban, it\u2019s not perfect.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me what kind of trouble you cause.\u201dShe spit out sounds that he didn\u2019t want to hear.He got used to it a lot in three years.\u201cIf you do something wrong and tarnish my face. If there are restrictions on actions, I will ask for that sin and behead you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of being decapitated, Princess.\u201d\u2018Ah. Of course, you don\u2019t.\u2019It was Xenon, who once said, \u2018Would you like me to cut off my head?\u2019 She remembered being horrified because it was sincere.\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes?\u201dXenon\u2019s eyes trembled very slightly.A Veratoux more Veratoux than anyone else. The light purple eyes of the iron-blooded princess were captured in Xenon\u2019s eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my capable butler, so follow my orders.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHearing that, Xenon stood silently for a long time, then placed his right hand on his left chest.He nodded and answered.\u201cI will obey the Princess\u2019s orders.\u201dThe next day, three carriages departed from Winter Castle.The destination was south of Winter Castle. It was the storm fortress located between the canyon of barbarism.Even after moving through the mobile gate, they still had to travel for a long time.In the carriage, Viola stared out the window.\u201cThis continent is wide.\u201dIn fact, she had no idea how wide it was. She just felt vaguely that it was very spacious.And, a week later.Veratoux\u2019s delegation, led by Medea, arrived at the Storm Fortress.The road was narrow and rough, barely able for a carriage to pass\u2014a huge fortress located between the canyon of barbarism. A golden lion\u2019s flag fluttered in front of it, symbolizing the Duke of Veratoux.Boo, woo\u2014!The sound of the horn was heard, and the massive iron gate began to slide open.\u201cWelcome. First Princess Medea, and the Sixth Princess Viola.\u201dFrom the iron gate, someone in heavy armor walked out alone.Head of Storm Fortress, the storm sword Jackal\u2026A long sword was held in Jackal\u2019s hand, and a blue light stood out. That momentum was sharp.Medea smiled and took out a huge sword from the subspace.\u201cLong time no see, Sir Jackal.\u201dThe momentum of the two collided in the air, and a vortex began to form around them.Viola swallowed inwardly.\u2018What kind of rapid development is this!\u2019It looked as if they were going for the sword at first.\u2018My body is going to shatter just by rubbing against the momentum.\u2019Now, the absolutes of this world met.Even the slightest mistake can lead to death.\u2018I, myself, I have to do well.\u2019She has been good for the past three years.Viola decided to do better today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Played the Role of the Adopted Daughter Too WellChapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46Jackal was given the nickname \u2018Storm Sword\u2019 because his momentum and sword were as strong and sharp as a storm.Looking at him, Viola was able to clearly understand what the \u2018stormy momentum\u2019 that was mentioned in the novel was like.The magic storm created by Medea and Jackal was bloody.\u201cFor a reaper who came to kill me, you have the most gentle expression on your face.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on a goodwill mission. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, dear Sir Jackal.\u201dMedea, who drew her sword, bowed her back politely.Both know each other\u2019s goals and intentions. They knew each other thoroughly, but silently pretended not to know each other.\u201cAs the head of the Storm Fortress, I welcome the Princesses of Velatu. As a welcome greeting, I would like to share the exchange of swords with Princess Medea.\u201d\u201cAs much as you want.\u201dViola swallowed her saliva.\u2018If I step in for no reason, my arms and legs won\u2019t get cut off, right?\u2019It actually seemed like it.It felt like a monstrous creature was staring at her.\u2018I still have to be brave.\u2019Even though she was scared to death, Viola didn\u2019t show it on the outside. This was what she had been learning for three years.Not telling the truth.\u2018If I go between the momentum of those two\u2026 I\u2019m really going to die.\u2019No matter how young Viola was, she was still a ten-year-old child. It was absurd to say to enter between the momentum of the two characters, which are described as almost completely self-sufficient in the work.\u2018Still, believe me, the author\u2019s settings!\u2019Viola moved her steps.Because she was so scared, cold sweat ran down her.\u2018Oh, I\u2014I, I don\u2019t know.\u2019Not knowing what to do anymore, she just closed her eyes and started walking.She couldn\u2019t see anything with her eyes closed, anyway. Besides, Viola was more comfortable walking with her eyes closed.Hickson, who was watching the situation from behind, frowned slightly.\u2018Viola?\u2019Should he catch Viola?It was dangerous.But, he couldn\u2019t go out since before Viola departed, she had been asking him.[ \u201cUncle. If I don\u2019t ask for help, just wait patiently for me.\u201d ][ \u201cUncle. Do you believe me?\u201d ][ \u201cInstead, if I ask for help, protect me. Got it?\u201d ]Because of that, He decided to watch a little more, as Viola said.Until she asked for help.Medea, who drew her sword and joined the welcome ceremony of the Storm Fortress, also felt Viola\u2019s movement.\u2018Viola! What are you doing!\u2019They are now fighting for momentum.The intangible magic emitted by both sides is fighting for each other\u2019s space and territory. It was invisible, though the space between Medea and Jackal was like the strait of death.The youngest child was walking towards it.\u2018There\u2019s no way she can\u2019t feel this momentum\u2026!\u2019She didn\u2019t know what Viola was doing.It was incredibly reckless. It wasn\u2019t a sword pressure a ten-year-old could withstand. However, she couldn\u2019t pick up this momentum now.The moment the momentum leans to one side, victory or defeat will be decided. In an instant, Jackal\u2019s sword would touch her neck.As the First Princess of Veratoux, she could not tolerate such a defeat.\u2018However\u2026\u2019If she doesn\u2019t pick up the momentum, Viola will get hurt.Minor scars began to appear on Viola\u2019s flesh.\u2018Uh, uh\u2014Ah, ah! It stings!\u2019It was as if poison had reached her skin like the welcome dinner. It felt like dozens of sharp razor blades were rubbing against her soft skin.Medea was conflicted.\u2018You have to gain momentum.\u2019Storm sword won\u2019t be the first to gain momentum.The one who was most disappointed was herself. Her heart ached as she saw the red scars engraved on Viola\u2019s soft skin.\u2018No.\u2019But Viola was now going on her path. She did not know what Viola was thinking and what she was dreaming of.Nevertheless, Viola is Veratoux.Veratoux decided their own path and walked it.\u2018Rather, I should respect Viola Veratoux.\u2019Then, Jackal took the first step.Jackal was defeated in the battle of magic, which was a tight competition between them.\u201cKeuhk.\u201dA reverse storm blew and struck Jackal\u2019s chest.There was a gap.As usual, she had to rush in and set the fight at this time. Although Medea did not wield her sword.\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t you wield the sword?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Storm Sword be considerate first? Thank you for taking care of my sister first. It\u2019s actually my defeat.\u201dViola swallowed a gulp three times.\u2018Wow\u2026 I really thought I was going to die.\u201dIt felt like she was walking through a bunch of wildcats dancing sword dance. If she did something wrong, her throat would be cut off! That vivid feeling was as if she was about to be cut off.It seemed like a fantasy.Hiding her trembling heart, Viola bowed her back.\u201cThank you for the momentum, Sir Jackal.\u201dJackal lifted his head once as if nothing had happened, then gazed at Viola and said, \u201cYou did something reckless, Princess Viola.\u201d\u201cYou took a good care at that reckless thing.\u201d\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gained momentum, the Princess would have been seriously injured.\u201dViola stood up on her back. She stood in an upright position and looked at Jackal.\u201cI believed that Sir Jackal was someone\u2019s father.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dFor a moment, Jackal\u2019s body froze.\u201cI know Sir Jackal has a son my age.\u201dJackal was represented as a knight who loved children, even though his cold reason can\u2019t use his strength in front of children.\u201cSo, I thought you wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s reckless.\u201dJackal grabbed his sword.It was not a good atmosphere to mix with Medea and the sword.Viola did that.\u201cI\u2019ll greet you formally. I\u2019m White Veratoux, Viola.\u201dViola and the party were guided to the annex of the Storm Fortress.It wasn\u2019t as big and pleasant as the annex of the winter castle, but it was good enough to stay for a while.Medea spoke up first.\u201cSir Jackal is right. Reckless.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t reckless. As a white Veratoux, I acted with everything in mind.\u201d\u201cWhat did you consider?\u201dViola felt it. This question was soon a test for the youngest child.\u2018I have to answer well.\u2019If she didn\u2019t do it right, Medea would surely be greatly disappointed.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m sure Sir Jackal won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cSecond, I\u2019m sure my sister won\u2019t hurt me, even if Sir Jackal doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause both people who could hurt me were trying to protect me.\u201cWhy were you so sure?\u201d\u201cAt least, more than a welcome win or loss, I thought that sister would love me more.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause if I were sister, I would.\u201dSaying that, Viola stared at Medea with unshakable eyes. Medea\u2019s \u2018truth eyes\u2019 and her purple eyes collided.Rather, Medea\u2019s eyes fluttered.\u2018This child\u2026 She\u2019s serious.\u2019She would have been if she had been her sister.Those words were sincere.And, the words were strangely inspiring\u2026\u201cSo, you mean\u2026 your actions weren\u2019t reckless, but a strategic approach as a white Veratoux?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your ultimate goal?\u201d\u201cTo solve the case without killing Sir Jackal.\u201dMedea tilted her head.\u201cIt\u2019s my job to kill Sir Jackal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been given an extra mission.\u201dBefore coming here, it was signed by Heron Veratoux himself. In any case, if Jackal made a statement in support of Winter Castle and Veratoux, along with a public apology, that they would not have to kill Jackal.\u201cIsn\u2019t this more efficient and reasonable than killing Sir Jackal?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a great knight and warrior who keeps the canyon of barbarians safe. Without Sir Jackal, the Monarch will definitely ask for Winter Castle\u2019s cooperation. Using the trade road revitalization as an excuse. Besides, on the condition that we are excluded from the list of suspects who murdered Sir Jackal, then the power of Winter Castle will most likely be weakened.\u201dViola took Medea\u2019s hand.\u201cSister. I have no intention of interfering with sister\u2019s mission.\u201dThis, too, was sincere.If she interrupted Medea, her neck may be cut off.Viola wanted to live long.\u201cBut, you can\u2019t do an assassination right away.\u201dShe would get good timing, and that good timing may not come any time soon.Jackal must also have an assassination in mind.\u201cI\u2019ll meet Sir Jackal first.\u201dTundra\u2019s eyes sank seriously.\u201cI will serve the master. I am a dog that watches over her.\u201d\u201cI will serve the princess. I am the Princess\u2019s direct butler.\u201dXenon chuckled.As Tundra and Xenon glared at each other, the hostility towards each other was burning brightly.Viola let out a sigh.\u201cThe blanket, I just need to cover it.\u201dWhat is this?\u2018Why are the two of them fighting here?Even for ten minutes\u2026Xenon smiled and said.\u201cThe Princess has a habit of always kicking the blanket around 3:23 in the morning. I have always served her, and I am doing my best to prevent her stomach ache.\u201dHe bowed his back politely.\u201cSo, I hope you can grant me the honor of taking care of the Princess.\u201dTundra radiated open hostility.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give up your privileges?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be strange to put down the privilege?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think it is the duty of the privileged class to put aside the privileges they normally enjoy?\u201d\u201cI do not agree to such an obligation, Tundra.\u201dViola yelled at them.\u201cBoth of you, get out!\u201dIn the end, Xenon and Tundra are kicked out of Viola\u2019s room.The next day, the morning was bright.At dawn.Viola and Hickson headed to the training hall of Storm Fortress.Hap! Hap!A shout was heard from afar.The Knights of the Storm Fortress seemed to be training.Viola sat on a bench on the other side of the training hall and waited until their training is over. Jackal, who was leading the training, finally put down his sword and wiped his sweat with a towel.He came closer to Viola.\u201cPrincess Viola is waking up early.\u201d\u201cThe majesty of the Storm squad is so great, I wanted to see it at least once.\u201dAfter greeting Viola, Jackal held out his right hand.\u201cYesterday, I wasn\u2019t in a good mood, so I couldn\u2019t greet properly, Sir Hickson.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re so happy with each other.\u201dHickson replied bluntly as he took Jackal\u2019s hand. The greetings were rough, however, there was a little bit of affection towards each other.\u201cAre you still practicing from four in the morning?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHickson shook his head.\u201cI hate people who live upright like you. How can humans be like that? Machines?\u201d\u201cI heard that you\u2019re in trouble, are you okay?\u201d\u201cUh, thanks to that person.\u201dAt his answer, Jackal\u2019s gaze fell on Viola.Why did Viola come here?Why did she jump into that dangerous place yesterday? And, what do you mean by thanks to that person, Viola?\u201cThe real reason is not that I want to visit the storm squad. Why did you come to me? Besides, what does Sir Hickson mean?\u201dViola jumped off the bench.Seeing so, Jackal knelt down on one of his knees and set his eyes on her.\u201cSir Jackal, do you know the story behind Uncle Hickson?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know. I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201dShe decided to go straight to the point.\u201cIsn\u2019t Sir Jackal sad?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dShe spoke without hesitation about what was considered a \u2018top secret\u2019 in the novel.\u201cYour son is gone.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\u201cSomehow, it\u2019s very similar to Uncle Hickson\u2019s situation. Things like that happen often on the continent.\u201dCasting characters with power.Kidnapping of a loved one.No evidence left.\u201cI want to help Sir Jackal, as a white Veratoux.\u201dThen, she added one more thing.\u201c\u2026Because there shouldn\u2019t be more sad people like my uncle.\u201dHickson\u2019s heart wept at the words \u2018my uncle.\u2019\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To exaggerate a little, it seemed that a white runny thing was spewing out.\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cShe said, my uncle.\u201d\u201cIs that a serious matter?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dHickson burst out into laughter.He looked happy to die.Meanwhile, Jackal didn\u2019t understand Hickson\u2019s mind. What\u2019s so serious about \u2018my uncle\u2019?\u201cAnyway. I\u2019ll explain.\u201dHickson stepped in and explained. He had also lost his daughter, too.\u201cThe situation is very, very similar, you and me.\u201dBoth were fathers who loved their children\u2026 And, they both were warriors boasting strong power.\u201cThe kidnapping was done at the right time, calculated very cleverly. I couldn\u2019t find any traces of it, and I was only used here and there, and I ended up being a coward, broken down and depressed.\u201d\u201c\u2026The rumors are familiar to me.\u201d\u201cYou know what I did then?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you attacked all kinds of families viciously.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cYou invaded the winter castle and made a riot, but was overpowered by Duke Heron and exiled to the annex.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of exile? I let him win.\u201dHickson looked into Viola\u2019s eyes. It seemed that he didn\u2019t want to announce the fact that \u2018her Uncle\u2019 had suffered a bad defeat. He then quickly changed the subject.\u201cAnd, you? You attacked the winter castle, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say that it was because we\u2019re threatened.\u201dSo did Hickson. He lost his reason and acted.Viola was right.\u2018And, why didn\u2019t you know that even a child like me could figure it out? Is this all a coincidence?\u2019Hickson continued his remarks.\u201cLooking back, I was possessed by something.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure, though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s some kind of magic.\u201dViola spoke out. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of three years of tracking. I\u2019m working to avenge Uncle Hickson together and to prove myself as a white Veratoux. That\u2019s why I want to help Sir Jackal.\u201dThese words instilled a sense of trust in Jackal.It was more suspicious to just help for no reason.\u201cA move to prove your ability as a white Veratoux. It\u2019s an extremely Veratoux-like idea.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Veratoux.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by some kind of magic?\u201d\u201cA cowardly and crude magic that penetrates the hearts of parents who love their children. Even the most powerful warrior is helpless when attacked with mental hypnosis or suggestive magic.\u201dSo did Hickson, and so did Jackal.They acted like something was out of order. If Hickson had been in a normal state, he wouldn\u2019t have become depressed. Had Jackal been in normal condition, he wouldn\u2019t have even published a column towards Winter Castle.Both of them were in a way that wasn\u2019t their own.\u201cI think they must have paralyzed your sanity by turning your love into fear. You must have been afraid that you would lose your son forever. So, Sir Jackal felt threatened and decided to turn Winter Castle into an enemy. Because your son is important.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that I was threatened or that I lost my son.\u201dJackal wasn\u2019t too easy either.Hearing so, she laughed lightly.\u201cWhen I turn twelve, I can enter the social world. I will be the sharpest sword in the social world.\u201dThis, too, was a very Veratoux-like word.Not the most beautiful flower, but the sharpest sword.\u201cTo do that, I obtained and studied information about my competitors in advance, as well as Jermi, the successor of the Storm Blade.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, I did everything I had available to follow Jermi\u2019s movements.\u201d\u201cThis is a very secure fortress. Within the Storm Fortress, was that possible?\u201d\u201cA place where kidnapping is possible, wouldn\u2019t it be impossible to observe?\u201dJackal was momentarily speechless.Viola\u2019s words felt as if there was no gap in it. It felt like he wasn\u2019t talking to a ten-year-old kid, but to an experienced serpent.In fact, Jackal respected Jermi\u2019s freedom as much as possible. Because of that, he didn\u2019t give much protection since it was Jackal\u2019s theory that his own body should be protected by himself.\u201cBesides, I have a very special relationship with the Terra merchant. Do you often visit the Terra merchant?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn the end, Jackal had no choice but to listen to Viola.Everything was clear.\u201cAfter listening to Miss Viola, I feel like my head is clear.\u201d\u201cDid you feel it, too?\u201dAgreeing, Hickson giggled and laughed. \u201cIt feels like the fog is lifted from my head. I did. How about you?\u201d\u201cSo am I, Sir Hickson.\u201dViola let out a sigh of relief in secret.She only needed to break one shell.They were warriors who had already reached the stage, and if she broke their shells, they would do well on their own.\u201cWhat should I do. Now, I think I know. There must have been something broken.\u201d\u201cBesides, think about it whether Prince Jermi is someone who could be kidnapped so easily. Think about the character of your son.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\u201cThen, the storm sword must do the work of the storm sword, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dJackal called the butler and told him to bring Princess Medea.As Medea has arrived, she tilted her head.\u201cViola? Sir Hickson?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what was said, but the result was surprising.\u201c\u2026So, I\u2019m going to write a handwritten apology to Duke Heron, the lord of Winter Castle. However, I hope that the official apology can be delayed a bit. Please allow a little time.\u201dMedea was internally perplexed, though she didn\u2019t show it outwardly.\u2018What happened\u2026?\u2019It looked like Viola had done something, but she wasn\u2019t sure. Anyway, she didn\u2019t show it on the outside.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but if you give me the letter, I\u2019ll pass it on to my father.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAnd so, Medea accepted the letter.\u2018I have to report to my father.\u2019It was an apology.A variable had arisen. It looked like she had to get another mission again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It seems I was possessed by something. I\u2019m ashamed.\u201dTo that, Viola answered. \u201cIt\u2019s proof that Sir Jackal loves his son. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s shameful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201dAt this moment, Han Arin was sincere.She had been abandoned by her parents. Even though she adored her parents, she also missed them.\u2018I\u2019m a little envious\u2026\u2019The black magic that dazzled Jackal is a magic that only works for \u2018parents who really love their children.\u2019 The storm sword Jackal truly loved his son Jermi.Hickson tapped Viola on the shoulder.\u201cHmmm. Let\u2019s go.\u201dHe was kind of angry as he roughly read the emotions in Viola\u2019s eyes.\u2018She is such a warm-hearted child! To make her compete in Veratoux\u2019s fierce successor race.\u2019After all, the Heron guy didn\u2019t deserve to be her father.With that thought, he vowed once again that he would make himself a much nicer adult than him.Jackal knelt down on one of his knees and met his eyes with Viola.\u201cThank you for saying that, Miss Viola.\u201d\u201cIt was necessary.\u201d\u201cI look forward to your twelve years of age. May you become the sharpest sword.\u201dThe Duke of Heron accepted Jackal\u2019s offer.Actually, this was much better than killing Jackal.\u201cYou\u2019ve accomplished your mission in a different way.\u201d\u201cCan I not kill Sir Jackal?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMedea sighed a sigh of relief inside. Meanwhile, Heron noticed it and opened his mouth to ask.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I thought he was a good warrior. It\u2019s sad to lose a good enemy.\u201dHearing so, he nodded his head. It was indeed a Veratoux style of thinking.\u201cAnd\u2026 He seemed like a good father.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dHeron didn\u2019t respond.After he let Medea out, he read Jackal\u2019s letter again.[ I will surely rescue my son. Until then, please allow time. It won\u2019t take long. ]At this point, Heron laughed at Jackal.Only because of his son\u2026He shot at Winter Castle because of his weakness. Was Jackal such an irrational and stupid person?\u2018And\u2026 He seemed to be a good father.\u2019[ Miss Viola seems to be very interested in Jermi\u2026 Two years later, before entering the social world, I would like to introduce her to Jermi. What do you think, Duke? The two could have a good relationship. ]Crumple.Heron crumpled the letter without realizing it.Then, the door to the office opened. Carlton was the only person who could freely enter Heron\u2019s office without Heron\u2019s permission.\u201cDuke\u2026?\u201dA crumpled piece of paper entered Carlton\u2019s eyes.\u2018What?\u2019He heard that they completed their mission well. That must have been an apology and letter from Jackal, so why did Heron crumple that?\u2018Did something\u2026went wrong?\u2019But, it didn\u2019t seem like things went terribly wrong.The Duke did not issue an order to kill Jackal, and a month later, Jackal issued an official statement of apology.[ Everything I brought up was purely my delusion and was a mistake.I was ignorant with the envy of the foresight of Winter Castle. Forgive me.Duke Heron and the Veratoux family.I bow my head and deeply apologize to all the people of Winter Castle. ]It was a sincere apology that lowered himself to the utmost.This caused Jackal to get laughed out a lot, but that was short-lived.Powerful monsters were created in \u2018Valley of Savages,\u2019 and the storm sword Jackal and Jermi, who returned safely to the storm fortress, succeeded in subjugating the monsters.The fame of the Storm Sword Jackal and his son Jermi rose even more.And just like that, two years passed.Viola was now twelve years old.One spring day when she was twelve, a bird hung a note from its leg and tapped the window. As she walked over to the window, it was a yellow bird with smooth yellow feathers.\u201cBird?\u201dShe found a note hanging from the leg.Opening the note\u2026[ See you soon. ]That was all that was written there.\u2018Who is it?\u2019Were they trying to assassinate her? Viola didn\u2019t think anyone in Winter Castle would do such a crazy thing.She showed Xenon the note.\u201cThe seal of the Storm Fortress is stamped.\u201d\u201cStorm Fortress?\u201dThen she saw a seal in the shape of a whirlwind.\u201cSomeone at the Storm Fortress sent me a note?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably so.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat.\u201d Xenon said, smiling softly.It felt like a gentle wind was blowing.\u201cBecause the Princess is now twelve years old.\u201dTwelve was the age to enter the social world.The twelve-year-old was officially recognized as a noble girl. It was also the age at which marriage offers could come and go.\u201cAnd, the Princess, who turned twelve, is much more beautiful than before.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dShe certainly had grown a lot.However, to Arin Han, she was still a child. She realized again that the standards of the earth and the standards of this place are different.\u201cSo, I dare to worry that the Prince of the Storm Fortress is cajoling you.\u201dWhat is cajoling\u2026?Viola thought she had heard it before.\u2018Caroling\u2026 maybe?\u2019Looking at Xenon\u2019s bright smile, she must have heard it wrong.A few days later.Rumors have spread that the official delegation of the Storm Fortress was arriving. It became a big issue even among the people.\u201cDid you hear that rumor?\u201d\u201cPrince Jermi is coming here!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dJermi.The name made the hearts of many girls flutter.\u201cSmall storm Prince Jermi, are they talking about him?\u201d\u201cWho calls him that? That\u2019s what the savages who like to fight are called.\u201dSmall Storm Jermi\u2026He had another nickname.\u201cThe beautiful Prince has come to the winter castle!\u201dA small storm blew in the winter castle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he had not formally entered the social world, his beauty ignited the hearts of many young girls.Rumor has it that he was the incarnation of a beautiful dragon, that he was beautiful enough to make a mark in history, and that even that neat Levilia flower lost its light in front of Jermi.There were always a lot of rumors around Jermi.Some people were jealous that the rumors had been inflated.\u2018If he\u2019s such a beautiful person, then why wouldn\u2019t he go out of the Storm Fortress?\u2019\u2018It\u2019s like admitting that your rumors are exaggerated.\u2019Needless to say, if he was the son of an aristocrat, he would enter the social world at the age of twelve. They show off their presence at the \u2018Forget-me-not Banquet,\u2019 an aristocratic banquet usually held in May.But, Jermi never showed up at a social gathering.In winter.Azulesia, a famous egg tart restaurant all over the continent.A boy stood in line there.His attire was scruffy and he had a sharp sword around his waist. He was shabby and he wasn\u2019t a good-looking boy, but his eyes were full of sparks.\u201cPrincess Viola loves the egg tarts here.\u201dHe left the official delegation and came to Azulesia.\u2018It\u2019ll be fine because it\u2019s free time, anyway.\u2019Since he had adhered to the official schedule, the rest of the time was free. So, as long as it didn\u2019t make a fuss in the winter castle, it would be fine.\u2018I need to find out a little bit about Princess Viola. \u2018He had heard a lot about Viola.Iron-Blooded Veratoux\u2026The Lady, who became rich at a young age thanks to her great insight.Adopted princess who was known to have a special relationship with the famous Lord Hickson, and may have had a full-fledged war of succession with the First Princess, Medea, even if she was born ten years early.He looked around once.There was no one capable of recognizing his identity.\u2018It\u2019ll be fine because I\u2019m wearing a mask.\u2019This mask came from the winter castle production workshop, and it was also a mask that boasted a quality that was almost magical. There were rumors that it was a business of Seivan Marcos, a disguise master of Winter Castle, but that had not been confirmed.Jermi tapped the person in front of him on the shoulder.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cOh, are you an aspiring apprentice knight? There was a time when I was like that.\u201d\u201cDo you know about Princess Viola Veratoux?\u201dThe man who was very talkative from the beginning proudly presented a lot of information.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s what happened. Do you think that\u2019s all? At the welcome dinner, she got the nickname Iron-Blood Princess. There are also rumors that she slaughtered all the wild boars that were riding in Maple Village.\u201dEven though the reality was a little different, rumors had spread among the people.Jermi opened his eyes wide.\u201cWild boar?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s not just wild boar. They said it was a wild boar that grew up eating magic.\u201d\u201cI heard that even the knights of the Empire find it difficult to kill a monster wild boar alone.\u201dJermi also experienced the monster wild boar. Among them, the most powerful one was a wild boar of a special species called \u2018Saber.\u2019It was a monster that could only be hunted if one was at least a level Seventh Knight.\u201cShe slaughtered them all when she was only ten.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a great person!\u201dJermi thought of a saber boar, but in reality, it was just a wild boar.\u201cYou think it\u2019s the only one? There\u2019s a fact that all of us winter castle people know.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPrincess Viola subjugated every herd of wild boars and toasted with its blood to celebrate.\u201dOf course, that was never the case.\u201cThose who saw her who drank blood said this.\u201dGulp.Jermi was engrossed in the man\u2019s story.\u201cA demon of iron blood. The incarnation of death.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRumors about Viola were largely the same.\u2018I\u2019m curious\u2026\u2019How can rumors spread like that?A ten-year-old with a saber-species wild boar\u2026 Comparable with the famous Medea.\u2018Wow. There are so many people.\u2019As Jermi waited in line for over thirty-minute, the sweet smell of egg tarts flew in the wind.His nose fluttered.\u2018Looks delicious.\u2019He could understand why so many people came to Winter Castle to eat egg tarts just by the smell.After waiting nearly an hour, he was able to enter Azulesia.\u2018Eh\u2026?\u2019There was one person who stood out in Azulesia.\u2018Purple hair.\u2019And, energy as if piercing the lungs and the purple eyes that contained breath-taking threatening aura.Munch!Aulp!Aside from that, he saw a girl who loved egg tarts.\u2018Viola Veratoux!\u2019Viola Veratoux was here.Ironically, the man who said he knew Viola well did not recognize her at all. Jermi didn\u2019t even recognize her at first.\u2018It\u2019s very different from the portrait.\u2019There were no magic pictures of Viola\u2019s face, and the only thing that circulated in the market was portraits.Viola in the portrait had an ominous and gloomy face like a witch.If he hadn\u2019t felt the sharp force emanating from her body itself, he would have never known she was Viola.\u2018Purple hair and eyes much lighter than the portrait\u2026\u2019Although she contained a vicious energy, her eyes themselves were dazzling.Jermi glanced around.\u2018Hmm.\u2019It seemed that the only person who knew the identity of Viola here was the owner of Azulesia. No wonder the owner of Azulezia continued to care for Viola and was watching her.\u201cThree egg tarts.\u201d\u201cWe only sell two per person. Please wait.\u201d\u201cThen, give me two. By the way, who is that person?\u201dThe owner swallowed his saliva.For some reason, he didn\u2019t want to put the name Viola in his mouth.\u2018I\u2019m certain from the reaction.\u2019Interestingly, even Viola wielding so much power within the winter castle could only purchase four egg tarts.It was also bought by Tundra.\u201cTundra. Can I eat this?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t like sweets.\u201dJermi\u2019s ears twitched.\u2018Ah. That boy is Tundra.\u2019He was seventeen years old.Tundra was the same age as him, and he was said to be Sir Hickson\u2019s only disciple. Although he was not a nobleman, he was also called the Sleeping Dragon of the Winter Castle because of his excellent swordsmanship.\u2018But, he\u2019s more famous with the nickname of pet sword.\u2019He didn\u2019t know why he was called a pet sword.All he knew was that he was nicknamed \u2018Pet Sword\u2019 because he didn\u2019t leave her side for even an hour and took care of Viola with all his heart.However, the truth was it was a misinterpretation of \u2018pet dog.\u2019\u201cTwo egg tarts. Here you go.\u201dJermi took the two egg tarts on the tray and started walking.Viola Veratoux.And, towards Tundra.Viola was worried.There was only one egg tart left. She seriously contemplated whether to take this home and eat it here.\u2018It will be warmer and sweeter if you eat it now.\u2019But\u2026\u2018This is the last. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to save it? My stomach\u2019s full.\u2019Her troubles did not last long.Grab!Munch, munch!In the end, she had no choice but to eat. This egg tart was too enticing to bear.However, she found someone.\u2018Eh?\u2019Fluffy silver hair.Full of freckles on the face\u2026 A normal-looking face.A scruffy outfit and a rusty sword.[ \u201cJermi always wore a disguise.\u201d ]A boy who matches the description in the novel was here. At the same time, she also knew that Jermi\u2019s delegation had arrived at Winter Castle.\u2018Is it really Jermi?\u2019She looked at the handle of the sword.[ \u201cHe wore a blue knot tied to his sword.The blue knot was also a symbol of the storm sword, and it was also hand-tied by his younger sibling.\u201d ]A knot made of blue thread appeared.\u2018It\u2019s Jermi!\u2019This was where Jermi Palail appeared.Her mind suddenly became uncomfortable.In the original story, Storm Fortress and the Palail became enemies of Winter Castle. Jermi was the young head of the Palail family and was the person who would fight Medea and the famous \u2018battle of the summit.\u2019The summit battle took place for seven days at the summit of the Serk Mountains, and both suffered serious injuries.\u2018When sister Medea\u2019s was weakened, Viola came by surprise\u2026 and inflicted fatal wounds.\u2019Medea, who loved her family, got caught up in Viola\u2019s trick and was pushed out of the successor position.\u2018Anyway, the important thing was he was a person who is on the right track to be compared to sister Medea in the future.\u2019And\u2026\u2018In the original work, it is a family that considers Veratoux as an enemy.\u2019Of course, things were very different from the original now. However, she knew that the author\u2019s settings didn\u2019t change very well.It had already been confirmed that the flow didn\u2019t change even if the details changed.\u2018There\u2019s nothing good about keeping him close.\u2019Viola didn\u2019t know why he came here.For now, she decided to pretend she didn\u2019t know. After all, it was thanks to the novel that she was able to recognize his disguise.She couldn\u2019t really say, \u2018I saw your disguise in the novel!\u2019\u2018But, why is he coming here?\u2019Tundra\u2019s eyes turned to the silver-haired boy.\u201c\u2026Who?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t many seats. It seems it can fit four people here, can I join you?\u201dAt that, Tundra answered briefly. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause you are a stranger.\u201dDogs must be vigilant for their owners. Tundra thought so.\u201cInstead, I\u2019ll give you an egg tart.\u201d\u201cStill, not\u2026\u201dViola cut her words.\u201cSit down.\u201dShe quickly brought the egg tart from the tray, as if someone was going to steal it. Seeing so, Jermi smiled lightly and sat down in front of her.\u201cAre you aspiring to be an apprentice knight?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m working hard.\u201dTundra laughed openly.\u201cAre you an aspiring apprentice knight\u2026\u201d He growled in a low voice and continued.\u201cWhen you hide your energy like that?\u201dHe then brought the dagger under the table.The dagger touched Jermi\u2019s knee.\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201dJermi laughed.He was indeed a dragon of Winter Castle as Tundra seemed to have read his energy.\u201cI don\u2019t have a plan. I just\u2026\u201dViola, who felt better after eating the egg tart, opened her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, because he\u2019s my guest.\u201d\u201cA guest?\u201d\u201cYes. You can lower your sword. Are you going to use violence in the Winter Castle?\u201dIn the end, Tundra quietly took the dagger.Still, somehow, this silver-haired boy bothered him.\u201cWhat, did you find out who I really am?\u201d\u201cWould you like me to pretend I didn\u2019t know, wearing a blue knot that symbolizes the storm sword?\u201dSmall Storm Jermi.Viola didn\u2019t really want to get involved with him. It was safest to simply keep a moderate distance from this dangerous person.\u2018There\u2019s no variable to reveal my identity from the start.\u2019So, it was hidden.In a controlled environment without variables, if we just chat and part, nothing would happen.\u2018Let\u2019s keep a reasonable distance.\u2019Grab!Munch, munch!And so, she quickly ate the egg tarts.\u201cI\u2019m done. Prince, come to us in Prince\u2019s true form. I\u2019ll get going.\u201dIt meant that she didn\u2019t want to talk to a fake figure in disguise. Now that she got the egg tart, there was nothing to do.Viola stood up first.Tundra followed.He looked at Jermi several times as he walked outside.\u2018Something is ominous.\u2019Even though the reason was unknown, for some reason, the boy felt ominous.Jermi smiled and put the remaining egg tart in his mouth. Without realizing it, he put his hand on his cheek.\u2018Oh, it\u2019s delicious!\u201dThis was the first time he\u2019s eaten such a delicious egg tart.He seemed to understand why Viola had such a happy expression on her face.\u2018Princess Viola.\u2019She felt very different from the rumors.Behind that calm figure, a cruel figure was hidden. When he heard the rumors, she was an iron-blooded princess, but in reality, she wasn\u2019t.\u2018Was I thinking too much like a witch?\u2019Because of that, he didn\u2019t know that she might feel more friendly.\u2018I want to get to know you.\u2019Grab!Munch, munch!That image kept coming to mind. At that thought, Jermi laughed then rubbed his nose\u2014rub, rub.It was very different from the rumors.\u2018Am I saying that the iron-blooded princess is cute\u2026?\u2019He stared at the blue knot hanging from his scabbard. It was the knot that his little sister, Jessi, tied with her small hand.\u2018This is a little dangerous.\u2019Even if she was cute.\u2018I want to be nice to you.\u2019Then, suddenly, there was a commotion.Someone screamed.\u201cHow dare you! It\u2019s not enough to make me, the son of a Viscount, wait so long! You only sell two? Are you trying to deceive me! A commoner believes only in his frail and shallow talents and doesn\u2019t know how high is the sky! I\u2019m going to strike you on the head\u2026!\u201dHowever, the answer of the owner of Azulesia, a commoner, was strange.\u201cIt would be better not to do this, Lord.\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was possible only when there was a \u2018very justifiable cause\u2019 for commoners to respond like that.\u2018For a\u2026 very justifiable cause.\u2019There was no very justifiable cause for Jermi to feel.A commoner must not have any justification for such an answer. It was a dangerous enough situation for Jermi.\u2018If even that boss\u2019s finger is cut off\u2026\u2019Then, this delicious egg tart would disappear.\u2018Isn\u2019t this Princess Viola\u2019s regular restaurant?\u2019Most of the people gathered here are commoners. He couldn\u2019t help it. Because in this world, the proportion of commoners was overwhelmingly higher than that of nobles. Wherever they go, there were more commoners than nobles.\u2018There is no one to stop him.\u2019This was a place he liked.He was willing to find it again next time, so Jermi hoped this place wouldn\u2019t go bankrupt.\u201cHow very unsightly it is in the winter castle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if it seemed that way, but a principle is a principle.\u201d\u201cYou kept saying a principle, and I\u2019m nauseous.\u201dThe boy strode over and slapped the boss.Slap!It didn\u2019t seem like magic. Nevertheless, as if he had been training, the owner\u2019s cheeks swelled up quickly.\u201cI give you one last chance. Bake the leftovers.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. As you may know, this is a favorite place for the Iron-Blood Princess.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cShe also queues up and buys only two. If I sell three or more egg tarts to the Lord, I\u2019m ignoring her.\u201dThe boy laughed as if it was ridiculous.\u201cYou\u2019re joking around with that hole in your mouth.\u201dHe could understand why the owner mentions the iron-blooded Princess. It was because he felt threatened by alluding to the fact that the famous Verratoux princess was behind the owner.\u201cYou dare to threaten me, you scumbag?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat. I\u2019m asking for your understanding, Lord.\u201d\u201cShut up. Tonight. You will be found dead.\u201dJermi felt a presence outside the door.It seemed that Princess Viola and her party were still outside.\u2018Hmm. Then.\u2019He likes it here, and he likes Viola, too.\u2018Shall I get some points?\u2019If the day came when they could formally greet each other, he wondered if he could make a good impression. A good swordsman who helped the owner of her regular shop\u2026 that seemed to be enough.Jermi stepped forward.\u201cLet\u2019s stop here.\u201dThe eldest son of Viscount Seal.Zelton, who turned sixteen this year, was truly upset. In his own estate, things that wouldn\u2019t even dare to look at him with their own eyes kept making eye contact with him and talking back and forth.\u201cWhat else is this?\u201dJudging by his attire, he didn\u2019t seem like a nobleman.The person in front of him was wearing an old sword, so he may be of nobility, though he would never be the son of a prestigious family with a title.\u201cMy name is Jermi, an aspiring apprentice knight.\u201d\u201cJermi?\u201dJermi did not lie about his real name because the name \u2018Jermi\u2019 was not a rare name.\u201cJust the same worthless things.\u201dHearing so, he smiled brightly. A bright smile that could not be covered by the shabby clothes as his face rose like the sun.\u201cWould it hurt to get hit by the worthless things?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dJermi didn\u2019t use the Storm Sword.He just drew his sword.Sreung!A clear sword that did not go well with the old sword rang out, and the tip of the sword touched Zelton\u2019s neck.It was close.Had it gone a little deeper, he would have bled.\u201cHow rude\u2026!\u201dThe knight who was with Zelton behind him also drew his sword.However, the sword was no longer considered a sword anymore.The knight\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018Uh, when\u2026!\u2019As the sword was cut in half and fell to the ground, the knight looked at the cut surface.\u2018The cut surface is clean.\u2019He didn\u2019t even see Jermi wielding his sword. Nevertheless, his own sword was cut off, and the cut edge of the cut sword was too clean. Even if he had a sword of the century made by a master, it was difficult to say.They swallowed their saliva.\u2018Damn it. We got it wrong.\u201dHis appearance was shabby, but he was, by no means, an ordinary person.It was clear that the knight was at least level Nine or higher. There were times when a good knight walked around like a beggar like that.\u201cHow about it? You shouldn\u2019t be angry anymore, do you?\u201d\u201cTom, tomorrow is my birthday, so I will forgive you in a good way.\u201dZelton snorted \u2018huhng!\u2019 and turned around. He pretended to be okay, but his legs were trembling.\u2018What the hell is that guy?\u2019His appetite had plummeted.It was his first time seeing a senior knight. So, he was terrified to see the skills of a senior knight right in front of his eyes.\u2018Let\u2019s get out of here quickly.\u2019Outside, there was a pretty girl and a boy with golden hair.Zelton hurriedly adjusted his clothes and began to walk in a bad way.The door would be closed, too.He was no longer scared.\u201cOut of the way.\u201dIt was a step as if claiming to be a ferocious and wild man. He thought he looked like he had a man\u2019s taste when he behaved so harshly.Sixteen-year-old Zelton thought so.Viola wasn\u2019t particularly angry.\u2018Oh, my.\u2019There were always kids like that everywhere\u2014little kids who think they know how to be strong. Judging from Viola\u2019s mental age, he was still an immature child.But\u2026The companion sword, Tundra\u2019s eyes lit up.Jermi thought he had scored.\u2018Hehe.\u2019The door was blocking it, though Viola must have already felt it.\u2018I saved the owner of your regular shop, Princess Viola.\u2019Thinking he made a good impression, he slowly enjoyed the one remaining egg tart.\u2018I did my best developing that footwork.\u2019It was pretty satisfying.Viola probably liked it very much. If he had shown her this much footwork, he wondered if she would at least want to be friends.\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s good.\u2019He thought she scored a lot thanks to a dimwit who didn\u2019t even have aristocratic dignity. Meanwhile, Viola bit her lip and turned her body towards the Duke\u2019s castle.\u2018It\u2019s a dangerous world, too.\u2019She looked through the gap in the open door.Jermi\u2019s neat footwork. It was just a simple hair knife with no special skills.\u2018Too fast\u2026\u2019It seemed that it would be best not to get close.She asked carefully, \u201cTundra. Have you seen Jermi\u2019s footwork?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cIt was fast.\u201d\u201cBetter than you?\u201dTundra thought for a moment. This, he thought, was the Master\u2019s test and evaluation. So, he answered calmly.\u201cIn terms of speed, I think he was faster than me.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI will try harder.\u201dNo.Viola didn\u2019t mean it that way. It was a little burdensome for Tundra to suddenly burn with enthusiasm. Nonetheless, she ignored Tundra and continued to move her steps towards the Duke\u2019s castle.\u2018Faster than Tundra.\u2019Also\u2026He was too risky.\u2018Dangerous. I have to keep my distance.\u2019Returning to his accomodation, Zelton beat his escort knight harshly.\u201cWhat\u2019s your mission?\u201d\u201cIt is to escort the Lord.\u201d\u201cHowever?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cDo you know that my father pays you for that?\u201dZelton whipped him for a while, and his escort knight silently endured.After a while.He was exhausted and missed his whip.\u201cHeuk\u2026heuk\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lord.\u201dThere was no excuse for the opponent to be too strong. Anyway, he didn\u2019t do a proper escort, and he thought it was his fault.That was the way a knight thought.That night.Zelton left the accommodation with the escort knight.\u201cHis house. Have you found it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZelton has always been educated as a precious being.\u2018You are a great kid.\u2019\u2018You are better than anyone else.\u2019\u2018You can do really well.\u2019That\u2019s how he learned it.His mother always said so. It became poison for Zelton.\u201cI\u2019m going to catch you.\u201d\u201cThis is the winter castle, Lord.\u201d\u201cYou can just kill them outside the winter castle. Drag him away.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe escort knight realized that he couldn\u2019t break Zelton\u2019s stubbornness. When he received an order, he obeyed it\u2014that was the right way as a knight.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dBut, he also wanted to ask.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t the boy named Jermi be punished?\u2019The person who insulted him in front of many commoners was Jermi. So, isn\u2019t it right to take revenge on Jermi?Why does the owner have to die?\u2018He was a commoner and disrespectful, but\u2026 He didn\u2019t even say anything wrong.\u2019What\u2019s more, even the iron-blooded Princess of Verratoux kept the rules here.Zelton could not break that principle. It meant that there was no reason why the owner had to die.\u2018Should I follow this command?\u2019Still, he had to follow.He thought that he was right as a knight.Thump, thump.As he walked the streets at night, the night streets of Winter Castle were peaceful and quiet. There were drunk people scattered all over the place.\u201cLord. The fact that they are so drunk and lying around\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must mean that they are fools with neither dignity nor culture.\u201dThat was not it.This meant that the security here was very good\u2026 So, he won\u2019t be able to kill the owner outside the winter castle because the boundaries would be tight.The knight swallowed the words.After all, Zelton was a character who must see with his own eyes to be satisfied.Around the Winter Castle. Among the houses where commoners lived, he saw a house with a fairly large gate.\u201cAre you sure this is the house?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBreak it.\u201dHe broke the wooden door and entered.\u201cDoes a commoner live in a house with a garden?\u201dThere was a small garden.\u201cDid the winter castle commoners have thoughts or not?\u201dIt was the first time he\u2019s seen a commoner\u2019s house have a garden. Even though it was a small garden, it was too luxurious for commoners.\u201cAnyone would think it was a noble house. So, it must have been why he had a stiff neck.\u201dFar ahead, there were five steps.A boy was sitting there.It was a blond boy.\u201cYou also have a stiff neck.\u201d\u201cWhat else are you?\u201d\u201cMe? A mercenary who dreams of being a dog.\u201dThe blond boy was Tundra.Zelton got agitated at the word mercenary. He snorted \u2018huhng!\u2019 and said, \u201cWhat kind of nonsense is this?\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cYour tongue is short on the subject of a mercenary.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re short, too, you bastard.\u201dAt that, Zelton\u2019s face flushed red. He was insulted by a mercenary like this, besides, he was already sensitive.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you, too.\u201d\u201cKilling? This is winter castle?\u201d\u201cSomething like that. Maybe, you\u2019ll find out!\u201dZelton pointed his finger at Tundra.\u201cKnock him out. Take him out of the winter castle and kill him.\u201dThis knight was a second-class apprentice knight, so it wouldn\u2019t be comparable to a mercenary.\u2026Or, so he thought.However, the reality was the opposite.Changgrang!As if breaking glass, the sword of the escort knight was shattered.\u2018What is this again?\u2019The escort knight\u2019s eyes darkened.Even though it was a sword he bought in a hurry at the weapon shop, but it wasn\u2019t something that could be broken so easily. Nevertheless, the sword was completely shattered, and fragments flew all over the place.\u201cObviously, you said you would kill me first. This is self-defense.\u201dTundra was walking briskly.He swung his sword.\u201cYou dare to touch the Master\u2019s favorite shop?\u201dViola was happiest when eating egg tarts, and this guy was trying to ruin that happiness\u2026?With the side of the sword, he knocked Zelton and the escort knight. He wanted to kill him, but he couldn\u2019t because this was the Winter Castle area.\u2018It\u2019s easy.\u2019As he battled monsters like Vixen every day, it was very easy to deal with them.Finally, the door opened and the owner of Azulesia bowed deeply.\u201cThank you, I don\u2019t know how to repay this favor.\u201d\u201cNot the ones at the store.\u201dIt was against the rules if he gave something sold at the store. But, if it\u2019s homemade, it\u2019s a different story.\u201cTen egg tarts baked separately at home. The Princess will be satisfied with that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bake even a hundred. Thank you very much.\u201dTundra barely caught the rising corner of his lips.He was very excited inside.\u2018If ten\u2026 Will the Master be pleased? Did I do well?\u2019When he thought of that, he was thrilled. It was Tundra\u2019s happiness to see Viola eating deliciously and looking happy.\u201cI would like it to be especially delicious.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dTwo days later.The only son of Viscount Seal was executed.In front of the southern gate of Winter Castle, his neck was hung, and startling rumors began to spread within the winter castle.Iron-blooded Princess.There were rumors about Viola Verratoux.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He simply summed up the situation in one word.\u2018These days, rats are fearless. How dare they do such thing in the Winter Castle.\u2019And he cut his neck himself.He hung his neck at the south gate of the winter castle and displayed it as if he were a worker bee.Some nobles protested, though Duke Heron did not care at all.Meanwhile, some nobles objected, and some nobles were silent. Only a few nobles said that Duke Heron did very well.However, among the common people, the story was different.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cOf course! Am I not a citizen of the Winter Castle?\u201d\u201cWhat happened? Is the newsletter true?\u201d\u201cPrincess Viola sent her pet sword.\u201d\u201cShe herself?\u201d\u201cYeah. She\u2019s a regular in our shop.\u201d\u201cShe sent her pet sword because she was a regular?\u201d\u201cHey! It can\u2019t be! As one of the owners of Winter Castle, she has protected the citizens of Winter Castle because you are a citizen of Winter Castle!\u201dThe commoners in Winter Castle were overwhelmed.Their master, the Duke of Veratoux, beheaded the nobleman for them. Because of that, this became a message and touched the hearts of commoners.\u2018Winter Castle never forsakes the people of Winter Castle.\u2019And, at the center of this work was the \u2018Pet Sword.\u2019Pet Sword Tundra.\u201cYou moved as fast as a lightning bolt and cut off Zelton\u2019s limbs in an instant?\u201d\u201cAh, no, that, that\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t.He did arrest Zelton, but Tundra did not directly kill Zelton.\u201cThose who torment the citizens of Winter Castle deserved it even if they suffer like that.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe rumors that were spread were a bit twisted. Viola, who witnessed the torment of the citizens of Winter Castle, sent her minion, Tundra, to slaughter him.\u201cThe rumors weren\u2019t wrong either.\u201d\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d\u201cIron-Blood Princess. A Veratoux, who is more Veratoux than anyone else. Rumors about the adopted Princess of Veratoux.\u201dWhere Viola had no idea, the voice of praise for Viola began to rise little by little.Heron\u2019s office.It was a quiet time, past eleven o\u2019clock at night.The scarlet light of the magic candle touched the Duke\u2019s cheek. Viola gazed at the Duke\u2019s orange-tinted cheeks, and her legs trembled hidden under her skirt.\u201cWhy did you call me?\u201dHe had been silent for thirty minutes after calling her as he was signing papers for half an hour, and he hadn\u2019t even looked towards her.\u2018Why?\u2019He was the person who decapitated even the Viscount\u2019s son for acting up in the Winter Castle.There was talk of the decapitating done in the office. It felt as if the smell of blood had been tainted in this place.\u2018Why don\u2019t you talk to me!\u2019After thirty minutes passed, the Duke finally opened his mouth.\u201cWhy did I call you?\u201d\u2018How would I know that? Father called me, so I just came. So, why are you asking me that, huh?\u2019Nevertheless, she had to come up with a reasonable answer.Viola felt it again this time.Heron was obviously the absolute supreme in this world, and there was no way to go against the absolute. Having fallen into such a world, wouldn\u2019t it be necessary to adapt and survive?She answered the question with a question.\u201cWhy did you kill the eldest son of Viscount Seal?\u201d\u201cBecause I think you want it.\u201d\u2026Yes?Me?After a long time, Viola\u2019s head was dazed.\u2018Why did he think that way?\u2019He seemed to have misunderstood somewhere. In fact, it was true that Zelton\u2019s quality was bad, though he did not commit a mortal sin either.\u201cWeren\u2019t you planning on moving in earnest, too?\u201dHeron\u2019s eyes narrowed.Viola was somehow afraid. She didn\u2019t know what those eyes were saying.His eyes seemed to be stuck in her heart!\u2018Moving in earnest? Me\u2026?\u2019She quickly understood why he was saying that.\u2018You interpreted it as jumping into a full-fledged succession competition\u2026\u2019That keyword became a hint. Viola seemed to understand why Duke Heron had done so much work.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u2018\u2026No. That\u2019s not right.\u2019She didn\u2019t want things to get this big. She thought she would break one or two places and send him back. Viola didn\u2019t think he would kill the Viscount\u2019s son without trial.The Duke sat back.Judging by his appearance, it was as if he was expecting the following words from Viola.\u2018Please don\u2019t expect it\u2026!\u2019Aside from her inner thoughts, Viola had to carry on her words as Viola Veratoux.\u201cWinter Castle has always been protecting mankind from \u2018where it snows.\u2019 As time passed, people got used to it. So, that\u2019s why a bastard like Zelton dared to commit murder within the Winter Castle.\u201d\u201cTherefore?\u201d\u201cYou wanted to send a warning. For those who defied the authority of Veratoux in Winter Castle.\u201dIt was a warning to the world.It was interpreted as that\u2026.Actually, she never thought about it this far, but anyway, that\u2019s the result.\u201cAs a result of this incident, the nobles who will remain silent will remain silent.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe nobles who will rebel will rebel.\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean to share it?\u201d\u201cAs a white Veratoux, I need to clearly distinguish my comrades from my enemies.\u201dThe Duke grinned and said, \u201cYou mean those who are silent are our potential allies, and those who rebel are potential enemies?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dViola shook her head.\u201cIt\u2019s the other way around.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI think father\u2019s treatment was right, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s legal.\u201dViola\u2019s heart pounded.\u2018After all, what you did was illegal! I won\u2019t go against my heart.\u2019She knew by reading the original story. Heron was never a tyrant who acted as he pleased. A lot of people know that, but that\u2019s not true.\u2018Nevertheless\u2026\u2019Her hands and feet were trembling.She had to use extreme patience to keep it from coming off.\u201cThose who are silent are cowards. And those who rebel are fearless madmen.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cNeither of them are friends. Winter Castle is only Winter Castle, I don\u2019t need a colleague.\u201dIt was a wild word, but it was also Heron\u2019s favorite. After she said what Heron wanted to hear, he brought up the subject.\u201cBut, I like crazy people more than cowards.\u201dThere was a faint smile on Heron\u2019s lips. He had never had such a satisfying conversation with a child since the First Princess Medea.It was even more enjoyable than talking to Medea.\u201cAmong the opposing aristocrats, those who have no personal acquaintance with Viscount Seal and have a clean past. I plan to embrace them.\u201d\u201cIn the future, when you rule Veratoux?\u201dViola\u2019s heart was pounding, she felt like she was falling!No. Not her.Her sister, Medea.As her father knew, she was really strong. She was going to enjoy the honey after helping out.\u201cYes.\u201d\u2026Damn it.This wasn\u2019t it.\u201cIt\u2019s a good attitude.\u201d\u201cIn addition.\u201dViola wanted to cry, but she spoke to her calmly. \u201cThere was something special about the love Viscount and Viscountess Seal have for their child.\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cI have to enter the social world at the age of twelve, too.\u201dIt meant studying in advance about a family with children of that age.\u2018I didn\u2019t study it, but I know it because I read it as a novel.\u2019Anyway, according to the content of the novel, the Viscount would never stand still. Although it was developed a little differently from the novel, Viscounty Seal and Duchy Veratoux were destined to collide one day.\u201cViscounty Seal will definitely take action one way or another.\u201dIt was the same in the novel.Viscount\u2019s son, Zelton, was defeated by Vixen.[ \u201cI will never forgive my son\u2019s enemy, Duke Veratoux.\u201d ]And Viscount Seal marches towards the winter castle.The size of his army was only around five hundred, and they were all shot and killed at the south gate of Winter Castle.In the novel, Duke Heron praised Viscount Seal.[ \u201cYour actions were right.\u201d ]It was cowardly to remain still when your son was dead. It was the right thing to do as a parent to rush and lash out like this.It was Heron\u2019s idea in the novel.[ \u201cBut, why did you run to me even though you knew you were going to die?\u201d ][ \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a father.\u201d ][ \u201cYou mean you know you\u2019re going to die?\u201d ][ \u201cEveryone does stupid things at times. If that stupidity is meaningful.\u201d ]And, Heron hung Viscount Seal instead of beheading him.Ironically, he didn\u2019t spare financial and forceful support for Viscountess Seal, who had lost the Viscount.The novel also had something like this.[ \u201cViscountess Seal had a child in her belly.\u201d ]Viscountess Seal named the child Bengas.Bengas meant revenge.Bengas became a powerful wizard and becomes the enemy of Duchy Veratoux\u2026 That was the content of the novel.It was a fictional world with a lot of things done.A worldview in which he killed the father to create a powerful enemy named Jermi Palail, and killed both his older brother and father to create another enemy named Bengas Seal.[ Shadow of Veratoux ] was such a fictional world.Heron asked, \u201cWhat action are you going to take?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to ask the Empire to intervene.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cThe Empire will not accept arbitration.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause there is no point. The Empire cannot actively engage in work that does not make any sense.\u201d\u201cBut, wouldn\u2019t the cause lie in Viscount Seal?\u201d\u201cThe first person to break the law of winter castle is Zelton.\u201dA moment of silence passed.However, unexpected words came out of Heron\u2019s mouth.\u201cAnd, he tried to steal your pleasure.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dFor a moment, Viola thought she had heard it wrong.\u201cEgg tart. Isn\u2019t it your favorite?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 true.\u201dViola coughed then continued, \u201cViscount Seal, who was also shunned by the Empire, will make the final choice.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of final choice do you mean?\u201d\u201cAre there any parents who will stand still after losing a child?\u201d\u201cUsually they\u2019ll stay still. If the opponent is the winter castle.\u201d\u201cAccording to my understanding, Viscount Seal will never stand still. Surely he will march towards the winter castle.\u201dHeron nodded once.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll have to kill him honorably.\u201dNo.Then, there would be an enemy called Archmage Bengas.At least let\u2019s prevent that, father\u2026\u201cAre you sure he will march? At the risk of death?\u201d\u201cHumans sometimes do stupid things. If that is meaningful.\u201dIt was the words of Viscount Seal in the original story.[ \u201cEveryone does stupid things at times. If that stupidity is meaningful.\u201d ]Viola opened her mouth.\u201cI want to do stupid things, too.\u201d\u2018For my splendid old age. For a long and clean life\u2026 To prevent the birth of an archmage named Bengas!\u2019\u201cPlease send me as a special envoy. I want to visit the Viscounty Seal.\u201dThis alone may not be enough.Like a Veratoux, she added a word, \u201cI\u2019ll prove myself as a white Veratoux. Just like in Storm Fortress.\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He held ten egg tarts in his hand.As Viola once said,[ \u201cI can eat about ten.\u201d ]There are only ten.\u2018Will she enjoy it?\u2019This was an egg tart made with special care. He hoped Viola would eat this and like it.\u201cI hope you like it.\u201dJust imagining it made him excited, but he was also worried. When it came to things related to Viola, he cared about everything for no reason.\u2018She\u2019s not going to get mad, right?\u2019She would like it because it was an egg tart that was obtained through a legitimate method.The sweet smell of egg tarts pierced his nose.\u2018Looks delicious.\u2019His mouth was drooling.In fact, even Tundra really likes this egg tart. He liked Viola, so he always gave it away. It was a taste that could not be tasted anywhere other than Winter Castle, and it was fortunate that there was Azulesia in Winter Castle.Knock, knock.He knocked and entered Viola\u2019s room.\u201cTen egg tarts. It is said that the owner of Azulezia made it with special care.\u201dFortunately, Viola liked it.After telling him to bring me some bitter green tangerine tea, she ate the egg tarts.Grab!Munch, munch!It was already the fourth.\u201cTundra. Sit down, too.\u201d\u201cHow can a dog sit at his master\u2019s table?\u201dTundra just stood upright and looked down at Viola. Viola was uncomfortable with that, so she spoke like a Veratoux, brutally.\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant to look down from a place higher than me.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dTundra knelt down in that position.His eye level was lower than that of Viola sitting in the chair. She seemed to have given the order a bit wrong. Because of that, she became more uncomfortable.\u201cJust sit down.\u201dTundra was obsessed with manners too much.\u2018Anyway, so stubborn.\u2019She could force him to sit in front of her, but she didn\u2019t have to.\u2018It\u2019s the same as Brother Hanjun, stubborn in strange places.\u2019Han Jun was also stubborn in strange places.At that, she firmly clenched her lips. When she said it was unpleasant, he immediately accepted it and knelt down on his knees and looked at the ground, that inflexible figure.That look that made her knees tingle, but she didn\u2019t show anything.\u2018Why do you act the same as brother as time passes by?\u2019The older he got, the more so.The largest portion of Han Arin\u2019s memory was filled with Han Jun, who was in his late teens to early twenties. Tundra turned seventeen and grew closer to the image of Kang Hanjun in her memory\u2026\u2018Brother liked sweets a lot, too.\u2019He was even called the Chocolate Killer in school.\u201cCan you give me one, too?\u201d\u201cHow can a dog eat with his master? I am happy just spending time with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you like sweets?\u201d\u201cI hate sweetsHowever, why do you swallow your saliva? But, why are you flapping your nostrils?\u201cDo you really hate it?\u201d\u201cYes. I hate it.\u201dViola\u2019s eyes narrowed. It was obvious to anyone he liked it, though he said he hates it.\u201cI hate lying dogs.\u201dFlinch.At that, his body trembled.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again. Do you like sweets?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTundra paused for a moment.He was pretty awkward. Now, if he said he likes sweets, he was lying. Nonetheless, if he said he hated it again, he thought Viola would be disappointed.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201dViola forced an egg tart into Tundra\u2019s mouth.Still, he did not respond. He put the egg tart in his mouth and murmured.\u201cHank uuu (thank you).\u201d\u201cBe honest in front of me.\u201d\u201cHeh (yes).\u201dA little bit of egg cream was smeared on the corners of Tundra\u2019s lips. It seemed that he didn\u2019t even know that she was so nervous.\u2018Cute.\u2019Was brother like this?In her memory, fifteen-year-old Kang Han-jun was very big, but looking as the current Viola, he wasn\u2019t that big\u2026 To her, with the spirit of Han Arin, Tundra was like a really young Kang Hanjun.\u2018What can I say to make him feel more comfortable with me?\u201d\u2019Just because she told him to be comfortable, didn\u2019t mean he could be comfortable with her. She adapted to the fictional world of [ Shadow of Veratoux ] and opened her mouth.\u201cYou are a dog, you know?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo you know the difference between humans and dogs?\u201d\u201cIf you tell me, I will study.\u201dSeeing him answer in an extremely polite way made her feel something even more stuffy.\u201cPeople have to think deeply, dogs don\u2019t have to think deeply.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you like it, you don\u2019t like it. If you\u2019re happy, you\u2019re happy. If you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re hungry. You just have to be honest. You\u2019re a dog. Why is a dog considering many things?\u201dIf you want to eat, say you want to eat.If you like it, you can say you like it.She didn\u2019t know what was so hard about it.\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201d\u201cIf you know you\u2019re sorry, keep your identity. Understand?\u201dTundra looked like he had been hit in the head.Everything Viola said was right.A dog was a dog\u2026 Dogs shouldn\u2019t pretend to be people.\u2018You scolded me.\u2019He was heartbroken. Then, with that thought, he felt like he had to show a change.\u2018I\u2019m being honest, like a dog.\u2019Viola wanted it, so Tundra decided to do just that. It was not going to happen overnight, though he decided to be a little more honest in front of Viola.So, the next day, he found Viola again.Just in time, Viola was drinking tea with Xenon.\u201cI\u2019m going to give it to my master.\u201dHe decided to act like a dog. He was unstoppable, the footsteps of the pet sword, who was once scolded and taught.Viola tilted her head.\u201cFlower?\u201dIt was a vase of white flowers.Xenon\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cIt\u2019s a marguerite flower.\u201dMarguerite had pure white petals, and the central flower core was a yellow flower. Viola\u2019s eyes touched the vase.\u201cI remembered my master paying attention to this flower that bloomed by the roadside.\u201d\u201cTundra. Do you know the language of this flower?\u201d\u201cI do not know.\u201dTundra was confident.He didn\u2019t know the language of flowers, he just remembered that Viola\u2019s eyes touched that flower. Because of that, he wanted to bring it.Viola murmured.\u201cTrue love. Prophecy. Revealing the secret\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes the Princess study flower language, too?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dViola just stared at the vase. She didn\u2019t know why this was happening again.\u2018It was an amulet that Brother Han Jun gave me.\u2019\u2018You take this.\u2019\u2018It is said that having this brings you good luck.\u2019At the time, Han Jun didn\u2019t even know the name of this flower. He said he just brought it because it was pretty. Marguerite became a talisman for Han Arin, who had a difficult life in school.After a long time, she had looked up the dictionary.[ The flower language of Marguerite is \u2018True love, prophecy, love fortune-telling, and revealing secrets\u2019. ]So, Han Arin thought so secretly.She even imagined that Kang Han Jun as a child confessed to her through flowers.\u2018But brother. You gave me marguerite flowers a long time ago.\u2019\u2018Ah. Did I?\u2019\u2018Huh. It was a talisman for me.\u2019\u2018I should have given you one or two amulets. Because you are such a crybaby.\u2019\u2018Do you know the flower language of Marguerite, brother?\u2019\u2018Well? What?\u2019\u2018Actually, I don\u2019t know.\u2019Han Arin pretended to not know, but she knew. It was just that she was ashamed of being excited for no reason.\u201cLooking at it, it seems that you don\u2019t know the language of flowers at all.\u201d Xenon said.\u201cI didn\u2019t know, does that matter, Xenon?\u201d\u201cNo. If the princess doesn\u2019t take issue with it, it won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dAt that, his eyes narrowed even more.\u201cBy the way, the vase has been treated with special magic. It must be expensive.\u201d\u201cI also get Veratoux\u2019s salary.\u201dFor the past three years, Tundra had been paid by the Duchy of Veratoux.This was Xenon\u2019s consideration. He set the minimum cost of maintaining dignity so that there was no shortage to serve Princess Viola.\u201cIf it\u2019s something like this, you need to save up for three years without spending a single penny?\u201dTundra nodded his head.\u201cI am grateful to be able to present three years of hard work.\u201d\u2018I hope Viola likes it.\u2019\u2018I hope you are happy about it.\u2019\u2018I hope you enjoy it.\u2019That thought ran through his mind.\u2018Does she like it?\u2019With that thought in mind, he looked into Viola\u2019s eyes.She seemed to feel neither good nor bad. She stood with a curious expression, and she continued to stare at the vase of Marguerites.\u2018Why are you doing this to me, the hell?\u2019Is this a coincidence?A person with the same face as Kang Han Jun suddenly presented me with flowers.\u2018Probably Marguerite, maybe I don\u2019t even know the language of flowers.\u2019Why were you acting the same as Kang Han Jun?\u2018You are not brother Han Jun\u2026\u2019Viola opened her mouth.Even though he wasn\u2019t Kang Kang Jun, she kept seeing Kang Hanjun. She had to hold her heart.\u2018He\u2019s not Brother Hanjun.\u2019Viola strengthened her heart.She said coldly, \u201cHow about spending three years of effort on weapons and armor? If you\u2019re a dog, be like a dog. Sharpen your teeth.\u201dIt was both a venom towards Tundra and a whip towards Viola herself.After a few days.The official second mission of the white Veratoux Viola has been dropped.\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019A mission that Viola herself requested.Duke Heron accepted Viola\u2019s request.\u2018I can\u2019t believe the day has come when I will be dispatched as a special envoy.\u2019In fact, it was the second time.Because she\u2019s been to Storm Fortress, too. She wanted to live a long and happy life, but at the age of twelve, she was dispatched as a special envoy.\u2018Anyway. I\u2019ll do well, right?\u2019It felt like she was constantly getting involved in big things, but maybe it\u2019s just her feelings.\u2018Still, it would be better to suffer as a special envoy now than for the Archmage Bengas to appear one day, perhaps.\u2019The news of Veratoux\u2019s dispatch of a special envoy was covered in considerable depth in several newsletters, and rumors about Viola began to spread around the world.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Duchy of Veratoux sent a special envoy.\u201d\u201cFrom Veratoux?\u201d\u201cThey killed the son of Viscount Seal or something.\u201d\u201cAre they going to send a special envoy?\u201dFor the common people, Winter Castle had been perceived as a terrifying place. It was not a place to send a special envoy just because he killed at least one of the Viscount\u2019s children.\u201cBut it was a twelve-year-old kid who was sent as an envoy.\u201d\u201cHey, hey. Be careful with what you say. What do you mean kid?!\u201dThe man carefully looked around.\u201cYou don\u2019t know the rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d\u201cThe rumor that the \u2018Thousand Kills\u2019 Duke adopted a witch five years ago.\u201d\u201cWitch? What does that mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either. At the age of seven, she killed bandits and ate their flesh. Oh, and a welcome dinner? I think they drank the blood of the monster there.\u201dIt was Vixen, not Viola, who killed the bandit at the age of seven.Viola had just simply saved Tundra. She never drank monster blood. She drank not the blood of the devil, but the potion \u2018Viola.\u2019 However, as always, rumors have been twisted and misinterpreted.\u201cLet\u2019s be careful.\u201d\u201cYeah, yes. That\u2019s right.\u201dRumors about Viola have been twisted and twisted.Rumors, that would make the blood boil upside down as they spread little by little across the continent. Nevertheless, there were people who grasped Viola Veratoux a little more objectively.It was Selina who started a deal with the internal affairs of the Empire three years ago.Selina said, \u201cInside the winter castle, a child named Viola Veratoux seems to be getting a lot of favors.\u201d\u201cLooks like that.\u201d\u201cEven though she is an iron-blooded Veratoux, it is said that she cares very much for the people of Winter Castle. The people of Winter Castle call themselves citizens and are considered to be proud.\u201dShe became Minister of Finance at the age of thirty-seven, and was now second in command of the Monarch Empire. She was the only person in the world who used the title second in command.King of Swords Nellach Freuds Caliburn.He asked, sitting on the edge of the bed in light clothes.\u201cDid you say she was twelve?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen did you start watching the kid carefully?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been since the welcome dinner party of Veratoux five years ago. With a splendid appearance, she was recognized as Veratoux at once.\u201dShe was talking like it was funny.\u201cShe\u2019s also the kid who has benefited greatly from occupying the land to develop the Golden Road.\u201d\u201cIs it a coincidence?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s most likely a coincidence, but at the same time it doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe kid secured as much cash as she could, and poured it there.\u201dThe Emperor coughed in vain.He glanced around. \u201cPutting all the eggs in one basket. No dignity.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only two of us, so what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cA gourd that leaks on the inside leaks from the outside as well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not leaking. Did you see any leaks?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t speak.\u201dSelina ruffled the emerald-colored hair behind her ear. She walked lightly, and she sat down next to the Emperor.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201dThen she places her hand over the Emperor\u2019s hand.The Emperor\u2019s face turned red.\u2018You\u2019re cute.\u2019The Emperor was obviously a great man. At least, his talent for swords was unmatched, and he even earned the title of Emperor of Swords.However, thanks to him sticking to knitting*, he was a foolish person who doesn\u2019t know much about other things of the world.[ T/N: It was a phrase that meant to only focus on one thing. ]The Emperor Selina saw was pretty cute.\u201cSe, Selina. You\u2019re reporting now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cDid there ever be an imperial law that says you can\u2019t hold hands and report?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can make such a law. Your Majesty is the only sun of the Empire.\u201d\u201cBut, I never said that I would make it.\u201d\u201cThen, can I report and hold hands?\u201d\u201cDo, do it.\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep stuttering?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201dNellach\u2019s face flushed red.As Selina\u2019s hand touched him, and his heart pounded.\u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d\u201cI am the Emperor.\u201d\u201cIs there a law that says the emperor can\u2019t be cute?\u201d\u201cRep, report.\u201dSelina smiled and continued her report, \u201cShe is a very insightful and analytical child. She also wisely solved the problem with the Storm Fortress this time. Prince Jermi, who is also called the Beautiful Prince, seems to be interested in Viola.\u201dThe Emperor nodded his head.In fact, his heart was pounding right now, so the report didn\u2019t come in properly.\u201cYour Majesty. Are you listening to me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201dSelina rested her head on theEmperor\u2019s shoulder.Her hair smelled nice.The Emperor grabbed his pounding heart and clenched his toes tight. It was much more comfortable to go to the battlefield and face ten thousand soldiers.\u201cI think the key is to see how she\u2019s going to deal with Viscount Seal this time.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAccording to my expectations\u2026\u201dShe spoke carefully.\u201cBefore Princess Viola arrives at Viscounty Seal, Viscount Seal is likely to be dead. If she\u2019s unlucky, Viola will be a murder suspect who suspected Viscount Seal.\u201dXenon sat down on one of his knees.\u201cThe shoelaces are untied, Princess.\u201dViola stood still and looked at Xenon, who was sitting there. With a gentle touch, Xenon tied the knot on the leather shoelace again.\u201cYou have to ride a horse for a long time, and you have to go through a barren mountain road. Didn\u2019t I teach you that you have to tie it up like this so it won\u2019t come loose?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t learn it.\u201dShe was only taught unilaterally.\u2018No, why do you need magic to tie your shoelaces?\u2019This knot was finished using a special method by infusing magic by using a magic technique, Viola could not learn this.\u2018I\u2019m not good at tying knots.\u2019She used to hear nagging from Hanjun every day.\u2018You still can\u2019t tie your shoelaces like that?\u2019\u2018I do not know. It\u2019s difficult.\u2019\u2018Tying shoelaces?\u2019He laughed like crazy.\u2018When I see that you are good at studying, you are an idiot. Why can\u2019t you tie your shoelaces like this?\u2019\u2018Ah. Don\u2019t make fun of me!\u2019\u2018Well, it\u2019s okay. At least a person has one flaw. But I don\u2019t know where there are people who can\u2019t tie their shoelaces.\u2019\u2018Brother!\u2019Stop teasing me, I\u2019m frustrated too! Just as she was about to say that, Kang Hanjun bowed his head.\u2018Ugh. I\u2019ll just do it.\u2019Since then, he has always tied Han Arin\u2019s shoelaces. Viola opened her mouth shamelessly.\u201cYou can do it.\u201d\u201cAm I?\u201d\u201cYes. You.\u201dStrangely, she didn\u2019t know how to tie a knot.Even though she learned and learned, she forgot. So, in that case, it was better to just not learn at all since not being able to learn, and not learning at all are two different things.\u2018It would be strange if Veratoux couldn\u2019t do this either.\u2019Veratoux should be close to perfection in every way.That was the direction Veratoux was pursuing. That was why she deliberately decided not to learn how to tie a knot because she doesn\u2019t want to expose my flaws.However, Xenon was a little strange.He had a brighter smile than usual.With a little lie, it seemed that the sun had risen on his face.\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201dYes? What\u2026?\u201cI\u2019ll always do it. Next to the princess.\u201dWas this something to feel so happy about?With that thought, Viola tilted her head inside.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been given permission to be with the Princess.\u201dWith Xenon\u2019s help, she got on her horse. Even if she didn\u2019t tie the knot well, she got used to horseback riding.\u2018It would be better to go by carriage.\u2019The road to the Viscounty Seal was too daunting to go by wagon.There were also roads, but moving along the road took about a month. So, they took a path through the mountain range.\u201cAs the Princess knows, you have to pass through eight large and small mountain ranges to reach the Viscounty Seal.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cMaybe, we can expect multiple raids.\u201dAmong them, there would be some gossip like a bandit, and there would be enemies of Veratoux.\u2018In the beginning, my father\u2019s nickname was a thousand-kill Duke.\u2019He got his name because he killed a thousand people. It was said that he was an enemy to at least a thousand people.\u2018If you think about their family and friends\u2026\u2019That number would grow exponentially. The immature, young Veratoux was always under threat. It was also a Veratoux\u2019s job to overcome that danger!\u2018No one has actually been assassinated.\u2019It was also said that everyone in Veratoux had overcome the danger on their own.\u201cViola!\u201dIn Vixen\u2019s case, who was running over there waving his hand, \u2018Hey! All the weak will die!\u2019 he must have swung his sword innocently.Chaeng!The blade and the blade collided.Tundra pierced the sword, blocking the dagger held in Vixen\u2019s hand.\u201cSheesh. Is it you again?\u201dVixen retrieved the dagger in his hand as if it were a pity.Viola felt it\u2026 She would have died many times without Tundra, though she said it outwardly coldly.\u201cIf you want to kill me, step on my dog \u200b\u200bfirst.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dSeeing Vixen nodding his head, Viola let out a sigh.Is it a bad or a good thing?\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a mission, I would have gone with Viola.\u201dAfter saying that, Vixen waved his hand again and walked away. He ran very fast, but dust flew behind Vixen.She fell into doubt.\u2018You must be busy with your mission, so why did you come?\u2019If you ran that fast, your stamina would be severely drained. It meant that there was a reason for him to move quickly at the expense of stamina.It was said that he was very busy, but why did he have to come all the way here and take a stab at it?\u2018Do I look like I want to get stabbed that much?\u2019She didn\u2019t think her brother would have come to just see her.Viola just before departure.As if thinking about it, she turned the horse\u2019s head back to the Duke\u2019s castle.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cI remember something I left behind.\u201d\u201cShall I bring it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dXenon couldn\u2019t bring it since what she left behind wasn\u2019t a thing, it was a person.\u2018Because it seems like there will be many raids\u2026\u2019After hearing Xenon\u2019s words, she became anxious. So, Viola decided to take Hickson\u2014from Hickson to Xenon to Tundra.This should give her peace of mind.\u201cHuh? Me? I\u2019m a little\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dHickson hesitated, then opened his mouth with difficulty. \u201cWhen I was young, I was a little beat up.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dHickson then scratched the back of the head with that big hand.\u201cI confessed to my first love.\u201d\u201cWas it a life-and-death matter?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cSo, not even a life-and-death matter, but confess to the person you like.\u201d\u201cI was young then.\u201dHe continued to avoid Viola\u2019s gaze. He couldn\u2019t lie, and honestly, he was ashamed as an adult to say this.\u201cDid you apologize?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s, too much time has passed, a little, that\u2019s, so\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t apologize.\u201dHickson was sweating profusely.It had been more than twenty years already. Wouldn\u2019t it be more embarrassing if he pretended to know about it now?\u201cIf you remember the person who beat you this much, it will remain as a bruise on the person who was hit\u2019s chest.\u201d\u201cAh, how can a guy be like that?\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s a man or a woman, it hurts when you get hit.\u201dHickson touched his cheek, and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cThe name that is engraved in your heart doesn\u2019t get better no matter how much time you put on it. It\u2019s the same with you.\u201dHickson wasn\u2019t confident in meeting Viola\u2019s eyes.He actually knew it, too, because there was a big bruise on Hickson\u2019s chest.Although he pretended to be okay, he was not okay at all. No matter how much time passed, his daughter\u2019s face became more and more distinct.\u201cSo, sincerely apologize. I\u2019ll give you that chance.\u201dEventually, Hickson decided to move on as well.Three days passed.Xenon tilted her head, wiping away the bloody dagger.\u201cI think the frequency of raids is much higher than usual.\u201dHickson agreed.\u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve been trained.\u201dThere were seven raids in three days.It was the second day they entered the mountain range, so in effect, there were seven raids in two days.\u201cBy the way, it\u2019s definitely not just bandits like that. Viola. Did you go somewhere and kill people without me knowing?\u201d\u201cNo, I never did.\u201dViola thought. \u2018If it\u2019s Xenon, he might know the reason.\u2019He knew, still, he may not tell her to silently verify her qualifications as a Veratoux.\u2018Then I\u2026 I have to tell you the answer.\u2019As her thoughts went so far, new possibilities began to appear.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone didn\u2019t want Veratoux\u2019s envoy, Viola, to arrive at Viscounty Seal.\u2018Moderately trained raiders.\u2019They were not highly trained.It meant that they didn\u2019t want to use such high-level manpower, and they didn\u2019t want to reveal his tail.\u2018They don\u2019t like the reconciliation between Veratoux and Seal, and an unknown force that doesn\u2019t send high-quality manpower to this side.\u2019There was one such evil force.In the novel, they called themselves \u2018hot air.\u2019They were also the ones who kidnapped Hickson\u2019s daughter and Jermi.\u2018Of course, Jeremy, who was full of curiosity, was kidnapped half-voluntarily, but\u2026\u2019It was described in the novel like this:[ \u201cJermi, who was very curious, accepted the kidnapping.\u201d ]Who would have known that curiosity would turn the Veratoux and the Palail family to such an extreme?After all, they want to isolate Winter Castle and Veratoux. That\u2019s why they broke Hickson, Heron\u2019s trusted comrade in the past.\u2018They didn\u2019t send high-level personnel to this side, but instead, they would send high-level personnel to Viscounty Seal\u2019s side.\u2019She thought she knew what they were thinking.\u2018By the time we arrive, they will kill all the people of Viscounty Seal.\u2019And, they would put it on Viola herself.The \u2018hot air\u2019 would be the ones who will remain.\u201cBy the time we arrive. At that time, they will try to kill all the people of Viscounty Seal.\u201d\u201cEh? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re blocking us by sending people of similar skill seven times. They\u2019re calculated our arrival times.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere are forces that want Veratoux to be isolated.\u201dHickson actively agreed with that statement.\u201cThere are a lot of people who want Veratoux to be destroyed. So are you sure this is a trick?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s correct to count the time. The question is, can they annihilate Viscounty Seal at exactly that time? It\u2019s going to be physically difficult? Killing all those people isn\u2019t a matter of just a minute or two. If we arrive in the meantime and get some evidence, they will be in trouble.\u201dXenon gazed at Viola softly. He was quick-witted and seemed to understand why Viola was saying this.\u2018She\u2019s saying this to listen to her.\u2019Xenon felt a little better.When Viola chose to be a white Veratoux two years ago, Xenon was frankly embarrassed. The person who suits the black more than anyone chooses the white.But now, he thought a little differently.\u2018It\u2019s very different from the white Veratoux I\u2019ve been, through.\u2019The result itself was different from the successors of the past who had no choice, though to choose a white Veratoux because they could not become a black Veratoux. Her ability as a black Veratoux was superior to anyone else, although her ability as a white Veratoux was even better than that.Now, it was showing it without filtering.Xenon asked, \u201cThen they\u2019ll use some other way to get the time right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me what the method is?\u201d\u201cTimed poison.\u201dThere were several poisons with concepts similar to modern time bombs. After a certain amount of time, the poison suddenly spread and killed people.\u201cAmong these, there are three main types of poison for which no evidence remains: seven-syllable poison, degeneration poison, and three-day poison.\u201dXenon quietly nodded his head, and Hickson looked up at Viola with his eyes wide open.\u201cWhen did you study that again?\u201dVeratoux\u2019s successors do not study poison directly.Instead of studying poison and finding a way to destroy it, they infuse poison into their body to develop resistance to poison.There was no need to fear poison, no need to study. The successors of Veratoux wielded the sword more than studying poison.\u201cWhen did you learn poison?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a white Veratoux. You have to study hard.\u201dThe poison mainly used by the \u2018frenzy wind? Hot wind? Fervor wind? \uc5f4\ud48d(\u71b1\u98a8\u2019 in the future is a low-level poison.\u2018The Poison Witch uses it a lot later.\u2019The Poison Witch Sersilka.There were two great villains in this novel, except for Viola, and she was one of them.It was a character that occupied a fairly large proportion, and accordingly, there was a fairly detailed explanation in the novel.\u201cOh, dear. Really. The more I look at her, the more amazing she is. So? What kind of poison do you think they will use?\u201cThe seven-syllable poison is not effective because it can only be used in cold regions or in winter.\u201d\u201cThen, what\u2019s the degradation poison?\u201d\u201cDegradation poison is too expensive to be used for Viscounty level.\u201dExpensive means that the material was rare, and if they found enough to annihilate Viscounty Seal\u2019s family, the tail would be revealed.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be pursued.\u201dAlready Hickson and the Storm Sword Jackal are looking with their eyes lit up.They were hiding more and more in the shade. So, they wouldn\u2019t do anything that deserved to be pursued.\u201cIn the end, the only thing they can use is the three days\u2019 paradise poison.\u201d\u201cWhat else is that? It\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\u201cFor three days you feel good and fuzzy. And after three days you\u2019re going to sleep and die.\u201d\u201cIs there such a poison?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s easy to make and the effect is certain. The price is cheap, and there\u2019s not much evidence left.\u201d\u201cIs it the perfect poison?\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s not like that.\u201dViola turned her gaze to Xenon and opened her mouth.\u201cDoes Xenon know why?\u201d\u201cYeah, I know.\u201dHe took a deep breath and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely effective and cheap, but it\u2019s so easy to detox.\u201dIt would take three days for it to take effect. If you felt abnormal for three days, you could detoxify it. It was valued as a poison was very low.\u201cSo, it\u2019s just a hallucinogenic drug. It\u2019s not uncommon for it to be used.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for the timing at the same time. Right now, Viscounty Seal must be very busy.Veratoux\u2019s special envoy, also the Princess was coming down directly. Besides, Viscount Seal and Viscountess Seal must be out of their mind because of the shock of losing their son.\u201cSo, the best is to use the three days paradise poison?\u201d\u201cExcept for a few quick-witted knights, I\u2019ll use it on the rest. And, just before we get there, they\u2019ll stab them as they die. It\u2019s a way to minimize the time it takes to commit a crime. Good timing.\u201d\u201cTo put it back on us?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dViola pointed to Tundra.\u201cTundra. Run without rest from now on. Go alone to Viscounty Seal.\u201dWhen Tundra arrived, it was one step late.\u2018You\u2019re right, Master.\u2019He secretly infiltrated Viscount Seal\u2019s private house. Most of the family members of Viscount Seal were addicted to poison.\u2018There were a few that are fine.\u2019Rather, they were like the axis of evil.He remembered Viola\u2019s words.\u2018There will be normal people. Be suspicious of them and beware. There\u2019s a good chance they are the criminal.\u2019Viola was right, s sharp airway was felt.\u2018Is the number about eight?\u2019Tundra faithfully fulfilled Viola\u2019s words.He took advantage of the darkness to launch a surprise attack. He killed four people who were sleeping together.\u2018It was easy because it was a surprise attack.\u2019Now, they, too, must have noticed the strange air current.\u2018Now\u2026!\u2019He attacked a man who was on patrol, but it was a trap.They stabbed him in the shoulder. Nevertheless, Tundra struck his opponent\u2019s neck in that state. He gave his shoulder and got poisoned.\u2018This is difficult.\u2019There were still three left. He had to deal with everything to make Viola easier.That night\u2026In the end, Tundra faithfully fulfilled Viola\u2019s orders.\u2018Heuk\u2026Heuk\u2026.!\u2019He, who completed his mission, was also not normal. It was because he overworked to execute Viola\u2019s words.\u2018I\u2019m a little dizzy.\u2019He shed too much blood.Nonetheless, Tundra found Viscount Seal in a poisoned state.\u201cViscount.\u201dSomeone tossed and turned in the thick blanket.He said, \u201cShut up. Who are you this late night?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dViola taught him.\u2018If it\u2019s the real Viscount Seal, of course, he\u2019ll wake up.\u2019\u2018Though if it\u2019s fake, he\u2019ll hide his face and tell you to get lost.\u2019She taught her another important fact.\u2018Never let your guard around. When you turn around, he\u2019ll attack you from behind.\u2019\u2018Then what should I do?\u2019\u2018Answer that you know and pretend to back away and surprise him first.\u2019Tundra remembered that and answered.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dHe pretended to turn around. Then, he tried to surprise the man, but it was difficult.\u2018His body is not normal.\u2019If it had been normal, he would have attacked the man right away, although there was nothing he could do.Someone jumped out of the blanket.Of course, it wasn\u2019t the Viscount Seal.The tip of the sword touched Tundra\u2019s neck.Tuk!As that person fell to the ground, Tundra thrust a sword into the back of the person who had fallen.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who can use poison.\u201dIt was different from the original story.The original Tundra didn\u2019t use poison. He was a character with a set-point to wield a destructive sword that revered supremacy.Later, he learned poison and poison acupuncture.\u2018To be with the Master\u2026 For the happiness of the Master, I will not choose any means.\u2019If it was to become strong by himself, he would not have learned it.However, the situation is different from the original. He didn\u2019t want to be strong to stand alone, he had to be strong to achieve his grand dreams.\u201c\u2026Because I am the master\u2019s dog.\u201dSo. he had to do his best, and the current Tundra was more desperate than the original Tundra.He got more and more dizzy because his body was bleeding too much.\u2018Dizzy.\u2019Nevertheless, the mission had to be completed to the end. He stuck a poison needle in his forearm.\u2018Do it till the end\u2026\u2019It was a poison needle with a temporary awakening effect.His unconscious thought, \u2018For my master.\u2019Tundra, gushing in blood, walked up to the wall and swung his sword. The wall collapsed with a creaking sound, and behind him was Viscount Seal, bound to a chair.\u201cIt\u2019s just as the Princess said.\u201dViola taught him.\u2018Viscount Seal is a hard-hearted person, so he would recognize the three-day paradise poison. He must have detoxified it in advance and must have been tied up and locked up somewhere.\u2019Heeup! Hup!Viscount Seal struggled.\u201cThe Princess will arrive in a few hours.\u201dTundra freed Viscount Seal.\u2018Mission. Completed.\u2019At that moment,\u00a0Bump!\u00a0He fell down on the spot. His face had turned white because he had spilled so much blood, but Tundra\u2019s expression looked very happy.He gazed into the air with unfocused eyes.\u2018I hope you come and praise me.\u2019He did not miss his mission until the very end.\u201cLemon and vinegar. And, make an antidote by mixing medium or higher Alminu powder in aratio of 1:1:1. You are addicted\u2026\u201dMoments later, he lost his consciousness.A few hours later.Viola, Hickson, and Xenon had arrived at Viscounty Seal.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The memories of Han Arin, which had been buried beyond her memory, rose to the surface and soared.\u2018Calm down!\u2019\u2018Emergency! It\u2019s an emergency!\u2019\u2018Move away!\u2019Kang Han-jun had a car accident\u2026Han Arin, who had promised to meet Kang Han-jun, immediately rushed to the hospital. She saw the bloody Kang Han-jun.Kang Han-jun couldn\u2019t open his eyes.That scene at that time was so vividly etched in her mind no matter how much time passed. No matter how many times she turned away from it, it came up like a nightmare and tormented Han Arin.At that time, Kang Han-jun was unconscious, and he only made a strange new voice as if he was in pain.A groan was still heard.\u201cUmmm\u2026\u201dTuk!It felt like something was breaking in Viola\u2019s head.\u201cIs it you?\u201dShe walked to Viscount Seal, who was kneeling on his knees.Hickson felt something strange and tried to catch Viola, though Xenon stopped him. He shook his head and spoke only with the shape of his mouth.\u2018The Princess must be thinking about everything.\u2019Hickson\u2019s eyes turned to Viola.Intense murderous energy came out that for ordinary people, it was hard to breathe. That was definitely the energy of a born killer.Viscount Seal let out a small moan.\u201cUgh\u2014\u201dBlood gushed out of Viscount Seal\u2019s right ear.Everything happened in the blink of an eye.Viola\u2019s hands were fast and cruel.\u201cDid you, dare, make my dog \u200b\u200blike this?\u201dViscount Seal maintained his undisturbed posture, except for a brief trembling. He answered, keeping his composure.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cEverything the Princess had prepared came true, and the companion sword was seriously injured while dealing with the enemies.\u201dEventually, Viola came to her senses.She lost her mind when she saw the bloody Tundra.\u2018No. This can\u2019t\u2026\u2019It hid behind \u2018Viola\u2019s Ego\u2019 that had been buried deep in her consciousness.Viola bit her lip.\u2018But, not like this.\u2019Watching the Viscount flowing with blood, she captured her mind.\u2018I was the one who made Tundra like that.\u2019Even though she foresaw most of the situation and went with it, Viola didn\u2019t know that Tundra would get hurt so badly.It was Viola herself who gave the order, and it was she who injured Tundra.\u2018Sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019She thought it was too easy. Because Tundra was the male lead, she thought he could overcome any difficulties very easily.Thinking that way was the problem.Nevertheless, she couldn\u2019t express her thoughts outwardly. She then admitted her mistake in front of the Viscount, and then took responsibility for making his ears that way.\u2018Sorry.\u2019Fortunately, even if it was cut, it will be able to recover quickly because the splicing magic of attaching things is very well developed.The rage was urgently put out for now.\u201cIf my dog \u200b\u200bdoes not recover, the Viscounty Seal will be annihilated today, Viscount.\u201dViola and her party moved to the reception room under the guidance of the chief attendant. A few refreshments and tea were served, but Viola refused to eat.\u201cI will draft some reports to send to the Duke. Princess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXenon took out a notepad and pen from his pocket.After writing something down, he asked Viola.\u201cMay I ask why you cut off the Viscount\u2019s ear?\u201dXenon looked forward to that.Whether the picture Viola Veratoux is drawing matches the picture he was thinking of, he wanted to check it out.\u201cWhy are you asking that question?\u201d\u201cThe Princess must have already known that Tundra would suffer that much.\u201dNo.She did not know.It was because Viola was so focused on the setting of the male lead, she didn\u2019t expect Tundra to get hurt this much.\u201cYou did all this to save the Viscounty. You must have been well aware that it wasn\u2019t the Viscount who caused the damage to Tundra. Still, was there any need to make the Viscount\u2019s ears like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe was silent for a moment.\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019She had been dispatched as a special envoy, and the act of cutting off the Viscount\u2019s ear was rash. Viola, a white Veratoux, spoke as if nothing had happened.\u201cA warning about making me work hard.\u201dXenon\u2019s pen was busy scribbling something down.\u201cWarning!\u201dXenon sighed a little.What he was thinking was right. It made him feel better, as Viola and he seemed to agree.\u201cThen, the Princess has made the grace of life shine for them, and has even established order as a Veratoux.\u201dShe must not lose her prestige as a Veratoux.However, she couldn\u2019t just blindly punish the Viscount. So, she purposely saved a life. Once she saved his life, she had a justification for having his ears cut off.Hickson snorted.\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\u201cThen, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cViola is angry. About Tundra being hurt.\u201d\u201cThe Princess is understanding the situation most rationally. And she is solving the situation in the most efficient way.\u201dWell, that\u2019s unknown since that was not it.The Viola that Hickson saw was a little different. As soon as she saw Tundra, Viola lost her temper a bit.\u2018You like him, kid.\u2019He only knew that her flesh and blood were made of iron. Though to be angry like this is quite human\u2026Xenon didn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201cSir Hickson is not wise. The Princess has taken all the practical benefits through thorough calculations.\u201d\u201cTes. Let\u2019s do it like that. Whatever it is, Viscount Seal must\u2019ve gone stiff. He must be thinking a lot by now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dIn Hickson\u2019s eyes, the Viola was not normal now.There was deep-seated anxiety in her eyes. He was worried about Viola, but he also felt good about it.\u2018The anxiety in Viola\u2019s eyes\u2026 Xenon can\u2019t read Xenon! Hahahaha!\u2019Only he was able to read it.It was probably because he\u2019d lost the most precious person in the world. So, he and Viola are closer.\u2018I know Viola much better! I! I am closer to Viola!\u2019Viola was now acting in the mask of a white Veratoux.She pretended to be cool. She pretended to be rational in every situation, even though now, her mind seemed to be all directed towards Tundra.With that thought, he decided to help.\u2018Didn\u2019t I say I\u2019d be your adult?\u2019The way Xenon wanted more, he decided to help Viola by leading the conversation in the way he wanted Xenon to report.\u201cHow would it feel in Viscount Seal\u2019s perspective? To have his life spared and suddenly his ear was cut off. It\u2019s obvious that the Viscount can\u2019t have beaten Tundra. Is it strange no matter how you think about it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSeal is a pretty smart guy. He\u2019s confident and smart, so he\u2019s annoying.\u201dSo, he hit him a lot in his childhood.Hickson didn\u2019t like that upright, straight personality.\u201cIt\u2019s strange, so I\u2019m going to wrap my head around it and think about it. Why did Viola act so contradictory?\u201d\u201cFrom the perspective of Viscount Seal, it would be like that.He looked at Viola with a squint.Although she acted like she was okay on the outside, Viola looked like she was about to collapse right now.\u2018Yes.\u2019Who would have thought that the iron-blooded Veratoux would have something like that?\u2018Why are you so unusual? I want to protect you.\u2019He was blatantly speaking.\u201cOne person did two contradictory actions together. Would that be impossible unless there were two egos?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen the Viscount Seal will interpret it like this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHickson continued.Knock, knock.A knock was heard.The chief attendant sent a report to Viscount Seal.\u201cI showed them to the reception room and prepared hot tea and refreshments. How are your ears?\u201d\u201cThe cut surface is so clean that it can be recovered in one day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Did Princess Viola take care of you?\u201d\u201cPerhaps. I didn\u2019t know she could be this talented at twelve.\u201d\u201cIs it like that?\u201d\u201cThe priest was surprised. She even expressed the ability to rival that of Princess Medea when she was young. So, that\u2019s why she must have been sent as a special envoy.\u201dThe chief attendant was an employee of Viscount Seal, but he was also an old friend.He asked cautiously, \u201cWhy would she do that to the Viscount? She must know the situation better than anyone.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s giving me a message.\u201d\u201cA message?\u201d\u201cSomeone in Veratoux wants to warn me.\u201dThat someone is probably Duke Heron.Viscount Seal decided so. He seemed to want to warn him not to be foolish, and if he had a strange heart, he would kill Viscount Seal right away.\u201cSo Viola Veratoux, a special envoy, spoke on behalf of Veratoux\u2019s position and warned me harshly. My ears really hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThough I think the human Viola Veratoux wanted to be considerate of me.\u201dIt seemed that this had created this situation.A way of giving a warning after saving a life first, making a cause.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too much?\u201d\u201cViola\u2019s already making a name for herself as the iron-blooded Veratoux. Besides, she\u2019s been on her way as the white Veratoux from two years ago.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the white Veratoux\u2026? The eliminated Veratoux?\u201d\u201cIt was originally.\u201dTherefore, the white Veratoux should show even greater performance.\u201cThe Princess who has turned herself into a white Veratoux. All of this must be a rational plan in her head.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026 the Princess is only twelve years old.\u201d\u201cPrincess Medea became the youngest Level Nine Knight at the age of twelve. She subjugated the goblins by herself. Does that make sense?\u201dThat, too, was absurd.\u201cAnyway, the princess successfully carried out Veratoux\u2019s warning. The thousand-kill Duke doesn\u2019t like me, but the Iron-Blood Princess will definitely like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe chief attendant trusts Viscount Seal, but he was also a little worried. In fact, now, Viscount Seal and Veratoux were not in a peaceful relationship.Veratoux were the enemies of the family who killed the eldest son of Viscount Seal.\u201cViola Veratoux will approach me in a cunning tug of war between the Veratoux Viola and the human Viola.\u201d\u201cIs she going to use us for her own sake?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, she is.\u201d\u201cIt feels a little\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, we\u2019ll have to watch.\u201dViscount Seal looked towards the bed.\u201cIf it was the princess\u2019s wit and resourcefulness, she would have noticed earlier that the life of the companion sword was not in jeopardy.\u201dAlthough he was unconscious from bleeding a lot, it was an injury that would recover sooner or later.Viola, who must have noticed that, had said this.\u2018If my dog \u200b\u200bdoes not recover, the Viscounty Seal will be wiped out today, Viscount.\u2019\u201cPrincess Viola will come back to visit me before today is over. Her companion sword is recovering, so we\u2019ll start talking.\u201d\u201c..Was that the message?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola will come again\u2026\u201cAnd, she\u2019ll say what she really wants to say. The human Viola could possibly approach me in a more humane way.\u201d\u201cMore humane way?\u201d\u201cSomething like an apology for killing my son.\u201d\u201cAp, apology? Veratoux?\u201dThe chief attendant thought that was never going to happen. And in fact, killing the son wasn\u2019t a matter that ended with an apology either.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t even know.\u201dApologizing is not the only issue. One of them will have to die to solve itOf course, it would be on their side to die.\u201cBecause of that, I\u2019m going to watch it for a while. It\u2019s so weird I think I\u2019ll have to watch it.\u201dIron-Blooded Veratoux.He couldn\u2019t figure out what Princess Viola Veratoux was thinking. It was possible to interpret Viola\u2019s actions, but it was difficult to predict.\u2018The Princess already has a wider field of view than me when she is only twelve.\u2019What will she really say?He decided to wait and see how she would solve the situation.\u201cReally\u2026 will Princess Viola come to visit tonight?\u201dThere was an unwritten rule among the nobles not to seek each other after 10 pm.It\u2019s already past ten o\u2019clock.\u201cShe will.\u201dIt was eleven o\u2019clock at night.\u201cIt\u2019s eleven o\u2019clock\u2026 will she really come?\u201d\u201cShe will come.\u201dAround that time, Tundra came to his senses.Knock, knock.Just then, a knock was heard.It was Viola.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, he ran silently to the door and grabbed the door.\u201cWelcome, Princess.\u201dAs Viola passed by Delpha, his body trembled.It has been over twenty-five years since he worked as an attendant. In the meantime, he has met numerous nobles and knights. So, he prided himself on being quite familiar with people with \u2018magic.\u2019\u2018My body is trembling\u2026\u2019Viola seemed to have a special magic.It was because even if he just brushed past her and got goosebumps.\u2018This\u2026 Is the rumored Kill Star?\u2019It was difficult for him to look straight at the twelve-year-old girl. This sticky murderous energy made him keep forgetting that Princess Viola was only twelve years old.The visible Viola was a young girl of twelve years old, and the Viola he felt was a giant.Meanwhile,Viola was in a good mood.\u2018They say Tundra is fine.\u2019As if they had changed the bedding to something clean, a pure white duvet caught her eye. Tundra was asleep softly. They don\u2019t know how relieved she was to hear that Tundra was fine.\u201cI can do what I have to do.\u201dShe didn\u2019t dare hide what she felt good about. Thinking so, she smiled lightly and walked towards Viscount Seal.The chief attendant Delpha swallowed his saliva.\u2018She\u2019s smiling\u2026?\u2019In Delpha\u2019s eyes, it felt like a witch\u2019s fishy smile. It had nothing to do with Viola\u2019s actual expression.The person in Delpha\u2019s eyes was a smiling witch.It didn\u2019t seem right to say that the thousand-kill Duke had brought in a witch.\u201cExcuse me for being late.\u201dViola walked over and stood in front of Viscount Seal.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cYou must know what\u2019s going on.\u201dIn fact, she was in a slightly different state from her usual. Unlike usual, she was not cool and did not observe the situation rationally.\u2018Is Uncle Hickson that smart?\u2019However, Hickson told a lot about her by talking to Xenon, and Viola was acting accordingly. It was only when he told her did Viola finally notice the situation.So, Hickson was a big help.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t notice my intentions at all, Viscount Seal.\u201dHearin so, Delpha swallowed his saliva once more. He recalled the conversation with the Viscount earlier.\u2018Isn\u2019t everything the Viscount said right?\u2019All of what Viscount Seal had guessed seemed to be correct. Up until now, he thought she was a twelve-year-old kid, but now, he had completely changed my mind.\u2018If it\u2019s that Princess, she could do that.\u2019Viola sat cross-legged on the table chair.\u201cChief attendant.\u201d\u201cYes, Princess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like some warm milk, please.\u201dAt the word of the request, Delpha\u2019s ears twitched.\u2018\u2026Please?\u2019It was a word that didn\u2019t quite fit the current Viola. Because it was not a command, it was a request.Isn\u2019t that a very kind command again\u2026?\u2018However\u2026 strangely\u2026\u2019The word \u2018please\u2019 was natural even though she must have been a princess who was much more familiar with orders than requests.\u2018So natural, so more\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t know how to express this feeling right now.Afraid\u2026? Unfamiliar? Weird?\u2018No. It is dominating\u2026\u2019That polite tone and requesting attitude seemed elegant and natural. It felt like she was one of the heirs of the ruling family.A single word of request had such a strong power.\u201cAdd honey.\u201d\u201c\u2026Understood.\u201dViola, who felt better, pushed a little more.\u201cCookies, too.\u201d\u201cYes. I will prepare it.\u201dAs he went outside, Delpha felt a strange feeling. She had the perfect atmosphere for a ruler, but milk with honey and cookies?The gap came to him strangely.Eventually, Viscount Seal opened his mouth, \u201cFortunately, it seems that the companion sword will be able to recover soon.\u201d\u201cI heard.\u201d\u201cAnd, my ears are said to recover within a day or so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u201d\u201cIt is said that the cut surface is so clean.\u201dThe Viscount\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what the Princess intended?\u201dShe was not like that, but the other her inside is like that. It wasn\u2019t her intention, although that\u2019s how it happened, anyway.Viola said quietly, hiding her inner feelings.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t my intention, would I have used force there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it is. Then I\u2019ll tell you with the assumption that all my predictions are correct.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the princess Viola, the human Miss Viola, came to apologize to me?\u201dViola grinned.The acting had also come to an end.\u201cApologize?\u201dIn an instant, the Viscount\u2019s body trembled. Without realizing it, he almost met the weapon.\u2018What momentum\u2026!\u2019Even seeing the First Princess Medea as a child wasn\u2019t like this. She felt much more cruel and serious than Medea\u2019s magic.Still, at the immediate moment, he had a terrible feeling that she would pull out her dagger and pierce his throat.\u201cI judged the Viscount to be a reasonable person with upright convictions. That\u2019s why I came this far by calling myself a special envoy.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for looking at me like that.\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s a little disappointing. I didn\u2019t know you were going to discuss the apology first.\u201dThe Viscount\u2019s face hardened slightly. After all, the Veratoux are the enemies of the family that killed the Viscount\u2019s son.The Viscount was planning to go to war.Viola\u2019s question followed before the Viscount responded.\u201cWas your son important to Veratoux?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cThen why did we have to put the child to death while taking the blame and ignoring the formal procedure?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that because\u2026 my son broke the stern laws of the Winter Castle?\u201d\u201cAh. He dared to break the law of the winter castle as a son of a Viscount. Did we kill him because we were offended?\u201dSaying so, Viola grinned.Viscount Seal\u2019s heart was boiling with anger. Right or wrong, the Princess was clearly laughing at his side.With that thought, the Viscount\u2019s voice rose a little.\u201cSo, it isn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dMeanwhile, the chief attendant came in with honey milk and coconut cookies.\u2018Wow!\u2019Viola put the coconut cookies in her mouth and groaned.\u2018It\u2019s delicious.\u2019After all, the nobles of this world have a knack for baking. The cookies were very satisfying.Meanwhile, the Viscount opened his mouth.\u201cI was going to declare war.\u201d\u201cI know. The Viscount is such a person. Of course, the person who would die will be you.\u201d\u201cBecause I am prepared for death, I must hear a clear explanation.\u201dThe Viscount was not afraid of death.\u201cIf there is no clear explanation, I will declare war on Veratoux even now. If you hadn\u2019t saved my life once, I might have killed you on the spot.\u201d\u201cIs it possible?\u201d\u201cI do not know.\u201dHe saw the Princess\u2019s movement earlier, and itt was absolutely not the movement of a twelve-year-old.\u201cHowever, now, all of the Viscount\u2019s personnel have been freed from poison. If our knights move, it is presumed that it will be possible to capture the Princess and the party.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s say that\u2019s it. Nevertheless, I hope that you don\u2019t commit any unfortunate incidents that will actually happen. Please. Seriously.\u201dTo be honest, she was terrified.\u2018Please\u2026\u2019To be honest, she really meant what she said.\u2018Uhh. I\u2019m scared.\u2019No matter how much she lived as Viola for five years, she lived as Han Arin for twenty-one years. She\u2019d be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t afraid.In Korea, there was no such situation.\u2018Still\u2026 Much better than dealing with father.\u2019She consciously decided to eat more comfortably.\u201cThe reason why an unimportant person was executed without formal procedures is simple when you think about it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Please answer.\u201d\u201cBecause my father likes the Viscount.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a complete lie.Even in the original work, Heron praises the Viscount. So, he was considerate to end his life by hanging rather than beheading. After that, ironically, he even sponsors Viscounty Seal.\u201cWhat, what is that\u2026!\u201d\u201cIn order to protect the honor of the Viscount, it means that father took on the stigma of a tyrant.\u201dViscount Seal had a confused expression on his face.\u201cWhat does that have to do with my honor?\u201d\u201cIt was just an excuse to break the law of the winter castle.\u201dViola tapped her hand lightly and uttered.\u201cXenon.\u201d\u201cYes, Princess.\u201dAs if waiting in advance, Xenon immediately opened the door and entered. He held a white cloth in his hand, and a glass bottle of red liquid was placed on it.\u201cIt\u2019s your son\u2019s blood. He was addicted to black magic.\u201dViola spoke with a calm expression.\u201cIf he was sane, would he have caused such a riot at Winter Castle? Only because of egg tarts?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dBlack magic blinded people\u2019s minds and made them crave for instinctive pleasures. Instead of making emotion take precedence over reason, he could get powerful magical powers.Of course, there was one major side effect.If they don\u2019t manage their magic properly, their body will explode, like turning into a living bomb.\u201cSomeone injected black magic into your son\u2019s body. But as you know, it cannot be activated without the son\u2019s consent. After all, black magic is what the son wanted. There was a lot of black magic dissolved in his blood.\u201dThese contents appeared in the Viscount\u2019s setting book, though it had not been dealt with in-depth in this chapter.Zelton was just a supporting actor in the unfortunate fate of being killed by Vixen.\u201cThe concentration is very high, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange if he exploded at any time if left alone. First, I had to protect the people of Winter Castle from your son who became a living bomb.\u201dViola\u2019s eyes turned to Viscount Seal.There was a small amount of white milk froth around her lips.\u201cSecondly, I had to protect the honor of the Viscount. So, I just put him to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cUntil your son reached that point, what was the Viscount doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy did my father have to defend your honor while wearing the dirty stigma of being a tyrant?\u201d\u2018Actually, my favorite character is not like that!\u2019Although a little scary, he was a good person who raised cute hedgehogs in the coffin of the beast with seven stacks of magic circles!\u201cIf I were father, I would have exposed everything to the world regardless of the Viscount\u2019s honor. If he had done so, the Viscount would have committed suicide. He is a man of upright conviction.\u201dIt was the same in the original story.In the end, the Viscount starts a war, and Heron kills the Viscount himself.\u2026For his honor.The fact that Zelton was addicted to black magic will be forever buried in the world.\u201cI ask. Was my father\u2019s choice wrong?\u201dThe Viscount lowered his head. Then, he began to bring out the words that even Viola could not have thought of.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was my father\u2019s choice wrong?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201dThe Viscount, who had spoken up to that point, remained silent for a long time, then opened his mouth with difficulty.\u201c\u2026Actually, I knew.\u201dThen, he covered his face and sobbed.At that moment, Viola felt that Viscount Seal\u2019s body had become much smaller.He was withdrawn and humbled. The \u2018nobleman who had an upright conviction to the point of death\u2019 mentioned in the novel was not here.\u2018Did you know?\u2019She didn\u2019t expect it.She didn\u2019t know that he had noticed his son\u2019s derailment because it was never mentioned in the novel.\u2018Zelton is killed by Vixen, Viscount Seal is killed by Heron.\u2019That was the content of the novel.\u2018Did he pretend he didn\u2019t know at all even though you knew it?\u2019Viola looked at Viscount Seal, sobbing silently. As she continued to stare at him, she seemed to understand.\u2018He wanted to be the father-Viscount, rather than the noble-Viscount.\u2019The father did not want to reveal the fact that his son had derailed. It seemed he didn\u2019t want it to be revealed to the world that his son had sold himself to black magic.\u2018He, who was a father, disregarded even his own convictions and could not punish his son.\u2019Because of that, he decided not to judge right or wrong.\u2026Zelton was already dead.In other words, Seal paid for the sin by losing his son.\u201cFor whatever reason, Zelton had a father.\u201dThe weeping Viscount Seal looked at Viola. It was because her words were surprising.\u2018\u2026Had a father.\u2019It was also the words the Viscount Seal wanted to hear.\u201cHe always wanted to be a tree to that child.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe wanted to be a strong protector.\u201dSo, he poured a lot of love and affection toward his son.\u201cIt is a noble thing for a father to love his son.\u201dViola seriously thought so.Some said it is natural for parents to love their children. However, Han Arin, abandoned by her parents, did not think so.For her, it was not natural.Everyone knows it\u2019s natural, but Han Arin didn\u2019t have that for granted.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong.\u201d\u201cThe method may have been slightly wrong, but it cannot be denied that the Viscount\u2019s heart was sublime.\u201dHearing that, she bit her lip slightly.Even if it was a false fatherhood, the Viscount\u2019s love was real.\u2018I am not a judge.\u2019She didn\u2019t want to judge right or wrong. Because of that, Viola decided not to judge the heart of a father who had already lost a beloved son and was sobbing.\u2018He lost his dearest son, and that must have been the punishment he deserved.\u2019She already thought she didn\u2019t need to push all those who had paid for it.\u201cThank you for your warm words.\u201dAfter a while, the Viscount took out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes. His eyes were red and bloodshot.\u201cLord Zelton must have always been strong, so he could have had the guts in the winter castle.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t have been just a side effect of black magic.Zelton trusted his father. Maybe, it was because he turned out in a bad way, but his belief in his father itself was clear.\u201cThe Viscount was a dependable father.\u201dShe wished she had a father like that.Her father said he would come to find her after sleeping a hundred nights, but he never came back.\u201cI will not judge the Viscount.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cEven though I don\u2019t agree with the method, I agree with you. The Viscount may not have been a great father, but I think you are right that you were a warm father.\u201dShe then moved closer to the Viscount.Viola stretched out her hand toward the Viscount, who looked infinitely small, whose secrets were discovered.The Viscount placed his hand on top of her as if possessed by something. Her hand was very small, but it didn\u2019t feel small.Viola\u2019s presence was felt very greatly.\u201cThis is from Veratoux\u2019s envoy, Viola Veratoux. Veratoux will not hold the Zelton\u2019s black magic and Viscount Seal responsible for neglecting it, because the Viscount has already received the greatest and most painful punishment.\u201dAt that, the Viscount knelt down on one of his knees.She was a princess who was speaking as a special envoy. These words were also the words that Veratoux conveyed to Seal.He had to be polite.\u201cI. Viola Veratoux understands the noble heart of a father and the choices as a father. That\u2019s why I also ask Viscount Seal.\u201dViola bent her knees. Now, she was at eye level with Viscount Seal.\u201cWould you mind understanding my father\u2019s point of view?\u201dViscount Seal\u2019s body flinched.Viola continued to speak.\u201cMy father also has a father\u2019s position. My father is the great monarch over the winter castle, the first shield to protect mankind from \u2018the snowy place,\u2019 and the head of Veratoux. Though before that, he is the human Heron, father of several brothers and sisters, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, my father wanted to protect the honor of Zelton and his father.\u201d\u201cDid the Duke say that?\u201d\u201cMy father doesn\u2019t say it himself, because the moment you say it, the Viscount\u2019s honor will plummet to the ground. Everything I say is my own thoughts.\u201dShe thought back at the novel and the author\u2019s setting book.Viola hadn\u2019t heard it from her father, but it\u2019s probably right. After all, the author was the creator of this world.\u201cSo, the decision is entirely up to the Viscount.\u201dEventually, she got her body up and slowly pulled her hand away.\u201cIf you accept my request as a special envoy, friendly relations will be established between Veratoux and Seal. If not, we will become enemies. Seal can declare war on Veratoux.\u201dInstead, she promised one thing.\u201cEven if war is declared, the Viscount\u2019s honor will be protected.\u201dHeron Veratoux would do that. Even though Seal was killed, he would have preserved their honor by exalting the spirit that had brought him to war with Veratoux.With that thought, Xenon laughed secretly.\u2018There is absolutely no way out.\u2019In fact, Viscount Seal had no choice at all. From the moment Viscount Seal confessed that \u2018I already knew,\u2019 the victory belonged to Viola. Although in the form of a request, her words were a notice.\u2018On the surface, it seems that Viscount Seal was given a choice, but in fact, the choice lies with Veratoux.\u2019Viscount Seal fell on his knees.He cried in that position for a long time.It was tears of remorse\u2026Tears of self-reflection that the wrong father\u2019s love had ruined his son.\u201cThank you for opening my closed eyes again, Princess Viola Veratoux.\u201dHis heart ached. No matter how well she packaged it, the sadness of losing a son was indescribable. And, the thought that this was his own fault made Viscount Seal even more tormented.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dHe told Viola, who was not Princess Veratoux.\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u2018Thank you for telling me I was a warm father.\u2019Though those words did not come out.Two days passed.Xenon formally wrote the report.\u201cI plan to post a simple report using magic communication. I will go back and post the official report myself, Princess.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me every single thing. You do your job.\u201d\u201cI still want to look good to the princess?\u201d Xenon said, smiling.\u201cSo. Did you like Xenon?\u201d\u201cHow dare I judge it?\u201d\u201cJudge.\u201dAt that, his smile widened even more.\u201cThere will be no more beautiful results.\u201dWithout losing Veratoux\u2019s authority and honor, Viscount Seal made himself admit his mistake, and on the contrary, Viscount Seal said he would apologize.As the smile still lingered on his face, he continued.\u201cI was truly impressed with the princess\u2019 mask.\u201d\u201cMask?\u201d\u201cYes. The Princess seems to have magic to move people\u2019s hearts. It\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s a noble fatherhood.\u201dXenon, of course, thought it was a mask. No matter how sublime it is, if it is wrong, it is no longer sublime.\u2018If it was the princess I had been so far, he would have thought so.\u2019If it was Princess Veratoux, yes.That was the famous iron-blooded Veratoux. A person who acts on the basis of rational reason and judgment.\u2018She is well aware of how she can thoroughly fool and capture your opponent.\u2019Such information was included in the report.\u201cThe report. Shall I show you?\u201d\u201cIs that report for me?\u201dViola didn\u2019t completely believe in Xenon. Even in the original story, he was the one who tested her until the end\u2026 With such a nice face and smile.\u2018If I ask you to show it to me, you will be disappointed.\u2019Xenon answered, \u201cThe report is for the Duke.\u201d\u201cThen, you do your job.\u201d\u201cI want to show you\u2026\u201dHowever, his words were sincere. It wasn\u2019t like a test for the viola. To be precise, Xenon did not fully understand his feelings.\u2018I\u2026 Right now, do I want to be praised\u2026?\u2019This report was well written, so please look and praise.That was what he was feeling.Still, Xenon himself didn\u2019t know exactly why he was feeling that way.That night.He sent the report using a magic communicator.[ Based on a cool-headed reason, it is judged that she has the ability to convince others by touching their emotions.The opposite side of humanity. In other words, it is possible to thoroughly play the \u2018human figure who is very empathetic, warm, and can speak words of comfort.\u2019Therefore, Princess Viola Veratoux perfectly proved her ability as a white Veratoux to be very outstanding. ]An explanation was added there.[ Looking at her daring and ability to cut off the Viscount\u2019s ear, it is judged that she is also very talented as a black Veratoux. Of course, it was a deliberate act made with thorough calculations as a white Veratoux.Both her black and white Veratoux abilities are excellent.I am making it clear, that this is the personal opinion of the butler, Xenon. ]As he gazed out the window after sending the report,\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019But, he had a strange feeling.\u2018What?\u2019\u2026Below.He could feel an energy, but at least, it wasn\u2019t the energy of Viscount Seal. This energy was obviously from a trained person.\u2018Who?\u2019The energy was heading towards Viola\u2019s bedroom.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was because he didn\u2019t feel any murderous energy at all.\u2018Those who have mastered the storm sword have difficulty in hiding because of their overwhelming energy.\u2019So, it was unreasonable to kill.There was no grudge between Stormhold and Viscount Seal.\u2018Then, the reason he came here is probably because of the Princess.\u2019Xenon grinned as he thought.\u2018I should prepare tea.\u2019Shall he add some poison?He pondered for a while but decided not to put it. Meanwhile, Viola was startled by the face she saw out the window.\u201cLord Jermi?\u201dShe checked again, but the window was clear.\u2018Is this the seventh floor?\u2019Viola\u2019s room was located on the seventh floor. Even though there was a way to fly using magic, that was about wizards. However, Jermi was a swordsman.\u2018\u2026What the hell?\u2019Through the window, she could see him smiling broadly.He seemed to be saying, \u2018Hurry up, open it!\u2019As she eventually opened the window, Jermi jumped into the room.\u201cWow. It was fun.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dIt was best to maintain an ambivalent relationship with him that was neither too far nor too close. With that thought, Viola judged that and actually acted that way.\u2018Rope\u2026?\u2019A rope was hung from Jermi\u2019s waist.It looked like he went up to the roof and came down with a rope.\u201cWhat do you think? Are you happy?\u201d\u201cThere was no official message.\u201d\u201cCan we meet only if there is a message between friends?\u201d\u201cWere we friends? And, it\u2019s eleven o\u2019clock at night.\u201d\u201cIs it that time already?\u201dJermi made an \u2018uwaak!\u2019 look after hearing her words. It wasn\u2019t acting, it was sincerity. He really didn\u2019t know it was so late.\u201cI thought it was around nine o\u2019clock.\u201dHe smiled awkwardly as he lifted the rope around his waist.\u201cI\u2019m concentrating on preparing for this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen did you get on the roof?\u201dHe waved it left and right with his index finger.\u201cGet on? I infiltrated. Getting on is different from infiltration. There was a lot of tension.\u201d\u201c..Yes. Infiltrate.\u201dHe said that he had arrived on the roof at six pm. Then, he spent an hour thinking about how to make a cute appearance, hid again for two hours to find the rope, and an hour and a half to infiltrate the roof again with the rope\u2026\u2026And, so on.\u201cWhat are you doing this for? You should just contact Viscounty and come in through the front door confidently.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise visit.\u201d\u201cYou know that this is a very problematic action diplomatically, right?\u201dIn some cases, it would not be strange to be treated as an assassin, and even if it wasn\u2019t. It was obviously rude.\u201cIt\u2019s okay because Storm Fortress is politically and diplomatically independent.\u201d\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll probably be fine. Hee hee hee. My father is probably going to get mad.\u201dJermi explained why he was here. He mentioned that he was planning to visit one of the nice historical sites in the vicinity, though he heard that Viola was visiting Viscounty Seal.\u201cI wanted to see my friend\u2019s face and say hello. So, I came here.\u201d\u201cThen, why not from the front door\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, the historical site is a secret. I\u2019m coming to tell you a secret, but I can\u2019t come here confidently. Rumors shouldn\u2019t spread. Be careful is my motto.\u201dIs such a human being kidnapped out of curiosity?Viola wanted to argue, but she decided not to because it was clear that a very common-sense and logical conversation would not work.\u201cWhat kind of historical site is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about the exact name, it\u2019s just called some mad wizard\u2019s lab.\u201d\u201cWhy do you tell me if it\u2019s a secret?\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re friends.\u201dSmall storm Jermi\u2019s expression was flawless. It was so transparent that there was not even a hint of malice or disrespectful intent.He sighed and opened his mouth again.\u201cPrincess Viola.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cActually, am I bothering you?\u201d\u201cWas it obvious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious.\u201d\u201cWell, would you please step back now? I\u2019m at the age to enter the social world soon, and I don\u2019t want to be a party with unwanted rumors. Even if the other person is Jermi. It\u2019s the worst.\u201dJermi lightly scratched the back of his head.\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAbsolutely the worst.Jermi, who was famous for being the small storm and a fine person, had an overwhelming fan base in the novel, and the author described it as feeling like the \u2018first-generation idols\u2019 that existed in the novel.It meant that he had, or will have malicious fans.So, it would be very, very, very tiring to get entangled.\u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that. I\u2019m just glad to meet you.\u201dHearing her words, he became pale.\u2018Was it too bad?\u2019Thinking so, Viola added a few other words.\u201cI was glad, too.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dViola put on her social mask. Even though she didn\u2019t want to be friends with Jermi, she didn\u2019t really want him to turn his back on her. She responded in moderation and gave a good smile.Finally, Viola and Jermi headed towards the door.In the meantime, he did not rest his mouth for a moment.\u201cYou know what?\u201d\u201cIs it necessary?\u201d\u201cPrincess Viola is much cuter than I thought.\u201dEspecially, when eating egg tarts\u2026!Of course, he didn\u2019t say that.\u201cYou have a special taste.\u201dViola was very knowledgeable about her own looks. Right after she took possession, the most she did was look in the mirror and look at her face.\u2018There\u2019s not a handful of cuteness on this body.\u2019She wished she was cute.Like many romance-fantasy that Han Ah Rin has encountered, it would be great if she was like a cute princess and was a loved character.Just in time, Viola saw herself reflected in the mirror on the wall.\u2018\u2026It\u2019s not cute at all.\u2019She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t pretty, but being pretty and being cute were two different things. Even if she gave her eyes a little bit of power, it would become like murderous energy, and indeed, it was a genius body that was born for murder.\u201cIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s cute.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s do something cute.\u201d\u201cHonestly, you hear a lot of people say that you look like an old child, right?\u201d\u201cI hear it often.\u201dHickson even went as far as to ask her if she only looked young.It was Viola who opened the door.\u201cCome on. The door is this way.\u201dOutside the door stood Tundra. His face was very dark.A few hours ago.Tundra came to his senses. There was only one thought that came to my mind as soon as he woke up.\u2018I want to see her.\u2019Is this what a dog\u2019s heart is like? Is this what a dog waiting for its owner who went out like? He felt that way.\u2018Why do I want to see her?\u2019Being a dog was a dream, but he was not a dog. It was difficult to give a rational explanation for \u2018Why do I want to see Viola?\u2019\u2018The reason is\u2026\u2019Tundra got up from the bed.There was aching all over the body, but it was not very difficult to move.\u2018The reason is that\u2014\u2019In the novel, Tundra, set as a rational male lead, could find a reasonable reason.\u2018I want to be praised.\u2019When Viola stroked his hair, it felt like his heart was pounding. However, it wasn\u2019t just about feeling good. He felt something much deeper than that. For Tundra itself, it was a mysterious and complex emotion that was difficult to define.\u2018Praise. I want to get it.\u2019He got up and went out into the hallway.\u2018Master\u2026\u2019Tundra smelled the surrounding magic.Viola was born with \u2018murder star,\u2019 and the place where she stayed or passed by had a characteristic scent of magic , like the scent of blood.In his eyes, it seemed like a road.\u2018It\u2019s over there.\u2019As he stood in front of the door where Viola was staying, he hesitated for a moment in front of the door.\u2018Will she praise me\u2026?\u2019He guessed it was too late now. Well, is it all right to find his master at such an hour?The rational male lead also attached a reasonable reason.\u201cBecause I am a dog.\u201dThe dog was going to meet the owner, and there was no way to set the time.A dog was a dog.Not a person.He didn\u2019t think it was necessary to be bound by human etiquette. Even Viola had told him to act like a dog. So, he couldn\u2019t stand the longing to see her and the desire to be praised by her.However, a voice came from inside.\u201cPrincess Viola is much cuter than I thought.\u201d\u201cYou have a special taste.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s cute.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s do something cute.\u201d\u201cHonestly, you hear a lot of people say you look like an old child, right?\u201d\u201cI hear it often.\u201dViola\u2019s voice was much higher in tone than usual. She had a much brighter voice than she was speaking to him.\u2018Master\u2026?\u2019It was clearly a male voice.\u2018This voice\u2026 It\u2019s Jermi\u2019s voice.\u2019Realizing that, he clenched her fists unknowingly. Tundra had many conflicts before coming here, and said he came to Viola because \u2018I am a dog.\u2019He wanted to be praised.He wanted Viola to stroke his hair.\u2018\u2026Jermi is a person, unlike me. He also knows the laws of the nobility.\u2019He didn\u2019t know why, but he was angry. For a brief moment, Tundra had to control the boiling rage.\u2018Whoo\u2014\u2019As he took a deep breath, he felt better.Being rational, he also had to find his reason again.\u2018The nobleman Lord disregarded etiquette and sought my master. At this late, midnight hour.\u2019He was angry because of such a rude act.Tundra thought so.\u2018But\u2026\u2019The master\u2019s voice didn\u2019t seem to be angry. The master was not angry, so there was no reason to get angry at him.\u2018Therefore, I cannot be angry.\u2019If he thought about it rationally, it certainly was. He cannot be angry, nor will he be angry. There was no justification, and there was no reason to convince the other person.\u2018By the way, why am I angry?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even know why he was so upset that Jermi had come to Viola and chatted with her alone. And, he gave up thinking any further.Viola taught her.\u2018People have to think deeply. Dogs don\u2019t have to think deeply.\u2019And so, he just decided to admit it. Even though he didn\u2019t know exactly why he was very upset.But then, the door opened and Viola\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cTundra? What brings you here?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m here to report that mission accomplished.\u201dJermi waved his hand.\u201cOh? Tundra. Hello? Glad to meet you. Jermi. We met before, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not glad to meet you. Besides, are we comfortable enough to talk casually?\u201d\u201cI thought so.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dAt his blunt reply, Jermi scratched the back of his head as if embarrassed.Tundra looked away from him and continued.\u201cI\u2019ve done my job perfectly, and I\u2019m here to get praised.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola gazed at Tundra.His shoulders and lips were trembling.\u2018When he was angry, he did just that.\u201dKang Han-jun never showed his anger. At least, he wasn\u2019t angry in front of Han Arin. Nevertheless, Han Arin could always recognize that Kang HanJun was angry.Because he always had his shoulders and lips twitch when he got angry.\u201cI\u2019ll praise you. Come here.\u201dTundra came closer and knelt down on one of his knees. Then, Viola put her hand on his head and he slowly stroked his hair.\u201cIs this what you want?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTundra\u2019s mind relaxed a little.Not a little, but right away.The anger melted away like snow. He wondered if this could be the heart of a puppy who was just happy at the touch of a guardian.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dViola frowned.\u201cYou\u2026 Why are you angry?\u201dAt her question, his body flinched. He thought he didn\u2019t show it at all, so he didn\u2019t know how she noticed.\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hear that you\u2019re sorry. I\u2019m asking why you\u2019re angry.\u201dViola was already feeling strange.\u201c\u2026. \u201cIn fact, Tundra never expressed any anger.He just tossed it away that he was angry, and he just said sorry. However, he seemed to admit that he was angry.\u2018Why are you getting angry in the same way as Brother Hanjun\u2026?\u2019It confuses her in many ways.\u2018He\u2019s not Kang Hanjun, but acts like Kang Hanjun, and has the same habits as Kang Hanjun\u2026\u2019\u201cI asked. Why are you angry?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you angry?\u201dTundra did not answer for a moment and then eventually opened his mouth.\u201cBecause Lord Jermi disregarded procedures and laws and acted contrary to the manners of the nobility.\u201d\u201cHey, you\u2019re lying.\u201dJermi giggled and laughed as his eyes painted a half-moon.\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201dTundra made eye contact with Jermi.Their eyes collided in mid-air.\u201cDid you say jealousy?\u201d\u201cYes. Jealousy.\u201dTundra tried to say, \u2018Don\u2019t say nonsense with your tongue,\u2019 but couldn\u2019t.\u2018\u2026Jealousy.\u2019It seemed that what Jermi said was right. After making a rational decision, Tundra nodded. He had to admit what he had to admit.\u201cYou seem jealous.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe moment Viola calmed her mind.\u2018Brother Hanjun wasn\u2019t jealous of me.\u2019Kang Han-jun always treated Han Arin as his family. He was always warm and caring, but he never treated Arin as a woman. Even if there was jealousy, Han Arin did it, Kang Hanjun never did.\u2018I feel rather comfortable.\u201dThere was a difference between Kang Han-jun and Tundra. If it was Kang Hanjun, he wouldn\u2019t have said it was jealousy.\u201cDo you know about my wish, Lord Jermi?\u201d\u201cYes. Dog. It was an interesting dream. But, is it real?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTundra was desperate for a dream of being a dog.So, whenever he had time, he studied hard about \u2018dogs.\u2019 He met and talked with dog owners several times, and also met with dog trainers, an emerging occupation that has recently emerged, and received counseling.\u201cSome dogs are temperamental and show considerable obsession and jealousy towards their owners.\u201d\u201cHooo\u2014\u201d\u201cI can control it to some extent with training, etc., but I\u2019ve never had that kind of training. That\u2019s why I\u2019m jealous.\u201dViola wanted to say, \u2018That\u2019s a real dog thing! You are a person. And, Jermi, why are you suddenly so convinced?!\u2019 thought she stopped herself.\u201cSo, you were jealous?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201dHe bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Princess. I dared to be jealous.\u201dJermi giggled and laughed as if it was funny.\u201cYou talked like a real dog?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s my dream to be a dog.\u201dEven though the content of the words was absurd and funny, the attitude itself was more than serious and even reverent.However, Jermi was also serious.\u201cI like people who have faith.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause I think the value of belief is something that no one else can appreciate.\u201dHe then tapped Tundra\u2019s shoulder.At first glance, it seemed encouraging.\u201cI support your dreams and beliefs.\u201dViola trembled for a moment. It was because it was a phrase that appeared several times in the novel.[ \u201cI support your dreams and beliefs.\u201d ]Nevertheless, it was never meant to be literal!That was how it was expressed in the novel.\u201cThat was also what Jermi usually said when he felt a strong competition.\u201dViola felt like crying a little. In which part of Tundra\u2019s beliefs that he felt a strong competiton?\u2018\u2026Where the hell?\u2019Even Arin Han, who was a genuine reader, was an unpredictable character.The author wrote on their blog, \u2018Actually, I think he\u2019s a character who doesn\u2019t know where he was going. When he came to his senses, he just knew that he was running wild.\u2019 And, even left a review saying, \u2018I think that\u2019s what the character Jermi is like.\u2019As a prime example, Jermi was a character who is kidnapped because of his curiosity.Jermi walked out.\u201cAnyway, we\u2019re going to explore the historical site together. See you in three days.\u201dThen, he looked closely at Viola and Tundra and grinned.It was completely intentional.\u201cBecause I\u2019m older, I\u2019ll speak casually to you. See you in three days, cute Viola.\u201dThree words landed in Tundra\u2019s ear.Brother.Casual.Cute.Without anyone knowing, Tundra raised his lips and growled low.Viola felt sorry for Tundra.He was like a baby puppy that had been hit by the rain.\u201cWere you too embarrassed as a dog?\u201dHe looked like he was shivering in the rain, drooping his tail and shivering.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be jealous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dViola was actually feeling pretty good because she recognized that Tundra had a markedly different aspect from Kang Han-jun.\u201cThe dog behaved like a dog. What are you sorry about?\u201dShe gently rubbed Tundra back.It was like a master stroking a dog\u2019s back.Then, Tundra immediately felt better.If he had a tail, it would already be swaying. Until recently, he had a face that looked like he was about to shed tears, though now, he had a face that looked like he had the whole world.\u2018Like a real dog.\u2019Eventually, Tundra regained his peace.Meanwhile, Xenon came into Viola\u2019s room and asked, \u201cBy the way, Tundra. How did you know that Lord Jermi was here?\u201dViola tilted her head.\u201cDid Tundra know that?\u201d\u201cYes. I stood in front of the door for a long time. I think I realized that Sir Jermi was there.\u201dViola shifted her gaze towards Tundra.\u201cDid you know?\u201d\u201cYes. I knew.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cThe smell.\u201dFor a moment, Tundra\u2019s nose wrinkled. His noses twitched like when puppies sensed any smell.Hearing his answer, Xenon smiled.\u201cYou recognized the Master by the smell? Do you mean the body odor?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cIt has a characteristic smell of magic.\u201dViola doubted her own ears.\u2018A distinctive smell of magic?\u2019Viola was a reader who binge-read the social \u3008 Shadow of Bellatu \u3009 several times, and even read the author\u2019s setting book several times. However, the word \u2018characteristic smell of magic does not appear.It was the same in the novel as well as in the setting book.\u201cEach person has a different smell. I felt Jermie\u2019s smell.\u201d\u201cI see. It\u2019s a strange phenomenon.\u201dIt was not mentioned at all in the novel.Apparently, the male lead Tundra had a new ability that was not found in the novel.\u2018Will it be okay\u2026?\u2019Xenon asked again.\u201cDo I smell like that, too?\u201d\u201cYes. But your smell changes every day. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause it felt insensitive and cunning.\u201d\u201cAh. The evaluation is poor. Still, since we\u2019ve been together for five years, isn\u2019t the evaluation that much?\u201dTundra nodded relentlessly.Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsite\u201cI was hurt.\u201dXenon claimed to have been wounded with an uninjured expression on his face, and Tundra didn\u2019t really care.\u201cThen, what kind of smell does the Princess have?\u201d\u201cNostalgic smell.\u201dTundra\u2019s words were unstoppable. He said \u2018nostalgic smell\u2019 without even a second\u2019s hesitation.\u201cI\u2019ve known Master\u2019s scent for a very, very long time.\u201d\u201cA very, very long time ago? How long?\u201dXenon\u2019s smile widened.\u201cI met Princess Viola five years ago.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been wanting to smell Princess Princess\u2019s scent for a long time.\u201dAs she heard his words, Viola frowned slightly. She didn\u2019t know what the hell he was talking about.\u201cWhat nonsense?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense.\u201dNonetheless, Tundra\u2019s expression was serious.It didn\u2019t seem like a lie.\u2018Why is he making strange noises again?\u2019When she stared at Tundra, she kept getting confused. With the same face and same voice as Kang Han-jun, he kept making strange noises.\u201cWhat is that, If not nonsense?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve known the master smell since I first started feeling her. I\u2019ve known the master\u2019s smell for a long time. It\u2019s the first time I smelled it, but I\u2019m used to it and I miss it.\u201dTundra was honest with his own feelings and thoughts.\u2018Dogs don\u2019t have to think deeply.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what a human Tundra would be like, but Tundra thought it was okay to be honest. After all, it was Viola who told him to do that.\u201cIt felt as if the thread of an old bond was touching.\u201dA faint smile appeared on Tundra\u2019s face.\u201cSomehow, I think I lived to meet the master. The smell tells me that.\u201dThat night.Viola stayed up all night with open eyes. She kept pondering over Tundra\u2019s words.\u2018Nostalgic smell. Old reationship.\u2019And, one more word\u2026\u2018Somehow, I think I lived to meet the Master. The smell tells me that.\u2019The moment she heard those words, her heart ached for some reason.She buried her face in the duvet.\u2018Why are you saying that with that face\u2026!\u2019It must have been a strange feeling.She was well aware that Tundra did not lie. Although It wasn\u2019t meant to be said, Tundra was just an honest person expressing his sincerity and feelings. So, it was even more confusing.\u2018Tundra is just as faithful as a dog.\u2019He said he had studied a lot about dogs.As he studied very hard, he must have been imitating the dog\u2019s behavior without realizing it.\u2018They said dogs don\u2019t betray people.\u2019She was told that they looked only at their master for the rest of their life and lived only for them. It had been said that for a dog, the Master was everything in the world. Because of that, Viola thought that Tundra was also in the process of making himself that way.\u2018Yes. Tundra is such a character.\u2019He was a character who always did what he set his mind to. So, if he says that a \u2018dog\u2019 is his dream, he had the setting to do his best to make that dream come true.\u2018Hence, a new ability that didn\u2019t exist in the original was created.\u2019Furthermore\u2026\u2018You must have missed the smell of my magic for a long time and felt it was a familiar scent.\u2019The character Tundra was a character that would create such a situation.Viola had to be so convinced.\u2018Ah. My head hurts.\u2019Suddenly, the bright morning sun penetrated through the windows. There was the sound of chirping bluebirds.\u2018I must have fallen asleep without realizing it.\u2019At that moment, Xenon was standing in front of the bed and waiting.\u201cYou kicked the blanket with your feet again today.\u201d\u201cWhen did you come?\u201d\u201cI arrived two hours twenty-five minutes eight seconds ago. My job includes taking care of the princess\u2019s health, so I put the blanket back on.\u201dSaying so, he grinned.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a stomachache.\u201dWould this body have something like a stomachache?Viola was about to speak.There was no need for her to appear ignoring Xenon\u2019s sincerity for nothing as Tundra was faithful to the role of Tundra. Xenon was only faithful to Xenon\u2019s role, too.\u201cWhat about the promise to the Viscountess?\u201d\u201cIn two hours. We have agreed to have breakfast together in the Sunrise Hall.\u201d\u201cYes. Even Viscount Seal knows nothing about the contents, right?\u201d\u201cYes. He only knows it as a social gathering place for the Princess and the Viscountess.\u201dLast night,Viola wrote a secret letter to Viscountess Elail.[ I know you have a child in your womb. So I\u2019d love to talk to you. ]Thanks to this, breakfast was prepared.Xenon said, a little excited, \u201cThe dress code for the Sunrise Hall is yellow.\u201dXenon opened the subspace and took out a whopping thirty-eight yellow dresses. The dresses that were spread out with magic were so gorgeous that it hurt the eyes just looking at them.\u2018Isn\u2019t there anything more simple and neat?\u201dWhat was that big ribbon in the center of the stomach, what was that excessive chiffon lace, and what was that luxury embroidered with gold thread\u2026?It has been five years since she possessed this world, though the fashion still didn\u2019t fit her.\u201cI\u2019ll do it with this.\u201dIt was a relatively short dress made of yellow silk. It wasn\u2019t too clingy to the body, and it wasn\u2019t too bland, so it didn\u2019t seem like it would be too difficult to move.\u201cWith this?\u201dXenon looked a little sad.\u201cHow about this?\u201dWhat he pointed to was a layered dress with a lot of gorgeous lace and sparkling ornaments.There was great anticipation in Xenon\u2019s eyes. It was as if the joy of someone who had first encountered playing with dolls was buried in his eyes.\u201cXenon. You still don\u2019t know my taste?\u201d\u201cI know, but\u2026\u201dHe then gently bowed his back.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was too greedy.\u201dHis tone was polite and warm, but Viola felt somehow ominous. She didn\u2019t question what kind of greed had preceded him.\u2018Xenon\u2026 I think I have opened your eyes to a new world.\u201dAfter many twists and turns, it was nine am and Viola was escorted by Xenon and headed for the sunrise hall.The door to the Sunrise Hall opened.She could see a rectangular dining table that wasn\u2019t that long. It was large enough to seat eight people.The feast had already been set there.\u201cPrincess Viola. Welcome.\u201dSomeone got up from their seat.A lady with voluminous brown hair.Her name was Elail, and she was the woman who would later become the mother of the Great Wizard Bengas.After greeting her lightly, Viola sat down.All attendants and butlers were dismissed.\u201cI want to dine alone with the Viscountess.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll leave now, Princess.\u201dBefore the meal proceeded, Madam Elail asked.\u201cPrincess Viola, how did you know that I had a child?\u201dIt was a fact that no one, not even her husband, the Viscount, had been informed. It was surprising in its own way for the Viscountess.But, more shocking words followed.\u201cDo you think that\u2019s all I know?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI also know that the child\u2019s father is not Viscount Seal.\u201dTuk!The fork in Viscountess Elail\u2019s hand fell to the ground.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The real viola didn\u2019t laugh, though she was smiling in the head of Viscountess Elail. She also had a very mischievous smile.\u2018You have to be calm.\u2019She hid her trembling hands and smiled lightly.\u201cI used to be clumsy like this. My husband even thinks it\u2019s lovely.\u201dIt was as if dropping the fork was nothing.The Viscountess wiped her lips with the napkin and opened her mouth again.\u201cI wondered why Princess Viola wanted a private meeting with me. Was it possible that the reason was so immature?\u201dIn Elail\u2019s mind, Viola was just Veratoux\u2019s \u2018Iron-Blood Princess.\u2019A cold-blooded and cruel princess of Veratoux, whose blood was made of iron. She was only twelve years old, and she was an undisputed genius who earned the name of Iron-Blood, and was a girl who was more \u2018Veratoux\u2019 than anyone else.\u2018You must never let your weakness get caught.\u2019Then, her life would be difficult\u2026She may live her whole life in fear.\u201cPrincess Viola is making a very big mistake with me now. Are you going to tarnish my honor?\u201dShe had to push harder. For Viscount Elail now, her best defense was an attack.\u201cI\u2019m going to make the issue public.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. This is more than insulting me, it\u2019s an act of mocking Viscounty Seal.\u201dViola pretended to be relaxed and sliced \u200b\u200bthe steak.She had been through a lot of this before. Dealing with her father, who was the King of this world, Viscountess Elail was relatively easy.\u201cI have a great dog.\u201d\u201cDog?\u201d\u201cThe world calls that dog a companion sword.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u2026Companion sword.It was a name Viscountess Elail knew.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the boy that the Iron-Blood Princess took over five years ago and is raising as a servant, and is known as Sir Hickson\u2019s only disciple?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Though why would I make a human a dog?\u201d\u201cIs that related to the topic now? I\u2019m talking about the princess who insulted and ridiculed Viscounty and me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because he has a great sense of smell.\u201dShe actually found out yesterday that he had that ability, but thanks to him she made this excuse possible.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the first time you\u2019ve heard of it. It\u2019s been a thorough secret.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in Princess Viola\u2019s secret. I don\u2019t want to know. Rather, I ask for an explanation for insulting me.\u201dViola shrugged her shoulders. Her appearance was very relaxed. On the other hand, Viscount Elail felt something ominous in that laid-back look.\u2018Does she really know something\u2026?\u2019Desperately pretending to be relaxed, her inner heart was burning. She had no idea that a twelve-year-old girl could have that level of freedom and pressure. Viscountess Elail thought the rumors about Viola Veratoux were somewhat exaggerated, though not at all.\u201cMy dog \u200b\u200bcan smell people. There is special magic with different smells in humans.\u201dViola chuckled.\u201cHowever, he said that Viscountess\u2019s body smelled of two people. I knew that she had conceived a child.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe Viscountess nodded her head.She decided to admit she was pregnant because she decided it didn\u2019t make sense to hide it anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I\u2019m pregnant. If that\u2019s the case, shouldn\u2019t it be right that the princess should have congratulated me rather than insulted me?\u201d\u201cBut, interestingly enough, he said it smells like someone else\u2019s?\u201dThis was a lie.She knew this because she was Han Ah Rin, who had read the novel.\u201cWhy does the child in the womb have the smell of another man?\u201d\u201cDo not mess up my mind with baseless slander.\u201dThe Viscountess stood up from her seat as if she had nothing more to hear.\u201cOur enjoyable meal will end here. I think we will see you next time at an unpleasant place and with an unsatisfied face.\u201d\u201cWhy does he feel a gentle magic from it?\u201dThe Viscountess\u2019s body, who had been walking back, stood still.\u201cThe baby\u2019s father must have had abundant magic. But, it doesn\u2019t seem like the magic of a warrior. It would not have been of a lower status. Shall we stop at this point?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDid he come down from the high mountain? He must have whispered about love with sweet and tender words.\u201dViola knew the name.The second son of the Louisbarten family, Cervon Louisbarten\u2026 From Mount Para, known for its ruggedness. The second son of the Louisbarten family located in Mount Para was her affair partner.Viscountess Elail almost collapsed because her legs lost strength.\u2018You know it all.\u2019What happened that night was a mistake. That night, the fireworks were beautiful, the moon in the sky was beautiful, and the smiles of the people were good. The wine was really sweet that day and the night breeze blew pleasantly.\u2018I\u2026 What should I say?\u2019Her brain turned white.Viola\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIt must have been a mistake.\u201dShe recited it as she sees it in the novel.\u201cThat night the fireworks must have been pretty. The moonlight must have been exceptionally blue.\u201d\u201c\u2026Stop.\u201d\u201cIt must have been nice to see people smiling.\u201d\u201cPlease stop it\u2026\u201d\u201cThe wine is especially sweet that day, and the night breeze blowing by the river\u2026\u201d\u201cStop\u2026!\u201dThe Viscountess covered her face.\u2018She knows everything. She really knows everything.\u2019The Iron-Blood Princess knew everything\u2026Knowing everything, she came here to grab and shake her weakness. She had the blood of the devil and the tongue of a viper.Her hands and feet were trembling.\u201cWhat the hell do you want from me? Why do you come and threaten me? What kind of grudge do you have between you and me?\u201dShe then sat down in her seat and began to sob.Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsite\u201c\u2026It was a mistake that day.\u201dIt was a mistake, she thought, and she didn\u2019t get caught by anyone. She returned to her daily routine and maintained her original position. While she vowed that she would never do the same again, Viscountess Elail swore she wouldn\u2019t act foolishly, and she reflected.\u201cEven if it\u2019s a mistake, it doesn\u2019t change that it\u2019s wrong. Viscount Seal was worthy of respect. He was honorable and upright.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe Viscountess also admitted it.She was born into a fallen aristocratic family and grew up to this extent. Even though she did not become a high-ranking aristocrat due to her birth limitations, Viscount Seal was one of the aristocrats with a solid foundation.Viscount Seal was wonderful as a man and also affectionate as her husband.\u2018I have only you, wife.\u2019\u2018I love you with all my heart.\u2019He always confessed his love to her with plain words without any rhetoric.He always stood firm by her side like a beautiful tree.The Viscount was always reliable and strong\u2026However, on the other hand, he was a little bit boring. So, that night, she was enchanted by an interesting person without realizing it.\u2018Tonight, I want to toast to Madam\u2019s eyes.\u2019\u2018Forget everything and enjoy watching the stars with me.\u2019Viola looked at the Viscountess with a desperate expression on her face.The seeds were sown. Now, it was time to harvest.\u201cI have no intention of threatening you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Lies.\u201d\u201cI swear by the name of Veratoux.\u201dThe Viscountess, sobbing at those words, raised her head and glanced at Viola.\u201cAre you swearing on Veratoux\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s forbidden. To swear an oath in Veratoux\u2019s name is only permitted to the head.\u201dViola shrugged her shoulders.\u201cSo, if the Viscountess opens her mouth, I\u2019ll be cut off from the nomination for succession at once. A frivolous mouth doesn\u2019t qualify as a successor.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe now have each other\u2019s weaknesses. Can you believe me now? I\u2019m sure the Viscountess will know better how important the position of Veratoux\u2019s successor is to me.\u201dOf course, it was a lie.She was not at all interested in the position of Veratoux\u2019s successor.The successor was Medea, Viola had already decided that in her mind. Though to Elail, Viola\u2019s words came to her quite convincingly.\u201cIf it\u2019s not a threat, what\u2019s the situation?\u201d\u201cI want to be friends with Viscountess.\u201d\u201c\u2026Friends?\u201d\u201cThat child in the womb has the talent to become a wizard. It\u2019s a tremendous talent.\u201dThat child was the one who would become the Great Warlock. He was also one of the main characters who tormented Veratoux and Viola at the end of the novel.She didn\u2019t want such a villain to be born.\u201cI need power. So, this is an investment for me.\u201d\u201cInvestment\u2026?\u201dViscountess Elail felt more at ease.Rather, this was much more relieving. The word \u2018investment for the future\u2019 touched her more than the abstract word \u2018friend.\u2019\u2018Princess Viola is an iron-blooded princess who will do anything for her purpose.\u2019So, she seemed to be talking like this now.Adopted daughter who cannot get help from her maternal family. While her abilities were outstanding on her own, she was at ease when she understood that the adopted daughter, who lacked external powers, was in the process of expanding her powers.\u201cTo be precise, I want to invest in the child in your womb. It would be great if it could help me when they grow up.\u201dViola stared at the Viscountess for a long moment before she opened her mouth.\u201cViscount Seal is a smart man.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDoes the Madam think so, too?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d\u201cThen, does he really know nothing?\u201dIn an instant, the Viscountess\u2019 body shuddered again. Her heart felt like it was pounding \u2018goong\u2014!\u2019\u201cI know. He truly loves the Viscountess.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWould such a person think of marching for the sake of his children\u2019s and family\u2019s honor even though he knew he was going to die? Leaving the one he loved the most in the world on the estate? Knowing how sad his wife would be?\u201dFor the reader, Han Arin, that was the part she felt sorry for.The Viscount had his own circumstances.He was a noble who values \u200b\u200bhonor, though he was not a man to decide to die over her beloved wife. Had he not known about his wife\u2019s affair, he might not have chosen death\u2026In other words, the Viscountess\u2019 affair caused the Viscount to commit suicide.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come as a special envoy, the Viscount would have gone to war against Veratoux. And, perhaps by now the Viscount is not of this world.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause in my opinion, he doesn\u2019t seem like the person who would choose his death, leaving only his wife.\u201dViola got up from her seat.\u201cThe choice is yours, Viscountess. I\u2019m a member of Veratoux. As a white Veratoux, I look at everything from an observer\u2019s point of view.\u201dSaying so, she walked towards the door.\u201cYour own fault can only be corrected by yourself. And, a nobleman is responsible for correcting their own faults.\u201dFinally, she added a word.\u201cI feel that Viscount Seal will forgive the Viscountess even if you have done something worse than an affair, because he loves you so much.\u201dAnd so, she closed the door and left.A day has passed since then, around 12:30 in the morning.Knock, knock.A knock was heard.\u201cPrincess Viola. Can we talk for a moment?\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t a typical visit. There was no official notice, and there was no talk beforehand. Besides, the time was 12:30.In general, it was a time when we did not meet.\u2018Viscount Seal\u2026?\u2019When she opened the door, she saw Viscount Seal with an emaciated face. In his right hand was a longsword.Though it was a little strange\u2026Blood was dripping from the sword.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, she didn\u2019t pay much attention to her own side.\u201cYou\u2019re not surprised.\u201d\u201cAny reason why I should be surprised?\u201dIn fact, Viola didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.As she was holding on to all the strings of reason, she spit out any words that came to mind. While remaining expressionless, she counted one elephant and two elephants.\u2018It\u2019s peaceful now, Viola.\u2019If she suddenly jumped out and cut off the Viscount\u2019s neck, she would be in trouble.\u2026For now, just be quiet.\u2018If there\u2019s a moment when I need you, I\u2019ll call you then, please\u2026\u2019As if Viola\u2019s wish had worked, her pounding heart had subsided.\u2018Whoa.\u2019Then a voice was heard.\u201c\u2026.I.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI wanted revenge on my wife.\u201dThe Viscount murmured softly as he watched the blade of his sword dripping with blood through his cold eyes. Around that time, Viola also started to get a little nervous.\u2018What is he saying now?\u2019He wanted revenge?So, he got revenge? Then, what was with the bloody sword now?\u2018No way\u2026\u2019It wouldn\u2019t be.The Viscount killed his cheating wife. He probably didn\u2019t do such a terrible thing\u2026?\u2018It won\u2019t be. According to the novel, it can\u2019t be.\u2019Doesn\u2019t the author\u2019s setting values \u200b\u200bhave a great influence in this world? It couldn\u2019t be, though, that blood dripping continuously was stuck in her eyes.\u2018Yes, it won\u2019t.\u2019Viola took a deep breath without anyone knowing. If it was not anyone else and it\u2019s Viscount Seal, there was no way that\u2019s the case.\u201cSo what kind of revenge did you want?\u201dViola smiled while hiding her trembling heart. Outwardly, she seemed relaxed and calm.\u201cMy revenge is\u2026\u201d\u201cWas your own death a punishment for the Viscountess?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe man didn\u2019t say anything for a moment.The little princess seemed to have read everything in his heart. He had a creepy feeling as if those pretty eyes were scouring his own heart.\u201cI knew because you lost your son. How painful it is to lose a loved one. That\u2019s why the Viscount may have chosen your own death.\u201dIt would have been complicated.He loved his wife though hated her, on the one hand, and wanted to forgive her\u2026 Nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t. So he would eventually go to war to defend the honor and be a fierce warrior.Viola, who was reading the novel, hit the nail correctly.\u201cWhether you really want revenge, seriously think about it.\u201dAt that point, the Viscount said nothing.Think seriously.Did he really want revenge? He hated his wife so much, so maybe he just wanted to die.\u201cYou look very confused.\u201dShe could see the tip of his sword trembling. Even the Viscount himself seemed unaware of his own feelings.So, she just told him.\u201cThe Viscount didn\u2019t want revenge on your wife, you wanted revenge on the Viscount himself.\u201d\u201c\u2026To me?\u201d\u201cIt must have been your fault, and that\u2019s why you blame yourself for your wife having an affair.\u201dIf only I had loved my wife a little more.If only I had made my wife a little more joyful.If only I had made my wife a little more happy.If only I had made my wife a little more fun.If only I had, my wife wouldn\u2019t have had an affair.Deep in the heart of Viscount Seal, such thoughts were located.\u201cThe Viscount\u2019s love wasn\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s not the Viscount\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dFor a moment, the Viscount\u2019s heart pounded \u2018goong\u2014!\u2019\u2018\u2026It\u2019s not the Viscount\u2019s fault.\u2019Maybe, Seal didn\u2019t know what he wanted to hear the most. So, because of that, Viola\u2019s words were a great comfort.\u201cIt was the Viscountess who made the mistake.\u201dThe fault was made by the Viscountess.She got drunk in the mood, and she committed what she shouldn\u2019t have done as a spouse.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that it is the Viscountess, not the Viscount, who has neglected the responsibilities and duties of marriage.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cNevertheless, you won\u2019t be able to punish her.\u201dSeal was such a character.A character who loves his wife so much that he committed suicide instead.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to kick her out.\u201dBecause\u2026\u201cBecause the Viscount loves your wife so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe Viscount dropped his sword.Blood dripped from the palm of his hand holding his sword. Judging by the fact that the bleeding had not yet stopped, it looked like a fairly deep wound.A few hours ago.The Viscount shouted,\u2018I can\u2019t forgive you\u2026!\u2019He knew it, but he couldn\u2019t stand it when he heard the confession himself. He lost his temper in an instant and cut the palm of his hand with the sword he was wearing around his waist.The Viscountess screamed, and she was lost.That was his revenge\u2026To hurt his own body.That was the greatest revenge a husband who still loved his wife could do.\u201cI told you everything as the Viscountess had guessed.\u201d\u201cWhy? I\u2019d rather not hear anything from my wife\u2019s mouth.\u201d\u201cYou have to face the truth to move forward.\u201dSaying so, Viola picked up the dropped sword. She held it with both hands and handed it back to the Viscount.\u201cI know you can\u2019t forgive her right now. It will take time.\u201dHe must have felt betrayed as much as he loved her.She understood his heart too well.\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. The Viscountess was at fault. The Viscountess, who had done her fault, confessed her fault to the Viscount, and she gathered her courage and begged forgiveness.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cNow, the choice is yours. Forgive or not.\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u201dHe accepted the sword that Viola gave him as his eyes met Viola\u2019s.Viola, who was only twelve years old, had strong energy in her eyes. She had a strong core that is not shaken by anything or something like a firm conviction.When he saw those eyes, he was relieved for nothing.\u201cI will forgive her.\u201dViola was right.To punish or drive away the wife, whom he loved too much\u2026\u201cI swear I will not divulge this dishonorable thing to the outside. Your honor will not be tarnished. In the name of Veratoux, I swear.\u201d\u201cDid you swear\u2026 in the name of Veratoux?\u201d\u201cYou have one weakness of mine.\u201dShe deliberately gave her weakness.It was a promise not to gossip.Viscount Seal was deeply moved by that promise. He didn\u2019t know why Viola did this.\u201cWhat do you want? Why are you doing this to me?\u201d\u201cI hope that the Viscount and the wife will go on a bright path.\u201dSo, it should be. That way, the child in the womb would grow up in a peaceful environment and become her insurance!She hid that dark secret.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of it, but I heard the Viscountess\u2019s child will excel in magical talents.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not sure. This is the realm of smell and sense.\u201dNo. She was sure.After all, it was mentioned that way in the novel. In fact, it appeared as a formidable enemy that threatened Bellatu.She also swallowed those words.\u201cOkay. You\u2019re going to invest\u2026in my wife\u2019s child. With uncertainty.\u201dThe Viscount hated the child.But, it was also, on the other hand, the child of his wife. Even though he couldn\u2019t love, he seemed to love\u2026Complex, subtle, unknown emotions dominated his body.\u201cMy name is Viola Veratoux.\u201dViola stood up from her seat and looked down at the half-kneeling Viscount. She now had to talk to her as a Vertaoux.\u201cI. Viola Veratoux wants to be the guardian of the newborn child.\u201dViola was lying flat on her bed.\u2018It\u2019s done\u2026!\u2019Everything she set out to do here has been accomplished.The war between Veratoux and Viscounty Seal was stopped, and the terrible situation was eliminated. Veratoux\u2019s dangerous foe, Bengas, would never be born, and she even got the position of guardian of Bengas.Even Viscount Seal said this.\u2018I will remember Princess Viola.\u2019Thanks to Viola\u2019s movement, the Viscountess confessed her guilt.\u2018It will take a bit of time, but the direction is right. I\u2019m sure we can go in the right direction.\u2019\u2018You just have to go in the right direction. As long as the direction is right, it\u2019s okay to go slowly.\u2019If you go in the right direction, even if it\u2019s a little slow, you\u2019ll end up on the right path.\u2018I think I will be able to maintain a close relationship with Viscounty Seal.\u2019Starting with Hickson, Jackal of Storm Fortress. And even Viscount Seal. It seemed that everything that could be achieved by coming here was accomplished.Xenon has been making strawberry ade.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t my skills improve these days?\u201d\u201cIt has grown.\u201d\u201cBy replacing the previously used paralyzing poison with a lethal poison, the taste is softer.\u201dKek!Viola almost spit out the strawberry ade.He changed the taste very subtly, and put lethal poison, not paralyzing poison\u2026!\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll raise the amount a little higher, Princess.\u201dXenon grinned. He seemed very happy. Moments later, he looked at Viola for a long time as if observing her.\u201cIt\u2019s a poison that can kill even an elephant, though the Princess doesn\u2019t mind.\u201dA day has passed.Viola\u2019s stomach was slightly upset because of the lethal poison.\u201cPfft! Viola of the world is a stomach ache.\u201dHickson giggled and laughed as if it was funny.\u201cIt\u2019s a stomach ache!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh my, oh my! Even Viola has a stomach ache! Are you like a child at times like this?\u201dXenon grinned.\u201cOur princess is also suffering from a stomach ache.\u201dHickson giggled for a while, then went out and came back covered in dirt. It was a strange herb that looked like a bellflower.\u201cIt is a medicine that neutralizes the poison you ate. It will relieve an upset stomach.\u201dXenon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the root of a thermophilic plant?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find and\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just picked it up on my way here.\u201dViola knew about thermophilic plants.Not only was it rare, but it was a plant that took heat from the people who collected it and caused death from hypothermia in an instant. Therefore, the thermophilic plant was also famous as a man-eating plant.There was absolutely no medicine that could treat it.\u201cCome on. I got rid of all the toxicity, so eat it.\u201dHickson put the root of the thermophilic herb into Viola\u2019s mouth with a rough hand.Viola frowned, \u201cIt tastes awful.\u201d\u201cUse things that are good for your body.\u201dAt Viola\u2019s sharp eyes, she could see Hickson\u2019s hand trembling lightly. Although he pretended to be okay, he must\u2019ve felt a little cold because of the heat he had lost while collecting the thermophilic plants.\u2018Should I pretend I don\u2019t know?\u2019She seemed embarrassed if she should pretend to know for nothing.\u201cNext time, bring me something delicious.\u201d\u201cAre you upset about what I brought to you?\u201dHickson acted bluntly, though only got up after confirming that Viola was getting better.\u201cUncle. Where are you going?\u201d\u201cTo apologize to the Viscount.\u201dWhen he was young, Hickson teased Seal a lot. He said he was about to ask for forgiveness for his immature behavior.\u201cKill your temper and sincerely ask for forgiveness until the other person accepts it.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an apology to try to put your mind at ease. It\u2019s an apology until the other person forgives me. Okay?\u201d\u201cOh, that old kid. I got it!\u201dHickson wiggled his hand in annoyance and walked away.That evening, there was an incident that caused a stir in the Viscounty.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that he was older, he wasn\u2019t used to apologizing.It was hard.\u201cIn the past\u2026 I hurt you a lot.\u201d\u201cI heard you became somewhat like a drunk dog.\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking about the past?\u201d\u201cAnd correct your words.\u201d Seal set down his cup of warm black tea. White steam rose from the cup. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hit me a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d He didn\u2019t know what else to say, so he promptly shut up.\u201cIt was a simple situation.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI judged that responding to violence with violence was not suitable for the dignity of the nobility.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s in the past, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cWhen you lost your daughter, I honestly thought it was justice.\u201dHickson frowned. He had come to apologize, but this felt like scratching an open wound. Maybe he should teach Seal a lesson. It\u2019d been a long time since his reputation was cemented, so he felt for a moment that it wouldn\u2019t matter if he acted like it.\u201cMy heart was so evil then too. So let\u2019s forgive each other.\u201d\u201cDo you even know what it means to forgive? I thought my ears would start bleeding because you always talk about honor and dignity.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make an agreement.\u201d Seal put out his right hand. \u201cI confess and apologize for having an evil heart. I ask for your forgiveness.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of any reason not to. All right then.\u201d\u201cAnyway, you accepted my apology. You can\u2019t take it back later.\u201dHickson held onto Seal\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your son.\u201dA strange consensus was formed between the two. One lost his beloved daughter, and another lost his beloved son.After shaking it three times, Seal let go of Hickson\u2019s hand. \u201cI have a question.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou claimed to be the guardian of Princess Viola, right?\u201dThere was a big smile on Hickson\u2019s face. He wagged his index finger. \u201cNo. Viola asked me to help her.\u201d\u201cPrincess Viola?\u201dThe princess in Seal\u2019s eyes was cool and reasonable. She didn\u2019t look like the type to reach out to someone for help.\u201cShe wants to have a good adult next to her. She said she needs guidance.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cThat she chose you as a good adult.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dIt was funny even to Hickson. What did Viola see that made her want his help? Why did she reach out to him?\u201cThe Princess Viola I know is the owner of a calm and thorough spirit.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s also what I think of her.\u201d\u201cPrincess Viola needed your help and at the same time recognized your need.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018my need\u2019?\u201d\u201cI guess she wanted to help you.\u201d\u201cViola wanted to help me?\u201dHickson was lost in thought for a moment. In hindsight, his life did change after meeting Viola.\u201cShe brought me back to life, from when I was living so pitifully.\u201dWas that the best way to describe it? Like some sort of salvation?\u201cI guess it\u2019s true that she helped me. But why is that?\u201d\u201cPrincess Viola is a Verratoux. I\u2019ve never seen a successor quite like her.\u201dThat was right. That\u2019s what Hickson thought too.\u201cShe seems to have immense wisdom.\u201dOtherwise, these situations could not be explained.\u201cShe reached out to you, who was a nuisance, and came here as a special envoy and opened my eyes. And\u2026\u201d Seal took a moment.It was difficult to speak. A child in the belly of his beloved woman. The child who would be born due to his wife\u2019s affair.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAnd she claimed guardianship over my child.\u201d\u201cWhat, do you have a baby?\u201dSeal nodded. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not exactly my child.\u201d He gulped. \u201cWhen I decided to forgive my wife\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter. From now on, my wife\u2019s child is my child. It\u2019s like that.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if he had forgiven her completely, but at the time, he had decided to embrace his wife\u2019s everything. That was the forgiveness that he was thinking of.\u201cMy child has tremendous magical talent.\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t even been born yet. How would you know that?\u201dSeal only nodded, as if to state the obvious.\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have too many theories about the princess?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dHickson\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cI know Heron Verratoux is my friend.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOkay. No matter how monstrous Verratoux is, would he have that ability?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you have theories in your head, you have to keep it at just the right amount, man. Why would Viola say that? Isn\u2019t that idea too far-fetched? How would a fetus\u2019 magical talent be recognized?\u201dIt was as if Seal had been hit on the head. It made sense, now that he thought about it. Recognizing the magical talent of an unborn child? That was impossible even for the most skilled magicians.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSeal was deeply shocked and speechless for a while. It was like seeing a new side to ViolaHickson smiled and continued to talk, \u201cIt\u2019s true that she\u2019s an iron-blooded Verratoux who knows how to wear a thousand masks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut she\u2019s really warm and cute.\u201d\u201cBeing warm and cute is just a part of being young. Are you kidding?\u201dBut he was being serious! It was an exceptional warmth and cuteness.\u201cBut even though I said it myself that it\u2019s part of being young, somehow Viola being like that is unimaginable.\u201dHickson burst into laughter. He decided to keep the precious secret of Viola\u2019s qualities to himself.It was then that the butler suddenly knocked on our door.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I told you not to disturb us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to report a great disturbance in the castle.\u201d\u201cDisturbance?\u201d\u201cSir Jermi appeared,\u201d the butler reported. The little storm Jermi\u2014whose beauty caused numerous women to follow him into\u2026 entanglements, caused more than a few accidents.Seal\u2019s head started to ache.\u201cThree carriage accidents. Six incidents of injury while pushing each other. And two cases where some of them fought by grabbing each other\u2019s hair. In summary, is this all that happened?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The butler fixed his glasses and continued his report. \u201cIt\u2019s the new culture of young people.\u201d\u201cNew culture?\u201d\u201cYes. This group, which expresses a crazy feeling, is called a \u2018fandom\u2019.\u201d\u201cFans? Fandom? These are all strange terms.\u201d\u201cSome of them are quite radical. They idolize and follow Sir Jermi.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the land?\u201dThe butler took a deep breath.This was the point.\u201cBecause I said I was waiting for the beautiful spirit\u2026 That\u2019s why the fuss grew even bigger. Some extreme fans, who predicted that the \u201cdark young master\u201d was the one they were seeking, grabbed each other\u2019s heads and even fought.\u201d\u201cBut I think I\u2019m waiting for Princess Viola.\u201d[I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the village square.]Viola frowned. At the end of the short note, Jermi\u2019s name was written. Viola recalled the story she had been told. \u201cIf Jermi reveals himself in the village square without a disguise, accidents caused by the fandom will continue.\u201dShe could tell without hearing the news that there must have been a commotion already. It was the early days of fandom culture.The writer also described it themself. Jermi was close to the world\u2019s first-generation idol. Before the mature fandom culture was established, it could be seen as the beginning of the process. As a result, there were much more extreme fans here than in South Korea in the 21st century.\u201cIt\u2019s better not to go out, right?\u201dNo matter how much she thought about it, it was best to stay still. If she got involved with Jermi, that fandom\u2026She didn\u2019t even know if she\u2019d be safe from all these kinds of stones and insults from the people here. However, the letters seemed to appear by themselves on the note. It seemed to have been made to reveal the words over time.[If you don\u2019t arrive after an hour, I\u2019ll sing a hymn for Viola Verratoux.]Viola sighed deeply. \u201cDoes it really have to be this way?\u201dFor Jermi\u2019s fandom, the prestige of House Verratoux was not important. As soon as Jermi sang a hymn dedicated to Viola Verratoux, droves of Jermi\u2019s fans all over the continent would start to think of Viola as their enemy.\u2018This isn\u2019t a dream is it?\u2019Viola called Xenon. \u201cGive me my mask.\u201d\u201cYes, princess.\u201dThis was a special mask created by Seivan Marcos, the puppet master.It was so sophisticated that it was nearly impossible to recognize that it wasn\u2019t the wearer\u2019s real face. After finishing her disguise, Viola took the lead in walking as Xenon trailed closely.Together, they headed to the square with two strong guards to prevent any possible mishaps. They deliberately moved in the direction of the largest and most colorful wagon on the road to prevent getting noticed. As they rode it, more guards were also deployed in advance as a precaution against quarrels.Jermi sat near the central fountain of the square, and hundreds of fans were peeping around him to see him. Some even cried as if their lifelong wishes had come true.\u201cXenon. Did we take that long that a group of hundreds of girls could have gathered here already?\u201d\u201cWe came as soon as we could\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m meeting Lord Jermi like this.\u201d\u201cIs there a need for all this?\u201dA gaudy wagon and a horse used only for exhibitions. The mask made by Seivan Marcos. Even these guards.\u201cNo matter what happens, we can\u2019t cut down innocent people. Even if we take these precautions it would still be a huge risk and we could face a rude crowd.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be quieter to reveal yourself as Viola Verratoux?\u201dViola shook her head. It was true that Xenon was a great butler, but it seemed that he didn\u2019t know enough to fear the threat of an extreme fandom.\u201cThe Verratoux name is useless, too. It doesn\u2019t matter in front of them.\u201d\u201cShould I\u2026?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to stare at me with fire in their eyes. If they find out that I\u2019m Viola Verratoux\u2026\u201dShe imagined a sudden darkness in front of her. They would never see Viola Verratoux in the same way again. Tens of thousands of faceless people. It would result in the creation of a myriad of enemies.Just thinking about it made her shudder.But Viola didn\u2019t say any of that.\u201cThey\u2019ll be rude to Viola Verratoux, and then Viola Verratoux will have to kill them. I don\u2019t want to spill blood when I don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re a princess.\u201dThey arrived in front of the fountain. The carriage door opened and she was escorted down by Xenon\u2014who was also wearing a mask.She got off the wagon.Viola felt numerous eyes on her. \u201cWow.\u201d She felt thrilled for some reason, her heart pounding.\u201cDon\u2019t come out, it\u2019s raining. Stay inside.\u201dSo sharp were her responding emotions that it felt like the original Viola would pop out.It seemed that the life of an idol with a fandom was worse than that of a Verratoux.\u201cYou\u2019ve predicted all this, Scholar Jermi.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Jermi jumped from the fountain and dipped into a bow.\u201cNice to meet you. I don\u2019t really know what to do in these situations.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure to keep you on your toes all the while.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dJermi had predicted this whole situation and called Viola here on purpose.In this situation, she thought that even if all the world\u2019s possible futures had been made, they wouldn\u2019t be something she could change, and the idea was an illusion. Jermi didn\u2019t know Viola well yet. From Jermi\u2019s point of view, she heard an answer that she had never thought of.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He deliberately created this situation so that she could not reject his proposal.However, Viola\u2019s answer was unexpected. \u201cIt means that this place will be where you and I will duel.\u201dJermi doubted his ears at the moment.A duel?\u201cI know\u2026 The duel that I\u2019m thinking of and the duel that you\u2019re thinking of are the same, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Viola pointed at Jermi with a dagger.Jermi shrugged as if embarrassed. Even at that moment, he still did not lose his relaxed smile. \u201cLet me tell you about the duels I know. First, a fight to decide victory or defeat. Second, a battle fought under certain conditions and formalities in order to relieve grudges or insults.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to duel?\u201d\u201cBecause you looked down on me and my family so easily.\u201dThe smile disappeared from Jermi\u2019s face.If she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve offended me so easily,\u201d there was a possibility that it could be resolved through conversation.However, she mentioned her family. The name of the VerratouxIt meant that Viola was that sincere.\u2018Uh\u2026 This isn\u2019t it.\u2019Jermi was perplexed; he didn\u2019t want to duel with Viola. \u201cI just wanted to explore the ruins with you, though I didn\u2019t mention it directly.\u201dViola continued with her dagger pointed at him, \u201cDid you think I was just some pawn on a chessboard that you could move as you please?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Stop, I\u2019ve never thought of you like that.\u201d\u201cYour intentions don\u2019t matter, because that is how it seems to me.\u201dJermi was originally an innocent and positive character. Naive instead of scheming.For example, \u201cIt would be fun to explore the ruins with Princess Viola\u201d or \u201cIf you find a treasure while exploring the ruins,\u201d would light-heartedly be said as, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a gift, Princess Viola, when you come.\u201d\u201cYou made your board, and you acted as if I was playing on it. In front of so many people who followed you, you acted as if I was going to bend according to your will. What do you think of me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u2018Yes, I am Princess Viola Verratoux.\u2019She couldn\u2019t simply say that.There were too many eyes around.He had a sinking feeling that he had just made it harder for himself to become her friend.\u2018You made it impossible to answer. I guess I fell into my own trap?\u2019\u201cTake out the sword.\u201dAt some point, iron-clad guards came and took control of the people.This was also what Viola had requested in advance.Some of the people who flocked here even asked the guards, \u201cJohn. Who the hell is that woman?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut the guards were silent. In fact, they know who that woman was.Since she was a youth from a family of high rank, they only moved at her orders.\u201cWho dares to ask Sir Jermi for a duel?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy won\u2019t you say anything? Is it not allowed?\u201d\u201cIt is, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a good opportunity to see Sir Jermi\u2019s excellent swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cHuh? I think so too.\u201dViola could feel it. The longing of Jermi\u2019s fans.How dare she draw your weapon against Sir Jermi?They\u2019d be expecting Jermi to perform a beautiful sword trick and subdue her gracefully.\u2018Wow\u2026 Their eyes are fierce. How can there be no one on my side?\u2019\u201cSir Jermi! Show us what you can do!\u201d\u201cSir Jermi! Please scold me for being immature!\u201dHis position became even more difficult.\u2018Ah. This isn\u2019t it\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t mean to do this. He only wanted to have fun with Viola, but\u2026\u2018Do you want me to show you? A reckless young girl?\u2019Jermi scratched his head at what she seemed to be saying. In fact, he wanted to pull his hair out, but he couldn\u2019t. If it remained like this, the situation would get worse and worse.The favor of the crowd was twisting the situation.\u201cThen, shall we move?\u201d I don\u2019t think this is the right place to have a duel.\u201d\u201cSir Hickson. Will you be okay?\u201d\u201cJust call me as usual. What kind of bastard am I to be called \u2018Sir Hickson\u2019?\u201dThe viscount frowned. He used more genteel words because they were in front of children, but that didn\u2019t work for Hickson.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cIt will be fine. Viola is smart. She always thinks one step ahead.\u201dStill, it was worrying. Their gazes followed the two children.Viola was great, but she was still a 12-year-old girl. Her physical development was not comparable to that of Jermi\u2019s.At that age, there is a huge difference that an extra year of growth can make.Besides, the opponent was Jermi, who is already called a small storm.Jermi said with a shy smile, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any spectators now. Can\u2019t I just apologize and move on?\u201d\u201cI am a Verratoux. Don\u2019t you remember what I said?\u201d\u201cWhat was it?\u201dIn her first meeting with Jermi, Viola told him to come in his true form.Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsite\u201cBut you didn\u2019t show any truth at all. It was hard to understand. He made me do all this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d\u201cI think the time to end with an apology has passed.\u201d\u201cAre you really going to have a duel with me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always been sincere since the moment you called me out in private.\u201dOf course, she didn\u2019t mean it. If she really fought, she\u2019d be in trouble. There was no way that she could properly fight a master swordsman.As a last resort, she might have to trigger the real Viola.\u201cHow can I fight with a princess?\u201d\u201cWhy not? Because I\u2019m a Verratoux?\u201d Viola moved her head to the side with a seemingly confused expression. \u201cThe House of Verratoux will not seek retribution for any injuries or deaths caused by a legitimate duel. You won\u2019t have any trouble, so you can relax.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d Jermi scratched the back of his head. In fact, Jermi had never faced a woman with a sword yet. \u201cA duel with a lady is a little\u2026\u201dHe was a major supporting role who believed that knightly abilities should be used to protect ladies.\u2018But it\u2019s a different story if it\u2019s a warrior who has learned swordsmanship.\u2019Even if the opponent was a woman, if the opponent was a warrior, Jermi would do his best to deal with it. It was courtesy among warriors. However, he was still young and had not yet had a duel with a woman. It meant he was still naive.\u201cI first faced a woman with a sword at the age of 19. Medea. I couldn\u2019t withstand her strength for even three seconds.\u201dIt was said that it was the right time to fight a woman at the age of 19.He was originally a dull person who believed that women were weak until he met Medea in the original story.Viola pointed out his prejudice properly. \u201cDoes it mean that I can\u2019t deal with you because I\u2019m a woman?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201d\u201cBefore I am a woman, I am a warrior. You seem to be determined to insult me, Sir.\u201d\u201cOh no, Princess Viola. That\u2019s not it.\u201dThen Tundra came out.He knelt down on one knee and spoke politely, \u201cMaster. Is it okay if I fight for you?\u201d\u201cYou? Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. The master is a much stronger person than me, so I didn\u2019t think there was any need to cross swords with Scholar Jermi.\u201dJermi was rendered speechless.Viola felt bad for saying it, but his side insulted me first, so there.He couldn\u2019t really refute the insult.\u201cYou won\u2019t run away from me, with your tail between your legs, will you, Scholar?\u201dShe saw it in Jermi\u2019s eyes.The current Tundra was an eye-catching fighter.In case of an accident, if the situation got too dangerous, Hickson would jump in to stop it.Only then did Viola relax.\u2018Ah. done.\u2019While avoiding a direct duel, she also maintained her prestige as a Verratoux. Hickson would intervene, so nobody was going to die.\u2018Is this going to make Jermi a little uncomfortable with me?\u2019That would be for the best.He may not be the type to hold grudges, but just a little discomfort was fine.Meanwhile, Tundra stared at Jermi while holding a large iron sword. Instead of his own sword, Jermi picked up an ordinary iron sword borrowed from the viscount.\u201cTundra, you\u2019ve spent five years learning the sword, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been over ten years for me\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I will use this sword. It\u2019s not about disrespecting you, it\u2019s about pursuing fairness for the time we spent learning each other\u2019s swords, so I hope you don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d\u201cAs you please.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter to Tundra. He didn\u2019t think he was having a duel now. Duels were a pastime for nobility, or perhaps great warriors.\u2019I hunt.\u2019His identity as Viola\u2019s hound gave him confidence. It was okay if the method was not noble. All he had to do was hunt.Tundra was dramatically different from who he was in the original story.\u2018I didn\u2019t like you from the beginning.\u2019It was like that from the first meeting.\u2018You even walked out of my master\u2019s room. Even in the middle of the night.\u2019That provoked Tundra\u2019s wrath, which had been looking for a way to escape.Seeing that, Jermi had a subtle smirk.Those eyes weren\u2019t those of a dueling warrior. They held a dog\u2019s possessive desire to monopolize their master\u2014in this case, Princess Viola.He didn\u2019t understand completely, but he understood enough.\u2018At first, I just wanted to get to know her.\u2019It wasn\u2019t that he was romantically interested in her. Viola was too young to be considered a woman, and Jermi wasn\u2019t interested in little girls.That was it.In Jermi\u2019s view, Viola was an interesting and mysterious princess, so he wanted to get close.\u201cIf you come out this far, I\u2019ll go, too.\u201dIt gives you energy.\u2019He felt that it was somewhat unexpected to see him so obsessed with Viola. It seemed that he also had the same wish.\u2018It\u2019s not like you\u2019re the only one who can get close.\u2019As if reading his mind, Tundra said, \u201cYour eyes. I like them.\u201d\u201cI should fight with all my heart\u201d.\u201cYeah. I\u2019m starting to get tired of it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s coming?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how naturally talented Tundra was, the time he took to master the sword itself was still not enough.Viola watched the duel between the two carefully.Hickson smiled and said, \u201cBut you still fight pretty well, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be hard to win.\u201d\u201cNo. You have to win against Tundra because he\u2019s fighting on behalf of me.\u201dJermi and Tundra collided again.Jermi\u2019s sword stretched sharply toward Tundra\u2019s neck, and Tundra quickly avoided the sword and stabbed his opponent.\u201cTundra. Is that all my hunting dog can do?\u201dHe was definitely doing well. He was almost on par with a swordsman who had twice the amount of experience.Viola\u2019s intervention temporarily stopped the duel.\u201cGasp\u2026!\u201d Tundra was very tired, but his eyes were blazing.Rather, the fire in his eyes was more alive than the first time.\u201cPrince Jermi has a habit of giving strength to his index finger before the sword is launched.\u201dViola did not discover this herself. It was mentioned in the novel. Later, it was a big weakness for him.\u201cIt would be helpful to distinguish between a true attack and a feint.\u201dWhen it came to a real attack, strength went into the index finger.As the force is applied to the index finger, the little finger is relatively slightly stretched out.It was Jermi\u2019s bad habit.\u201cFeel the rhythm, but also observe the patterns.\u201dJermi\u2019s first attack was always a light stab.\u201cNow every attack of the Storm Sword begins with a stab.\u201dThe movement itself was simple.It was just that it was so fast and natural that it was hard to parry.\u201cAccording to the response to the stab, Prince Jermi\u2019s next move is decided.\u201dIf it was a retreat, there was a nine out of ten chance that he would go deep.If it was a counterattack, he would step to the right.Hearing those words, Jermi smiled involuntarily.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026 That\u2019s true, right?\u2019The movements that remained in his subconscious now seemed to be clearly visible to Viola.\u201cAs expected of a Verratoux! How\u2019d you figure it out? You must be more skilled than me; that\u2019s the only way you can see right through me, right?\u201dAlthough she was still young and her physicality was not astounding, it was said that she was born with the ability to read the flow. A few years later, as time went by, Viola might become a stronger master far beyond himself.Clang!Jermi\u2019s sword was broken.Being cheap, it likely could no longer endure the sheer amount of strain it had experienced over the past hours.Flop.Tundra, who broke Jermi\u2019s sword, passed out.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a tie.\u201dOne had a broken sword and the other fainted.Jermi shrugged as if regretful. It was a draw against Viola\u2019s hound, so it was his loss. \u201cYes, it is a draw. I know it\u2019s only been a few years since he\u2019s learned the sword, but your companion\u2019s sword here is truly worthy of protecting you. I think he deserves to be Sir Hickson\u2019s disciple.\u201d His gaze shifted to viola, a soft smile on his face. \u201cAnd Princess Viola. Thank you. Thanks to you, I caught a bad habit.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to help.\u201d.\u201cThank you for the good teaching, Medea. One day, I will surely overcome you and capture the house of Verratoux. Thank you for saving me today.\u201dThat was how it was said in the novel.At that point, Medea was both an enemy and a benefactor.The weaknesses of Jermi that Viola pointed out were actually those that Medea had later pointed out.\u201cIs Scholar Jermi still learning the Storm Sword?\u201d\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201d\u201cSame as Tundra\u2019s style, that one has a strong momentum and consumes mana very quickly, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI think it will be of great help if he practices meditation.\u201d\u201cIs yoga considered meditation?\u201dAs soon as he heard that, Hickson burst into laughter. The yoga meditation ceremony was the breathing method and basic exercise method that noble girls of this world learned.However, it was also something that would later be re-evaluated by Jermi.\u201cIf I had learned the Yoga meditation five years earlier, I would have achieved a lot more.\u201dAnyway, at this point in time, the yoga meditation ceremony was the kind that the warriors were learning. It was not a meditation ceremony.\u201cAre you laughing at me for barely having a draw with your dog?\u201d\u201cNo way. I respect those who do their best. Thank you for honoring my swordsman.\u201dJermi looked at Viola for a long time with interested eyes.Viola seemed sincere.\u201cYou want me to learn how to meditate?\u2019It wasn\u2019t a joke.He didn\u2019t know why she said that, but he understood.\u201cI see. Princess Viola\u2019s words are worthy of deep consideration. Anyway, I noticed a bad habit thanks to Princess Viola today, and I think I can improve upon it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cAnd since I tied with your dog\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPlease support our website and read on wuxiaworldsite\u201cI sincerely apologize for all my actions. I was just motivated to be close to the princess.\u201d\u201cAre you apologizing only with words?\u201d\u201cIs there anything you want?\u201dViola smiled lightly.Jermi somehow felt afraid of that smile, feeling as if the skin of his face was being pricked.\u201cI already know Scholar Jermi\u2019s advantage.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThat process and method were just wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to take that same favor and win.\u201dThe so-called \u201cMad Wizard\u2019s Laboratory\u201d.There, Jermi signed a contract with a spirit with the name of \u201cKell,\u201d which later grew into the Spirit of the Wind.\u2018If I could sign a contract with a spirit there\u2026\u2019It would make her life so much easier.The \u201cMad Wizard\u2019s Laboratory\u201d was a very special place, a strange historic site where one could make a contract with a spirit even without a high affinity with the spirit world.In other words, it was an opportunity to meet a bodyguard, no, the guardian spirit.\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to visit the ruins with Sir Jermi.\u201d\u201cI thought you would say no.\u201d\u201cI was going to say no until I saw you really fighting with my dog.\u201dThat was a lie, she had no intention of rejecting it. She was trying to get all the benefits possible while maintaining a proper distance from Jermi.Jermi, who was currently feeling equal parts confused and foolish.\u201cI have decided to acknowledge Sir Jermi as a warrior, so I\u2019ve decided to accompany you. I enjoyed seeing you fight in the way of the storm. It\u2019s a great achievement.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d He rubbed his nose.It made him feel good that such a skilled Verratoux such as Viola seemed to be recognizing his skills.\u201cInstead,\u201d Viola brought up the topic. \u201cAgree to give me priority if I get anything there.\u201dJermi pondered for a moment. Nobody knew what would come out of the ruins. It was even possible to get nothing at all.\u2018But Princess Viola deliberately taught me by pointing out my weaknesses and wrong habits.\u2019If it were his enemy, he wouldn\u2019t have taught them.\u2018In addition, she even protected my pride.\u2019She didn\u2019t teach him in person. By pretending to give Tundra advice, she handed Jermi the information.He judged that it was Viola\u2019s meticulous and warm consideration. \u201cI think my father will be angry if I blindly accept the condition. Actually, it\u2019s information that my father gave me.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t accompany you.\u201d\u201cWhy are you in such a hurry?\u201d Jermi laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll make an additional condition, too. Listen. It won\u2019t be a loss.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI became interested in the princess. I want to get close to you. It\u2019s amazing that you have those eyes at that age. I think we have to let go of our grudges to get to know each other. I was going to let go from last time, but I ended up losing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJermi bit his lip slightly to show his determination.A strong commitment made it easier to speak.As soon as possible, he spoke quickly, \u201cIf you refuse to talk, I will officially ask the Verratoux family for an engagement.\u201d\u201cEngagement?\u201dViola was well aware that he had no interest in women or marriage.Even at this moment, the curiosity in Jermi\u2019s eyes was not at all curiosity in her as a woman.Viola Verratoux was mysterious in this man\u2019s eyes for her strange kindness.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in women or marriage anyway. If I have to get married anyway, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to have a relationship with a Verratoux. There\u2019s no reason to reject me, right? In my own way, I am the successor to the Storm Fortress, and the House of Verratoux can get their hands on a southern fortress. Geographically, it\u2019s a very, very good position to keep the empire in check, and your family can also kill two birds with one stone. Perhaps Princess Viola, a white Verratoux, thinks so too. What do you think?\u201dViola laughed incredulously at how marriage was being used as a negotiation point. \u201cAs a condition of transferring the priority of compensation, I accept informal speech.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be engaged with me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dJermi was one of the main supporting actors, a person who grew up overcoming all kinds of dangers and adversity.There were always villains and traps around him.If one wasn\u2019t a fan living for Jermi\u2019s face, it\u2019s best to stay away.\u201cPeople say I\u2019m handsome\u201d.\u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201d\u201cThen why won\u2019t you accept the engagement?\u201dWhat was wrong with him? He wasn\u2019t even interested in her like that.Viola sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not my cup of tea.\u201d\u2018Your face is my preference, but your life is too dangerous.\u2019She wasn\u2019t about to ruin her plans for a safe, happy life for a pretty face.\u201cI\u2019m so sad to hear that. I think Princess Viola is cute.\u201d\u201cThank you for the empty words.\u201dHickson\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018That kid!\u2019There was another human who recognized Viola\u2019s cuteness hidden the cold demeanor and wintry tone.\u2018Isn\u2019t he a pretty good guy?\u2019No one else that Viola Verratoux was cute. There weren\u2019t many people who had taste.Even Viola herself didn\u2019t know how cute she was.\u2018But I don\u2019t like it either.\u2019It was as if someone else had learned a secret which only he had known. The realization was strangely upsetting.Anyway, Hickson was happy that Viola refused the engagement immediately.\u201cSo, we decided to speak casually\u201d.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019re friends now, right?\u201dViola agreed expressionlessly, while Jermi\u2019s smile was beatific.At that point, Tundra came to his senses and heard the tail end of their conversation. His eyes opened wide.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His cries even expended a small amount of mana.Hickson hit the back of Tundra\u2019s head. \u201cWhy are you screaming and going crazy?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWith those final words, Jermi and Viola went on and held hands.To be exact, it was actually just for a handshake, but in Tundra\u2019s eyes, it seemed to have been holding hands.He felt very unpleasant, thus asking Hickson, \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t you feel bad?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPrince Jermi said he would be friends with the princess.\u201d\u201cViola accepted it.\u201dInstinctively, he hated it. The fact that Viola was burdened with Jermi.That was why he hated him.\u201cViola. I\u2019m going to borrow him for a second.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI have a place to take him to.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can tell you. Anyway, I thought of a way to make this man more powerful.\u201dTundra actually tried to refuse. He didn\u2019t want to be away from Viola for a moment, thinking it was a natural mindset as a dog.\u201cWill he become stronger?\u201d\u2018He realized it again while having a duel with Jermi. Tundra was progressing rapidly, but it was not enough compared to how far he had yet to go. If he had won overwhelmingly, it occurred to him that Viola would not have become friends with Jermi.\u201cTundra, do you want to go?\u201dNo.He wanted to be by her side more.But he hid his secret. He had to be strong.\u201cI will go.\u201d\u201cYeah, then go.\u201dThis sight was also unfamiliar to Jermi. The Viola that he thought of was a person who ruled and commanded.\u2018For someone to act like that towards a servant\u2026\u2019Still, she seemed to care enough about Tundra.She asked Tundra\u2019s intention first, and she was doing what Tundra wanted.Viola spoke informally, \u201cLet\u2019s go tomorrow at nine in the morning. Is that good?\u201d\u201cOkay, good. I\u2019ll be waiting at the front gate.\u201dWatching Jermi comfortably talking informally, Tundra growled again.***That night.Tundra went to the place where Jermi was staying, a shabby inn\u2019s room instead of a comfortable room provided by the institution.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dJermi shrugged. \u201cWhat kind of place is this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAn old and shabby place?\u201d Jermi laughed softly. \u201cMost people live like this. Have you forgotten?\u201dTundra lived in far worse places than this one. His family had lived in a hut made of logs in a mountainous area without any infrastructure.The security was bad and there was not enough food to eat.\u2018\u2026I forgot.\u2019His life with Viola was so abundant.As he lived in a finely crafted house with everything, he forgot about the previous state of his life.\u201cIf you look down from a high place, you cannot empathize with many people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you are a man of great power, you should have an eye-level suitable for that power. You said you want to be next to Viola.\u201d\u2018Why are you suddenly preaching to me?\u2019Tundra was speechless at the moment. He didn\u2019t understand what Jermi was saying, so he just quietly listened.\u201cViola is a ruler. I was born with a similar fate. The both of us must act like this, act appropriately.\u201dJermi read Viola\u2019s greed. In his eyes, she was a little girl who wanted to swallow Verratoux whole.\u201cSo you have to fill in for the things that Viola can\u2019t do. A role that empathizes with the people and approaches them from a humble point of view.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe was a person with great ambition and desire to dominate, but at the same time, she was a warm person. There was a gap between what she wanted to be and what she was.\u201cShe\u2019s a warm person. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m also a person who shouldn\u2019t be seen as warm. To anyone. So, for warmth\u2026 That role is yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for your advice.\u201d\u201cWhy did you come to see me?\u201d\u201cI came to warn you.\u201d\u201cWarning? What warning?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so close to the princess. What are your intentions?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I want to be friends with her.\u201d\u201cEven at the expense of damages?\u201d Tundra thought Jermi was being reckless.He\u2019d even hand over the priority of compensation for whatever was found at the historical sites. It was difficult for him to understand why Jermi made this choice.\u201cCan\u2019t I just take the loss and leave it at that?\u201dWhat?\u201cI have a crush on Viola.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t something he could explain, something beyond rationality.Jermi felt intrigued and amused when he saw her.\u201cIf I like someone, can\u2019t I lose some money?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s your intention, I guess so\u201d.\u201cExactly.\u201dHowever, Tundra did not fully believe in Jermi.Among the rumors about the scholar, there were also many rumors of ill intent.Regardless of his conduct, he was wildly influential. There were also rumors that he had deceived many young women. It was an unavoidable rumor that followed him because of his splendid appearance.\u201cIf you do anything wrong to the princess, I\u2019ll slit your throat.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit excessive?\u201dJermi tilted his head. Rather than feeling bad, he looked genuinely curious. \u201cIf you claim to be a faithful servant, be faithful to your role. You\u2019re obsessed with the princess.\u201d\u201cI think you misunderstand my role. I don\u2019t intend to be a loyal servant. My dream is not to be a servant, but a dog.\u201d\u201cAre you serious about that?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dPlease support our website and read on wuxiaworldsiteJermi read the sincerity contained in Tundra\u2019s eyes.To be able to say such nonsense so seriously\u2026Even Jermi smiled in vain. \u201cDo you get jealous if I hold her hand when I talk to her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not holding hands, it\u2019s shaking hands.\u201d\u201cBut the physical touch is there.\u201dTundra growled again.Jermi felt that sound was very interesting. \u201cHmm, anyway, you\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s a research subject.\u201dReturning to his own mansion, Tundra was deeply thoughtful. His head and heart were in conflict.\u2018Jermi seems like a good guy.\u2019That\u2019s how he felt. He had a special ability to sense the smell of mana. That helped him roughly guess whether a person was good or bad.Jermi\u2019s smell was good. No malice was felt at all.\u2018But why do I hate him?\u2019He was definitely a good person, one who could be of great help to Viola.\u2018Then I guess I\u2019ll have to maintain a good relationship with Jermi.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t want to.\u2019\u2018Why?\u2019\u2018I\u2019m someone who helps Viola.\u2019\u2018I should like it when she makes decisions that are good for her position.\u2019\u2018I do not know.\u2019Tundra tossed and turned in anguish after a long time.***Viola, who was treated to a grand farewell dinner by Viscount Seal, changed into comfortable leather clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe princess in leather is nice too, but in fact, the dress is much cuter.\u201dViola frowned slightly.In the original, Xenon never mentioned \u2018cuteness\u2019.Of course.Because Verratoux and cuteness could not coexist.\u201cI told you to try it on. Is it cold?\u201dBut again, it was awkward, Xenon looked so serious.\u2018No. Don\u2019t be fooled.\u2019Viola in the original was a genius.Xenon was the character who doubted and tested that genius until the end of the work.A person who was a strong ally and always had to be vigilant.\u201cIf you say the word cute one more time, I will sew your mouth shut.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dXenon was truly disappointed. What should he do? He was only telling the truth, but it seemed that she really hated the word.Didn\u2019t people normally like it?As expected, a Verratoux was a Verratoux.\u201cApologies\u201dXenon hid his heart. Still, his imagination was free. \u201cWhat kind of dress do you want to buy next time?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhat dagger would look good on that dress?The greatsword used by Princess Medea would go well with it. It\u2019d be really cute.He posted a report hiding his feelings.\u201cI posted a report to the great house and an answer came down.\u201dThe answer was brief.In summary, \u201cWell done. Great job!\u201d\u201cThere was no Verratoux who was able to accomplish these things at the age of twelve. Even if they had achievements of beating up evil spirits or subjugating bandits, no one had ever managed to win a person\u2019s heart by penetrating human and political relationships. Not even the First Princess, who is said to be amazing, too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dViola just wanted the future to be on my side. Besides politics and complicated relationships, the only thing she wanted was to be safe from the archmage who had gone after her in the novel.\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about permission to explore the remains. Of course, it was a formal reporting procedure.\u201dVerratoux\u2019s degree of freedom for successor candidates was something she respected. As long as she reported that she went on the exploration, there would be no problems.\u201cBut it\u2019s a little odd.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe asked me to do a background check on Sir Jermi.\u201d\u201cA background check?\u201dViola tilted her head.\u2018Why?\u2019Were there any scenes like that in the novel?She didn\u2019t think there were.\u201cYes. So I\u2019m going to do some background research.\u201d\u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t have to investigate Jermi\u2019s background.\u201dWas there a reason to do that?Was there anything she was missing?Viola thought about the contents of the novel and the setting book, but she couldn\u2019t remember anything.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dXenon guessed it was the desire of a father who had a daughter, but he didn\u2019t say it out loud.***It was 9 a.m.Hickson and Tundra left for somewhere, and Xenon and Viola headed to the main gate with greetings from their own families and outsiders.\u201cPrincess Viola. Long time no see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a day.\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d Jermi was wearing a mask.He seemed like a completely different person.Xenon, who was following her, moved swiftly. It was soft and natural as if a ghost was moving.\u201cBy the way, Sir Jermi.\u201d He stood in front of Viola like a shield. \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dXenon said something unbelievable.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s my plan.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d Jermi didn\u2019t understand.Xenon laughed amusedly.\u201cA background check?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dViola looked at Jermi. And at Xenon, too. There was an awkward silence between the two.\u201cYou\u2019ve already given me the background check.\u201d\u201cHmm, I\u2019m talking about my personal investigation. I\u2019ll do it. Not someone else. I\u2019m going to do some research on Jermi\u201d.\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to get permission.\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t allow it, you won\u2019t do it, is that it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll still do it.\u201d\u201cThen why did you ask?\u201d\u201cStill, it matters what other people feel, regardless of permission.\u201dJermi blinked for a moment.Even he couldn\u2019t catch up.Viola is quite familiar with Xenon\u2019s strange personality. She just watched the events unfold. \u201cBut why do you want to do a background check?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThere was no problem with Jermi\u2019s outward appearance, so it must have been something else.Xenon seemed to be hiding something, but why?No matter how much Viola thought about it, there was no particular reason.\u201cInstead of allowing the investigation\u2026 Let\u2019s bet on something.\u201d\u201cWhat conditions do you propose?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll speak informally.\u201dJeremy laughed loudly. Viola\u2019s smile was a bit cheeky.\u201cIf you go back to talking to me formally, I won\u2019t forget it.\u201dXenon said he\u2019d do a backup investigation, so she would allow it.\u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019re both out of their minds.\u2019She had to pull herself together.People who are out of their minds were all over the world.\u201cBut why are you doing a background check on me?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d Xenon tilted his head, thinking of an appropriate lie and finding none to give. \u201cThe duke gave me an order.\u201d\u201cDuke Heron?\u201d\u201cYes, he ordered it in writing.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Why would I ask? I\u2019ve never thought about that.\u201d\u201cBut you must have some idea, at least.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dViola blinked. Why was her father ordering an investigation on Jermi?This development was not in the original at all. The story had no mention of such a thing happening.\u2019Unfamiliar things are happening. Am I changing the story too much?\u2019Well, she couldn\u2019t be too surprised. Logically speaking, the butterfly effect wasn\u2019t something she could control.\u2018Between the Winter Castle and the Storm Castle, I think there\u2019s a political issue.\u2019But Jermi thought a little differently. \u201cAs expected, the duke can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s a father.\u201dHe tried to look at the big picture as Viola did, intuitively grasping the idea.\u201cThis is a natural consequence of approaching a daughter who\u2019s about to enter society.\u201dAs someone with the kind of appearance that drove all kinds of rumors, Jermi could understand. The rumors were absurd, like the one where he was secretly married even at such a young age, but people still believed them.\u201cWhen someone like me approaches someone from an influential family\u2026\u201dIt was only natural for suspicions to pop up.\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Jermi said.\u201cBut openly like this?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t ordered to keep it a secret\u201d.\u201cFor missions that require discretion, of course, I take all the precautions,\u201d Xenon reassured.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThat said, I don\u2019t think this is a mission that requires me to keep it a secret.\u201dJermi laughed. \u201cSo, the justification is a background check.\u201dIt was also a warning. Both of them were high-profile, so it was easy for things to get out of hand unexpectedly.\u201cI\u2019ll be watching you openly, so keep yourself in check.\u201d\u201cAll this consideration, what is all this?\u201d Jermi found it more and more fun, especially because of his recent encounter with Tundra\u2026\u2019So that\u2019s what the Tundra meant.\u2019He thought of himself as a dog, so it was natural for him to be protective\u2014even possessive\u2014of Viola.\u2019But even the Duke of Heron?\u2019Jermi was growing more and more determined to be friends with her.\u201cThat sounds like a good idea,\u201d he said, then muttered to himself very quietly, \u201cI want to get closer to you gradually.\u201dViola, the current object of his interest, felt uneasy. Thoughts bounced around her head as they traveled to their destination.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with my father?\u2019\u2018What politics are involved in this?\u2019\u2018Am I improving?\u2019\u2018As a White Verratoux, what kind of position do I have?\u2019\u2018Should I take a stronger stance?\u2019\u2018This wasn\u2019t in the novel!\u2019By the time they arrived at the Red Tree Forest, her head was aching.Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsiteThe red-barked trees surrounded the path that they were on.\u201cThe first expedition team went missing around here. We\u2019ll be going deeper\u2026 to the exact location.\u201d Jermi pointed at a place on the map, taking the lead.They walked for about two hours until Jermi started pointing out more locations. \u201cThe second expedition went missing here. And the third expedition was supposed to arrive at a historic site here.\u201dDiscovering the existence of historical sites was the role of the sergeant in each expedition. It was their job to revitalize the site and explore its capabilities. Such an important task was usually relegated to those in authority.\u201cI hope what they found here was something very good\u201d.According to the setting in the novel, here was an ancient civilization that used to exist here. Most of the historical sites that were currently being discovered were remnants of this \u201cGolden Magic Civilization\u201d.There were numerous magic books and history books that attested to the fact that in this civilization there was magical water that caused superhuman healing, as well as countless technologies and magical knowledge.\u201cThese can be used to help the people in their daily lives.\u201dI hope that this was what the magic could be used for. Even someone like the original Viola\u2026 She would want something like this, right?Most of the objects of the Golden Magic Civilization were valuable and potentially a great help, but they could also be abused by those who wanted to gain more power. This was why all sorts of people, whether warriors or wizards, wanted to access the site.Viola had to do it before them and make a name for herself. She wanted everything, especially things that could be used for the betterment of humanity.\u201cBut we don\u2019t know what will come out from here,\u201d Jermi said.But she did. It will be a special way to form a contract with a spirit. A magic circle can amplify one\u2019s affinity with the spirits to help.In order to do that, first of all, they needed to search for the circle.\u2019Viola, how does this place move?\u2019She didn\u2019t know what traps were surrounding them, nor was she certain that she would be able to form a contract.\u201cLet\u2019s stay still for now.\u201dIt was her first time in a place where she had to make big decisions that weren\u2019t explicitly mentioned in the novel. Even if she knew a lot, there was only so much she could plan for. Additionally, they had been there for six hours already and nighttime was fast approaching.\u201cIt\u2019s already dark.\u201d Xenon started a bonfire. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything dangerous around, and we do need the light and warmth.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing dangerous? But haven\u2019t expeditions gone missing here?\u201d Viola got to the point.\u201cBased on your standards, there isn\u2019t anything dangerous here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Ordinary people who don\u2019t have mana should be held to different standards.Don\u2019t say it\u2019s safe here when it\u2019s clearly not.\u201d\u201cFine, then this is a very dangerous forest, Princess. What should I do?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down,\u201d she replied.Xenon smiled.He was testing her again. As a butler of the Verratoux family, he evidently knew the importance of being alert. Even if things seemed calm, there was always the threat of danger.Viola\u2019s warning was simple.Don\u2019t relax and just because it doesn\u2019t seem dangerous. Be serious.It was a sincere warning.\u2018As expected of our princess!\u2019Viola inwardly sighed in relief. It was important to remember that what was not dangerous to those from Verratoux was\u2026 deadly to others.In any case, they had to do their best to keep safe. The forest at night was quite scary, and even the novel had described it as a place not for the faint of heart\u2014what with audible howling and ghoulish monsters with red eyes.If Xenon was vigilant, it would be safe, at least.Whoo~An ominous wind blew from somewhere.Viola also heard shrill whistles mingling with the sounds of rain. It made her tense, unable to sleep.Why was the floor wet? The magic tent was designed to maintain a certain temperature and humidity, and yet the interior was wet for no reason.It eventually became morning.The ominous wind disappeared and so did the whistling, much to her peace of mind.The morning sunlight penetrated the leaves, revealing their surroundings.In the novel, Jermi had spent a long time wandering here. The chapter was titled, \u201cA Few Days Later, By Chance,\u201d and there was an entire narration of what he had experienced.\u2018I don\u2019t want to stay here for long.\u2019Viola thought of her warm bed and delicious meals at home.And started craving egg tarts. And honey-glazed pancakes. And ice-cold strawberry ade! Or maybe strawberry cakes? Or a shake?\u201cHow long are we going to wander around?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been two days.\u201d\u201cStill, doesn\u2019t it feel weird?\u201dJermi was a professional explorer, and yet he didn\u2019t seem unsettled at all despite the fact that two other expeditions had failed.\u2019Come to think about it, this process is outrageous.\u2019The expedition must first find the ruins, explore them, and then report back to the powerful aristocrats, who would then arrive to explore.The truth was that even with ordinary people, if they died or got hurt, the responsibility was solely on the nobility, the powerful people who couldn\u2019t protect them.In any case, their group had to stick together. They had to explore first and not split up.\u2019I need to do this for my safety and happiness. So I can live to an old age, I\u2019ll have to be vigilant and proactive.\u2019The power we could find here had the ability to change society. To illustrate, the success of talented explorers would grant them a noble title.Viola pulled out her dagger, willing herself to focus, and slightly drew on her mana.\u201cThis dagger is from the Winter Star Workshop It\u2019s an enchanted item.\u201d\u201cIt looks like it.\u201d\u201cAny wood will get scratched the moment it touches it.\u201dBut no scratches appeared on the bark.\u201cRed wood is pretty hard, it was once used to make magical armor.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that\u201d\u201cMaybe because it was strong only against particular types of magic. With the development of civilization, fire magic also came about, and red wood was vulnerable to it. As such, it was used less and less until it disappeared.\u201dViola pointed to a tree.\u201cLook at the tip of that tree.\u201d Jermi\u2019s head was turned.I looked at where he was looking. \u201cAren\u2019t the branches strange?\u201d\u201cUh, come to think of it, it does. It looks like it\u2019s been cut upwards.\u201dSome of the branches were in the shape of a trident. Considering the characteristics of the red tree, it was definitely unique.\u201cSomeone artificially made that.\u201dIs that what they were looking for?Viola walked to the tree and touched it\u2026[What are you?]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was it perhaps a spirit speaking? It seemed likely.\u201cViola. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dJermi stood in front of the red tree whose branches were split into a trident shape. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying this tree is suspicious, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNow that she\u2019d given him a hint, he would probably do it on his own. Viola just watched. In truth, the only thing written in the novel was that he had accidentally stumbled upon the strange-looking tree and entered the historic site through it.\u201cHmm.\u201dIn the meantime, she heard another voice.[What are you? Answer me.]Viola agonized for a moment. How would she answer? It would only look like she was talking to herself.\u2018There was no such content in the novel.\u2019Spirits appeared when entering the historic site, but no spirits had been found in the Red Tree Forest.Jermi\u2019s conversation with the spirit was also after entering the historic site, so she didn\u2019t know why this was happening.[I know you can hear my voice. I\u2019ve never seen anyone with as high spirit affinity as you.]\u2018You can hear my voice because I have an affinity with spirits?\u2019That was a quality acquired at birth, an absolute power. That the spirit claimed she had it\u2026 it was confusing.Viola in the novel had no spirit affinity. She was indeed an excellent Verratoux, but she was by no means \u2018spiritual\u2019 in any sense of the word.Thus, this condition was due to her actual identity as someone from another world. In the setting, spirits were beings from different worlds. It was said that these beings exerted their power and appeared in the human world through their contractors.The so-called, \u201copening the spirit gate through a contract.\u201d In other words, the gate must be opened to pass through worlds.That was the setting of this novel.According to the law in this novel, Han Arin had also passed through the spirit gate. That\u2019s why she became a character with a very high spirit affinity.\u2019Jermi said, \u201cAs expected, this tree really is suspicious.\u201dAnd then he said something she didn\u2019t understand.\u201cA special magic circle is engraved. This magic technique is an arcane lock based on Germanato\u2019s Third Formula.\u201dThe warriors of this era always had to keep in mind the battle against wizards. So, even if she did not learn magic, Viola was quite knowledgeable about the theories and studies of magicians.It was the same for Jermi.He tilted his head. \u201cAs far as I know, this magic needs the help of a spirit. Without the help of the spirit, we can\u2019t pass this defensive magic unless you reverse and break it.\u201dThat was what the textbook said.It was not heavy-duty, but it needed help from a spirit to break.\u201cBut Viola you can see it.\u201dWhen Viola saw through the essence, the illusion magic was automatically dispelled.She realized why.\u2018It\u2019s because of the affinity.\u2019Viola started to get a little excited. This place was special because even those who did not have a strong affinity could make a contract.What if someone with a high level of spirit affinity went in?Maybe it was only mentioned in passing. A colossal being like the spirit king. Wouldn\u2019t it be possible to make a powerful contract?It would be best if the spirit king appeared as a guardian spirit.\u201cI guess my spirit affinity is higher than I thought.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. The blood of the spirits and Verratoux are compatible. Ah\u2014\u201d Jermi recalled one thing he had forgotten.Viola was not a blood-born daughter of Verratoux. She seemed more like one than anyone else, so it was difficult to remember.\u2019It makes sense, since she\u2019s adopted.\u2019It was still surreal that Viola Verratoux had a high spirit affinity. It made him want to be close to her. He felt like his life would be filled with exciting, enjoyable things if he stayed close to her.Jermi touched a red tree. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be different if you place your hand here and apply mana to it.\u201dUnfortunately, Viola was feeling dizzy at the moment.\u2019I\u2019m just holding it in, but I wonder if Jermi\u2019s feeling sick too?\u2019She felt something familiar.\u201cWow. I\u2019m not feeling well. It\u2019s my first time at the gate.\u201dIt appeared that they had already entered the historical site through the tree.[Hohoho][Kekeke]She heard voices from all over the place.\u201cViola. Can you hear me?\u201d\u201cYes, I can hear you.\u201dJermi nodded.\u201cThe whistling is like this sound of laughter.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dIt seemed that the wind made strange sounds through the forest.\u201cDid the missing explorers come all the way here?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d Viola looked down at the ground. There was a dry patch in the middle of the soil and mud. \u201cThere are footprints.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Jermi smiled by himself, fascinated.\u2019Even though she has a talent for violence, she refused to become a Black Verratoux and instead claimed the position of the White Verratoux, which is perceived to be weaker. I think I understand a little bit as to why now.\u2019He found the mobile gate in an instant and did not miss any minor clues on the ground.[Can you find me?]Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsite[Look for me][I\u2019ll be waiting]Small balls of fire flew everywhere, like gigantic fireflies brightening their surroundings.\u201cThere\u2019s a long passage. Do you want to go? Is it raining?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Viola recalled the contents of the novel.As he had passed through the dark and long passage, Jermi fell into the fantasy of the spirits without realizing it. According to the novel, spirits didn\u2019t do it out of malice, but more out of mischief, but there were indeed cases where people couldn\u2019t escape from the fantasy and died.Jermi had been in a fantasy for a week and subsequently fell into a coma. If it were an ordinary person, he would have already died of dehydration. However, being the exceptional specimen that he was, he was able to come to his senses despite his severe condition.In fact, his extreme hunger and thirst were what broke him out of the illusion.Spirits probably didn\u2019t understand why the people died, since they don\u2019t need food and drink for sustenance. To put it in other words, humans were like frogs who died from skipping stones.\u2019I can\u2019t hear the spirit\u2019s voice now.\u2019Viola and Jermi kept walking, the passage narrowing and darkening and the fireballs growing scarce.\u201cViola, give me your hand.\u201d\u201cHand?\u201d\u201cYeah, because it\u2019s too dark. Let\u2019s hold hands and go.\u201dIt seemed wise.His hands were bigger than she had thought. Was it because her own hands were so small compared to seventeen-year-old Jermi\u2019s?\u201cJermi, do you remember the fantasy magic of the spirits beyond the gate?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s highly likely that the spirits here have another magic trap.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201dShe should\u2019ve said something earlier, she realized, but she knew Jermi would do just fine.A little relieved, Viola walked for a long time holding Jermi\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat do you think? Can you hear another voice?\u201d\u201cNo. I can\u2019t hear anything,\u201d she replied, then flinched at the sudden cacophony that ensued.It sounded like dozens of people were talking at once.Male voices. Female voices. Adult voices. Young voices. All kinds of voices.[Why are you here?][You can\u2019t be here.][What\u2019s your real name?]Viola trembled.Real name. Viola\u2019s real name was Han Arin.The voices came faster and faster.[What is Korea?][Han Arin, who are you?]It felt like she was trapped in a storm inside. This fantasy world was a place where witch hunts often took place.Korea? Han Arin? A different world?\u2018If this is revealed\u2026\u2019She would be beheaded for defaming Verratoux\u2019s honor and prestige.The voices crescendoed again, picking up on her fear.[Yes. Your neck might be cut off.][Why are you here?]Viola tried to tell them to be quiet, but it felt like there was a boulder on her chest and throat[What is Kang Hanjun?][Is your dog Kang Hanjun?]A giggle.[Where is Kang Han-jun?]The laughter intensified.[Wow! What is a car accident?][What is an emergency room?]Jermi was immediately alert when Viola first started shaking. He knew there was no way it was because she was nervous about them holding hands, so it must have been something else.\u2019Wouldn\u2019t it be embarrassing if I pointed it out?\u2019However, he could feel cold sweat bead on her hand.\u201cViola?\u201dIt was dark, the last fireball completely consumed. He couldn\u2019t even sense Xenon, who had been following them from a few paces behind.\u2018If I hadn\u2019t held Viola\u2019s hand\u2026\u2019If that had been the case, then she might have disappeared as well. For that, he was glad they were holding hands.By now, her body was trembling like aspen leaves.Jermi pondered for a long time before opening his mouth, \u201cViola, are you alright?\u201dEven then, he wondered if his question would hurt her pride. Still, he was worried about her, suddenly afraid of this inescapable darkness, this feeling of loss that he had never felt before.\u201cViola, are you okay?\u201dA soft groan escaped her mouth. It sounded pained.He grabbed her shoulder and shook it, but there was no response. His anxiety spiked.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dNo answer.\u201cViola!\u201dSomething strange happened to Jermi at that moment.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This felt uncanny, like an unseen blade hurtling towards them.\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you die like this, I\u2019ll be resentful for the rest of my life.\u201dJermi then realized that Viola was talking to someone else.\u2019A vision?\u2019She seemed to be hallucinating, witnessing the death of someone precious.Did someone who was precious to Viola die?Her slender shoulders were shaking strongly. She seemed stronger than anyone else, but he felt her shudder as if her body was going to break.\u201cI won\u2019t die. Please. Open your eyes.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t beg you to buy me pork cutlets.\u201dI won\u2019t bother you. Just, please open your eyes, please.\u201d Jermi realized what was happening.As her spirit affinity was extremely high, she seemed to be vulnerable to the fantasies shown by the spirits. Her powerful bloodline was a double-edged sword.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Viola. I\u2019m not dead.\u201d He patted Viola on the back, firmly believing that she would be able to pull through.\u2018What I can do now is\u2026 hold her and try to help her out.\u201dIt was surprising.Jermi never could have imagined that Viola would have a weakness like this.Who did she miss so much? Who was the enemy that she feared so much?His thoughts became a little complicated.Didn\u2019t she say that she was found in the slums? Did her parents perhaps abandon her?It was said that she had stabbed a slave trader with a shard of glass on the day Duke Verratoux adopted her.\u2018It\u2019s not about being abandoned.\u2019Hearing Viola\u2019s sobs, it didn\u2019t seem like she had been abandoned. If anything, it seemed that the person she was telling not to die was her parent.She might have been looking at her mom or dad at this moment.His heart felt a pang. Seven-year-old Jermi once had a crush on a girl. He went out to the Svon Street intersection every evening to meet her. The girl was blind, and that was where she made a living.Clink.A coin fell into her tin.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI have to go.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saving my pocket money and giving it to you.\u201dHe kept his word, and each time, the girl bowed and repeatedly thanked him.Six months thus passed.\u201cCan\u2019t you say anything other than thank you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dHe had always been dissatisfied, wanting to hear more. Frustrated, Jermi introduced himself only then, \u201cMy name is Jermi.\u201d At this time, he was very nervous. Excited and overwhelmed even though he was just giving his name. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a mom or dad?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThey threw me away.\u201dJermi learned for the first time that there were parents who coldly abandoned their children. His heart hurt for her.After a year, he knew that her name was Maelan and that she was the same age as him.\u201cWhy are you so nice to me?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201dFilled with youthful innocence, he hadn\u2019t quite understood that he liked Maelan, so he couldn\u2019t say anything else.\u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re friends,\u201d he decided to say.Maelan smiled brightly at the word friend. It was the first time he\u2019d seen her smile like that. \u201cFriend. That\u2019s a good thing to hear.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cThen stop following me now.\u201dMaelan, who turned eight, learned to polish shoes, and was able to earn for her own living expenses. She didn\u2019t have to beg anymore. That day, the two fought for the first time.Jermi got mad at her for refusing when he said he would give her some money, and Maelan shouted that she was no longer a beggar.That night, on a soft bed, Jermi bit his lips. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed.\u201dNo matter how much he thought about it, he couldn\u2019t tell what he did wrong.The nanny\u2019s words came to mind.\u201cIt\u2019s not annoying, it\u2019s heartbreaking, young master.\u201dAfter an hour, then two hours, he still couldn\u2019t sleep. The sound of grass bugs, which usually sounded like a lullaby, kept bothering me.\u201cI have to apologize tomorrow.\u201dJermi wasn\u2019t truly aware yet of what he did wrong, but it didn\u2019t matter. All he knew was that Maelan was sad, and he had to fix it.Early the next morning, he stepped out to the Svon intersection, but she wasn\u2019t there.A day passed. Then two.Jermi became more and more impatient.After three days, he heard that a group of robbers had attacked the slums. The guards of the Storm Fortress were heavily reprimanded, and an investigation was launched. An undercurrent of fury filled the air.Only then did he learn that his friend had been kidnapped by slave merchants.\u201cPlease take me with you, dad!\u201d he cried, but to no avail.His father said that it was because it wasn\u2019t safe for him, being nine years old, but really, it was because he felt too strongly about the matter.\u201cCalm down and go into your room to meditate.\u201d\u201cThis is a job for adults.\u201dJermi was locked alone in a room for three days. And after a long time, he was able to hear from Maelan.She no longer lived in this world.Listless, he refused to come out of the room for a week.Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsiteMeanwhile, a conversation with the nanny rekindled a fire in Jermi.\u201cThere are many Maelans in this world.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? There\u2019s only one Maelan.\u201d\u201cEven in places with good security, such as the Storm Fortress, terrible things like this happen.Similar things happen countless times in this world.\u201dThe second Maelan, the third Maelan, and the fourth Maelan. There were many Maelans in this world.\u201cThe young master has strength.\u201dHe had inherited the blood of the storm sword, and he had already shown the qualities of an outstanding warrior.People also called Jermi a small storm.\u201cThose who have power enjoy a lot and live. You have to use that power for the weak.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dBecause that\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s justice.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t it be hard?\u201d\u201cWhat if many people felt the same way?\u201d\u201cThen the world would be sad.\u201d\u201cA nobleman\u2019s duty is to protect others from that feeling.\u201dJermi definitely felt it. Shocked that he would no longer be able to see Maelan agan, he made up his mind.He would do his best to prevent another such tragedy from happening.When a year passed by, Jermi took a sword and vowed in front of the tomb where Maelan\u2019s remains were buried.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you.\u201dSince that day, Jermi had not shown any mercy to slave merchants. As soon as he found one, he killed him right then and there. As his reputation grew, Jermi was called the \u201cRelentless Storm\u201d.He recalled the old days as he watched Viola in his arms. He didn\u2019t forgive slave traders and parents who abandoned their children. In fact, he considered it his responsibility to ensure justice regarding those matters.Viola\u2019s words kept ringing in his ears.\u201cDon\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cIf you die like this, I\u2019ll be resentful for the rest of my life.\u201dJermi had only ever seen Viola\u2019s brilliance, her luck at being adopted by a powerful man.Now, his perspective had changed. He berated himself for not thinking about her life before.Had she not stabbed a slave merchant to death at seven years old? Had she not wandered around the slums at that time?Why did she have to fight on her own?\u2018There must have been no one to protect you.\u2019If there was someone to protect her, Maelan might not have ended up the way she did.The only difference was that Viola had been able to kill the slave trader. Still, if she had been protected by an adult, she wouldn\u2019t have had to hold the shard herself.\u201cit\u2019s okay,\u201d he soothed.\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Viola. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d He patted Viola on the back.She hugged him a little tighter, and he did the same.\u201cWhat you see is an illusion.\u201dViola didn\u2019t hear that, though. In her head were ambulance siren sounds. Doctors in white robes running around busily. Paramedics in orange clothes. People shouting urgently in unfamiliar terms.And Kang Hanjun covered in blood.It was cold and scary. It didn\u2019t look like he would make it.Then, warmth. She felt something hugging her tightly, protectively.It was a warmth that she had never felt since she became Viola Verratoux.\u201cYou were deceived by the fantasies of the spirits because you have too high an affinity with them. No one died. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m next to you.\u201dJermi made a resolution to not leave her side.\u201cYou can overcome it, Viola.\u201dIt was so dark that he couldn\u2019t see her face. Somehow, he was able to make eye contact.\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201dViola didn\u2019t have to fight alone anymore.At that time, she lost her parents and lived in a slum, but now she was Verratoux\u2019s princess, and she had him too.\u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201dViola\u2019s fantasies gradually began to subside.Even a small voice was heard.[Stop, guys.][If you keep playing around, we\u2019ll disappear.]The playful illusions had a fatal flaw. Sincerity.[What\u2019s with him?][Our bodies are going to break.]The spirits could no longer play tricks.Jermi\u2019s sincerity and desire broke the illusions of spirits. Before she knew it, Viola regained peace.Quietly.Actually, she fell asleep.Jermi sat still and patted Viola on the shoulder. \u201cGood night.\u201dThe illusion seemed to be broken. When she wakes up, she would be Viola Verratox again. Not the little girl who lost her parents, but an iron-blooded princess.Footsteps arrived.\u201cSo\u2026\u201dJermi was very nervous.Viola, who had yet to wake up, was carefully laid down.He pulled out a sword. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is Korea?\u201dWords that Jermi could not understand continued.\u201cThen, you\u2019re Kang Hanjun?\u201d\u201d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you a human being? You can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dIt was strange. It had eyes, but there were no signs of life within them. It felt like a ghost.\u201cI\u2019m a spirit.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing a spirit,\u201d Jermi said curiously.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing a human being, too.\u201dThe spirit headed for Viola. As she had already come to her senses, she felt her heart pounding.\u2019Korea. And Kang Hanjun. That spirit knows about me.\u2019Did it go through the spirit gate? What if it became known that she came from another world and occupied the body of Viola?She might be hunted as a witch. Xenon didn\u2019t even seem to be around, which meant he was probably wandering somewhere.At least the spirit didn\u2019t know everything about her. If it had to ask what Korea was and if Jermi was Kang Hanjun, then it didn\u2019t know everything.Viola\u2019s heart became lighter.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true.\u201dViola took out the dagger and approached the spirit.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a spirit who passed the spirit gate without signing a contract with a human being, right?\u201d She walked without hesitation and grabbed the boy in the back of his head and put the dagger to his neck.The boy struggled, but could not overcome Viola\u2019s grip. \u201cLet me go! I\u2019m going to get angry!\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do? Uncontracted spirits lose most of their power as they pass through the spirit gate.\u201d\u201cWait, what?\u201d\u201cHe seems to have passed through the gate out of curiosity.\u201dThe boy continued struggling futilely.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of it, but this dagger is a magic weapon made at Verratoux\u2019s special production workshop.\u201d She pressed it lightly on the boy\u2019s neck. \u201cMagic weapons can also hurt the spirit\u2019s body.\u201dThe spirit swallowed nervously. Anyone could see that he was scared.\u201cSo you\u2019d better stop thinking about playing tricks by peeking at other people\u2019s memories.\u201d Viola squinted her eyes and sent her mana into him just as he had done. She began to glow.And then he began to hiccup. Young spirits tended to hiccup when they felt extreme fear.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t even claim that the distorted things you saw in your dreams are my memories.\u201d\u201cBut the people in white gowns in something with four wheels that makes a loud noise\u2026\u201d\u201cI had a similar dream.\u201d I put the dagger closer.The spirit\u2019s body trembled, mana pulsing. \u201cRight. A dream.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cYeah. I think I heard my sister tell me that dream. Let me go.\u201dViola held firmly onto the dagger.\u201cWhen are you going to let go of my head?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf I let you go, you\u2019ll run away.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t run away.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Still, she did not let go.\u201cYou agreed. Why didn\u2019t you let me go?\u201d\u201cYou just said that you wouldn\u2019t run.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 Then let me go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe back of your head is cute.\u201dThe more the spirit spoke, the more he felt like he was falling into a deep abyss.Viola asked, \u201cWhat kind of place is this? Why are spirits staying here?\u201dJermi walked with his hand on his chin. At that point, he thought they could let go of the spirit, but Viola didn\u2019t want to, which was a bit shocking.He knew nothing about the spirits except that they existed. Viola, on the other hand, was impressively knowledgeable. Furthermore, she was even able to use it to her advantage.\u2019How does she know all this?\u2019She was really amazing at being a White Verratoux.\u201cSo, Spirit. Where are we going?\u201d\u201cThis historical site is the lab of someone called Gavgol, a wizard and spirit.\u201d\u201cCan you practice magic as a spirit?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what he said. I don\u2019t know either.\u201dWe walked along the dark passage. Jermi couldn\u2019t feel the pulse of the hostile energy from earlier.How long had they been walking?\u201cTa-da.\u201dLight suddenly flooded them.\u2019A room? No. Is it a lab?\u2019Various potions and books littered the space. There was a large desk and a magic circle in front of them. It smelled damp and vaguely chemical inside.Jermi found something amazing. \u201cWow. That centipede is huge.\u201dA centipede was seen running away in search of shade. It was as big as a human\u2019s forearm.Viola almost freaked out. \u201cAh!\u201dEven if the centipede was big, it was too big. She\u2019d never seen such a big bug. Honestly, she wanted to cry.But Jermi took another step. \u201cShould I grab it? It\u2019s my first time seeing such a big centipede. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d\u201cStop it.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why?\u201dDuh.Please support our website and read on wuxiaworldsiteBecause centipedes were scary. Everything with more than four legs was scary.\u201cThis is a historic site. It\u2019s better not to be frivolous. Each small element can be a trap and a danger.\u201dReally?Jermi smacked his lips as if he was disappointed. It was a pity that he couldn\u2019t catch the centipede.He still looked like he wanted to go after it, so Viola hurriedly said, \u201cThis is Gavgol\u2019s lab, right?\u201d\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d the spirit replied. \u201cThe back of my head hurts. When are you going to let me go?\u201dShe didn\u2019t mean to let go. In the original work, Jermi\u2019s colleague Nadia, who came here with him, held the spirit\u2019s hair until the end.\u201cWhat kind of research did you do here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know because I was just born.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d Viola looked around. \u201cI don\u2019t think the conditions are very favorable for the door to open.\u201d\u201cOh? Viola, there are favorable conditions for the door to open?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSpirit gates usually opened where the energy of nature was plentiful. Deep in the forest, where there is a lake, the sunlight is warm, and the soil is alive. It would have been a place rich in mana stones and mana crystals, as well as a strong wind.At the same time, it had to have a special topography in which mana could flow into one place and accumulate.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t meet any conditions. So, that must be a magic circle that can artificially open the spirit door.\u201dBoth Jermi and the spirit nodded.\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cWow. I see too. Argh. The back of my head! Don\u2019t hurt my skin.\u201d\u201cSpirit, you didn\u2019t know either?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know either. I told you. I\u2019m a new spirit.\u201d\u201cHow do you know, Viola?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jermi\u2019s interest was piqued. He thought that he was glad to come with Viola. \u201cAs expected, it\u2019s fun to play with a smart person.\u201dViola was surprised. That was very similar to what the original Jermi had said to his colleague Nadia here.There was just a small difference. He said \u201cplay\u201d for Viola, and \u201cgo\u201d for Nadia.It was very subtly different from the original.\u201cSo I think that magic circle plays a role in opening the spirit door and forcibly increasing spirit affinity. This was a laboratory that conducted such research.\u201d\u201cThen, with that magic circle, is it possible to make a contract with a spirit even if one\u2019s spirit affinity is low?\u201d\u201cI think so, if the research was successful.\u201d\u201cIf it was successful, shouldn\u2019t it be known to the world?\u201dIf there was a way for even people with low affinity to sign a contract with a spirit, the world would greatly welcome that method.\u201cNo. You have to think the other way around. There\u2019s a lot of things we don\u2019t understand in the world.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWould you welcome the increasing number of spirits from a different world?\u201dMagic was a study that pursued convenience by artificially processing the energy of nature.Spirit techniques sought convenience by borrowing the power of spirits to supplement natural energy.The two were conflicting disciplines.\u201cThe wizards don\u2019t want more spirits.\u201dAnd since ancient times, wizards had been powerful people.\u201cSo this must have been secretly studied here.\u201d\u201cIs that the way things are going?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis reasoning was all said by Nadia. Viola only recited the contents of the novel.However, Jermi did not know that.\u201cWhy are you so cool?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Jermi laughed.It was fun to be with Viola. Not only that, but she also broadened his perspectives. How much more amazing could the world be?\u201cYou were able to infer all of that by combining the clues here.\u201dViola felt the wind blowing. This was a blocked room on all sides, which meant there was no room for wind.\u2019The Spirit of the Wind\u2019Perhaps the spirit door was a little open. It was like the novel. When Jermi and Nadia arrived here, it was expressed that the spirit door was slightly open.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time. The spirit door is not open for a long time. You have to hurry.\u201dEven Viola felt the urgency. This was the right time.It was an opportunity to open the spirit gate and proceed with a proper contract with the spirit.Viola strode toward the markings on the floor. She stood in front of the magic circle, but nothing changed. However, when I stood in the middle of the magic circle, the spirit she was holding was invigorated.\u201cNo!\u201dThe spirit shook off Viola\u2019s hand. The power from the spirit gate seemed to have partially restored his power.\u201cJermi. Overpower him.\u201dFortunately, it went the same as the novel. Jermi moved quickly. His sword was also a great sword in the Battle of the Mages, and it was not very difficult to overpower the spirit.\u201cQuick, Brother. Help me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t kill you.\u201dViola told Jermi to overpower him, so it was enough to overpower him.He laughed and said, \u201cHe\u2019s more amazing than a centipede. Of course I can\u2019t kill him.\u201dThen he kept his thoughts on dissecting the spirit to himself because he didn\u2019t want to get scolded.Viola said, \u201cFive vertices.\u201dA star-shaped figure inscribed within the circle. There was a recessed space at each vertex.\u201cI think I know what to do.\u201d She moved quickly and grabbed a handful of things that were scattered around.She touched the magic torch on the wall and saw that a red bead of energy gathered in her hand. When she touched the stagnant water on the floor, this time, the energy in the shape of a blue bead gathered in Viola\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u2018When Viola touched the steel magic staff on the wall, then gold beads\u2026She touched the wooden bookshelf, a reddish-brown bead was formed.Finally, when she touched the soil on the floor, a soil-colored bead was formed.\u201cFive beads?\u201dViola put the beads one by one at each point of the star. Hollows sucked in the beads like black holes, and at the same time, something amazing began to happen.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Spirits naturally had names from the moment they were born. Those born with the surname \u2018Kell\u2019 were very special.[What\u2019s your last name?][My last name is Kell][Wow, is it really?]Spirits celebrated the birth of a new Kell.[Then, will you be the king of the spirits when you grow up?][Of course.][What kind of Spirit King do you want to be?][I\u2019m going to be a great, powerful, and wonderful Spirit King.]While his surname was indeed promising, many were worried about his given name.[But your name is Veron?][Yes. Kell-Veron][I don\u2019t feel good about the name Veron.][Veron is a demon name.]There were several names considered taboo among spirits, one of which was Veron. It was the name of a high-ranking demon who slaughtered spirits in the Demon War a long time ago.It felt like an ill omen.[The successor of the Kell line of noble spirits has the name Veron?][Aren\u2019t you going to become the terrible Blood Spirit King?]The newborn spirit could feel it. The spirit world was not the place for him, and so he wanted to escape the fear and hatred from his peers.Just in time, he saw the spirit door, and Kell-Veron threw himself out of it without any hesitation.[I\u2019m going to be a great Spirit King!]Sadly, no spirit threw their support behind Kell-Veron. He wasn\u2019t saddened, though. He felt more motivated.But then he felt a girl approach him. At first, he was curious about her. In his perspective, which was quite a bit different from how humans saw things, she looked like a friendly giant.He decided to play tricks on her. Kell-Veron tried to read her memories and show her an illusion.[Ugh!]However, Kell-Veron could not control his body. There seemed to be a huge inhalation spell, and he was trapped in the girl\u2019s mind. Her spirit affinity was so high that even he was sucked in.[Sa-save me!]To survive, he had to break the girl\u2019s mindscape, or at least make a small gap in it. He searched for the weakest part.[This is it!]Korea. Traffic accident. Emergency room. Kang Hanjun.In fact, he didn\u2019t know what those were, but he had to manage it somehow.[I\u2019m Kell-Veron, only eight hours old!]Someone who would eventually become the Spirit King could not die just like that. He had to live.He was a little afraid of the girl who looked like a giant, but he didn\u2019t show it outwardly.But it was really scary when the dagger touched his neck. He felt like he was going to be sucked into that terrifying world again. In the end, Kell-Veron guided Viola as he was told.\u2019This is so disgraceful.\u2019She was holding him by the back of his head. He, who would become a great Spirit King in the future, felt as if his hair would be pulled out.\u2019We\u2019ll see about that!\u2019When he regained a bit of his power, he\u2019d make her suffer! And it did, and he tried to scold the girl, but he was overpowered by the boy accompanying them, Jermi.What?Jermi\u2019s spirit affinity was low, so Kell-Veron didn\u2019t pay much attention to him, but now he was also giant-like. This seemed to be something humans could do with their mana.\u201cStay still. Tsk, don\u2019t make more trouble, okay?\u201dThe spirit stood still, pretending to be calm.His eyes were on Jeremy\u2019s sword. Humans\u2019 magic weapons were very scary, so he had to endure.Then the magic circle was activated, the staves emitting colorful lights. Kell-Veron\u2019s confidence spiked along with his power and energy. He felt the strongest he\u2019d ever been.[I\u2019ll make you pay for this! You two will pay for grabbing the back of the head of a Spirit King! Bwahahaha!]He\u2019d show them his power now.\u201cA Spirit King, huh?\u201d[Ehhhh?] Kell-Veron felt like he was being sucked into something again.Being young, he didn\u2019t know what happened around humans with incredibly high spirit affinities.***Various lights emanated from the magic circle. Viola wasn\u2019t surprised because she had read a lot of novels in her past life, and was also used to modern colorful lighting from that time as well. Instead, she was rather annoyed.What was the spirit saying? It didn\u2019t sound right because the mana in the area was so strong. It just sounded like a baby\u2019s babbling.\u201cHmm? What is this?\u201dAs if attracted by a magnet, the blue-haired spirit was dragged forward.[My name is Kell-Veron. Do you want to sign a contract with me?]Viola tilted her head. The spirit\u2019s speech was awkward and strange. Stilted. Like the words were being forced out of him.\u201cA contract? So suddenly?\u201d\u201cDo you want to sign a contract with me?\u201dPlease support our website and read on wuxiaworldsiteShe paused, thinking of where she had heard \u2018Kell-Veron\u2019 before.\u2019Kell-Veron?\u2019Viola raised her head and looked. Blue hair and blue eyesWait\u2026Kell-Veron. He was very famous, or rather infamous, for his mercilessness. Appearing in the second half of the novel, the spirit protected Hyde, one of the main villains.\u2018Water Spirit King?\u2019The empire issued an arrest because of the numerous crimes that Hyde had committed, and they had indeed been captured several times.But no mage could attack Hyde with weapons, magical or not, because Kell-Veron was there.\u2019This is him?\u2019Viola smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201dAt that, Kell-Veron seemed quite embarrassed.Why was it so easy to sign a contract? He wanted to be able to scold her first!In fact, he was still afraid of Viola. When he was stuck in her mindscape and floundering, he thought he was drowning. It feels so unfamiliar and scary to a water spirit.If he signed a contract with Viola, he might feel that again, the feeling of being trapped in a deep sea.\u201cI-I\u2019ll confirm again. Are you really going to sign a contract?\u201dHe seemed strangely reluctant.\u201cOf course, I like Kell-Veron.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHe would become the Spirit King in the future and protect the one he was contracted to.\u201cCan\u2019t I make a deal with you?\u201d[Me? I tried to attack you by digging into your weaknesses.]\u201cThere must have been a good reason.\u201dWhatever it was, Kell-Veron offered the contract first, and she wasn\u2019t planning on missing the opportunity and regretting it.[Do you really think so?]\u201cOf course.\u201d Viola smiled.Jermi was a little confused by the entire exchange. Viola\u2019s smile didn\u2019t seem like a mask. He scratched his head, wondering why she smiled so sincerely at Kell-Veron.As someone who wanted to get close to her, he seriously pondered.\u2019Do I have to dye my hair blue? Will she like it if I do that?\u2019In a word, his thoughts were a mess.\u201cLet\u2019s sign a contract, Kell-Veron.\u201dShhh\u2014The spirit\u2019s body melted. Or more precisely, it became like a water drop that enveloped Viola\u2019s body.It was surprisingly cozy, like being in a spa. It was warm and pleasant and she could still breathe. What was it? She couldn\u2019t even see Jermi.[Yes\u2026 your contract with me has been completed.]Viola couldn\u2019t hold back her curiosity. \u201cWhy are you trembling? If you sign a contract, you can exert your full power as a spirit.\u201d[That\u2019s true, but\u2026] The water took the shape of a boy. [In any case, our contract is binding, and I\u2019ve become your guardian spirit.]\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Viola reached out her hand as if to shake hands.Kell-Veron\u2026 moved back with a roar, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Men and women can\u2019t hold hands.\u201d\u201cSpirits have gender?\u201dKell-Veron was speechless at the moment. He definitely didn\u2019t, and that made him more afraid. How did Viola\u2019s influence do that? He was even thinking of himself in a masculine style.This was all because of her ridiculously high spirit affinity!He touched upon the memory of Kang Hanjun because it was the weakest part of her mentality, but because that person was male, he absorbed that characteristic.The memory has also had a tremendous impact on Kell-Veron.Kell-Veron regretted it.\u2019What\u2019s wrong with this person\u2026? I should have just run away immediately, but instead\u2026\u2019He had even confronted her because he thought he had to overcome his fears as someone who would become the Spirit King.But that was a big mistake. Kell-Veron couldn\u2019t get out of it now. If he did something wrong, he would likely be sucked into his contractor\u2019s mental world and suffer.Meanwhile, Viola, now his contractor, could sense that fear. She didn\u2019t know exactly what he was afraid of, but he was definitely afraid.\u2018I need to fix it! Kell-Veron has to be a great guardian, just like he was for Hyde. For a happy and safe ending!\u2019\u201cKell-Veron.\u201dHow could she soothe the spirit? As a reader, she had ideas.\u201cWhy?
