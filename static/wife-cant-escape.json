This made the novel\u2019s success and swept the women\u2019s daily charts.Song Luan read more than two million words in that book with great interest. After reading half of them, her upper and lower eyelids were fighting to stay awake. When she couldn\u2019t bare it anymore, she went to sleep.When she woke up, she found that she transmigrated in that book as the man\u2019s wife.The original owner of the body did not have much details in the book. She only appeared a few chapters, and even faced a tragic ending. She was burned to death by a fire set off by her husband while her son locked the door.When Song Luan thought of this, her mood was not good.\u201cMadam, it\u2019s time\u201d The servant girl spoke carefully and bowed her body with her head down. She was afraid of her.Song Luan sighed heavily and cleared her throat. She said, \u201cGo out first, you don\u2019t have to wait for me\u201dThe two servant girls that were told to go out, bent over and quickly retreated out of the room.Song Luan knew why they were afraid of her. The original owner deserved to end up with a terrible death.Her father was a powerful man in front of the emperor. He is highly favored prime minister. Although the original owner\u2019s mother was a concubine, she was pampered and raised since she was young.She learned a lot of spoiled traits from her mother. She treated people harshly, was snobbish to make friends, and often insulted women in the circle with her beauty.However, the original owner is quite beautiful with white skin and big chest, that even all the nobles want to marry her.At that time, the male lead had just won the imperial examination and visited the Hanlin Academy, and came to visit the Song family.The original owner was plotted by her sister, and the two were drugged to stay in the same bed. This kind of scandal would damage the reputation of the two families. Since they have no choice, the two families had to get married.She was already dissatisfied with this marriage, and after being mocked by the sisters she had bullied before, she was even more dissatisfied!After she got married, she grew more angry towards the Zhao\u2019s family. She scolded her servants at will, and disliked her husband, Zhao Nanyu. But soon after, she was pregnant with a child.Of course, the woman can only see money in her eyes. She was extremely displeased with her son. As long as Zhao Nanyu is not at home, she scolds her child whenever she\u2019s in a bad mood. She can still choke him with anger.The original owner was bold enough to hook up with the royal family. Zhao Nanyu ignored her words and deeds, and this made her even more unscrupulous.After thinking of these things, Song Luan\u2019s brow wrinkled tightly.She got out of bed and dressed, went outside to wash herself. Sitting in front of the bronze mirror, Song Luan was still in a trance. Her face was the same as the female character in the book. When she read the book, she felt very happy when the original owner died. But now, she couldn\u2019t laugh anymore.Speaking of Zhao Nanyu, although he was still a nameless man. This made him no choice but to be humble. His lifestyle is low-key and gentle, and he is kind and gentle to everyone.But in reality, he is a vicious character.Hiding a knife in his smile, he gradually removes obstacles in his career. He smiles right after killing them personally. Everyone who humiliated and insulted him had to die.Zhao Nanyu is also extremely vengeful. At the age of five or six, he did not let go of his servants who bullied him.Such a vengeful man who can\u2019t kill without blood naturally won\u2019t give a good end to the original owner who betrayed him and nearly made him wear a green hat.He rose to the top, controlling the regime and covering the world with his hands.The servants buried their heads and started to prepare the dishes. It\u2019s time for lunch. Song Luan glanced at the dishes on the table. There were several kinds of light vegetables, a crystal clear elbow, and a bowl of west lake beef soup, which makes people hungry.Song Luan swallowed her breath and gradually felt hungry.She sat on the chair, picked up the chopsticks and took a bite of her favorite spring bamboo shoots, which tasted delicious that she unconsciously ate two more bites.The servant girl standing on the side was quavering. After a long internal struggle, she stood out and said, \u201cMadam, I\u2019m afraid the young master is too weak to eat two meals.\u201dSong Luan was shocked, \u201cWhat?\u201dSeeing that her face was fair, the servant girl boldly continue, \u201cHave you forgotten? yesterday morning, you fined young master not to eat for a day. Last night, he was hungry. I\u2019m afraid he can\u2019t be hungry again this morning.\u201dAfraid that she would not agree, the servant girl moved closer, \u201cI\u2019m afraid master will lose his temper if he hears about this.\u201dZhao Nanyu loved this child so much.Song Luan didn\u2019t know about this! Needless to say, before she transmigrated, it is certain that the original owner already did petty things, not even sparing her own biological son.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He is four years old. Most of the time, he lives in the front yard with his father. Only when Zhao Nanyu is away from home will he be sent to the backyard.Song Luan suddenly lost her appetite and put down her chopsticks, \u201cGo and bring my son\u201dThe servant girl was surprised and pleased, but for fear that she would change her mind, \u201cYes, I will go\u201dZhao Nanyu was sent out to leave Beijing a few days ago, and spent more than a half a month away. As a matter of fact, he was coming back in two days. Thinking that she was about to meet the man, Song Luan\u2019s heart is still shaking when she thinks of meeting him soon. She doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late to please him now. After all, he would be a very powerful man in the future.If she can\u2019t please him, at least she should not offend him.The servant soon led a little boy to the inner room. The spring was cold, but Shi Ge\u2019s clothes were very thin. He was wearing a red round-neck shirt, and also had a pair of red boots under his feet. His skin was white as now, his eyes were dark and deep. By the time he arrived in the room, he released the servant\u2019s hand expressionlessly and refused to let her hold it again.Shi Ge lowered his eyebrows and walked to Song Luan respectfully, paying his respect, \u201cMother is well.\u201dZhao Shi\u2019s facial features follow his parents. There is no flaw in them. He\u2019s beautiful just like the ice and snow. Song Luan has never seen a better looking child in her life. Perhaps since he is still young and has some flesh on his cheeks that it made him look especially cute and lovely.It\u2019s just that his body and bones look thinner than those of his age, making people want to love and cuddle him.Song Luan looked as if she wanted to reach out for a hug, but was afraid that she would scare the child, so she tried to pull up a gentle smile and said to him, \u201cAre you hungry? would you like to eat together?\u201dHe seemed to be stunned for awhile, his mouth was stretched tightly and his brow furrowed. After a while, he replied politely, \u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan, as a single young woman in her youth, had no experience with children or how to get along with them, but she still understands the principle of step-by-step. She stretched out her chopsticks to pick up a crystal elbow for Shi ge, \u201cThis is delicious\u201dThen she looked at him with bright eyes.Shi Ge felt strange for awhile. He felt that his mother today was different. He lowered his head, \u201cThank you, mother\u201dThe mother and son sat at the table in silence. After Song Luan was full, she quietly looked at him and found that the crystal elbow in his bowl remain untouched.Song Luan was discouraged. It seems that their mother-child relationship is worse than she thought.After eating enough, servants immediately pulled out the dishes and chopsticks on the table. The three-year old son sat down on the spot with a straight-face and said nothing.Song Luan sighed in her heart. She suddenly reached out to him, this action scared Shi Ge. He leaned back and almost fell to the ground. Fortunately, Song Luan caught him quickly.She hugged the child in her arms and caressed his back with her delicate hands. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dZhao Shi twisted his eyebrows and looked serious. At first, he thought he would hate the light fragrance on her. Unexpectedly, he found that the smell of his mother was a little pleasant and warm, as if it could make people feel at ease.Song Luan didn\u2019t get a response. She looked up and down at him, and found that there was a wound on his arm and a small scratch on his forehead. She estimated that these were all the things that the original owner did.She really can\u2019t figure out how could the original owner treat such a lovely child like this? Starving him? Blistering his son?She opened her mouth and was about to say something when a servant came from outside and said, \u201cMadam, the little master\u2019s teacher is here. It\u2019s time to practice.\u201dShi Ge returned to his senses and freed himself from her arms, \u201cMother, I\u2019ll go to my uncle first.\u201dHis teacher is his uncle.Song Luan couldn\u2019t stop him. She lowered her body and poked his cheeks with her finger, \u201cGo!\u201dShi Ge\u2019s face turned red, then returned to normal, and he retired from the room.After waiting for a long time, the young man picked him up and touched his head. He glanced at Huai Shui residence with cold eyes. He asked, \u201cDid your mother hit you today?\u201dShi Ge put his head on his shoulder and shook his head, \u201cNo\u201dHis face was a little childish, and his voice was not as cold as before, \u201cUncle, I think she is different today.\u201dShe smiled at him, gave him food, and even hugged him.The man sneered, \u201cShe must be thinking of doing something bad again.\u201dWhen Shi Ge heard the words, he lost a little bit in his eyes. He looked down, and his hands tied tightly around his neck. \u201cI miss my father\u201d\u201cHe will come back tonight.\u201dIn Zhao\u2019s residence, not only Shi Ge thought of his father, Zhao NanyuBut Song Luan also thought of this man. At first, after she was full, she laid on the soft bed to rest when she suddenly sat up like a fish and said, \u201cIt\u2019s over\u201dSong Luan suddenly remembered that the original owner in the book was not only burned to death, but Zhao Nanyu quietly began to give her chronic poison/medicine in the second year after their marriage, preparing to kill her.It\u2019s been three years since she was poisoned with drugs. She doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late to save herself now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She even read half of it without paying attention to these details.Although there is not much description of the original owner in the book, but the nature of this person was thoroughly described as vicious, rebellious, and unrestrained. Song Luan remembers that the original owner\u2019s body will get worse after a year, presumably related to the poison that the male lead fed her.After the original owner was sick for many years, the male lead\u2019s rank rose in court. He eventually controlled the affairs of the state, settling accounts one by one. The original owner was burned to death among the fate of others who had also insulted the male lead.Song Luan heard from the servant that the body fainted that day, and when she woke up, she became the owner of this body.She leaned against the soft cushion, the light of the noon fell on her cheek. She was white and translucent, her long eyelashes flickered a little, her red lips were glamorous. She was truly a beauty.Song Luan has a good figure\u2014small waist, long legs, and big chest. She was wearing a red tunic jacket with a full grip on the waist. Her watery eyes flow like the waves. She has the physical attributes to captivate people.However, the man was not moved by such beauty, he still killed her in the end.Song Luan thought about it for an afternoon but was not able to come up with a plan to deal with it. Later, she went to sleep slowly in the warm sun. The sun fell on her appropriately, and it made her look so peaceful.But she had a nightmare. In the dream, there was a man in black. His temperament was cold and his eyes were sharp as knives. There was a shallow smile on the extremely beautiful face. The curved peach blossom eyes narrowed slightly. The man held a dagger in his hands and walked closer to her step by step with his black boots.The man raised his hand and brutally stabbed the dagger in her heart by pressing his finger on her thin shoulder, pinning her to death on the wall. Soon after, he moved the knife and turned it all around, Song Luan could almost hear the splashing sound of blood on her flesh, and after a moment, her face turned white and the pain stopped.Then Song Luan woke up\u2026When she woke up, she found that it was almost dark and her forehead was sweating. She covered her chest and felt a little pain. Song Luan remembered that what she had just dreamed about was the scene before the death of the original owner that was described in the book. It was the man who stabbed her with the knife. It was so terrible.The original owner pleased the male lead after he gained power. After he failed, she became angry and lost her mind. She shouted at him, saying all kinds of ugly words.However, she shouldn\u2019t have scolded him with, \u201cYou are just a son of a lowly slut! You were just in a moment of power. You dare to give me that face!\u201dIt\u2019s true that the mother of the male lead was born in a humble background. She died of depression without even entering the Zhao family.The male lead stabbed the original owner and threw her into the fire.Song Luan secretly made a decision. She would never do anything to offend the male lead, and would not say anything that should not be said, and even would not dare to think about hooking up or attracting other men for him to not wear a green hat.In the end, the reason why the male lead used fire was because he thought the original owner was dirty. As the male lead in a novel with a female audience, overbearing is an attitude they have. Not just that, but they need to have both strong possessiveness and obsessive cleanliness. What belongs to him should not be touched and tainted by outsiders.At this time, she doesn\u2019t know how many men the original owner had ties with. She felt her eyes were stained at a glance. Only when these ashes are blown away by the wind could she be clean.As she was thinking about something, a servant girl came in and asked, \u201cMadam, do you want the meal to be set up?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face was white, and now she looked haggard. She was hungry, and so she nodded, \u201cSet the meal.\u201dAfter a pause, she suddenly stopped two servant girls and asked, \u201cDid master ever say when he\u2019d come back?\u201dShe had to be ready to deal with the man.The servant girl was shocked, and then she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAfraid that she would be angry, she immediately added, \u201cbut this servant heard from the housekeepers that he will probably arrive in Beijing tonight.\u201dSong Luan: \u201c\u2026.\u201dThis headache is getting worse\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise, she\u2019ll die.\u201cI see.\u201d Song Luan decided to tear this one by one. The older one was not easy to fool, but the four-year-old Zhao Shi should be very easy to coax. Suddenly, she said, \u201cGo to the front yard and bring the young master over for dinner.\u201d\u2026\u201cYes\u201d\u201cForget it. I\u2019ll go by myself.\u201dI\u2019m familiar with the layout of the residence.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s yard is not big, but his taste is not bad, which is better than any other artistic concept and layout out there. Through a path and a round door, she arrived at the front yard.The four-year old Zhao Shi was practicing calligraphy in the study room. As for his uncle, he left long ago. He was standing on a chair, holding a writing brush with a very professional posture. He writes decisively. His words are not beautiful, but they can also be described as neat and clear.Although his father dotes on him, he still has high requirements for the young master. He has to practice calligraphy and study every day. Zhao Shi has no friends to play with in the residence. His several cousins didn\u2019t like to play with him.Even his mother didn\u2019t like him. From her memory, she just beat or scolded this child. Zhao Shi never resisted. At the beginning, he was expecting his mother, but gradually, his heart became cold.Song Luan gently pushed the door open, and a smell of ink came into her nose, which made her feel relaxed and happy. She softly paced, and walked over. \u201cIs my son still practicing calligraphy?\u201dThe brush in Shi Ge\u2019s hand shook, the black ink stained the white paper, and the expression on his face was not natural, \u201cMother\u201dSong Luan cheekily walked to him, bent over and looked at the words he wrote, and praised sincerely, \u201cThe writing is really good.\u201dHe was uncomfortable, and the small hands in his sleeves were tightly held together. This was the first time his mother praised him. It had never happened before. There was a strange feeling of sweetness and sourness in her heart.Song Luan\u2019s eyes gazed at him with a gentle look, and after being watched for awhile, his face gradually rose red, and he asked, \u201cHow did my mother come?\u201dThe more Song Luan saw Shi Ge, the more she liked him. White, tender, and lovely. Even if the corners of his mouth were raised because of unhappiness, he was still cute. She reached out her hand and held him in her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s time to eat. I\u2019ll take you there\u201dShi Ge\u2019s body was stiff all over. His hands were too stiff that he doesn\u2019t know where to put them. He didn\u2019t dare to hold her clothes. He was even more afraid to hug her. He just felt her mother was fragrant and soft.It turned out that being held in the arms by his mother was comfortable, but he still didn\u2019t forget what uncle said to him in the afternoon. Uncle said that his mother was thinking about something bad again.\u201cI can walk by myself, mother.\u201dSong Luan hugged the small bun, she was not willing to let go, so she smiled and patted his head affectionately, \u201cDon\u2019t move around, put your arms around your mother\u2019s neck. The child should listen to what the mother says.\u201dHe was forced to bury his face in her chest. Five little fingers opened and closed, closed and opened. Finally, he couldn\u2019t keep up with his inner emotions, he carefully grasped her coat.Although his face was still very cold, but his pair of small ears had a tinge of light pink.Song Luan took Shi Ge back to the Huai Shui Residence. Fearing that the child was cold, she specially found him a coat to wear, with a collar covered with soft, warm fox fur. Most of the child\u2019s face was tucked inside, revealing only a pair of dark eyes, clear and bright.Zhao Shi felt that he was dreaming. His mother treated him too well today. She used to look at him full of disgust. Today, she does not, as if she really liked him.Even though this was a dream, Zhao Shi was still very happy.When the mother and son sat at the table, Song Luan realized that she didn\u2019t know what he liked to eat. This time, she didn\u2019t immediately take the food to his bowl, instead she asked, \u201cWhat do you like to eat? Tomorrow, I\u2019ll let them cook it for you\u201dZhao Shi was still very restrained, lowering his head, \u201cI can eat anything.\u201dSong Luan also saw that his defense was still high, so she did not force him to give an answer. With a gentle smile, she said, \u201cOkay\u201dShe wanted to say that she would cook pastries for him tomorrow, but the next day after, she didn\u2019t dare to collapse her character so much that someone would notice. It would be difficult if that happens.At night, after Song Luan finished washing, she dressed in a white long dress, her dark hair casually draped over her back. Her face looked at the night sky\u2014she was more exquisite than gorgeous.Zhao Shi had already gone to sleep in his room, he curled up while sleeping in the corner of the bed. Song Luan covered the quilt for him and stepped out the room.At this time, she was now tired physically and mentally. Just when she turned off the light to go to bed, the servant girl outside the room hurriedly came in and said, \u201cMadam, the master is back. He is coming here.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s drowsiness immediately died down. She was full awake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The male lead almost never set foot in the original owner\u2019s residence. If it\u2019s not necessary, he won\u2019t even appear in front of the original owner.Song Luan never thought that the male lead would come to her directly after coming back home. To be honest, she was a little nervous.Zhao Nanyu came back to his house, drank some water to moisten his throat. Then he went to his room to see his son. The room in the front yard was empty, and his eyes were cold. \u201cWhere is my son?\u201dThe young man replied trembling, \u201cYour wife took him this evening.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was even colder, and he took large steps towards the Huai Shui Residence. His anger was so strong that his heart felt crushed. His eyes darkened. She better not seek death.Song Luan thought about how to face him. Suddenly, the room was pushed open. She was shocked. She sat up from the bed and raised her eyes. The man in front of her was dressed in white, with a jade pendant hanging on his waist and a cloud pattern embroidered on his belt. Her eyes gradually moved up and looked at his face directly.The face was very delicate as if they had been carefully carved, with eyes that at first glance, looks like it was painted. The peach-blossom eyes seem to contain clear water. The corner of the eyes are slightly raised, and the casual glance at her added to the emotion.There was a faint light in his light-colored pupil. His eyes were deep, his skin was fair and the light of the candle fell on his elegant face like a painting.Song Luan swallowed her breath. This male lead is so beautiful.Zhao Nanny looked around slowly, chuckled and said, \u201cWhere is our eldest son?\u201dHe pretended to be such a good-tempered man.Song Luan was a little nervous and said, \u201cIn the room..\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. It seemed that today she is different from the ordinary times. This person seemed to be soft and quiet. Her eyes are clean and her expression is ignorant.He raised his eyebrows and remembered to ask the servant tomorrow about what happened while he was away.Song Luan was even more nervous when he didn\u2019t talk for a long time. Even though Zhao Nanyu was smiling, she could not smile back. After all, the nightmare left a big impression on her\u2014Zhao Nanyu was smiling as he inserted a dagger in her heart, which hurt her chest while thinking about it.She is frightened.Zhao Nanyu stared at her quietly, as if he found something interesting. The fragile and weak woman was afraid of him.She lightly bit her lips with her teeth, and her brows that furrowed were covered with fear while her eyes were overflowing with water. Zhao Nanyu doesn\u2019t know why but when he looked at her weak appearance, his eyes became dark.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, son is sleeping well in that room.\u201dZhao Nanyu removed his inquiry look and didn\u2019t ask her why she suddenly became nice to their son. He knew that Song Luan didn\u2019t like her child since the day she born him.Usually she wouldn\u2019t want to touch her child. How could she even let the son sleep in the same room as her?Zhao Nanyu usually takes care of their child to avoid the child from suffering.He sat down, took the cup on the table and didn\u2019t mind the cold tea at all. He took a sip and ordered the servant waiting outside, \u201cGo make a bowl of calming soup.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan was about to open her mouth to say something when Zhao Nanyu smiled and said to her, \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep well night. It\u2019s good for your health to drink a bowl of calming soup.\u201d He put down the tea cup, and then said softly, \u201cYour body is always weak so drink the medicine for your health before sleeping.\u201dNow she couldn\u2019t even refuse.Song Luan was actually very depressed. Although she almost finished the book, \u201cThe Powerful Minister\u201d, there are a few descriptions about the the cannon fodder\u2014original owner. The author never wrote about how she got along with the male lead, or what kind of life she had lead in the Zhao\u2019s residence.It was just a rough summary of the evil things she did and the result after.After a while, the servant girls brought up the medicine soup. The medicine in the bowl was black and still had a strange smell. Song Luan immediately frowned.This smells bad. She doesn\u2019t want to drink. She doesn\u2019t want to drink it at all.Seeing her thoughts, Zhao Nanyu took the medicine bowl himself, held the spoon handle, and delivered it to her mouth. While she was stunned, he gently wiped the corner of her mouth and smiled.His smile was almost fascinating.Under the swaying of the candle light, the beautiful smile was too frightening.Song Luan opened her mouth and swallowed a spoonful of the bitter medicine. Almost at the same time, a sentence from the book jumped to her head.\u3010Zhao Nanyu clasped her chin and forced her to opened her mouth. He mercilessly pours in the black medicine. His lips sneered, and his hoarse voice was like the fierce ghost and like an evil spirit who climbed out of hell, \u201cGo and die.\u201d\u3011This is the only sentence in \u201cThe Powerful Minister\u201d that mentioned poison. In this way, even if she has read the book, she has no idea why Zhao Nanyu started poisoning, nor where he poisoned or what he used for poison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she was afraid of this, she still obediently drank the medicine that he fed.Song Luan shuddered. The more she thought about it, the colder she became. However, the medicine was boiled by the servant girl in her room. It should not be poisonous.Thinking about it, she gradually stopped shaking.Song Luan\u2019s eyes widened, and her watery eyes looked at him pitifully. Her desire to survive was greater than that of others, \u201cI\u2019m very obedient.\u201dSo, Yu Ge, just spare me a little\u2026Zhao Nanyu was stunned for a moment. Looking at the empty bowl, he lightly smiled, \u201cWell, it is indeed obedient.\u201dThe medicine was bitter, and she swallowed it all. She didn\u2019t lose her temper. She didn\u2019t sound like her usual self.Song Luan\u2019s mouth was full of bitterness, but now she didn\u2019t dare ask for a candied fruit, for fear that Zhao Nanyu would think that she was planning many things, and would then think of the mischievous things she had done before, and would hate her even more.In fact, she actually thought very clearly that she doesn\u2019t intend to be his wife, nor did she expect Zhao Nanyu to fall in love with her.Moreover, it\u2019s not good to have a man who\u2019s possessive.Song Luan only begged Zhao Nanyu to see her as obedient, sensible, and not evil, so she could keep her life. She doesn\u2019t want the experience of being burned to death, Okay?!!She decided to start a low-key life and do good job. Now that the original owner has not yet betrayed him, nor has she neglected her son when he had high fever just to meet her lover. All solutions are still available.It mentioned in the book that the son has a lame leg. When he tried to prevent the mother from meeting with her lover, the child was pushed away by the original owner. He rolled down the stairs while he had a high fever, and broke his leg.At that time, the male lead must have wanted to tear the original owner into pieces.Fortunately, none of this happened before she came. Otherwise, she can just find a rope to hang herself.Zhao Nanyu saw her finish the medicine with his own eyes, and then stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the room to see our eldest son.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t dare to stop him, and even wished that he would go away quickly. After he disappeared, the stone in her heart fell down steadily.He saw that his son is sleeping very well. The little bun was surprisingly well-behaved, did not move or kick the quilt. Zhao Nanyu carefully examined his body and found no scars. The cold in his eyes gradually subsided.He quietly went out of the room and found that Song Luan was still sitting beside the bed, with a thin clothe that covered her lightly, revealing her collarbone and a small part of porcelain white skin.Zhao Nanyu looked at it silently for a while, then retracted his eyes and said to the servants, \u201cGo fetch some water. I want to bathe.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan was already sleepy, but she dared not sleep first in front of Zhao Nanyu. She was somewhat surprised that he would stay.When Zhao Nanyu bathed behind the screen, Song Luan sat beside the bed, dazed, listening to the sound of the water inside. She was on pins and needles, and wished she could get out of her way. She was afraid that something would happen tonight.The more she thought about it, the more she was afraid.Instead, she recalled the major events that had happened to Zhao Nanyu this year.This year, his life was not very good. The emperor blatantly disliked him to make it difficult for him to walk in the court. And people in the Zhao family were quite disrespectful of him and often sneered at him.The Song family didn\u2019t like their son-in-law who didn\u2019t make any achievements. When the original owner returned to her mother\u2019s house during the Dragon Boat Festival, her mother began to urge her to steal Zhao Nanyu\u2019s money and treasures.On the Mid-Autumn Festival, Zhao Nanyu was sent to Huangzhou for a month. A group of people in black rushed and tried to kill him on the way. As a male lead, he certainly would not die, even if he was stabbed twice. He was then rescued.The one who saved him was the legendary female lead. Song Luan doesn\u2019t intend to take the credit of the female lead. When the time comes, she will remind Zhao Nanyu to be careful on the road! This would be a good thing.As she was thinking, the man behind the screen came out in his sleeping clothes, his dark hair was slightly wet. This scene was bright as the moon. Song Luan looked at his face, her throat tightened, and she swallowed.His appearance was indeed very tempting. The bright moonlight outside the window sprinkled on his shoulder. He asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sleep yet?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s observation is excellent and meticulous. Since he stepped into the room, he immediately realized her mistake. In the past, Song Luan never waited for him to sleep together.Song Luan immediately took off her shoes and climbed up the bed. She shrank in the quilt, only revealing her head and trying to keep calm. \u201cI\u2019m asleep\u201dZhao Nanyu suddenly chuckled and looked at the two white tender feet stretching out from the quilt. He stepped forward and held her ankle with his cold fingers. Song Luan felt cold sweat on her back. Even though Zhao Nanyu was very gentle on the surface at the moment, she still felt the cold feeling come out of him.Zhao Nanyu grabbed her ankle and gently stuffed her foot inside the quilt, laughing, \u201cIsn\u2019t it cold?\u201dSong Luan avoided his eyes and whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201dZhao Nanyu turned off the light, and the bedroom was plunged into darkness. The faint white moonlight came in through the window. He lay down beside her.Song Luan gripped the quilt nervously, and her whole body was tensed.Zhao Nanyu seemed to smile faintly. His long and delicate knuckles suddenly touched her cheek. His hands touched her belly, and she felt cold.His voice was hoarse, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He raised his hand and silently removed the hand that was on his chest.A light of disgust flashed in his eyes.He slowly sat up, leaning against the pear-carved wood bed. He was wearing thin clothes. His collar was slightly open, showing his white chest. He propped his head and casually looked at the sleeping woman beside him.The woman on the bed slept badly. She was lying on her back, almost occupying most of the bed. Her hands and feet were still restless, and her legs were rubbing against him all the time.Song Luan\u2019s clothes were messy at the moment, and her long dark hair covered half of her small face. Her eyelashes were thick, and her skin was delicate. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sight gradually went down. He looked at her exposed waist with interest, her quilt was long ago kicked into the corner. Her thin waist gave people unlimited imagination.Zhao Nanyu watched for a long time, and then the light in his eyes sank. The sky outside the window gradually grew bright, turning from dark to light.Song Luan had a nightmare. In the dream she ran barefoot in the forest. Behind her, a wolf was chasing her. She was out of breath. As she was panting, she fell down, but before she got up, the wolf had already come to her, staring at her with fierce eyes. And finally, she opened her mouth wide and bit her lip with her teeth.Then, Song Luan woke up in pain. She didn\u2019t know if it was psychological but she felt that there was a light pain somewhere in her body.As soon as she opened her eyes, she had faced Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes. His eyes were as clear as last night\u2019s, and she could not see the slightest emotion.The morning sun fell on his side face through the window pane. He looked gentle, and elegant. Zhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows slightly, \u201cAwake?\u201dSong Luan silently pulled the quilt to cover her exposed skin, with a heavy sound, \u201cUh..\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t have to get up early for bathing today. He got out of bed and didn\u2019t call the servant girls to come in. Instead, he took off his clothes in front of her and slowly changed into a white-crescent clothe. Then he said to her, \u201cToday, let\u2019s visit grandmother\u2019s place to say our greetings\u201dSong Luan nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dZhaon Nayu\u2019s eyes light up, and the corners of his mouth crossed with a meaninful smile. In the past, Song Luan would not talk kindly, so he just dealed with it.The original owner and the grandmother don\u2019t get along. 9 out of the 10 times they went, she was angry at the grandmother the whole time. Of course, her life won\u2019t get easy after behaving like that.Therefore, on the first day of the year, Song Luan would always throw a fit and would make vicious remarks. She would not go to the main house with him until he had been scolded enough. It\u2019s interesting. He doesn\u2019t know what happened in the days when he was away.So much so that a woman like Song Loan had changed dramatically.Song Luan couldn\u2019t see what he was thinking. She looked at Zhao Nanyu with tearful eyes and longed for him to understand the meaning in her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to change clothes in front of him.Fortunately, Zhao Nanyu was not interested at seeing her dress. He didn\u2019t say anything. He took a deep look at her and then moved to the other room.Song Luan finally didn\u2019t have to worry. She got out of the quilt and found a set of pomegranate red underskirt. She didn\u2019t hurry or slowed herself on changing.While changing, she realized that it was not an illusion that she felt some pain in her body before.There were several obvious pinch marks on her waist. The porcelain and delicate skin could easily be left with marks. It was very obvious. The blue and purple pigment looked painful.She wondered in her heart that she didn\u2019t even know how she got this injury? When did it happen?When she bathe last night, the skin was still fine. How could she wake up with more pinches? Song Luan didn\u2019t think about it. She thought it might be that the wolf in the nightmare was too scary. In the dream, she must have pinched herself severely.After she finished dressing, Zhao Nanyu walked out of the room holding their son\u2019s hand. The father and son looked alike. They have the same temperament, releasing the same feeling of cold aura.But Zhao Shi got the same eyes from her mother\u2014big crystal clear eyes that can pierce people\u2019s hearts.The servant girls came in and quickly made breakfast. There were light dishes and a porridge.Song Luan is from Sichuan Province. She is not happy if the food is not spicy. She looked at the clear porridge on the table. Her mouth unconsciously grunted. She was a little unhappy.Shi Ge was very obedient. He let go of his father\u2019s hand and sat on the chair. He straightened his back and waited for all the food to be placed on the table. In end, he was too young that even if his thoughts are limited, he still can\u2019t control his eyes.Little bun secretly looked at his mother. Last night was the first time he lived in his mother\u2019s residence. Although he was separated by a thin wall, he could still smell his mother\u2019s fragnance when he slept.During the meal, the atmosphere was very dull. The father and son had a gentle and elegant dining posture, and no unecessary sounds were emitted. They didn\u2019t say a word. Naturally, Song Luan could also not speak.The food on the table didn\u2019t suit her taste very much. Song Luan felt that she was chewing wax. She put down her chopstick after eating a little. Zhao Nanyu took a silent look and didn\u2019t say anything.This hasn\u2019t changed much. In order to maintain her slender figure, she eats very little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everything that happened yesterday was like a dream for him.Zhao Nanyu turned sideways and said softly, \u201cAre you full?\u201dZhao Shi nodded. \u201cFather, I\u2019m full.\u201dZhao Nanyu got up and hugged the little bun in his arms. Shi Ge hugged his father\u2019s neck then softly put his small head on his father\u2019s shoulder.He said to Song Luan lightly, \u201cI will take him back to the front yard first.\u201dSong Luan also understood what he meant by this sentence. He was not assured if the child will stay with her. In fact, no one could question him if he thinks like that. After all, the original owner was very mean to her child.Although she wanted to know her son and wants to treat him well, she was still afraid to ask Zhao Nanyu.\u201cWell\u2026.Okay.\u201dThere was cobblestone path leading to the front yard. Zhao Nanyu hugged the little bun. The child in his arms suddenly tightened and burried his face on his father\u2019s clothes, and said, \u201cMother hugged me yesterday.\u201dZhao Nanyu footsteps stopped for a moment, \u201cIs it?\u201dHe was very indifferent.Zhao Shi has some grievances. He was afraid of hating his mother. Just because she suddenly treated him better yesterday, his heart was shaken. However, he didn\u2019t think that his mother was pretending, or that he had ulterior motives.He went on to say, \u201cUncle said my mother\u2019s mind is not pure, but I..\u201d He stammered, \u201cI\u2026don\u2019t think so. I like her smell.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes finally had some movement. He patted his head gently, \u201cYou are too young.\u201dHe still didn\u2019t believe that a woman like Song Luan would change. In the past four years, she has been intensifying her efforts. She is vicious that she has done countless evil things. Thinking of this, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes went cold.Although Zhao Shi is only four years old, the homework should be done every day. Zhao Nanyu took him to the study. His words was not strict but the firm instruction was there, \u201cWrite carefully and fill ten sheets.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKnowing that his son has been a very good boy, rarely crying or asking him for things, he didn\u2019t have to worry about him. He doesn\u2019t seem to be a four-year-old child. \u201cIf the result is satisfactory, I will take you to the horse farm in two days and let you pick your own pony.\u201d\u201cThank you, father.\u201dZhao Nanyu left the study and did not immediately return to Huai Shui residence, but called the people who were responsible in the courtyard. He stood under the magnolia tree in the courtyard, and the mottled light and shadow sprinkled on his handsome face. The crescent-white clothes made a kind of elegant temperament. From a distance, he looked like a refined gentleman.He put his hand on his back, opened his lips, and asked lightly, \u201cWhat has my wife done in the days when I was away? Did someone came to see her? Or did something strange happened to her?\u201dThe servant girl stood in front of him, daring not to look and whispered back, \u201cMadam hasn\u2019t done anything nor has anyone come to look for her.\u201d She recalled it carefully and went on to say, \u201cJust two days ago, Madam suddenly fell ill. Before she fell into coma, she said that she had chest pain and woke up after a days sleep.\u201dAfter hearing this, Zhao Nanyu was silent for a moment, his eyes were calm\u2026He did not continue to ask, and waved his hand to indicate that she could withdraw.Sick? That\u2019s not surprising.The corner of his lips rose a few arcs, and stepped towards Huai Shui Residence. Song Luan thought he would not come for a while, so she took of her socks and was lying on the soft mattress while reading a book.When Zhao Nanyu entered, he saw a pair of white and tender feet shaking in the air.His eyes dimmed, and he raised his eyebrows. He appeared quietly behind her, \u201cI heard people say that you were sick a few days ago?\u201dSong Luan heard his voice, which scared her that even the seven souls and six souls* were sent into flying.The sudden appearance of Zhao Nanyu frightened her so much.\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fLegend:* \u00a0i think this basically means that all her soul (heaven soul, earth soul, and human soul) were too scared that they were sent flying by the appearance of Zhao Nanyu.

For two days, she continued to take medicine. She hid her thought and her face was not normal, \u201cIt\u2019s Okay.\u201dThe breeze blowing in the gap between the window panes eased the dullness of the room.Zhao Nanyu looked at her quietly and pursed his lips, \u201cIs it? That\u2019s good.\u201dSong Luan gave him a half-smile, and didn\u2019t know what to say.Zhao Nanyu looked at her with a smile. Suddenly, he reached out and quickly took out the book behind her. After turning over two pages , he knew what was said in the book.It\u2019s nothing more than a love story between a poor scholar and a rich lady. He had no interest in this kind of stories. Seeing Song Luan\u2019s eager eyes, he suddenly didn\u2019t want to return it.He put away the book as if nothing happened, and said softly, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my grandmother\u2019s place.\u201dSong Luan was ready to come down from the soft mattress only to remember that she didn\u2019t wear socks.\\n Zhao Nanyu glanced at her, did not say anything, and stood up quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201dAs soon as he left, Song Luan became more comfortable. She stepped barefoot on the blanket and rushed to the closet to find socks and shoes to put on. Before long, she appeared in front of Zhao Nanyu.He looked at her silently for a while. The pomegrenate skirt was very beautiful on her body. The delicate belt outlined her figure. A golden ornament was inserted in her hair bun that also fell between her eyebrows. It can be seen that she was dressed carefully.It has to be said that Song Luan stood out from the crows and was very eye-catching.Zhao Nanyu raised his hand and moved the ornament on her head, explaining in his dazed look, \u201cIt\u2019s crooked.\u201dSong Luan was scared, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t make a sound. He raised his steps and walked forward. He didn\u2019t hold her hand. Song Luan didn\u2019t care. She followed him quietly.Each time Song Luan went to this Old lady Zhao\u2019s place dressed up in extravagant fashion, she was often scolded. Song Luan\u2019s beautiful face that was heavily covered with makeup was not liked by the old lady. She instead liked a woman with good virtue, contrary to the appearance of Song Luan.However, she didn\u2019t know the reason why the original owner was scolded and punished for this stupid reason every time. She just felt that this Old lady Zhao didn\u2019t like her.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t intend to remind her, nor did he intend to tell her something.Zhao family is famous. Although he has no official position in the court now, he still held a certain status. He was the teacher of the former emperor and later taught the new emperor. In addition, several sons in the family were very competitive. The eldest son is on duty in the court. The secon son is in Dali temple, and even the third son, who was the least accomplished, was also an official.The third son was Zhao Nanyu\u2019s father.The whole family did not like Zhao Nanyu very much, including his father. When he was young, Zhao Sanye liked to go out to drink wine in the flower house. At that time when he saw the beauty (Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mother), he lied that he was single to her.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mother didn\u2019t sell herself, he was cheated by Zhao Sanye, and soon they had him.As soon as the child was born, Zhao Sanye wouldn\u2019t recognize the mother and son. It would be impossible for the Zhao family to agree to take a prostitute into the house. He wouldn\u2019t see the child not until he was hammered with a cane by grandfather Zhao.After a few years, the third lady (Zhao Sanye\u2019s official wife) also gave birth to a son, which made Zhao Sanye looked down on Zhao Nanyu.Several magnolia trees were planted in main courtyard. The flowers were about to bloom this season and the buds would be beautiful.Crossing the small stone path in the garden and through a vermillion courtyard door, they arrived at the grandmother\u2019s door. Several servants gave notice that they had come. After a while, someone came out and invited them in.Song Luan was very clever throughout the whole process. She decided not to show off or make trouble for the male lead. Only by keeping a low profile could she keep peace.When she entered the room, the smell of temple incense rushed into her nose. In the middle of the room was grandmother Zhao, she was wearing a purple Beizi with a pair of small sleeves. Her clothes were embroidered with peony patterns.Although the old lady is not young, her eyes were still sharp. She looked at them with a little contempt which made Song Luan uncomfortable.Song Luan was sullen. She didn\u2019t know how Zhao Nanyu endured these for many years?It seemed that it\u2019s not easy to be a male lead. He would have to bear the humiliation and heavy burden, and even stick to it all the time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She said faintly, \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to see me, but even if you don\u2019t want to come again on the first day of each month, you still follow the rules.\u201dZhao Nanyu lowered his eyes. \u201cGrandma misundertood.\u201dWhen the old lady him, she had a headache. She was bias. What kind of fun could she have? Moreover, Zhao Nanyu is far less pleasant than his younger brother.\u201cMisunderstanding? Do you know how long you are late? Half an hour. Your brother\u2019s tea is almost over and yet you haven\u2019t come yet! So uneducated!\u201d She didn\u2019t think it was enough to scold Zhao Nanyu. She caught a glimpse of Song Luan, who was dressed like a flower beside him, and scolded her, \u201cAnd you! I\u2019m also an in-law! Why don\u2019t you just make a fuss? What\u2019s on your face? Why do you dressed like that at home?\u201dSong Luan told herself over and over in heart that she could not get angry, that she should be kind and calm.But she should not apologize and admit her mistake, that\u2019s not something the original owner would do.She was afraid of retribution for the severity of her OOC, so she pretended not to hear anything.As this happened, her disinterest look made the old lady mistakenly thought that she was provoking her.The more the old lady looked, the more angry she was. She got up from her chair and came to her. She almost pointed to her forehead. She said angrily, \u201cYou really don\u2019t pay attention to this grandmother. You dare not speak talk back.\u201d\u201cConcubines shouldn\u2019t be shown to the public\u201d<blockquote>(Since song luan was dressed beautifully\u2013like a flower, like a concubine. The old lady was insulting Song Luan that a concubine shouldn\u2019t show herself\u2026)</blockquote>Song Luan held her breath, and the rage around her chest made her feel uneven. This old lady Zhao was unreasonable and too shrewd.She continued to swallow her breath.\u201cMute?!\u201d The old lady Zhao\u2019s angry face was green, \u201cThe whole family is not allowed in public\u201d<blockquote>(Then the whole family of Song Luan shouldn\u2019t show themselves since she was dressed as a concubine..the Old lady insulted her and included her family in this all because Song Luan was not talking back to her lol it infuriated her)</blockquote>Screw the buddhist teachings! Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. She raised her head and opened her mouth. \u201cGrandma, the family includes yourself.\u201d<blockquote>(Song Luan retorted that the old lady was included in the family because Song Luan was already married to Zhao Nanyu, meaning old lady was her in-law hahaha)</blockquote>The old lady\u2019s face changed from green to white.The two million word count of the book \u201cThe Powerful Minister\u201d does not require logic. Everyone is made built for the male lead. The old lady\u2019s malice against her grandson can raise his blackening value well.Suddenly, Song Luan\u2019s wrist tightened. Zhao Nanyu grabbed her and pulled her behind him, then he lowered his eyes, as if he was letting the old lady scold him, \u2019Grandma, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s all grandson\u2019s fault.\u201dWhen the old lady saw him being submissive, the look on her face slightly slowed down, \u201cForget it.\u201dShe was not in a good mood whenever she sees this grandson. He was gloomy whenever she saw him. It was not that he just looked gloomy, but that there was a sharp edge in his eyes, which made her uncomfortable whenever she saw him.Like a wolf, his eyes were full of evil light. One of the reasons why the old lady didn\u2019t like him was that she always felt that the Zhao family would be played under his hands..\u201cGo back.\u201d Her face was normal, but her tone was little impatient. She didn\u2019t want these two people to upset her.She\u2019s just gonna leave it as it is.Old lady Zhao never left any snacks for Zhao Nanyu to eat in the main courtyard. She rarely urged him to take care during the holidays. She hardly cared about this grandson. Although he was beautiful, he looked too much like his prostitute mother. At that time, the Zhao family suffered a lot of ridicule because of his mother. She was scolded by the old man Zhao. It was because she didn\u2019t teach her son well that she provoked such humiliation.The old lady had always hated Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mother, and now she passed all her grievances to him.Zhao Nanyu lowered his eyes, stood near the door frame, his lean body seemed to be a little lonely in the sun. He opened his lips and whispered, \u201cGrandson is leaving.\u201dAfter bidding farewell, Song Luan went out with him. She felt from the bottom of her heart that Zhao Nanyu would be in a bad mood at the moment. She was sensible so she did not disturb him.He was sure to be suspicious if she talked too much and would make too many mistakes.The two people walked together in silence.Zhao Nanyu glanced over her lightly, and saw the blank look on her face. The corners of his lips slightly raised, he smiled coldy. As expected, she didn\u2019t care about him at all. She even made trivial gestures.It didn\u2019t take long for him to retract his glance. He walked forward, regardless of whether the person behind him could catch up.Song Luan had to improve her speed and followed him closely like a small tail. Zhao Nanyu suddenly stopped, and inevitably hit his back. The man\u2019s back was as hard as stone, so her nose became a bit red.She touched her nose. She unconsciously softly said, \u201cIt hurts..\u201dThe voice of Song Luan fell on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart with a strange sweetness.The girl\u2019s complaint had a natural coquettish tone.Zhao Nanyu turned around and stared at her red nose with calm eyes. He held out his fingers, grabbed her chin and raised it up.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d It\u2019s just three words but it felt like he\u2019s collecting debts.Song Luan avoided his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the chin, it\u2019s the nose. It hurts. I\u2019m not lying to you.\u201dHer glistening, tearful eyes, made her look like she was bullied. She looked weak and fragile, it\u2019s as if he could break her with just one hand.Surprisingly, Zhao Nanyu actually liked looking at her pitiful look full of grievances.Zhao Nanyu unconsciously strengthened his hand.Song Luan mentally took a breath of cool air and frowned. Her eyes were slightly red but she did not dare cry for pain. She was holding back from his provoking actions.Damn it! It hurts!Zhao Nanyu naturally saw her unwilling expression on her face. He suddenly felt that bullying her seemed very enjoyable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s no wonder she was about to cry out of pain. She was afraid that Zhao Nanyu used so much strength. Her body was like tender tofu, she could pinch out marks and it would be hard to get ride of them.Before going to sleep, Song Luan called the servant girl who was at the door to come into the room, and asked, \u201cDid master say when he\u2019ll come?\u201dAlthough the servant girl didn\u2019t face her in panic for the first time, she was still cautious and respectful for fear that she would be beaten if she said something wrong, \u201cMaster wouldn\u2019t come over without notice.\u201dThe servant didn\u2019t know what happened with Madam. Master almost never come at night. There were only two times in every month. And in these two times, the lady was always impatient and disgusted. Why did she suddenly ask tonight?Song Luan didn\u2019t know that their husband and wife relationship was so cold. Unless she made trouble again or that she would beat Zhao Shi to educate him, would he come and set food in her yard.She sighed, \u201cI see. You can go out.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d After a pause, the servant girl buried her head and said in a low voice, \u201cI will bring you the calming soup.\u201dSong Luan really didn\u2019t want to drink the bitter medicine soup. She opened her mouth and refused. The servant girl seemed to be in panic, \u201cBut if you don\u2019t drink it, you can\u2019t sleep well at night.\u201dShe changed her mind and said, \u201cThen you can bring it.\u201dThe bowl of medicine didn\u2019t fall into Song Luan\u2019s stomach. She did not forget the poisoning! Since it\u2019s not written in the book of \u201cThe Powerful Minister\u201d, she can only find it by herself.After the servant girl went out, she poured the medicine soup into the bonsai plant beside the window. If it\u2019s really poisonous, the bonsai plant would surely die.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t come at night. If he didn\u2019t come, it would be good. Song Luan would rather he didn\u2019t come. Her chin still hurt.When she woke up the next, the sky was already bright. The jade hall was full of light fragrance.After Song Luan combed and washed, someone brought in breakfast. It was the usual light porridge. She ate two small bowls of porridge with pickles. She was in a good mood after filling her stomach.For several days, Song Luan lived such a peaceful life in Huai Shui. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t come or even sent someone to deliver the words. Naturally, she didn\u2019t take the initiative to approach him. The only pity was that her son was was also guarded tightly in the front yard, and she had no chance to meet to him.A few days later, Song Luan found that the bonsai plant that she threw the medicine soup with was still alive and well. She was relieved for the most part. It seemed that the medicine soup was okay.On the day of spring break, Zhao Nanyu finally appeared before her, holding the four-year old son. The lovely bun was held by him. The expression of the father and son were the same.Song Luan wore a crimson skirt today, her collar was white. The waist was slender, and the eyes were bright and shining.Shi Ge called out, \u201cMother\u201dShe liked this cute and soft child very much from the bottom of her heart. She could not help and touched his head, but soon took back her hand.She could even detect the cold eyes of Zhao Nanyu on her. She felt a bit chilly. Song Luan didn\u2019t dare look at him. She was afraid of the look in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes. They were gentle on the surface, but in fact, they were cold and sharp.During lunch, she could only hear the sound of moving chopsticks. Song Luan wanted to cry. She didn\u2019t dare stretch her chopsticks to him to get more vegetables. This meal time felt like being torture.Zhao Nanyu halted moving his chopsticks first, and stared at her in a relaxed manner, \u201cDoes your chin still hurt?\u201dNow I\u2019m asking what you\u2019ve been doing all this time!!! At that time, it hurt! How many days have passed!!! Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too late?!She roared wildly in her heart, but she did not dare say it. Song Luan shook her head, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201dHe nodded, and then he said nothing.Shi Ge suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m finished eating.\u201dSong Luan sighed once when saw this little bun. The child was so lovely. Maybe it was because of their blood relationship, the more she saw this son, the more she liked him. She wanted to rub his head and play with him.\u201cCan you go back to the front yard by yourself?\u201d Zhao Nanyu asked. He was unwilling for Song Luan and his son to stay together.Zhao Shi lowered his head and unexpectedly replied, \u201cFather, I wanted to stay here a little longer.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s smile dropped for a minute. He looked at Song Luan with calculated look.She felt an ominous feeling from Zhao Nanyu\u2019s smile. Honestly, she didn\u2019t expect this son to like her quickly. Just once she treated him well, the child now wanted to stay with her.(\uffe3 ^ \uffe3) \u309e I can endure this!\u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Nanyu himself didn\u2019t stay much, and went to the study in the front yard.Zhao Shi sat very upright, hands on his legs, his small back was straight. His white delicate cheeks were slightly bulging, and he had on a serious look. Song Luan wanted to go up to tease him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His body seemed to be stiff for a moment, and his fingers tightened. He didn\u2019t know why he wanted to stay, but maybe because he hadn\u2019t seen his mother for half a month.In fact, Zhao Shi knew that he missed the feeling of being held last time in his mother\u2019s arms. When he closed his eyes, he could still smell his mother\u2019s fragrance. She would care about him and ask him of his calligraphy, or if he was tired or not?\u201cDo you want to eat?\u201d Song Luan wanted to beat herself after asking. He had just finished lunch. He must no be hungry.Sure enough, the little bun shook his head. \u201cNot hungry.\u201dSong Luan seemed to be at a loss. It was also her first time to be a mother! Because she was in a hurry to think of topics, she blurted, \u201cCan you play chess?\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, he nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dShe\u2019s ashamed to say that, as a modern person, she only knows the rules of chest, but can\u2019t play it. In short, she can understand it but can\u2019t play it. She smiles, \u201cWe won\u2019t play chess today. I\u2019ll teach you a new way to play it.\u201dShi Ge has never heard that there are other ways to play chess. The big bright grape-like eyes looked at her for a moment. They were obedient, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan found a set of good chess piece from the cabinet. She sat cross-legged and her son was sitting on small cushion. There was only a low table between them. She explained the rules of Gomoku\u00a0to her son.The child is also very smart. He can understand just by listening.The light in the afternoon was more gentle in other days. The lazy golden light shines in the room through the window pane. It was warm and bright.The mother and son were stitting quietly. Song Luan held the white piece in her hand, and the brother held the black piece.Song Luan concentrated on playing chess and was not affected by the outside world at all. She held the white piece while supporting her chin with the other hand. She stared at the chess game for a long time before slowly placing it on the board. It was a very cautious move. After all, she didn\u2019t want to lose to a child.In fact, the son had deliberately let his mother won several times. It seems that she didn\u2019t see that he always placed the piece in the wrong place so his mother would win.Unconsciously, an hour has already passed.Song Luan yawned and said, \u201cAre you sleepy? Do you want to take a break?\u201dShi Ge put down his chess piece wisely though he was reluctant to give up, \u201cI\u2019m a bit sleepy, so I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dHe returned to his stiff tone.Song Luan reached out her hand and pinched the small face that she long-coveted. She smiled and said, \u201cSleep here. I also want to have a break anyways, so let\u2019s do it together.\u201dHe was stunned for a long time. The place she pinched was red and hot. The temperature on his face also rose. He thought his mother was impatient with him and wanted to drive him away.His voice was small, it seemed like he was embarassed, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan let his little hand into the room. The four-year-old child seemed to be able to do everything by himself. After taking off his shoes, he took off his outer garment, and put himself in a good position. He didn\u2019t dare move around. He was lying in the innermost place.She got into the bed and covered the little bun, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201dAfter a while, Song Luan leaned on him and let him sleep in her arms.The little bun in her arms didn\u2019t move. He didn\u2019t dare to sleep, so his eyes were open. He\u2019s afraid that once he wakes up, the bed will be empty.After a while, the little bun didn\u2019t stay awake for too long, and fell asleep in her arms. The sky outside the window gradually darkened, and the light turned a little dark.When the sun had set, the door creaked and was pushed open from outside. Zhao Nanyu stepped inside with his black boots. He was wearing dark clothes, and his whole body was filled with killing aura. The boots fell on the blanket quietly.He walked into the inner room, stood in front of the bed and looked at the two people sleeping on the bed. Those eyes, which were usually gentle like water faded off its disguise, and in turn exposed deep anger and a terrible desire for control.The woman in the bed, with her collar slightly open, exposed white and delicate collarbones in front of his eyes.Zhao Nanyu lowered his eyes to cover the dark light in them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She put on her shoes and walked out. Zhao Nanyu sat by the window with a cup of tea in his hand. His back was facing her, and when he heard her footsteps, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s throat was dry, and she said in a hoarse voice, \u201cWell.\u201dZhao Nanyu put down the teacup in his hand, turned around to look at her and explained, \u201cThe child is with his grandmother\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d She whispered back. Every time she was alone with him, she was uncomfortable. She was still afraid of him.Zhao Nanyu stood up, walked over, and stood in front of her. His tall body covered the sun light. He was much taller than her. He lowered his eyes and looked at her carefully. He pursed his lips and said, \u201cIt\u2019s very cold, you should wear more clothes.\u201dSince she just woke up, she was only wearing a set of thin bedclothes. Her face was plain and her face was muddleheaded. It seemed that she was not yet fully awake.Song Luan was still in a trance. When she woke up, she felt sleepy and lost her ability to think. She went back to the inner room and put on some more clothes before she came out. Her black hair was still messy, so she just put on a hair pin and didn\u2019t care much about it.She thought Zhao Nanyu wouldn\u2019t come here tonight. After all, he had never stepped into her house twice a day. So what attracted him to come here!? She can\u2019t figure it out!Zhao Nanyu looked at her thoughtfully and smiled, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Song Luan quickly returned to her senses and responded very quickly.The edge in his eyes was dark, and he stroked the finger on his thumb unconsciously. He suddenly smiled and said, \u201cBy the way, I almost forgot to tell you that the kid likes you very much. I didn\u2019t bring him here for how many days and yet he kept thinking about you. He implicitly told me that he wanted to see you. Sure enough, there\u2019s a connection between mother and son.\u201dJust giving her son a little sweetness, even when she used to be bad with him, the child still turned to like her.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s words were mostly to test her, or maybe to trap her.Song Luan clenched her hand, and her palms were already sweating. When he looked at her so attentively, she couldn\u2019t help but be nervous. Her scalp became numb and she raised her face and gave a cute and pleasant smile, \u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t find the kid as cute as now. It\u2019s unusual. I couldn\u2019t help but be very nice to him.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zhao Nanyu looked uncertain, and could not believe her words.In fact, he was suspicious of her and didn\u2019t believe half of what she said. Of course, it would be good if that was the truth.Song Luan\u2019s face was a little hot, hanging her head, and softly said, \u201cHmm\u201d. It sounded like a mosquito.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t ask any further, as if he had just let her go. He said slowly, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\u201cA little bit.\u201dIn fact, Song Luan was reluctant to eat at the same table as him. Every meal time, she only dared to stare at the dish in front of her eyes, and did not eat more. She was stiff and could not move her back, for fear that he might find something wrong.Zhao Nanyu nodded and then asked the servant girl to set up the meal.Tonight\u2019s dishes are especially luxurious. There was a jar of sake on the table. The wine jar was fragnant. Song Luan looked at it several times and licked her lips. The gluttony in her heart is about to break out.She liked fruit wine very much. The ancient wine smell more fragrant than the modern times. She was really greedy. But Song Luan\u2019s tolerance to liquior was not very good, so it\u2019s not good if she drank too much.She sat on the edge of Zhao Nanyu, and did not touch the glass he was holding. She bowed her head and ate silently.Zhao Nanyu, who was meticulous and perceptive, had a first-class ability of observing people. It was easy to see what she thinking just from her face. With a raised eyebrow, he asked, \u201cWould you like to have a drink together?\u201dSong Luan did not resist the temptation. She nodded her head, but her heart was cautious. On the surface, she had to pretend to be strong and she spat the word coldly, \u201cWell.\u201dZhao Nanyu poured half a glass of wine for her and gave it to her, \u201cDrink it.\u201dHe looked at her with great interest and wanted to see some hints from her face. Zhao Nanyu was not unaware that when he went out for a trip, Song Luan changed a lot. He wanted to know whether she was pretending or not.Song Luan felt relieved and boldly sipped the wine. It tasted sweet. It was much better than what she thought. She drank half of the wine unconsciously after taking a sip.The candlelight was dim and shone on her delicate face. The white face that was originally fair and radiant slowly rose to a touch of red, adding to her beautiful appearance.Zhao Nanyu silently filled her glass with wine. Song Luan didn\u2019t realize it as he poured another glass. After taking a sip, she whispered something that the fruit wine was delicious.She didn\u2019t feel anything at first after a few glasses, but later, she found that her head became heavier and her face was hot. In front of her, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s figure seemed to double. She tried to widen her eyes and looked at it carefully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stood up and held her hands on the table but she could barely stand. Her upper body was shaking as if she would fall down at any time.She hiccuped. She had too much of alcohol.Song Luan did not move. She stared at him with wide eyes. Her eyes were slightly red and her brows were frowning. She was thinking.Zhao Nanyu was stared at by her like this, but he didn\u2019t get angry. He chuckled, \u201cDrunk?\u201dSong Luan shook her head unconsciously. She looked a little silly, \u201cNo.\u201dOther than being dizzy, she didn\u2019t feel any discomfort, and her brain was clear.She looked up at him with ripples in her eyes. Song Luan still remembered that he was the male lead and would become powerful in the future, so she praised him sincerely \u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201dZhao Nanyu was stunned. Suddenly, she threw herself at him and put her hands around his neck. Her delicate body was close to him. Her lips were slightly opened. She said again, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201dThe faces of two people were close to each other. Zhao Nanyu lowered his eyes. Her face was puffed, her skin delicate and smooth. He stretched out his hand and rubbed his fingertips on her cheeks. It felt good.Song Luan\u2019s courage grew when she was drunk. She was as soft as a bone. She was not afraid of him at all. She hugged and touched him. Her beautiful eyes were like the crescent moon.Zhao Nanyu was dumbfounded for a moment, but he immediately recovered. The head sticking in his arms fell on him, as if she had fallen asleep.He always felt that Song Luan had changed. After a moment of silence, Zhao Nanyu, for the first time, picked up the woman and carried into the inner room. She was very comfortable. She was laid on the bed and was covered with the quilt. She kicked away the quilt with both feet. She was discontent and muttered, as if she was losing her temper, \u201cI am so hot that I don\u2019t want the quilt.\u201dZhao Nanyu was about to leave. After seeing this, he frowned and paused for a moment. He turned around and went back. Silently, he covered the quilt for her again.Song Luan pushed off the quilt again. She felt that it was not enough so she tried to take off her clothes with her hands. However, the ancient clothes were too complicated. She could not solve it for a while and she hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m so hot, I\u2019m so hot..It\u2019s annoying.\u201dZhao Nanyu stood quietly and looked at her for a long time. He sat beside the bed, untied her dress belt, took off her garments, and her skin was exposed. It became more white in the moonlight.Zhao Nanyu did not squint, and there were no slightest waves in his dark eyes, as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything. His expression was cold, Song Luan seemed to be dreaming. She was sleeping soundly and her mouth moved as if she was talking in her dreams.Her voice was too light. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t hear it clearly at first. He leaned down and listened carefully before he finally heard what she said in her dream.\u201cDon\u2019t kill me.\u201dThese four words fell in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s ear, and he was surprised for a moment. The woman in front of him was pitiful. She tightened the quilt with her small hand. The expression on her delicate face was pitiful. She looked so weak that he could cut her neck with his hand.Zhao Nanyu gently put his palm on her neck and pinched it a little, forcing her to raise her head, Song Luan was hurt by this pinch that she was frightened in her dream. Her eyes gleamed with tears. A few drops of crystal clear tears slipped down. This scene fell in his eyes and only thought that it was extremely beautiful.Zhao Nanyu smiled softly. Feeling as if he was in a good mood, his lips were slightly raised.He suddenly lowered his head, and the cold lips and teeth slowly licked the tears on her face. In a rare moment, he didn\u2019t have that deep dislike for her. The corner of his lips gradually fell down. His eyes were red, and he took a fierce bite on the corners of her mouth. Only when he tasted the rustiness of blood did he stop. Song Luan in her sleep seemed to know that she was afraid and her fragile body trembled.Zhao Nanyu gently stroke her back and slowly calmed down. He did not stay overnight. Before he stepped out of the Huai Shui, he cut off the wick.Song Luan didn\u2019t sleep very well that night. She had a strange dream the whole time. In the middle of the night, she woke up thirsty. Her throat was dry and her mouth hurt.She was still half awake when she left left the bed and went to the table. She felt it with both hand before she finally touched the tea cup. She raised her head and gulped down the tea.She did not expect that those two cups of liquior were so powerful. She almost gone unconscious! She couldn\u2019t remember clearly what she did and what she said when she was drunk. She couldn\u2019t be unruly.Otherwise, it\u2019s not good to sit here and drink tea.It wasn\u2019t until Song Luan\u2019s mouth became more painful that she discovered the small wound on it. She touched it with her fingertips and she immediately retracted her finger when it stung.Oh, it really hurt.Who did it? Anway, Song Luan didn\u2019t think it was her own doing. She thought about it carefully and the hand holding the water cup was frozen in place. Couldn\u2019t it be that it was the man who bit it?The more she pondered about it, the more she thought that Zhao Nanyu really was a little beast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All kinds of flowers planted in the courtyard bloomed, and the fragrance filled the yard.Zhao Nanyu has been transferred from the Imperial Academy to Dali temple for duty. He deosn\u2019t have much leisure but is also not very busy. The students who took part in the imperial examination together with him were now living in the court. It seems that only he hadn\u2019t been so popular in the past two years.There were many snobbish eyes in the court. Seeing that he was neither favored nor liked by the emperor, they seldom talk to him. Some young noblemen in the family often treated him as a joke.Zhao Nanyu often heard people ridicule him. It looked like he didn\u2019t care.When Zhao Nanyu came home early morning, Shi Ge had just read two pages of the book. When he saw him, the child cried out, \u201cFather.\u201dZhao Nanyu stepped forward and touched his head. \u201cDo you understand?\u201dThe child nodded, \u201cI can understand. Uncle taught me.\u201d\u201cDid your uncle come?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m waiting for you.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s brother was the only one who had a good relationship with him. Zhao Chao was born by an aunt of Zhao Erye. He was also a commoner in the Zhao family, but Zhao Erye treated him well.Zhao Nanyu saw him in the study, and Zhao Chao smiled at him, \u201cSecond Brother\u201dHe said softly, \u201cWell.\u201d After a paused, he asked, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201dThere were major events to be discussed. Today happens to be the first day. Every month on the first day of the month, Zhao family must hold a banquet. Everyone must go to the main yard to feast together. This rule was set by the head of the Zhao. No one dares to disobey it.Of course, Zhao Nanyu, the son whom was hated by his father, was not paid much attention on this on occasion. He even heard several other cousins talking about him from time to time.In the family, everyone except Zhao Chao, despised his birth and regarded him as a disgrace.Zhao Chao said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just happened to come here and teach Shi Ge the lessons. I thought I should wait for you so we can go to dinner together.\u201dHe didn\u2019tt like family banquet either.Zhao Nanyu was silent for a moment, his thin lips pressed in a straight line, and he said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll wait for your second sister-in-law to finish dressing before I go to the main courtyard. You don\u2019t have to worry about me. Go first.\u201dZhao Chao was shocked, and the smile on his face gradually subsided. He said, \u201cSister-in-law?\u201dDoes that woman deserve to be called second sister-in-law? She was cruel to his second brother. He didn\u2019t know how much face his second brother lost. The most annoying was that she went to the bank to borrow money privately in the Zhao\u2019s bank account under the name of his second brother. This action was directly stabbing the head of the Zhao.That time, old man Zhao disciplined Zhao Nanyu.Zhao Nanyu understood what he was surprised about. He didn\u2019t explain, but said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201dOf course, Zhao Chao refused to leave. He had to know for himself since Shi Ge said that she had changed. At that time, he was not concerned about it. How could a woman\u2019s evil scorpion heart suddenly be better? He didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cSecond brother, can\u2019t you see what kind of person she is? You musn\u2019t let her cheat you.\u201dZhao Nanyu gave a slight smile. His eyes looked like it was smiling but it was not sincere. His voice laced with sarcasm, \u201cI know.\u201dZhao Chao calmed down. His second brother was much smarter than him, and his thinking was above him. He knew he wasn\u2019t blinded by that woman.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter Zhao Chao left, Zhao Nanyu stayed in the study quietly for a while, meditated under the fragrance of Ban Zhu, and then went to Huai Shui residence.<blockquote>If you guys can\u2019t google translate the page once you click the meaning of Ban Zhu, I\u2019ll just explain it here: this Ban Zhu is a chinese medicine that is used for clearing\u00a0away heat and detoxifying; dampness and itching; swelling and pain relief.\u00a0Main dysentery; sores; eczema; itchy skin; caterpillar puncture; bruises.</blockquote>Song Luan just learned that she was going to the main court to have dinner tonight. Many of the things about Zhao family in the book of \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019 were just taken in one stroke without detailed writing. This kind of trivial things were not written.She knew the fate of the Zhao family. Zhao relatives and servants who bad mouthed Zhao Nanyu fell into ruins, and Zhao Nanyu\u2019s father was deprived of his rights.These people were not very close to her. They didn\u2019t collude with each other. What made her worried was Zhao Nanyu\u2019s brother, Zhao Wenyan, a 17-year-old, who had an affair with Song Luan!In the book of \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, it was written that Zhao Wenyan fell in love with Song Luan after passing the imperial exam. For his lifetime, he stayed single. He rescued her several times she was in trouble. In the days when the original owner was dying of poison and laid in bed, he was the only one who sought medicine for her.After she died, he was never able to recover, and soon lost his life.Zhao Wenyan was a very good person. He was devoted to the original owner. But now, she was completely afraid to be involved with him.Fortunately, Zhao Wenyan was still studying and would not take part in the imperial examination until next year. Song Loan didn\u2019t how Zhao Wenyan fell in love with the original owner. For tonight, she could only avoid him and not let him fall in love with her. This would be a good thing for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He walked quietly and stood at the door. The golden afterglow sprinkled on his shoulder. He looked at her with quiet eyes.Song Luan was contemplating and seemed to have no awareness of his arrival. She sat in front of the vanity mirror, holding her cheeks in both hands, and her pink mouth grunted unhappily. She seemed to be talking to herself as she pulled her hair. She knocked her head on the vanity table right after. Zhao Nanyu looked at her and realized she was a little cute.Zhao Nanyu finally came out and asked, \u201cReady? It\u2019s time to go.\u201dSong Luan was startled by the sudden voice. Almost immediately, she sobered up and raised her head, her round eyes looked dumbfounded. She didn\u2019t even know when he came.The man stood under the window kilt. He was dressed in green shirt, and he looked gentle and elegant. Half of his body bathed in the sun, shining with holiness. He was sacred and could pass as a high-ranking official.Song Luan replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded to her. \u201cNow that we are ready, let\u2019s go together.\u201dIn the past, they never went to the main courtyard together. The original owner was extremely disgusted with him and only wanted to come after him.Song Luan was dressed very beautiful tonight. She had on bright clothes, lotus-colored tulle skirts, red embroidered shoes, and wore exquisite makeup. It magnified her facial features even more. Her eyes were bright and her smile was sincere.They walked side by side. Song Luan did not dare to lean too close to him, for fear that he would be annoyed. They had nothing to say along the way.They first went to pick up their son. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t ask her to lead the child, but it was the child who walked beside her. The awkward family of three went to the main courtyard together.They arrived on time, but most of the relatives were already there.The old lady Zhao told him to bring their son into her room first. It seemed that she hadn\u2019t seen this great grandson for a long time. She wanted to see and talk to him.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t stop him, just told him to listen.After hearing this, Song Luan glanced at him and found that he was the most obedient child she had ever seen.The decoration of the main courtyard is better than that of the small courtyard where they live. There was a small pond in the middle of the courtyard with liod heads inlaid on the stone pillars.They younger generation of the Zhao family stood by the pond. Their cousins were all about the same age, all of them were gorgeous. They talked and laughed together.No one knew who saw Zhao Nanyu first. He raised the fan in his hand and the words he uttered were not respectful. He called out, \u201cSecond brother, how did you come?\u201dSong Luan looked over where the voice was. The face was just barely handsome. His laugh was a little vicious.It was Zhao Bao, the youngest son of uncle Zhao, whose qualifications were quite ordinary. He failed in the imperial examination the year before. Since he was a child, he didn\u2019t like this talented and bright second brother. He was the eldest son of the extended family. He had a noble status. He doesn\u2019t think Zhao Nanyu, whose mother was a prositutre, was not worthy of being his second brother. For this reason, he didn\u2019t talk about his wrong doings in private. In front of him, he was always sarcastic of Zhao Nanyu.\u201cNot yet.\u201dThe implication was that he was not too late.Zhao Bao\u2019s mouth drooped down, as if he was not very happy. \u201cThat\u2019s the same. It\u2019s impossible for you to meet grandmother.\u201dThe whole family knew that Old lady Zhao didn\u2019t like Zhao Nanyu. Meeting once in a year, of course, there were no good words between them.Song Luan stood beside him like a wooden man, pretending that she could not hear anything that had nothing to do with her. She lowered her eyes and stared at the tip of her shoes.Her mind had drifted away.She\u2019s so hungry. She\u2019s really hungry. She\u2019s starving to death.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s thin lips slightly pursed, without a squeak.Zhao Bao didn\u2019t reap the benefits of his insults. He snorted, glanced at him with so much contempt, and turned to enter the room.Song Luan didn\u2019t know that there was someone at their back. The lean figure was standing five steps away from her. He frowned and looked at her. He was disgusted from the bottom of his eyes. Then he raised his eyes to Zhao Nanyu. His tone was impatient, \u201cSecond brother, why are you coming with her?\u201dAlmost at the same time, Song Luan noticed that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mood on her side suddenly fell to a freezing point, a sign before a storm.Her wrist was held tightly and she was pulled behind him. Zhao Nanyu bit his words and asked in a cold voice, \u201cWhat about father?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart was startled. She raised her eyes in surprise and stared at the young man in front of her. This was Zhao Wenyan who was going to die for the original owner??? Why was he so disrespectful??She cried in a low voice. The man who held her wrist used his strength. It hurt.Song Luan\u2019s eyes turned to Zhao Nanyu and asked him to stop holding her hand with so much strength. She didn\u2019t know what she had done to make him angry. She was really wronged.The man was fierce. Suddenly, he became even fiercer.She\u2019s a little scared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face was still tender, eyes were bright and his expression was impatient. Although he and Zhao Nanyu were not were not born of the same mother, they had similarities in appearance. Standing together, anyone can see that they were brothers.He looked at Song Luan with disdain, as if he was looking at something dirty. He was afraid of getting too close to a disgusting thing, \u201cFather will come later.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded. \u201cI see.\u201dZhao Wenyan was more and more angry. He didn\u2019t like his second brother very much, but he didn\u2019t want to see him being gossiped around in the family. After the second sister-in-law who didn\u2019t know how to behave entered their family, the gossiping became even more intense!Song Luan was a beautiful woman, but her mind was too poisonous. She had a lot of mistakes and made second brother lose his face.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time. Come in.\u201dA large number of people came except for the eldest son of uncle Zhao, who was sent to Beijing and still hadn\u2019t returned. Everyone sat on the chair in their order.Old man Zhao sat in the middle. He was over sixty-years-old, and still in good spirits. He stroked his white beard, glanced at all the people on the table, and said, \u201cEat.\u201dAlthough it\u2019s a family dinner, Song Luan still felt that the atmosphere was very stiff. She held her chopsticks and didn\u2019t dare to move around. She was very smart and sensible. She would like it if no one noticed her, but she still felt that there were several pairs of eyes watching her move, as if she was the main character of this family dinner.Her eyes were only glued on the food while chewing the meal that taste like wax. It was almost an hour and most of the people had already put down their chopsticks one by one.Old man Zhao valued every grandson very much. Those who didn\u2019t have reputation would ask lessons one by one. Those who had reputation would ask about things in the court. In short, they were very attentive.After the meal, Old man Zhao took a step away from the grandsons, and told them they were not allowed to follow him. Old man Zhao looked at Zhao Nanyu deeply, and said, \u201cYu Er, stay with me for a game of chess and then you can go.\u201dZhao Nanyu said, \u201cYes.\u201dThe Old man took out his best white jade chessboard. When the two people played chess, the others stood by and watched.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s chess skill was not inferior than his grandfather\u2019s, and he didn\u2019t plan to let Old man Zhao win the chess. Every step was critical. After a long time of playing, the old man gradually fell behind.This made other relatives look both jealous and funny. They were jealous because he had the ability to compete with his grandfather in chess. The funny thing was that he would not let his grandfather rile him in chess.\u201cYu Er\u2019s chess skill is quite advanced.\u201d\u201cGrandfather\u2019s praise is too much.\u201dThe Old man pud down his chess pieces. He didn\u2019t seem to be angry about losing, but he was very happy. This was the reason why he only let Zhao Nanyu play chess with him every time. He won\u2019t let him win just so he can play happily.After playing chess, the old man let them go with a wave of his hand.Just after leaving the main court, Zhao Sanye said to Zhao Nanyu behind him with a cold face, \u201cCome with me. I have something to say to you.\u201dZhao Nanyu lowered his head, so no one could see the expression on his face.Song Luan was standing not far from them with her sleeping son. Zhao Sanye\u2019s face was dark and ugly. His face was full of unhappiness.Zhao Sanye was in a bad mood at the moment. He had a lot of complains about his son, even some disgust. He was even more disgusted with his mother who was born in a lower class family. He didn\u2019t make any achievements in the court, so he couldn\u2019t be pleased by the old man. However, the son he didn\u2019t look forward to was more popular with the old man than him, which made him feel uneasy.\u201cYour mother\u2019s relative is also on duty in Dali temple, right?\u201d Asked Zhao Sanye.The \u2018mother\u2019 in his mouth was not Zhao Nanyu\u2019s biological mother, but Zhao Sanye\u2019s current wife.\u201cYes.\u201dThere was a flash of fierceness in Zhao Sanye\u2019s eyes, pointing to him with angry voice, saying, \u201cYour mother told you to take care of her relatives more. Why did you turn a deaf ear? Not only did you not take care of him, you also did not help him when he\u2019s in trouble.\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled. Not only did he not help, but even the man was dismissed.\u201cMy father looks up to me too much.\u201d The light sarcasm in his tone was like a slap to Zhao Sanye\u2019s face.Zhao Sanye was beaten back by him. He couldn\u2019t exhale in one breath. He was chocked in his chest. He pointed to him and opened his mouth. \u201cHow could an evil son come from me?\u201dZhao Sanye\u2019s face was red with anger. He was too angry.It was not the first time that Zhao Nanyu has been scolded by him. When he listens to a word like \u2018evil son\u2019, his heart would still be calm.He bowed his hand and there was no fault in his respect, \u201cIf father had nothing else to say, I will go back first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Luan was not far form them.\u00a0It was difficult for her not to hear anything.To be reasonable, Song Luan was very reluctant to see Zhao Nanyu being scolded by his father. Zhao Nanyu must not want her to see such a shameful scene.In other words, she actually felt that Zhao Nanyu was a little pitiful. Now he had no power. He was looked down upon by other and despised by her own father. But thinking of her death in the future, she felt more pitiful than him.She was sighing when Zhao Nanyu had come to her. The moonlight lengthened his figure, and a pair of black eyes looked at her coldly. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter holding her son for a period of time, Song Luan\u2019s hands were aching. Her son was a little heavy. She blinked and summoned up her courage to sell her cuteness towards the man, \u201cMy hands are sour.\u201dHer son hugged her neck without any care, buried his face in her neck, and was sleeping quietly.Zhao Nanyu silently took the little bun from her arms, and went straight to the backyard.Song Luan followed him, and when he was about to enter the room, she carefully opened her mouth and asked, \u201cWhere are you sleeping tonight?\u201dZhao Nanyu seldom sleeps on her side in the past few days. He only slept twice and never touched her. Song Luan thought that he really hated her.So she naively thought that Zhao Nanyu was just visiting the house and then would leave after.Zhao Nanyu lifted his eyelids and asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu saw enough of the wonderful colors on her face, and he mercifully gave his reply, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep here.\u201dSong Luan hung her head, \u201cOh.\u201dShe hasn\u2019t forgotten the last time she was drunk and was bitten by Zhao Nanyu in the corner of her mouth. And everytime she was alone with him, Song Luan was naturally afraid. His eyes were deep as if he wanted to eat people.Zhao Nanyu laid his son on the bed of the side room, covered the quilt and walked out. The servants just prepared the hot water. Song Luan sat at the table in a hurry. When she saw him, she tood up. \u201cGo to the bath first. I\u2019ll first take off the makeup on my face.\u201dHe nodded and began to undress in front of her. After leaving a covering, he walked to the screen. Song Luan\u2019s face was not hot, but the sound of the water made the temperature on her rise.After a while, the sound of the water stopped.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s voice came to her through a screen. \u201cBring clean clothes for me.\u201dSong Luan had only two sets of his clothes in this room. She soon found them from the closet. Her hands began to sweat. She closed her eyes tightly and did not dare take a look at him.Zhao Nanyu was lying in the tub with his upper body naked. His delicate face was hidden in the misty water. He suddenly pulled her close to him into the water.Song Luan called out in a low voice. She was terrified. She fell into the water, her thin clothes were almost imeddiately wet by the warm water.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s burning eyes fell on her slightly wet neckline. He stood up, wiped the water off his body and put on his clothes. Then he looked at her still lying in the bucket, with a smile on his eyes, \u201cYou should wash too.\u201dHe found that every time he saw Song Luan\u2019s sad and weak appearance, his heart seemed to be more joyful.Song Luan reluctantly washed herself with the water he used, and then climbed to bed in a strict manner. She slept inside the quilt, her limbs were tight, and she didn\u2019t dare to occupy more space and even breathe heavily.Zhao Nanyu, as usual, put out the light and covered himself with the quilt without doing anything. Even his hands did not touch her, so Song Luan\u2019s sitff body gradually relaxed.In the dark, Zhao Nanyu moved for a moment, and his palm suddenly fell on her waist, pinching the flesh on her skin intentionally. Song Luan closed her eyes and pretended to sleep, tolerating his actions.Zhao Nanyu was a scholar, but his strength was strong, so everytime he pinches her, it hurts to death.His lips gradually came close to her neck. When he was about to bite them, Song Luan could not longer hold herself, and opened her eyes.Zhao was not surprised at all. His lips hooked, and his smile was as fresh and beautiful as the green mountain after the rain. He said, \u201cAwake?\u201dSeeing that Song Luan\u2019s eyes were moist, his lips began to smile, but his eyes were still cold. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault that you woke up.\u201dWhen Zhao Nanyu used to look at her before, he would only feel sick, let alone touch her. But recently, he not only didn\u2019t resent her, but also bit her. He could also laugh when he\u2019s with her. Seeing her tearful eyes that were pleading for him like she was wronged, he felt that she was very charming.Although he said that, Song Luan didn\u2019t see any guilt in his eyes.The hyprocrisy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was not your fault.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t blame him.Zhao Nanyu was startled and murmured lowly. Song Luan\u2019s face was burned by his deep eyes. After a while, his eyes flickered away from her.The mooonlight was bright and the atmosphere was ambiguous.Zhao Nanyu suddenly leaned over and snuggled her, leaning on her ears with one hand, and looked down at her deeply for a while. He lowered his face slowly, and his lips almost touching her cheeks.Song Luan\u2019s pale fingers clenched the bed sheet and her whole body softened by his burning eyes. Her face and ears became redder as time goes by.The change on her expression naturally didn\u2019t escape Zhao Nanyu.He thought it was quite interesting. Song Luan, a woman who had never blushed in front of him before\u2013let alone was shy, was acting the opposite.The bright moonlight shone on her delicate face. Her skin was as smooth and delicate as a flower. This aroused Zhao Nanyu\u2019s inner thirst. There was a little desire to torture her.Song Luan panicked and pulled the quilt up, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201dZhao Nanyu suddenly reached out and clasped her back neck. His reddish eyes flashed like a wolf, and his thin lips moved slowly over her chin. When Song Luan thought he was going to do something to her, Zhao Nanyu retracted and let go of his hands.\u201cOkay, sleep.\u201d He said in a light voice.Song Luan laid beside him. Her brain was about to explode. Zhao Nanyu seemed to be very close to her, in fact, she could see that he didn\u2019t have those usual cold eyes. She didn\u2019t know what she did tonight for him to look at her like that.But this was still a good thing. Song Luan felt that his eyes tonight was much better than the first time she saw him.It\u2019s just that he pinched her back neck.It still hurts. Her mouth hurts and her back neck now hurts too.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s work and rest were extremely balanced. No matter how late he rested the night before, he would wake up on time the next day.When he opened his eyes, it was no surprise that Song Luan\u2019s legs were all over him. Her delicate wrist were tightly lock around his waist, and she was cuddled in his arms, like a newborn cat without protection.Zhao Nanyu looked at her and sighed. He didn\u2019t know whether he was sighing because of her kindness or her ignorance. In fact, he didn\u2019t dislike her very much compared to before. Song Luan had a sweet frarance on her body, and it was very soft to hold her in his arms. It was very comfortable.After he got up, he washed and changed clothes. After eating breakfast, the woman on the bed was still sleeping very well. He didn\u2019t want to wake her up, so he went to court.Song Luan slept so steadily that she woke up at noon. When she opened her eyes, she didn\u2019t see Zhao Nanyu. She was in a better mood. She got up from the bed humming and began to wear clothes slowly.She felt that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t look as cruel as he was written. He looked beautiful and delicate. Although his heart was a little bit evil, as long as you didn\u2019t offend him, he wouldn\u2019t treat you bad in his heart.Song Luan had calculated the time line. She hadn\u2019t put on a green hat for him. Although the original owner had touched Zhao Nanyu\u2019s anger, as long as she takes the time to remedy it, although she couldn\u2019t say that she would became a rich and powerful lady in the future, but her life would surely be saved. Even if her faith was death, she wouldn\u2019t die.Thinking this way, the fog hovering Song Luan\u2019s head swept away. The world was bright and the spring was beautiful.The weather today was also very good. It was cloudless and sunny.The warmth of early spring shone onto people\u2019s hearts. The branches outside the window swung with the wind, the small buds bloomed one after another, and the whole yard was full of the fragrance of Magnolia.The smell of Magnolia made people happy.Song Luan stayed in the yard for most of the time. She didn\u2019t go out much. Taking advantage of the weather, she planned to walk around the house.No one dared to stop her when she turned around to leave Huai Shui residence. The people who saw her could only hide one by one. They lowered their heads and pretended they didn\u2019t see her.Song Luan was angry. It must be that that original owner was too fierce with people in this household. She was famous for being unreasonable and vicious. People were afraid that she was still the same vicious woman so she couldn\u2019t blame them.Zhao family\u2019s reputation went over and beyond as this family was passed down from generation to generation. A powerful family with a good background naturally had a huge mansion.The hudge mansion consists of both East and the West. The East had five rooms. Among the younger generation, only Zhao Nanyu lived in the West. The only advantage was the quietness.After half a turn, Song Luan felt a little tired. The original owner was person with poor physique. She sat in the pavilion to enjoy the coolness. After she had enough rest, she felt that there wasn\u2019t anything to look at anymore, so she went back to Huai Shui residence.When she went back, Zhao Nanyu had just finished the affairs of Dali temple and went straight to the yard. Song Luan was shocked when she saw him. Zhao Nanyu would only visit when he had something to do, and in the recent days, he already appeared many times in front of her which was strange.Zhao Nanyu stood in the sun, with his elegant eyebrows and smooth eyes. His light pupil seemed to be soft under the sun.His eyes were slightly curved and his smile was shallow, \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dIt was clearly three simple words, but Song Luan felt unusual deep inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She straightened her back and nodded as if she had courage, \u201cAh.\u201dZhao Nanyu narrowed his eyes and smiled deeper. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201dThis question was obviously unneeded. This yard was full of his people. She can\u2019t hide what she had done or said from him.It\u2019s just that Song Luan hadn\u2019t realized it.Song Luan said to him, \u201cI walked around the house.\u201dZhao Nanyu seemed to believe her words and didn\u2019t go on asking. When he came back from the court just now, he heard that the servant girl said that she had turned to the east courtyard. At that moment, the violence in his heart suddenly rose.Before, she didn\u2019t turn around blindly in the house, but every time she carried a plan, she turned towards his eldest brother.His eldest brother was the eldest uncle\u2019s son. He was doted on since he was a child. In the past two years, he had been working in the court. With his good looks, it was no surprise that Song Luan would pick him, like a fish in the water.<blockquote>(Metaphorically, it means to get a person who fits in well with you, or a suitable environment as yours.) Zhao Nanyu is hinting that since his eldest brother had good looks and was doted on, Song Luan wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pick him since she fits in well with a person like his eldest brother.</blockquote>Now that the eldest brother was not in the house, she still went there. He guessed that she was there for someone else.Thinking of this, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes gradually became cold.Song Luan suddenly felt that atmosphere became cold. She looked up at him and swallowed. She didn\u2019t understand how the man became so sullen?She coughed twice, \u201cI didn\u2019t run around. I just wanted to see if the flowers in the back garden were blooming.\u201dZhao Nanyu followed her words and asked, \u201cAre they blooming?\u201dShe nodded honestly, \u201cThey\u2019re blooming\u201dPeony flowers in April were the best.\u201cOur son was called by the Old lady this morning. Let\u2019s go and pick up the child in the main court.\u201dSong Luan naturally followed him, \u201cOh.\u201dThe Old lady was very strange. She had a bad temper, but she was good to the younger generation. She was only critical towards Zhao Nanyu. If they didn\u2019t get the child back by themselves today, the Old lady might not return the child back.The husband and wife walked together one by one, the tall man and the petite woman, their backs looked like a matching pair. Walking along the corridors and then at the back of the garden, they arrived at the main courtyard.At a distance, Song Luan heard several familiar voices, which sounded like a mocking laughter.\u201cReally? My third uncle really scolded my second brother?\u201d Zhao Bo asked.\u201cWhy will I lie to you? Don\u2019t mind which occasion he was scolded or the look on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face. This time, second brother didn\u2019t know what made third uncle unhappy. Third uncle even pointed at his nose.\u201dZhao Bo was very interested in listening to this, \u201cWhat made third uncle so angry?\u201d\u201d \u2018Evil Son! You don\u2019t listen to your father\u2019s words. Like your mother, you\u2019re espcially deaf.\u2019 \u201d The man repeated in the tone of Zhao Sanye. There were even more unpleasant words he didn\u2019t say.Zhao Bo laughed even louder. He even fell into the rock, \u201cTo tell you the truth, his mother couldn\u2019t get on the stage. I heard that she wanted to enter the door.\u201d At this point, he sneered, \u201cShe didn\u2019t think of her identiy and still want to enter the door of Zhao family. She thought that giving birth to a son will solve it. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dThe two people talked more and more. Their topic were almost endless.Song Luan was frightened and looked up at the man beside her. She found that his face was neutral, as if he hadn\u2019t heard them. He was calm.A voice not far away was heard again. It was bitter and harsh.\u201cMy second brother is like a joke. His wife was not a fuel efficient lamp. She was restless to death. She already had a baby and still loves to come to my eldest brother\u2019s side. Really, we can see where her heart is.\u201d Zhao Bo said.Song Luan: What\u2019s this situation? She doesn\u2019t remember!When she stomped her feet and was about to explain to Zhao Nanyu, the voice continued to talk, \u201cJust now I head that she came to the east courtyard for a walk. She must have come to hook up with someone else again! My second brother\u2019s life is really sad.\u201dSong Luan was anxious after listening to it, hurriedly pulling Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sleeves, and angrily said, \u201cHe\u2019s talking nonsense!\u201dAs soon as the words came out, Zhao Nanyu was dumbfounded and Song Luan herself turned red. Her words were really not elegant.She yelled three times, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s dark eyes turned towards her. He fixated his gaze on her. Her scalp was numbed and she said subconsciously, \u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know!\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were still cold.As soon as Song Luan clenched her teeth, she burst out, threw herself into his arms, embracing him, and sobbed, \u201cI really don\u2019t have any! He lied! He wants to hurt me! Husband, you must believe me! Wuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu I\u2019m so pitiful wuwu\u201dSong Luan was afraid that he would not believe it. She continued, \u201cHusband, my feelings for you are very sincere.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s stiff hands slowly fell on her back, stroked her gently, and when he heard the words, he gave no face and smiled softly.Song Luan is so cute.So cute that he held her and wanted to hide her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Knowing the ending, should she just continue to wait until the male lead kills her? Was she desperate?She can be domineering, but in front of Zhao Nanyu, she was absolutely afraid.Her husband\u2019s voice was very natural, and his movements were as smooth as clouds and flowing water, no flaws were seen. Zhao Nanyu knew but had not exposed her in her little performance. He casually grasped her wrist, pulled her to his side, and asked with interest, \u201cHeaven and earth permits?\u201d<blockquote>Mostly used to prove the solemnity of an oath.</blockquote>Song Luan knew just how false her promised was, and how guilty she was! She hugged him and refused to let go. She clenched her teeth and pretended not to hear him.Seeing that she didn\u2019t answer for a long time, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s tone was not as calm as it was in the beginning. He sneered, \u201cSpeak.\u201dSong Luan had a bitter face and flashed all kinds of emotions in her eyes. She sniffed and stuttered, \u201cPeople change\u2026 I have only recently realized these thoughts. I\u2026 I.. I didn\u2019t lie to you anyway.\u201dZhao Nanyu said to her, \u201cWhat do you think of me?\u201dShe said with a smile, \u201cI admire you.\u201dIt\u2019s not a lie. She really admired Zhao Nanyu because although he was ruthless, he still shows affections towards his child.Song Luan tugged the corner of his clothes and looked up at him. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We need to wait for our son.\u201dShe was anxious to leave this place. Who knows what more will Zhao Bo say to slander her?Zhao Nanyu stroked her back with his fingers. He looked at Zhao Bo indifferently and smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s listen to it again.\u201dOh! Song Luan gave him a thumbs on her heart. His tolerance capacity was really strong.Zhao Bo chattered over and over about Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mother, and mocked his origin.Song Luan discovered a terrible thing. Even when he was humiliated by his relatives behind his back, he still had a shallow smile on his face. She could not see what he was thinking.After listening enough, Zhao Nanyu lead Song Luan\u2019s hand out of the back garden. When they got to the main courtyard, he released her hand.Song Luan looked at his back and frowned, unable to restrain her curiosity. She boldly called him, \u201cZhao Nanyu\u201dThe man was standing in the sun, looking fare and transparent. When he turned around, his dark eyes were fixed on her, waiting for her next words.Song Luan asked, \u201cAre you not angry?\u201dHe must have known that Zhao Bo had said a lot of bad things about him before. Today, he ran into Zhao Bo and didn\u2019t tear him. He was exposed yet he was indifferent. It\u2019s a pity to think about it.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s pupils seemed to ripple with layers of water that could not be seen through. She felt flustered when she saw them, and he smiled back, \u201cNot angry.\u201dSong Luan shuddered inexplicably. His aura was so cold. She really admired his ability to tell lies without his eyes wavering. Who believes? She doesn\u2019t believe him anyway.At the moment, she felt that the smile on the corner of his mouth was really piercing.In the evening of that day, Song Luan heard the news that, Zhao Bo, who mocked Zhao Nanyu this afternoon, was beaten by the Old man with a crutch. Now, he was still kneeling in the ancestral hall and still didn\u2019t come out.She thought to herself that most of this was done by Zhao Nanyu. This man\u2019s mouth was full of tricks, and he was not willing to be the one losing.Obviously, she didn\u2019t have the capablities to set up Zhao Bo to be punished.However, from what she heard, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t get any benefits out of it. She didn\u2019t know what he had done. Zhao Nanyu was punished by the Old man to copy the family law ten times. Song Luan had the honor to see the law of Zhao family once. It was a long volume which was enough to be copied once. If he copied it ten times, she felt distressed for Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand.Song Luan had no opinion towards Zhao Nanyu. His means were not too bright and showy. Afterall, he couldn\u2019t help himself, his father and his stepmother didn\u2019t love him. He could only use dirty tricks since he didn\u2019t have any power.She was more worried about her own situation. Although Zhao Nanyu was friendly to her and sleeps beside her, most of those times were not sincere. They were all pretend. It was no use sitting and waiting for her to die like before. She still had to take the initiative and win back Zhao Nanyu\u2019s affection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was only three points gentle in front of his own son. He hated the original owner, yet very good towards his son.<blockquote>Three points gentle means he\u2019s very gentle!</blockquote>He loved his son so much that even in the end of the book, he did not have any other children.So, Song Luan decided to do a good job in her relationship with her son, Zhao Zhi. Even without her motive, she sincerely wanted to know her son better. The blood relationship was so magical. It\u2019s as if she really experienced the period of carrying Zhao Zhi in her stomach before.It was getting late. The sunset glow in the distant sky was visibly bright red.Song Luan stretched out her waist, stood under the corrider, and casually asked the servant girl beside her, \u201cWhere is the kitchen?\u201dThe servant girl was stunned. She didn\u2019t understand what the Madam wanted to do. After a few seconds, she came back and said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the west side of the house.\u201dSong Luan nodded, \u201cTake me there.\u201dAs a young woman who lived for a long time, the only think she can do was cooking. It especially ranged from sweet to spicy flavors. She was self-taught.The servant girl timidly led her to the kitchen door, and Song Luan went inside by herself. The people in the kitchen were shocked when they saw her. The cook didn\u2019t like very much. In the past, the original owner was picky to the point that he had to toss away people just so he could satisfy her tastes.Song Luan coughed twice, trying to keep calm, and said slowly, \u201cIs there a vacant stove? I want to use it.\u201dThe cook laughed with a snort. Does she know how to cook? Was she not afraid that she\u2019ll be laughed at?Song Luan was not upset. Instead, she patiently waited for a reply.\u201cYoung madam, of course there\u2019s a stove.\u201dCook Fu pointed to the one beside him, his face expresionless, \u201cYou can use it.\u201dThe people in the kitchen were glad that they had just cooked their dinner. Otherwise, the unreasonable second young lady would bring trouble for them.Song Luan rolled up her sleeves, told people to prepare the ingredients and stood in front of the stove to start working.. She feels that her little bun likes to eat sweet and delicious pastries. This time, she planned to make some osmanthus cakes for him.Osmanthus, sugar, and flour were in front of her.Song Luan skillfully mixed the flour and cut it into small pieces of dough. Then, she kneaded it into the shape of a small flower and animal with her hands. It looked very lovely.The smooth movement was noticeable. Even the cook stopped his work and watched her. His eyes were shocked. He can\u2019t believe that she can really make it well. The way of kneading the shapes didn\u2019t seem to be to new to her.Some groups of people were thinking that they have seen a ghost.After steaming the sweet osmanthus cake, Song Luan did not bring trouble to the kitchen. She said politely, \u201cYou are all busy. I will go first.\u201dShe went straight to the front yard with her food box in her hand, while humming a small tune.In fact, it was very pitiful that her son could only sit in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study and play with dull toys without any company. Fortunately, he was sensible enough to not feel bored even if he only plays with those things. He was patient, just like his father.The window pane in the study was facing the desk. Zhao Nanyu was standing at the desk with a brush in his hand. He was copying ever word. After copying the whole afternoon, he didn\u2019t feel pain in his hand, or even thought of stopping.[Knock Knock Knock] Song Luan knocked politely before entering.\u201cWho?\u201d The word was so cold that it hit her head on like a stone wrapped in ice.Song Luan was stunned. She felt strange. Is Zhao Nanyu here? She thought only her son was practicing his own handwriting. If she knew he was here, she wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201d The tone of these words were not gentle.She opened the door and smelt a sharp fragrance, which appearead to be coming from the small incense burner on the table.Her son was sitting on the soft couch, holding a small wooden toy in his hand. His expression was simple with his delicate face full of innocence. The big black eyes looked straight at her.Song Luan\u2019s heart would always sprout every time she saw her little bun.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Zhao Nanyu put down his brush and walked straight to her.Song Luan raised the food box in her hand. \u201cI made cakes for little Zhao and brought them for him to eat.\u201dShe looked like a fox who came to ask for credit. She was a little silly in her playfulness.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were dark, with a deep smile on the corner of his eyes. He asked slowly, \u201cDid you do it yourself?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I remember that you can cook?\u201d\u201cWhen did you learn how to cook?\u201dIn fact, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t doubt anything. He only guessed that Song Luan took the cakes made by others, and did these to please him.The series of questions smashed Song Luan. In the face of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s deep eyes, her knee suddenly felt a little soft.She wanted to run.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one could keep calm in the calculating eyes of Zhao Nanyu. For a moment, she thought Zhao Nanyu saw through her. Her fingers that hid in her sleeves could not control the shudder. Her scalp was numb under his dark eyes.Zhao Nanyu saw that her face was pale and her limbs were trembling. He restrained his cold aura and became intrigued by her action. After observing her these days, Song Luan seemed to show fear towards him. She was not pretending to be afraid. She was really afraid.He couldn\u2019t help thinking, what did she find out?Obviously she had always been domineering.This is really interesting.Song Luan felt that she was going to faint, and her chest was stuffy, and was short of breath. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She must have been frightened by Zhao Nanyu. She managed to keep her mind steady. She squeezed the food box handle with her hands and felt cold from the bottom of her feet.Song Luan swallowed her throat, forced herself to look at him, and raised her chin slightly. She moved her lips and her attitude was neutral. She tried to speak in a foolish tone, \u201cIt was for the child to eat, you ask so much.\u201dZhao Nanyu was stunned for a moment. His eyes were deep, but he didn\u2019t feel disgusted with her change of attitude. She was like a paper tiger. He can poke her with a finger, and yet this little paper tiger thinks she\u2019s powerful. So cute.\u201cOk.\u201dSeeing that he didn\u2019t continue to ask, Song Luan was relieved. Her chest was not that stuffy anymore. She went to her son, placed the food box on the low table and brought out the sweet osmanthus cake.The crystal sweet osmanthus cake smells sweet and appetizing. Her son never seen this kind of cake before. The child was attracted by the sweet osmanthus cake. The two black eyes looked at the plate seriously.Song Luan smiled, pushed the cake, \u201cTry some.\u201dHe had a small toy in his hand, and his pair of big eyes looked at her foolishly. Song Luan simply picked one for him by hand, fed it to him, and whispered, \u201cOpen wide.\u201dThe child obediently opened his mouth, bit twice, and then swallowed. His voice was like milk, \u201cSweet.\u201dHe liked the sweet taste. It also wasn\u2019t greasy.Song Luan\u2019s heart was greatly satisfied. He reached out his hand and pinched his cheek, and asked, \u201cDo you like it?\u201dHe was reluctant to move his eyes away from her. The osmanthus cake was sweet, and the smell of his mother was even sweeter. He nodded hard, \u201cI like it.\u201dSong Luan touched his head again, \u201cYou like it.\u201dLittle Zhao burried his face and lowered his eyes. He was still embarassed to be close to her. He wanted to be close, but dared not to.Song Luan was still a little lost. She had seen her son being intimate with Zhao Nanyu and his uncle several times. But for so many days she was here, the child had not yet taken the initiative to hold her and pull her hand.Although it is understandable, she was still a little sad.But now it was better than the previous manner he had in which he dared not eat in front of her. Thinking this way, the depression in Song Luan\u2019s chest disappeared.Zhao Nanyu, who was silent on the side, suddenly smiled, \u201cIt looks delicious. I\u2019ll try it too.\u201dThe slender fingers picked a piece of sweet osmanthus cake lightly and bit it. It was sweet and not greasy. It didn\u2019t look like something she could make at all. He raised his eyebrow, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dSong Luan said \u2018thank you\u2019 very politely.Zhao Nanyu walked two steps forward. She was very close to him. She could smell the light fragrance that belonged to him alone. She tightened her hand. She didn\u2019t understand what he wanted to do.Zhao Nanyu held out his hand. He was a scholar but his fingers were very rough. His cold fingertips fell on her slightly hot cheek. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t use much strength this time. His fingertips carelessly scratched her skin, and because of her delicate skin, a faint red appeared. He was gentle and frightening. He asked, \u201cHow can your face be so white? Are you not feeling well?\u201dShe didn\u2019t say she was okay. He said something like this but she didn\u2019t know whether it was the psychological effect because Song Luan felt uncomfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was alive without typhoid or fever.The child who was sitting on the soft couch heard that she was not feeling well so he immediately raised his eyes and stared at her stubbornly. He was worried about her.Song Luan thought about it and nodded, \u201cJust a headache.\u201dIt seemed that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand had never been warm before. When he touched her, she felt like she would die of ice. After a while, he finally reluctantly moved his hand away from her face. \u201cThen go back and rest.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t hesitate to say anything. When she was about to leave, he suddenly grabbed her by the shoulder and held to the spot. The two people were very close. They stuck together.When Zhao Nanyu spoke, the cold breath swept down her neck. He said, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s spring, it\u2019s still cold. Next time you come out, wear more clothes.\u201dSong Luan straightened her body and said stiffly, \u201cWell.\u201d\u201cGo back.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe quickly rolled out of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study. It felt that one year\u2019s life would be lost if she talked longer to him. No matter how well he pretended, it was useless. Evil was evil. It was impossible to hide such things as grumpiness.It was still early when Song Luan returned to the courtyard. She moved to the rocking chair and lay in the courtyard for a while. She felt lazy under the warm sun, so she shook her head and went to sleep.It\u2019s dusk when she woke up. After she opened her eyes, her brain was still a little confused. Her head was heavy and her feet were light. Her nose and throat were a little uncomfortable.\u201cMadam, it\u2019s cold outside. Why don\u2019t you come in?\u201dWhen she opened her mouth to reply, her throat hurt. She said nodded, and then asked, \u201cHow long have I slept?\u201d\u201cMore than an hour\u201d The servant girl replied.No wonder it was getting dark. She slept for so long.At this time, her face was more paler than when she was facing Zhao Nanyu in the afternoon. She didn\u2019t seem to have any spirit. Song Luan\u2019s feet were soft. She felt that she was going to catch a fever because of the cold wind. She just recoverred from her typhoid fever, and now, she fell ill again.She held the servant girl\u2019s wrist and said weakly, \u201cGive me a hand.\u201dThe servant girl dared not disobey, \u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as she entered the room, she went straight to bed. The servant girl couldn\u2019t help but remind, \u201cMadam, have your dinner.\u201dSong Luan laid on the soft quilt. Her shoes was still on her feet and she had no energy to reply, \u201cI have a headache. I will not eat.\u201dHeadache and stuffy nose. So painful.The servant girl was going to tell her that Zhao Nanyu was going to come over for dinner tonight, but she had already wrapped herself up in a quilt.After Song Luan left, Zhao Nanyu did not continue copying the family laws.Little Zhao also stopped practicing his handwriting. His calligraphy was not good-looking. He didn\u2019t play with his toys, but instead ate several sweet scented osmanthus cakes in a row, even though he did not like sweets. When he reached for the cakes on the plate again, Zhao Nanyu stopped him, \u201cThat\u2019s your fifth one. You can\u2019t eat anymore.\u201dLittle Zhao withrew his hand and said in a low voice, \u201cDad, you don\u2019t want to eat?\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t like sweet food either. He smiled and asked, \u201cDo you like her so much?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d His son was a simple and ignorant child. When his mother began treating him well, he also began to like her.It seemed that the little bun was not afraid of his father. He climbed down and walked to Zhao Nanyu with his short legs. He held his knee and looked up at him. \u201cDad, don\u2019t you like it?\u201dSoft, fragrant, sweet, and always smiles to people. Doesn\u2019t he like it?Zhao Nanyu was quiet\u2026 silent for a long time. The color of the pupils deepened a little bit. All the darkness and violence were suppressed very well. He smiled, \u201cI like it too.\u201dSong Luan who was weak, sweet, and always tremble in fear when in front of him. He didn\u2019t know how but this fragile woman was really tickling his heart.***It was completely dark when Zhao Nanyu entered her room. The food on the table had not been moved and he did not see her figure.He asked in a cold voice, \u201cWhat about my wife?\u201d\u201cMadam said she had a headache and is still in bed.\u201dZhao Nanyu strode to the inner room. The woman in the bed wrapped herself tightly with quilts, leaving only the sound of her breathing. He sat beside the bed and pulled open her quilt, forcing her to show her head.Song Luan\u2019s face was red, and her beautiful eyebrows were wrinkled tightly. Her delicate body was soft and it stuck securely with the quilt. She was frail.Zhao Nanyu put his hand on her forehead. It was a little hot. She had a fever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was between half asleep and half awake. She felt that someone had helped her up, and her waist was squeezed roughly, and she grunted dissatisfiedly.Her body was as soft as a water, her nose was stuffy, her chest felt breathless, and it was uncomfortable. It seems that there were two hands holding her chin, and they forced open her mouth hard. An unpleasant smell reached her nose. She frowned, and tightly closed her teeth. She didn\u2019t want to cooperate.Zhao Nanyu had no patience. He tightly clasped her chin and said coldly in her ear, \u201cOpen your mouth and drink medicine. \u201dSong Luan would not open her mouth. She knew it was very bitter when she smelled it. Her body was uncomfortable and her temper became worse. She clapped her hands powerlessly, closed her eyes and hummed a few words out of her mouth, \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink!\u201dZhao Nanyu thought that he could see the shadow of the past, but this time she was not arrogant, but a little cute.Since she still didn\u2019t want to drink, he would use hard means. Zhao Nanyu pinched her chin with two long fingers, and with a little effort, he forced her to open her mouth. He raised the medicine bowl in the other hand and poured it directly into her throat.Song Luan was unable to stop the outflow of bitter tears. She drank too fast and resisted. She was choked by the medicine. And now, she completely woke up from her dream. She found that she was lying in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arms. Half of the black medicine was still in the bowl.When Zhao Nanyu saw that she was awake, he whispered in a warm voice, \u201cYou have a fever and need to drink this medicine. Come, drink the rest.\u201dSong Luan was in a daze. His tone was much softer than usual. It was sweet and sounded like a coquette. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink. It\u2019s very bitter. \u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem angry. He took out a handkerchief from his sleeve. He gently and meticulously wiped the medicine stains on the corners of her mouth, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be ill again, be obedient. \u201dSong Luan took the medicine bowl from his hand and raised her neck.[Gulu Gulu]She drank all the medicine.\u00a0Her face was paler and was not as red as before.After a long time, she still did not slow down. There was a rush of breath in her chest. Under the urge, Song Luan reached out to him, \u201cI want to eat candied fruit! \u201dZhao Nanyu was startled and smiled. He took two candied fruits without complaint and handed them to her hand, and finally touched her face. \u201cEat them. \u201dSong Luan\u2019s attitude to him made her regret. She thought that she had gone with the wind, and even dared to order Zhao Nanyu.She was in a complex mood and ate the candied fruit in her mouth. The bitter taste of the medicine was soon diluted by the sweetness. The medicine didn\u2019t work immediately. Her brain was still heavy and her complexion weak.Zhao Nanyu got up, stood in front of her bed, and said, \u201cGet up and lie down after dinner.\u201dSong Luan lowered her head and said weakly, \u201cI can\u2019t eat, I want to sleep. \u201dWhen she spoke, Zhao Nanyu had brought her a thick cloak. \u201cPut it on, you have to eat even if you don\u2019t want to eat. \u201dAfter a pause, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t be disobedient. Cover yourself with more clothes so you won\u2019t be wronged again with fever.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face was still grim. She reluctantly wrapped up her body with a cloak. When she got out of bed, Zhao Nanyu held her hand high and helped her. She said \u2018thank you\u2019 in a low voice.The food on the table had been heated. Song Luan had no appetite upon seeing the light and tasteless dishes. She wanted spicy and sour food! But she didn\u2019t think anyone in this family can eat spicy food. She never seen any heavy dishes.Song Luan suddenly felt that she was so pitiful that she couldn\u2019t even eat whatever she wants.She held the chopsticks and poked them in her bowl, and refused to eat well. This scene fell on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes and only felt it was funny. She looked like a child making trouble with her chopsticks.After dinner, Song Luan\u2019s spirit was not good. She yawned and fought with her eyes. She rolled back to her bed without looking at Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face at all.Zhao Nanyu stayed in her room for a while, standing quietly beside her bed, staring at her face and examining it carefully. Having seen enough, he turned away from the bedroom and stood by the window with his hand.The servant girl stood behind him, bowed her waist, and dared not to breathe loudly. She respectfully handed over a letter, \u201cYoung master, this is the letter sent by the young master of He family to your wife this afternoon. \u201d\\n Zhao Nanyu sneered, the sharp edge in his eyes could almost kill people. The youngest son of the He family was one of Song Luan\u2019s old friends. The man she tried to marry had also the surname He.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could not help but feel cold. The cold glint in his eyes condensed into frost. Then he slowly tore up the letter piece by piece.His voice was extremely cold. \u201cDon\u2019t let her know. \u201d\u201cYes.\u201d***Song Luan didn\u2019t wake up until noon the next day. The fever subsided after she drank the medicine and slept for many hours. She was not as sick and hot as yesterday.She forced herself to get up from the bed. As soon as she got dressed, the servant girl brought hot water to wash her face. When she finished cleaning, the servant girl called her, \u201cMadam, the Old Master Song\u2019s birthday will come in two days, and we just received the invitation. You and Master should come together. \u201dSong Luan guessed that this should be her dowry servant girl. She came from the Song Residence.She had no idea that Master Song, her father, was about to have his birthday. She coughed twice and said, \u201cOkay. \u201dThe servant girl was very happy, \u201cThis is good. The people in the residence won\u2019t gossip. \u201dIt\u2019s just that the relationship between her and Zhao Nanyu was bad.Song Luan felt it was okay. Anyway, her reputation was not good to begin with and It didn\u2019t matter if she had a thick skin.Although the servant girl was surprised, she didn\u2019t let go of her hesitation. She had been with her since she was ten years old. The young lady was arrogant and was easily swayed by emotions. She wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone. Her love and hatred were clear. Like was like, and hatred was hatred. She used to look at her father with annoyance. But in these recent days, although the change was not much, she rarely quarreled with her father, and even agreed to go back to celebrate his birthday.In fact, she did not dare to think that Song Luan would agree.However, it\u2019s better to come. In the past three years, the young madam and her husband had never been together in the Song Residence.When eating breakfast, Song Luan asked her, \u201cWhere did Zhao Nanyu spend the night?\u201d\u201cMaster went to back to the front yard. \u201dShe said, \u201cOh\u201d and didn\u2019t speak again.When it was time to have lunch, her son suddenly appeared in her yard with his short legs. There was no one around him. Under the sun, the little man\u2019s face was shining. He seemed to not be happy and pouted a little.Little Zhao startled Song Luan. She crouched down, her eyes were even with him, and said to him with clear eyes, \u201cWhy did you come here? \u201dHe walked two steps forward, but his feet were not steady. He seemed like he was going to fall on her arms. Song Luan caught him in a hurry, only to find that his shoes were on the wrong side. She couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? The shoes are all reversed.\u201dThe child was laughed at by Song Luan, and his face suddenly turned red. He was not ashamed. He lay in her arms and asked strangely, \u201cAre you ill? \u201dHe still can\u2019t call her mother. The tone he used was very respectful.He also finished writing the words that his father told him to finish this morning, and then heard from his father that his mother was sick. After that, he didn\u2019t have much energy and felt playing with toys were boring.Just now, he asked his father if he could come and take a look. With permission, he immediately put on his shoes and stepped on his little boots and ran this way.Maybe he was worried or maybe it was because of something else. He even wore his shoes backwards.Song Luan touched his face and gave it a light twist. \u201cOh, you know, I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dIn front of her son, her words began to increase unconsciously. Unlike with Zhao Nanyu, he asked her a question and she answered with a sentence. She even wished that both of them would be speechless so no one would talk.Regardless of her son\u2019s wishes, she picked him up and asked, \u201cHave you had lunch? Would you like to eat with me? \u201dLittle Zhao nodded awkwardly. His voice was very small and soft, \u201cYes. \u201dHe reached out his small hand and took the initiative to hug her neck for the first time. Song Luan picked him up at the same time\u2026 It\u2019s rare for mother and son to have such a pleasant and harmonious scene.When Zhao Nanyu came, the servant girls had just prepared the meal. Song Luan didn\u2019t expect that he would come directly without saying his greetings.Little Zhao sat at the right end and called out his father.Zhao Nanyu rubbed his head, then turned his eyes to Song Luan\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWhy do you look at me like that? \u201dHer eyes were so focused that it was difficult for him not to notice.Song Luan coughed twice and shook his head. \u201cNothing.\u201d She put down her chopsticks, calming down her accelerated heartbeat. She bit her teeth, looked up and said in a stiff voice, \u201cIt\u2019s my father\u2019s birthday in two days. Go with me!\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t want to take the initiative to open her mouth. It seemed very awkward. But there was no way. If she didn\u2019t say this, Zhao Nanyu will not take the initiative to mention it.She had to be fierce.Zhao Nanyu snorted, lips slightly raised, and he smiled more beautiful than not.Song Luan, whose eyes were fixed on him, felt very scared. Just when she thought he was going to do something, he replied, \u201cOkay. \u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t know what kind of attitude Father Song had towards her. To be honest, all the sons and daughters of the Song family in the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019 were all hateful.She sat on the bed and clasped her head angrily. If she could, she hoped that Zhao Nanyu would not go to Song family.The reason was very simple. The Song family looked down on him, and certainly no one had a good face towards him. But if he didn\u2019t go on his father-in-law\u2019s birthday, he couldn\u2019t be justified.Song Luan thought that her brain hurt more and more as she thinks. Ahh she yelled.She fell on the quilt, buried her face inside, and her pair of legs kicked in the air wildly.Zhao Nanyu got up much earlier than her. She thought that he already went out early, and so she flew around the bed without fear of being seen by him.But Song Luan didn\u2019t know that Zhao Nanyu asked for a leave that day. He didn\u2019t have to go to the court or go to Dali temple. After practising his sword in the yard, he still had sweat on his forehead. When he opened the curtain, he saw the person who was jumping on the bed. Her white legs were dangling outside the quilt, and her hair was disordered, like a little madman.Zhao Nanyu leaned against the door and watched her lose her temper. Then she smiled and sang, \u201cAre you so happy kicking your quilt? \u201dSong Luan\u2019s head rang with a buzzing sound. She quickly raised her head and stared at him with round eyes, \u201cAh?\u201dWhere did he come from? Didn\u2019t he go out this morning?She was stupefied but then regained her mind, fixed her hair, smiled dryly and said with small voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t kick them.\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t get angry. We can\u2019t be late today. \u201dHis indulgent tone was like talking to a child.Song Luan nodded and climbed down from the bed. When she was about to change clothes, she saw that he didn\u2019t want to leave, so she turned around and said, \u201cGo out. \u201dThe longer she got along with him, the more Song Luan\u2019s original claws and teeth come out. She was even a little smart and knew what can satisfy Zhao Nanyu.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go out.\u201d Zhao Nanyu put down the curtain for her very caringly.Song Luan\u2019s wardrobe was full of dazzling clothes, most of them were in the color of red. They were more gorgeous than the other. There were only a few plain clothes. It seemed that the original owner didn\u2019t even wear them, maybe because it didn\u2019t look pretty.She seriously thought about it. Finally, she chose a set of peachblossom qiyaoru* skirt. The bright color reflected her temperament better. If she had gone home today wearing plain clothes, she guessed that several girls in her family would doubt if she had any brain problems.As long as there were young talents and aristocratic ladies in the grand meeting, the original owner must dress herself very beautifully and should have a glorious appearance in the eyes of the public.After Song Luan had dressed up, Zhao Nanyu also told people to bring the birthday gift prepared in advance.He sat quietly, his long and thin fingers gently tapping the table, waiting patiently for the woman in the room to come out.Song Luan went out from the inner room and met his beautiful eyes. Zhao Nanyu stared at her intently.The makeup on her delicate face was carefully applied. Her skin was tender and white as jade. The gorgeous makeup on her face was not annoying this time. It\u2019s less vulgar, but it sets off her beauty incisively and vividly.Zhao Nanyu saw the shadow of the past from her face. She always liked to wear heavy make-up, and always wear the kind that can be seen at a glance.He nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. \u201dSong Luan\u2019s face was thick enough to resist his outspoken praise. Her ears were a little hot. She pretended to be calm and replied, \u201cYou are very handsome today.\u201dZhao Nanyu wore a blue round neck straight sleeve robe with a jade standing on the waist. The white jade crown tied up his hair. The lines of his lower jaw were sharp. After hearing her words, his lips rose slightly. It seemed that he was flattered by her.Zhao Nanyu pushed the things in front of him and said slowly, \u201cDo you like this gift to your father? \u201dSong Luan looked at it twice and said, \u201cHe likes it. \u201dZhao Nanyu prepared a pair of inkstones. She didn\u2019t know this kind of thing at all and couldn\u2019t see a way. Her father was a civil servant of the imperial court and should have a preference for paper, pen, ink and inkstone. This kind of gift was not shabby in the past.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He took a sip of tea and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Let\u2019s go. \u201d\u201cOkay. \u201cShe replied.The husband and wife had to take their son with them when going to the Song Family this time.

It may be that the weather was still very cold these two days since his clothes were packed tightly and looked more rounder than usual.He stood quietly on the side of the carriage in front of the house and waited. He stared at the toe of his shoes with big black eyes. When he heard the footsteps behind him, he suddenly became nervous. His fingers under the sleeves were tightly clenched. He was looking forward to something, but he didn\u2019t know what he was looking forward to.Song Luan touched his head. \u201cHow long have you been waiting? \u201dLittle Zhao had an uncomfortable face, his ears flushed red, \u201cNo\u2026did not take long.\u201d\u201cHow long is not long? \u201dLittle Zhao couldn\u2019t stand the teasing. If he couldn\u2019t answer the question, he simply won\u2019t answer, and he would not speak.Song Luan rubbed his face again, and sighed in her heart. The seriousness of her little son softened her heart. Her son was so cute!Zhao Nanyu looked at her, then at his son, and said, \u201cGet in the carriage. \u201dSong Luan wanted to climb up the carriage with her son in her arms, but she found it too difficult and gave up.It was much warmer inside the carriage than outside, and her hands and feet gradually warmed up. Her son sat beside her, while Zhao Nanyu was leaning against the window.The carriage was enough to hold three people. There were some snacks on the low table. It\u2019s used to alleviate hunger.The atmosphere was a little stiff since no one spoke. It was very quiet. Song Luan was brave and gently hugged her son and put him on her lap. Then she asked, \u201cSon, do you want to eat? \u201dHe touched his round stomach and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry, mother. I\u2019ve already eaten. \u201d\u201cOkay. \u201dZhao Nanyu suddenly reached out and picked a piece of red bean cake and handed it to Song Luan\u2019s mouth. She was frightened by him. \u201cWhat are you doing!? \u201dHe smiled. \u201cI think you want to eat.\u201dShe really wanted to eat. She didn\u2019t have time to eat when she got up early in the morning. So far, she was still hungry.Song Luan raised her face and refused to let herself lose in this moment. She rightfully snatched the red bean cake from Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand, put it in her mouth and muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feed me. \u201dZhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows after hearing this, but he didn\u2019t say a word. He just watched her eat silently.Little Zhao looked at them curiously, licked his lips, and thought to himself\u2026that red bean cake must be delicious. His mother looked so happy that he felt a bit greedy.His small hand secretly grabbed the corner of his mother\u2019s dress, as if it would stop her from running away.Zhao\u2019s house and Song\u2019s house were separated by half of the capital city. The carriage was moving slowly. Song Luan was already full. No one in the carriage took the initiative to speak. The rickety carriage made her drowsy. Her son slept right at her chest and and both pair of eyes were closed.Zhao Nanyu put down the book in his hand and stared at them quietly. Both mother and son slept soundly. Song Luan\u2019s hand protected his son\u2019s waist and prevented him from falling off her leg.Zhao Nanyu rarely takes a closer look of Song Luan. The marriage at that time didn\u2019t matter to him.Even after she despised him and brought endless humiliation, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t think there was anything, just a woman who liked to be scornful. It was hard to clean up her mess so he felt it was easier to crush her directly than the ants.Song Luan\u2019s flattery to him these days was not so obvious, but he was not a fool. How could he not see her intentionally showing weakness?Zhao Nanyu smiled. He looked at the woman in front of him carefully. The more he saw, the more itchy he felt. There was no doubt that her appearance was very beautiful. Her features were bright and exquisite. Her lashes were black and thick. Her red lips were slightly open. Her poor sleeping posture made her collar a little disordered.He held out his hand silently and arranged her clothes. He couldn\u2019t help it, his cold fingers slowly crossed the edge of her cheek, as if they were tracing her outline.The sleeping woman seemed to feel something, and her whole body trembled and frowned.Zhao Nanyu lifted his eyebrows and as if nothing happened, he took back his hand.Song Luan didn\u2019t sleep long before the carriage stopped in front of the Song Residence. Song Luan\u2019s father was very proud in the court ranking, so his birthday ceremony was very dignified. There were already many carriages parked in front of the gate.Song Luan listened to the voice outside and opened her eyes vaguely. She turned to Zhao Nanyu and asked, \u201cWe are here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe stepped out of the carriage first, then held the sleeping son on his shoulder with one hand and extended his hand to her. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll help you. \u201dThe couple appeared at the gate of the Song family. Everyone could see that the most beautiful third lady of the Song family had gone home with her husband. Her husband?!Song Luan felt embarrassed when she was stared at by the people. Zhao Nanyu was more calm, and walked straight.Song Luan held her head high and put on a cold expression. She walked beside Zhao Nanyu with pride.Song Luan\u2019s mother was Aunt Lin. She had longed for her daughter to come back. After knowing that she had arrived, she hurried to the front yard and saw her beloved daughter from afar.Aunt Lin rushed up and took Song Luan\u2019s hand and looked at her up and down. Suddenly she lamented, \u201cMy treasure! You\u2026 How much did you suffer in Zhao\u2019s family? The flesh on that small face is now thin, there is not even a decent hairpin on your head. Ahhh your mother\u2019s heart is aching. \u201dAt that moment, it seemed that Song Luan\u2019s mother was not badAunt Lin pretended to wipe her tears, and then moved her eyes to Zhao Nanyu, who was beside her. She glanced at his eyes lightly, but didn\u2019t say anything bad to him.\u00a0She just snorted and turned to her daughter to scold her. \u201cMy poor treasure. Since you did not marry well, your mother should have expected that your life will not be good after your marriage. Your mother didn\u2019t know that you\u2019ll be a mess like this. You didn\u2019t have beautiful clothes and jewelry and you can\u2019t even eat enough\u2026.My poor daughter!\u201dSong Luan: \u201c\u2026.\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled and listened, but his anger didn\u2019t show. Song Luan felt that he was squeezing her waist more and more hard.The waist was pinched so hard that it hurts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m doing really well.\u201dApart from the days when she was dying and lying in bed after being poisoned into the bone marrow, the original owner had a good life before she died, and Zhao Nanyu never treated her badly in food, clothing, housing and transportation.Aunt Lin\u2019s face was almost written with the words \u2018I don\u2019t believe\u2019. Song Luan\u2019s words did not comfort her, but they were darker and darker.She did not agree at the beginning with her daughter and Zhao Nanyu\u2019s marriage, but she had no right to decide.Aunt Lin was a daughter of a big merchant in the south of the Yangtze River. She was in a rich family. She had lived in royal clothes and jade dishes since she was a child. Later, Song Lian, the father of Song Luan, married her.Song Lian was a great official of the imperial court. It\u2019s very good that the daughter of a merchant can marry in. Song Lian treats her pretty well these years. He treated several children equally and loved them very much. Aunt Lin was not short of money. Her room was mostly adorned with gold, silver, and jewelry. When she was a child, she thought that having plenty of money was a good thing. She also taught Song Luan all these.Her own heart was not bad, but half of the credit for Song Luan\u2019s snobbish character lies in her. She doted on her baby daughter as an eye bead, and never scolded her if she did terrible things. Even if Song Luan made a mistake, she would protect Song Luan and blame others for her child\u2019s fault.Anyone can be scolded, but she can\u2019t be scolded. Anyone can be wrong, but her daughter can\u2019t be wrong.So even if Song Luan and Zhao Nanyu were caught having an affair, Aunt Lin firmly believed her daughter\u2019s beauty was coveted by Zhao Nanyu. Since he couldn\u2019t marry Song Luan on his own terms, he used this vicious scheme to tie her in marriage.What kind of person was Zhao Nanyu? No one in the capital knows. If his mother was a prostitute, it\u2019s not certain that this llegitimate son could go back to Zhao\u2019s house if his father didn\u2019t have an heir.Although he has passed the examination, he was not at the top. All the scholars who were selected together were better than him. He was really worthless.Zhao Nanyu slowly released the fingers clamped on Song Luan\u2019s waist. He seemed to know that Aunt Lin didn\u2019t like him very much. He smiled at her with a good temper and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the room to put this son to bed.\u201dAunt Lin could not wait for him to leave, so she nodded her head.In the past years, he and his wife also went back to Song Residence together. Sometimes Zhao Nanyu was called by his father-in-law to talk to him, so he couldn\u2019t take care of his son.\u00a0Song Luan was an impatient person when it comes to children, so she locked her son in the boudoir and before she left, she threw some toys to him to prevent him from going out.\u00a0Zhao Nanyu returned to pick up their son who was crying with grievances in her boudoir, so he was familiar where the place was.After he left, Song Luan was relieved, but she heard her mother\u2019s bad words again and remembered the people who hated her family.Aunt Lin pulled Song Luan to her room and looked at her with tears in her eyes. \u201cAh Luan, you must have suffered a lot at Zhao\u2019s house, and you even felt wrong. \u201dWhen did her daughter talk so well of him!? Just now that humble phrase she said that she had a good life, must be Zhao Nanyu, that man, who bullied her.Aunt Lin wiped her tears, opened the cupboard and took out a small box from it. Then she opened the box, which was gleaming of gold, silver and jewelry.Song Luan, who had never seen the world, swallowed, \u201cThis\u2026\u201dAunt Lin said, \u201cYou secretly take some back. Think about how to use it. I have nothing else but money. Don\u2019t be afraid of Zhao Nanyu. If you\u2019re in big dillema, just leave him. Let\u2019s find you a better man.\u201dIt\u2019s not uncommon for the people in this period to be open and remarry with divorce, but it\u2019s hard to say if she could still remarry with her infamous reputation. More importantly, it was absolutely impossible for Zhao Nanyu, who had a cold personality, to let her be happy.Song Luan had to maintain the image of arrogance before her mother, \u201cMother, I\u2019m not afraid of him! If he really dares to treat me harshly, I can return it two times worse. \u201dShe was lying to herself. She only dare to take advantage of Zhao Nanyu while he was away, not to boast with her mother.Aunt Lin thought\u2026 It made sense to think about what she said.A Luan has never lost a fight since she was a child. She didn\u2019t think Zhao Nanyu would dare to show his face, but she was afraid that her daughter would be wronged, so she took a handful of jewelry out of the box and put it in her hands. \u201cTake all these things. My A Luan should be exquisite and beautifully dressed!\u201dSong Luan silently put all these jewelries away and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s still mother who\u2019s the most important to me.\u201d She paused after speaking, and added, \u201cMen are dogs. \u201dAunt Lin was very pleased and touched her face. \u201cDo you have anything you want to eat? Your mother will personally cook it for you. \u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to have lotus seed soup. \u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll do it for you in a moment. \u201dSong Luan felt that the mother of the original owner was really doting in treating her daughter, and almost everything good things were sent to her.Her mood was very complex now, because Aunt Lin\u2019s fate in the book was not good. After her daughter was burned, the shock was too great that she died of grief.Aunt Lin was still not satisfied with her dress. She just put two more gold hairpins in her bun and a beautiful jade on her wrist.\u201cNow this is beautiful. \u201d\u201cThank you, Mother. \u201dAunt Lin said enough to her and went to the kitchen to cook lotus seed soup for her. As soon as she left, Song Luan\u2019s rigid back relaxed a little. She was really afraid that she would show her feet in front of Aunt Lin.<blockquote>*Show her feet \u2013 Show her true personality. So she had to act according to the original owner\u2019s personality.</blockquote>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She just passed the test.Just after Aunt Lin left, Song Luan planned to go back to her house to see her son and Zhao Nanyu. She knew in her heart that Zhao Nanyu heard her mother\u2019s vicious tone. She must also remember them on her head.It was not easy to brush some good feelings from Zhao Nanyu. Song Luan didn\u2019t want to be destroyed.However, Song Luan was totally unfamiliar with the Song\u2019s residence, and she happened to be bad with directions. She walked around indiscriminately and could not tell which direction is leading to which. When she finally saw a figure in front of her, and as soon as she was about to ask him for a direction, the man turned to her.It was a very young man. He was dressed in a blue shirt. He looked beautiful and soft. When he saw Song Luan, his eyes lit up, he ran straight to her. He was very happy and called out, \u201cAh Luan.\u201dSong Luan frowned and took a few steps back, while thinking who was this?! Listening to his tone, it sounded like they were old friends with the original owner.Not good! she wants to run.Without giving her any time to react, the man grabbed her wrist and said, \u201cAh Luan, I know you still like me. \u201dSong Luan: \u201c??? \u201dThe man in front of him seemed to have a lot of words to say to her, and finally he said, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the letter I received before, I wouldn\u2019t know that\u00a0you\u2019ll be in this difficult situation. A Luan, will you follow me once I persuade my parents?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s expression was struck by thunder. It took her a long time to find her voice. \u201cI\u2019m married \u201dThe man heard her and the hand holding her wrist were more forceful, and his eyes resentful, \u201cDon\u2019t you hate him?! Before you married, you told me personally that you didn\u2019t want to marry him. If my parents didn\u2019t disagree, I would have married you. \u201dAs soon as he said that, Song Luan guessed who he was. He must be the youngest son of the He family, He Run, who had a marriage engagement with the original owner.He Run\u2019s father was the emperor\u2019s uncle, his aunt was the current queen, his mother was the county head. He had two elder brothers and they were not easy to provoke. An outstanding family had raised a stupid son like him who was easily convinced.The original owner used some petty tricks to make him and his three spirits obssessed with her so much. At that time, He Run made so much trouble to the point of threatening his family with tears just so he could marry Song LuanUnfortunately, as soon as the incident between Song Luan and Zhao Nanyu came out, the marriage arrangement between her and He Run was broken.Now Song Luan\u2019s head hurts. What\u2019s this?!!She pulled out her wrists and said in a good voice, \u201cMr. He, forget about the past. I\u2019m having a good life now, so don\u2019t\u2026\u201dHe Run decided that she was wronged and didn\u2019t dare speak ill of her husband. He Run immediately interrupted her, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me\u2026 I won\u2019t let you stay in the fire pit of Zhao\u2019s family. What you wrote in your letter clearly says that you still love me. \u201dThe expression on He Run\u2019s face seemed to be hurt. He then said, \u201cI wrote back to you some days ago, and you should understand that I have never forgotten you in these four years. \u201dSong Luan was confused. She didn\u2019t receive a letter at all. She really didn\u2019t want to be involved with other men. \u201cMr. He, I have a husband and a son. It\u2019s not good for a man to act like this. You will meet a better woman in the future. \u201dHe Run was about to cry, his eyes were red, and his hands tightly grasped her white wrist. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. A Luan, we are in love. It\u2019s not your wish that you commit yourself to Zhao Nanyu. I don\u2019t blame you. Shall we start from the beginning? \u201dSong Luan listened to his inner rage. How could this young man say so much without listening to her?She couldn\u2019t move her wrist away from him. She shouldn\u2019t be soft. She had to be stern. Song Luan raised her chin, put on a look of arrogance, and said slowly, \u201cDo you think I like you? There are more guys that I like. As you say, I don\u2019t have enough on my hands. As long as there are rich and powerful men in the capital, I like them. I just like your family background, not you. \u201dAs soon as Song Luan finished saying this, the man behind the pillar quietly laughed, at the same time, his anger slowly poured up from the bottom of his heart.Zhao Nanyu silently raised his lips. He just happened to arrive just now and didn\u2019t hear much of what they said, but that last two sentence fell into his ears.It turned out that everyone can, as long as they have money and power.Yes, money and power are good things.With these, he can keep Song Luan from escaping in her lifetime.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s dark eyes stared at He Run\u2019s hand that was holding her wrist, and his scarlet eyes swelled with killing intent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he kneeled down and begged, \u201cI\u2026I\u2026.I have money and my aunt loves me. You don\u2019t have to worry about being bullied. \u201dSong Luan sighed heavily in her heart. After all she just said, he still did not give up. To make him so devoted and loyal, she didn\u2019t know what ecstasy the original owner fed to this man. He was deeply in love with her and never repented.She shook off his hand, and for this reason, Song Luan knew that he couldn\u2019t explain clearly. She frowned and said, \u201cMr. He, I have something else to do, so I\u2019ll go first. \u201dHe Run looked at her reluctantly, and even wanted to catch up to her, \u201cA Luan, I\u2026 I will wait for you.\u201dFortunately, Song Luan ran out fast, so she didn\u2019t have to continue to struggle with him endlessly. She ran out of the garden in one breath, when she finally saw a servant girl, she stopped and asked, \u201cWhere is my husband? \u201dThe servant girl felt that she was very unlucky. Third miss came back two or three times a year, and met her before. She was really scared of this bad tempered third miss, and was afraid of saying something wrong that would make her unhappy and get beaten up.She pointed to a room on the left, and replied, trembling, \u201cYour husband is in your room.\u201dSong Luan pretended to be impatient and waved, \u201cOkay, I know. \u201dShe arranged her clothes, followed the direction pointed by the servant girl and walked past. The door was closed and there was no sound in it. Song Luan doubted whether Zhao Nanyu was in her room or not.Zhao Nanyu came back one step ahead. His son was still sleeping. He sat by the bed for a while at first. Not long before, he stood up, and wanted to see her boudoir for the first time.He never seen it carefully even when he had been here before.There seemed to be a unique fragrance in the girl\u2019s room. In front of the bed, there was a dresser with a copper mirror on it. He opened the small drawer under the dresser and there were some household things, mostly for dressing. He saw several handkerchiefs in the corner, took them and puts them on his hands to have a careful look.Zhao Nanyu laughed. The workmanship in the handkerchief were extremely poor. There was even no embroidery on them. At first sight, he knew that the owner of this handkerchief was not good at embroidery.He silently put the handkerchief back to its original place, and did not continue to watch. He sat down and poured himself a cup of tea and took two sips.At this time, Song Luan, who was outside the house, pushed open the door and came in. Her face was a little red and some sweat appeared on her forehead. She looked at him and asked, \u201cIs little Zhao still sleeping? \u201dZhao Nanyu lowered his eyes and held the cup tightly with his fingers. He could not hear any fluctuation in his voice, and said, \u201cYes. \u201dHe suddenly raised his face and stared at her with deep eyes. At the moment when Song Luan was staring at him, she felt that his eyes were stormy, like a fierce beast coming directly at her.Zhao Nanyu got up and slowly walked to her side. He suddenly smiled, took out a white handkerchief from his sleeve, gently wiped the sweat beads on her forehead, and asked with concern, \u201cWhy did you sweat? Where did you come from? \u201dSong Luan\u2019s back was taut and her back was cold. Although Zhao Nanyu was very gentle at this time, she was still nervous. She smiled dryly, \u201cMaybe it was too hot. \u201dThe temperature in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes was a little colder after hearing the words.Several emotions, such as violence, murder and jealousy, were well hidden on his chest. He still smiled and no one could see anything wrong, \u201cRight? I thought you came a short distance from here? \u201dIn fact, Zhao Nanyu had seen many scenes where Song Luan was entangled with other men. Sometimes, it was an aristocratic son in the capital, and othertimes it was the person in the royal family. He could bear it every time, because he had developed the ability of turning a blind eye.But just now, when he saw the picture of Song Luan and He Run standing together, he felt angry for a long time, anger surged his heart. He was jealous and wanted to kill that man. He wanted to monopolize her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She nodded, \u201cI am thirsty. \u201dZhao Nanyu poured a glass of water for her and handed it to her, \u201cDrink.\u201d\u201cThank you. \u201d\u201cBy the way, did your mother say a lot to you? \u201dSong Luan wondered how much her mother said today, and that all she asked were all unnecessary questions. She shook her head, \u201cShe didn\u2019t say much. \u201dZhao Nanyu chuckled, \u201cHow did you come here so late?\u201d He looked directly at her eyes, as if to see through her heart. \u201cDid you meet someone? \u201dAt that moment, Song Luan thought that he had seen something. Her heart accelerated a bit. But after she thought about it, Zhao Nanyu could not have seen it. There was no one else in that place except her and He Run.She was not stupid, so she would not tell him what happened to He Run. Song Luan replied bitterly, \u201cI didn\u2019t meet anyone else.\u201dIt was really not an easy thing to lie in front of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes. She coughed twice and continued to talk with great difficulty, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I got delayed with my mother\u2019s matters\u201dZhao Nanyu was silent for a moment. \u201cI see. \u201dHis five fingers clasped tightly, forming a fist. Lying? Very well.\u00a0Sure enough, her changes were all pretend these days, her human nature had not changed.Zhao Nanyu thought of a lot of ways to torture her. He wanted to do it roughly\u2013to break her bones, to watch her cry and beg for her life, beg for herself. He wanted to kill He Run in front of her.Gradually, all these ideas were dispelled. It\u2019s not yet the right time. He could see his thoughts better than anyone else. He had treated her differently than before.Jealousy and anger would not affect him.He liked her pitiful look, full of grievances. He liked bullying her and looking at her red eyes with tears that hang weakly on that delicate appearance.Zhao Nanyu grabbed her wrist, on the location where He Run\u2019s touch was. He stared at it for a long time, then took out the handkerchief and rubbed it two or three times on her wrist. Facing Song Luan\u2019s blank eyes, he explained, \u201cIt\u2019s dirty. \u201dSong Luan took a breath of cool air. Her white wrist had been rubbed red.She still remembered the reason why she came to him, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t take what my mother said today into consideration. \u201dZhao Nanyu said, \u201cI didn\u2019t. \u201dYou liar! Her waist hurts so much because of him. How could he still have the face to say that he didn\u2019t?Song Luan could not expose him either, so she could only go along with him, \u201cThat\u2019s good. \u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t ask her what Aunt Lin had said to her just now. She just persuaded her to find a better man.Even when he hated Song Luan, he never thought about divorcing her, let alone now.Want to leave him and have fun with other men? She can\u2019t dream.Little Zhao turned over and opened his clear and innocent eyes slowly. The little boy got up from the bed without shoes. He stepped on the ground barefoot and rushed out.He didn\u2019t like this room at all. Every time he comes to the house, his mother would lock him up alone. He couldn\u2019t wait for his father to pick him up and so he used to wait until the sky gets dark.No one plays with him or talks with him.Song Luan was shocked when he saw her son dashing in full speed. The child in thin clothes ran towards her. She opened her arms and subconsciously caught him.Her son hugged her knee and buried his red face without saying a word.Song Luan picked him up carefully and asked softly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Why didn\u2019t you wear any shoes?\u201dLittle Zhao buried his head in her chest, but he still didn\u2019t say a word. He grabbed the clothes on her shoulder with his small hand, afraid that his mother would leave him and lock him here.Song Luan\u2019s collar was ripped open by him, and her white and soft chest showed a little bit. Zhao Nanyu glanced at it, then withdrew back his gaze, his eyes turned a little dark.He reached out his hand and carried his son. The child in his arms was still struggling. He whispered, \u201cOkay, be obedient.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s simple words could frighten him. The child was really obedient and dared not move in his father\u2019s arms.He raised his eyes, looked at her deeply, and reminded her, \u201cCollar. \u201dSong Luan found that her collar was pulled down. She blushed and closed her lapel. She dared not look up at him.Zhao Nanyu teased her, his beautiful eyes bent. \u201cWhat a shame, I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u201dHe licked his teeth and the dark light in his eyes continued.Want, Very want.Hold down her waist and do a lot of exercises together*\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fLegend:*You know what this means\u2026\u00a0(\u25cf\u00b4\u8278\uff40)\u30feZhao Nanyu wants fuck her so bad.

He had endured all these years, and he could still endure this time.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart and eyes were small. He remembered everything Song Luan did that made him unhappy. He remembered everything clearly, and he was waiting to settle everything with her.The little bun hanging on him seemed to be full of troubles. His chin was on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s shoulder. He was silent and no one noticed his grievances.Song Luan felt that his face seemed to be ucomfortable but she didn\u2019t think of the reason why she wanted he was making a face like that. She went forward two steps and looked at him with concern, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Not happy? \u201dShe bent her lips and smiled for a while, and even asked, \u201cWhy are you not happy? pouting face is not cute at all \u201dHe didn\u2019t want to admit it at all. He shook his head and said in a voice, \u201cThere is no unhappiness. \u201dHe was just afraid. He thought of the past, the days when he was locked up. He liked the mother now, and didn\u2019t like the one who didn\u2019t want to look at him.Song Luan couldn\u2019t help pinching his fleshy face. \u201cGood boys don\u2019t lie.\u201dIt seemed that little Zhao was still reluctant to say it. He took his father\u2019s shoulder and refused to make a sound. Song Luan didn\u2019t want to embarrass him. Even if the child didn\u2019t want to say it, it may just be a nightmare, and he was embarrassed to tell her.She smiled. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to say it, don\u2019t say it. But remember to wear shoes when you get out of bed. The ground is very cold \u201dLittle Zhao nodded and admitted his mistake, \u201cI\u2019m not a good boy.\u201dSong Luan touched his head, just about to say something, but Zhao Nanyu put him down in a flat tone, \u201cGo, put on your shoes. Don\u2019t do it next time.\u201dIt seemed that little Zhao didn\u2019t want to leave the two of them. Pitiful eyes looked at Song Luan for fear if he turn his head, his mother would leave, the door would close, and he couldn\u2019t find anyone.Zhao Nanyu, with a heavy face, said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t make any trouble. \u201dLittle Zhao lowered his head and went in barefoot to find his shoes.When Song Luan read \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, she thought Zhao Nanyu was very fond of his son. Now it seemed that Zhao Nanyu was not blindly fond of him. He was very strict and would never allow him to get used to his bad habits.She opened her mouth and complained boldly to him, \u201cYou were just too fiece with little Zhao.\u201dAfter all, he was only four years old. Zhao Nanyu could speak in a gentler tone.Zhao Nanyu raised her eyebrows, smiled and glanced across her feet. \u201cI remember you didn\u2019t like wearing shoes at home. \u201dHe had seen her running around barefoot several times.Song Luan\u2019s throat choked. \u201cThere is carpet in the room, and barefoot is very comfortable. I\u2019m not a child. What\u2019s the matter with barefoot? \u201dZhao Nanyu snorted. Finally, she could see some fluctuations on his always-cold face. \u201cLittle Zhao must have learned those things from yours.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. \u201d\u201cIs it possible to learn from me? \u201dSong Luan blurted out, \u201cHe likes you more and sticks to you. Maybe he learned it from you. \u201dAfter her voice fell, Song Luan knew that she said the wrong thing. Of course, little Zhao sticks to his father more, the original owner didn\u2019t treat him well.She bit her lips and took back her words,\u201dHe learned it from me. I\u2019ll never do that again. \u201dThis tone was very rebellious.Suddenly, there was a clear female voice outside the house, and the maid in front of her knocked on the door. \u201cThird Miss, Master Song asked that Master Zhao needs to go to the front yard. He had something to say.\u201dSong Luan replied, \u201cI see. \u201dShe turned to look at Zhao Nanyu, raised her chin, and said, \u201cYou heard that my father asked you to go.\u201dZhao Nanyu took a sip of water without hesitation and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dHe put down the teacup on his hands, the beautiful peach blossom eyes bent into crescent shaped, and said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t forget about our son.\u201dSong Luan cleared her throat and said seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll take him with me. Don\u2019t worry. \u201dAlthough she said this, Song Luan also knew that Zhao Nanyu would not be rest assured that she will take good care of the child. She had a lot of past mistakes. What if she goes crazy and mistreats the child again?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he thought that Song Luan these days was much different from the past and found her interesting, he knew in his heart that he still didn\u2019t like her very much.Her change was sudden.The time was not yet enough to trust her. But tonight, he couldn\u2019t help it. He had to go to the front yard and couldn\u2019t take the child with him. He could only leave the child beside her.Song Luan had better not lie to him, or he would add another stroke to his revenge book.Zhao Nanyu was silent for a moment, then laughed, \u201cThen you have worked hard.\u201dWhen he said this, his son who had just put on his shoes, ran out. Zhao Nanyu picked him up and said, \u201cStay close to your mother. Don\u2019t lose your temper. Be obedient, okay?\u201dLittle Zhao was uneasy and reluctant to let his father go, but he also knew that he could not keep his father, so he was obedient and said, \u201cOkay. \u201dZhao Nanyu himself personally gave little Zhao into Song Luan\u2019s arms, smiling, \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard. \u201dSong Luan was so flattered that she quickly waved her hand, \u201cNot hard, not hard.\u201dShe liked to spend time with her son! It\u2019s fun to play with him. And she didn\u2019t want to miss the chance to cultivate her mother-son relationship.Zhao Nanyu frowned a little. He couldn\u2019t tell whether the joy on her face was true or false. He opened the door and left without looking back.Zhao Nanyu just went out of the back garden when suddenly, there was a slim figure around the corner of the corridor. The girl was dressed in pink and looked like peach blossom. She walked to him and made a formal ceremony, \u201cBrother-in-law.\u201dZhao Nanyu was not familiar with the people of the Song family, but he knew that she was Song Luan\u2019s sister, Song Yu.He took a few steps back, very polite, \u201cFourth younger sister.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face become more and more red. Her eyes moved. She looked at him several times and felt embarrassed. Then she quickly lowered his head. \u201cMy father has been waiting for a long time. Let me show my brother-in-law to him. \u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t fail to see Song Yu\u2019s thoughts on him. He frowned and refused in a cold voice. \u201cNo, I know the way. \u201dSong Yu\u2019s teeth are about to be broken, and her face was much paler. She moved forward two steps and looked at him with watery eyes. \u201cMy brother-in-law, don\u2019t be polite to me. \u201dZhao Nanyu said coldly, \u201cNo need. \u201dAfter the words fell, he left in a big step.Song Yu stood in the same place with a stiff body and stamped her feet with hate. Brother in law is so merciless! She had just plucked up the courage to speak up, and he didn\u2019t even reciprocate.She was not Song Luan. Her skin and face were below Song Luan\u2019s. Song Yu was also a commoner, but there was not much difference between her and Song Luan\u2019s family in Song Residence.She had a common appearance, which was far inferior to Song Luan\u2019s exquisite color and beauty, and her literary talent was also inferior to her sisters. All of her sisters were quite mediocre with ordinary qualifications.She was cowardly and timid.After a while of sulking, Song Yu turned and walked towards Song Luan\u2019s house.Song Luan was sitting on the soft coach coaxing little Zhao. Her son hugged her tightly. She didn\u2019t know what happened to him.She felt that he was about to cry, so she asked patiently, \u201cDo you want to go out to play? \u201dIt\u2019s not good to stay like this the whole time.\u00a0He\u2019s too quiet. As a boy, it\u2019s better to be cheerful. Song Luan\u2019s heart broke looking at him.He shook his head and embraced her tighter, refusing to come down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dSong Luan sighed. If he didn\u2019t want to, he couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cThen we will stay in the house and wait for your father to come back?\u201dLittle Zhao hummed in agreement.The child\u2019s hands circled her neck tightly. It was the first time Song Luan was cuddled by her son. It seemed that he was afraid that she would leave him.Song Yu came around at this time. She smiled at Song Luan and cried sweetly, \u201cThird older sister.\u201dSong Luan knew her. Song Yu was a woman of patience and virtue.\u201cFourth younger sister.\u201dIn fact, Song Yu was very envious of her third sister\u2019s appearance. There were many men in the capital who liked her, and some of them were sons of excellent families. If it wasn\u2019t for that time\u2026She gathered her thoughts and smiled softly. She stretched out her hand to touch Song Luan\u2019s son, but didn\u2019t expect that the child would evade her hand.Song Yu smiled awkwardly.Song Luan explained, \u201cLittle Zhao does not like outsiders so much.\u201dSong Yu looked at her with complicated eyes. In the morning, she was told that she was coming back with Zhao Nanyu. At that time, she didn\u2019t believe it very much. Her third sister didn\u2019t like her brother-in-law. Every time she came home, she had many complaints to say. It was not only the family who knew their bad feelings, but also the people around them.But the messengers had said that they were so intimate that they didn\u2019t see any resentment between them at all.\u00a0Song Yu thought to herself, how could it be all of a sudden? No, it shouldn\u2019t be.And in the past, her sister didn\u2019t get along with her husband. She even didn\u2019t care for her child, and never saw her hug the child.\u201cI was abrupt and thought he was familiar with me.\u201d Song Yu said.Little Zhao grabbed Song Luan\u2019s collar and refused to speak. He didn\u2019t like the little aunt at all. He had heard several times that the little aunt teased her mother with other men when his father was not around.He buried his head on Song Luan\u2019s neck and said, \u201cMother, I\u2019m a little hungry. \u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just didn\u2019t want his mother to talk to his aunt.Song Yu pretended not to see his nephew\u2019s rejection of her. She stooped to approach him, and whispered, \u201cAuntie has delicious food. Do you want to go? \u201dThe child encircled Song Luan\u2019s neck, and didn\u2019t open his eyes. He is indifferent to Song Yu\u2019s kind smile. \u201cI want to eat the cake made by my mother. \u201dSong Luan chuckled a little, and soon she was back to normal. She always kept three points of arrogance in front of the people of the Song family. \u201cFourth younger sister, go back if you have nothing to do. Don\u2019t make fun of yourself here. \u201dThis was not pleasant to hear, but it was something that the original owner can say.Song Yu thought that the temper of third sister was a little bit better than before, but now she didn\u2019t think so. Her mouth was as sharp as ever, and her bitter character was really annoying!She was so angry that she had to swallow her stomach after almost breaking her teeth. She had suffered a lot from Song Luan. This elder sister was not only unkind, but when she was angry, this sister had slapped her face and grabber her hair. It was really not easy to provoke.If it wasn\u2019t for her motive of investigating, Song Yu would not come and see her. When did she ever see her quiet?She smiled stiffly. \u201cThis sister doesn\u2019t mind so much. \u201dAfter Song Yu left, Song Luan went to Auntie Lin with her son in her arms. As she walked along the way, she said, \u201cSon, I\u2019ll make cakes for you once we arrive home, okay?\u201dIf she cooked in front of Aunt Lin or other people in the Song family, she may frighten them all to death. They might think there\u2019s something wrong with her brain.Little Zhao calmed down, and was very good now. He\u2019ll do whatever she says, \u201cOkay. \u201dAunt Lin had just come back from the kitchen and cooked the lotus seed soup herself. She was about to bring it to her daughter when Song Luan came. Aunt Lin also saw her grandson on her shoulder.\u201cOh, little Zhao is awake. Come here. Grandma just cooked it. It\u2019s fragrant and sweet.\u201dAunt Lin treated little Zhao well. She had never been attentive or harsh to him. The child looked more like his father. He didn\u2019t talk much. He was obedient. This kind of grandson was not often seen. But, she could only care about her daughter, so her attention was not really towards her grandson.Her daughter was her own family, but her grandson\u2019s surname was Zhao.When he got off the ground, he climbed up to the table and said thank you politely. Then he picked up the bowl and took a taste.It\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s very sweet.Song Luan sat down beside him and took a taste. She almost spit out the soup. It was too sweet!Aunt Lin looked at her with expectant eyes and asked, \u201cLuan Bao, is it delicious?\u201dLuanbao was Song Luan\u2019s nickname. Aunt Lin liked to call her that when she was very young. When she grew up, she would cry and throw tantrums and refused to be called by that name. But occasionally, Aunt Lin would use this name once or twice.Song Luan swallowed hard the soup in her mouth and said, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dThe original owner liked sweet food, but she didn\u2019t.Aunt Lin beamed and said contentedly, \u201cI knew you would like it. No one in the Zhao family can make it. Drink more. There are plenty in the kitchen. \u201d\u201cMom, I know. \u201dSong Luan almost swallowed a bowl of lotus seed soup. Her mouth was full of the sweet and greasy taste. Her head and throat hurt. She quickly drank a glass of water to relieve the soreness.Little Zhao drank a whole bowl and didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Song Luan was curious and asked him, \u201cDo you like it? Is it delicious? \u201dHe nodded. \u201cDelicious. \u201dHe didn\u2019t lie to her. He really like to think it\u2019s delicious.<blockquote>If you remember, Little Zhao and Zhao Nanyu both don\u2019t like sweet foods. So when Song Luan asked her how it taste and little Zhao replied that it was delicious. He fully convinced himself that it was delicious (tho he doesn\u2019t like sweet things), so he\u2019s not considered as lying. Get it?</blockquote>Song Luan giggled, \u201cAre you still hungry?\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m full. \u201dSong Luan was afraid that his stomach would hurt, so she quickly took away the plate in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to eat just enough.\u201d***Zhao Nanyu was talking to his father-in-law.The reason why Song Lian was quite high in the court was that he was \u2018simple and honest\u2019. Of course, half of this kind of simple and honest was just pretend. He was the backbone of the Song family, so he was naturally careful.He was not satisfied with Zhao Nanyu, his son-in-law.Officials in the court were more or less snobbish. Based on his many years of experience in the court, he determined that Zhao Nanyu would not make much achievements in the court in the future. After all, he was his son-in-law. Even if he was not satisfied, he wouldn\u2019t mention it. Moreover, these years, he had been ridiculed because of his daughter. It should be regarded as compensation.Zhao Nanyu handed over the birthday gift he prepared to Song Lian. It was received by the housekeeper standing beside Song Lian. His father-in-law didn\u2019t even plan to see it. He thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring anything of high value.\u201cI have also heard about the foolish things that Ah Luan did. Please be more tolerant of her and don\u2019t worry so much.\u201d Song Lian said, thinking of her daughter\u2019s private meeting with a man two months before.Zhao rubbed his lips, \u201cI know.\u201dSong Lian also felt that he, himself, was terrible. No matter what Song Luan did, he didn\u2019t think it was her fault.\u201cI\u2019m relieved that you are like this. It is the best for the family.\u201dZhao Nanyu stood and his hands was on his back. His body was lean. His eyes fell down and covered the emotion in his eyes. The sunlight shining inward hit him, and his delicate eyebrows looked gentle.\u201cYes. \u201dSong Lian didn\u2019t say a word to him at all and just asked him a few questions as usual before he sent him away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw a lot of acquaintances in the courtyard. Many colleagues from Dali temple came. After greeting each other, he went to the backyard.The day passed quickly, and it was evening in a flash.Zhao Nanyu and Song Luan plan to leave after dinner at the Song\u2019s house. For the first time, Song Luan had not quarreled with her sisters. It was better to be safe and quiet. After eating the meal quietly, she didn\u2019t intend to talk to other people nor deliberately look for troubles.In the past few years, Song Luan could not help but stab them with shap words every year. The original owner thought that their laughter was mocking her, so when she saw her sisters laughing, she would use sharp words against them, and would not give up until both of them were hurt.Once they were about to go home, it was only Aunt Lin who was unwilling.\\n She sent her to the carriage while crying. She treated Zhao Nanyu beside her as air, wiped her tears and said, \u201cAh Luan, if you are unhappy in Zhao\u2019s family, you can go back to your mother\u2019s house. Anyone can be wrong, but you can\u2019t be wrong.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t laugh or cry, \u201cMother, go back.\u201dAfter all kinds of guarantees, she sent Aunt Lin away, and only then did she notice to care for Zhao Nanyu. She turned to look at him and couldn\u2019t help her curiosity. She asked, \u201cWhat did my father tell you? \u201dZhao Nanyu replied, \u201cHe asked some common things, and didn\u2019t say anything else. \u201dThe expression on his face was distant and indifferent.Song Luan calmed down a little \u201cOh.\u201dThe carriage stopped on the way. Song Luan opened the curtain and looked out curiously. There was a carriage in front of them, which happened to block their way.Song Luan looked for a while and was about to put down the curtain when a man came out the gorgeous carriage opposite to them. She decided to take a look, and could see that it was Zhao Chao\u2013the uncle who was close to her son.Zhao Chao came straight to their carriage and yelled from outside, \u201cSecond Brother.\u201dZhao Nanyu got out of the carriage. \u201cWhy are you here? \u201dZhao Chao smiled, and his handsome face suddenly became vivid. Today, he was dressed in crescent-colored straight embellishment, which looked quite elegant. He replied, \u201cI went out with Ayan to drink wine. Who knew that I would ran into my second brother. \u201dZhao Nanyu frowned, and his face was full of disapproval. He whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t take him to drink next time. He is still young. \u201dZhao Wenyan was only 17 years old. Although they didn\u2019t have the same mother, Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t help but also be strict with him.Zhao Chao seemed to guess what he would say, so he showed a vague smile, \u201cYou can\u2019t always stay at home and read. What can you do if you are stupid?\u201d Then he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, older brother. We haven\u2019t had a drink together for a long time.\u201dZhao Nanyu turned over and said in a deep voice, \u201cThere are still people in the carriage. \u201dZhao Chao made a sudden realization, \u201cIs she there, too? \u201dZhao Nanyu nodded.Zhao Chao remembered that today was his second brother\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s birthday. No wonder they took a carriage together.He smiled and didn\u2019t care. \u201cThen take her with you.\u201dZhao Chao also heard that the feelings between his second brother and her seem to be different these days. They even go out together.Zhao Nanyu thought for a moment, then nodded to answer, \u201cOkay.\u201dHe lifted the curtain and said to Song Luan, who was in a daze, \u201cCome down. \u201dSong Luan listened to him in a trance, and only after getting off the carriage did she know what he was going to do.Since the time she got drunk, Song Luan vowed never to drink in front of him again, but this time Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t give her a chance to refuse.He told the coachman to take little Zhao home first, and then grabbed her wrist and went to a restaurant.Zhao Chao booked a private room in advance and sat by the window. When he opened the window, she could see the deep lake not far away. On the dark blue lake, there were colorful river lights.When going to the restaurant, several men turned heads to look at her. She had a gorgeous makeup, and the color of her clothes were bright enough. Her beauty and excessive facial features became more beautiful with the makeup applied.It\u2019s no surprise that men stared her.Zhao Wenyan sat next to the window with his face in sight. Seeing Song Luan coming in behind Zhao Nanyu, he snorted twice. He was quite dissatisfied. He almost asked why she had come??!Song Luan\u2019s head hurts. Compared with Zhao Chao, the smiling tiger,\\n she was more reluctant to see Zhao Wenyan.In case this person was the same in the original novel, it would be bad if he fell in love with her in the future!As soon as Song Luan sat down, Zhao Chao pushed over a glass of wine and looked at her with a smile. He was as cunning as a fox, and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to offer you a toast, sister-in-law. \u201dZhao Nanyu suddenly took the cup in her hand and said, \u201cYou eat something first to fill your stomach.\u201dThen he looked up and drank the wine for her.Song Luan was flattered and began to nibble at the cakes.The smile on Zhao Chao\u2019s lips suddenly became meaningful. It seemed that the feelings of the second brother and the second sister-in-law had really improved.Could it be that second brother started to like her? As soon as this idea came out, Zhao Chao laughed.Although he couldn\u2019t see through his second brother, he didn\u2019t think he would like Song Luan.And Zhao Chao felt that Song Luan might not live long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t choose to go and become an official. He followed the master in Taoist temple to learn medical skills when he was a child.Now he had inherited his master\u2019s medical skills. He was now a famous doctor in the capital.Zhao Chao was not only good at curing people, but also good at poison. Three years ago, his second brother asked him for a colorless and tasteless slow poison. At that time, he joked that his second brother was worthy of being his brother. He was more ruthless than him.The medicine was called \u201cTianqing\u201d. When the second brother asked him for it, he gave it naturally and kept his mouth shut. He also asked who the medicine was for, unfortunately, his second brother didn\u2019t answer.The medicine should be given for three years, but his second brother didn\u2019t ask him for it again.Zhao Chao guessed that the medicine was used on Song Luan.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s drinking seemed to be very good, even after drinking two cups of wine, his face did not change. He didn\u2019t talk a lot in front of his two younger brothers. He sat quietly drinking.There was a strange silence in the room. He didn\u2019t talk to Song Luan, but she didn\u2019t care. She looked down at the cake in front of her, bored, and just counted the several pieces in the dish.Zhao Chao poured a glass of wine for her. This time, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t stop her from drinking. He just glanced silently and didn\u2019t say a word.Song Luan probably felt that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t like her very much, even if he had a warm and kind smile on his face, it seemed to be a little false.She straightened her back and never looked as humble in front of others as Zhao Nanyu. Song Luan behaved like a proud young lady, even the tone of thanking seemed so reluctant. \u201cThank you. \u201dZhao Chao frowned slightly, and seemed to notice she was unusual, but then still felt that Song Luan was not different from before, and was still that unruly and unreasonable woman.Not knowing shame. Not knowing manners. And was snobbish.Zhao Chao bent his lips and smiled, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen second sister-in-law for a long time. \u201dSong Luan\u2019s tone was indifferent and alienated. \u201cIs it? I don\u2019t remember.\u201dZhao Chao was not angry, but still looked at her with a smile. He had a face that made it easy to take off the guard. He said, \u201cI heard that second sister-in-law was ill some days ago. I don\u2019t know how second sister got better?\u201dSong Luan coughed twice, her eyebrows and eyes were light, and she replied with two words: \u201cJust Okay. \u201dThere were two reasons why she didn\u2019t answer Zhao Chao. One was that she didn\u2019t want to spend time with people who didn\u2019t matter. The other was that she was afraid of showing little intimacy. Zhao Nanyu might think that she\u2019s seducing his brother.Considering the whole situation, she was cautious. The only person she couldn\u2019t offend in this book was Zhao Nanyu, the male lead. It didn\u2019t matter what others think of her.Zhao Chao had no temper. No matter how he was treated, he was not angry. He opened his mouth, as if he wanted to continue to ask.Zhao Nanyu, who had never made a sound, glanced at him and said coldly, \u201cOkay, go drink. \u201dAs soon as he talked, Zhao Chao humorously closed his mouth.Song Luan was on pins and needles. She just wanted to go home quickly. She didn\u2019t want to drink or participate in the feud between their brothers. Especially now, Zhao Wenyan\u2019s eyes were still fixed on her, but his eyes were not very kind.Zhao Chao stopped, but Zhao Wenyan couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cWho knew if she was faking her illness?\u201dShe did this last year. She pretended to be ill and sneaked out of the house to have fun with other men.Zhao Wenyan\u2019s words aroused Zhao Nanyu\u2019s bad memories. He looked at Song Luan with a smile from the corner of his face. He gently stroked the fine hair on her cheek and said, \u201cShe won\u2019t deceive people. Ayan, you are speaking nonsense.\u201dZhao Wenyan just couldn\u2019t understand why he wants to protect her. What kind of protection does this sly woman need?He blushed with anger. He really wanted to scream at Song Luan!There was one time where she pretended to be ill and snuggled her head in his arms. This incident, Zhao Wenyan never told his brother about it.Song Luan smiled awkwardly, in a white-lotus voice, \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to, I don\u2019t blame him.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyebrows and eyes were crooked, his voice was clear and cold, \u201cMy wife is so mature.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face was red. Her red face had a special appeal and charm. The candle lights brought out her bright and lustrous eyes. Her eyes seemed to be shining with water, and her ears were burning red. She drank a glass of water before she put down the heat in her heart.Zhao Wenyan was very angry. He poured down his glass of wine and didn\u2019t know who he was venting his anger to. He was young and was not good at drinking.At the end of drinking, he was not very conscious. His face was red. He didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.Song Luan\u2019s back was always taut, and her eyes were not on him from the beginning to the end. Because of this, she didn\u2019t know that he touched his nerve. When Song Luan was about to leave, Zhao Wenyan suddenly rushed to her and scolded her angrily, \u201cYou shameless.\u201dHe was a young scholar. He had never done such a rude thing as swearing.Song Luan was scolded. Naturally, he didn\u2019t have a good face for her, so he immediately scolded her and went back, \u201cYou are shameless.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t wear too much in front of me and deliberately fall on me to seduce me.\u201d As soon as this sentence reached the throat, Zhao Wenyan was dragged away by Zhao Chao.Song Luan had more or less two drinks tonight. The wine encouraged people\u2019s courage. Her courage was a little bigger than usual, so she rushed to scratch his face and pulled his hair like a shrew.Zhao Nanyu grabbed her wrists with quick eyes and hands, and smiled shallowly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201dAs soon as Song Luan saw him, she stopped making noise, and was quietly led down the restaurant by his wrist.Zhao Chao took the drunk Zhao Wenyan to the carriage first, and Song Luan followed Zhao Nanyu back to the Song Residence.In the dark of night, the wind is cold and stirred her ears. The cold wind slapped on her face, and Song Luan became sober from her drunkenness. Her brain was still dizzy, and her feet were soft.She was actually a very lazy person. If she could sit down, she would never want to stand up.The moonlight lengthened the reflection of the two people. Zhao Nanyu walked very fast. Song Luan struggled to keep up with him. Her feet hurt after walking for a long time.This body was very delicate.She panted and followed Zhao Nanyu. Her heels were worn and hurt.They were the only person in the street. Song Luan burst into tears at the corner of her eyes and got up. Her short temper coming out. She stood in the same place and didn\u2019t know who she was angry with. \u201cI won\u2019t go! \u201dZhao Nanyu heard the movement behind him, turned around, and the moonlight fell half on his bright face, and slightly closed his chin. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? \u201dSong Luan wiped her eyes and said, \u201cI can\u2019t walk. \u201dShe pouted and her face was not happy. Zhao Nanyu looked at her like this. For a moment, he was distracted. He thought that she was very tempting and delicious.\u201cIt\u2019s not far. \u201dSong Luan pointed to her left foot. Afraid that he would not believe it, she bent down and took off her shoes and socks, stretched out his bare feet and pointed to his heels. \u201cYou see, my skin is all worn out!\u201dZhao Nanyu was shocked by her astonishing behavior. He froze, squatted down, and place her foot in the palm of his hand. He wiped the blood on her heel, put on her shoes and socks, and stared at her with black eyes. His voice was very cold. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to take off your shoes outside.\u201d<blockquote>You guys should know that historically, showing one\u2019s feet is a sign of intimacy. A wife should only show her feet to her husband.</blockquote>It was also because no one was in the middle of the night. If someone looked at it, he would dig the eyeball of the man.Song Luan did this because she was a little drunk. Her mind was somewhat sober. After having suffered, she settled down and said, \u201cOh. \u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t say anything. He squatted down and carried her on his back.Song Luan fell on his back, hands around his neck, and the faint breath from her nose sprinkled on his neck, which smelled sweet.She tilted her head, squinted and stared at him motionless. Her eyes slowly climbed up from his chin. His face was very delicate. She liked his nose and eyebrows.Song Luan was stunned. In a trance, she reached out her finger and touched his face. Zhao Nanyu stopped for a moment. His face was still clear and cold. He held her waist in one hand and stopped her fingers in the other hand. He whispered, \u201cBe good. \u201dWhen Song Luan heard his voice, she did not move. She was incredibly well-behaved so she withdrew her finger and understood. \u201cOh.\u201dShe wanted to say that she had listened to him intently, but dared not speak out.Song Luan suddenly laughed and called out his name, \u201cZhao Nanyu. \u201dHe continued to walk forward with her on his back, listening attentively. His voice was hoarse, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? \u201dSong Luan\u2019s thin legs were tied to his waist. She moved around him. Her snow-white and soft chest rubbed against him. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s breathing gradually increased and said dumbly, \u201cDon\u2019t move. \u201dSong Luan was not obedient this time. She laughed and blowed in his ear, \u201cDo you like me? Hmm?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was taut and silent.Song Luan\u2019s face was filled with laughter, and she exhaled, saying: \u201cAm I not beautiful enough? Or is my figure not good enough? Don\u2019t you like it?\u201dIsn\u2019t she seducing? She didn\u2019t know.Zhao Nanyu carried her back home, and the people under the vigil were shocked when they saw the appearance of their young master and his wife. They hurriedly avoided their eyes and dared not to look at his wife more.Zhao Nanyu rudely kicked the door open and threw the woman on the bed. Song Luan was slightly drunk, her clothes were messy, and her white neck was a little red. It was really charming.He tightened his jaw, his face expressionless, but the voice in his throat was hoarse, \u201cYou are drunk. \u201dSong Luan was not drunk. Seeing that he wouldn\u2019t\u00a0flirt with her, she simply rolled up the quilt and wrapped herself tightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t like me.\u201dNevermind. I don\u2019t like you anyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enjoy the chapter! <3\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fTranslated by: TinkerSong Luan didn\u2019t expect to ask Zhao Nanyu what she wanted. She didn\u2019t think Zhao Nanyu would like her.\u00a0Song Luan acted on a whim. She tried to seduce him to see how he would react. As expected, his concentration was very good. He was not moved by her at all, his face didn\u2019t blush, his heart was not jumping, his eyes were still cold, and his face had not changed.She felt bored. Zhao Nanyu really was exactly the same as the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019. He was not close to women and had a cold personality. If he had to treat a woman differently, it would be because he had motives.So it\u2019s not too much to say that he\u2019s heartless.Song Luan took off her shoes, socks and coat. She jumped to bed, wrapped herself in a cocoon, rolled around, and went to sleep.Zhao Nanyu sat beside the bed and gazed at her quietly. His white fingers slightly touched her cheek. The color of his pupils deepened gradually, and the corners of his lips rose little by little.He didn\u2019t see that she had no heart for him.***It\u2019s early in the summer, and it was getting hotter and hotter. In this period of time, she seldom saw Zhao Nanyu. He was too busy that she didn\u2019t see him. Song Luan could guess what he was busy about.In this year, the male lead took sides with the sixth prince. Since then, he began to show himself in the court.\u00a0At last, the sixth prince fought hard in a fierce battle of seizing the crown. Zhao Nanyu made a lot of efforts and strategies. When the new emperor ascended the throne, he also became an important minister in power.It\u2019s less than a year before the new emperor ascended the throne. That is to say, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s first day was not far away.It\u2019s wasn\u2019t just Song Luan\u2019s self-love, but she really thinks that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t have the same intention to kill her as before. Occasionally, she could even see kindness in his eyes.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t show up much. She was happy.On this day, Third Lady Zhao suddenly called her over and asked her to have lunch together.Third lady Zhao, Zhao Wenyan\u2019s biological mother, was devoted to Buddhism. During the holidays, she even wished that Zhao Nanyu, the \u2018son\u2019 would not ask her to greet her. The gloominess of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s body was too heavy that she didn\u2019t lke it.Song Luan wore gold and silver, and went slowly to the third lady\u2019s house of the West courtyard while wearing a gorgeous makeup. The lunch had been prepared. When third lady raised her eyes, she saw a woman with a golden light and heavy makeup. She frowned immediately, thinking that Song Luan had not made any progress for the past several years.Third lady Zhao sighed heavily in her heart. She couldn\u2019t take this daughter-in-law. She dared not to scold her. Song Luan was not only arrogant, but also had a bad temper. She could hit with a dozen of insulting words.When she cried, she brought troubles. If she was aggrieved, she would make a fuss and wanted to go back to her family.Her eyes hurt when she saw her. She did not dare to call people until she was ready. She smiled and said, \u201cAh Luan, sit down. \u201dSong Luan sat opposite to her, and there was an unfamiliar woman sitting on the table. Third lady Zhao said, \u201cThis is Ruoyun, a girl from the Yang family in Suzhou. \u201dAh her real daughter.Yang Ruoyun\u2019s was also very beautiful. She had a small and delicate face. Always smiling.Song Luan nodded her head and said her greetings.In the original book, Yang Ruoyun was a very important person. She was the second female lead in this book. She was infatuated with the male lead. Every year, Yang Ruoyun would live in Zhao\u2019s house for a period of time. She liked to follow the man when she was a child and wanted to marry him when she grew up.As a matchmaker, Song Luan thinks that she was a very smart. Because the male lead likes the simple and timid little white rabbit, she silently guarded the male lead by the side, and bore no grudges. She did not seek fame or score.Yang Ruoyun grasped the fact that the original owner didn\u2019t like the male lead. She got close to the original owner slowly, and blowed in her ears to leave the male lead. If her plan didn\u2019t work, she would make another plan, and would instigate the original owner to go out to find a man, which completely annoyed the male lead and resulted to Song Luan\u2019s losing her life.\u201cGood cousin.\u201d Yang Ruoyun smiled at her sweetly.Song Luan also smiled, \u201cCousin is also good.\u201dAt this moment, her heart suddenly gave birth to a feeling that Zhao Nanyu and Yang Ruoyun were very matched. The cruel young master and the scheming infatuated girl were a good couple!In the book \u201cThe Powerful Minister\u201d, it was written that the man liked the kind of delicate woman who knew how to act coquettishly, cries and chirps.\u00a0Song Luan thought that maybe all men can\u2019t escape the desire of conquest and protection.The delicate and weak girl could arouse the protection of men.Third lady Zhao really didn\u2019t know her daughter\u2019s thoughts on Zhao Nanyu, and Song Luan knew that she didn\u2019t have any plans to send her as a concubine to Zhao Nanyu. In the book, she made every way to convince her mother to allow her to become Zhao Nanyu\u2019s concubine.Song Luan pretended to be worried, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThird lady Zhao then said, \u201cAll the families in the Song Residence are getting bigger, only our third family is weak. The eldest in our third family was born prematurely, weak in body and bones, and often ill.\u201dWhen she paused, she took out her veil and wiped the water from the corner of her eyes. Then she continued, \u201cNow that your son is four years old, you and Ah Yu need another one, right? \u201dThis is not what she wanted to say. She didn\u2019t care at all. It was the old lady who asked to call her.\u00a0The old lady hated Zhao Nanyu, but she was very fond of his son. She was very sad that little Zhao was alone at home and had no one to accompany him. In addition, other married couples had more than one child, so she inevitably wanted to urge her.Third lady Zhao could see that Song Luan was not interested in Zhao Nanyu, let alone liked him. She also heard that it was an accident when she conceived little Zhao. After four years of marriage, they had nothing to do with each other, and both were not in love.Song Luan thought that third lady Zhao was going to make a bridge for Yang Ruoyun. She already figured out what she was going to do.She would lose her temper first and then agree unwillingly. If a man had more women, there would be no time to take care of her. How nice!But, even this third lady Zhao was pushing her to have a baby with Zhao Nanyu?!Oh my god.Song Luan was embarassed to tell them that they almost never share a room. After she transmigrated, she did sleep beside Zhao Nanyu many times. It seems they gotten closer. But Zhao Nanyu never touched her. He had no desire for her just like a monk with a clear heart and few desires.\u00a0She had reason to guess that Zhao Nanyu had never touched her again in the past four years. So one by one, the original owner would look for a man outside!In this case, how could they have children?Song Luan said with a dry smile, \u201cChildren matters would naturally just follow.\u201dThird lady Zhao was disappointed to hear what she said. She didn\u2019t want to take care of their affairs. Unfortunately, the old lady said that she had to take care of them even if she didn\u2019t want to.\u201cI can see that the relationship between you and your husband had improved a lot these days. It should not be difficult to have a child at this time.\u201d The third lady must have misunderstood her. She might have thought that she didn\u2019t have Zhao Nanyu in her heart and didn\u2019t want to give birth to a child for him. In those days, she didn\u2019t get a long with her son well.When Song Luan got pregnant in the month of October, she lost her temper easily in Zhao\u2019s family. She was crying and smashing things, which made Zhao\u2019s family uneasy.Song Luan had the cheek to pretend that she could not understand her words. \u201cNaturally fate comes when the child comes.\u201dYang Ruoyun, who was sitting beside, even opened her mouth to help her out. \u201cMy aunt, cousin is right. It depends on fate.\u201dOf course, Yang Ruoyun didn\u2019t want her to have another one. She expected Song Luan to make trouble without reason every day. Song Luan thoroughly annoyed Zhao Nanyu and alienated their husband and wife relationship.She was worried that she would touch Song Luan\u2019s temper, so she sighed, \u201cSince you say that, next month, I will go to the temple with you to ask for a sign. Bodhisattva will see your heart. Maybe the child come sincerely.\u201dSeeking a Bodhisattva? Might as well beg Zhao Nanyu.He was simply not a normal man. He had good restraint and was frightening. If he didn\u2019t touch, he would never touch.Song Luan pretended to be stupid. \u201cOkay.\u201dThird lady Zhao didn\u2019t plan on doing anything. Even though she knew that Song Luan had gone to the temple, she knew she didn\u2019t really want to ask for a son.After saying a few words, third lady Zhao also found that Song Luan was not the same as before. She used to be beautiful, but she was too arrogant and sharp, and was unreasonable. Today, looking at her, she seemed to have calmed down. Her temperament seemed to be much better.In the twinkling of an evening, Song Luan began to go back, and third lady Zhao didn\u2019t ask for her to stay.Third lady Zhao looked at her for several times, then she finally couldn\u2019t help but remind her, \u201cAh Luan, you\u2026You\u2019d better break with other men from now on. Don\u2019t have any thoughts that you shouldn\u2019t have. Nan Yu\u2026he\u2026he\u2019s not someone who should be provoked.\u201dA long time ago, third lady Zhao saw Zhao Nanyu, a child with extraordinary means. He was cruel and did not give people a chance to breathe.Zhao Nanyu must know the things behind the deeds of Song Luan.Song Luan thought that what she said was right. Her head was like a pounding garlic. \u201cUh, uh, you\u2019re right.\u201dShe decided to walk around when she saw a familiar man!Song Luan still despised the original owner\u2019s ability.In the evening, just after she returned to her yard, she listened to the servant girl\u2019s hesitation and said a man came to the door and happened to meet Zhao Nanyu, who came back from the palace. The man was brave enough not to let him in, and even shouted outside the door and wanted to see Song Luan.Zhao Nanyu immediately kicked him and hit the man against the post. He vomited blood.Cold air crawled down Song Luan\u2019s back. She was afraid to die tonight!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reason for his fame was that he looked good and his facial features were small and delicate. Especially his eyes that seem to speak. They were more beautiful than the others.When he was first sold into Hanchunlou, many wealthy merchants from the North wanted to buy him at a high price. Most of them were barbarians. His first owner bought him to humiliate and beat him up. Huai Jin suffered a lot at first, but later was taken by Song Luan. He was relieved. At least she looked like a normal woman and should be very easy to deal with.Song Luan spent almost all her dowry to buy Huai Jin. But no matter how brave she was, she couldn\u2019t bring him back to Zhao\u2019s house, so Huai Jin still lived outside these years.Song Luan didn\u2019t buy him to do that. She just liked people with good looks. Every time she came to Huai Jin to drink with him, she didn\u2019t do anything else.Huai Jin came here because Song Luan hadn\u2019t been outside for a long time. He was always worried about what happened to her. He heard that the Zhao Nanyu and Song Luan\u2019s relationship improved recently. He thought what he heard was just a joke because Song Luan had said to him many times that she hate her husband. She thought it was Zhao Nanyu\u2019s plan that she was forced to marry him after being drugged, so she had a lot of dissatisfaction towards Zhao Nanyu.Huai Jin didn\u2019t expect to meet her husband on her first visit. He had been living in the city for so many years. He was also very shrewd and fearless.Zhao Nanyu stood under the steps with his back hand and looked at him silently for a long time. His eyes were as black as the deep pool, and the corners of his mouth pulled up. He smiled and asked, \u201cWho is this?\u201dNo one dared to tell him the truth. Everyone lowered their heads and refused to make a sound. The servant looked at them, and they hurriedly bowed their heads.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s lips fell slowly, his eyes were cold, and his voice suddenly cooled. He snapped, \u201cAre you all mute?\u201dThe servant and the others trembled with fright. They were cold all over. In the hot and dry day, their backs were sweating.Huai Jin and Song Luan looked to be in cahoots. So, they were doomed together. Who wouldn\u2019t have the foresight that they were awaiting death? So, Huai Jin said, \u201cWho am I? Do you really not know, Mr. Zhao? \u201dZhao Nanyu stepped with his black boots and stood three steps away from him. He bent his mouth. His cold vision swept across his face in an instant. He said clearly, \u201cAre you worthy for me to know you?\u201dAs soon as the words fell, he raised his foot and kicked his chest. The kick was so fierce that no one would think it came from a scholar. Huai Jin was kicked away by him immediately. His back hit the doorpost severely. There was a burst of pain in his internal organs, and bood slowly flowed down from his lips.Zhao Nanyu looked at him as if he was looking at a dead thing. He patted his lapel gracefully, raised his lips with a chuckled. \u201cServants, see him off.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201dHuai Jin stood up and rubbed the blood on the corners of his mouth with his hands. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll go by myself.\u201dThis dog man. He\u2019s really cruel. It\u2019s no wonder Ah Luan didn\u2019t like him. Rude men are nothing good.Yuck. Yuck.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyebrows and heart jumped abruptly. His fierce anger was forced into his heart. His face was completely dark. He went straight to the backyard without saying a word. In the middle of the walk, he stopped suddenly and went back to his study first.He had to calm down. Although now he wanted to do something unusual to Song Luan so that she would remember, but it was not yet the time.Zhao Nanyu was clear about Huai Jin\u2019s details. The two had met several times, and he knew what they said and did each time.After he became more and more interested in Song Luan, he could not be indifferent, and this kind of act irritated him.***Song Luan wandered around the room anxiously. She didn\u2019t know how many men the original owner had seduced. Before she thought that it was only He Run, and when she turned around and came to the door again, she felt that she was going to be bald.After hearing the news that Zhao Nanyu kicked Huai Jin away, she was more uneasy. She racked her brain to think how to deal with him for a while.First of all, she must not admit, but Song Luan didn\u2019t know how far Huia Jin and the original owner gone through, so she couldn\u2019t deny it completely.Song Luan\u2019s brain ached. Fortunately, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t come to settle accounts with her immediately, which also gave her a chance to breathe.In the dark night of early summer, when it was time for dinner, the sky in the distance was still bright, and the sunset was blossoming.Zhao Nanyu wrote two words in silence. Then he took his son\u2019s hand and went with him to Song Luan\u2019s residence for dinner.Song Luan was still in a state of confusion, and as she looked at Zhao Nanyu anxiously, she discovered that his face was not different from that of the usual times. She couldn\u2019t help asking herself, did he tolerate this matter? didn\u2019t plan to investigate?Zhao Nanyu smiled from the corner of his eyes and said softly, \u201cWhy do you keep looking at me?\u201dSong Luan was confused, unable to understand his thought process. Why did his face show as if nothing happened?She said, \u201cListen\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu narrowed his eyes, smiled lightly, and then interrupted her, \u201cEat first. \u201dWhen both of them are full, he will have the strength to settle accounts.Song Luan\u2019s words were forced down her throat. She had the courage to show her cards to him and explain to him, but Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to want to mention it.She picked the chopsticks and looked at her favorite dishes on the table without any appetite.Zhao Nanyu put some vegetables in her bowl, for fear that she would not eat, \u201cEat more. \u201dSong Luan gradually calmed down her heart and sighed, \u201cThank you.\u201dSince he didn\u2019t mention it, she didn\u2019t need to bother him.Zhao Nanyu seldom stayed in her house at night. Song Luan had just wiped her hair and had a faint fragrance on her body. She wore a very thin clothes, and her summer middle robe was transparent. He could see her exquisite body clearly.Under the moonlight, she seemed to be white and shining. Her long white neck made people want to bite on it.She didn\u2019t notice the person behind her. Facing the bed board, she supported her head with one hand and turned the book with her other hand.Song Luan disliked the heat so her loose trouser were half rolled, showing her white leg. Her feet curled up, it looked small and lovely.Zhao Nanyu quietly appeared behind her, enveloped her with his shadow. After a while, he suddenly reached out to hold her wrist and lifted the woman to him.Song Luan opened her eyes wide and looked at him foolishly. At this time, they were close to each other. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s breath was on her neck, causing her goose bumps to come out.The faces of the two people were almost sticking together. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s dark eyes stared at her closely, slowly opening her mouth. He seemed very happy. \u201cI came back in the afternoon and met a very interesting man in front of my residence. \u201dSong Luan shrank to the corner of the bed, and she knew that Zhao Nanyu would not easily spare her. She reluctantly smiled, \u201cI heard that. \u201dZhao Nanyu raised her eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you still don\u2019t know about it. It seems that the interesting man has an unusual relationship with you. \u201dSong Luan\u2019s back began to sweat. She kept her mind steady and said slowly, \u201cI have nothing to do with him.\u201dShe also knew how powerless and pale her explanation was, but Song Luan believed that the original owner and Huai Jin had never done anything out of the ordinary, and the woman\u2019s intuition had never been wrong.Song Luan felt that the man\u2019s expression in front of her seems gloomed, and his pleasant expression became somewhat distorted. He slightly pulled at his lips, \u201cNothing to do with him? That\u2019s not what I know.\u201dSong Luan prefered a one-hit-one-kill than being tormented slowly to death. She closed her eyes, suddenly waved away his hand, wrapped the quilt, and quickly rolled to the corner. She moved far away from him, and said, \u201cI said no. I am not that terrible. Although I have done many wrong things, I will never recognize what I haven\u2019t done. Belive it or not!\u201dSong Luan was very clever. After she had finished going wild, she began to sell miseries again. Her eyes were red. She was pitiful. She felt wronged. \u201cI have a bad reputation! But do I want to?! No matter what I do, it\u2019s always wrong, or it\u2019s fake. You don\u2019t believe me. You bully me, and don\u2019t you like me at all!\u201dWhen she said this, she was very aggrieved. She was the kind of righteous wronged. Song Luan also knew that she had said enough\u2026Shameful, but her shame was not important to her at all.Zhao Nanyu leaned close to her. He pushed her down and looked at her trembling. \u201cAre you wronged?\u201dThe woman under him was as pale as paper, and her body was slightly trembling. She was still very scared.Song Luan was frightened to tears while she gritted her teeth. She reached out to wipe off the tears and inhaled, \u201cAm I not wronged?\u201d!? If you doubt me\u2026you just\u2026.ah!\u201dA short scream suddenly came out of her throat. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes suddenly turned sharp. His dark pupils flashed darkly. He grabbed her chin, and whispered her name, \u201cSong Luan.\u201dThe person in his arms froze. She wanted to say something like \u201cif you doubt me, just let me go.\u201dSince she was not happy to live with him, anyway.Whoever likes someone as fierce and dark as him is stupid!Zhao Nanyu forced her to raise her neck. There were two tears on her delicate face. He lowered his head, covered her cheek gently with his cool lips, and lightly sucked the tears for her. Song Luan dared not move, and just let him do whatever he wanted.Zhao Nanyu raised his face, clearly his eyes at this time were as gentle as the water, but Song Luan still did not dare to look at him, let alone look at him directly.He pinched the finger on her chin lightly because of this, she had to meet his eyes, but only to hear Zhao Nanyu say, \u201cSong Luan, I don\u2019t care how many men you have in the past.\u201d\u201cFrom today on, you\u2019d better cut them off. \u201dHe chuckled softly, \u201cOtherwise, I will kill them one by one.\u201d\u201cKill them in front of you. \u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enjoy <3\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fTranslated by: TinkerSong Luan\u2019s eyes were red, while she swallowed, \u201cI know. \u201dZhao Nanyu nodded contentedly, loosened her chin, his fingertips gradually fell along her cheeks. He lowered his face to her neck and smelled the light fragrance that belonged to her.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart moved, his eyes deepened gradually, and his cold fingers rested on her waist. He untied the belt of her clothes. Song Luan was frightened. She trembled and was nervous.Then, overwhelming kisses fell on her, and she heard him say, \u201cAs long as you are obedient, I will treat you well. \u201dShe\u2019s his wife. If she keeps her peace and breaks up with other men, he will be good and not hurt her.Zhao Nanyu was not bored of her delicate and daring resistance. He even felt an unusual pleasure in his heart.This weak and fragile thing can only depend on him. He could manipulate her sadness and joy. This greatly satisfied his desire for control. He also liked the claws that she occasionally showed. She was cute and arrogant.Song Luan thought that something would happen tonight, but Zhao Nanyu stopped at the last step, tied the buttons for her, and whispered in her ear, \u201cGo to sleep. \u201dSong Luan closed her eyes but couldn\u2019t sleep at all. She remembered that Zhao Nanyu, the male lead, had a great characteristic \u2013 his obsession to cleanliness.In novels centered for women, It was not a bad trait for a domineering male lead to have a habit of cleanliness. It was even considered a good quality because it would mean he won\u2019t casually like a woman, or won\u2019t easily have relations with them.\u00a0While she was relieved, she was still somewhat lost. Song Luan secretly pinched her thigh. What\u2019s the loss!?After Zhao Nanyu\u2019s warning, both him and his wife were in a peace for a long time.Another month later, Song Luan was shocked to find that a very important plot of the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019 was about to come, that is, the appearance of the female lead.The female lead of \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019 was a little flower tailor-made for the male lead. She only knew the simple and good things of the world. She had almost all the beauitful qualities of a woman. After saving the seriously injured male lead on the way, it was not a surprise that the male lead took an interest to her. As time went by, this interest became an infatuation.Since then, the male lead had killed all hindrances around her. The only ability that the female lead had was acting coquettish!And the male lead was very fond of looking at a beautiful woman who acts coquettishly, so he doted on her throughout the whole book.Angry, really angry.The gap between her and the female lead was big. This female lead had the right to do everything. In contrast, she had to carry all the blame that the original owner left.This fate is extremely tragic.The male lead took care of everything for the female lead clearly, and later, he placed people who was his confidants to serve beside the female lead in Zhao\u2019s house.When she was reading the book, Song Luan felt that the female lead seemed to be very happy. She didn\u2019t have to do anything and no one contradicted her. She stayed happily in the backyard all day and was spoiled to the bone.But this kind of life didn\u2019t seem to be free. She was secretly watched by people whenever she went out. It\u2019s bad that even though she had a good life, she was still being controlled.However, this matter had nothing to do with Song Luan. She thought about it and maybe after eliminating Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hatred value towards her, she had to talk to him well about the divorce. Anyway, her mother was not short of money. It didn\u2019t matter if she was abandoned. It was enough to be able to eat. And from the beginning, her goal was to escape.As long as the female lead appears, she could slip away!Ah so beautiful!The only thing that bothered her was that at present, it seemed that Zhao Nanyu still had no intention to separate from her. He really exerted his domineering nature to the fullest.Life is my own, and death could only die by my side.I\u2019m scared.Song Luan finished her breakfast and went to the front yard. Although her husband was a dog man, her son was still very good. He had won her heart.Zhao Chao was teaching little Zhao to read poems these days. Song Luan stood outside the door and waited for him for a long time before he finished. Zhao Chao came out.\u00a0His temperament was like a spring breeze. He smiles to everyone. It unconsciously made people relax and lower their guard against him.When he saw that Song Luan was dumbfounded, he immediately laughed and said: \u201cOh second sister-in-law is here. Little Zhao is still inside.\u201d\u201cWell, I came to see him.\u201dZhao Chao was still standing at the door without hesitation to move. It seemed that he wanted to stop her from entering. He was still uneasy. She had made all the scars on her son\u2019s body. Who knows whether she really repented? She might be pretending all this time. Thinking of this, the smile on the corner of his eyes became cold, and he said, \u201cHow can sister-in-law have the time?\u201dSong Luan laughed but her eyes were not smiling. \u201cI\u2019m free every day.\u201dZhao Chao looked at her face carefully, and suddenly made way, \u201cThen I will not disturb second sister-in-law. \u201dSong Luan frowned, and thought Zhao Chao had a subtle attitude towards her. He smiles at her even though he hates her. This attitude was better than others.She shook her head and didn\u2019t continue to think about it. She pushed open the door and went into the study. Little Zhao sat at a low table, looking at the book in front of him with a serious face, as if he was having a hard time.Song Luan sat down beside him, glanced at him, and said, \u201cDo you understand?\u201dLittle Zhao answered truthfully, \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201dSong Luan felt that the ancient poems Zhao Chao taught him were too difficult. Why would he put a four-year-old on such heavy burden? She closed his books gently. \u201cIf you can\u2019t understand them, just don\u2019t read it.\u201dLittle Zhao looked at the book in her hand and shook his head seriously. \u201cNo, my father will check it when he comes back in the evening. \u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d She frowned, \u201cWill you be punished if you can\u2019t answer? \u201dHe nodded, \u201cYes. \u201dSong Luan then asked, \u201cWhat will be the punishment?\u201cCopy the book.\u201dSong Luan was very angry, and was filled with indignation. She hugged her son, \u201cLet\u2019s not read it today. I will not let your father punish you in the evening.\u201dWhy so strict to a four-year-old child? When she was only four years old, she was just enjoying her childhood. She couldn\u2019t bear seeing her son be this way.He didn\u2019t say that he wanted to read the book and learn. It was because no one at home wanted to play with him. Children of the same age in the residence didn\u2019t like him and avoided him. He didn\u2019t like those people either.It was better to sit quietly in the room and read.But seeing that his mother didn\u2019t like him reading the book, he closed his mouth and didn\u2019t speak.Song Luan was afraid of the child being bored, so she got a paper and a pen. She used her painting skills to draw a map of the game of the Monopoly game, and then made the dice.The mother and the son sat cross-legged by the window, with the golden light slanting down her head.Song Luan simply told him the rules, and then they started the first game.He soon understood how to play. It seemed that the kid\u2019s luck was better. In the end, he won the game. He raised his face and smiled brightly at Song Luan.Song Luan squeezed little Zhao\u2019s face in a good mood and waved her big hand, \u201cLet\u2019s play again!\u201dAlthough he thought the board was dull, he closed his mouth since his mother was having a good time.Near noon, the Zhao family suddenly became busy.The sound of gongs in the street went through the courtyard and into Song Luan\u2019s ears. She asked her servant girl curiously, \u201cWhat day is today?\u201dGongs and drums were loud and firecrackers were blaring. It\u2019s not like there was a family event today.The servant girl replied, \u201cThe exam results will be unveiled today.\u201dSong Luan suddenly realized that it was the imperial examination. It was hot and noisy outside, but there was nothing in the house. It\u2019s quiet and weird.It was only in the afternoon that she heard that Zhao Wenyan was not in the list. Upon seeing the results, he didn\u2019t eat or drink, and was constantly depressed.Song Luan knew that he won\u2019t make it this time. It was only the next examination did he pass.After a few days, Song Luan accidentally often met third lady Zhao. The woman\u2019s face was haggard, pale, and her eyes were red. She must have cried several times. The sadness on her face made people feel worried.When she asked her, she realized that Zhao Wenyan had not yet recovered from failing the exam. Although he was willing to eat, he still didn\u2019t talk to people.Zhao Wenyan was spoiled since he was a child. He was talented and proud. The results made it hard for him to accept.When Song Luan saw him at the edge of pond\u2026 she subconsciously wanted to avoid him.He seemed to have grown taller. He looked pale and white as a paper. When he turned around, he was met with Song Luan\u2019s eyes. Song Luan discovered that he was lifeless. Since the pride he was once had was crushed, he had no will to continue living.She sighed. She didn\u2019t want to say anything, but she couldn\u2019t do nothing when she thought that only Zhao Wenyan was willing to die for her.Since she could not turn a blind eye, she walked slowly and greeted him.Zhao Wenyan stared at her angrily. Hearing this woman call his name made him think that she came to laugh at him.Song Luan held her hand around her and looked up at him. \u201cI heard that you were not on the list?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dNone of the family dared to mention it in front of him. She said it so lightly, and just wanted to humiliate him.Zhao Wenyan was even more aggrieved. The woman\u2019s heart did change easily. She once said she liked him, but now she treated him as ice.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Am I not telling the truth? I also heard that you want to commit suicide by not eating?\u201d She walked slowly to the pond without any mercy, and lightly reached for him, \u201cOh, why bother? If you really want to die, you can jump down here. It\u2019s faster than going on a hunger strike. \u201dSong luan didn\u2019t give him a chance to talk, and continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your second brother and your eldest brother will be filial to your parents. You can go at ease.\u201dZhao Wenyan\u2019s face was red with anger. He couldn\u2019t stand it. He roared angrily, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!!\u201dHe just felt ashamed. His second brother passed the exam at first take. Unlike him\u2026Song Luan glanced at him and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, why do you act like one? The worries your mother had made her thin. It\u2019s better for you to read more books these days. You\u2019re only 16 years old and your days are long. You\u2019re like a woman. Who wouldn\u2019t wan to laugh at you?\u201dEven though her intention was to comfort him, her words was unpleasant to hear.Zhao Wenyan gradually calmed down. Although the woman in front didn\u2019t seem to laugh at him, he still didn\u2019t want to show weakness in front of her. \u201cTake care of your own matters!\u201dHe stood up and went away. Then he turned around, said in a bad voice, \u201cWho told you to take care of me! Take care of yourself and don\u2019t talk with other men in the future! Otherwise my second brother won\u2019t let you go! Hum! That\u2019s all I have to say!\u201dHe was kind enough to remind her how annoying she was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In her eyes, Zhao Wenyan was still a child, and he could not help being arrogant. It would be better if he vented by being attacked. It would only make him feel comfortable in this way.The wind in the early summer was very gentle. The cool wind blew on her cheek. The fine hair on her forehead swayed with the wind. Her clothes were fluttering. The golden light fell at dusk, and she stayed for a while at the pond before going back to her residence.The house was ablazed with candlelight, and the servant girls with plates of vegetables came in and out.Zhao Nanyu had come back from Dali temple. He took off the imperial uniform and changed into a light blue regular suit. After bathing, his whole face looked more delicate, his eyebrows and eyes were clean, his skin was white, his temperament was cool, and he was like a fairy that could not be defiled.Song Luan found that the jade pendant hanging on his waist had never been changed, and it was still the old piece of jade that was not very eye-catching.She remembered that this should be a relic left by Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mother. His mother died of a serious illness. An abandoned prostitute with a year-old son was left in poverty. She finally died because they couldn\u2019t afford any medicine.\u00a0Everything his mother could sell was sold, but Zhao Nanyu was left with this piece of jade which was not very valuable.In this way, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s childhood was also miserable, and it\u2019s no wonder that when he grew up, his character was sick and twisted.Song Luan silently took back her eyes and sat down in the position opposite to him.Zhao Nanyu had a light fragrance on his body, which lingered on the tip of her nose. It smelled good, but she felt uncomfortable. Her chest was stuffy and her throat hurts.After coughing twice, she filled a large glass of water.\u201cUncomfortable? \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dSong Luan remembered that she had something else to say to him.The blood relationship was wonderful. Even though she didn\u2019t have the memory of having a baby in October, she knew her son instinctively. She opened her mouth and suddenly stopped. Because she hadn\u2019t figured out how to call him, It seemed that it was not polite to call him by his full name, and she felt uncomfortable calling him \u2018Ah Yu\u2019 like others.\u201cWell, I have to say something to you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI think you are too strict with your son. He is only four years old and doesn\u2019t need to learn too hard. There\u2019s an idiom that you should know\u2013\u2018It\u2019s not good to help draw the seedlings\u2019.\u201d<blockquote>Means that seedlings should naturally grow according to the time of nature. Forcing it to grow is not good.</blockquote>Zhao Nanyu smiled angrily. \u201cStrict? What happened to him?\u201dSong Luan tried to reason with him, \u201cThe ancient poetry and prose that you want him to learn are not understandable to a four-year-old child at all. If he doesn\u2019t understand it, you punish him. Don\u2019t you feel sorry?\u201dNever did Zhao Nanyu expect to be questioned one day by Song Luan that he didn\u2019t care enough for his children, so he was angry, \u201cAlthough the mother has many faults, you don\u2019t want him to be a useless waste in the future. \u201d\u201cBeing strict is not a bad thing, but you are in a hurry.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d Zhao Nanyu asked for her opinion seriously.After thinking about it, Song Luan said, \u201cWork and rest should be combined. You should still let him play. Don\u2019t punish him everytime, okay?\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan was nervous and her palm was sweating profiously. Fortunately, Zhao Nanyu was not so unreasonable. He could also reasonably listen to her suggestions.On second thought, if their relationship becomes better in the future, she could put the facts to reason with him, which should not be as difficult as it was now.She couldn\u2019t help but want to say two words: Very Good!Song Luan was in a good mood and ate more than one bowl of rice. Maybe she ate too much because the uncomfortable feeling came back.While getting up, she was dizzy and out of breath. It immediately became dark in front of her. She couldn\u2019t stop her movement of falling.Thanks to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s quick eyes, he stretched out his hand to her waist. His face was heavy and his black and white eyes were clear. He wanted to speak. Song Luan waved his hand. She first took a step and laughed dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s because I got up so quickly that I wasn\u2019t able to stand still.\u201dAfter she stood firmly, she pushed his hand away silently. Song Luan didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her just now. The uncomfortable feeling was only for a moment, so she didn\u2019t pay attention to it after.This body was empty originally, so it was not surprising that she fainted today.Zhao Nanyu pinched her wrist and dragged her to the side. Her eyes were bright. He looked at her carefully and saw nothing wrong before releasing her. \u201cIf you are not comfortable, you have to say it. Don\u2019t bear it.\u201dSong Luan thought to herself. Even if I have a minor illness or disaster, I dare not let you know. You want to poison me!\u201cI\u2019m not a person who can endure.\u201d Her answer was so natural.Zhao Nanyu whispered softly, \u201cThat\u2019s good. \u201dWhat\u2019s good? Song Luan didn\u2019t understand.That night, she thought Zhao Nanyu would tell her about the matter of him leaving the capital, but he didn\u2019t. Song Luan laid straight on the bed for the night, and didn\u2019t bother to wait.She didn\u2019t interfere with the main plot of the book. The plot line must not have changed, then the rest maybe Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t plan to tell her.All right. If you don\u2019t want to say it, don\u2019t say it.Anyway, if he was about to leave, just hurry up and leave.\u00a0Go meet your lovely, kind, and simple female lead, and then let me go.The next day, Zhao Nanyu stayed at home.The people in the residence who believed that their feelings have improved gradually changed their minds. In a few months, they could see clearly whether Song Luan really changed or not.Zhao Nanyu spent most of the day away from her residence, either in Dali temple or in his study.After taking care of Zhao Wenyan\u2019s affairs, third lady Zhao looked much better, and now she repeatedly reminded her to have children.\u00a0Every night there was a vigil outside the house, so when Song Luan and Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t spend much time in a room together, third lady Zhao naturally knew about it.She didn\u2019t think it\u2019s Zhao Nanyu\u2019s problem. It must be Song Luan who refused to let him touch her. They were so indifferent in the room.At the end of this month\u2019s family banquet, third lady Zhao secretly pulled Song Luan over to talk to her, \u201cAh Luan, you should be more considerate of Ah Yu. He really can\u2019t hold back his vigorous age. Moreover, you have been cold to him, which will chill his heart.\u201dWhat third lady Zhao didn\u2019t say was that when the time comes that Ah Yu couldn\u2019t hold back and would find a concubine, Song Luan should not make trouble at that time.Song Luan was really wronged. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want to touch her, what could she do? Should she take off her clothes and rush to him? force him?\u201cMother, I know it.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dThird lady Zhao didn\u2019t believe her. Song Luan felt that their relationship was so good now. If she had to have a relationship with Zhao Nanyu, she would have to sleep beside him as a woman. Who knew if she she could bear Zhao Nanyu\u2019s appearance on the bed.That man naturally have very good abilities. She didn\u2019t want to die or be paralyzed in bed. If she could, she didn\u2019t want to do this.Song Luan forgot what third lady Zhao said in two days. In addition, Zhao Nanyu had to leave the capital in a few days. She had a lot of ambition and became more courageous.Looking for a good day, Song Luan came out the door wearing beautiful clothes. She was stupid to think that there was no one following behind her. She was free and unrestrained as she walked.Song Heqing didn\u2019t expect to bump into his most disobedient sister in the restaurant.Song Heqing and Song Luan were born to one mother, but was still kind to his other sisters.The only thing that worried him was Song Luan.He looked back at his sister on the lounge. His brain was dull, and he rubbed his eyebrows and told his servant \u201cGo down and invite the third lady up. \u201d\u201cYes. \u201dSong Luan was confuse after being taken to Song Heqing. She saw the man in front of him shouted, \u201cBrother\u201d.They met on the day they returned, so Song Luan recognized him.Song Heqing sighed, \u201cYou\u2026 I..I don\u2019t know what to say about you. It\u2019s only been few months since there was peace. To be honest, have you come out to find a man again today?\u201dSong Luan shook her head fiercely. \u201cNo, I came here to buy some rouge water powder and silk.\u201dSong Heqing was dubious. Since his sister married, he had met her ten times outside. And those ten times, she always had a different man with her!\u201cIs it?\u201d He waved impatiently, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about today\u2026 I heard that the slave you raised made trouble at the gate of Zhao residence a month ago! What are you doing?! Zhao Nanyu is not ugly, why can\u2019t you see it?! I don\u2019t ask you to die for him, but can\u2019t you give him face?\u201dThere were not that many wild men in the capital, but there was no one as unabashed as her! Everyone in the capital knew.Song Luan was bombarded by her brother. She felt wronged. She slapped the table, \u201cHe won\u2019t touch me. You are my brother. How can you blame me? I still feel angry!\u201dSong Heqing paled. He lowered his voice, and gnashed his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can\u2019t think of a way to let him touch you!\u201dHis sister should be very good at it.Song Luan\u2019s eyes widened. Wow, the Song family was something. Was her brother suggesting that she should give Zhao Nanyu an aphrodisiac?Song Heqing waved to his entourage behind him and said two words in his ear. The entourage quickly left the room and came back soon. The man arrived with just a small bag with the medicine inside. Song Heqing lost all his face and put the medicine from his hand to her. \u201cTake it. It\u2019s easy to use. If it\u2019s still doesn\u2019t work, I won\u2019t you stop from finding a wild man. Keep a low profile and don\u2019t go public.\u201dSong Luan was stunned. At last, she knew why the original owner turned out like this. It was all because she was spoiled by the Song family.The medicine in her hand was like a hot potato. Give this medicine to Zhao Nanyu? Was her brother crazy or was she stupid?She dare not.She was afraid Zhao Nanyu would eat her raw.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He gave Song Luan a lot of money before he left.Song Luan went downstairs after she had eaten and drunk enough in the private room. She bought a lot of things in the street at one breath. When her mood became better, she was reluctant to go back to the residence.When she arrived home, she watched Zhao Nanyu standing under the bridge from afar. He stood quietly with his hands on his back, as if waiting for her. The man smiled at her gently and said, \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d After a pause, she said, \u201cI also bought you a present. \u201dZhao Nanyu was stunned for a moment, but didn\u2019t expect that he had his share in the things she bought today. He had a deep smile in the corner of his eyes, and politely thanked her.Song Luan intentionally bought him a jade crown. Anyway, it\u2019s not wrong to be nice to the male lead. In fact, she didn\u2019t only buy things for him alone, but also for her son, and even Zhao Chao, he was after all the teacher of little Zhao. Although they didn\u2019t like each other very much, they didn\u2019t treat each other badly.Zhao Nanyu raised his step and walked towards her, and now stood a closer distance. His tall body blocked her light and Song Luan\u2019s hair fluttered in the wind. He raised his hand and brushed her hair carefully, and said warmly, \u201cI will go to Quzhou the day after tomorrow.\u201dSong Luan was relieved. It seemed that the plot hadn\u2019t changed much because of her transmigrating. She was happy in her heart, and wanted him to go out quickly.Go find your female lead, your little white flower is waiting for you!Song Luan tried to hide her happiness and showed an indiffirent reaction, \u201cOh, good.\u201dShe raised her eyelids and looked at Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face quietly, and found that the man seemed not very happy.After several months of getting along, Song Luan got a skill to accurately see Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mood. Although the smile on his face did not falter, she could see the falseness revealed in his smile.Gee.. a man\u2019s heart is truly a needle on the bottom of the sea.She didn\u2019t understand why he was unhappy again? She had only said two words since she came back.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were always on her face, looking at her expression carefully. Unfortunately, he can\u2019t see any disappointment or worry from her face. The arc of his lips gradually fell down, and his smiled dropped by three points. At the moment, it was very clear that Song Luan didn\u2019t care about his journey.This perception made Zhao Nanyu feel uncomfortable. His eyes darkened, and the sharp edge on his eyes was hidden. His five fingers under his sleeve slightly curled up into fist. He wanted her to go to Quzhou together.Going from and to Quzhou would take about half a month. It didn\u2019t take long, but this time, Zhao Nanyu wanted to take her.\u00a0Song Luan\u2019s heart thumped when she saw his eyes darkened. She was about to talk, but the man in front of her turned and entered the room, as if he didn\u2019t want to care any longer.The two people remained silent in the room, and no one took the initiative to open their mouth. Zhao Nanyu sat in front of the window with a book in his hand. The lines of his chin were tight, his beautiful features were a little sharp, and his whole body was cold as ice.Song Luan sat far away from him, cross legged on the soft coach. She took all the things she had just bought, and subdivided them.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s remaining light silently watched her movements, his thin lips pursed into a straight line, and his expression gradually became cold.She was really heartless.Song Luan gave full play to the word \u201cextravagance\u201d when she went out this time. Aunt Lin gave her a lot of money when she went back to her mother\u2019s house. In addition, Song Heqing gave her a piece of silver, so she didn\u2019t lack money at all. She bought everything she liked.She put the jewelry and clothes she bought for herself in the cabinet. She found the jade crown that she wanted to give to Zhao Nanyu, and held it in the palm of her hand for a long time with hesitation. She pulled back and forth her thoughts whether she would give or not.Song Luan\u2019s eyes peeped at him, and found Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was quite cold, which seemed even more unhappy than before. The air pressure in the bedroom was very low. She sighed and chose to continue sitting until Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face looked better.She picked up a book casually from the bookshelf. The content on it was complicated and lengthy, so after reading it for a while, her little head couldn\u2019t control it and fell asleep.Zhao Nanyu put down the book in his hand and silently took her actions into his eyes. The frost and snow between his eyebrows gradually melted. His face was not as heavy as before.He remembered that Song Luan couldn\u2019t even read a few words. He also heard that when she was a child, she refused to study hard. Her studies were in a mess. She often made her teacher angry to the point that the teacher wanted to die.They were married for four years, and he had never seen her read books before. Sure enough, she just pretended to read and had slept right after reading two pages.Ater a moment, Song Luan\u2019s forehead knocked on the table. The pain woke her up. She rubbed her forehead, and subconsciously looked over Zhao Nanyu\u2019s side. The man looked down as if he didn\u2019t see the movement on her side.Song Luan got down from the couch, grabbed the jade crown she bought, and walked to him. She coughed twice and refused to say more, \u201cThe jade crown I bought for you.\u201dZhao Nanyu took the thing and looked down, \u201cIt\u2019s very nice.\u201dSong Luan thought that his face looked a little better after he got the gift from her. It was much better than the gloomy look. She nodded, \u201cYou like it.\u201dZhao Nanyu quietly took the jade crown. He looked up, thought for a moment, and said, \u201cI have something to discuss with you. \u201dZhao Nanyu thought that he might not be able to wait for Song Luan to bring up the matter of Quzhou. She didn\u2019t care from beginning to end, and didn\u2019t even ask when he would come back. Just now, she treated his anger like a joke.Also, why bother with her so much. Zhao Nanyu decided to tell her.Song Luan thought it was a trivial matter so she didn\u2019t care about what he\u2019s going to say, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dZhao Nanyu looked at her calmy: \u201cYou will go to Quzhou with me the next morning.\u201dHe said it was a discussion, but the tone of it was as if the decision was final.Song Luan was dumbfounded for a long time. What\u2019s the matter with him? No, she refuse!If the plot won\u2019t change, that means, the male lead would be ambushed on the way to Quzhou. He was seriously injured and got saved by the female lead.What was she going to do? What if she died in the hands of an assassin! Besides, she didn\u2019t like to stay with Zhao Nanyu.Song Luan wanted to shake her head, but she didn\u2019t dare to refuse in front of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes. She said politely, \u201cI haven\u2019t been far away. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll drag you behind, and will delay your business.\u201dAs she talked longer, her voice gradually became lower. Zhao Nanyu looked at her with a smile. This made her hair stood up.Song Luan gnawed her teeth and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s more. If we are not home, who would take care of little Zhao?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s heart kept falling, and his eyebrows and eyes seemed to be covered with frost and snow. His expression became colder and colder.However, the smile on the corner of his eyes and the tip of his eyebrows became deeper and deeper, which made him very penetrating.He reached out his hand and touched her brow and asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201dWithout waiting for her answer, Zhao Nanyu raised her chin slightly and said forcefully, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to, you must still go.\u201dHe also kindly reminded her to pack up her luggage in advance.Song Luan couldn\u2019t resist, and nodded with clenched teeth, \u201cWell, then.\u201dIt took a long time for her to walk to the cabinet. She was about to prepapre all the clothes she had to wear, when her heart suddenly hurt.The pain came suddenly and violently. Her white fingers tightly clasped the door of the cabinet.\u00a0Song Luan\u2019s face was as white as paper, and her whole body was weak. Her throat hurt like a knife when she breathed.She opened her mouth and wanted to call Zhao Nanyu\u2019s name. Before she could make a sound, her eyes gradually went black and she fainted.She seemingly saw the man that was not far away from her changed his facial expression before striding towards her in a rush.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the dream, she was a spectator outside the scenes. In the dream, there was a woman who often wore gorgeous and bright red clothes. Her face was extremely beautiful, her character was domineering, but her words were sharp and bitter.The plots written in the book all happened. Her son broke his leg, and the silent child relied on crutches from then on. In the dream, she and Zhao Nanyu were almost strangers. She taunted and insulted him.Zhao Nanyu was as cold as a stone. The violence between his eyebrows was thousands of times as strong as it was now. His eyes were bright and dark, and there was a fierce sense of killing aura in his heart. As the days passed, her situation became more and more sad. First, the Song family crumbled and Song Luan fell ill.She couldn\u2019t even get up from the bed. There was a strong smell of medicine in the room, which couldn\u2019t be dispelled even by opening the window. She was lying on the bed with thin bones, pale face, and there was almost no blood on her lips. As if she would die the next seconds.Her internal organs felt like it was being eaten, or being stirred inside with a knife, and even breathing became torture. She would like to die at once. It was not good if she was filled with medicine. She slept with pain every day.Song Luan looked at the woman lying on the bed, whose eyes were sad and her heart was as dead as ashes, and inexplicably began to shed tears. She felt very sad in her dream.The woman\u2019s bleak eyes seemed to look at her, and a smile appeared on her beautiful pale face. Song Luan thought that the woman saw her.Suddenly, the man in dark blue came in slowly. The sound of boots coming nearer sounded like the bell of death.The poor thin woman on the bed pulled up a hard smile, \u201cHere you are.\u201d\\n The man looked down at her for a long time, then sighed with sympathy, \u201cUh, so pathetic.\u201dThe woman felt pain. The pain in her chest had never stopped. She seemed to live in a hell of endless pain. She opened her mouth and said weakly, \u201cKill me.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked at her calmly as she asked for him to kill her. He smiled and asked, \u201cDoes it hurt? \u201dHow could it not hurt?Every day, her limbs and her inner organs seem to be stabbed over and over by a knife. The pain was felt from the bottom of the foot to the back of the head. There was no place on her whole body that it didn\u2019t hurt. She had been suffering for three years.\u201cZhao Nanyu, you are a bastard\u2019s child. Being born under a prositute woman, you can\u2019t escape the fact that you\u2019re born of sin.\u201d After she said this, she began to gasp heavily to relieve the pain in her chest.The man smiled instead of anger.As she wished, he had an exquisitely crafted dagger in his hand.He helped her up, and the sharp point of the dagger pointed straight at her heart. With a sharp look in his eyes, Zhao Nanyu stabbed the dagger into her heart without hesitation. \u201cGo die.\u201dSong Luan woke up and was so scared that she hadn\u2019t recovered from her eyes for a long time. Just now, the dream seemed too real. She even suspected that the scene was when the original owner died.Song Luan\u2019s eyes were staring at the top of the bed, the back of her head was numb, and her heart was blank.She took a deep breath and gradually recovered from the fear in her dream. She slowly sat up, leaned on the pillow and remembered that she had just fainted.Her hand unconsciously touched her heart. At this time, she didn\u2019t feel any pain or even any discomfort. But Song Luan still couldn\u2019t forget the sudden pain in her heart before fainting, like being stabbed with a needle in the softest part of her heart.Song Luan\u2019s face was rather dignified. She knew that the male lead in the original book had given the original owner a slow-poison medicine. It seemed that the dog man poisoned her earlier than she thought.Thinking of this, Song Luan\u2019s mind was bursting with thoughts of blood. She wanted to curse, but she swallowed her courage to scold the male lead. Isn\u2019t it just to survive?! She was so angry that she turned red around her eyes.The residence\u2026 There was no one in the room. Song Luan wanted to share blood with Zhao Nanyu.She forced herself to calm down. She thought about it. She would go out to see a doctor tomorrow. This body would still survive.On second thought, if Zhao Nanyu had the poison, he should have the antidote in his hand. It would be impossible unless she coaxed him, would he give the antidote to her?***Zhao Chao was confused when Zhao Nanyu visited him. He didn\u2019t know what happened until he saw the woman lying unconscious in the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with second sister-in-law?\u201dZhao Nanyu said in a hoarse voice, \u201cLook after her.\u201dFor the first time, Zhao Chao saw that his second brother was nervous, and the cause was this woman named Song Luan, whom his second brother always hated. His heart sank, \u201cSecond brother\u2026.you will not \u201dZhao Nanyu snapped at him, staring straight at him with black eyes. He was furious. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, hurry up. \u201dZhao Chao did not dare to delay any more. He sat down and began to feel the pulse for Song Luan, frowning slightly. Song Luan\u2019s pulse was normal. \u201cShe is fine.\u201dZhao Nanyu, with a black face, hardly looked away from her. He didn\u2019t believe Zhao Chao. He said in a cold voice, \u201cShe just suddenly fainted. She couldn\u2019t stand straight and couldn\u2019t speak. And you told me she\u2019s fine now? Hmm?\u201dHe had to admit that the moment when Song Luan suddenly fell in front of him, his heart became nervous, even scared.Since two years ago, Song Luan had been drinking porridge every morning with the poison he ordered. He only guessed that those medicine had worked, but he already stopped ordering from them a few months ago.Zhao Chao was full of innocence. \u201cSecond brother, I know what you are doubting, but there is no problem in her pulse. Tell me again, what did she look like when she fainted? \u201d\u201cShe covered her heart.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s palpitation.\u201dZhao Chao also had no choice. His medical skills were not bad. He learned from a famous family and was talented. He saved countless lives. There was no reason why he couldn\u2019t make a diagnosis and treatment on Song Luan.What\u2019s more, the second brother got the poison medicine from him. Symptoms such as heart pain didn\u2019t coincide with poisoning.\u201cDo you have any antidotes?\u201d Zhao Nanyu suddenly asked him.Zhao Chao put out his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s my master\u2019s medicine. I\u2019ll ask him when he travels back to capital.\u201d He also saw that his second brother\u2019s attitude towards Song Luan was different. After thinking about it, he said a few words of relief. \u201cSecond brother, you don\u2019t have to worry too much. The medicine is very strange. It won\u2019t work without the right amount in the next three or five years. \u201dAfter seeing off Zhao Chao, Zhao Nanyu stood under the corridor for a long time. He looked up and looked at the distance with quiet eyes. He didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.The cold wind fluttered his clothes. His fingers were cold. He heard the movement in the room. He turned and entered the room. Song Luan sat on the edge of the bed barefoot, her expression was silly, and her pale face was flushed red.He went over and crouched down in good temper to put on her shoes for her. Then he raised his face, his eyes were soft and watery, and looked at her quietly. He asked, \u201cIs there any discomfort? \u201dSong Luan shook her head. \u201cNo. \u201dIt\u2019s true. She felt good and there was no pain.Zhao Nanyu sighed, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Then he asked, \u201cWhat would you like to eat? \u201dSong Luan\u2019s stomach was really empty, so she felt hungry. She opened her eyes and looked at him brightly. \u201cI want to have porridge. \u201dShe simply felt that it was better for her health to eat light food.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s fingers in the air paused, his eyes drooped, his face was hard to distinguish, and after silence he said, \u201cI let the kitchen stew chicken soup for you to eat.\u201d\u201cThat will do.\u201d As long as it\u2019s light and nourishing, she could accept it. Zhao Nanyu got up and prepared to bring chicken soup. Song Luan reached out and grabbed his clothes. He looked back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? \u201dSong Luan tried to look calm while pretending to ask him casually, \u201cWhat happened to me just now? Did a doctor come?\u201dZhao Nanyu touched her face, a little fondly, \u201cYes, they said you\u2019re fine.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s expression almost faltered. She wanted to stretch out her hand and scratch his face. She didn\u2019t believe it!\u201cReally? I\u2019m\u2026 Healthy?\u201d She asked, gritting her teeth.\u201cWell, take it easy.\u201dIt was really hard for Song Luan to speak up and take it easy after being poisoned.She wanted to tear Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face, but the plot in her dream still left her with lingering fear. She didn\u2019t want to experience the feeling that she was in pain all the time and couldn\u2019t sleep.Song Luan got out of bed and drank a large bowl of chicken soup in front of Zhao Nanyu. She could eat, drink, and jump with no discomfort.Song Luan couldn\u2019t help but think that she might misunderstood Zhao Nanyu. Maybe this wasn\u2019t poison but just simple fainting?Song Luan was still not at ease. She put down her chopsticks and looked at Zhao Nanyu in her wet eyes. She called out to him, \u201cAh Yu..\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s body suddenly froze, his breath sank, his fingers trembled, and his eyes were dark.It\u2019s sweet.He wanted her to continue to call him \u2018Ah Yu\u2019 a hundred times more.Song Luan raised a sweet smile on the corner of her mouth. She opened her mouth and continued to say to him, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear. Let\u2019s go to Quzhou together. I want to stay with you and not leave you.\u201dOh, she\u2019s going to vomit herself.Song Luan also learned to be smart. In the past half month, he had a good relationship with Zhao Nanyu. It\u2019s not a bad thing for him to like her more.It\u2019s better for him to be able to put his three spirits and five principles into his mind, so he would definitely not want to kill her.Zhao Nanyu pulled her into her arms and touched the corner of her mouth with her soft lips. \u201cNo.\u201dZhao Nanyu changed his mind and couldn\u2019t let her follow him. He pinched her waist and bit her on the corner of her mouth. \u201cJust take good care of yourself at home.\u201dSong Luan really wanted to slap away the man who was close her. The dog man took advantage of her and wouldn\u2019t even let her get her wish.With Song Luan \u2018s understanding of him, she couldn\u2019t expect to cultivate a relationship of adversity with him on the way to Quzhou.Song Luan thought of the package of Huanhuan given by her brother. She completely decided to let it go, and planned to give it to him tomorrow night.If you can\u2019t get his heart, you have to get his body first.Let him be reluctant to kill her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enjoy <3 <3Glossary:Huanhuan \u2013 This is the name of the aphrodisiac that Song Luan\u2019s brother gave her.\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fTranslated by: TinkerSong Luan didn\u2019t sleep well all at night. She kept tossing and turning. In the middle of the night, she was still lying on the bed with her eyes open. She didn\u2019t dare to move. She was afraid to disturb the man on her side.Her mouth still hurts, there were still fine wounds on her lips that Zhao Nanyu just bit. Song Luan didn\u2019t like to curry favor with the male lead before she fainted. Even if she knew the final ending of the original owner, she just wanted to get along with him well, and didn\u2019t make any more mistakes. She never wanted to flatter and grovel in front of him.As the saying goes \u2013 when you lick a dog, you get nothing.But now the situation was grim, she had to seduce Zhao Nanyu. It\u2019s better to get his heart, so she didn\u2019t have to worry all day about being killed by him.Zhao Nanyu had a beautiful appearance, exquisite brows, and looked as elegant as painting. She had nothing to lose going to bed with him! But to be honest, Song Luan wanted to throw away the medicine her brother gave before. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t.When Zhao Nanyu touched and kissed her body last time, he could still control himself. He even closed her clothes and did nothing to her after.If she didn\u2019t use this medicine, and wait until Zhao Nanyu was willing to touch her, it would already be the year of the monkey!Song Luan thought about things and gradually fell asleep. In just a few hours, she had many fine dreams, and each fragments were presented in her mind. It\u2019s a pity that when she woke up, she forgot everything and didn\u2019t remember a single dream.It\u2019s rare that she woke up before it got dark. Zhao Nanyu stood in front of the bed, his back was facing her, and he was dressing his clothes. He slowly put up his clothes and when he turned around, he saw her sleepy eyes. The clothes on her shoulders slid down, and her skin was bright and white. Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t help it, but leaned over and kissed her. \u201cYou can sleep a little longer.\u201dSong Luan nodded. She was still sleepy. Both her eyes and brain hurt. It was the kind of pain that came from staying up all night. She rubbed her temples, and the tone of her voice was still lingering. \u201cOkay, I know. \u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t put the light on. The room wasn\u2019t very bright. He covered the quilt for her. Then he went to the outside room. Before he left, he ordered not to disturb her.Song Luan rolled two times on the bed, and rolled out of the bed in good clothes. Her belly was white. She sat in front of the dressing table and yawned. She drew a light make-up for herself. After finishing, she asked the servant girl to come in and fix her hair.Song Luan was still gorgeous, but her eyes looked less brighter.After dressing up, she couldn\u2019t wait and grabbed the money bag and went out. She strictly forbid the servant girls in the residence not to follow. Her fierce appearance was very intimidating and frightened the servants. Obviously, no one followed her. No one dared to ask where she was going or what she was going to do.Song Luan went to the street and inquired about the best medicine hall in the capital. She went to the rank of famous doctors to see them for herself. Many people come to see those famous doctors every day. Just after the door opened in the early morning, the front of the medicine hall was already full of people.She stood at the end of the line, praying silently for herself, hoping that she wasn\u2019t poisoned.Song Luan walked into the hospital with tension. The doctor asked her to sit down politely. She didn\u2019t know if she was too sensitive. She always felt that the doctor\u2019s eyes were different from those of others.She reached over and the doctor closed his eyes.After a while, the fingers on her pulse moved away slowly. Song Luan couldn\u2019t wait to ask, \u201cWhat is it like? What\u2019s wrong with me, doctor? \u201d\u201cThere is no abnormality in the lady\u2019s pulse. The body is just weak. Go back and take two doses of tonic.\u201dSong Luan was still uneasy, and stretched out her left hand again, \u201cOr would you like to see the pulse of this hand again? Traditional Chinese medicine pays attention to listening the pulse. Doctor, take a good look at me.\u201d She continued with a dignified look, \u201cMy heart and mouth ached yesterday, and my premonition was very bad. Doctor, please tell me the truth. \u201dThe doctor stroked his beard and said in silence, \u201cDid lady feel extreme pain before?\u201dSong Luan nodded.\u201cIs it still painful now? \u201dSong Luan also nodded.\u2026The doctor thought for a while and told her, \u201cLady has a poison in her body.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart and knees were cold. It\u2019s too late. This body was already poisoned.Wuwuwu! Zhao Nanyu lied to her last night!Seeing that her face was white, the doctor hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, lady. This time your palpitation is not caused by the poison. The reason why I didn\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s poisonous is because it\u2019s harmless. \u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cWhat does that mean? \u201d\u201cI can\u2019t diagnose what kind of poison it is at the moment, but the amount of this medicine in your body is not much, and it will take a certain time for the attack. As long as you don\u2019t continue to take it, there should be no problem in your body. \u201dSong Luan asked anxiously, \u201cDon\u2019t you know what kind of medicine it is? That is to say, you don\u2019t have an antidote?\u201dThe doctor nodded.Song Luan\u2019s fingers were colder than before. She felt a little sad and wanted to cry.Now it seems that there was no other way but to coax Zhao Nanyu to give her the antidote.Before the doctor had finished saying, \u201cAs for the sudden palpitation of the lady yesterday, maybe you haven\u2019t had a good rest recently. Pay more attention to your rest, and it will be fine.\u201dSong Luan gloomily said thanks to the doctor, and went out of the hospital with no idea after paying the doctor\u2019s fee.After she left, the doctor looked at his back and shook his head. He sighed to the children around him, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether this lady\u2019s life is good or not. \u201dBefore she came in to see the doctor, a young man had first let someone greet him and told him not to say what he shouldn\u2019t say. He guessed that what he had just said with the lady had been sent to the second young master of the Zhao family without a word.Song Luan was still surprised by the fact that she had been poisoned. She didn\u2019t hurt her son or scold Zhao Nanyu as a mean son of a prostitute this time. How could this person do it to her?After careful analysis, she came to think of the most important characteristics of being an overbearing young master. The possessive desire imposed a paranoid personality that couldn\u2019t tolerate his wife\u2019s indifference.He must be the only one who owns his woman\u2019s mind and body. He should be in charge of life and death. Emotions and joys. Just like the female lead, after marrying him, she only had a few days out in this life, and there were many people hiding behind, watching her every move.Song Luan shuddered at the thought, felt the chill throughout her body.This kind of life which only relies solely on Zhao Nanyu to live is terrible.After returning to the residence, Song Luan locked herself in her room the whole afternoon, and then gradually figured it out. Anyway, the doctor also said that the poison was not deep enough, as long as she didn\u2019t eat it anymore poison, she would be okay.Looking at the Hehuan in the drawer, she thought it was really a good thing. Maybe after tonight, Zhao Nanyu would fall in love with her and wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt her in the future.She really didn\u2019t want to die, and she didn\u2019t want to die in such pain.Song Luan asked people to prepare good wine. For the first time, she didn\u2019t have any experience in medication. She poured half a bag of Hehuan powder into the bottle with shaking hands. She felt her chin and thought that the dosage should be almost the same.This bottle of wine is not only for Zhao Nanyu, but also for herself. She\u2019s going to drink it. She\u2019s brave and doesn\u2019t give her way back. She raised her hand and shook the wine. Then she puts the tip of her nose together to make sure it\u2019s colorless and tasteless.Maybe it was because he was going to Quzhou the next day, Zhao Nanyu came back from Dali Temple very early that day, and came directly to her residence as soon as he came back.Zhao Nanyu felt that during these days, she only stayed by his side, even if she didn\u2019t say anything. He silently observed her every move and kept it in his mind. Without him knowing, she had already occupied a big part in his heart.Song Luan took the initiative to come over. She smiled at him sweetly. \u201cAh Yu.\u201dZhao Nanyu squeezed the brush in his hand and tightened his back. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard that there are many beautiful women in Quzhou. When you arrive, you won\u2019t like other girls, will you? \u201dZhao Nanyu looked up at her and said, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s smile was even sweeter. If she had a tail behind her, it would already be wagging. \u201cYou are so good!\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s heart moved. He couldn\u2019t help touch her face. She smiled at him in the sunshine. She looked so beautiful.After two people finished their dinner together, Song Luan summoned up her courage and suddenly stopped him, \u201cI want to drink. \u201dZhao Nanyu had seen her drunk state more than once. He frowned.Before he refused, Song Luan had put the glass on the table and poured two the wine in each glass quickly.Her palms were sweaty. She took the glass and handed it to him. \u201cWould you like to have a drink with me? \u201dZhao Nanyu took the glass and was stunned. Then he hooked up his lips and smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe raised his neck and poured the wine into his throat. The stone in Song Luan\u2019s heart landed steadily. She bit her teeth and poured her cup and into her stomach.Zhao Nanyu looked at her meaningfully and smiled deeply in the corner of his eyes. He couldn\u2019t see what was put in the glass. He just wanted to see what Song Luan wanted to do.The candlelight was shining on her bright white face, and soon the effect of the medicine began to play. Song Luan was weak. She could not stand on the table until her hands were leaning on the table. The bright red lips were bitten by her. Looking at the pale man in front of her, she swallowed her saliva and said stupidly, \u201cI\u2019m a little hot.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s black eyes were nailed to her face, and there was no reply.Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand it. The effect was too strong. Her brain was not clear.Song Luan was not aggrieved. She looked very pitiful. She sniffed and was about to cry. She tugged at his clothes, as if begging him, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cHelp me.\u201dZhao Nanyu grabbed her chin, and his cold fingers made Song Luan felt very comfortable. She unconsciously rubbed against his palm,He chuckled and sucked the tear from the corner of her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t cry now, you will cry later.\u201dThe woman in his arms trembled with fear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her face blushed red. She sympathized with the madam and was a little envious. The master didnt look like a person that could toss around vigorously. Sure enough, you can\u2019t judge a person by their appearance.Song Luan felt that she was going to die. She was not far away from her death. At last, she cried out shamlessly. She begged and cried out in tears. Gradually, Song Luan realised that whenever she begged him, Zhao Nanyu would become more and more active. The man bit her earlobe and smiled softly, as if laughing at her ignorance.She was a fish on a chopping board. She couldn\u2019t fight back.When the two people stopped in the middle of the night, Song Luan was too tired that she couldn\u2019t lift her hand. The feeling was like lifting a stone and smashing her foot. Although she felt exhausted to death, she couldn\u2019t bear to sleep. She opened her eyes laboriously. Zhao Nanyu pulled the quilt up on her body. He looked at her with warmth and gentleness. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sleep?\u201dSong Luan also wanted to sleep, but she couldn\u2019t. She asked, \u201cCan you take me with you to Quzhou?\u201d\u201cYou stay at home. \u201dSong Luan put the quilt over her head and covered her face. She was not very happy.Dog man still taking advantage of her.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was a little heavy. After he thought for a while, his face was still not very good. How could he not see just now that Song Luan did everything just so she could go to Quzhou. Even there was no love with those men she entangled with.There\u2019s no love.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart was uncomfortable. It was very painful.Song Luan\u2019s eyes were slightly red, and there was a mist of water in front of her eyes. She said cautiously, \u201cI vaguely feel uncomfortable recently. Can you help me find a doctor again? I still cherish my life. You don\u2019t want me to\u2026.\u201dZhao Nanyu interrupted her without permission, \u201cI know. \u201dSong Luan went around and told him that she didn\u2019t want to die ambiguously. She said all these with so much politeness because she didn\u2019t want Zhao Nanyu to know that she had discovered the poison.She added, \u201cI\u2019m afraid of pain and death. \u201dZhao Nanyu smiled at her, but the smile on the corner of his mouth was a little ugly. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, it won\u2019t hurt you. \u201dThere was a sneer in his eyes, and he suddenly understood how Song Luan suddenly threw herself to him so enthusiastically.He was told that she went out early this morning to see another doctor.Song Luan didn\u2019t know how many people he had arranged in the dark. Her every move could not be concealed from his eyes. It turned out that she knew about her poisoning, and then wanted him to help her detoxify, so she was willing to laugh at him and lie in a bed with him.No wonder it didn\u2019t feel like she likes him with her eyes. This was done everything just to achieve her goal.But it\u2019s okay to use him. It\u2019s important to use him.Zhao Nanyu could have asked the doctor to hide her poisoning, but he didn\u2019t. In his opinion, as long as Song Luan didn\u2019t know who poisoned her, it would be fine.\u201cThat\u2019s what you said. You can\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Song Luan was in a better mood at last, and was guaranteed to be overjoyed.\u201cNot lying to you.\u201dNow how could he still let her die, Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t wait to be in one body with her.There was a carriage waiting at the front door of Zhao\u2019s residence. Before Zhao Nanyu left, he took off the jade plate that was around his waist, and gently placed it beside her pillow. He bowed his head and kissed her forehead before leaving.That jade pendant was a relic left by his mother, who had already left him for more than 20 years.The fog was still heavy in the early morning. Zhao Nanyu said in a cold voice to the man hiding in the dark, \u201cLook after her.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen Song Luan woke up, the warmth around her had long been gone. She sat up with difficultly and was breathing in pain. The traces of blue and purple looked scary.Bah, Zhao Nanyu was a beast.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t suffer in vain last night. She also got a promise from Zhao Nanyu. Although the man was vicious, he still kept his words. She could relax for a while.Song Luan rested on the pillow for a long time. A servant girl outside began to knock on the door. \u201cMadam, are you awake?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dressing. Don\u2019t come in. \u201d\u201cYes. \u201dIt took Song Luan a long time to dress. Her legs trembled when her feet touched the ground. She scolded Zhao Nanyu in her heart again. She had a psychological shadow in her heart because of his actions.At a glance, she saw the jade pendant beside the pillow. She took it and looked at it carefully. She seemed to doubt that she had read it wrong.Song Luan rubbed her eyes and looked at it carefully again. She was sure that it was Zhao Nanyu\u2019s most precious jade pendant.Song Luan\u2019s psychological pressure suddenly increased. Not that she was being arrogant, but she felt that the weight of this jade plate was more important than Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart.She put the jade pendant back in place, thinking that Zhao Nanyu was too anxious to go out and left it at home. Anyway, she didn\u2019t dare to touch it.The sunshine outside was brighter than any days. People couldn\u2019t open their eyes freely because of the strong golden rays. Song Luan just had lunch, and little Zhao came to find her to play the chess game they played last time.The child was still embarrassed to express himself. After a long time of embarrassment, he rubbed at her trouser legs in a red face and says, \u201cMother, I want to play chess with you. \u201dSong Luan had nothing to do today. She touched her nose, smiled and replied, \u201cOkay. \u201dLittle Zhao was generally interested in everything. He didn\u2019t really like playing chess, but he came to her with an excuse to play chess so he could get closer to her.The sun was too strong, Song Luan hugged him and went inside the residence. She now felt the struggle to hold her son. The child grew very fast, he was heavier than before.He climbed on the bench and straightened his back. Song Luan wanted to laugh every time she saw him act mature. This little adult.\u201cDo you want to eat? \u201d\u201cI came here on a full stomach.\u201d He replied seriously, with a straight face.Song Luan nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d She smiled and pinched the flesh on his face. \u201cWould you like to have dinner with me tonight? Do you want mother to cook the duck soy sauce for you?\u201dHe didn\u2019t have a strong taste and didn\u2019t eat duck soy sauce, but if it was made by his mother, he would like to eat.He nodded seriously. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe liked her, but was embarrassed to say it. Every time he come to find his mother, he had a lot of words to say, but is always stuck in his throat.He would just stare at her, obediently and docilely. He would do whatever her mother wanted.After two games of chess, it was time for lunch break.After coaxing her son to sleep, she planned to go to the kitchen to prepare the ingredients for braised duck with soy sauce.\u00a0At last, the sun outside the window became gentle. She stretched her waist and was about to go to the kitchen, but suddenly, a head appeared on the wall. Song Luan stared at him with round eyes.All of a sudden, there were many fragments of scenes appeared in her mind.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? \u201c\u201cHuai Jin. \u201c\u201cI\u2019ve bought you. You should listen to me. \u201c\u201cOkay.\u201d The young man stared at the gorgeous beauty in front of him, and there was a flower blooming in his heart.**\u201cAh Luan, your husband is so fierce. Why do I think he wants to kill me. \u201c**The beautiful young man sat in the high courtyard wall and looked at the quiet man with a smile. \u201cAh, second young master, you are not worthy of our Ah Luan. Don\u2019t look for her. She is still sleeping. She was too tired last night. \u201c**\u201cAh Luan, wait for me. I will find a way to save your life and kill the dog man.\u201d**Finally, the scene ended on the young man with blood. He fell on the way to find the antidote for her. He was frozen to death in the ice and snow. His eyes were wide open as he died.Song Luan suddenly returned to her consciousness. There were many memories in her mind that do not belong to her. In \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, only the original owner and the men that surrounded her were not clear. Their names were not written.She said doubtfully, \u201cHuai Jin? \u201dThe man jumped down from the wall and turned around her. \u201cDo you want to die, Ah Luan! You didn\u2019t come to see me for so many days. I thought you died in another man\u2019s bed! \u201dSong Luan\u2019s mouth twitched, so Huai Jin subconsciously answered, \u201cI have become a good man \u201dHuai Jin chuckled and pointed to her neck directly. \u201cDid that dog nibble your neck? I thought I\u2019ll go blind.\u201d\u201cI dared to come in when I heard your husband was away. The dead man was so vicious that I was almost killed by him last time.\u201dSong Luan asked, \u201cYou looked for me. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cTake a look.\u201d The expression on his face turned sharply, and he waved his sleeve fiercely. It seemed that he was losing his temper.Huai Jiin squinted at her. \u201cNo, this traces of mark won\u2019t come off easily, right?\u201dSong Luan knew he was right when she didn\u2019t make a sound. He was angry. He pointed at her and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want to leave him? How can you change your mind!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be with you, but not now.\u201d Song Luan thought of the tragic death of Huai Jin in the future, but she didn\u2019t have the heart to be too cruel to him.In fact, she didn\u2019t think that the original owner was such a scum, how could the luck of peach blossom not be bad?Huai Jin turned a white eye at her. \u201cYou want to have another child for him and then leave? Wow you are so great.\u201dSong Luan thought how poisonous this man\u2019s words were. He clearly liked the original owner, but he pretended to be free and easy.\u201cHuai Jin, I have something else to do. Why don\u2019t you get out of the wall?\u201d She whispered to him.Huai Jin\u2019s face was green, and he gnawed his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, hmp! You, You must remember to come to me.\u201dSong Luan was not going to look for him, but Huai Jin just said something that reached her heart.She wanted to run. But she couldn\u2019t think of thoughts like this for now\u2026She had to make up for the mistakes of the past, then go far away after being at peace with Zhao Nanyu. In the future, they would just mind their own business. This was the best solution for a couple who was forced to marry.But the feeling of not being able to escape was annoying.She looked up at the sky and thought wistfully. She didn\u2019t know if Zhao Nanyu had met the female lead now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Luan really became a stupid hoe.\u00a0( \u2579\u0a0a\u2579)\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fTranslated by: TinkerThe mountain path was shaded by trees. The carriage was traveling on a bumpy road. They took the road that were not known to most people. No travellers were in vicinity except for them. The sound of rolling wheels was accompanied by the rustling wind and the swaying leaves.The carriage suddenly stopped halfway. The coachman in the carriage suddenly screamed. He yanked the rope to a halt. He stared at the murderous man in black in front, and could not speak clearly, \u201cMaster\u2026Master, ahead..\u201dThe man didn\u2019t wait for the driver to finish his speech. A cold light flashed, and the sharp blade had cut his throat.With a sneer, the men in black immediately came to the carriage with swords.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t panic, and flew over the sword tip that was coming to him. He noticed he had a long sword in his hands and had no idea where this came from.He laughed at the men in black, seeming not worried that he could get away from this predicament.Zhao Nanyu was surrounded, their knives pointed straight at him. These people had made poison vows to take his life.They are trained dead men, and they were either going to die or not.The sword was stretched and the crossbow was drawn.Zhao Nanyu had long known that the road to Quzhou would not go smoothly. No one in Dali Temple wanted to take over the mess of the murdered governer Quzhou. The old emperor seemed to deliberately gave this case to him.Quzhou could be a regarded as a cold place with high mountains and long rivers. It was normal for officials to protect each other. The magistrate that replaced the previous was cunning. Within three months, he had cleared a group of local merchants and small officials around him.It\u2019s not impossible to deal with the embezzlement of offcials and businessmen.Zhao Nanyu, who went to investigate the case, naturally would not be welcoming. If he found something, Quzhou\u2019s officials would have to be replaced again. So the people behind the scenes certainly didn\u2019t want him to arrive in Quzhou alive.After the intense swords clashing, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s white clothes were splashed with bright red blood. He was like an asura in hell. He looked at the lying corpses who came to kill him. His body was also stabbed with many wounds, so he was only able to stand with the support of his sword. He was fortunately not hurt badly.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s knees fell straight on the stone road with a sound of a \u2018bang\u2019. His brow wrinkled with pain. He gasped for breath and endured the sharp pain from the wound. He didn\u2019t emit any sound.Suddenly, he heard a voice coming from the grass. Zhao Nanyu squeezed the sword handle in his hand, thinking it was the fish that had leaked from the net. He was ready to raise the sword and kill him.A young girl with a round face wearing pink clothes suddenly rushed out with a medicine basket in her hand. The girl\u2019s appearance was not excellent compared with other beautiful women. She knelt down in front of Zhao Nanyu, frowned, and looked at the wound on him. \u201cAre you okay? \u201dZhao Nanyu still held the sword handle tightly, and there was cold light in his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThe girl stared at the man in front of her. She had never seen such a beautiful man since she was born.Although there was blood on his face at the moment, it did not hinder his excellent appearance.The girl swallowed her saliva, bit her lower lip and said, \u201cYou are injured. I have medicine here. I can help you. \u201dZhao Nanyu lowered his eyes, raised his eyelids again, and looked at her coldly. His eyes were obviously murderous. He spit out a word, \u201cGo away.\u201dThe young girl was not discouraged and did not give up. Even though her eyes were red, she pretended to be strong. \u201cI am not a bad person. I just want to save you. If you bleed like this, you will die.\u201dZhao Nanyu only felt that she deliberately squeezed her voice and pretended to be aggrieved, which made him nauseous. He laughed in a low voice and his smile coul penetrate people. \u201cGo away, or I will stab you to death with a sword.\u201dThe girl was so scared that her face paled. She didn\u2019t doubt the truthfulness of his words, and was very aggrieved that she bit her lower lip. She looked at him pitifully, but saw the killing intention in his eyes were even worse. She quickly stood up and ran away.***All of these\u2026 Song Luan, who was far away in the capital, naturally didn\u2019t know. She thought the man and the woman had fallen in love at first sight! She didn\u2019t expect that the female lead would become a cannon fodder so easily.She was busy cooking, and had time to think freely after making good dishes that her son loves to eat. Song Luan felt that something had changed since her fainting, just like when she saw Huai Jin today. Many plots that she had not read in the book were all drilled into her brain, which caused her to feel some pain.The more she thought about it, the more painful it became. Song Luan simply chose not to think of this anymore.The sky in the distance gradually darkened. After the sun went down, the weather suddenly became cold. Song Luan went back to the house and added a piece of clothes. Later, she went to the room to wake up her son.After entering the room, she found that the child had woken up. A four-year-old child, who was still sleepy, didn\u2019t know want to do. Despite his refusal, Song Luan dressed his clothes one by one and patted his head, \u201cHow was your sleep?\u201dLittle Zhao nodded honestly, \u201cGood.\u201dHe seldom sleeps long during naps. But everytime he sleeps in his mother\u2019s room, his sleep would become particularly sweet.Song Luan found that she really liked the child more and more. Her patience became better in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to wash your face, and then we can have dinner together, Okay? \u201dShe would always ask questions when talking to children. She wanted to fully respect her child\u2019s opinions.\u00a0No matter what she asked, there was always only one good answer. He never contradicted nor refuse.His father seldom asked his opinion. He always made the decisions before asking him.Little Zhao used to think that he only liked his father. Now, he liked both his father and mother very much. It would be nice if this would stay like this all his life.He held his mother\u2019s hands and asked what was in his heart, \u201cMother, will I have brothers and sisters in the future?\u201dHe was not afraid of being alone, but he was still a chilld after all. He would occasionally envy his cousins who gathered to play together. He also wanted to have brothers and sisters so that they could play together. He would work hard to protect them in the future.Song Luan didn\u2019t know how to answer him. She thought sadly, how good would it be if the male lead and the original owner were a loving couple. But the husband and wife were not normal people. The man was cruel and ruthless, and the original owner was also vicious and heartless.She was looked at by her son\u2019s soft and cute eyes, and her soft heart turned into a pool of water directly, \u201cThere will be some.\u201dNonsense. Probably not.At the end of \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, she didn\u2019t see Zhao Nanyu and other women had children. Even the female lead didn\u2019t have the honor. Based on Song Luan\u2019s many years of experience with an overbearing male lead, she reasonably speculated that the reason why Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want another children was because he was reluctant to let the female lead pass the ghost gate, or let her suffer pain.Little Zhao\u2019s eyes curved with a smile and said seriously, \u201cI will be a good brother.\u201dSong Luan was amused by him. \u201cBrother is very powerful.\u201dThe little child blushed red, and it reached his ears. They were very hot.Song Luan made him blush, and laughed. She thought that if she really had a chance to stay away from the male lead in the future, she would be very reluctant since her son was sensible and obedient.In the evening meal, Song Luan wished to put all the delicious food on the table into the stomach of her son. She fed him until he was full. She really didn\u2019t understand how the original owner was able to watch this child break his legs.Not all stepmothers were cruel.Thinking of this, Song Luan was more fond of her son. She fed him and played games with him. After an hour, she told the servants to fetch water and plan to personally give him bath.Little Zhao\u2019s little hand clutched her skirt, refused to let her take off his clothes. He blushed and wanted to take a bath by himself.Song Luan could not resist him, so she went away unease. She waited outside and called his name from time to time, for fear that he would choke the water and not make a sound.Zhao Nanyu was not at home, so her son lived with her this time. She wanted to do what she always wanted.\u00a0At night, she asked the people in the front yard to bring over little Zhao\u2019s pajama and bedding, and let him sleep in her room for one night.When preparing the bed, Song Luan caught a glimpse of the jade pendant that she had put beside her pillow. She carefully picked it up and thought about it. After all, this was Zhao Nanyu\u2019s treasure, and it was the only relic left by his mother. It was better to lock it in the cabinet so as not to make mistakes.In the absence of Zhao Nanyu, Song Luan had a very happy life. She ate two bowls of rice every day. The days were very good.Third lady Zhao seemed to know that they had finally shared the same room again. She was very pleased. She called her to talk several days in a row. Because of this, Song Luan met Zhao Wenyan several times, but the two brother and sister in-laws did not greet each other when they met, pretending to be worse than strangers.Zhao Wenyan didn\u2019t hate this sister-in-law so much than before. He heard that she stayed at home safely for a while, didn\u2019t go out to make trouble and didn\u2019t disgrace his second brother. She was willing to give her husband a good face.But Song Luan couldn\u2019t see him at all in her eyes. She regarded Zhao Wenyan as a younger brother who was ignorant. After he came out of the shock of being defeated, she didn\u2019t plan to communicate with him.When Zhao Wenyan saw that she ignored him, he became strangely sullen, thinking that women were fickle.When the meal was half eaten, he threw his chopsticks away and left his mother\u2019s yard in a huff. Third lady Zhao felt that his son had been really spoiled by her. He was already old and still had a child\u2019s temper.It took another half a month for Zhao Nanyu to come back from Quzhou.He came back later than expected. Song Luan heard that something happened on the way.\u00a0She guessed nervously that maybe the female lead appeared, and the two were chirping on the road and got delayed.However, when Zhao Nanyu\u2019s carriage stopped at the door of his residence, the curtain of the carriage opened, and he was the only one who came down from it.Song Luan was confused. Hey, what about the female lead???She looked around for a long time and didn\u2019t see a woman!Why was the female lead gone?!!Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was sickly white and coughed several times. He looked at her funny and asked, \u201cWhat are you looking for? \u201dSong Luan shook her head. \u201cNothing.\u201dZhao Nanyu beckoned to her, \u201cCome here, give me a hand. \u201dShe ran over and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Are you hurt?\u201dZhao Nanyu coughed several more times, his pale face turned red gradually, his face was weak, and he made a low hum.Song Luan\u2019s mind circled. The plot had not changed! But the female lead?Zhao Nanyu clenched her wrist and glanced over her with a light tone, pretending to ask casually, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing the jade pendant I gave you?\u201dSong Luan was dumbfounded. That is, the most precious jade plate of the man who kills without a thought, was given to her? She didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cThat jade pendant is too precious. You\u2019d better keep it yourself.\u201d She said weakly.Zhao Nanyu stopped, pinched her hand, and smiled, \u201cPut it on around you with a red rope, okay?\u201dIt was clearly said with a gentle tone, but her scalp tingled when she listened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The plot of the original book was distorted because Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t follow the original path. She was a bit at a loss.In fact, Song Luan was deeply impressed with the jade pendant in the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, because it was written that after Zhao Nanyu became an important minister in court, many women wanted to climb his bed. Once, there was a woman who failed to climbed the bed who rushed away leaving, but because she was in a hurry, she broke the jade pendant with her feet, and it shattered.The woman\u2019s family background was not high nor low, and her father was a fourth-rank official. In an instant, Zhao Nanyu dragged her out the room and killed her.No one in the court dared to stand as his opponent. He was capricious and ruthless. They didn\u2019t fight back against him.If he wants to kill, then kill.And, in almost at the end of the book, Song Luan didn\u2019t see who the male lead gave this piece of jade. Even the female lead couldn\u2019t get it. He had always been wearing it close to his body for ten years.All of a sudden, Zhao Nanyu wanted to give her such a precious thing. How could Song Luan not panic?Since he said he wanted her to wear it, the paranoid and overbearing character of his certainly wouldn\u2019t allow her to take it off in the future.One of the reasons why Song Luan wasn\u2019t brave was that she was careless. If incase she would break it one day, Zhao Nanyu would kill her like that woman. How pitiful.However, what she didn\u2019t understand was why would Zhao Nanyu be willing to give this jade pendant to her? Why??She was sure that it was impossible for him to like her.Was there any other reason? She couldn\u2019t think of anything anymore.Facing Zhao\u2019s dark eyes, she replied tensely, \u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Nanyu seemed to be satisfied with her answer. His fingers brushed her cheek gently, and his eyes curved and smiled.Song Luan felt scared and cold in her heart every time she saw him smile gently to her.Back in the bedroom, Zhao Nanyu asked people to take a few red strings. He then sat down, bowed his head, and began to weave the ropes seriously. His drooping eyes were particularly beautiful and gentle, which could confuse people.For a while, even Song Luan herself was stunned. She didn\u2019t expect Zhao Nanyu would make a red rope. His slender and white fingers were extremely flexible. He made the rope in three or two strokes.Then he raised his face and looked at her and said, \u201cTake the jade pendant. \u201dSong Luan walked to the cabinet, opened it, and took out the jade pendant from the sachet. She reluctantly pass it to him.Zhao Nanyu put the red rope into the small hole of the jade pendant, and then stood up. He was tall and slender. Song Luan just reached his shoulder when she stood with him. Only when she looked up could she see the expression on his face.Zhao Nanyu gently tied the red rope to her slender snow-white neck. He seemed very happy and asked, \u201cDo you like it?\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t answer that she didn\u2019t like it. Her hand touched the jade pendant on her neck involuntarily, with a complex expression, \u201cI like it.\u201dZhao Nanyu naturally put his arms around her waist, held her in his arms, put his chin on her shoulder, closed his eyes slightly, and sighed, \u201cYou like it.\u201dShe was his and couldn\u2019t ran away from him anymore.Although Song Luan was held by him many times, she was still nervous. Her limbs were stiff and she didn\u2019t know where to put her hands. She suddenly opened her mouth and asked him roundly, \u201cI heard that there were many beautiful girls in Quzhou. Have you met one or two? \u201dSong Luan quickly added, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you hadn\u2019t, I won\u2019t believe it.\u201dZhao Nanyu bent his lips and smiled. He misunderstood that she was jealous. He replied, \u201cNone.\u201d\u201cYou lied to me. \u201dSince he was injured, it was impossible that he did not meet the hostess. As for why he was the only one to go back to the capital without seeing the female lead, it must be what happened in the middle.Zhao Nanyu was used to her little temper, and kissed the corner of her mouth, \u201cNo.\u201dSong Luan was a little discouraged and gave up.After Zhao Nanyu stayed long enough, he went to the front yard to see his son. It\u2019s been long\u2026he hadn\u2019t seen him in a month. The child would naturally miss him.Zhao Nanyu checked his son\u2019s homework and then picked up the child. Little Zhao subconsciously covered Zhao Nanyu\u2019s neck with his little arms. He stayed with his mother these days when his father is away.Little Zhao had already fallen in love with his mother\u2019s unique fragrance. He slept comfortably with his mother every day. Now that his father was back, the child didn\u2019t know whether he could continue to sleep with his mother. He probably couldn\u2019t.His father never indulged him, but he still couldn\u2019t help it. He opened his mouth and asked in a low voice, \u201cFather, can I sleep with my mother tonight?\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t even think about it, \u201cNo way. \u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s mouth drooped and his face was downcast, \u201cOkay.\u201dHis father didn\u2019t allow it. Crying and selling pitiful faces won\u2019t change his mind.Little Zhao didn\u2019t know that his father was injured. He was carried all the way to Song Luan\u2019s residence. When he put the child down, Song Luan found that his light clothes had been stained with slight red blood. The wound had opened.Song Luan quickly carried her son into the inner room and didn\u2019t want him to see the picture.Then she came out and kindly reminded him, \u201cYour wound is opened!\u201dJust now when she saw that he still had strength to walk, she thought that his injury was not heavy. The original book really didn\u2019t deceive people. Serious injury was really a serious injury. But this ittle pervert, this male lead, was very tolerant. No one would have noticed this wound if not for his pale face.Zhao Nanyu sat down and began to undress in front of her. When he was finally naked, he uncovered the gauze covering the wound. The wound was still open, and blood still ran out. Unwrapping the gauze took a long time. Some of the cloth was stuck to his flesh. Song Luan felt pain when looking at this. Zhao Nanyu looked fine, he pulled the gauze off without a flicker on his face.Song Luan, unable to look anymore, took the initiative and said, \u201cI\u2019ll get the medicine for you.\u201dZhao Nanyu was resting on the back of the bed. \u201cBy the way, please help me with the medicine. \u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t dare at all. She couldn\u2019t bear to look at the wounds on his chest more than once. She actually felt dizzy. It was hard for her to see the blood. But after transmigrating, the symptom became better, but only a little.Song Luan shivered and handed the medicine to him. \u201cYou have to do it yourself. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll hurt you. \u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t bother her. He quickly applied the medicine to himself. Then, he slightly closed his shirt. His face was beautiful and dazzling under the candle fire.Song Luan swallowed her saliva and felt that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s appearance was really attracting to her. The words \u2018beautiful\u2019 and \u2018handsome\u2019 could be used on him at the same time.She looked out of the window. It was dark before she knew it.The dinner table had already been arranged. Song Luan and her son were sitting on one side, while Zhao Nanyu was sitting on the other side alone.There was only the sound of chopsticks as they ate. As long as Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t initiate the talk, Song Luan would just stay silent and wouldn\u2019t dare to speak first.Song Luan didn\u2019t eat much during the quiet dinner. The jade pendant around her neck made her feel uneasy, as if she had been labeled as this man\u2019s and could never escape.After that, Zhao Nanyu ordered his servant to take little Zhao back to his own room, and only the two of them were left in the master bedroom.Song Luan found it stressful to be alone with Zhao Nanyu each time, so she soon ran off and slipped away to bathe.Hearing the sound of the water behind the screen, Zhao Nanyu stood silently for a while, then stepped out of the room. The people hiding in the dark appeared behind him.In the dark night, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was difficult to discern.The guard reported to him the days when he was not around. Included in the report was that Song Luan and Huai Jin met several times. The look between Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyebrows and eyes was cold.\u201cGo now.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201dAfter Song Luan finished her bath, she went to dress. She wanted to take the jade pendant off her neck several times, so she stretched her hand to remove it but then was counseled to wear it back. She had no power to tie the chicken. She was not Zhao Nanyu\u2019s opponent in the future. To disobey and rebel against him would be tantamount to death.***She was so upset that she always felt that this thing hanging around neck made her one of his possessions.Song Luan sighed. She put on her clothes and went out from the screen. Zhao Nanyu seemed to have been waiting for her for a long time.She just came out of the water, wrapped in a mist, her face was rosy, her lips were red, and a few drops of water were hanging on her forehead. She was a delicate flower, waiting to be picked.The look in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were very familiar, it was exactly the same as when he was drugged that night.Song Luan shivered all over, and her heart was tight. She was so afraid of the beast Zhao Nanyu in bed.As long as you don\u2019t go to bed, you can say anything.The night they had sex, there was only endless tossing and turning. She was humby begging for mercy as she sobbed. She was in a mess.Song Luan walked cautiously, naively thinking that he wouldn\u2019t do anything to her with his wounds.When she was close to him, he suddenly grabbed her wrist and threw her in middle of the bed. His hands were leaning against her ear, and he looked at her from the top. His eyes deepened.Song Luan shrunk her shoulders, afraid that he would eat her raw. She said, \u201cYour wound\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu lowered his head, bit her lips, and licked the blood that spilled from her little mouth. He untied her belt and replied, \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt.\u201dHis kiss fell on her facial features and licked the remaining blood from her lips.Song Luan was really terrified. She struggled as she resisted, but he was holding her waist. The man saw her doing meaningless struggle, and gave a soft laugh.He controlled her waist and stroked her butterfly bone with his fingers. \u201cBe good.\u201dSong Luan heard the meaning of threat from his simple three words.He seemed to be saying, \u201cDo it or die\u201dShe couldn\u2019t afford it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man was silent as he removed her clothes. His cool fingers were clasped around her waist, which was heavier than before.Song Luan\u2019s strength was not as strong as his, so she wouldn\u2019t resist. She just hope that he could be gentle this time, but Zhao Nanyu, no matter how amiable he looked, was a totally different person in bed.And Song Luan soon discovered a bad flaw of his. Zhao Nanyu would never stop until tears would be forced out her eyes, as she begged for mercy. In the end, Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand it so she just scratched his back with her fingernails, and asked him to stop while weeping.Zhao Nanyu smiled and was in a good mood. He lowered his head and kissed the tears on her cheek, as if sighing. He asked, \u201cDo you like me?\u201dSong Luan rolled up her quilt and wrapped herself tightly. She didn\u2019t want to say it but had no choice, \u201cI like you.\u201dZhao Nanyu heard those dry words without love. He was actually amused by her straightforward and superficial attitude.Song Luan slept soundly until the dawn. What\u2019s rare was that Zhao Nanyu was still at home. He didn\u2019t speak much, and the couple spent most of their time together without talking. Song Luan was used to silence.After breakfast, third lady Zhao sent someone to deliver a message to invite them to have lunch together.It\u2019s also because good things happened that the third lady would call Zhao Nanyu. She was not a good stepmother. She was not close to Zhao Nanyu these years, but she was considerate in all aspects and kept a proper distance.It was Zhao Wenyan who was fortunate enough to study in Yueshan academy this year. The teacher of the academy was a famous scholar in the capital. He was only willing to recruit three or four students every year. The quota was quite expensive. Zhao Wenyan was still young. Now he studied with famous teachers, and was not afraid of failing in the future.It was a good thing. No wonder that when Song Luan arrived, third lady Zhao still had a big smile on her face. After getting along with her several times, Song Luan found that third lady Zhao had a soft temper, a soft ear, and a soft root. She treated everyone well.Zhao Wenyan was dressed in a blue suit, and his black hair was tied up high. He was a young man with an awe-inspiring demeanor. He stood under the tree with his chin up, looked up at Song Luan, and snorted disgustingly. Song Luan had long been surprise. Every time the child saw her, he looked like this\u2013like a proud peacock. Neither of his eyes look straight at her.Zhao Nanyu intentionally blocked her body, moved her intimately, took her small hand, and walked into the room together with their fingers intertwined. Third lady Zhao was very pleased to see that they had good feelings.Family matters were okay. These two children didn\u2019t give her anymore trouble.The maidservants had started to prepare the dishes, but the third master Zhao hadn\u2019t come back.Several people sat in house and talked. It was Song Luan and the third lady Zhao who were talking most of the time. Zhao Nanyu listened silently and rarely made a sound.After a while, the third master Zhao arrived. He first went back to the room and changed his clothes before he came out.Zhao Nanyu took the time to go outside. Zhao Wenyan was still standing under the tree. His face was wild, some of his baby features faded a little bit, and looked more mature. He was handsome.He knew of Zhao Wenyan\u2019s failure, and then he knew that he wanted to die and made a lot of trouble. But throughout this event, Zhao Nanyu never came out and said words of relief to his brother. It was good for the boy to suffer some setbacks.\u00a0Later, he heard Song Luan\u2019s words to him, and it made Ayan rise up.Zhao Nanyu came up to him and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cAyan.\u201dZhao Wenyan was tensed, \u201cSecond brother.\u201dZhao Nanyu was still very fond of his younger brother, Ayan. If anything would happen, he would protect him. He smiled gently. \u201cYou will go to the academy in a few days.\u201dZhao Wenyan nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cKeep yourself from arrogance and carelessness. Learn from Mr. Du, understand?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d He paused, thought about it, and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to stay in the academy.\u201dMr. Du requested that all students must live in the academy.Zhao Nanyu thought that his younger brother\u2019s innocence really followed his mother, \u201cThen don\u2019t go.\u201dZhao Wenyan closed his mouth and didn\u2019t say a word. If he didn\u2019t go, his mother would kill him. He would not dare to be as headstrong as before after this year.Zhao Nanyu put his hand on his back and looked at the fallen leaves calmly. After a long time, he suddenly asked, \u201cAyan, do you have a girl you like?\u201dZhao Wenyan\u2019s whole body was tense and his heart was tight. His hand under his sleeve clenched into fist, then his five fingers loosened. For a moment, he could not even make a sound. Just then, Song Luan\u2019s face flashed in his mind. A short moment was enough to make him uncomfortable for a long time.He was stuck in his throat and lowered his head. \u201cNo.\u201dZhao Nanyu knew that Song Luan had entangled with him before. At that time, he didn\u2019t pay too much attention as he saw that his brother was disgusted of her.It was just yesterday that his guards told him that Zhao Wenyan\u2019s actions towards Song Luan seemed to be different. He was able to sit and talk with her calmy without ridiculing her.Zhao Nanyu had a keen intuition. He didn\u2019t like Song Luan talking to other men. Even if that man was his younger brother, even if they just talk, he would be uncomfortable for a long time.He was jealous. He knew it won\u2019t happen if he says it won\u2019t.Zhao Nanyu closed his eyes, and the fine wind brushed his cheek. He thought of her delicate and frail appearance, her eyes covered with water, and her lips that would slightly raised. He immediately opened his eyes, and looked at Zhao Wenyan meaningfully, saying, \u201cYou are approaching the age of marriage. If you have a girl you like, you must tell your mother, she will surely help you.\u201dZhao Wenyan\u2019s voice dropped a lot. It was not hard to hear the disappointment. He even dared not look up at his second brother, \u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cCome in, father has come back. \u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Sanye was also in a good mood today. It didn\u2019t affect his mood at all even when he saw his elder son who he didn\u2019t like very much. He was nice enough to say a word to Zhao Nanyu, \u201cEverything is well in Quzhou?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s done. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine that you did not get any scratch.\u201dSong Luan held the chopstick and was uncomfortable in heart. It seemed that no one else in this family knew Zhao Nanyu\u2019s injury except her. He didn\u2019t say it himself. Now his father asked about it, and he didn\u2019t even mention it.Zhao Sanye swallowed a mouthful of liquor, grinned and looked at his two sons. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t lose the Zhao\u2019s face when you go out.\u201dHis loving eyes completely turned to Zhao Wenyan as he continued,\u201dAyan was picked up by Mr. Du this time to be a student and it gave me face. You can speak in front of the emperor, Ayan. You must seize the opportunity, okay?\u201dZhao Wenyan frowned. He didn\u2019t like his father saying these things in front of his second brother. \u201cDad, I know it from my own heart. Besides, I go to school to study, not to bow to others.\u201dBesides, Mr. Du certainly didn\u2019t like flattery.When Zhao Sanye saw that his son didn\u2019t want to mention it, he immediately didn\u2019t say, \u201cOkay. Dad won\u2019t say it anymore.\u201dSong Luan pretended not to hear anything. She lowered her head and devoted herself to eating the food in front of her. Zhao Nanyu took two pieces of crystal clear meat and placed it into her bowl. \u201cEat more.\u201dSong Luan was a meat eater. The cooking in the Zhao family didn\u2019t really suit her taste. The soup had little water, not enough oil and didn\u2019t have any spicy flavor. She didn\u2019t expect that Zhao Nanyu would be so considerate.During the dinner, Song Luan was only interested in eating. She didn\u2019t need to take any dishes. Zhao Nanyu did all the work for her. The man seemed to be happy to do such a thing. He was not impatient at allShe didn\u2019t say a word to minimize her sense of being. Zhao Sanye didn\u2019t like his daughter-in-law either. He didn\u2019t look her in the eye from beginning to end and ignored her directly.Zhao Nanyu accompanied Zhao Sanye to drink two glasses. Zhao Wenyan was still young so he was not included.Zhao Sanye had a good time. It was late when he was finally willing to put down his glass and let the servants help him up.Zhao Nanyu was not so good either. His ears were red, but it was not obivious. His skin was white, and his face was no smilling. He still looked like a noble and an inviolable fairy.He and Song Luan didn\u2019t plan to stay any longer. Before they left, third lady Zhao San suddenly stopped her. She looked at her with complicated eyes and began to worry. \u201cAh Luan, I don\u2019t think you look very well when I look at you.\u201dSong Luan subconciously touched her cheek, \u201cAh? Really? I feel okay. \u201dThird lady Zhao said, \u201cYou look a bit haggard. Your face is too pale. I don\u2019t know if you are ill.\u201dSong Luan smiled awkwardly. She didn\u2019t have any problems these days. She didn\u2019t feel pain or any dizziness. \u201cMaybe I have too much powder today, so I looked pale.\u201dThird lady Zhao was still uneasy. She asked people to take out the tonic she had prepared and hand it to her. \u201cTake these tonics and drink them. The woman\u2019s body can\u2019t be ruined. I\u2019m waiting for you to add another younger brother or sister for little Zhao.\u201dZhao Nanyu intercepted the medicine in his own hands. After thanking third lady Zhao, he took Song Luan\u2019s hand and left.Song Luan thought she wouldn\u2019t be able to finish all the supplements she gave her, but it was not until they returned to the yard that Zhao Nanyu threw the supplements in his hand to the young man and told him lightly, \u201cThrow them away. \u201dSee, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s dominance as a male lead was vividly reflected from this scene.Ugh. So annoying.Zhao Nanyu suddenly hugged her and buried his face in her neck. The hot breath made her itch. She heard him say, \u201cWhat do you want? I\u2019ll find it for you. Don\u2019t get it from others.\u201dShe could only eat what he gave.Song Luan was speechless. She dared not touch what he gave her, okay!?Zhao Nanyu had a faint smell of wine. He raised his face and looked at her with dark eyes. He smiled a little bit.Perhaps because of the effects of strong wine that he said, \u201cDo you know? Ah Yan likes you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Song Luan thought for a moment and the details that she had neglected for a long time. She had been deliberately trying to avoid the storyline before the events in the book happened.But although some things had changed, the result was not different.She worked hard to create the image of a good wife and mother in Zhao\u2019s house.She wanted the man to show mercy and spare her life, but she was still poisoned, though not deeply yet.She intended to avoid contact with Zhao Wenyan and didn\u2019t want to let the boy with a miserable ending fall in love with her, but he still did.Some details that she didn\u2019t notice before seemed to confirm her speculation. The endings and other emotional lines of people around her had changed.\u00a0It seemed that everything related to her was slowing walking towards the line of the original book.Song Luan\u2019s mind was a little confused. She shook her head and wanted to throw away all the bad ideas in her mind, so as to avoid scaring herself.She smiled laughed and tried to say in a light and lively tone, \u201cAh Yu, are you drunk?! You began to say silly things.\u201dZhao Nanyu was not drunk. He said this sentence deliberately to scare her. He wanted to see what kind of performance she would have.He didn\u2019t plan to calculate such old accounts with her. He knew that Song Luan\u2019s past would kill him.Zhao Nanyu nodded, still closed his eyes. \u201cMhm, I\u2019m drunk.\u201dSong Luan exhaled steadily from her chest, and helped him with difficulty. \u201cThen go to bed earlier.\u201d\u201cI have a headache.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Song Luan then said, \u201cMaybe you drank too much.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZhao Nanyu refused to say what he wanted her to do, and Song Luan was too lazy to guess.\u00a0She helped Zhao Nanyu to the bed and took off his shoes. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the kitchen and bring you a bowl of sober soup.\u201dZhao Nanyu held her cuff tightly with one hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to drink, and Song Luan just didn\u2019t want to serve. At this time, she was tired physically and mentally. She just wanted to roll into the bed and get a good sleep.Song Luan looked down and saw his face-like-jade. The man\u2019s lips were red, his eyes were beautiful, and his facial features were vividly more exquisite. She licked her lips and looked at Zhao Nanyu\u2019s alluring face a hundred times more and felt that her tiredness dissipated.Song Luan unconsciously stretched out her fingers and carefully painted his face with her touch. Suddenly, she realized what she was doing, and quickly took back her hand and felt that her fingertips were hot.Song Luan forgot to take off her clothes and laid traight to the bed. Her back faced the man as she drifted soon to sleep.In the middle of the night, Song Luan felt very hot in her sleep. Her forehead began to sweat, and drops of water began to drip down the outline of her cheeks.Song Luan couldn\u2019t wake up in her dream. She only felt that she was trapped in a stove and was blocked by iron walls in four directions. She was forced into a small room and her limbs seem to be trapped\u2013unabling her to move.She couldn\u2019t stand it, and gave it two bangs. Gradually the shackles on her body loosened, a cold hand reached into her collar, slowly untied the buttons, and took off her clothes.Song Luan, who was still in-betweens of dreaming, felt much cooler, and hummed comfortably. Suddenly, her lips felt cold, as if she was bitten.The next morning, after Song Luan woke up, the other side of the bed was empty. Zhao Nanyu had probably went out long ago.She got out of bed, looked at her face in the mirror, and stroked the lip with her fingers. Though it was painful, there were no wounds.Song Luan thought it was strange. She thought that she was bitten by Zhao Nanyu again last night. This person had a strange hobby. He liked to bite her lips every time he kisses, then licks and bites the same wound again and again.This time she didn\u2019t find the wound and could not help doubting her intuition. Didn\u2019t Zhao Nanyu do it?Thinking about it for a while, he was drunk last night and it was impossible to get up and bite her in the middle of the night!In fact, Song Luan didn\u2019t find any fun staying at her residence. She had no one to talk to and didn\u2019t have many good friends.As noon approached, the maidservant reported that the fifth miss of the Gu family came to visit.Gu Shuang, the fifth miss of Gu\u2019s family, was a close friend of the original owner. The friendship between the two was sincere.\u00a0In the original book, the two of them were described in four characters, \u201cIn Cahoots\u201d<blockquote>\u72fc\u72fd\u70ba\u5978 : a metaphor that means to collude with each other to do bad things.</blockquote>Gu Shuang was also a spoiled young lady. She was the only daughter in her family. Her four elder brothers loved her with no bottom line, and so she developed a temperament that was always doted and pampered on.The only difference between Gu Shuang and Song Luan was that she hadn\u2019t married yet.\u00a0Although she had a marriage agreement, her fiancee had to keep his father\u2019s filial piety for three years, and the marriage period had been delayed for three years.Gu Shuang was petite and her face was delicate. She appeared in front of her, and stared at her with her round eyes, \u201cAluan! Why haven\u2019t you come out to play with me lately?\u201dPerhaps influenced by this body, Song Luan had a natural sense of familiarity and intimacy when she saw her. She said with a smile, \u201cRecently busy.\u201dGu Shuang blinked, \u201cWhat are you busy with?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t answer her question. She asked, \u201cWhy are you here today? Do your brothers know?\u201dIt was not the first time for Gu Shuang to come to Zhao\u2019s residence. She sat down and took a big sip of tea. Then she said, \u201cOf course, my brother knows and they didn\u2019t want me to come, but can they control me? I\u2019m here to see you.\u201dSong Luan was interested in hearing funny stories. Her days in the backyard alone could be said to be boring! No fun!In ancient times, there was a lack of entertainment facilities. She was also a very poor cannon fodder, and no one was willing to have fun with her.As for the fun the original owner used to find, she dared not go on.Looking for a man in the kiln? She didn\u2019t have nine lives to live with. Besides being a wife and a mother, she really shouldn\u2019t do such a thing.<blockquote>\u7aaf\u5b50\u91cc (kiln): most direct and lowest sex transaction place in ancient country, formerly called brothel.</blockquote>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d She asked.Gu Shuang\u2019s eyes turned and took her arm. \u201cShall we go to drink and listen to the opera?\u201dThis was not out of line! Song Luan\u2019s eyes brightened, and immediately nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe women of this dynasty were not as deeply bound as those of other dynasties, at least it was not difficult to go out. Especially the bad tempered Song Luan, it was even easier for her to go out. No one dared to stop her.And Song Luan had asked Zhao Nanyu before. If he would get angry if she ever went out to go shopping.Zhao Nanyu looked at her with a smile, nodded and said, \u201cWill not.\u201dTwo words.In this case, Song Luan was more relieved.Gu Shuang pointed to her and said, \u201cAh Luan, haven\u2019t you slept well these days? How can you look so much worse than before?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well for a few days. \u201dShe was tossing and turning in bed with Zhao Nanyu these days and made her really exhausting.Gu Shuang said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you put on makeup, let\u2019s go out together beautifully!\u201dAs expected, she was a good sister who didn\u2019t want her to look ugly!\u201cOkay, please.\u201d\u201cBe kind to me.\u201dWhile Gu Shuang was helping her with her make-up, she could not stop her mouth and kept talking, \u201cMy second brother told me that you and your husband seem to have made up these days?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Gu Shuang\u2019s second brother said nothing wrong. They indeed reconciled.Gu Shuang smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s not bad. Your husband is handsome, and it\u2019s good if you\u2019re together.\u201dOf course, Song Luan knew that Zhao Nanyu was very handosme. She didn\u2019t need to be reminded of what she could see with her eyes.She thought of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s bright face in the moonlight. Her heart started pounding, and her beating speed was abnormal.Song Luan cleared her throat, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dTwo beautiful women walked side by side as they went out. Both looked like a delicate flower, so this attracted a lot of attention along the way.Gu Shuang seemed to have been used to this kind of eyes for a long time, but Song Luan still felt uncomfortable.They finally arrive at the restaurant where they could listen to the opera and drink wine. Gu Shuang seemed to be a regular customer. When the shopkeeper saw her, he immediately greeted her, with a kind smile on his face. \u201cMiss Gu, do you want an elegant room or in the lobby? \u201dThe restaurant was divided into two floors. On the second floor, there were elegant rooms and four square tables leaned by the stairs.Song Luan hadn\u2019t seen a large ancient restaurant before. She answered for Gu Shuang, \u201cLet\u2019s sit at a small table on the second floor.\u201d\u201cYes, upstairs, please.\u201d The shopkeeper took them to the stairway, hesitated and said, \u201cMadam, your brother is also drinking on the second floor.\u201dSong Heqing was here, too?Her brother was there, and her husband was sitting beside him too.Zhao Nanyu looked at her with a curved smile, his face full of spring breeze, and Song Luan was dumbfounded. She didn\u2019t expect to meet him.Song Heqing met Zhao Nanyu in the middle of the road today. He called his brother-in-law over to have a drink with him, and also wanted to talk about Song Luan on the way. After all, she was his sister. He had to help him as a brother no matter what she did.Fortunately, his sister and brother-in-law met coincidentally.Song Heqing looked at his silly sister, and looked at the man with a slightly cold temperament. He shook his head helplessly.His sister was really naive.Being a brother was very worrying.But Song Luan herself didn\u2019t feel anything. She didn\u2019t come out to find a wild man. She was full of confidence.And Zhao Nanyu said that he would not be angry if she went shopping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was really embarrassing for several people who know each other to coincidentally meet.He had also wanted to talk to Zhao Nanyu alone. Now, he had no chance to talk.He looked helplessly at the younger sister sitting on the edge. She was happy watching the play, like a small white eyed wolf with no heart, and looked very careless. Song Heqing, an old fox who had been mixing in the court matters for many years, was keen and sharp to details. Since Song Luan appeared, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s smile on her was a little cold.He did not fail to understand that no man like to see his wife in public, especially Song Luan, who had a long history of running out doing ridiculous things.Song Heqing couldn\u2019t help it. Song Luan was spoiled by her parents. She got anything she wanted when she was still young. As long as she opened her mouth, Aunt Lin would work hard to find everything for her and satisfy her wishes.Song Luan\u2019s beauty was so exquisite that ordinary people couldn\u2019t resist her crying. When others see her crying, they just wanted to give her all their heart so that she won\u2019t cry any more. So day after day, year after year, Song Luan was used to this exorbitant lifestyle.He guessed that Zhao Nanyu likes the same type of woman as him. A woman who was obedient and sensible, like a delicate flower that would make people want to protect it.Song Luan didn\u2019t look at Zhao Nanyu much. She was tired of watching Zhao Nanyu at home. She came out to have a walk, and wanted to see the dancing and singing in the restaurant.Song Luan held her chin and looked at the girls on the stage excitedly. She couldn\u2019t move her eyes. Gu Shuang had asked her to come out to drink. Since her brother and husband were here, she was not afraid to drink, so Gu Shang poured her a glass of wine and sent it to her.\u201cCome on, this wine is quite delicious.\u201dSong Luan had not drunk such a strong wine before. She poured a cup down her throat, and was about pour another cup for herself, but suddenly, someone grasped her wrist. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand was cold. He couldn\u2019t help but snatch the glass off her hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s too strong. You can\u2019t drink too much. \u201cHer body was fragile. It wouldn\u2019t be good to drink more.Even third lady Zhao found out that her face was not good recently. How could Zhao Nanyu not see it? He just didn\u2019t say it. He was afraid to scare Song Luan.Secretly, Zhao Nanyu ordered the kitchen to cook medicine meals these days. He couldn\u2019t figure out whether it was the poisoning that made Song Luan unhealthy.Song Heqing asked him drink together. The reason why Zhao Nanyu accepted was to ask him about Song Luan\u2019s palpitations.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t care about her life and death before, nor asked about her private affairs. But now, he wanted to know anything and everything about her.Song Heqing knew more than he did. He said that his sister\u2019s heart had no major problems, only that it was weak.Song Luan was born prematurely and was very fragile. She was carefully raised for a long time before she was cured. This made Aunt Lin dote on her daughter. She was constantly fed with good herbs to nourish her body.Song Luan knew that the strong quality of the wine was not good, and she had no choice but to let him drink it. \u201cThen I won\u2019t drink.\u201dGu Shuang looked at her and Zhao Nanyu. She was surprised that Song Luan looked like a paper tiger in front of her husband.Not only was she strange, but Song Heqing also felt that he had seen an evil ghost. He knew what virtue his sister had, and she had never been so obedient!!But now it\u2019s good. His sister\u2019s reputation wouldn\u2019t get worse. Before, Song Heqing was always worried that the two of them would separate. He was really afraid that his sister would not find other men willing to marry her in the future.Zhao Nanyu was a talented person. Although he was not loved by the emperor, he was also the special guest of the sixth prince. It\u2019s not clear what kind of person he would be in the future.Still couldn\u2019t look down on him.It was not easy for the four people to drink together. After half an hour, Song Heqing said that he would go first. Zhao Nanyu seemed to wait a long time and looked at Song Luan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back then. \u201cSong Luan didn\u2019t want to, she just came out and hadn\u2019t started shopping yet.She glanced at Gu Shuang, hinting at her with frantic eyes. Gu Shuang originally wanted to say something, but Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sharp eyes made her cold.Zhao Nanyu looked at her with a smile before he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen your brother for a long time. I will go see him and definitely greet him well tomorrow.\u201dGu Shuang immediately recognized that this was a direct threat. Her eldest brother was the one who was most strict with her. Today, she just sneaked out and didn\u2019t dare let her several elder brothers know that she escaped to find Song Luan.She knew her brothers would break her leg if they find out.Gu Shuang said with a dry smile, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go back..I seem to be very tired.\u201dBefore getting on the carriage, Song Heqing dragged Song Luan to talk. He lowered his voice for fear of being heard. \u201cDid you use the medicine I gave you last time? \u201cSong Luan really didn\u2019t want to recall this incident. It was all tears and blood. She clenched her teeth and two big words sprang out, \u201cAlready used!\u201dSong Heqing couldn\u2019t wait, \u201cHow did it go?\u201dWhat he wanted to ask was not the effect of the drug, but the relationship between them after the drug. Did their relationship became more pleasant?But Song Luan clearly misunderstood her brother\u2019s words, clenched her teeth, thought for a long time, and then spit out a few words, \u201cHe is too fierce!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSong Heqing\u2019s old face was red in a flash, his ears and neck were red. His sister really dared to say this kind of thing. He was ashamed to hear her words!!!Song Heqing was stuttering, and his words were all tangled, \u201cOur family\u2019s daughter speaks so\u2026oh\u2026I am really\u2026.I don\u2019t know what to say about you!\u201dSong Luan felt it was strange.. He wanted to ask her this! She was not even happy about answering him!\u201cYour medicine is strong.\u201dZhao Nanyu was not a human that night. It was like the beast within him had been summoned. She almost died.Song Heqing waved his hand. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t talk about this. You continue to have a good time with your husband. Also, show me little Zhao. I haven\u2019t seen my nephew in half a year.\u201dSong Heqing\u2019s incessant chatter was also worrying, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble again. You are not a child, can you be more sensible? \u201c\u201cBrother, I know.\u201dSong Heqing then handed her the purse at his waist. Every time he saw this sister, he would give her money for fear that she wouldn\u2019t have enough money to spend.On one hand, he told her not to go out, and on the other hand, he gave her money to shop and spend things.This was also typical for the Song family.Having said enough, Song Heqing finally got into his own carriage and went back to the Song Residence.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t feel impatient after waiting so long. When Song Luan got on the carriage, she found that this was not the direction to the residence at all.She turned and said, \u201cWhere are we going? \u201cZhao Nanyu replied, \u201cGo to the hospital.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t find Zhao Chao for a long time already. He couldn\u2019t wait. Couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He could only take her to the capital of the hospital first.\u201cIs your injury so serious?\u201d She didn\u2019t realize that the reason they were going to the hospital was because of her.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t answer.The carriage shook as it moved. She was about to fall asleep when Zhao Nanyu suddenly said, \u201cWhat did you want to do today?\u201dStrolling in a kiln to display her beauty? Or to simply slip out to drink?\u201cNothing to do.\u201dZhao Nanyu clasped her chin, gently stroked her ruddy lips with her fingers, and softly wiped off the rouge color on her lips. He took out his handkerchief from his sleeve, and slowly wiped all the makeup on her face.He said, \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to let others see you, because you are so beautiful today. \u201cHow could such a beautiful face be seen by others? What would I do if I\u2019m robbed?Song Luan looked at the person in front of her. Her lips were a little sore. She didn\u2019t understand. How could she not get angry? He also took off the makeup on her face.It\u2019s not light how he removed her makeup at all. Her sore eyes were about to burst into tears. Rough man!Song Luan didn\u2019t want to make the atmosphere stiff. She raised a big smile and said, \u201cI am beautiful every day.\u201dYes, so I didn\u2019t want you to go out every day.Song Luan, who was weak and beautiful, should stay in the huge and gorgeous cage he made.Zhao Nanyu nodded, \u201cWell, beautiful.\u201dSoon the carriage stopped in front of the hospital, and Zhao Nanyu took her by the hand and brought her in.Hou Taiyi, with grey hair and white beard, was over 60 years old, and his eyes were still bright and sharp.Zhao Nanyu greeted him, and said, \u201cI ask doctor Hou to check her pulse.\u201dHou Taiyi nodded.Song Luan now knew that the person to be looked at was her! However, she was quite willing to see a doctor. If she could find an antidote, it would be for her.After carefully examining her pulse and looking at her face, Hou Taiyi stroke his beard and said directly in front of them, \u201cMadam is born weak. She is sick and has heart palpitations. If she doesn\u2019t take care of it in time, she may die soon.\u201d\\n\\n BACK\\n \\n \\n NEXT\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

HAHA ok.\\n\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272f\\nTranslated by: Tinker\\nSong Luan\u2019s head felt as if it was severely split by a thunderbolt. The words that hit her head made her unable to recall for a while, and her originally pale face seemed even whiter now.\\nWhat? She\u2019s dying? She lived so humbly and yet she was dying???\\nSong Luan\u2019s heart trembled. She really wanted to fight Zhao Nanyu now.\\nZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was not better than her. The five fingers curled up under the sleeve trembled slightly, and his face was pale. There was no expression on his tight face. A pair of black eyes looked straight at Hou Taiyi. The voice in his throat was very hoarse. He asked, \u201cHou Taiyi, do you have a good prescription for this?\u201d\\nNo, Song Luan was not born with physical deficiency and multiple diseases. She was in good health before she gave birth to little Zhao. She was no different from ordinary people. Although she almost died when she was a child, she was not weak to this extent.\\nIn her final analysis, it had something to do with his poison.\\nZhao Nanyu clasped his hands and clenched his jaw. He didn\u2019t even know about the toxicity of Tianqin or whether there was an antidote. At first, he just simply wanted her to die.\\nZhao Nanyu\u2019s chest was full of dull pain, and the numbness spread through to his limbs. The stubborness in his eyes didn\u2019t waver still\\nHe would never let Song Luan die like this.\\nHou Taiyi sighed for a long time, \u201cMadam has eaten something that she shouldn\u2019t have in the recent years. This pulse looks very dangerous.\u201d After a pause, he said slowly, \u201cBut madam is not incurable. Fortunately, you didn\u2019t eat too much of the dangerous food. Don\u2019t touch them again from now on. Don\u2019t eat cold or raw food. Take extra care of the rest you take. I\u2019ll make some more plans. There\u2019s still room for healing.\u201d\\nOf course, Hou Taiyi did not dare to guarantee that Song Luan would live for a long time.\\nHe\u2019s the head of the hospital, and he had seen no more tricky diseases. Song Luan did not have the general disease, but a result of taking poison, and this caused her palpitations and other minor problems to her organs.\\nHe did not know what kind of poison it was, nor did he ever see such dangerous poison that could slowly destroy a person\u2019s body.\\nBut he also mentioned that the amount she ate was not large, and good thing they found it early, so it wasn\u2019t incurable.\\nHou Taiyi was just used to saying that the illness was more serious, so that the patient would take care of themselves. But he was very curious. Whose venemous heart would poison this woman? Really pitiful.\\nZhao Nanyu opened his mouth, his bloodless lips looked scary. He said softly, \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Hou Taiyi turned his eyes to Song Luan. He heard about this domineering lady. After thinking for a while, he said, \u201cMadam must take medicine well, and the things that hurt her should not be touched. \u201c\\nSong Luan\u2019s ears were buzzing. She couldn\u2019t hear what Hou Taiyi said later.\\nZhao Nanyu answered instead of her, \u201cI will watch her.\u201d\\nThe bitter fruit Zhao Nanyu planted by himself was naturally tasted by him, so he would surely keep her safe.\\nSince Hou Taiyi said that there was a cure, then it could be cured.\\nAfter taking the medicine prescription from the Huo Taiyi, Zhao Nanyu immediately asked the following servants to take the medicine. He took Song Luan back to the room.\\nAfter Song Luan returned to her consciousness, she found that she had returned to her room, and the people in the kitchen had prepared the tonic. Zhao Nanyu brought it to her. \u201cCome, drink the medicine.\u201d\\nSong Luan looked at his gentle appearance of giving medicine to her. She then recalled the memory in her dream. He fed the poison to the original owner himself and forced her to die.\\nSong Luan knew clearly that in the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, all the things that the male lead did to the original owner couldn\u2019t be said to be wrong. His own son was disabled by her, and he had countless green hats on his head. What he did was understandable.\\nBut what\u2019s wrong with her? After an inexplicable sleep, she found she transmigrated and got a pair of rotten cards.\\nShe was afraid of death, and she didn\u2019t want to die. She just lived a short life of more than 20 years, she really didn\u2019t want to die yet.\\nNo one knew if she would die in this world, could she still return to her own world? She dared not gamble.\\nSong Luan\u2019s brain was very confused now. She suddenly cried when she thought about these things, and she lowered her head and silently shed tears.\\nZhao Nanyu sighed, put down the bowl in her hand, and gently wiped the tears for her.\\nHer tears flowed like a river. Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t wipe them clean at all, so he watched her cry quietly.\\nAlthough Song Luan was crying, She also knew she need to drink the medicine. She took the bowl in front of him, lifted her throat and drank all the bitter medicine into her stomach.\\nShe hiccuped as she cried. She seemed to treat Zhao Nanyu as a vent. Her small fists greeted his chest, \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\\nZhao Nanyu let her hit him with her fists and didn\u2019t fight back. Seeing that she drank the medicine while she cried, he teased and laughed. \u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d\\nSong Luan believed his words, and she wiped her eyes with tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear what Hou Taiyi said.\u201d\\n\u201cHe\u2019s scaring you. If you take good care of yourself, nothing will happen.\u201d\\nSong Luan\u2019s anger was all over him, and she began to make unreasonable troubles, \u201cWhy do you coax me? You don\u2019t like me either. I\u2019m dead just as you wish.Didn\u2019t you long for me to die?\u201d\\nThese words were half true and half false.\\nZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t fight back nor scolded her.\\nFor fear that she might lose her temper and hurt herself, he removed all the sharp objects in the room. \u201cNo.\u201d\\nSong Luan\u2019s heart would be much calmer after she vented. She gradually calmed down, and her tears soon stopped, but she still refused to give Zhao Nanyu a good face.\\nZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t force her. He kindly left her alone. Before leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to say, \u201cYou are only weak, not terminally ill. Don\u2019t scare yourself. While I\u2019m here, you will get better.\u201d\\nSong Luan didn\u2019t make a sound. She really didn\u2019t want to talk to him.\\nNo matter how dull she was, she realized that Zhao Nanyu was very different from before, and the contempt and gloom in her eyes gradually disappeared.\\nFor dinner in the evening, little Zhao should have come over, but Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t let the maidservants bring him. He instead let him stay in the front yard.\\nSong Luan was upset when she saw this. Zhao Nanyu held the bowl of pigeon soup for her. She looked at it and pushed it away. She refused to drink it.\\nZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to be angry. If she didn\u2019t eat this, he would give her something else. After a meal, Song Luan didn\u2019t eat much at all. She really had no appetite.\\nShe broke the pot and thought that Zhao Nanyu would be upset, but he didn\u2019t.\\nIn the night, Song Luan came out of the screen after bathing and saw Zhao Nanyu sitting beside the bed. He probably was waiting for her.\\nSong Luan wanted to climb into bed, but was dragged into his arms. She was forced to stick to his chest. He chuckled, and then whispered in her ear, \u201cEven if you want to die, I won\u2019t give you a chance.\u201d\\nSong Luan\u2019s thin body trembled. This is what the male lead would say.\\nShe felt that Zhao Nanyu was agitated when she refused to talk with him in the afternoon and evening.\\nZhao Nanyu hugged her waist, and he closed his eyes and said in a low voice, \u201cI had a sweet dream last night.\u201d\\nHe said to himself, \u201cYou were in it.\u201d\\nSong Luan didn\u2019t expect that she would hear Zhao Nanyu saying this in her lifetime. She admitted that at some point, her heart beat faster than usual.\\nZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t lie. She was indeed in his dream. If Song Luan knew the specific picture in his dream, she would surely scold him as a beast again.\\nZhao Nanyu suddenly pressed her on the bed. With eyes like stars, he only looked at her. Then, he covered her delicate body. His long and delicate fingers wrapped around her hair, but he did not get her response, so he asked again with hoarse voice, \u201cYou are not going to talk to me for a lifetime?\u201d\\nSong Luan looked away, \u201cNo.\u201d\\nShe needed to vent, and Zhao Nanyu, who was the fuse, should naturally become the vent.\\nZhao Nanyu lowered his head and gently kissed her cheek, then breathlessly kissed the person under him before he let go, \u201cStill too idle that you still have time to think.\u201d\\nSong Luan turned her head and was angry to death. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d\\nHe\u2019s like this. She didn\u2019t want to serve him at all!\\nSong Luan didn\u2019t realize that when she was kissed breathlessly, she looked at Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes with a trace of love, but it was not obvious.\\nZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t plan to do anything to her. He just held her to sleep that night, but even if he repented and regretted he fed her the poison, he already had no way back.\\nHe would find all the elixirs in the world for her to keep her alive. He would rise to the top and have enough power to control her life.\\nAfter waking up the next day, Song Luan meditated in bed for a long time.\\nFrom today on, she wanted to follow the words of Taiyi and take medicine well. Wasn\u2019t it just physical deficiency?! Wasn\u2019t it just heart disease? It would be okay.\\nAfter this, she still treated her son just as before, but she obviously did not flatter Zhao Nanyu as much as before.\\nAll her thoughts were written in her face. Within a few days, even the servants knew that the second young master and his wife had a cold war.\\n \\n BACK\\n \\n \\n NEXT\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(drop a comment for any suggestions to improve the site~ ^^)\\n Enjoy this chapter! <3\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fTranslated by: TinkerThe cold war between Song Luan and Zhao Nanyu was completely unilateral. Because she didn\u2019t pay much attention to him, she wouldn\u2019t notice that Zhao Nanyu was still the same as before. He still came back to her house everyday after working in Dali Temple.Song Luan felt that it\u2019s quite good now. Her life was more relaxed than the previous months. She didn\u2019t walk on thin ice nor tremble anymore. Since the body had turned like this, all she could do was take the medicine. As for Zhao Nanyu, how could she like him! She stopped serving him already.However, he was worthy of the title of male lead. He was still powerful. Even though Song Luan had given up holding this unreliable golden thigh, she dared not provoke him too much.When the male lead looked at her smilingly, Song Luan felt tight in her heart. She was sweating at the back of her hand, and all her words were swallowed in her throat.Song Luan originally disliked the bitterness of traditional Chinese medicine and never wanted to drink it well, but this time, she listened to the words of Hou Taiyi.When she drank the medicine, she was more obedient than anything. She didn\u2019t need other people\u2019s urging. She pinched her nose and raised her neck to drink.She wanted to live another two years in such a beautiful world.She didn\u2019t know who told her son about her recent illness. When Zhao Chao taught little Zhao to read poems, he was absent-minded and didn\u2019t write very well.Zhao Chao was not unreasonable either. Little Zhao was obedient and sensible. He was a cute little baby. He also liked this little Zhao. Even if he sometimes makes mistakes or doesn\u2019t study hard, he couldn\u2019t bear to punish him.This time there was no exception in Zhao Chao. He collected the pen and paper for him, held the child on the chair in his arms, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Your mind is not focused on practicing this calligraphy? Are you hungry? or tired?\u201dLittle Zhao was indifferent to strangers, but he was still soft and cuddly in the face of familiar relatives. He hugged Zhao Chao\u2019s neck, and his small face was very frustrated. He said, \u201cMy mother seems to be ill. My father didn\u2019t let me go to see her last night. I was a little worried. \u201dLast night, his father didn\u2019t let him go, and this morning he even forbade him.\\n He listened to his father\u2019s words very much and rarely resisted or objected, but this time he really couldn\u2019t hold back and wanted to see his mother.Zhao Chao was stunned. He didn\u2019t even realize that Song Luan had unconsciously left a very important position in this little kid\u2019s heart.To be honest, he hated Song Luan very much.Zhao Chao was used to wearing mask on his face, so no one could see that his disgust was so deep. He always thought that Song Luan\u2019s life and death were unimportant. It was even better if Song Luan died. She was a plague or a curse from the devil.He was willing to fight when he saw how she treated this 2 year-old child before.\\n But now it seemed that little Zhao liked her very much. In just a few months, the child\u2019s heart was completely turned towards her.If she died like this, he was afraid it would take a long time for little Zhao to recover.Zhao Chao touched his head. \u201cDo you want me take you to see your mother?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Little Zhao laid on his shoulder and nodded vigorously.Zhao Chao thought that Song Luan was conniving. Normally, the medicine of Tianqing in her body was not enough to cause fatality, and the poison of his master was gentler than the medicine he made.If he used his poison, Song Luan would have been dead long ago.He couldn\u2019t bear to see him sad, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take you there.\u201dSong Luan was the second most disliked person in Zhao family, Zhao Chao, who hid his swords in his smile, was not a good person. As the saying goes, he smiles on his face but wants to kill you.She knew that Zhao Chao also hated her very much. In the original book, Zhao Chao was a man who could be ranked as the fourth male lead, and could play a role at a critical moment. The female lead was always liked by many men at the same time.\u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019 was a common book with the usual setting. The little white flower female lead was pitied by all kinds of men because of her weakness. After meeting the female lead twice, Zhao Chao took the initiative to get closer to her.His identity as the fourth male and the second male lead\u2019s cousin meant that he could not get the female lead. Even so, Zhao Chao would play the word \u2018affectionate\u2019 very well, so that the female lead would not marry for life.Song Luan felt that the author\u2019s brain was not very good when she read the book. The men in the book didn\u2019t marry for the sake of the female lead\u2019s life. She thought of abandoning the novel for a time, but she still put up with it.Song Luan was about to drink some medicine when he saw little radish\u2019s head coming in. His eyes were as beautiful as grapes when he saw her. His eyes were full of worries, and he called out to her softly, \u201cMother.\u201dSong Luan put down the bowl in her hand and pinched his cheek lightly. \u201cWhy are you coming here? Don\u2019t you have class today?\u201dLittle Zhao set aside his shyness, and it seemed he was about to cry. The emotion in the child\u2019s eyes was the purest. He looked at her and said, \u201cDad told me that you are ill. I\u2019m a little worried.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart was warm and her chest was blocked. It\u2019s really good to have him. She won\u2019t leave him in the future.Song Luan was an orphan who grew up without both parents. She was alone most of the time. When she heard little Zhao,\u00a0her eyes became red, and she smiled at him. \u201cMother will soon get better.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know how long it would take for her to get well, but the palpitation attack was not easy. The pain was very painful.Little Zhao raised his face and asked, \u201cMother, is the medicine very bitter? Would you like some sugar?\u201dEvery time he had a fever and drank bitter medicine, his father would reward him with two sweets. So, he took out the sweets in his pocket, spread out his little hand, and laid the four sweets wrapped in sugar paper in his palm. \u201cIt won\u2019t be bitter after eating. \u201d\\n This is what he saved. His father gave him very little every time. Zhao Nanyu was afraid that he would have bad teeth.Waves of warm water flowed into Song Luan\u2019s chest and made her feel warm.\\n She couldn\u2019t help kissing him. \u201cYou keep it for yourself. Your mother is not afraid of suffering.\u201dHe was very stubborn, and just wanted to give her the candy, \u201cYou eat.\u201dThe son followed his father\u2019s stubborness. Song Luan had to take the sugar and swallow it. \u201cI\u2019ll take one.\u201dLittle Zhao shook his head and looked at her with large eyes. \u201cNo, it would not be bitter after you eat three.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t help it. She ate the remaining two sweets together from his little palm\u2019s heart. \u201cIs it alright?\u201dLittle Zhao nodded, \u201cMm-hmm, it won\u2019t be bitter.\u201dZhao Chao stood by the door and looked at them silently without disturbing them.The golden sunlight hit her shoulder through the window pane. The woman lowered her head, with her features outstretched. The jasmine color clothes made her look more white.Zhao Chao found that his second sister-in-law\u2019s temperament was better than before, gentle and quiet.Before he came, he thought about whether Song Luan was pretending to be ill. But looking at her pale face. It didn\u2019t look like she was pretending.Last time, he looked at her pulse, her appearance was not as bad as it is today. Average people couldn\u2019t see it. But, he, a doctor could already see the clues.Song Luan\u2019s physical was weak. The body seemed to lost a lot of nutrients. It looked like something was slowly devouring her.Song Luan seemed to notice his eyes. She raised her head, frowned at him, and coughed twice, \u201cThird brother-in-law is also here.\u201dZhao Chao smiled three-times wider, \u201cI brought little Zhao here. \u201d\u201cThank you. \u201d\u201cNo, I see little Zhao is worried about second sister-in-law, so I have to take him to see you. See you\u2019re okay, I\u2019m relieved.\u201dZhao Chao\u2019d mind still didn\u2019t change. It didn\u2019t matter whether Song Luan died or not. It\u2019s better to die. In the Zhao family, who hadn\u2019t she seduced?First, Ayan.Then, her second brother.It\u2019s easier for her to die.Song Luan smirked twice, and said stiffly, \u201cThank you for your concern,\u201dZhao Chao beckoned to little Zhao, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen your mother, it\u2019s time to go back to study and practice calligraphy.\u201dSong Luan was angry as soon as she heard it. The contempt in Zhao Chao\u2019s eyes aroused her anger. She hugged her son and sneered, \u201cHe won\u2019t practice today.\u201d\u201cSecond sister-in-law, this\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, my heart is hurting again.\u201d Song Luan didn\u2019t bother to talk to him, so she covered her chest and started pretending.Little Zhao was not at ease\u2026 Hearing his mother say it hurts, his face turned white. He said to Zhao Chao, \u201cUncle, I want to accompany my mother.\u201dZhao Chao watched her \u2018play\u2019 coldly. It was hard for him to put his emotions on his face and smiled sarcastically. He said, \u201cSecond sister-in-law is really good.\u201dSong Luan ignored him and put her heart into her little \u2018play\u2019.Zhao Chao was so angry that he had no choice but to walk away with big steps.As soon as he left, Song Luan stopped pretending, but her son was obviously frightened by her.Song Luan was both distressed and guilty. He coaxed him softly, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid ah\u2026I\u2019m all right.\u201dHer son wiped away his tears silently, hiccuped and said, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201dHe was afraid that his mother would leave him.Song Luan comforted him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Mother will always be here.\u201dHe cried and fell asleep in her arms.Song Luan placed him on the bed, took off his shoes and covered him with a quilt. She wiped the tears on his face with a handkerchief.In the face of this small face similar to Zhao Nanyu, she sighed and went out the room.\\n A maidservant reported that lady Yang came to visit her.Song Luan remembered her. Yang Ruoyun, the third miss of Yang family, was one of the characters that provoked the original owner.Song Luan thought about it and guessed that at this time, Yang Ruoyun came to stir up her relationship with Zhao Nanyu.After all, everyone in the Zhao\u2019s family could see that they were both in cold war recently.Yang Ruoyun couldn\u2019t let go of such a good chance.

She stayed low-key besides third lady Zhao.Yang Ruoyun\u2019s face was painted with light make-up, and looked beautiful and delicate. She had a gentle smile on the corner of her mouth. Her smile was appropriate. When she came in, she softly cried out to her, \u201cCousin-in-law.\u201dSong Luan knew that Yang Ruoyun is a very intelligent woman. She was able to understand the situation clearly, and had both strategy and courage.She pretended to have a flat response and asked directly, \u201cIs there something wrong that third cousin came over?\u201dYang Ruoyun didn\u2019t seem to see her unhappy face and pretended not to hear the hostility in her words. This cousin was used to have no good face to anyone, and she had seen it for a long time. Besides, she had developed the ability to keep her face unchanged.She smiled and said, \u201cAunt heard that there is conflict between cousin-in-law and cousin. She was worried and had no choice but to let me persuade you.\u201d<blockquote>Remember, Zhao Nanyu is Yang Ruoyun\u2019s cousin</blockquote>Song Luan knew that there were many people in Zhao\u2019s house staring at the two of them. What\u2019s more, Zhao\u2019s house was so big that no information could be hidden in this house.It\u2019s not unusual that their husband and wife had a bad relationship. It was normal. The reason why the third lady was worried was that old lady Zhao was waiting for her granddaughter-in-law to have another baby. The second reason was that the third lady was worried about them. The two of them were willing to share a room after getting along well. She didn\u2019t know how they became cold these days.Song Luan hummed, with a stubborn look on her face, \u201cThere is nothing to persuade.\u201dYang Ruoyun smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with cousin. How can there be an overnight feud between husband and wife. If this time, my cousin was angry at you, serve him softly. Men are very easy to coax.\u201dIt sounded as if Yang Ruoyun was doing this for good. In fact, this sentence stabbed the key point. This second female lead was worthy of her title. Their ability to sow discord was first-class.The original owner was proud. It was impossible to reconcile with Zhao Nanyu, let alone coax the man in a low voice.Song Luan pretended to be angry and gave her a cold look. Her eyes were full of disdain. She raised her chin and deliberately said, \u201cSoft? Why should I be soft with him? Why am I going to coax him? Ridiculous.\u201dYang Ruoyun lowered her eyes and slightly hooked her lips. Then she walked forward two steps, took her wrist affectionately, and comforted her anxiously. \u201cCousin-in-law, step back, even if it\u2019s cousin\u2019s fault, you shouldn\u2019t be angry with him for such a long time. He\u2019s busy enough. I see that he has lost a lot of weight. \u201dSong Luan silently pushed away her hand, looked down at her, and said, \u201cDo you mean that I should just swallow then?\u201d\u201cOf course not, but my cousin-in-law who doesn\u2019t know how to coax people, must have been aggrieved because of cousin. Aunt is worried.\u201dHow nice her words were! At first, they were concerns for her, afraid that she would not live well or suffer losses. Thinking clearly, If these words fell into the original owner\u2019s ears, she would surely explode.Song Luan\u2019s face was taut, and her expression did not soften at all. Her tone was very poor. \u201cAggrieved. Why should I be wronged?\u201d She looked up at Yang Ruoyun with sharp eyes.She pretended to be impatient and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to persuade me anymore. I will do what I want. If you are worried about your cousin\u2019s anger, you can persuade him instead of me. \u201dYang Ruoyun\u2019s expression was aggrieved, and she bit his lips and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because I speak too much. In that case, I won\u2019t bother much.\u201dShe walked out of Song Luan\u2019s yard slowly. Her face was clear and her mouth was slightly hooked. She was very happy.This Song Luan was as boring as ever. However, she thought that Song Luan had changed some days ago, and was pretending in front of others.It\u2019s hard to change her nature.Song Luan had better not reconcile with Zhao Nanyu all her life. She would watch Song Luan put herself on the dead end.Song Luan was not worthy of Zhao Nanyu. Apart from her better appearance, how could she compare her moral character and knowledge?It was also a coincidence that Yang Ruoyun met Zhao Nanyu on the corridor after leaving Huai Shui Residence.When she saw the person she was thinking about, her heart beat faster than usual. She went up with a red face and made a formal ceremony, \u201cCousin. \u201d\u2026Zhao Nanyu expression was faint, \u201cThird cousin.\u201dYang Ruoyun looked at him affectionately, summoned up her courage and said, \u201cHas my cousin just come back? \u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2026.\u201d She suddenly said, \u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence that I just came out from my cousin-in-law\u2019s residence.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t have any patience to deal with her. He was not familiar with this distant cousin, and had not seen her for several times in all. The gentle and sensible girl who was obedient was no different from the ordinary ladies.But when he heard about Song Luan, he immediately became interested and asked with interest, \u201cWhat are you doing with her?\u201dHe remembered that Song Luan had a better relationship with Gu Shuang, but had no similar relationships with other women. It was either quarreling or grabbing each other\u2019s hair. Song Luan never met his distant cousin, how could they still talk?Yang Ruoyun would not miss any chance. She paused before she said, \u201cMy aunt asked me to advise my cousin-in-law.\u201d She frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t blame cousin-in-law, cousin. She\u2019s just not sensible, so she\u2019s a little grumpy.\u201dZhao Nanyu laughed when he heard it, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it? My aunt said that you seem to have quarreled. You haven\u2019t talked well for several days.\u201dZhao Nanyu interrupted her with a cold smile. \u201cNo quarrel, tell my mother not to worry.\u201d After a pause, he continued with a smile,\u201d Your cousin-in-law has a lovely temper. Of course, I won\u2019t blame her.\u201dYang Ruoyun\u2019s brain was confused. This was totally different from what she thought?!How could this happen? Shouldn\u2019t this cousin hate that woman?!She didn\u2019t return to her mind until she realized that she had caught Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sleeve. The man in front of her had a cold and bright eyes.He removed her hand coldly and smiled more horribly than not. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to care for our affairs if you still want to stay in the capital. Otherwise, I can also let someone send you back to Jiangnan.\u201dYang Ruoyun\u2019s eyes were red, and she was quick to respond, and promised: \u201cI was abrupt, please don\u2019t blame cousin.\u201dZhao Nanyu glanced at her, didn\u2019t say more. He turned around and left.Yang Ruoyun was biting her teeth and stomped her foot. She was hated by Zhao Nanyu. She didn\u2019t know when Zhao Nanyu was so tolerant of Song Luan?! Was it because she was beautiful?Meanwhile, Song Luan was in the residence, and didn\u2019t what had happened between Zhao Nanyu and Yang Ruoyun.Little Zhao in the room woke up before long.The child was half-awake and had a hazy face. Song Luan helped him dress and let him wear his shoes. Little Zhao smelt the light fragrance from his mother and stretched out his hands to hug her.Song Luan chuckled and held the little kid in her arms. He wrapped his hands around her neck.As soon as Zhao Nanyu came in, he saw the picture of her coaxing the child. He was stunned. He was not very happy and asked, \u201cWhy is our son here? Shouldn\u2019t he be practicing calligraphy at this time?\u201dSong Luan, who pretended not to hear, turned her back to him and bowed her head to coax the child in his arms.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were dark, and the bright candle light reflected on his white face. He slightly closed his chin, but his expression was not worried.He went to his son, since Song Luan would not speak to him. He asked him, \u201cSpeak.\u201dLittle Zhao looked from her mother\u2019s delicate face to the suddenly appearing father. He said with a low voice, \u201cI asked my uncle to bring me over.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s voice without a hint of emotion, \u201cCome down.\u201dLittle Zhao pinched Song Luan\u2019s collar tightly then slowly loosened it. The child could not resist his father\u2019s authority. He was about to climb down from his mother with his hands and feet when he was suddenly held.Song Luan hugged him and looked up at Zhao Nanyu. Although she didn\u2019t want to talk to him, she was afraid of him.She sniffed. \u201cWhy are you angry at the child? You come at me.\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled, his thumb gently crossed her delicate cheek, and finally fell on her chin, lifting it gently, \u201cCan you hold my anger?\u201dHis tone was very low and cold. Song Luan\u2019s back was cold and her mind was trembling. It wasn\u2019t that she was not scared. It was because the force he used was too strong. Those dark eyes made her shiver.She didn\u2019t open her mouth, because she couldn\u2019t stand Zhao Nanyu\u2019s anger\u2026Little Zhao broke free from Song Luan\u2019s lap, and stood in front of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s and said in a low voice, \u201cFather, it\u2019s my fault. \u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come to disturb my mother.\u201dWhen his father left in the morning, he told him that he was not allowed to let his mother take care of him, but he didn\u2019t hold back. While little Zhao thought about it, his eyes became red, although he didn\u2019t cry loudly, tears still ran down his cheeks.Zhao Nanyu sighed, squatted down and wiped the tears off his cheek gently, \u201cDon\u2019t do it again next time. Don\u2019t ask your mother to hold you since she\u2019s not well these days.\u201dSong Luan did not resist, and shouted at him, \u201cI\u2019d like to! Are you in charge?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes slowly moved to her face, thinking, and asked, \u201cI can\u2019t control you? Hmm?\u201dHe patted his son\u2019s head and called a servant girl to come in. He told the servant girl to carry him back to the front yard.There were only two of them in the bedroom. Song Luan shrank back and closed her mouth after shouting at him impulsively.Zhao Nanyu tolerated her deliberate neglect for so many days, which was the limit. He walked step by step towards the woman who was shrinking in the corner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face was pale and cold as ice. Song Luan shrank towards the corner of the bed. Her body trembled slightly.A few days ago, she thought that she was going to die, and her temper was suddenly stimulated. Every time she woke up these past two days, she felt like she was not beyond cure.Many of the plots in the original book had been changed. The legs of little Zhao did not break, and the female lead did not appear. She did not elope with Huai Jin, and Zhao Wenyan did not fall in love with her. The story progressed differently.Although she knew the plot and the ending, she was still miserable than the others.Song Luan pinched the quilt under her body. She was bullied. Zhao Nanyu was a little bit fierce. She was afraid from the bottom of her heart.Zhao Nanyu patted the head of the bed and whispered, \u201cCome here.\u201dThe soft voice that reached Song Luan\u2019s ears was not the same at all. Her scalp was numb and her body was tight. She shook her head desperately.She was not a fool. Did he just ask her to go there? His face clearly says it all\u2013\u2018I will not give you good fruit to eat!\u2019Zhao Nanyu tilted his head and smiled. His pure and clear smile shook her spirits for a while. His appearance was really excellent, not only could be described as handsome, but also breathtaking and beautiful. He had delicate features with no flaws. When he smiles, his gentle features were more vivid.Song Luan\u2019s cheeks felt it was scolded with hot water, and the heat spread to her ear tips.She lowered her head, took two deep breaths, and stopped looking at Zhao Nanyu.\u201cIgnoring me?\u201d Zhao Nanyu also saw that Song Luan\u2019s attitude towards him had changed obviously after they came back from Hou Taiyi\u2019s hospital. She had become more courageous and bold, with her little anger.Song Luan clenched her teeth and said nothing.Zhao Nanyu smiled angrily, with a smile on his eyebrows. He grabbed her directly from the corner by the wrist, and kissed her carefully.Song Luan was bewildered and confusedIn fact, she was also very smart. She was not blind. Why couldn\u2019t she see that Zhao Nanyu liked her a little? But his like was still too trivial.Relying on this, she probed Zhao Nanyu\u2019s bottom line and deliberately ignored him for these past few days.In fact, Song Luan thought that this man was good at other places except for his black belly and cold heart.\u00a0But she couldn\u2019t accept being trapped in the backyard all her life, and the fate of her life being controlled by him.Song Luan couldn\u2019t break fee. Her face was rosy. She couldn\u2019t breathe when he kissed her. Her body was soft. Her lips were bitten. She hissed, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t kiss, it\u2019s painful\u2026\u201d\u201cIt hurts, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Although he said sorry, his movements were still indifferent.His slightly cool fingers slowly climbed from her back to her spine. Her clothes slipped unconsciously, and Zhao Nanyu became stiffer.Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand his offensive attack, so she tried to run back. Of course, she couldn\u2019t escape and was quickly caught back.Zhao Nanyu chuckled and whispered in her ear, \u201cIt seems that you are very happy ignoring me these two days?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were bright and scorched, as if he was thinking of something. Song Luan\u2019s scalp numbed as he stared at her. She couldn\u2019t resist his questioning, her five fingers held his back tightly, and pinched it, \u201cI\u2019m dying, and you bully me!\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were covered with thin blood threads, and his momentum was sharp. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dSong Luan pushed him away, hugged the quilt tightly as she breathed heavily. Her hair was soaked with sweat. She didn\u2019t have any strength, \u201cHou Taiyi said that day that it was because I ate something I shouldn\u2019t have, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what I ate? I didn\u2019t know\u2026.I didn\u2019t think anyone would want to hurt me.\u201dZhao Nanyu stopped for a moment and lowered his eyes. Holding her face, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m not good, I didn\u2019t protect you.\u201dZhao Nanyu figured out why she was so cold these days. Maybe she blamed him for not protecting her. This misunderstanding was better than her knowing that the person who poisoned her was him.Bah! Obviously it\u2019s your poison. You still don\u2019t admit. I\u2019m pretending not to know here.Song Luan closed her eyes and said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t live long, you can find another one. I think your cousin Yang Ruoyun likes you very much. If you like her and want to marry her, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201dYang Ruoyun, in any case, the female character who almost married this male lead.\u00a0The gentle and atmospheric appearance was what this man liked.If he had not just met Yang Ruoyun on the way, Zhao Nanyu would hardly remember what she looked like. He rubbed his eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201dSong Luan was surprised. He denied it directly.Zhao Nanyu pulled down the quilt that covered her head.He asked, \u201cWhat did she come here to tell you today?\u201dSong Luan thought about it and decided to go ahead and say, \u201cShe advised me to coax you, to be soft to you and not to lose my temper with you.\u201dLook, what a good female character.It didn\u2019t matter if the female lead didn\u2019t show up! At least, there\u2019s this female character.It was a pity that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to understand the meaning of her words, and frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t let her in next time. \u201dHe didn\u2019t know what they will say to Song Luan. These irrelevant people were really annoying.I wish they could all disappear.Until today, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s intention to kill Huai Jin had not weakened at all. He had just been patient.He wanted to remove all the men who have had unclear connection with her before.Even thinking that Song Luan might have liked any of them, he couldn\u2019t bear the feeling of jealousy rising up his heart.\u201cShe\u2019s your cousin. You don\u2019t give me this face. I\u2019m afraid people will say I don\u2019t understand etiquette and I\u2019m arrogant.\u201d\u201cNo one dares to say that to you.\u201dSong Luan curled up and was tired of saying so much today. She was very tired. But, she was tossed by him again. She was fighting with her lower and upper eyelids. \u201cI want to go to sleep.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t let her go. He bent her legs on her waist and drew close to her ear. He breathed softly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s still too early.\u201dThe hibiscus tent was warm, and the low sobbing sound in the room was ambiguous. The sound didn\u2019t come down until midnight.Song Luan\u2019s consciousness was dim. She was crying and felt she would almost die. She also realized that the man seemed angry, but she didn\u2019t know what she said that touched his scale that would result to this cruel punishment.Zhao Nanyu chuckled and said in a low and hoarse voice, \u201cYou can easily push me to others\u2026then it\u2019s not true when you said you like me before?\u201dOf course it is false. You still need to ask?After that day, Zhao Nanyu was calm and quiet. Song Luan was willing to take care of him, although she was not as warm as before.Zhao Nanyu had no shortage of soups and medicines. Song Luan\u2019s complexion became a little better. The maintenance of the body was a long-term thing, even if Song Luan was in a hurry, she had no choice but to take this step by step.Zhao Nanyu seemed to be afraid that she would not take the medicine well. He would personally watch her every morning and evening as she drink all the medicine in the bowl.After drinking the medicine for a month, Song Luan\u2019s state of mind was so good that she would occasionally lose her temper, but Zhao Nanyu only watched her closely, even if she vented on him.Third lady Zhao looked at the cold and lukewarm appearance of the two people. She was worried and couldn\u2019t help it. They were still like that after more than a month.Yang Ruoyun was the happiest of all the people in the house. She would like them to stay like that for the rest of their lives. Song Luan had been quarreling with Zhao Nanyu for a long time every time she had a chance.Yang Ruoyun won\u2019t give up easily, even if she was scolded or threatened by her cousin.If Song Luan was not worthy of him. Only she (YR) was worthy of her cousin.Zhao Nanyu never paid attention to this unimportant cousin from the beginning to the end, and even forgot to clean her up.He\u2019d been checking Huai Jin these days. Huai Jin must had forgotten he was kicked out harshly, because he was not afraid squatting and wandering outside the backyard fence these two days. He should be looking for an opportunity to come in and chat with Song Luan. Zhao Nanyu wouldn\u2019t let him in.When investigating Huai Jin, Zhao Nanyu also learned a very interesting thing. Song Luan seemed to hide most of her gold, silver, jewelry and money to Huai Jin.Zhao Nanyu thought about it a little, and figured out why she hid it there. Ten percent of it was for the purpose of leaving in the future.If she leaves openly or secretly, she could just take the treasure and go. This method was convenient and easy to use.Midsummer was approaching, and the days were becoming more and more lively.When the emperor\u2019s birthday was celebrated in the palace, any official invited to celebrate in the palace could bring a family member with him.Zhao Nanyu naturally wanted to take Song Luan with him, but she was very reluctant to go.This time, there was a detailed description in the original book of entering the palace.The original owner drank a lot of wine, so she secretly slipped out of the hall to cool her face.A group of people went to the pond to admire the lotus.\u00a0The original owner had offended many people earlier, and someone placed the medicine into her wine glass. Although it didn\u2019t kill her, it also made her suffer a lot.When the original owner came to the pond, her abdomen suddenly felt pain. Wave after wave of pains, she gradually understood what was going on. She held on to the railing.When her painful face was white and speechless, He Run came out, lifted and carried her regardless of other people\u2019s eyes.The male lead then came, looking at her lying in He Run\u2019s arms with a cold face, while she painfully clutched her stomach as she screamed in pain. He didn\u2019t take her from He Run\u2019s arms, but went to call the doctor for her.Song Luan didn\u2019t know who want to hurt her. She really didn\u2019t want to feel the pain.But it was no use that she didn\u2019t want to go, Zhao Nanyu only family member was her.On the day of departure, Song Luan got on the carriage and entered the palace with Zhao Nanyu.She thought in silence that she won\u2019t drink the wine that had been drugged.Zhao Nanyu smiled at her sincerely and squeezed her face. \u201cWell, it looks nice.\u201dHe meant that she looked a lot better, unlike the previous days that looked like as if she would die any minute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll be uploading the two chapters tomorrow! ~o~ <3 Enjoy!\u272f\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4*\u00a8`*\u2022\u273f \u273f\u2022*`\u00a8*`\u2022.\u00b8\u272fTranslated by: TinkerThe banquet in the palace was very important. It was not only Zhao Nanyu who went in Zhao\u2019s family, but also everyone who had official positions in the palace had to go. No one knew who sent out the news that the emperor wanted to take advantage of this birthday to point out marriage for several unmarried princes.Several princes who were most likely to win the throne of the East Palace were among them.As soon as the news came out, many high-ranking women who had not yet been married in the capital were moved by the news. The status of a prince was noble. If their family could marry the royal family, of course, it would be a great good thing.There was only one girl in the second room of the Zhao family. She was not very healthy and often gets sick. So she spent most of these years outside the villa cultivating. In the past two years, she gradually recovered and returned to the capital. The younger sister just arrived this year. The second wife finally persuaded the second master to take her with her.The two carriages of the Zhao family were parked in front of the door. Song Luan saw this little sister who almost never showed up before she got on the carriage. Zhao Min had a beautiful appearance, and a quiet temperament.Zhao Min also saw her. She paid her respects and did a greeting ceremony. The tone was distance and alienated, \u201cSecond sister-in-law.\u201dZhao Min was wearing a very festive dress today. She was pretty and nimble with her red skirt, delicate skin, and beautiful features. She had an excellent jade pendant on her wrist.Song Luan gave her a friendly smile, \u201cFifth Younger Sister\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to care much about this sister. After glancing and nodding, and then said his greetings. He gently clasped Song Luan\u2019s five fingers, \u201cIt\u2019s late. Let\u2019s go. \u201dSong Luan followed him to the carriage. Zhao\u2019s house was not far from the palace gate. There were so many officials and family members entering the palace today, so for a while, the gate of the palace was blocked. The carriages parked outside looked like a long dragon.Song Luan couldn\u2019t hold back her curiosity. She opened the window, stretched out her head and looked out. She found that the line was extremely long. She estimated that they had to wait long for their turn. She drew back her face and sat in her position in a proper manner.In fact, the carriage was actually not big, it was only enough to accommodate the two of them. Song Luan was so bored that she had no choice but to talk to Zhao Nanyu. She asked, \u201cHow can Erbo bring Min Hui\u2019s sister into the palace today? Does he also want Min Hui\u2019s sister to show her face in the emperor to get married with the prince?\u201dZhao Nanyu grasped her cool hand, and casually said, \u201cSeveral princes haven\u2019t had any imperial concubine yet. It\u2019s not surprising that the second uncle wants to fight for opportunities for this fifth younger sister.\u201dHe took a deep look at Song Luan and held her palm harder. There were many people in the world who were obsessed with power, even Song Luan was included. He remembered that she liked the power status of gold, silver, jewelry, and the feeling of being held high.Song Luan didn\u2019t know that the man thought of her past again. She nodded, \u201cI understand, people would climb up high if they had the chance.\u201dZhao Nanyu sighed, \u201cYes.\u201dNow that she liked those, he would give them all to her, so that she would not have a chance to escape.Absolute power means no one can\u2019t resist.Most of the information about the emperor\u2019s selection of imperial concubines for his sons came from the palace. It was certain that the emperor deliberately let the information spread among the people. Since ancient times, the princes\u2019 marriage had never been a matter of mutual love, but a game between all forces. Today\u2019s agenda was suspicious. The candidates must have already been decided to balance the strength of all parties.After waiting for about half an hour, the carriage finally entered the palace. After getting off the carriage and walking to the front of the main hall, Zhao Nanyu met some acquaintances.The person who came was a handsome man. He had on a shallow smile on his lips that look like the spring breeze in the rain. The man was dressed in a dark robe and wore a delicate white jade crown on his head. He even looked good from a distance.\u201cAh Yu, it\u2019s a coincidence that we met before entering the hall.\u201dZhao Nanyu arched his hand and said, \u201cSixth Royal Highness.\u201dSong Luan suddenly realized that her intuition was right. Just now, seeing the smile on his face, she felt it was fake. It turned out that he was the second biggest winner of the book, the sixth prince, who later became the new emperor.It\u2019s not unreasonable that the sixth prince and Zhao Nanyu had a good relationship. The ruthless style of these two men were too similar. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s means were above the sixth prince, and the ruthlessness of the sixth prince was beyond anyone\u2019s reach.The girl who had saved his life treated him wholeheartedly, but in the end, she also said to be destroyed.Before the sixth prince ascended the throne, he seemed to be a very easy-going young man, smiling like a spring breeze. But after he became king, he changed his face very quickly. He made a drastic change and killed many people.The eyes of the sixth prince seemed to linger on Song Luan\u2019s face for a moment as he smiled, \u201cAh Yu, is this your wife? This is the first time I\u2019ve seen you together.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d Song Luan\u2019s white face was soon turned red by the wind, and Zhao Nanyu stood in front of her to block most of the wind.After a pause, he said, \u201cYour Highness, let\u2019s go in and talk.\u201dSixth prince raised his eyebrow. He did not expect that his best friend would be so distressed and concerned for his wife. She had made a great noise last year. Who in this place not know that the Song family\u2019s third lady had a family affair? She did not lack troubles these past few years.He thought that Ah Yu was disgusted with this capable lady, so he never mentioned this wife in front of him. Now it seems that those rumors were false.Ah Yu clearly liked this third lady of the Song family.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go in and talk.\u201dOnce in the palace, Song Luan was frightened by the battle inside. Even if it was a happy event, the atmosphere was solemn.The emperor\u2019s birthday was not meant to play.The only person she knew in the whole palace was Zhao Nanyu, who she had to rely on. Zhao Nanyu seemed to realize her tension and uneasiness, so he held her hand tightly and never let go. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just follow me.\u201dSong Luan, of course, followed him.First, she didn\u2019t want to drink the wine that had been drugged. Second, she couldn\u2019t let Zhao Nanyu see the picture of He Run holding her.In fact, at the beginning, Song Luan was worried about whether she would suffer retribution if she changed the plot of the original book without permission?Gradually, she found that the fate of others had been changed, and she had not been punished, so she gradually let go of this thought.When everyone was seated, the emperor came.Song Luan listened to the eunuch\u2019s high pitched voice and felt her ears hurt. Although the emperor was not young, and his body was weak. The majesty of the emperor made others dared not look straight.The emperor sat in a high position and rarely smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be restrained tonight.\u201dAlthough he had said this, his ministers did not dare to take it seriously.The emperor seemed to be in a good mood today. His face was plain, and the smile on his face didn\u2019t go down tonight.Song Luan only looked at the emperor carefully at the beginning, and for the rest of the time, she only lowered her head and ate the food in her bowl. She and Zhao Nanyu sat in the back position. The food at each table was just enough.The food in the imperial palace was better than the food outside. It looked more appetizing. Song Luan put some pieces of pineapple crisps on her plate.She tasted them. They were not sweet and not greasy. They tasted very good.She couldn\u2019t help eating them one by one. She ate all of them in a short time. Unfortunately, there was only a small plate for each person, so there was nothing left.Song Luan\u2019s mouth dried after eating too much, but she didn\u2019t dare to drink water at all.Tonight, she decided not to drink anything.She was already hungry. What she had just eaten was not enough for her stomach. She licked her lips, and wanted to eat more.Zhao Nanyu silently pushed the pineapple cake in front of him to her, \u201cEat it.\u201dSong Luan was afraid that the more she ate, the more thirsty she would be, but she couldn\u2019t resist her greediness, so she ate two more pieces. Zhao Nanyu observed carefully and was afraid that she was thirsty so he poured a glass of water for her and pushed it to her, \u201cDrink water.\u201dSong Luan was like a frightened bird. She quickly refused, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not thirsty.\u201dAfter swallowing, her thirstiness was relieved.The emperor in the throne did not know how to laugh. He looked down softly at the people sitting down. The emperor suddenly raised his glass and said slowly, \u201cLet\u2019s drink together, everyone.\u201dAll the people stood up, and Song Luan hurriedly got up. She had to take up her glass and watched all the people drink the wine. She bit the glass, and her lips only lingered at the mouth of the glass. She didn\u2019t drink a drop of wine.In such a big occasion, no one should pay attention whether she had drunk this glass of wine except those who want to harm her with medicine.Sure enough, no one looked at her. Song Luan took a sigh of relief and sat down slowly. At this time, she found her sister, Song Yu, sitting opposite her.Song Yu also noticed her eyes and smiled at her.Song Luan gave her a fake smile. Song Yu sat beside Song Heqing.There were many girls in the Song family. This sister was very skilled, making her brother bring her to the palace instead of the other sisters. She must be one of the many women who wanted to be a princess.It was difficult for Song Yu to marry the prince. The Song family was also a high gate, but it\u2019s far different from the royal family.When Zhao Nanyu saw that the wine in front of her did not move, he said with a smile, \u201cThis is the fruit wine provided by Gongli special. It\u2019s very delicious. I remember that you like to drink fruit wine very much. Why don\u2019t you drink it?\u201dShe made a random excuse, \u201cI\u2019m afraid to make a fool of myself.\u201dZhao Nanyu knew that Song Luan likes to drink, but the amount of wine was not good. If she drank a little, she would be drunk.\u201cDon\u2019t drink in the palace. I\u2019ll ask someone to take some back to the palace later.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe emperor was talking with his sons. They looked very harmonious.At the end of the dinner party, the people accompanied the emperor to the imperial garden to see the fireworks.Finally, the emperor announced several edicts in succession.It\u2019s all about marriage. There were also six of the princes.Most people didn\u2019t expect that the emperor had already selected people in advance and seemed to be waiting for today\u2019s announcement.The birth mother of the sixth prince was poor and died early. His influence among these princes seemed to be the weakest at present, but the Emperor gave him the legitimate daughter of the prominent Xuanguo family.Xuanguofu had been honored for many years and held military power. Xuan Zhengqing was the most beloved daughter in the family. The old lady and her parents love her the most.When the imperial edict came down, even if Xuan Zhengqing had no intention to marry sixth prince, she had to kneel down to thank him.Looking at the smile in the eyes of sixth prince, Song Luan could not see whether he was satisfied with the marriage at all. It stands to reason that the Xuanguo family could increase his power, and this was not unreasonable.But Song Luan thought of the plot in the original book. It was written that after the new emperor ascended the throne, a luxurious palace was built in the rear area. It was said that a woman was imprisoned in the palace. For many years, no one had seen how the woman looked like, but everyone guessed that it must be her beautiful face that made the emperor built a palace for her.She didn\u2019t think Xuan Zhengqing was that woman.The emperor seemed tired. He told everyone to go to the imperial garden to see the fireworks when the time came, and then he\u00a0left the main hall after giving orders.The invisible pressure on Song Luan\u2019s head suddenly disappeared, and she felt more comfortable.Song Yu suddenly got up and walked towards her. She had a pleasant smile on her face. \u201cSister, the palace is too stuffy. Can you accompany me out to cool in the wind?\u201dSong Luan refused without thinking. She never left Zhao Nanyu for a step. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s face was thin, and her face turned red after she refused. She felt so pitiful after being seen by others. She thought that her unreasonable elder sister was bullying her. \u201cElder sister, I\u2019m really scared to go by myself. Can\u2019t you go with me?\u201dSong Luan shook her head and didn\u2019t give her any face. She suddenly took Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand, \u201cAh Yu also drank too much. I have to accompany him. \u201dAfter being rejected twice, Song Yu didn\u2019t have the courage to speak for the third time. She bit her teeth and went back to her place.As soon as she left, Song Luan let go of the man\u2019s arms.Many people in the main hall have gone out, either to blow air or to the imperial garden to wait in advance.Zhao Nanyu asked her, \u201cAre you full?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m full. \u201dHer biggest problem now was thirst, but she still had to keep holding until she leaves the palace before she could touch any water.Zhao Nanyu nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll show you around the palace. \u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan also wanted to see what the ancient imperial palace was like, and whether it was really as gorgeous as described in historical books.The palace was surrounded with red lanterns.\u00a0It was lofty and exquisitely carved.After passing two paths, they arrived at the back hall. Zhao Nanyu met sixth prince by the lake.This time, he was accompanied by a little eunuch. After a careful look, the little eunuch looked very beautiful. He was not like a boy.Song Luan could see that the little eunuch was a girl almost at a glance, mostly pretending to be the eunuch to follow sixth prince.There were many people beside the pavilion by the lake. It seems that the sixth prince was not prepared for her. In front of her and Zhao Nanyu, he squeezed the little eunuch\u2019s face and made her laugh.Song Luan did not dare or want to see it. The more she knew, the faster she would die. Zhao Nanyu was his best friend, but she was nothing.Sixth prince and Zhao Nanyu had something to talk about. Sixth prince bent a pair of peach blossom eyes, and looked at her deeply, \u201cMiss Song, are you free?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cA Yun is timid. It\u2019s her first time around the palace, can you take her around?\u201d The sixth prince gave the little eunuch\u2019s hand directly to her, and said to the little girl gently, \u201cFollow this sister.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan was so depressed. It was also her first time to enter the palace. But these two men want to talk alone, she couldn\u2019t help it.She took the little girl\u2019s hand and led her not far away. Song Luan did not dare to stay too far away from them. She could still see their position when she looked up.The little girl beside her also stayed in peace. Song Luan said, \u201cShall we sit and watch the fish?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe two women stared at the carp in the lake, and soon after they were busy. It was Song Yu and her friends who also came.\u201cSister, you are here.\u201dSong Luan leaned against the railing and looked at the man in the pavilion who was still talking with the sixth prince. Her uneasy heart fell down a little. She said, \u201cI am watching the fish.\u201d\u201cDoes the fish look good?\u201dIt\u2019s much better than you.Song Luan was born to hate Song Yu, and her disgust was overwhelming. She turned around impatiently and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not good, so I\u2019m leaving. Take your time if you like.\u201dFortunately, the original owner never had a good face for Song Yu, so it\u2019s not surprising that she said these words to Song Yu.Song Luan was about to leave when a sharp stabbing pain came from her lower abdomen. Her legs immediately softened and she almost fell to the ground in pain. Fortunately, A Yun on her side helped her.The little girl\u2019s voice was sweet, and was worried, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dThe pain this time was different from that of the last time. The feeling in the abdomen was the same as being beaten with heavy boxing. The flesh and blood were stirred in the belly. Her forehead was cold and sweaty. She opened her mouth, but she couldn\u2019t say anything. \u201cMy stomach hurts so much.\u201dThis kind of pain did not give her any chance to breathe. Every minute was torture. The original ruddy lips was now extremely pale. Song Luan pinched A Yun\u2019s wrist and tightened her teeth to prevent her from calling out.A Yun was obviously scared. She wanted to call people, but she couldn\u2019t let her go. She was about to cry.Song Luan\u2019s face was white and her consciousness was still clear. She gasped heavily, and her lower lip that she bitten had already bled.At this time, a man suddenly appeared in the crowd. He Run looked worried. He pushed away A Yun and picked up Song Luan. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?! What\u2019s going on?\u201dSong Luan wished that her eyes would pass out in the dark, and break away from He Run. However, she did not have the strength to push him.All of a sudden, a gust of wind swept through her ears.Zhao Nanyu finally appeared and ran from the pavilion in a hurry. He stared at He Run coldly. His eyes seemed to be poison. He wished He Run\u2019s hands on her were chopped.Zhao Nanyu decisively grabbed Song Luan. The woman in his arms looked as if she had already lose all the blood. Her hair was soaked by cold sweat.But knowing Zhao Nanyu was with him, Song Luan relaxed. She placed her arms around his waist, and buried her face in his chest. She was quite aggrieved, \u201cIt hurts.\u201dIt really hurts. She\u00a0still felt the pain in her body clearly.It was more than a hundred times more painful than her monthly period.She obviously didn\u2019t touch a drop of water, so why was she stuck in this scene!? Why did He Run still appeared?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her lips whispered in low tones as she grasped his clothes tightly without letting go. Tears ran down her face, and it didn\u2019t stop pouring from her eyes.Zhao Nanyu looked at her dry lips and was about to get up and pour a glass of water for her, but the person on the bed trembled and held out their fingers. She had to hold on the corner of his clothes as she didn\u2019t have any strength.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201dThis kind of dull pain was really too hard to endure. It made people more and more conscious.Although Song Luan feared her impending death at what Zhao Nanyu would do towards her in the future, but he was the only one in the Imperial Palace who could bring her a sense of security. Song Luan\u2019s eyes were glistening with tears. They were as red as the rabbit\u2019s. They were pitiful.Zhao Nanyu sat back and took her hand and whispered, \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t go.\u201d His back was tight, his eyes were bloodshot, and his face was cold. He turned his head and said earnestly to the sixth prince behind him, \u201cExcuse me, sixth highness, please ask a doctor for me.\u201dAfter a pause, he added two more words, \u201cAs soon as possible.\u201dTonight, sixth prince saw how Zhao Nanyu treated Song Luan.Now, the sixth prince ordered people to go to the Taiji hospital and ask the Tai doctor to come over.Song Yu stood outside and watched. She was so nervous that she kept wringing her handkerchief. Her face was ugly and white.Song Yu had to admit that there was poison in the wine glass in front of Song Luan\u2019s table.She looked for that kind of medicine so hard before she attended the birthday party in the palace. The medicine had no harm other than stomachache. Although she hated this elder sister, Song Luan was after all, still her sister. She dared not kill her.But tonight, she knew that Song Luan didn\u2019t even drink since she stared at her all night. She never touched the glass from the beginning to the end!How could Song Luan get poisoned!? Song Yu even began to doubt that maybe Song Luan had seen through her. However, Song Luan\u2019s speechless appearance did not look like it was pretend. For a while, Song Yu was confused. She didn\u2019t know what was going on.Tai doctor was quickly invited from the Taiji hospital. Since the sixth prince personally sent the message, the doctor did not dare to delay, so he hurried to check her pulse. After careful diagnosis, he took a breath of relief and turned to let the apprentice behind him go to Taiji hospital to get the antidote.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was heavy, the lines of his chin were cold and hard, and there was a murky breath coming from him. He said in a hoarse voice, \u201cTaiyi, what\u2019s wrong with my wife?\u201dHe clenched his five fingers, and it turned white. At that moment, he almost thought Song Luan was going to die.The doctor said slowly, \u201cMadam ate Qingluo by mistake, and this caused her stomach to hurt. After taking the antidote, she will be okay.\u201d\u201cQingluo?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of poison from the south of Xinjiang. It\u2019s not vicious either. It won\u2019t take peoples\u2019 lives after taking it. It will only hurt them.\u201dThe sixth prince responded first, and waved his hand, \u201cGo and find out where the poison came from.\u201dSong Yu\u2019s heart suddenly jumped. She pride herself on her calm temperament and was not afraid of being checked. The wine glass passed so many people, so they wouldn\u2019t find that it was her. Song Yu forced herself to relax gradually.There was a ready-made antidote in the hospital. The little apprentice quickly sent it to her. Zhao Nanyu helped Song Luan up, gently feeding the antidote into her stomach, and carefully wiped her lips.Song Luan\u2019s back was already wet. Because of the pain, she had been biting her lips, and tiny wounds began to appear.\u201cDon\u2019t bite yourself.\u201d Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t see it.Song Luan buried herself in his chest and sobbed. Zhao Nanyu took out his coat to wipe the sweat off her face. He reached his finger to her lips. \u201cBite me.\u201dSong Luan was not polite to him either. She opened his mouth and bit him. She immediately left two wounds.Fortunately, the antidote soon worked, and the pain in the lower abdomen gradually eased. Slowly, the surging pain disappeared, and Song Luan loosened her teeth.She felt she had just been fished out of the water, and was embarrassed.Even though Song Luan was poisoned, it didn\u2019t turn into a big commotion. Today was a great day, no one would poke this kind of thing in front of the emperor and make him unhappy.***Therefore, only a few people on the lakeside at that time knew.Soon, the people that sixth prince ordered also came back, along with the wine cup on the table of Song Luan,\u201dYour highness, the wine glass was poisoned.\u201d\u201cI see. Step back.\u201dIt seems that Zhao Nanyu was not surprised to hear this sentence. He had seen a lot of dirty things in the palace. He pulled up a smile of ridicule.The person poisoned the cup directly. It could be seen that this person\u2019s means and mind were very common.It\u2019s too easy to find out who poisoned this.Song Luan had no strength in all her limbs. She didn\u2019t hear the report because she was too tired. She laid in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arms and slept quietly.Zhao Nanyu covered the quilt for her, stood up, and said to sixth prince, \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so polite.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes swept over Song Yu\u2019s body intentionally. He casually rubbed his fingers, and said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time. The emperor will come to the imperial garden.\u201dThe sixth prince said, \u201cYou stay and take good care of her. Naturally, I will speak for you for father\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cThank you, your highness.\u201dSixth prince left.Naturally, some people who stayed also left and didn\u2019t continue to stay any longer.But the little eunuch beside the sixth prince was not willing to leave. She was still too young and was scared by Song Luan\u2019s appearance. Her eyes were red and she grabbed sixth prince\u2019s clothes. \u201cHow is she? Is she alright?\u201dSixth prince patted her head, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much. It will be fine.\u201d Then he took her hand, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see fireworks? Come on, I\u2019ll take you there.\u201dThe little girl was coaxed by him around two or three times.Almost everyone left, and the palace soon became quiet. Zhao Nanyu watched over Song Luan\u2019s bedside, and his thumb lingered on her pale face.Song Luan was dizzy. Her body seemed to float and sank in the air. Her dreams were always strange. There were many strange pictures drilling into her mind.Zhao Nanyu looked down and saw that she was slightly frowning. Her heart\u2019s palpitation was smooth, but her breathing was weak and her lips were still pale.Zhao Nanyu found new clothes for her, took off the wet clothes which had been wet by her sweat, and helped her changed.Song Luan couldn\u2019t settle down in her dreams. There was a voice in her ear all the time. It was low and hoarse. She couldn\u2019t sleep comfortably because of the noise.Zhao Nanyu caressed her face carefully and intimately, and said, \u201cClearly you were very careful. How could it be that something happened? I can\u2019t let you out of my sight for a moment.\u201d\u201cIt seems that you will have to stay at home in the future, so you won\u2019t suffer so much. It must be very painful just now. I feel distressed when I look at it.\u201dHe kissed her on the forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t make you suffer in vain.\u201dSong Luan woke up to his voice, slowly opened her eyes, and saw the man beside her.She recovered some strength after sleeping, so she opened her mouth and asked, \u201cWhat have you found out?\u201dMore than anyone else, she wanted to know what was going on. It was written in the book that the drink of the original owner was poisoned, but she didn\u2019t touch the drink. Why would she be poisoned?The strangest thing was that Song Luan didn\u2019t see He Run in the palace, why did he suddenly appear in the palace again? She was so careful to avoid the plot of the original book. Why did it happen at last?\u201cPoison was left in your wine glass.\u201d Zhao Nanyu did not intend to hide it from her.In an instant, the little blood on Song Luan\u2019s little face faded away. She looked pale and scared. Her body was still soft. She could only sit on him.Song Luan did not give up and asked, \u201cIs there anything in the food?\u201dZhao Nanyu shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the food.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart was cold. She didn\u2019t touch the wine. She ate pineapple cake during the banquet, but Zhao Nanyu also ate it.She had a bold guess in her heart. What happened before was strung into a line in her mind. She showed her weakness and flattered him. Zhao Nanyu still gave her the poison. She could not avoid Huai Jin and He Run, because Zhao Nanyu still thought that she had something with them.She was cautious, but still couldn\u2019t escape the plot. Indeed, she tried hard to avoid the path the original owner took in the book, but the result hadn\u2019t changed.That is to say, some plots of the book had changed because she was a transmigrator, but her ending would not change. There were always other reasons that will lead to the end of the original book.The future of everyone else in the book could changed, only she, who was the transmigrator, couldn\u2019t changed.It didn\u2019t matter if her character was broken. The fate line would still be pulled back by an invisible hand.Song Luan thought it was more and more like this. Her heart sank continuously. She remembered clearly the ending of the original owner. She was stabbed after the poison entered the bone marrow, and then burned alive in a fire.Song Luan\u2019s eyes became extremely complicated when she looked at Zhao Nanyu. Now Zhao Nanyu liked her more or less. Since he liked her, he wouldn\u2019t kill her, would he?Would he still want to stab her to death?Song Luan didn\u2019t believe it. She forced herself not to think. Maybe today\u2019s event was just a coincidence.Song Luan didn\u2019t know yet if there were any consequences for her character collapse, but if she went along with the original character of Song Luan, her body would be much unhealthier than it was now. The broken spur would gradually erode her vitality, which was why her heart suddenly ache before the first days she transmigrated.Even if she was poisoned by tianqin, it was far from the time when the poison was going to happen.Seeing that her face was ugly, Zhao Nanyu asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Scared?\u201dSong Luan wriggled her lips and said, \u201cNo.\u201dZhao Nanyu wanted to laugh, but he only showed a smile. He hugged\u00a0Song Luan tightly. Even though she said she was not afraid, he could feel her trembling with fear. \u201cDo you want to know who did it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d She forced back her tears and asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201dIn \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, it was not written who poisoned her during the banquet, it only showed that the original owner lost a big face to the male lead in this banquet, and the hat on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s head became greener.\u201cYour sister, Song Yu.\u201d\u201cAh? How could it be her?\u201d Song Luan was shocked. The younger sister was usually timid and submissive. She would play with anyone and would get along well. She had no idea.She looked ordinary.How could she be so cruel that she dared to attack her own older sister?Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t understand the twists and turns between girls, but at a glance, she could see that Song Yu didn\u2019t like her, and her means were too childish, so the people that sixth prince ordered were able to find the poison so easily.The reason why he didn\u2019t say it in front of everyone was that he wanted to wait for Song Luan to wake up and ask her what she wanted to do.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u00a0Do you want to destroy her reputation? Or something else?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t think about these things at the moment, and she didn\u2019t get Song Yu\u2019s intentions, but if she told Zhao Nanyu that she didn\u2019t care, it seemed that it was too white lotus, so she said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded. \u201cOkay, let me do it.\u201dHis means, needless to say, would not make people feel better.Song Luan\u2019s brain was in a mess, and the speculation of her ending was still lingering in her mind.She raised her eyelids, and her beautiful eyes fixed on Zhao Nanyu. She just opened her mouth to ask him something, when the door of the hall was pushed open. Song Heqing rushed in from the outside in a hurry. His handsome face was full of anxiety. \u201cAh Luan, I heard that you fainted?! Ah? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dSong Luan tried to smile at him. \u201cBrother, I didn\u2019t faint. I just had a stomachache.\u201dSong Heqing rushed forward, pushed Zhao Nanyu away, and looked at his sister with concern, \u201cHow can you have a stomachache?\u201dOn the way, he was almost scared to death. He originally came out to find Song Yu, who he couldn\u2019t find. When he caught a palace man, he asked. The palace man not only told him about Song Yu, but also told him about Song Luan.He was so frightened that he was afraid that Song Luan would be hurt to death, so he rushed here in a hurry.Song Luan didn\u2019t want Song Yu to tell her brother about her poisoning. Song Heqing was a terrible man in the court, but in front of his sisters in his family, he was very silly and sweet, and he believed everything her sisters said unconditionally.Song Heqing was really unbiased and loves every sister. She felt Song Heqing truly loved her even just the few times she spent with him. So\u2026 she didn\u2019t have the heart to let him know these silly accounts.\u201cI ate too much cold food, and had a bad stomachache.\u201dSong Heqing didn\u2019t know what to say about her. He poked her in the forehead. \u201cWhen can you be sensible!? Girls should eat less cold food.\u201dHe turned his head and scolded Zhao Nanyu, \u201cSo do you, how can you let her do that!? Why won\u2019t you stop her when she does this? Don\u2019t let everything go her way.\u201dSong Heqing said these with a little guilty conscience. He knew that his sister was a \u2018little boy\u2019, and no one could persuade her with her bad temper.When Song Heqing pushed Zhao Nanyu away, he was stunned. When he saw him poking Song Luan\u2019s face, his anger became even worse. Even brothers and sisters should not be so intimate.Zhao Nanyu said coldly, \u201cBrother, it\u2019s my fault.\u201dSong Heqing scolded him for awhile, and then calmed down. He coughed twice and asked Song Luan in a low voice, \u201cDoes it hurt now?\u201d\u201cNo more pain. \u201cThe pain disappeared after she took the antidote.Song Heqing raised his hand and touched the back of her head, thinking that her sister was so cute and ignorant. If she had been so obedient all her life, there would be no need to worry!A few days ago, Song Luan\u2019s little dog (HJ) dared to find him in the street. He was full of nonsense, saying that A Luan had been living in deep water all day, and asked him to bring her out of Zhao\u2019s house.Song Heqing laughed at that time, and was angry. He kicked the scoundrel away.\u201cI have said this many times. Don\u2019t be capricious in the future.\u201d He said this in Song Luan\u2019s ear.\u201cI really changed!\u201d Song Luan grumbled discontentedly.\u201cIt\u2019s better to change.\u201dZhao Nanyu coughed several times when he saw that this brother and sister were talking longer.Song Heqing was very discerning, knowing that he disturbed the couple. He got up, but didn\u2019t change his style whenever he leaves Song Luan. He didn\u2019t bring his purse today, so he gave her all the valuable things on his body.Little sister, you must be spoiled.Song Luan collected all the gold and silver jewelry he gave and held it like a small wealthy fan. She pointed to the bag in her arms and asked curiously, \u201cHow much are these worth?\u201dZhao Nanyu glanced at it. \u201cSeveral hundred Liang.\u201dHe reached for it. \u201cI\u2019ll put it away for you.\u201dSong Luan knew that she couldn\u2019t take it back. She quickly hid everything behind her and said softly, \u201cHow can you rob my money! I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re so poor.\u201dOf course, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t lack anything at this point. He was only possessive. He couldn\u2019t accept\u00a0that she would use other things given by others. Moreover, he couldn\u2019t let Song Luan hide too much money.Once the rabbit gets fat, it wants to run.Zhao Nanyu ridiculed her, \u201cIf you let others see this picture of you that you have never seen money before, they will definitely laugh at you.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t feel ashamed either. She said in a big way, \u201cNo one doesn\u2019t like money.\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t want me to help you?\u201d\u201cI can do it myself. \u201c\u201cOkay.\u201d He shrugged, as if he gave up.Zhao Nanyu was not in a hurry. He would take this away when she sleeps.Song Luan held the bag in her arms. She was also good at blocking it for fear that Zhao Nanyu would rush up and rob it.\u201cYou\u2019re tired?\u201d Zhao Nanyu asked her.\u201cNot too tired.\u201d\u201cThen we will go back to the palace.\u201dThe palace was a place of right and wrong. What would happen if they stay a little longer?Song Luan didn\u2019t want to stay in the palace anymore. Her legs were still soft. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want to let her go, so he went forward and held her back.Song Luan\u2019s hands were tied around his neck, and she looked up at his delicate side face, which was flawless. Song Luan thought of a lot of things, lost her mind for a moment, then blurted out the questions from the bottom of her heart. Her voice was very small, almost like a small whisper, \u201cWill you kill me?\u201dJust like in the book.He stabbed her heart with a knife.***Will he?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the wind howled in the cold night, he continued to walk in steps. He almost thought he had heard her wrong. He cut the nails and cut off the iron, so he decisively answered, \u201cNo.\u201dNow, how could he still be willing to kill her? He wished she had no worries or illness.Zhao Nanyu hugged the person in his arms more tightly, as if unintentionally, \u201cWhy do you suddenly ask?\u201dIt was still cool in the evening. Song Luan suddenly felt her arms were very warm. She nestled in his arms. Her mood was still a little low. \u201cNothing, I just asked.\u201dSong Luan thought it might be that he was too surprised. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want to kill her. He seemed pretty good to her. As for the plot of the original book, she was reluctant to think about it. The more she thought about it, the more painful her brain was, it was better to let it go.She still didn\u2019t plan to follow the plot line because it would hurt too many people, especially her obedient and pitiful four-year-old son.But she didn\u2019t know if there were consequences for deviating away from the original book.There must be a way to get there. Song Luan comforted herself like this.Zhao Nanyu held her waist tightly in his broad hands and murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t think about anything.\u201dSong Luan nodded, but this time she listened to his words, \u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Nanyu walked to the front of the palace with her in his arms. When the fireworks stopped, the officials scattered, and all of them went out of the palace together.The third lady of the Song family was really famous. In addition, her father was a proud man in the court. Most people had heard of Song Luan\u2019s right and wrong enmity with Zhao Nanyu, and many high spirited scholars mocked Zhao Nanyu in their hearts.At that time when they saw him holding Song Luan tenderly, for a while, they thought that the moon was misty. They wiped their eyes, but they did not see him wrong.The woman in his arms was really beautiful.The moonlight poured on her jade-like face. Her skin was white as snow, and her appearance was exquisite.\u00a0Zhao Nanyu raised his hand without trace, and the wide sleeve blocked her face.He quickened his pace, obviously eager to leave. But someone who didn\u2019t understand the vague atmosphere, went up and said hello to him, \u201cBrother Zhao.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded, \u201cLord Chen.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhao, why didn\u2019t I see you enjoying the fireworks? I also never seen your wife.\u201d Lord Chen had no malice. Recently, the sixth prince was in the limelight, and Zhao Nanyu was close to this prince. He was just trying to make a match.Zhao Nanyu was always very kind to his colleagues. Even though his heart was disgusted, he still replied flatly, \u201cMy wife was not well, so she didn\u2019t go watch the fireworks.\u201d\u201cSo it is.\u201d Lord Chen\u2019s eyes glanced at her, but the beauty was covered by Zhao Nanyu so tightly that he couldn\u2019t see anything. He smiled again and said, \u201cI wonder if brother Zhao is free tomorrow? I have something to ask brother Zhao.\u201dThe emperor had been ill for several months. His appearance at today\u2019s banquet was not good. Everyone was guessing that the emperor would choose a prince in this period of time. But they didn\u2019t know who the prince in the emperor\u2019s heart was?Tonight, he gave several marriages in one breath. The most prominent one was the sixth prince. In addition to the emperor\u2019s preference for the sixth prince these days, there were not a few people who were optimistic about this sixth prince.Zhao Nanyu thought about it and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan was oppressed by his sleeve. She just wanted to show her head, but she was pressed back mercilessly.The carriage was waiting at the gate of the palace. Zhao Nanyu held her up. At last, she could breathe. Her face was red and flustered.Since that time when she and Zhao Nanyu made love, he liked to move his hands and feet on her. It was normal for him to bite her twice. This time, he couldn\u2019t help biting her cheek.Song Luan turned her head angrily. She didn\u2019t talk to him on the way back to the residence.The lantern in front of Zhao\u2019s house was high. The two fierce stone lions look more ferocious at night.They almost came back at the same time with Zhao Erye.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s relationship with this second uncle was very rusty. They rarely speak together.After a salute, he took Song Luan\u2019s hand, and went straight back to the courtyard.Song Luan already slept in the palace for a while, so she was not sleepy at all. After bathing and washing her face, she sat in the middle of the bed cross legged in a chinese dress. When Zhao Nanyu took a bath, changed clothes, and came out of the screen, Song Luan remembered what she had forgotten.She held out her hand to Zhao Nanyu, \u201cThe gold and silver jewelry my brother gave me!!\u201dHer bag disappeared. It must be Zhao Nanyu who hid it for her.Zhao Nanyu wiped his hair and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll help you put it away first.\u201dSong Luan thought to herself that his character should not be a stingy man, how could he get greedy for her things now? What\u2019s more, Zhao Nanyu was not short of money at all, and he couldn\u2019t use the jewelry her brother gave!\u201cI have said that I don\u2019t want you to collect it for me. I have a place to put it! How can you take my things?\u201d Song Luan said angrily.Zhao Nanyu pondered for a moment, and thought that he didn\u2019t treat her well just now, so he said, \u201cTomorrow, go to the warehouse and pick out any jewelry that you like.\u201dAll the gold and silver jewelry in his storehouse were given by the emperor. Even if Song Luan wanted to sell those jewelries in the future, pawnshop wouldn\u2019t dare to buy it.Song Luan didn\u2019t know about it. After thinking, she thought it was not a loss. For fear that he would take it back, she said quickly, \u201cYou said it yourself. I will not be polite tomorrow. \u201dTaking whatever she wants means taking as much as she wants. Treasure is a good thing in any dynasty. No one would think too much.Zhao Nanyu swallowed the smile on his lips and nodded.Song Luan was not too sleepy at this time, and the boring books she read looked almost the same. She couldn\u2019t understand Zhao Nanyu\u2019s books, and couldn\u2019t mention her interest. She rolled twice in the bed, but she was still not sleepy. She put on a blouse and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see my son. He must miss me.\u201dZhao Nanyu held her wrist. \u201cI\u2019ll take him and let him sleep here tonight.\u201dHe detained little Zhao these days. He didn\u2019t let her get close to Song Luan for many days.This time, he would be happy for sure.Zhao Nanyu went to the front yard with a light lantern on his hand. Little Zhao was not yet asleep. He laid on the bed in a very serious position, his black eyes were wide open, staring blankly at the top of the bed, and didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.Zhao Nanyu lit the light in the room, found a coat for him, reached out and touched his head, and asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d No matter how serious he was, the voice of the child was still a little milky. He said, \u201cDad, I ate in my grandmother\u2019s house tonight. I waited for you and my mother for a long time, but neither you nor my mother came back.\u201dWhen his parents are not at home, he can\u2019t sleep well.Zhao Nanyu took him out of the bed and put on his coat for him. Then he picked up his son and said softly, \u201cI will take you to your mother\u2019s side to sleep. \u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s eyes were bent as he smiled and hugged his father\u2019s neck. He said sweetly, \u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Zhao Nanyu saw that he was smiling, he also laughed.The father and son soon arrived at Song Luan\u2019s residence from the front yard. The candles were bright inside. Song Luan couldn\u2019t wait to get off the bed when she heard the noise outside.She had an old habit of walking barefoot again.The barefoot girl rushed to the door and saw bright eyed little Zhao in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arms, \u201cYou came quickly.\u201dZhao Nanyu reminded her, \u201cPut on your shoes.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d She went up to take little Zhao. She looked at him with a smile, and asked, \u201cDoes this little son miss me?\u201dLittle Zhao replied honestly, \u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan liked to stay with her son. She was happy. She looked down at him carefully and sighed, \u201cDid you get thinner? There\u2019s not much flesh on this face as before.\u201dLittle Zhao shook his head. \u201cI eat very well, mother.\u201dSong Luan held him and thought that he was indeed lighter than before. She said, \u201cYou must be too tired with learning so much. Tomorrow I will stew soup for you and supplement your body. It\u2019s better to be fat and white. \u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s face turned red. \u201cMother, I\u2019m not a little boy.\u201dFour year olds also know that fat people don\u2019t look good. In fact, she couldn\u2019t say he was fat. He looked\u2026beautiful and looked cute with the little meat on his face.Song Luan chuckled, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s the deal. Come here after finishing your homework tomorrow noon, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe also wanted to eat what his mother made. Last time, the pastry was delicious. As long as his mother made it, even if it wasn\u2019t delicious, he liked it.Song Luan held the little child and was reluctant to give up. She seemed to have countless words to say, \u201cDid your uncle punish you when he taught you lessons?\u201dSong Luan still remembered that not only Zhao Chao who punished her son to copy, but also Zhao Nanyu.That time when she boldly told Zhao Nanyu not to punish little Zhao, the man promised her, but she didn\u2019t know if he was lying to her.Little Zhao originally wanted to say that he had been punished, because he couldn\u2019t lie, but his father suddenly coughed, so the child immediately understood, and shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201dSong Luan nodded contentedly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re only four years old. You can\u2019t be punished even if you don\u2019t understand how to read or how to learn.\u201d She was still uneasy, and told him, \u201cIf your uncle punishes you in the future, come and tell your mother.\u201dSong Luan knew in her heart that little Zhao was her son and shouldn\u2019t get hurt.Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t just watch anymore and said with a smile, \u201cYou are not afraid to spoil him.\u201d\u201cYou are too strict.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Nanyu patted his son\u2019s head. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Should you go to sleep?\u201dLittle Zhao reluctantly climbed down from Song Luan\u2019s lap, put on his shoes, and said to Song Luan, \u201cMother, I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201dHis bed was located on the side of the room. She had slept several times with little Zhao.He knew his way to the room so she didn\u2019t need to carry him.His short legs pedaled to the edge of the bed, climbed up the bed with a little effort, and covered himself.She embraced her lovely son contentedly before going back to room.Zhao Nanyu laid beside her without saying a word, and silently extinguished the candle.The room was in darkness. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s cold palm covered her hand.In the dark, Song Luan heard him ask, \u201cIs there anything else that is uncomfortable?\u201dSong Luan despised his cold hands and broke away. She turned over and turned her back to him. She didn\u2019t forget to answer, \u201cNo more.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dZhao Nanyu grabbed her waist and pulled the woman who was rolling fast to the corner of the wall. He held her firmly in his arms and held her close to his chest. He kissed her on the forehead. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s still my fault that I didn\u2019t take care of you.\u201dIt seems that he should not let her out in the future. There was no doubt about Song Luan\u2019s beauty. It could be seen from the many eyes that followed her today.She was even more beautiful when she dressed up. No one knows how many dignified gentlemen despised her temperament on their lips but covet her in their hearts.Zhao Nanyu thought, of course, he would hide her, and not give her a chance to be robbed.When he closed his eyes, he could still remember the feeling when he saw He Run holding her in his arms. His hatred and jealousy rushed to his head and couldn\u2019t help it.Song Luan had fallen asleep. She couldn\u2019t hear what he said, but she could feel someone kissing her all the time, like a mosquito that couldn\u2019t be driven away.Annoying to death.Zhao Nanyu covered her ears and blew softly, as if sighing, \u201cI really can\u2019t take you.\u201dI just fell in love with her.That night, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t touch her because he was afraid of her frail body. She slept in his arms.In the middle of the night, Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand the temperature on his body several times. Unfortunately, she was dragged back once when she rolled out of his arms.Finally she gave up resistance completely and laid in his arms.When she woke up, Zhao Nanyu was gone. Song Luan scratched her hair. She remembered that someone asked him to meet and talked about something last night. She guessed that he should have gone out.After getting up to wash, Zhao Nanyu was no longer in the residence.Song Luan first went to the housekeeper to ask for the key to the storehouse, and went to pick out the gold and silver jewelry in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s small vault!Zhao Nanyu\u2019s storehouse was richer than Song Luan thought. It seems that he had everything in several big boxes. She even saw a set of wedding clothes with excellent workmanship and full of gold thread. She could hardly walk.Song Luan swallowed very ignorantly. She carefully selected several sets of jewelry from the box. When she picked them, she asked the housekeeper what was more valuable?She took as much as she could. She wanted to change it to money with these jewelries in the future. How can she live such a good life?As a matter of fact, Zhao Nanyu had already calculated her mentality, and left her with no future.It was not early to pick out the jewelry, and Song Luan didn\u2019t forget that she told her son that she would make him stew.The cooks were not surprised that she went into the kitchen to cook. This lady had a remarkable ability.The stewed chicken and mushroom soup that Song Luan made was nutritious, delicious and fragrant. It took Song Luan two hours to stew the chicken.Song Luan tasted the soup. It was neither salty nor greasy. It was delicious!When the soup was ready, her son came.Walking together with little Zhao was Zhao Wenyan, who had just returned from the academy. He had less sharpness in his eyebrows than before, and his eyes were still clear.Song Luan\u2019s face was surprised. For a moment, she didn\u2019t know when he came back?Didn\u2019t he go to the academy?Zhao Wenyan looked at her uneasily and said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for my second brother.\u201dSong Luan frowned. \u201cYour second brother is not in the residence. He had gone out.\u201dHe shook his sleeve angrily, and somehow began to lose his temper, \u201cI know! I\u2019m leaving! \u201dSong Luan\u2019s face was full of ignorance. She really could never understand Zhao Wenyan\u2019s anger?! Adolescent children, the mind was really hard to guess.Zhao Wenyan went back halfway and then folded back. \u201cThen I will wait for my second brother to come back.\u201dHe insisted on staying, and Song Luan didn\u2019t want to bother with him. She was just focused with her chicken soup.Song Luan ignored Zhao Wenyan as much as possible, regarded him as air, and didn\u2019t take the initiative to talk with him. She was satisfied with only knowing him. \u00a0She filled a small bowl of soup for little Zhao. Afraid that he would drink it when it\u2019s too hot, she blew it deliberately, and then gave it to him, \u201cDrink.\u201dLittle Zhao picked up a bowl of soup and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good. \u201d\u201cIs it? How about stewing soup for you every day?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Little Zhao shook his head seriously, and said, \u201cFather will not agree.\u201dHis mother was not in good health. How could she stew soup for him every day? She\u2019ll be tired.Song Luan thought about it. It seems like Zhao Nanyu\u2019s thought process was different from that of ordinary people, so maybe he also wouldn\u2019t agree.\u201cOkay.\u201d But Song Luan explained to the child, \u201cIn fact, your mother\u2019s body is not so bad. She ate bad things a few days ago, but next time she would not. You don\u2019t have to worry about mother.\u201dThe child\u2019s heart was the most sensitive. Song Luan still didn\u2019t want her child to know too much at his early age, otherwise he would worry about her body. She hoped her son would be happy.He was very stubborn. \u201cNo, I have to take good care of my mother.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t convince him. \u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Wenyan was completely ignored. After eating, he stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dHe seems to hate Song Luan at first glance.Song Luan was very satisfied. It seems that only the things related to her could not be changed. But the fate of everyone else had changed.The more Zhao Wenyan acted like this to her, the happier she was.At dusk, Zhao Nanyu went back to the house. As soon as he entered the house, he asked, \u201cAyan has come to see you today? \u201dSong Luan was peeling melon seeds on her coach, and she gave him some, \u201cNo, he came to see you.\u201d She turned over and patted the dirt off her body.It was strange. \u201cHow do you know everything?\u201dZhao Nanyu opened his mouth and said, \u201cThe servants said.\u201dSong Luan did not doubt him. \u201cOh.\u201dShe had a tiger headed doll, and when he said this, she believed it.Of course, Song Luan didn\u2019t know that she was surrounded by Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes.The maidservants who attended her daily life, and the shadow guard who hid in the dark.\u2026.she lived in a huge net he had woven, and she wouldn\u2019t be able escape.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The branches outside the window swung with the wind, making a rustling sound.Song Luan didn\u2019t seem to want to talk to him. She sat on the window and bent her head to peel melon seeds. Zhao Nanyu walked over and asked, \u201cDid Ayan say why he was looking for me?\u201dSong Luan was surprised. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t say a word to me.\u201dZhao Wenyan despised her and lost his temper. He was no different from the wayward child. And Song Luan thought that he mostly felt disdain talking to her.Zhao Nanyu nodded, and his displeasure dissipated. He didn\u2019t want his brother to be too close to her. He had better not meet her again later, but as long as both of them were in Zhao\u2019s residence, they would have to meet once or twice.\u201cI\u2019ll ask him later.\u201d\u201cOh. \u201dFor a while, both husband and wife were silent again.Zhao Nanyu was not a talkative person. He picked up a book from the bookshelf.When Song Luan looked up, she saw his side face. After a while, she went back to her mind. After coughing twice, she remembered that she had another thing to say to him, \u201cThat\u2026I\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu stared at her. \u201cSay it.\u201dSong Luan wanted to go back to her mother\u2019s house recently. She still remembered several big turning points in the original book. After a few months, the emperor would die and the new emperor would ascend the throne.The Song family was involved with the wrong side. Song Luan\u2019s father was deprived of his official position. There was nothing left in the Song family. Both men and women were exiled. She thought of her good brother Song Heqing. She couldn\u2019t bear to see this big family destroyed.Song Luan just wanted to remind her father and brother that it didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t stand on the side of sixth prince. As long as he didn\u2019t oppose him, he won\u2019t have to settle with them in the future.She looked at Zhao Nanyu and said slowly, \u201cTomorrow I want to go back to Song residence to see my mother. \u201dZhao Nanyu put down the book in his hand, and suddenly wondered why she wanted to go home. He straightened his lips, and asked, \u201cI will go back with you in two days.\u201dHe was too busy these two days to spare time to accompany her back.Song Luan quickly waved her hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019ll go back myself, and I won\u2019t bother you.\u201dShe spoke in a polite way and regarded him as an outsider.Zhao Nanyu was silent for a long time. He seemed to be discussing with her in a gentle tone. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you when I\u2019m free. I\u2019m not sure if you can go by yourself. \u201dThe capital was really unstable these days.This morning, the emperor made an edict and granted the throne to sixth prince. The sixth prince, who was in the limelight because of the marriage, was even more noticeable this time.They had not yet figured out whether the emperor really intended to pass the crown prince title to sixth prince. At noon, the palace issued two more holy orders, and conferred the younger ninth prince and tenth prince respectively.The emperor\u2019s mind was hard to guess. No one could understand what the emperor wanted to do.However, several other princes who had sealed the king early had been eager to move. Anyone could see that the emperor\u2019s dragon body was uneasy during this day. If something unexpected happened, whoever had the military power in the capital was the last winner.The birth mother of sixth prince died early, and he grew up beside the queen when he was ten years old. However, they didn\u2019t have an amicable relationship, so the sixth prince couldn\u2019t rely on the queen.These days, the queen had secretly recalled her brothers who were guarding in Bincheng to the capital. This made chaos for a long time.Song Luan didn\u2019t think there would be any trouble in the capital city. What\u2019s more, she wouldn\u2019t even be affected if the gods fought. She looked at Zhao Nanyu and said, \u201cI\u2019m just going home, and I\u2019m not wandering around outside. What can happen?\u201dZhao Nanyu shook his head and smiled, \u201cWell, I know.\u201d After a pause, he said, \u201cBut I\u2019m still not sure. Would you just listen to me once?\u201dSong Luan was a little frustrated.Little Zhao probably inherited his stubbornness from him. He would never change his mind. But every time he used that kind of gentle tone, she would be embarrassed to quarrel with him. It gave her a kind of illusion that she was ignorant.She knew she couldn\u2019t beat him, and lost her face. \u201cI know.\u201dSong Luan was also a good speaker. She didn\u2019t really intend to promise anything to him.Zhao Nanyu was not at home in the daytime. Wasn\u2019t it easy for her to go out?Seeing her dejected, Zhao Nanyu knew that she was not happy. He squeezed her bulging cheek and said nothing.After dinner, a woman she had never met came in.Zhao Nanyu said to her, \u201cThis is Grandma Lin. I asked her to come here and take care of your body. \u201dSong Luan had the problem of being picky about food, so he was afraid that she won\u2019t drink the medicine well because it was bitter. The servant girls couldn\u2019t control what she could eat. Zhao Nanyu invited this Grandma, who took care of her brother, to come here.Grandma Lin who looked serious. She respectfully saluted Song Luan, \u201cI pay respects to Madam.\u201dSong Luan nodded, \u201cGet up.\u201dGrandma Lin didn\u2019t like the lady who she had only seen a few times. When she first saw their son, he was less than a year old. She saw that this woman\u00a0didn\u2019t care about her own child, and didn\u2019t even worry when he fell ill.At that time, she thought that the young master had a good temper. This kind of woman had long abandoned her family.Unexpectedly, one day she would be called to serve this madam.After meeting, Zhao Nanyu asked Grandma Lin to retreat. He slowly explained to Song Luan, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for someone to look at you. Grandma Lin not only takes care of people, but also can make medicinal meals that taste good. You will like them.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cLook after me??? \u201dShe didn\u2019t really think about it. Looking after her? For what?Zhao Nanyu\u2019s reaction was very quick. Seeing her appearance, he knew that she didn\u2019t think much. He felt relieved and laughed secretly.\u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t take your medicine well.\u201dSong Luan was scared to death by him and mistakenly thought that he would do what she did to the female lead.\u00a0He kept her locked at home. In his world, nothing could escape his eyes.She didn\u2019t want it.Yes, the male lead was still normal now.Song Luan said, \u201cI\u2019ve been much better recently. My chest and brain doesn\u2019t hurt. Besides, the medicine is too bitter. \u201d\u201cDrink more of the bitter medicine.\u201d\u201cOh. \u201dAlthough Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t speak much, he always liked to bite her ear and say something shameful in bed. Song Luan was never his opponent in this respect.She was coaxed three or two times, and was taken to bed in a confused manner.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s aggression made her unable to resist, and she tried to ran away with tears. He just grabbed her ankle and pulled her back. He lowered his head and sucked the tears from her eyes. He said in a loving voice, \u201cIt\u2019s still early. What can you do in the middle of the night?\u201dAnd she suffered.Song Luan\u2019s heart trembled, her eyes were red than rabbit\u2019s.She was bullied too hard by him. Before she went to sleep, she suddenly realized a very serious problem. She had not drunk any contraceptive pill, what would she do if she had a child?It was a pity that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t give her the strength to think deeply. After tossing and turning, she was already tired and had no heart to think.In the early morning of the second day, the first thing she did after she woke up was to go out. It was impossible to go out in a proper way, but there was still a back door in Zhao residence, and she planned to sneak out through the back door.Grandma Lin looked at the blue and purple bruises on her shoulder and ordered people to pump water in and find ointment for her. Song Luan took the ointment on her face and refused to let Grandma Lin apply the medicine to her.Her skin was delicate and easy to leave a mark. It looked scary, but actually it didn\u2019t hurt.Grandma Lin\u2019s eyes were sharp, and she was relieved when Song Luan drank the tonic.Song Luan\u2019s whole body was uncomfortable when she saw her. Fortunately, \u00a0she was not always waiting for her in her room.After she finished drinking the medicine, Grandma Lin went to work.Song Luan sent away all the other servant girls in the room, and then changed into a set of servant clothes timidly. She opened the door fearfully and quickly ran out of the room.***Although the back door was small, there were also small guards guarding the door.Song Luan waited for half the incense stick by the door, and didn\u2019t doze off. She was very dedicated, and\u00a0didn\u2019t dare to act rashly.Song Luan bit her teeth and turned to the wall in the backyard. She remembered that Huai Jin turned in from that wall last time. There should be no one there.She kept her head down along the way, and no one saw her.Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0suddenly\u00a0thought,\u00a0\u2018why\u00a0did she go so low as to\u00a0climb\u00a0a\u00a0wall?\u2019She\u00a0shouldn\u2019t\u00a0have\u00a0given\u00a0in\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0power\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0man\u00a0last\u00a0night.She should have said that she would go back to her mother\u2019s house! But now it\u2019s no use regretting.\u00a0In order not to let Zhao Nanyu find out that she lied and said nothing, she had to go out by climbing the wall.The corner of the backyard was not too high. Song Luan found some big stones to pad her feet, and tied up the skirt in the way. She looked around, and made sure that no one was around.She started climbing the wall quickly. With the height of the stone, she easily climbed up the corner.Song Luan closed her eyes and jumped. She found a young boy squatting under the corner of the outer wall. He was wearing orange clothes and the skin on his face was shining white under the sun. He was a beautiful boy.Song Luan and Huai Jin looked at each other. She choked for a moment. She\u2019s was afraid of what was coming!She didn\u2019t know what to say.When Huai Jin saw her, his eyes lit up like a shining star. He stood up with a rather aggrieved tone. \u201cAh Luan, I have been waiting for you for many days! \u201dHe squatted in this corner and guarded for many days.\u201cYou finally came to me, but how did you know I was under the wall?\u201dIf she knew he was under the wall, she wouldn\u2019t climb out at all.Song Luan secretly congratulated herself..Fortunately, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t see it! Otherwise, it would be a scene of \u00a0\u2018Caught in the Red-Apricot wall crime scene\u2019It seems that her luck was not too bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he looked at Song Luan with red eyes and disappointed look, he felt a little guilty.Song Luan didn\u2019t even think that this child would be so stubborn. Because she didn\u2019t go to him, he stood outside the wall waiting.The corner of the wall was not a good place to talk. Song Luan looked left and right and found no one else. She was still uneasy. She grabbed his sleeve and dragged him under the tree in the corner.Under the shade of the tree, the golden light fell on his cheek through the leaves. The boy was almost white, and his lips were red and his white teeth were beautiful.Song Luan tried to reason with him and said, \u201cHuai Jin, I didn\u2019t know you were waiting for me. I have other important matters today. I really don\u2019t have time to talk with you more. I\u2019ll go first.\u201dHuai Jin easily reacted, he grabbed her arm and the corner of his mouth bent down. His voice was loud. \u201cWhere are you going?!\u201dSong Luan quickly covered his mouth for fear that he would attract others. She lowered her voice and patiently explained, \u201cI\u2019m going first, so hurry back.\u201d and she\u00a0started to run.He followed her closely. His angry face turned green. \u201cAre you going to leave me?\u201dHuai Jin was a smart person. Song Luan didn\u2019t come to see him in such a long time. She probably didn\u2019t want him anymore. This thought made Huai Jin sad.He didn\u2019t know what he had done to make her angry.Song Luan thought for a moment. She thought it would be a good thing to speak clearly with Huai Jin now, so as not to hurt him in the future.She turned sideways, and her face was frozen. Finally, she said, \u201cHuai Jin, I\u2026\u201dAs soon as Song Luan opened her mouth, Huai Jin knew what she wanted to say. He blocked his ears with his hands like a rogue. \u201cI won\u2019t listen. I won\u2019t listen.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything yet and you won\u2019t listen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a good word.\u201dSong Luan sighed for a long time, but even if Huai Jin didn\u2019t want to hear it, she would still say it, \u201cI didn\u2019t do the right thing before. Huai Jin, I already have a husband and a son. I\u2019m a woman, you\u2019re a man. We should not go so close in the future. You\u2019re better off living your own life.\u201dSuch a beautiful boy must be liked by many girls in the future.Song Luan wanted to find a good future for him as much as possible, rather than dying in the ice and snow.Looking at Huai Jin\u2019s face, it could almost kill flies between his eyebrows. His face was as black as the bottom of a pot. He shouted angrily, \u201cBut you don\u2019t like that man with the surname Zhao! You said you were going to leave him, and we\u2026.we originally have no relationship like that. I won\u2019t do that with you!\u201dSong Luan was completely relieved\u00a0that the original owner and him still had good manners and didn\u2019t break through the bottom line of the relationship between men and women.Since she couldn\u2019t persuade him, Song Luan didn\u2019t want to waste her precious time. She had to go back to Song\u2019s residence as soon as possible.She had to come back before dark.Huai Jin\u2019s goal was not to leave her, but to follow her behind. He\u00a0followed her all the way, and finally realized that the two had come to the gate of the Song residence.Two days ago, he was kicked by Song Luan\u2019s brother in the street. The location was not too different from where Zhao Nanyu kicked. He still felt the pain until now.Song Luan was recognized by all the servants in front of the Song residence. They were stunned as they wiped their eyes and made sure they didn\u2019t see it wrong.Then, they hurried up to meet her! \u201cThird lady, how did you come back?! You didn\u2019t tell us beforehand.\u201dSong Luan said slowly, \u201cI came back to see my mother, should I still report that?\u201d\u201cI dare not. Come in quickly. I\u2019ll inform Aunt Lin right now.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go in and find my mother myself. \u201dShe entered the gate of the Song family, but Huai Jin was blocked at the gate. Several bodyguards blocked the gate tightly. They seem to have known Huai Jin for a long time.Also, who didn\u2019t know the friendship he had with the third lady?Song Luan found Aunt Lin\u2019s yard according to her last memory. When she arrived, Aunt Lin was picking up silk and satin to make autumn clothes she would wear this year.Song Luan\u2019s sudden appearance really scared Aunt Lin, \u201cAh Luan, where did you come from?\u201dAunt Lin\u2019s gold and silver jewelry almost blinded Song Luan\u2019s eyes. She replied, \u201cI stopped by today to see you.\u201dShe didn\u2019t dare to tell her mother the truth.Aunt Lin seldom doubts the truth of her words. She held her hand, smiled and said, \u201cYou are still filial and still know to come back to see me.\u201dAfter saying this, Aunt Lin told the maidservant inside the room to go out. She didn\u2019t like having outsiders whenever she talks with her baby daughter.Song Luan sat down and poured herself a glass of water. She took a small half of the cup and licked her lips. She asked, \u201cMother, can you speak to father?\u201dAunt Lin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy do you ask? What\u2019s your idea again?\u201dSong\u00a0Luan\u00a0swallowed\u00a0her\u00a0throat,\u00a0but\u00a0refused\u00a0to\u00a0answer,\u00a0only\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0pampered\u00a0with\u00a0her\u00a0mother.\u00a0\u201cTell\u00a0me\u00a0first.\u201dAunt Lin felt that her precious daughter was the most beautiful and charming in the world. Song luan didn\u2019t need to ask.Song Luan asked directly, \u201cCan you say one or two words to father?\u201dThis was her modest words. Song Luan was so beautiful, and Aunt Lin was her biological mother. Her appearance was not bad. Although she was old now, she still had charms.In addition, Aunt Lin\u2019s temperament was excellent. She was very soft when it needed to be in front of Song Luan\u2019s father. In these years, she is still had the favor of Song Luan\u2019s father.At least if she speaks, the master would be willing to listen to her.Song Luan\u2019s mind gradually relaxed. She was afraid that Aunt Lin would not be able to speak to her father. In that way, she couldn\u2019t remind her father not to go against the sixth prince.\u201cMom, I heard a message from Ah Yu yesterday.\u201dAunt Lin raised her ears, \u201cTell me.\u201dSong Luan confirmed that the doors and windows were closed, so she whispered in Aunt Lin\u2019s ear, \u201cI heard that the emperor intended to pass the throne to the sixth prince.\u201dOf course, she just made this nonsense up. She didn\u2019t know who the emperor wanted to take over his position, but she knew that the future emperor was the sixth prince, which was enough.Aunt Lin stared and was surprised. \u201cMy God, Luanbao, you are so good. I thought you only know how to have fun, and make fun of things. It\u2019s good.\u201dAfter she paused, she asked, \u201cBut where did Ah Yu get the news?\u201dNo matter how many times she was asked, she couldn\u2019t explain it, so she pretended to be unhappy. \u201cMother, don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d\u201cOh, I believe in you.\u201d Aunt Lin also guessed the deep meaning of Song Luan\u2019s words to her. If the emperor wanted the sixth prince to be the next in line, wouldn\u2019t their family fight with the sixth prince in the future?Aunt Lin also knew something about the court. She usually had tea and flowers with the wives and concubines of the dignitaries. She talked about rouge and gouache, but occasionally talked about who was demoted and who was promoted.\u201cMom, just believe me. I\u2019m afraid something will happen to our family.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your mother will speak about this to your father.\u201d Aunt Lin was tactful and could speak very well. If she wanted to tell the master about it, she would not be as straightforward as Song Luan.Suddenly, Song Luan heard the cry faintly. She raised her eyes and looked at Aunt Lin foolishly. She asked, \u201cNiang, is anyone crying in the house?\u201dWhen Aunt Lin heard this, her eyes seemed to glow, and her face was full of gloating ridicule. \u201cAh, it\u2019s your sister, Song Yu, who is crying.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s hand holding the teacup was stagnant, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201dAunt Lin said slowly, \u201cSince the evening when she came back from the palace, she began to have stomachache. She couldn\u2019t see several doctors well. You didn\u2019t see her, but in a few days, she became too thin and didn\u2019t look good. I feel sorry for her.\u201dSong Luan looked at her mother\u2019s smile, which couldn\u2019t be suppressed. \u00a0She was in a complex mood.Aunt Lin talked about other people\u2019s affairs with great enthusiasm and kept on talking. \u201cYesterday, I invited a Taoist master to take care of it.\u201d\u201cWhat did the master say?\u201d Her intuition told her that this must be Zhao Nanyu\u2019s revenge for her.Aunt Lin almost didn\u2019t laugh out loud.She didn\u2019t like Song Yu at all. She was very pitiful.\u00a0For the past four years, her eyes towards Zhao Nanyu was still the same ever since the first time Zhao Nanyu came to the Song residence.\u201cThe doctor said that she was guilty of evil in her life. Only when there is a happy event can she get rid of it.\u201d She moistened her throat, and then said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that she is at the age of marriage. Now, she was given a good candidate. They have cooperated with each other and talked about marriage. They just made an appointment this morning, but your sister has something in her heart. She has been crying since the morning.\u201dWhat was the use of crying? She still had to marry even if she didn\u2019t want to marry.Aunt Lin wanted to watch a good play. In this way, Song Yu didn\u2019t have to wait for her son-in-law (ZN) to give up the marriage with Luanbao.Song Luan naturally had no affection for Song Yu, a person who targeted her, so she kept silent for a long time and finally jumped out of her mouth and said, \u201cThis is very good.\u201dHaving said that, Song Luan didn\u2019t plan to stay in Song\u2019s residence this long, and Aunt Lin didn\u2019t keep her long.Aunt Lin once again cried at the door. This time, she didn\u2019t see the carriage or even a person to serve her daughter. Aunt Lin knew what was going on.But she firmly believed that there was a reason for her daughter to do this thing, and her baby daughter would never be wrong.Aunt Lin also secretly stuffed a bag of gold leaves into Song Luan\u2019s sleeve, for fear that she would be cold and hungry and poor.Song Luan returned to the road and climbed back to the high wall according to the previous method. She didn\u2019t know that someone was waiting for her like an assailant waiting for its prey.Zhao Nanyu was dressed in a blue tunic. The light wind raised his sleeves. His hair was tied up high. His facial features were three points sharp, and a\u00a0killing aura showed in his face.He stood with his hands on his back and his lips raised slightly.He looked at her on the high wall and smiled. The soft wind brought his gentle voice to Song Luan\u2019s ears. He said, \u201cBe careful. I\u2019ll wait for you from below. Don\u2019t hurt yourself. \u201dSong Luan shivered violently and her legs became soft.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhao Nanyu came back earlier than she expected.Seeing her slow to move, Zhao Nanyu bent his eyes and whispered, \u201cJump down. I\u2019ll take care of you. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dHis beautiful eyebrows seemed to have a smile. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem angry at all. He didn\u2019t blame her for what she did. But Song Luan\u2019s heart was shaking when she listened to his words. She couldn\u2019t stand still, so she fell off the high wall without noticing.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t deceive her. He caught her steadily. It seemed that he didn\u2019t intend to let her go.As he walked into the house, he said, \u201cFortunately, I am here. If I\u2019m not here, won\u2019t you fall to the ground?\u201d He gave a low laugh, his muffled and laughing voice were very pleasant.Song Luan lowered her eyes, not only did she not dare to look at him, but also did not answer his words. She was still very guilty this time. After all, she deceived him first. She couldn\u2019t stand upright in front of him.At dusk, the sky in the distance was red with the afterglow of the setting sun.After entering the house, Song Luan rolled down from him. Zhao Nanyu looked at her quietly with a smile on his face.Song Luan\u2019s clothes were dirty, and the pink skirt was stained with dirt on the corners.Her gray-faced face looked really embarrassing.She lowered her head and stared at her toes. She was waiting for Zhao Nanyu to settle accounts with her. The man was very stingy and would not spare her. She waited for a long time, but there was no movement from the person in front of her.Zhao Nanyu was calm as he touched her face. \u201cI\u2019ll ask someone to give you water to bathe. You\u2019ve become a little dirty cat.\u201dThe more he was like this, the more Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand it. She had a sudden headache.She took her clean clothes and went to the screen to take a bath.Then she took off her clothes and sat in the tub. The petals were floating on the water, sending out a light fragrance as it steamed. Song Luan\u2019s body gradually relaxed.Song Luan had been lying in the tub for a long time. It was not that she spent a long time in the bath. She just didn\u2019t want to go out to face Zhao Nanyu. She would rather let Zhao Nanyu scold her that she didn\u2019t keep her promise.She didn\u2019t want to see him smile.It was really scary.After half a stick of incense, the water was already getting cold. Song Luan didn\u2019t want to get up from the tub.After getting dressed, she walked out slowly.Zhao Nanyu went up to wipe her hair by hand. He said, \u201cIf you really want to go out, why do you have to climb over the wall? It doesn\u2019t matter if you climb the wall, but if you break your leg, you will never get it back.\u201dFor some reason, the big stone in Song Luan\u2019s chest fell to the ground. After a long time of fear, Zhao Nanyu finally began to say that she had climbed the wall.Maybe it\u2019s her prejudice against Zhao Nanyu, but Song Luan thought that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s last sentence was frightening her, suggesting that if she climbs the wall again, he would break her dog\u2019s leg.She opened her mouth and wanted to talk. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t give her the chance to talk, and continued, \u201cI\u2019m also to blame. I didn\u2019t allow you to go out.\u201dSong Luan dared not let him admit his mistake, and murmured, \u201cThis time it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s nothing to do with you. I don\u2019t mean what I say.\u201dZhao Nanyu smelled the light fragrance on her body and smiled, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t mention it. Next time don\u2019t do this rash thing again. I\u2019m afraid that you will be hurt.\u201dHis lips were full of laughter, and Song Luan was so annoyed by him.Zhao Nanyu then said, \u201cYou love beauty so much so you shouldn\u2019t leave scars on yourself.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s throat was tight, and spewed a word out of her mouth with difficulty. \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter so many lessons, Song Luan was not naive enough to think that Zhao Nanyu had just let her go. Moreover, since he kept under the corner, he must have known that Huai Jin had been squatting on the wall. It was strange that this dead man didn\u2019t mention anything.When Song Luan went out, she was still lamenting her good luck.Before the day ended, she overturned her car.Today, she looked like she was climbing the wall to meet a wild man.In the middle of the night, Song Luan crawled into bed trembling. Zhao Nanyu wore a white tunic, with his long silky black hair scattered around. The candlelight reflected his perfectly jade white face.He had a book in his left hand. Seeing Song Luan coming, he quietly collected it.Song Luan\u2019s heart was frightened by his burning eyes. She had a premonition that tonight would not be easy!Maybe Zhao Nanyu was waiting for her here! This man liked to torture her in bed.Not to mention torture, she would feel uncomfortable in addition to being tired.Song Luan was suddenly thrown into bed by his strength, and she was trapped in the quilt. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s long fingers slowly caressed her cheek and it slowly fell on her collar.He chuckled softly and didn\u2019t say anything. He bit her lips. This time it was a real bite. She took a breath of cold air as it hurt.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s movements were never gentle and fragrant. He would not let her go. He whispered in her ear, \u201cIs Huai Jin beautiful?\u201dSong Luan replied in her heart, beautiful.But she didn\u2019t dare say it.She didn\u2019t open her mouth. Zhao Nanyu had some ways to make her speak.Song Luan felt that her waist was not her own.\u201cIs he beautiful?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026not beautiful.\u201d Song Luan almost cried out.Zhao Nanyu kissed her chin, nodded contentedly, and began to ask the next question, \u201cIs he good-looking or am I?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026it\u2019s you.\u201d She sobbed.Zhao Nanyu smiled. \u201cHe is infatuated with you. He has been guarding for half a month.\u201dSong Luan shrank back and sniffed. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. He and I are just friends.\u201dShe also only treated Huai Jin as her younger brother. She didn\u2019t dare to be involved with Huai Jin.She also hoped that this time Huai Jin would not provoke Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hatred because of her, and would result to his tragic ending.Zhao Nanyu looked at her and knew what she was thinking. He took some of her wet hair and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t move him.\u201dZhao Nanyu had a deep mind and knew that Huai Jin still had a position in Song Luan\u2019s mind. He would not give Huai Jin a chance to win sympathy.These concubines\u2026he would slowly clean up, one by one, in the long run. He was really not in a hurry.Song Luan was very relieved. She was really afraid of him.At the beginning, Zhao Nanyu also said in her face that if he saw any wild man who had relationship with her again, he would kill them one by one.Song Luan didn\u2019t sleep well this evening. She had several small nightmares one after another. Zhao Nanyu in the dream was dressed in a white robe, and his clean clothes were splashed with red blood. He held a sword in his hand. The tip of the sword was dripping with blood.The bloody Zhao Nanyu smiled at her and raised his hand. Song Luan found that his other empty hand was holding her heart.Song Luan\u2019s face was so white that she woke up immediately. It was still early, and the sky outside the window was still dark.But there was no one around Song Luan. Zhao Nanyu went out early for several days in a row. The situation in the capital was complicated. He was busy discussing with the sixth prince.The queen\u2019s family came with a lot of force, but she went back to capital without permission.However, the emperor didn\u2019t go to the court for several days. He never came out of the Wenhua palace. The queen refused to allow anyone to visit him for the sake of recuperation.If the emperor didn\u2019t survive this, the world would fall into the hands of the tenth young prince.Song Luan knew that the day of the emperor\u2019s death was not in this period of time. He would have to spend a few months. Within two days, the emperor should wake up.However, these things had nothing to do with Song Luan. She had already reminded the Song family once. If she met her brother Song Heqing, she would remind him again. If his brother believed what she said, it would now depend on his fate.At the end of summer and early autumn, the temperature of the day changed greatly, which made people shiver in the both the night and day. At the highest time of noon, they need to take off clothes.Song Luan had chosen the cloth early and asked grandma Lin to send it to the tailor\u2019s shop to make new clothes, not only for her, but also for Zhao Nanyu and little Zhao.There was no lack of homework for little Zhao. The poor four-year-old had to study for three hours every day. He was a premature baby and did not have a person to look after him. Before long, little Zhao got sick and had a high fever.Song Luan\u2019s eyes were red and she put the baby on the bed. She hurriedly said to grandma Lin, \u201cGo find a doctor!\u201dShe put her hand on her son\u2019s forehead and felt the temperature. It was okay if it\u2019s not too hot.Zhao Chao stood aside and coughed twice. \u201cSecond sister-in-law, give me little Zhao.\u201dSong Luan subconsciously hugged her son and forgot that Zhao Chao was still a doctor. \u201cNo need.\u201dShe also felt that Zhao Chao had put too much pressure on her son which made him sick.Zhao Chao was also in a bad temper. Although he seemed to hate Song Luan even more, he still loved this little kid, and he was reluctant to see him suffer from a high fever.He said, \u201cSister-in-law, don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m a doctor. I can see little Zhao\u2019s situation.\u201dHearing this, Song Luan gradually released little Zhao. She shook his hand and bowed her head, saying, \u201cLook at him now. \u201cZhao Chao breathe a sigh of relief after passing the pulse. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fever.\u201d\u201cJust?!\u201d Song Luan sneered and continued to quarrel with him.The child in her arms closed his eyes and groaned as if it was hard. Little Zhao reached out his little finger and slowly grasped her light sleeve. He said weakly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mother, I will soon be okay.\u201dHis illness was normal. The body and bones of the premature infant were weak. Little Zhao was a good child. He didn\u2019t want to talk about his little discomfort and the pain in his body.Song Luan embraced him and made up her mind that she must take care of her son.Seeing that his mother was still unhappy, he got up and kissed her on her left cheek, \u201cMother, I will sleep now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The child was listless. He was leaning his head against her chest.Song Luan was so worried, but she could only wait for Zhao Chao to prepare the antipyretic medicine and send it to the kitchen for boiling. She wanted to fetch some water to wipe his body, because he was extraordinarily sticky from his own sweat. He tightly grabbed her clothes and refused to let go. He shook her head. \u201cMother, don\u2019t go.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart softened, so she held him and didn\u2019t let go. Fortunately, the antipyretic medicine was soon ready, and the black medicine was still steaming with hot water. Song Luan took the hot medicine bowl and blew it cold. Then, she fed her son a spoonful of the medicine.This medicine smelled bitter, but little Zhao didn\u2019t cry or even frown.He swallowed it.The bitter medicine was fed to him smoothly. Song Luan took out a handkerchief and wiped the corners of his mouth for him. She looked at him painfully and asked, \u201cIs the medicine bitter or not?\u201dLittle Zhao nodded, \u201cBitter.\u201dAre there any medicine that are not bitter?Song Luan ordered grandma Lin to bring up some candied fruits. She coaxed her son, \u201cIt won\u2019t be bitter if you eat some candied fruits.\u201dLittle Zhao picked out two candied fruits from her palms. \u201cFather said that I can\u2019t eat too much. If I eat too much, my teeth will be broken.\u201dNo matter how distorted Zhao Nanyu\u2019s character was, Song Luan couldn\u2019t deny that he really taught his son very well. His rules were sensible.After feeding the medicine, the temperature on little Zhao\u2019s forehead went down a little bit. It wasn\u2019t as hot as before.Song Luan stuffed him very carefully into the quilt, afraid that he would freeze. She pinched her son\u2019s soft cheek and said, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201dTake medicine and then go to sleep. This would make him better.His eyes were wide open, and the dark eyes followed her closely. He was reluctant to move or close his eyes. He refused to sleep.Song Luan smiled, lowered her head and asked softly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sleep?\u201dIt was reasonable that people would get sleepy after taking medicine.Adults were more vulnerable than usual when they are sick.He reached out his hands from the quilt and looked at Song Luan with eyes. \u201cI want to hug mother.\u201dHis eyes were big and round. Song Luan couldn\u2019t resist the expectation in his eyes and the kind of pleading. She just took off her shoes and climbed onto the bed. Little Zhao hugged her neck and smiled at her sweetly.Song Luan seldom saw this child smile. He usually had no expression on his face.Song Luan patted him on the shoulder and asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep?\u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s brain was still a little dim. With a strong nasal sound, he replied in a milk voice, \u201cMm-hmm. \u201dBefore, when his mother didn\u2019t like him, he had never been held by her, slept with her, or cared for as carefully as he was today.Later, when his mother treated him better and better, he was happy, but grew dissatisfied because he could only meet her for a few days.Apart from having lunch with his mother every day, he spent most of his time in the front yard. It could be seen that although his father loved him, he didn\u2019t like him sleeping with his mother very much.Moreover, his uncle said that he was now a four-year-old. When his uncle was four years old, he also lived in the front yard early. No one in the family stuck to his mother like him.After thinking about it, Song Luan said, \u201cShall I tell you a story?\u201dLittle Zhao looked at her with bright eyes, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t know what kind of stories he wanted to hear, so she chose some familiar stories to tell him. \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a temple with three monks. One day, the master asked them to fetch water together.\u201dHer voice was soft and her tone was gentle. She told the story and the child in her arms had already closed their eyes and fell asleep.In the night, Zhao Nanyu came back late. He was wrapped in cold air as he walked to the door to cover himself from nightly breeze. He pushed the door open. The candle fire in the room was not bright, and the faint yellow was enough to brighten the room.At a glance, Zhao Nanyu saw Song Luan, who sat in front of the dressing mirror, removing her headdress. He quietly walked over and asked, \u201cLittle Zhao is ill?\u201dAs soon as he came back, grandma Lin told him about it.Song Luan froze for a moment and nodded, \u201cYes, he had a fever. He took medicine first before he fell asleep.\u201dZhao Nanyu frowned. \u201cIn the other side of the room?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Song Luan turned around and looked up to see his face. His facial features were hidden in the dim yellow light, and the lines of his lower jaw were tight and slightly cold.She summoned up her courage and said slowly, \u201cI want to bring my son to my side.\u201dSong Luan was already prepared that Zhao Nanyu would not agree with her. After all, she had abused the child before.She had beaten and scolded her son.The day before she transmigrated, the original owner did not give him food.So even if Song Luan knew that Zhao Nanyu liked her a little now, she didn\u2019t think he would trust her with his child.Sure enough, Zhao Nanyu did not agree.\u201cNo.\u201d It seems that there was no room for discussion. But the reason why Zhao Nanyu refused was not what Song Luan thought.Song Luan opened her mouth and lowered her voice, \u201cI know\u2026 I wasn\u2019t good at taking care of my son before, but I won\u2019t be like that now, I will take good care of him. You also think he is still young, but you are also busy. You can\u2019t always look after him, but I can! Can you just trust me once? \u201dZhao Nanyu gave her a deep look and shook his head slowly. He was not moved. \u201cHe is not small. When I was the same age as him, I had no father or mother around me. You are spoiling him. It\u2019s not good for him.\u201dSong Luan had a headache. She felt that she and Zhao Nanyu were not in the same page.\u201cI am not spoiling him! You\u2019re misinterpreting me!\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows. Indeed, he said that on purpose. The child\u2019s mind had been cultivated. Even if Song Luan wanted to spoil this child, he would be very self disciplined to restrain himself.Zhao Nanyu just felt that if little Zhao would be taken care by her, it would take up Song Luan\u2019s hard work and energy. All her attention would be with the child.Song Luan didn\u2019t really want to stay with Zhao Nanyu. He never saw love from those beautiful eyes when they looked at him.As soon as their son came, there was nothing more important than him.\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d After a pause, Zhao Nanyu coaxed her softly. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s stop quarreling. I\u2019ll pick two more maidservants to serve him. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dLittle Zhao had been weak since he was a child. In the past four years, Zhao Nanyu had been used to his illness recurring several times a year. Song Luan hadn\u2019t paid much attention to recovering her son\u2019s body these past few years.Song Luan blurted out, \u201cHe is my child. Can I not worry?\u201dShe regretted it once her voice came out.Zhao Nanyu looked at her and sighed, and he compromised. \u201cSo I\u2019ll let him come to live here when he doesn\u2019t have a class.\u201dSong Luan had a natural sense of fear in front of Zhao Nanyu. This fear may be due to knowing the plot in advance.Knowing Zhao Nanyu\u2019s vicious and cruel nature, and the more she had in contact with him, the more she knew that Zhao Nanyu was really not easy to provoke.She did not ask for any more conditions, and said in a muffled voice, \u201cThat will do. \u201d***Sickness comes like a mountain, sickness goes like a silkwormHe had a bad illness for a long time. The fever subsided but he began to cough again. Within a few days, his voice became hoarse. Song Luan had no choice but to find Zhao Chao and ask him to prescribe a new prescription.After examining the pulse, Zhao Chao\u2019s face sank, and he sneered, \u201cHis sickness is probably not from second sister-in-law\u2019s birth, but because he was abused again and again.\u201dHe obviously blamed Song Luan for this.Song Luan was speechless. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cForget it. I\u2019ll complain this to second brother.\u201d Zhao Chao hurriedly went to the pharmacy and picked up the medicine again.Song Luan was ridiculed by Zhao Chao\u2019s strange and gloomy spirit. Apart from feeling a little anger that stuck in her chest, she didn\u2019t know whether she was angry at herself, Song Luan looked pale and haggard.Zhao Chao brought the medicine himself after decocting it, and watched Song Luan feed the medicine to little Zhao before he left.After he passed by, his footsteps stopped.He stared at her silently for a long time, and retracted his gaze again. Because of pride, he still did not ask what he wanted to ask.Zhao Chao also thought it was strange. He had seen her look better some days before. He thought there was nothing wrong with her.How could it be that after just over half a month, her appearance became worse.Song Luan deviated from the plot line of the original owner. There were no consequences that she knew of. She only thought that she took over this body to continue the plot.Even the medicine was not enough to stop Song Luan\u2019s body from decaying so fast.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s \u2018tianqing\u2019 under her body was also gradually waking up, and the combination of the two caused this current situation.Song Luan deliberately fought with Zhao Nanyu in cold war, which was what the original master would do to Zhao Nanyu, so she managed to maintain the human structure by mistake, and her health gradually improved.And all this happened silently.\u00a0Song Luan had not yet understood this, and she was not even willing to admit that her body was gradually declining.Perhaps because little Zhao was sick, Zhao Nanyu came back very early this day. He stood by the door and didn\u2019t make a sound. He watched Song Luan\u2019s gentle voice coaxing little Zhao to drink medicine.After the medicine was fed, Song Luan walked out with an empty bowl.Looking up, she saw Zhao Nanyu, who she didn\u2019t know appeared. Her chest was a little stuffy, and she managed to walk to him. Her voice was also a little hoarse. \u201cYou are back.\u201dBefore Zhao Nanyu could speak, Song Luan\u2019s legs and feet suddenly softened, and she fell in his arms. Zhao Nanyu firmly supported her waist.Song Luan seemed to know what he wanted to ask. With a smile, she stopped his question in advance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t stand still.\u201dShe broke away from his arms and walked out.Zhao Nanyu still firmly held her wrist.Song Luan was shocked by his cold and fierce eyes. He held her with so much power that her wrist must have been squeezed hard.Song Luan mumbled, \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was really tired.Even her well-dressed makeup couldn\u2019t cover her haggard face, and there was a gloomy aura around her.Zhao Nanyu loosened his wrists and swept a look at her face. He said in a cold voice, \u201cYour appearance now is not very good. It\u2019s better to leave it to the servants to take care of the child.\u201dSong Luan said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s not a big problem.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t believe what she said. He had a debt in his heart and was reluctant to see her worry about her child\u2019s illness all day long. Zhao Nanyu just wanted to keep Song Luan\u2019s body healthy now.He stretched out his hand, and his cool fingers slowly slipped over her pale cheek. It also gently pulled the scattered hair for her.He urged her in a warm voice, \u201cI know you can\u2019t trust me, but if you do this to take care of him, you will be ill again. If little Zhao knows that you got sick, he will feel very sad. This child has a heavy mind. Even if he is sad, he will not tell you.\u201dSong Luan rubbed her wrist, stared at her toes, and did not answer him.In addition to being tired these days, she also felt that there were some uncomfortable places in her body. Her chest was stuffy and she had short of breath. Her heart and mouth also hurt. It was very similar to the symptoms of when she fainted for the first time. She also blamed herself for taking less medicine some days ago.It\u00a0was only now that Song Luan had reluctantly admitted that\u00a0she had really became a sick seedling, and that\u00a0she couldn\u2019t\u00a0live without medicines.\u00a0She didn\u2019t lift her head, and just said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, please find a reliable servant to look for little Zhao.\u201dZhao Nanyu heard her unhappiness. He squeezed her chin and raised her face. Song Luan\u2019s unhappy face could be seen in\u00a0her straight face. Even her words were less.He sighed, \u201cAh Luan, I am not refusing to let you near the child, but I am worried about your body.\u201dSong Luan knew that the poison in her body couldn\u2019t be control immediately.With his eyes closed, Zhao Nanyu could remember the picture of when he asked Zhao Chao for poison.At the beginning, he didn\u2019t take Song Luan\u2019s life to heart and asked Zhao Chao for the most dangerous medicine that could torture a person. Zhao Chao picked from the cupboard and found a small red bottle and threw it to him. At that time, Zhao Chao laughed and said that he was cruel enough.Zhao Nanyu even took this word as praise. He thought of all the things that Song Luan had done, and only wanted to torture her slowly, rather than kill her all at once, which was too boring. Even he couldn\u2019t hide from the cause and effect.Song Luan looked at Zhao Nanyu with complicated eyes.She suddenly felt that Zhao Nanyu was really worried about her this time, and not for other reasons. And this kind of care was still very useful for Song Luan. \u00a0 In fact, Zhao Nanyu could give her enough security at a critical time.Song Luan thought the last time she was in the palace. She almost thought she would die of pain, and was really afraid. But in the moment when she was hugged by him, the fear that magnified in her heart gradually subsided.She was held in his arms while quietly being coaxed. She cried conspicuously in his arms, and all her grievances and uneasiness dissipated right then.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think much.\u201d Song Luan looked at him with sincere tone.Today, Zhao Nanyu wore a crimson round collar and narrow sleeve robe. There was an exquisite patterns embroidered in the middle of his robe. His waist was decorated with jade belt. His black hair was tied up high, showing his extremely handsome features.At sunset, the yellow golden light passed through the window pane, and the soft light fell on his delicate face, which made him look white and transparent.There was no doubt about the beauty of the male lead. Song Luan had been stunned for several times.\u00a0This time, she may have been seduced by Zhao Nanyu\u2019s beauty. She stood on tiptoe and pecked his lips. Her face was slightly red. \u201cI know you are worried about me. Thank you.\u201dSong Luan took the initiative to kiss him.She blushed, sat down, and pretended to drink a glass of water.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s fingers caressed the place she pecked, his eyes curved with laughter. He licked his lips, squinted at her, and said, \u201cKiss again.\u201dSong Luan did not open her eyes and pretended not to hear.She was just seduced by his beauty\u2026Song Luan rarely took the initiative. Although Zhao Nanyu wanted her to peck him more, he didn\u2019t continue to force her.***The weather gradually turned cool, and the autumn wind was blowing. The ground of the courtyard was covered with golden leaves.The windows of the inner room were tightly closed, so no wind could get in.Little Zhao\u2019s illness began to improve, but Song Luan\u2019s complexion was still as pale as ever, and only after taking tonic did she get better.In this way, Song Luan would never dare to stop the medicine easily again. Now her body was like a bottomless hole, and she could only fill it continuously.Problems such as chest tightness and shortness of breath never appeared after taking the medicine. But her face was still pale.Other people in the family who knew that little Zhao was sick, came to their residence and visited him.\u00a0After Zhao Wenyan returned to the academy, third lady Zhao had time to come see little Zhao. Although she never liked to interfere with the affairs of Zhao Nanyu and his wife, he was also her grandson. If he was ill, she could not help asking.Besides, third lady Zhao still likes this kid. Some of the other children in the family were more lovely and charming than him, but they were not as good-looking as him.Besides, he was the most sensible one. He didn\u2019t cry, nor quarrel, and didn\u2019t get angry with the adults. Third lady Zhao picked some valuable supplements from her warehouse, but was surprised to see Song Luan\u2019s weak appearance. Didn\u2019t she look good the other day? Why was she so haggard?Third lady Zhao thought in her heart for a while, thinking of the love between the two couple. Zhao Nanyu was young and energetic, maybe Song Luan was fooled by Ah Yu in the matter of the bed. In addition, Song Luan was worried about her son\u2019s illness, so this made her thin and weak.She felt that as their nominal mother, she had to say something. She took Song Luan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAh Luan, although I\u2019m happy to see you and your husband mixing oil, you can\u2019t get used to Ah Yu in anything. You have to persuade him when he comes.\u201dSong Luan heard the fog in her head, \u201cAh?\u201dWhen third lady Zhao saw the ignorant expression on her face, she coughed twice and whispered in her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t be coaxed in bed. He\u2019ll be used to everything if you don\u2019t. He needs to understand restraint.\u201dSong Luan blushed and her neck moved awkwardly. She looked rather embarrassed. She said, \u201cI see. Thanks for reminding.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help it! Zhao Nanyu was a beast in bed! Don\u2019t tell him to exercise restraint. As long as she made a sound, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s movements would only get fiercer and fiercer and won\u2019t listen to what she was saying at all.The more third lady Zhao saw and know Song Luan, the more she liked her. She patted Song Luan on the back of her hand and said with concern, \u201cWhen you look after your son, you should not treat your body too harshly. When you gave birth to him, your body became weak by then. You can\u2019t be careless any more.\u201dSong Luan listened to her words, and was very moved. The third lady in front of her was not the same as in the original book. In the book, she was a cold woman, with only her own son in her eyes and heart, regardless of what Zhao Wenyan did.The two were talking, and there was a \u201cdang\u201d sound in between, as if something had fallen to the ground.Song Luan opened the curtain and hurried into the room. It turned out that her son woke up. The child wanted to dress himself, but he accidentally knocked over the candlestick on the desk.Song Luan was relieved and went to pick up the candlestick for him. She smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201dHe just woke up with a red face, and nodded, \u201cMother, I\u2026I was careless.\u201dSong Luan laughed and carried him off the bed. She dressed him up one by one. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dShe began to tease her son with a smile. \u201cYou are mother\u2019s sweetheart. You will always be my son no matter what you do.\u201dSure enough, the little old-fashioned son was red in his ears.Song Luan pinched his face, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go out and meet grandma, shall we?\u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s eyes drooped and his cheeks were hot. \u201cOkay.\u201dThird lady Zhao was also very happy to meet her grandson. She took out the prepared golden sugar and handed it to him, \u201cGood kid.\u201dLittle Zhao thanked her politely, then he was carried to the front yard by grandma Lin. He had to continue getting his pulse checked.As soon as the child left, third lady Zhao went on talking. Before she had finished speaking, she looked at Song Luan\u2019s stomach meaningfully and asked, \u201cHasn\u2019t your stomach moved yet?\u201dSong Luan was dumbfounded for a long time, then she quickly denied, \u201cNo\u2026.\u201dThird lady Zhao sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s been several months. It\u2019s not right.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t lift her lungs at one breath, and her fingers trembled.She knew later that Zhao Nanyu had never let her eat Bozi soup after everything they did in bed. She was lucky enough that she didn\u2019t get pregnant.Song Luan\u2019s brain was in a mess.She begin to guess Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mind. Did he want her to have another one? Otherwise, with his meticulous character, he would not forget such an important thing as Bozi soup.But Song Luan herself had no intention of making another one for him. She was still waiting for a proper time to leave. As long as the Song family does not fall, she could leave safely. Her voice was trembling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, fate will come naturally.\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, third lady Zhao said, \u201cAfter two days, when you are better, you and I will go to flusi to worship Buddha together, and then we will worship Guanyin.\u201dSong Luan was not good enough to refuse the elder\u2019s request, so she had to answer it with a stiff head. \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter having tea and talking for a long time, Song Luan sent third lady Zhao away. She sat by the window and thought for a long time. Still, she thought it was very difficult to drink the soup by herself. She needs people to buy the medicine and decoct it.Song Luan decided to tell Zhao Nanyu about it when he comes back at night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man\u2019s lips were smiling. He looked proud.The windows were half open, and the shouts of peddlers on both sides of the street could be heard in the elegant room.Opposite to him sat a noble man as regal as a magnolia tree.Sixth prince Li Han took a sip of wine, smiled at Zhao Nanyu, and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother can\u2019t wait.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was cold and his brow slightly wrinkled. In recent days, the Queen\u2019s action was more urgent than he thought. She couldn\u2019t wait to arrange her own people in the forbidden army. Her father and brother\u2019s army also secretly went back to the capital.Every move was for the purpose of getting on the throne.Zhao Nanyu pondered for a moment and asked, \u201cWhat is your highness going to do?\u201dLi Han\u2019s eyes were full of smiles. \u201cNaturally, I\u2019m waiting to see a good play.\u201dHis father was in his palace position for more than 30 years. He was cautious and skillful, now he was seriously ill and trapped in the Wenhua hall. It was strange. Maybe the old emperor deliberately designed to test his sons, but didn\u2019t expect the queen to be the first.Zhao Nanyu looked out of the window quietly and said, \u201cThe queen is very anxious.\u201dThe battle for the throne had always been extremely cruel. If you want to rise to a high position, you must have the ability to be calm.Zhao Nanyu guessed that these days the emperor\u2019s reward to sixth prince made the queen disorderly, and triggered her to fight.Li Han raised his head and drank up the remaining wine in the cup, smiling, \u201cYes.\u201dHe seemed to think of something interesting. \u201cAh Yu, your father-in-law showed me his kindness a few days ago. You know that he hated me deeply regarding the food release incident in Xuzhou. He also participated in several of my meeting. Didn\u2019t you talk about your father-in-law?\u201dZhao Nanyu was stunned. After the silence, he said in a cold voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201dLi Han was surprised and said, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why the Lord Song suddenly turned the wind.\u201dZhao Nanyu took a sip of tea and said slowly, \u201cMaybe Lord Song saw something.\u201dLi Han said regretfully, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity. I thought about how to deal with all the sons of the Song family.\u201d He seemed to remember that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s wife was also from the Song family, and Ah Yu still valued her very much. With a smile, he continued, \u201cAh Yu, I didn\u2019t know that you were happy with your marriage.\u201dZhao Nanyu was expressionless and didn\u2019t answer.Li Han was already used to his reticence for a long time. He said to himself, \u201cI remember. No wonder I saw her familiar before. I had seen her. \u201cThe expression on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face finally fluctuated, and Li Han continued, \u201cLast year, on the Shangyuan Festival, I saw her strolling in Huadeng street with the little prince of He\u2019s family. I heard that the little prince of He\u2019s family seemed to be still deeply in love with her.\u201dZhao Nanyu was not in a hurry. He took a sip of tea and looked calm. \u201cThat\u2019s all in the past.\u201dLi Han smiled. \u201cI really admire Ah Yu for your grace. \u201cZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were drooping. There was a sharp flash in the eyes and a sneer on the corner of his lips. He didn\u2019t have much energy. He just didn\u2019t want sixth prince to continue with the joke.It was still early, but Zhao Nanyu was not interested in sitting down. He got up and said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll go back first.\u201dLi Han laughed more vigorously. Tut, the man was angry, but he knew that he must be magnanimous in front of him. Zhao Nanyu was only so rude when he was angry.Li Han didn\u2019t care about his rudeness. \u201cThen I won\u2019t send you.\u201dZhao Nanyu turned around and left.Coincidentally, as soon as he left the teahouse, he turned around and met Song Heqing, Song Luan\u2019s brother.Song Heqing also saw him, came up, and said hello to him.\u201cWhat a coincidence, brother-in-law.\u201dZhao Nanyu eased his face, as he was Song Luan\u2019s brother.Song Heqing shook the fan in his hand. \u201cYou just came out after tea?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNow that you\u2019ve had a drink, hurry home. I won\u2019t bother you much. \u201cSong Heqing heard from the guard that the third young lady had sneaked back home in the clothes of a servant girl. He thought that his sister had made an old mistake and was uneasy to come out and hook up with men. Now Song Heqing urged him to go home. He hoped Zhao Nanyu would have a good look at his sister. If he watched her carefully, she would not have a chance to run out?The Song family was partial and short-sighted.Zhao Nanyu nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll leave first.\u201dSong Heqing quickly waved his hand. \u201cHurry back. Maybe ALuan is waiting for you at home.\u201dZhao Nanyu hooked up the corners of his mouth, and didn\u2019t speak again.Every time he went back home, Song Luan was always busy with her own affairs.\u00a0But on this day, Song Luan was waiting for Zhao Nanyu to come back. She made a good draft in her heart in advance, but she was still guilty.After autumn, the weather became colder and colder.When Zhao Nanyu pushed the door and entered, there was a gust of cold wind.Song Luan was wearing a pomegranate colored coat with a green pleated skirt underneath.She looked at him and stopped talking.Zhao Nanyu looked at her pretty little face and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s voice came out from her throat. It was very small. \u201cHmm..\u201d She looked up at him and said, \u201cThat\u2026that I want to say\u2026these days we have been having a good time with no caution. But\u2026I don\u2019t plan to have another one now. I\u2019m still young to have another child. So I want to tell you, can I have the kitchen cook me a bowl of Bozi soup in the future?\u201dThe atmosphere in the room was oppressive and heavy. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s dark eyes looked directly at her, and he didn\u2019t say a word. The light in his eyes went down a little bit. His face was like a blue jade, and now it was a little cloudy. His lips rose slowly, like a smile, but Song Luan couldn\u2019t see the real smile in his face.Song Luan suddenly felt cold. Her scalp was numb and her teeth were shaking uncontrollably. She tightened her back and tried to stand up straight without losing her momentum.Facing Zhao Nanyu like this, she was just like seeking her own death.But now she had no way back. She had no reason to take back what she said. Song Luan just felt that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s stare at her was a bit frightening.She was patient, calm, and said, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you. Don\u2019t look at me like this. I\u2019m scared.\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his feet to her side for two steps. Song Luan subconsciously retreated, and then stood still. She was afraid to die, so she had to pretend to be an innocent.She cleared her throat. \u201cGive me a word.\u201dSong Luan had made plans. If he didn\u2019t agree, she would find a way to get some medicine.Zhao Nanyu rubbed his fingers and pretended to be careless. He asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you like kids?\u201dSong Luan wasn\u2019t able to answer right away. Of course, she had no resistance to cute children, but that didn\u2019t mean she was willing to give birth for him.Song Luan shook her head. \u201cNo, I just don\u2019t think the time is right. We need to take care of our child now. We can\u2019t think of another one, can we?\u201dZhao Nanyu collected his eyes and seemed as if he was easily persuaded by her, \u201cYou are right, too.\u201dSong Luan was very happy and her eyes were bright. She said, \u201cIs that\u2026\u201dWere they settled!? It should be.Zhao Nanyu touched her face and smiled in a low voice. His words were bare-naked and straightforward. He kissed her earlobe and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t get them in.\u201dSong Luan was so annoyed by his lewd words that she bit his lips and said, \u201cSpeak well.\u201dZhao Nanyu laughed dumbly, and his voice was deep and sweet, \u201cOkay, then it\u2019s up to you.\u201dHer body and bones were not suitable for pregnancy, and it\u2019s the best and most appropriate choice not to have children. But when these words were said from her mouth, Zhao Nanyu still had anger in his heart. However, he usually hide his emotions well, not showing his sadness and joy.As soon as the voice turned, Zhao Nanyu suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019ve answered whatever you said. Is it my turn now.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s intuition told her that it was not a good thing, she barked and asked, \u201cYou\u2026what do you want?!\u201dZhao Nanyu had no plans to do anything with her, but he wanted to say something, so he said, \u201cThe little boy from the He family wrote to you.\u201dSong Luan murmured, \u201cI don\u2019t know. \u201cOf course, she won\u2019t know. All these letters were intercepted by Zhao Nanyu.He touched her head tenderly, took an envelope out of his sleeve, and smiled softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll read it to you now.\u201dSong Luan shivered and sneezed in shock.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s fingers were very beautiful and round. He slowly took the letter out of the envelope and read the handwriting on it, \u201cI can\u2019t see you, my love. I can\u2019t sleep at night.\u201dSong Luan: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWith a pale face, she stretched out her hand and grabbed his wrist, and tried to discuss with him, \u201cDon\u2019t read it.\u201dIt was too sour. Her teeth were going to be sour.Zhao Nanyu waved his hand gently, \u201cIt\u2019s the little boy\u2019s intention, which is naturally to reach your heart.\u201dSong Luan looked at him pitifully. Zhao Nanyu hooked his lips. The arc was slightly cold.His eyebrows seemed to be covered with ice.Song Luan poked her finger to play, thinking that Zhao Nanyu was really to abnormal and perverted, especially his way of reading letters.Very perverted!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhao Nanyu read one letter after another in a low voice.Song Luan\u2019s ears and brain hurt. He enunciated words clearly and read them very slowly, for fear that she couldn\u2019t hear them clearly.After reading, Song Luan watched Zhao Nanyu slowly tore the envelope in his hand to pieces and scattered the scraps of paper on the ground.Zhao Nanyu was so angry after thinking about it. He looked down at Song Luan, who pretended that she didn\u2019t hear anything. His lips turned up, and he laughed. Suddenly, he reached out his hand, grabbed her chin, and said, \u201cHow is it? Did it move you?\u201dSong Luan thought that the male lead\u2019s jealousy was really big. The air was full of sour taste, vinegar and gas. He was afraid that she couldn\u2019t hear it.But she was also wronged. She didn\u2019t write the letters, and didn\u2019t receive any of them.Zhao Nanyu intercepted her letter and flicked her face, which was really stingy.Forced to look up at him, she whispered back, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you.\u201dSong Luan was still very clever. She didn\u2019t face her problems directly and tried to avoid the trouble. However, Zhao Nanyu was not easy to fool. He smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll read it to you again. This time, you should listen carefully.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes were wide and round. Didn\u2019t he tear all the letters?Zhao Nanyu saw at a glance what she was thinking in her heart, and said, \u201cMy memory is not bad. After seeing that many times, I will recite it for you again.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s body was stiff and her heart was shaking. She held out her hand tremblingly. Her thin fingers carefully grasped his clothes, swallowed her saliva, and spoke to him in a friendly voice, \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201dStingy. So petty!Zhao Nanyu looked at her excitedly and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me?\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t stand his hypocritical and sullen ghost appearance. If he gets angry, he will lose his temper directly?!Why did he slowly torture her heart like this? It made her terrified.She looked out, raised her face, and said with a higher voice, \u201cYou are angry.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded, and generously recognized it. He replied, \u201cWell, yes.\u201dSong Luan was innocent when the pot came down from the sky.\u201cI didn\u2019t write to He Run. What are you so angry about?\u201dZhao Nanyu once said to her that he would never mentioned the past, but he often could not control his emotions, especially what sixth prince said today, which he couldn\u2019t forget even if he wanted to.\u201cThen I\u2019m unreasonable.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart suddenly felt a little more guilty. When she thought about it carefully, it was the original owner who took the initiative to hook up with He Run. He Run\u2019s longing for her was also because she always treated him vaguely.In a reasonable sense, it was her fault.Zhao Nanyu loosened her chin, went to his usual place, and sat down. There was a stack of unused white paper on the desk. He picked up the brush on the pen holder, stood at the desk expressionless, and calmly began to practice calligraphy.The clouds on his face was light and breezy.Song Luan probably understood his temper. She made him uncomfortable, in return, he would make her feel bad and upset. He would try his best to beat her in other matters.She walked slowly to him and said, \u201cI promise you, as long as I am your wife, I will never do anything that will make me apologize to you.\u201dWhen Zhao Nanyu smelled her fingers, the black ink dripped on the paper carelessly. He put down his pen. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dWasn\u2019t that enough?Zhao Nanyu sighed softly, thinking that he would be able to hear the words of love from her mouth. In fact, he knew that as long as he did not ask, she would never admit that she liked him.What\u2019s more, even if he asked, Song Luan\u2019s liking didn\u2019t have any weight. It was just the practiced words that she could say with her eyes closed.He grabbed her small hand and took her to his side. Song Luan was held in his arms. His strong hand rests on her waist. \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough\u2026\u201dWhy was he so angry with her? Because she had no heart and no lungs.That night, Zhao Nanyu took her hand and taught her how to practice chinese characters. Song Luan refused for a long time. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t lose a word to her face, and directly said, \u201cYour words are so ugly.\u201dThere was no writing style. She even wrote wrong words.Song Luan couldn\u2019t be blamed for all this. She couldn\u2019t write the characters of this dynasty. The original owner was not a person willing to study hard. She couldn\u2019t recognize even a few words.Zhao Nanyu stood behind her. With her small hands wrapped in his big hands, she wrote in the paper stroke by stroke.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s breathing sound passed her ear, and Song Luan blushed. Her expression and action were not natural.\u201cYou\u2019re not even as good as your son.\u201d Zhao Nanyu teased her.Song Luan was embarrassed by what he said, and just wanted to talk back, but instead listened to Zhao Nanyu talk, \u201cI heard from your brother before that, you never study your lessons well after you went home from school. Your assignments were all written by someone else.\u201d\u201cMy brother didn\u2019t say that.\u201dZhao Nanyu chuckled. \u201cSince you said it\u2019s not true, then you have the final say.\u201dSong Luan thought that Zhao Nanyu was trying to coax her. Her heart was pounding faster and her cheeks were burning. His doting tone made Song Luan feel embarrassed!\u201cDo you and my brother get along well? Why didn\u2019t I know about it before?\u201d Song Luan didn\u2019t remember that the original owner\u2019s older brother and the male lead knew each other.Zhao Nanyu nodded, \u201cNot bad.\u201dIn the past few years, Zhao Nanyu and Song Heqing had seen many times and talked alone more than twice. At that time, Song Luan was not as smart as she was now. She was very disobedient and disliked his lowly birth, so she often ran out to meet with different men.This kind of thing couldn\u2019t be concealed, and Song Luan didn\u2019t seem to hide it. Zhao Nanyu still went his own way despite the wind and rain in the capital.So every time there was a rumor, Song Heqing would always go to find him, or apologized and make more excuse for Song Luan. Over time, Zhao Nanyu heard a lot about Song Luan from Song Heqing\u2019s mouth.Song Heqing was a good brother, but he doted on his sister too much. This was not a good thing.\u201cYour brother also said that you often bullied others when you were young.\u201d\u201cI forgot. Why didn\u2019t you tell me what you were like when you were a child? \u201cZhao Nanyu\u2019s voice was a little heavy. \u201cWhen I was a child, well, I was not very loved like you. \u201cBefore the age of seven, he followed his mother to beg for a living. He was displaced and often bullied. After his mother died, he was picked up by the Zhao family. He had no worries about food and clothing. However, many people laughed at him secretly, and his cousin would smash him with stones.During the Spring Festival, the old lady never prepared his red bag, nor would she leave dinner for him.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s childhood memory was very bad, but he thought that Song Luan must be a spoiled girl who grew up in the palm of her hand.Once upon a time, Zhao Nanyu hated her willful and reckless actions, and hated her noble appearance of not putting anyone in her eyes.Now, he loves her.Yeah, it\u2019s cute.Cute and lovely.Song Luan didn\u2019t continue to ask. She just didn\u2019t bother. She just asked this sentence out of politeness.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s abnormal behavior, wasn\u2019t it because his childhood life was too miserable?She was practicing calligraphy, but later on, she didn\u2019t know what was going on. She didn\u2019t know where she had thrown her brush, because she was abruptly turned to bed by Zhao Nanyu.Since their son got sick, they haven\u2019t made love for a long time.It may be Zhao Nanyu had been a vegetarian for too long, but it was more likely because of her and He Run\u2019s affairs, and he was determined to make her his.Song Luan had learned this lesson many times. Although her tears were useless in front of Zhao Nanyu, his movements would be lighter as long as she cried for pain and pretended to be hurt a little bit.So at first, Song Luan hummed and hawed, \u201cIt\u2019s painful..It hurts\u2026please take care of me. I am physically weak\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu kissed her on the corner of her mouth and seemed to believe her words, \u201cDoes it really hurt? \u201cSong Luan nodded and lied without breathing. \u201cReally.\u201dHearing this, Zhao Nanyu really lightened his movements. He did not fail to see her poor acting skills.He continued in silence. The night was very long, and Song Luan had no strength to move her last two legs.It was not early when Song Luan got up from her bed the next day.The first thing she did after putting her clothes on were to ask grandma Lin to decoct her a bowl of soup.Song Luan\u2019s words could only be obeyed by servants. Grandma Lin had been serving in the Zhao\u2019s residence for a long time and was loyal to her master. But for Song Luan, who was protected by her husband, grandma Lin had a lot of complaints in her heart. From the bottom of her heart, she thought that this woman was not worth treating her well. Now, drinking the bozi soup just so she could avoid having children, grandma Lin felt chilly.Zhao Nanyu came back from the outside after practicing his sword. Song Luan in the room had just swallowed the Bozi soup. Her mouth was bitter. She had eaten two candy before she could disperse the disgusting smell of the medicine in her mouth.Zhao Nanyu silently watched her take medicine and poured her a cup of water. Song Luan took the cup and thanked him softly.Song Luan could see that Zhao Nanyu was in a bad mood. She held up her chin and thought silently that the man seemed to be very unhappy every day, that is, his face was particularly smelly this morning.They had a good breakfast together. Song Luan went to the cubicle as usual to see her son. At last, the child had recovered from his cough. His complexion was rosy and his illness was cured.Song Luan was very happy after seeing it. She planned to cook a bowl of braised pork for him at noon.He had suffered a long time from his disease. These days, he could only eat some light vegetables and porridge, and greasy foods were not allowed. Seeing that his fleshy cheek had lost a lot of weight, it hurt her badly.Recently, she liked to help her son dress up. After dressing him beautifully, she had a sense of achievement in her heart. At first, she wanted to come by herself, but later she was persuaded by little Zhao to let him come.Song Luan put on a red coat for him. It was autumn. She was afraid that the child would freeze. She just put on a thick cloak for herself. The collar was a white fox hair. It was warm to touch.The child\u2019s lips were red and his teeth were white.Song Luan hugged him and took him out. Zhao Nanyu saw little Zhao being hugged by her. His eyes and eyebrows were filled with a happy smile.All of a sudden, he thought, if only he could have another daughter as charming and lovely as Song Luan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let me hold him.\u201dHe took the child from her arms, and little Zhao naturally hugged his neck and shouted, \u201cFather.\u201dZhao Nanyu touched his head. \u201cIs it uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cMmhmm.\u201d Little Zhao was guilty. If he wasn\u2019t ill, his father and mother would not worry about him.Little Zhao buried his head, and his eyes were red. He cried out, \u201cI\u2019m wrong, father.\u201dZhao Nanyu held him quietly, and the tears of the child fell uncontrollably on his shoulder. When little Zhao had cried enough, he said, \u201cBoys should not easily shed tears.\u201dWhen he said this to him, little Zhao burped and wiped the tears on his cheek with his sleeve. His nasal tone was thick. \u201cI won\u2019t cry anymore.\u201dHis father used to say that crying was a sign of weakness. He just couldn\u2019t help it today.Song Luan didn\u2019t notice that he was crying at first because the child cried quietly. She went over and looked at him heartily. Then she took out her handkerchief and wiped his face gently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If you want to cry, you just cry. No one will think you\u2019re weak.\u201dThe couple were very different in educating their children. Zhao Nanyu was very strict with his children in all aspects. As for Song Luan, who was a typical kind mother, children should be well loved. This was the case for boys, especially for girls.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do today. He stayed at home and had lunch with them.Although Song Luan had a good cooking skill, she had only been in the kitchen several times, and each time it was to cook for her son. No one else had this honor, even Zhao Nanyu.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t ask her where the cooking skills came from. He knew that Song Luan used to be a delicate lady who didn\u2019t touch spring water with ten fingers, and no one dared to let her cook in the Song family.According to her proud nature, she was not a person who would wash hands and make soup for others. She had never learned this since she married to the Zhao family.Zhao Nanyu was vaguely aware of what. He guessed some of this, but did not say it.He was very good at observing other people. Song Luan was his wife. He knew what she would be. What\u2019s more, the changes of Song Luan these days were too big and had full of flaws.But these\u2026Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t care. As long as Song Luan was by his side and under his control, it was enough.Zhao Nanyu tasted the braised pork made by her. It was bright and sweet. It was not greasy. It was really delicious.Song Luan had two small bowls of rice, and her stomach was full. She just put down her chopsticks, raised her eyes to Zhao Nanyu, and said to her, \u201cBy the way, mother said that she would take me to Fulu temple to worship Buddha the day after tomorrow. I think we might stay in the temple for another night.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t know about it. He smiled, \u201cMother likes you very much.\u201dThird lady Zhao believed in Buddhism. She went to the temple every month to donate incense money to worship the Buddha. She had never brought Song Luan as her daughter-in-law before.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just loved by people.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Nanyu thought for a moment and said, \u201cCome back early before it gets dark. It\u2019s cold at night in Qinshan mountain. I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t bear it. \u201cHe was too strict that he wouldn\u2019t let her sleep in the temple overnight? She was a little uncomfortable. Song Luan hated being controlled.Later, she realized that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s attitude towards her was a little like that in the book. He was the same to the female lead.Keep her out of the limelight\u2026everything was arranged in advance.That life made people have no chance to breathe.Now that Zhao Nanyu was not yet too serious, Song Luan didn\u2019t want him to develop to that extent that she couldn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201cI\u2019m not that vulnerable. It\u2019s just a night\u2019s stay. It\u2019s not going to be bad.\u201dZhao Nanyu took a sip of tea and retreated half a step, \u201cTake two more servant girls with you.\u201dNo need to guess, these two maids must have been arranged by him\u2026Song Luan frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201dIn \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019, the man\u2019s personality was very fashionable, and his paranoid and black character had won him a lot of popularity. Song Luan remembered that when she was reading, Zhao Nanyu seemed to be a normal person at the early stage, at least he wasn\u2019t over-controlling.When she was a reader, she didn\u2019t like the man\u2019s character very much. Every time she looked at his heart, she felt flustered. She would have given up reading the book long ago if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she was curious to see the ending of this obsessive-compulsive disorder male lead.Song Luan prayed silently in her heart, hoping that the male lead would be more normal. Even if he would blackened, it should not be this time.The next morning, after breakfast, Song Luan and the third lady Zhao set out to Fulu temple in a carriage.Zhao Nanyu said that she could go if she was surrounded by two familiar servant girls. They were usually in her room. Third lady Zhao not only took her alone, but also Yang Ruoyun.Three people in a spacious carriage. It was not too crowded.Today, Yang Ruoyun wore a set of pink skirt, and after putting on makeup, she was more delicate and gentle than usual.It\u2019s an hour\u2019s journey from Zhao\u2019s family to Fulu temple. Third lady Zhao was very energetic. She held her hand and talked all the way. Yang Ruoyun didn\u2019t say a word from the beginning to the end.\u201cYou don\u2019t know, the goddess Guanyin of Fulu Temple is the most effective. The daughter-in-law of Mrs. Cheng came to worship a few days ago. The day before yesterday, she was diagnosed with pregnancy. You must pray well and sincerely.\u201dSong Luan did not open her eyes, because she would guilty when she lies. Third lady Zhao didn\u2019t know that she and Zhao Nanyu had agreed not to have children. Third lady Zhao was also kind-hearted. She would be sad if she knew.\u201cHmmm-hmm. Mother, don\u2019t worry. I will sincerely worship Buddha. \u201cYang Ruoyun suddenly looked at her with a farfetched smile on her face. \u201cI remember that little Zhao is still young. What happened? Is cousin in a hurry?\u201dZhao Nanyu was not in a hurry! In the book, he only had one son.Song Luan guessed that he didn\u2019t like children very much, maybe he thought it was too troublesome, or thought it was enough to have one son.She said to Yang Ruoyun, \u201cYes! Ah Yu is anxious. He wanted to have a child to accompany our eldest son, so he won\u2019t be too lonely. \u201cSong Luan opened her mouth and talked nonsense. It was better to infuriate Yang Ruoyun. This female character really didn\u2019t make her worry.Yang Ruoyun\u2019s smile froze and sank for a moment, and she suddenly said, \u201cYes, my brother\u2019s aunt gave birth to a second child for him the other day. Maybe men want women to open branches for them. They want to scatter their leaves.\u201dEvery word Yang Ruoyun said had her own deep meaning. None of it was nonsense. She reminded Song Luan that she couldn\u2019t give birth. She should also take two concubines to open branches and leaves for Zhao Nanyu.Song Luan was the best at pretending to be stupid. She laughed and pretended that she didn\u2019t understand anything. \u201cIs it? Congratulations to your brother.\u201dYang Ruoyun was angry. Zhao Nanyu had only Song Luan. He hadn\u2019t had a concubine for four years. Now it seemed that he didn\u2019t have such a plan. It was really cheap for Song Luan to dominate such a good man.Third lady Zhao didn\u2019t have any intentions to shove concubines to Zhao Nanyu. The child seemed to be easy to talk, but actually he was rebellious.\u00a0She was afraid that she would send people by his forefoot, and then, would hear bad news in the next moment.It was harmful to others and to her. He was hard to please.At the beginning of the year, the old lady once wanted to do send concubine to him, but was persuaded by third lady Zhao that Zhao Nanyu was already a mature man. If he really liked other girls outside, or wanted to take a concubine, he would do it by himself, and he didn\u2019t need them to intervene at all.It had to be said that third lady Zhao was more thorough than others in this respect.The carriage stopped at the foot of the mountain, and the temple was built on the hillside. The mountain was not high, and Zhong Lingyuxi was beautiful. You can walk a hundred steps to the gate of the temple.The servant girls followed them with their luggage. All the things that they needed to use was packed in the bag. The coachman then drove the carriage back to the residence, and then would pick them up tomorrow.Song Luan took third lady Zhao\u2019s hand and followed her into the temple. The fame of Fulu temple was very famous in the capital. Along the way, they met many well-dressed ladies, all of whom came to pray for God to worship.First, third lady Zhao took her to the main hall to worship the Buddha. Song Luan knelt in front of the Buddha, folded her hands, kowtowed several heads and invested a lot of money.The atmosphere in the palace was tranquil and solemn, and no noise could be heard.Third lady Zhao was still asking for a sign, so Song Luan stayed in the temple, but was suffocated by the incense, so she came out first. In the courtyard on the left side of the main hall sat a Taoist in a robe.It was a strange thing to see a Taoist in the Buddhist temple. What\u2019s more, the Taoist hadn\u2019t been driven out by a monk.It seemed that the Taoist priest also felt her eyes, smiled at her, and asked, \u201cFortune telling?\u201dSong Luan saw his face with clear eyes and sharp facial outline.She approached him somehow, and sat opposite him. She felt nervous for some reason. \u201cThen, please count my future.\u201dThe Taoist stared at her face carefully.\u00a0It\u00a0took a long time before Song Luan heard his voice.\u00a0There was a kind of natural indifference to it. \u201cMadam has a strange fate. I\u2019m afraid that madam will die in the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan really wanted to flip the Taoist\u2019s face in front of her. What was he saying?!She opened her eyes and stared at the Taoist, as if to stare a hole in his body. She took a deep breath and said with dry throat, \u201cYou\u2026I\u2019m very unhappy with what you said.\u201dThe Taoist smiled meaningfully at her, and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t madam aware of this ending long ago?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart was shocked. Her fingernails were deeply embedded in the tender flesh of her palms. This Taoist was very cruel. She pinched herself to make her brain awake.What did this Taoist know?!Song Luan took a breath of cool air and looked at the Taoist\u2019s face carefully. He was very young and quiet. He had a sense of emptiness just like he had a dream.Song Luan understood what he meant. The Taoist\u2019s previous sentence probably referred to the end of the original owner in the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019. He was not wrong. If she followed the line of the original book, she would also die.Her husband and son ended her life with their own hands. She died so tragically.Song Luan\u2019s fingers under her sleeve trembled uncontrollably, and the sound from her throat also quivered. \u201cI dare to ask\u2026would there be a way to escape?\u201dThe young Taoist smiled and said, \u201cNothing can be force, let nature walk by itself. A forced change of life may backfire.\u201dDoes forced change of life meant the way she deliberately avoided the way of the original book? Does she have to go along with the original plot in order to be saved?Song Luan smiled, \u201cI\u2026.\u201dWhat did she want to say?The Taoist priest interrupted her, \u201cMadam is pale and short of Qi. In recent days, madam should also feel stuffy and short of breath, and madam\u2019s heart is aching. Didn\u2019t madam really not think about it?\u201dSong Luan was not stupid. She could understand what he wanted to say. Was this one of the symptoms of her death?But she obviously\u2026.Song Luan straightened her back, but her face became more and more pale. She said hard, \u201cIt\u2019s only for a while. I took the medicine just fine. I hope the Taoist priest doesn\u2019t talk nonsense. \u201cThe young Taoist heard the words and smiled softly. \u201cMadam, please think about it carefully.\u201dSong Luan had no strength to question the identity of the person in front of her. She was sure that the Taoist had never appeared in the whole book, nor was he mentioned. However, his unpredictable words made her believe that he already knew her identity as a transmigrator. He might even know that this world was just the world in a book.Song Luan\u2019s back was dripping with sweat. Only when he reminded her of this, did she remember that when her body gradually improved, she was in a cold war with Zhao Nanyu.The pupil suddenly shrank. At this time, Song Luan realized that she could live longer as long as she kept the original plot.All of a sudden, Song Luan felt that the existence of this book was like her whole life. No matter what the final result was, it was not very good. The only difference was that Zhao Nanyu liked her more than before.Did she really have to be like the original owner to continue to live?The young Taoist seemed to see the doubt in her heart, and became a bit kinder, as he said, \u201cMadam is smart and intelligent, and will surely find life.\u201dSong Luan looked at him and said, \u201cWho are you? \u201cThe young Taoist smiled, \u201cOne day, you will know.\u201dAfter he said those words, he slowly got up to leave, and soon disappeared in the courtyard.Song Luan sat on the stone chair. The autumn wind blew and lightly touched her cheek. Her ears became red by the cold wind, and the coolness in her body had not yet disappeared.Third lady Zhao\u2019s close servant girl panted and trotted to her side.\u201cThe third lady has been looking for you for a long time, but she hasn\u2019t found you anywhere just now. She\u2019s very worried. Now, you are found.\u201dSong Luan looked up at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with my mother looking for me?\u201dThe servant girl replied, \u201cMadam, please go visit Guanyin.\u201dSong Luan took a sigh of relief and stood up tired. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter waiting for a long time in the palace, third lady Zhao saw her coming and asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter? Are you not feeling well?\u201dSong Luan reluctantly smiled, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just tired.\u201d\u201cGo back to your room and have a rest. \u201c\u201cOkay.\u201dGuanyin in Fulu temple was really effective. On the day they came, they met many women who came to repay their vows.Song Luan kowtowed in front of Guanyin statue with three sticks of incense. She closed her eyes and didn\u2019t make a vow. What she thought was what the young Taoist just said.After worshiping Guanyin Bodhisattva, Song Luan was ready to go back to the wing room for rest. She happened to meet two monks outside the hall. Her heart moved, and she went up to salute the two monks and immediately asked, \u201cLittle monk, are there any young Taoists in the temple?\u201d\u201cThis is a Buddhist temple. How could there be a Taoist?\u201dSong Luan was in a trance for a while. Who did she just see?She thought, in her bitterness and pleasure, that such an immeasurable superior was mysterious.She whispered thanks and went back to the wing in a daze.The room prepared in the temple was very simple. Song Luan washed her face and climbed onto the bed. She sat in the corner against the wall with her legs crossed. She carefully thought over the last words of the young Taoist.Song Luan wanted to understand the boundary between the cause of the ending. As long as she did not show too much difference from the original owner in front of Zhao Nanyu, it should be regarded not collapsing from her character.It was cold in the mountain at night. Song Luan felt warm after covering two quilts. She couldn\u2019t breathe because of the heavy quilt pressure. Song Luan had not dreamed for a long time. That night, she dreamed of the woman she had dreamed of before.She laid on the bed, sick. Her once beautiful face was gloomy and her bright eyes were lifeless.She was wearing Song Luan\u2019s favorite pomegranate skirt.Unlike the previous dream, Zhao Nanyu in this dream was haggard, and was skinny.He hugged the woman on the bed and leaned closer to her ear, murmuring something indifferently.Song Luan felt that Zhao Nanyu was about to cry. His eyes were almost full of distortion, violence and sadness. He didn\u2019t look like a normal person anymore.The woman lying on the bed opened her mouth and said a word to him. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s body was almost petrified.Song Luan actually saw his tears fall.He was very depressed.When Song Luan woke up, she raised her hand to wipe her face and found that she had also cried. She knew that the woman in the dream was herself, not the original owner.Probably after her death, the body gradually corroded and swallowed.This strengthened Song Luan\u2019s decision to go according to the original plot. She only needed to show the original owner\u2019s sloppy and unreasonable character.As for making Zhao Nanyu wear a green hat, she would not do it.Song Luan looked out of the window. It was just dawn. She climbed out of the quilt and cleaned herself. Then she was led by the little monk in the temple to have a fast meal.After having breakfast, they were going back to the residence.When going down the mountain, Song Luan met an acquaintance, her good sister Song Yu.The two sisters met in the Palace last time. After that, Song Luan never saw her again. Last time, aunt Lin told her that Song Yu would marry.Looking at the present appearance of Song Yu, she couldn\u2019t see that she was going to marry soon.Song Yu was thin and she almost didn\u2019t recognize her. Her temperament was dull and she didn\u2019t get angry.When they passed each other, Song Yu looked at her resentfully.\u201cThird sister, what a coincidence.\u201dSong Luan thought she would not say hello to her. She smiled and said, \u201cDoes sister come to pray too?\u201d\u201cYes. What about sister? \u201c\u201cI\u2019m just like you. \u201cSong Yu said coldly, \u201cThen I wish sister all the best. \u201cSong Luan politely replied, \u201cSo do you.\u201dShe thought that the eyes of Song Yu seemed like she wanted to kill her. Song Luan thought that Song Yu really hated her.Song Yu really hated her. She gnashed her teeth and looked at her back when she left the palace.After leaving the palace, she went home and her stomach hurt so much that she couldn\u2019t see well for three days. Finally,\u00a0her\u00a0parents rushed to help her, and intuition told her that it was Song Luan\u2019s intention to revenge her and set her up.It was almost noon before the carriage stopped at the gate of the Zhao\u2019s residence.Song Luan didn\u2019t sleep well last night. She just slept on the carriage for a while.She was in a good mood. Seeing that no one was around, she stretched comfortably.Before she went back to the yard, she saw a little dumpling head come out.Song Luan had something in mind, and didn\u2019t smile too much when she saw little Zhao. She squatted down in front of him and touched his head. \u201cAre you coming out to pick up mother?\u201dLittle Zhao nodded. He asked her to open her hand and hold him.He was shy and seldom took the initiative in front of her. It seemed that after his illness, the relationship between the mother and the son became better.Song Luan lifted him up with a smile. \u201cGood boy. You\u2019re not hurt anymore.\u201dThe gloom in her chest had dissipated. Her son was such a warm baby.He had been clinging to her for an afternoon, even sleeping. Song Luan had no time to think about other things, let alone to mourn.In the evening, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t go back to the residence. Song Luan and her son had a meal together. After eating, she coaxed her son to sleep.She gently put the child down on the small bed in the compartment, pinched the quilt corner for him, and sat in front of the bed for a long time. Song Luan then slowly withdrew.She didn\u2019t know when Zhao Nanyu came back. He took off his outer clothes. When he heard her footsteps, he turned around and looked back, and asked, \u201cIs it fun in the temple?\u201dSong Luan remembered what the Taoist said.She pouted. \u201cI did not go there to have fun.\u201dZhao Nanyu had just come back from the outside, but his hands were still cold, so he dared not go forward to hold her hands.He was acutely aware that Song Luan\u2019s mood seemed to be very low. He asked casually, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s wrong with the temple?\u201dSong Luan lowered her head and watched her toes play. Her eyes were red gradually. The word \u2018death\u2019 was engraved in her mind and couldn\u2019t be removed.She lowered her eyes, and silently shed tears. Droplets of waters fell on her sleeves, like running water crawling down over her whole face.She silently cried.Zhao Nanyu thought something was wrong. He lifted her face up, gently wiped the tears on her cheeks with his fingers, \u201cWho bullied you?\u201dSong Luan really didn\u2019t want to cry in front of him, but she couldn\u2019t control herself. She was very aggrieved and very sad.She sniffed, her voice changed a tone, and she could hardly speak clearly. \u201cI read a book at home this afternoon, and the people in that book were so miserable, so I was very unhappy.\u201dZhao Nanyu was skeptical, but he still coaxed her and said, \u201cThe books are all fake.\u201dSong Luan cried even louder when he heard his voice. She couldn\u2019t breathe. What Zhao Nanyu said made her even more sad. What happened in this book was all true.Zhao Nanyu thought that what she liked most was the poor appearance of her tears. Now she couldn\u2019t stop crying. She was very sad. He hugged her and coaxed her patiently, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself by crying.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes were red and swollen. She couldn\u2019t stop.Zhao Nanyu was helpless and carried the woman to the bed. \u201cYou can\u2019t feel better tonight if you cry again.\u201dSure enough, Song Luan immediately stopped.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want to threaten her, but according to her crying method, it was estimated that Song Luan would soon faint from crying.He went out for a while, and when he came back, his face looked a lot heavier.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t believe that Song Luan was crying just because she read a book, but he only asked the people who watched over her just now. Nothing happened in the temple and no one bullied her.He reluctantly put down the confusion in his heart, Zhao Nanyu went back to the house and raised his hand to put out the candle.Song Luan felt much better after venting out. She rolled the quilt and faced the wall. Before long, she felt that there was a person beside her.Zhao Nanyu fell asleep beside her, put out his hand around her waist, and pulled the woman out of the corner. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s fingers were very restless, and he untied the belt on her waist three or two times.As he was about to do something, Song Luan turned around and looked at him.She decided to carry forward the arrogant character of the original owner from today on, and work hard! It was better to do this than to die. It was better than dying of death.Moreover, Song Luan already had the confidence to do this, because Zhao Nanyu liked her. So Song Luan fluently thought that even if she was indulgent and unreasonable, the male lead would not want kill her.Song Luan bravely clapped his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201dThe bright moonlight shone on her beautiful face, her eyes were still slightly red, and Zhao Nanyu remembered her face in his heart.Zhao Nanyu licked her lips and her waist even harder. He kissed her lower lip. He didn\u2019t take her words to heart, but took them as a kind of interest. He smiled gently, \u201cAh Luan is so fierce, I\u2019m afraid.\u201dSong Luan felt the dullness in her chest dissipate a lot when she pushed him away.It seems that being fierce was effective.She\u2019s really going to take the road of unruly and willful lady.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan was a gentle and timid girl before she transmigrated. She seldom quarreled with others when she was a child, and so, her elders praised her as a good girl.Song Luan thought that she had been very fierce to Zhao Nanyu. In fact, in his eyes, she was not even near from being fierce, more like a coquettish kind, and this aroused his interest more.Zhao Nanyu instead liked her coquettish appearance more than her indifference.The cold lips tasted her clavicle, and his hand strongly embraced her thin waist. Zhao Nanyu sniffed the fragrance of her body and sighed, \u201cLuan Bao is so fragrant.\u201dHe remembered that Song Luan\u2019s mother called her with that. At that time, Zhao Nanyu remembered it silently, and when he felt this strong surge of wanting Song Luan more, he called out her name \u2018Luan Bao\u2019When Song Luan heard him call her name, she had goose bumps on her arms. The two normal words appeared very sorrowful from Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mouth.The atmosphere in the hibiscus tent was very ambiguous. He continued to call her name while biting her ear. It seemed that he was forcing her to give a response. Her toes curled up and Zhao Nanyu find her very cute. Song Luan was flustered. Could she still run?She instinctively shrank back. Song Luan wouldn\u2019t be his opponent forever in the book, so for now, she still couldn\u2019t run.But, she couldn\u2019t escape without being bullied.Song Luan\u2019s face was angry, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Why can\u2019t you be reasonable? You touching me is really annoying.\u201dHer face was not intimidating at all, and her tone was soft. Zhao Nanyu was amused by her appearance. \u201cIs Luan Bao playing coquetry with me?\u201dSong Luan fiercely replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m murdering you!\u201dCouldn\u2019t you see? Wasn\u2019t it obvious enough? This man was really shameless.Song Luan couldn\u2019t help but stretched her hand to push him, \u201cAnd don\u2019t call me Luan Bao, I don\u2019t like it.\u201dWhen he called out her name with a very pleasant voice, and he even deliberately extended the ending of her name, which made her tremble.Zhao Nanyu asked her in a good temper, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cMy mother can only say that name.\u201d Song Luan, who was still suffering, suddenly opened her eyes and smiled, \u201cAre you going to be my mother?\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows and chuckled, \u201cYou have a sharp teeth and a sharp mouth.\u201dZhao Nanyu kept calling her intimate name the whole night. Song Luan couldn\u2019t help but listen. She couldn\u2019t block his mouth, so she instead kicked and pinched him, but this was regarded as sentiments between husband and wife.It was a good weather the next day.Song Luan laid half dead on the bed and thought it over carefully with her eyes open. Last night, she shouldn\u2019t have said that he wanted to be her mother, because this made Zhao Nanyu unhappy and even retaliated.At this time, even when she woke up, she couldn\u2019t move. It was sour and soft.After a long time, Song Luan sighed deeply and sat up from the bed. Grandma Lin heard the sound and came in to find her clothes.Song Luan put on her clothes. After washing, the servant girl outside came into the house with breakfast.Song Luan had developed a special taste. She didn\u2019t like sweet or greasy food in the morning, so she had always drank porridge these days.However, in the recent months, she felt that the taste of white porridge seemed to have changed. There was a slight sweetness in the porridge before, but now she couldn\u2019t taste any of that flavor.Song Luan had two bowls of porridge before she filled her stomach enough. After breakfast, she found that Zhao Nanyu had already returned to the residence.Zhao Nanyu was in a good mood. He went in and changed his clothes, and said to her, \u201cDo you want to go riding?\u201dSong Luan was walking around the room when she heard this, she immediately stopped, her eyes brightened, and nodded, \u201cYes!\u201dShe was ashamed to admit but she hadn\u2019t ridden a horse yet.And Song Luan remembered that the original owner could ride a horse well.Every autumn, the emperor would personally preside over the equestrian competition. Noble young men and women were invited to participate.In the book, there was a sentence that said, \u2018Song Luan won the title in the women\u2019s category.\u2019Zhao Nanyu patted the back of her head and said, \u201cGo change your clothes. I will take you to the horse farm.\u201dSong Luan then went to change into her riding clothes. Last night, her plans to fight Zhao Nanyu were all eaten by dogs.Song Luan was dressed in a red riding suit. Her hair was all set up. Her facial features stood up with elegance. She was gorgeous and beautiful.When she arrived at the horse farm, Song Luan found that it wasn\u2019t only the two of them, but also sixth prince and Ayun, who was beside him.A Yun was warm and approachable. She also took the initiative to talk to her without putting on airs.\u201cMiss Song, I heard that you are good at riding. I don\u2019t know if I have the honor to see you today.\u201dSong Luan said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t ride a horse, but maybe when she gets on the horse back, her instinct would probably kick in.A Yun hid behind the sixth prince timidly. She seems to be afraid. She was timid and had a small voice.She leaned out her small head from behind sixth prince, looked at her with concern, and asked in a low voice, \u201cMiss Song, are you well?\u201dSong Luan liked A Yun very much. The little girl was naive and lovely. When Song Luan saw her, She wanted to be protect her. But it was a pity that she didn\u2019t see her name in the original book and didn\u2019t know her final ending. Maybe Song Luan forgot about the plot, or maybe she didn\u2019t read carefully.Song Luan didn\u2019t realize it herself, but she had been looking at A Yun with eyes of pity and sympathy. After sixth prince ascended the throne and became the new emperor, the queen became Xuan Zhengqing, his former imperial concubine. Moreover, the new emperor had several beloved imperial concubines in his harem.To put it another way, if A Yun was the woman locked up by the new emperor, she was also very miserable. Her life was only a few decades, and had no chance to escape from the shackles in her life.Song Luan had only seen A Yun twice, and each time she could only see her unreserved love for the sixth prince.She smiled. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine now. Were you scared last time?\u201dA Yun looked like she was going to cry last time.A Yun nodded her head in a funny way. She was really scared. She thought miss Song would die of pain.Zhao Nanyu was not happy with how long she chatted with unimportant people, so he dragged her to pick horses.Song Luan picked a gentle looking foal from the stable. She patted the foal on the hip and said, \u201cI\u2019ll pick this horse.\u201dZhao Nanyu took a look and raised his eyebrows. He was surprised. \u201cAre you sure?\u201dSong Luan coughed twice uneasily and said, \u201cHe\u2019s the best.\u201dFor this reason, Zhao Nanyu could not laugh or cry. He thought that according to Song Luan\u2019s temperament, he wouldn\u2019t choose this young foal.But that\u2019s fine. He wouldn\u2019t worry about her bumping.Song Luan was picked up by Zhao Nanyu, which made her feel a bit embarrassed. Her legs were short, and she couldn\u2019t climb high enough.At first, Zhao Nanyu stood by to watch her make fun of herself. When her patience wore thin, he held her on the horse back with the smile of his lips.Maybe it\u2019s the instinct of the body, because Song Luan could control him well when she got on the horse, but she didn\u2019t dare to ride very fast. She just around the horse farm for two rounds.Zhao Nanyu was right behind her. He was dressed in a black riding suit. His handsome face looked heroic. The sun fell on his fair face, adding a bit of nobility.After two turns, Song Luan felt tired and almost twisted her feet when she jumped off the horse.It seems that sixth prince and A Yun hadn\u2019t started riding yet. A Yun looked pale and scared. She couldn\u2019t let go from holding sixth prince\u2019s arms.Sixth prince didn\u2019t know what to say to A Yun who was scared to tears. He looked at her red eyes and her pitiful appearance. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh loudly, and immediately held her face kiss her.Song Luan thought that this sixth prince was really a bad man.A Yun had no title to follow him, but she followed him knowing the unforeseen future.The new emperor in the original book was not pleasant. There were countless beauties in his harem. However, the emperor\u2019s heart was indifferent. The woman who he would loved to the heaven\u2026would be killed in the next instant.Song Luan thought of Zhao Nanyu again. In fact, he was not such a good person. Before he became a powerful minister, he was a gentle young man. When he had the power of life and death, he began to uproot the dissidents in the court. Those who opposed his regime, one by one, were uprooted. Sometimes even the whole family couldn\u2019t stand against him.His cruelty gradually appeared. At first, some courageous ministers joined hands to destroy him, but unfortunately, the new emperor was too fond of Zhao Nanyu and never cared about the lives he slaughtered.Zhao Nanyu was very vengeful. He wrote down the names of the people who took part in his adversity. He picked them up mercilessly. As time passed, no one dared to provoke him again.Zhao Nanyu was violent and cruel, but his methods were still effective in Dali temple. The Treasury gradually filled up and peoples\u2019 life improved.Those who hate him couldn\u2019t wait to kill him, and those who support him would be willing to die for him.Zhao Nanyu appeared behind her and put his long arms on her shoulder, \u201cTired?\u201dSong Luan retracted her eyes. She had a slight trouble breathing, \u201cYes, I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t want to ride.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go back and rest early.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want.\u201d She raised her chin slightly and said angrily.Why should she go back when she had just gone out? This time, it was not that she intended to copy the original owner\u2019s temper, but that she was really grumpy inside. She was upset at seeing and hearing him.Song Luan thought about it. Maybe it was because her monthly period was coming soon. She was in such a bad mood.Zhao Nanyu was always indifferent. Song Luan had never seen anyone who could cover up his emotions.\u201cYou\u2019re being childish again.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t want to go back so early. I want to buy jewelry. Other girls have beautiful jewelry and beautiful clothes. I don\u2019t have much.\u201dSong Luan was lying. She couldn\u2019t wear all her clothes. As for jewelry, she had already picked some in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s warehouse.Zhao Nanyu was also used to her temper. He nodded thoughtfully, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take you to buy it.\u201dSong Luan suddenly had the illusion that she was being spoiled by him, like he was his daughter.Sixth prince and A Yun were not interested in staying in the race course anymore, so they went to the downtown together, but sixth prince seems to have other things to do, so he didn\u2019t join.A Yun was reluctant to let Song Luan go. Before she left, she held her hand. \u201cMiss Song, can I come to see you later?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s pupil shrank. After a long time, she returned to her mind. She was in a trance and answered, \u201cYes.\u201dSixth prince put his arms around A Yun\u2019s waist, and his expression was not very pleasant. He said deeply, \u201cYou like her!\u201dA Yun bit her lips and didn\u2019t speak.After they left, Song Luan was still in a trance. Just like Huai Jin, when A Yun held her hand, many unseen pictures came into her mind.Gorgeous palaces, golden cages, and a pitiful woman.That woman was A Yun.Even if Song Luan knew this, she couldn\u2019t do anything.Zhao Nanyu saw her look gloomy and grabbed her finger to play. \u201cAren\u2019t you happy to buy jewelry?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t make a sound. Zhao Nanyu took her to the best jewelry shop in the capital. She childishly wanted to empty his money bag and bought many hairpins and earrings at one go.When Zhao Nanyu saw how much she had taken, his eyelids did not falter. When they went out of the shop, he commented with a smile, \u201cThese are not very good.\u201dSong Luan held her bag of jewels and stared at him. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say it earlier!?\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled and didn\u2019t reply. Of course, he won\u2019t say it. Song Luan\u2019s thoughts of leaving him hadn\u2019t stopped. The cheap and worthless jewels they bought were also very good. They would not be worth much in the future.He stopped and mumbled, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to disturb your interest.\u201dSong Luan snorted, \u201cYou are mean!\u201dZhao Nanyu bent his lips and smiled, \u201cShall I give you my warehouse key?\u201dEverything in the storehouse couldn\u2019t be pawned. Even if Song Luan took it, she could only admire it, since it won\u2019t be changed into money.***In a word, Zhao Nanyu made it impossible for her to leave. It was a good way to cut off her wealth.Why not? Song Luan was not a polite person either. She stretched out her hand and said, \u201cYes, please give it to me.\u201dZhao Nanyu held her small hand. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you when we arrive home.\u201dSong Luan believed his words.It was evening when they went back to the residence. Old lady Zhao suddenly asked them to go over for dinner.There was no family celebrations today, so Song Luan felt strange. The old lady clearly didn\u2019t like the two of them. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t want to see them. How could she suddenly ask them to accompany her for dinner?Song Luan had a sudden brain shortage and her heart became uneasy.Women\u2019s instincts were surprisingly accurate. The old lady did not have a good heart.The old lady put on a majestic face. The three people had just finished their meals. She raised her eyes, swept their faces, and paused, \u201cI looked for you today to tell you something.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked indifferent, \u201cPlease say it.\u201dThe old lady took a sip of tea and said, \u201cI want little Zhao to live in my courtyard.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face was distorted by the old lady\u2019s words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan originally wanted to endure it, thinking that she was an elder and shouldn\u2019t have conflict with her, but old lady Zhao didn\u2019t seem to be joking. The old lady really wanted to take her son to the main court.What was the reason? She and Zhao Nanyu only had little Zhao as their child. Furthermore, they were still alive to take care of their son. How could this old lady Zhao put forward such an impertinent request?Song Luan straightened up, her reasoning still intact, but her voice was still a little unsteady. \u201cGrandma, little Zhao already lives here in the house. If you want to see him, you can ask the maidservant to lead him to you.\u201dOd lady Zhao sat in front of them with her face taut and heavy. \u201cI mean to bring little Zhao to my side and let him live in my courtyard.\u201dSong Luan was mad. It was true that old lady Zhao frequently meets with little Zhao, but she didn\u2019t have to do such a thing as robbing children, did she?\u201cGrandmother, Ah Yu and I have only one child.\u201d\u201cYou? If you and Ah Yu are good parents, will I want to take him to my side? I haven\u2019t had a good day with you. Your son was seriously ill a few days ago. Have you been a good mother to him?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s chest was filled with rage. Finally, her she couldn\u2019t control it, so she blurted out, \u201cGrandmother is really confident. It seems that after you take him, he won\u2019t get sick in his whole life.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t know how insidious and sour she was when she said this.Old lady Zhao hadn\u2019t seen Song Luan like this for a long time. She thought she had changed her behavior in this period of time, but never really expected that she didn\u2019t have any progress.The old lady pointed to Song Luan and said, \u201cI\u2019m kind enough to point out your wrong behavior, and yet you mock me. You don\u2019t respect your elders. You have no manners. No one will expect you to teach good values to your son!\u201dSong Luan took a deep breath. \u201cGranddaughter-in-law spoke to grandmother-in-law very well, but this grandmother refused to listen. Grandmother says she is blunt, but granddaughter-in-law just told the truth.\u201dThird lady Zhao hadn\u2019t won the upper hand in Song Luan for several times in recent years. Unlike other daughters-in-law, Song Luan had been spoiled growing up since she was a child. Her parents and her brother doted on her. She had a rebellious disposition, but no one had ever paid attention or corrected this behavior in the Song family.Old lady Zhao frequently quarreled with her in the early years, and she would punish her after quarreling. But this person was not willing to accept her punishment.Song Luan beat Zhao Nanyu to give up her idea in a rage, but the old lady said it many times. Zhao Nanyu was only listened.\u201cI just want to ask if you accept to let little Zhao stay in my courtyard.\u201dSong Luan tightened her mouth, but did not reply.\u201cWhat about you!?\u201dSong Luan was angry in her heart. She refused to answer her questions. Weren\u2019t the answers clearly laid out? Why should the old lady ask again?Old lady Zhao was stunned by her dead state of ignoring her. She pointed to her with her trembling hands, \u201cI tell you, the old man Zhao also has this thought in his heart. If you are not willing, you can\u2019t help it.\u201dThey like little Zhao especially because he is intelligent. It was true that old man Zhao thought about it, but because Zhao Nanyu and Song Luan only had one child, they never mentioned it.Song Luan said, \u201cYou are determined to rob my child, aren\u2019t you?\u201dShe was really rude. She poked every word on the old lady\u2019s face. Old lady Zhao raised her hand and was about to slap Song Luan\u2019s cheek, but Zhao Nanyu stopped her hand in mid air, with a light face. \u201cGrandmother, calmed down.\u201dThe old lady snorted, took back her hand, and asked coldly, \u201cYou want to protect her? Haven\u2019t you seen what she did to you in the past?\u201d\u201cAh Luan is the wife of your grandson. It is natural that he wants to protect her.\u201d Zhao Nanyu replied without hesitation. The old lady couldn\u2019t find any fault from his words.The old lady thought it would go well. Although Zhao Nanyu loved his son, he was busy with court duties and didn\u2019t have much time to bring him at home. As for Song Luan, old lady Zhao had never seen her love towards her child ever since litte Zhao was born. She wondered if Song Luan had been hit by a devil in this period of time, and suddenly changed her temper.Now it seems that Zhao Nanyu and Song Luan wouldn\u2019t agree.The old lady thought of this in a whim. Few of her grandchildren had families, and they even had fewer children. It\u2019s hard to avoid loneliness when people are old, and little Zhao who she knew was obedient and beautiful pleased her.From her heart, the old lady thought that it was much better for little Zhao to follow her than to live with Song Luan. She would not be inferior to him in food, clothing, housing, and transportation.How could she know that this husband and wife pair was so disrespectful.Old lady Zhao didn\u2019t want to open her eyes any longer. She didn\u2019t even want to look at Zhao Nanyu. Every time she sees him, she always remembers his mother who made the Zhao family lose face.She said in a cold voice, \u201cSince you look at me with annoyance, go back now.\u201dSong Luan was eager to leave at once. Just after she turned around and stepped forward, she was dragged back by Zhao Nanyu.He patted her on the back of the hand peacefully and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dZhao Nanyu turned his head and smiled at old lady Zhao in a good temper. The smile in his eyes were cold. \u201cGrandmother, you came and took little Zhao today, so we will take the child and leave immediately. We will not pollute your eyes.\u201dLittle Zhao was brought to the main courtyard by old lady Zhao and her servants, and before Zhao Nanyu came back, Old lady Zhao just coaxed the child to sleep.The news spread quickly. old lady Zhao thought Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t know about it. She guessed that he had many eyes hidden in the residence.Thinking of this, the light in the old lady\u2019s eyes was cold, \u201cThe child just fell asleep.\u201dZhao Nanyu did not change his face. \u201cThis grandson will go and wake him up.\u201d\u201cAre you determined to oppose me?\u201d\u201cThis grandson don\u2019t dare.\u201dThe old lady was not polite to him, and her voice suddenly snapped, \u201cChunzhi, stop him!\u201dChunzhi immediately stopped him in front of the door. Zhao Nanyu narrowed his eyes and kept silent for a moment. He was not polite at all. He kicked the person openly and directly broke into the inner room.Just now, Chunzhi\u2019s foot was hard and heavy. He couldn\u2019t get up for a long time after he was kicked. He didn\u2019t dare to stop Zhao Nanyu.The third young master\u2019s ferocious appearance was rare, which frightened everyone.Little Zhao fell asleep and hadn\u2019t woke up even after the big commotion. Zhao Nanyu picked up the child, took Song Luan by the other hand, and then went to the old lady, who was pale with anger. He said respectfully, \u201cThis grandson will leave first.\u201d\u201cViolent, Presumptuous.\u201dBesides these two words, the old lady couldn\u2019t say anything else.Song Luan was led out by him. She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. She thought Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t dare to contradict the old lady. She didn\u2019t expect him to kick the person first, and then take little Zhao directly.Song Luan lowered her head, coughed twice, and said, \u201cAlthough this is not a good sentence, I still want to say it. \u201cZhao Nanyu listened attentively. \u201cTell me, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see that old lady crumble.\u201dSong Luan realized the pleasure of willfulness. She felt comfortable all over without any guilt. She added in silence, \u201cI\u2019m so angry!\u201dProblems of chest tightness and shortness of breath were gone.Zhao Nanyu chuckled. He couldn\u2019t help but pinched her face. \u201cNaughty.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s skin was white and tender. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s strength was great. He had gather all his strength and pinched her cheeks thoughtlessly, which made her face ache. She waved his hand angrily.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you pity me at all?!\u201dWhen he kisses her, it\u2019s like eating her. In bed, he often want to eat her alive. It\u2019s really annoying.Zhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t pity you enough?\u201dSong Luan pointed to her neck, opened her collar and traces of what he did last night appeared before his eyes. \u201cThis is pity? You are shameless.\u201dLooking back on last night\u2019s incident, she blushed and didn\u2019t want to continue to say these obscene words. Instead, she turned to another topic and said, \u201cWhy do you reject the old lady Zhao\u2019s offer of taking care of little Zhao? Thought he never liked you, she was willing to help you with your children.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart was straight and quick, and she said what she had in mind.Zhao Nanyu sighed and felt helpless for her, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let my grandmother take our son.\u201dThis is what the man said. Of course, Song Luan chose to believe him.Back to the Huai Shui residence, Zhao Nanyu put his sleeping son on the bed and told the maidservant to fetch water.Little Zhao gradually woke up, blinked and found that his mother was right in front of him. He called softly, \u201cMother.\u201dSong Luan listened to the soft and sweet call, and her heart felt softer. She sat beside the bed, touched her son\u2019s face, bent her eyes, and said, \u201cWake up? \u201cSince little Zhao just woke up, his nasal sounded heavy, his voice was waxy, sweet and cute. He slowly explained to her, \u201cI\u2026I fell asleep in my grandmother\u2019s house by accident.\u201dHe wanted to come back this afternoon, but his grandmother refused to let him go.\u201cWell, mother knows.\u201d Song Luan propped up her chin and asked him, \u201cDo you like grandma?\u201dLittle Zhao lowered his head, as if unwilling to answer her question.Song Luan then said, \u201cTell your mother the truth. You can\u2019t lie. Your mother won\u2019t blame you.\u201dSure enough, little Zhao shook his head honestly. His grandmother was very strict. She didn\u2019t laugh or get close to him. Besides, little Zhao knew that her grandmother preferred his two other cousins.Song Luan laughed happily. \u201cYou are really my good son.\u201dWhen Zhao Nanyu saw Song Luan\u2019s silly look through the screen, she didn\u2019t know how beautiful she was. Her eyes were brighter than the stars in the sky.Zhao Nanyu was naked, his black hair like silk spread on his straight back, and a few drops of water flowed down his face like the moon. He approached Song Luan slowly, and held her hand, just playing with nothing.Zhao Nanyu asked, \u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201dSong Luan hummed, \u201cWon\u2019t tell you.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t continue to ask, but only continued playing with her fingers. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to say it, it\u2019s okay.\u201dLittle Zhao didn\u2019t get a chance to sleep with his mother that night. He even began to miss his illness. At that time, his mother accompanied him to sleep, and his father wouldn\u2019t stop him. But now, he couldn\u2019t.Little Zhao didn\u2019t mention that he wanted to sleep with his mother, because he knew his father wouldn\u2019t agree.Because Song Luan ran twice in the horse farm and fought with the old lady Zhao today, she felt tired and immediately went to bed.Her sleeping face was very relaxed.She laid on the bed with disordered clothes.Zhao Nanyu covered the quilt for her in silence, and straightened her body.She slept with his arms around her.At noon the next day, Song Luan found out that old lady Zhao was ill. Everyone in the house said that she had given the old lady a bad breath.Song Luan felt wronged.She didn\u2019t think that a woman with a heart of stone like the old lady Zhao would be sickened by her words, but her quarrel with old lady Zhao last night reached the ears of old man Zhao. He is a a man of great etiquette, so after hearing it, he became angry.He directly ordered the servant to take Song Luan to the ancestral hall. When Song Luan arrived, she saw Zhao Nanyu already kneeling in front.Old man Zhao\u2019s face was as black as the bottom of a pot.\u201dAh Yu, you really let me down. Why did you contradict your grandmother!\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t care to explain in front of his family. His face was light, looking as if it didn\u2019t bother him. He said, \u201cThis grandson is willing to solely accept all the punishment. Ah Luan\u2019s body is too weak to bear the family rules.\u201dOld man Zhao glanced at Song Luan coldly and snorted, \u201cIf she is weak, how can she have the energy to disrespect the elders!? I tell you, there is no such reason! Without fear of punishment, she wouldn\u2019t remember her wrong deeds.\u201dSeveral young men with long whips stood in the ancestral hall. The whips were thin and long. Being hit by those whips would be painful.Song Luan was scared when she saw it. If she was beaten by this thing, she would return to the soil of the earth!Zhao Nanyu straightened up and said in a deep voice, \u201cThis grandson will suffer the punishment on her behalf.\u201d\u201cWell, grandfather won\u2019t stop you.\u201d Mr. Zhao had no good face. \u201cForty times and nothing less.\u201dSong Luan jumped up and shivered. Before she could speak, Zhao Nanyu touched her hair and smiled softly at her. \u201cGo out, don\u2019t look.\u201dSong Luan was about to cry. She was sad and sour.She was finally taken out of the temple. Even from where she was, she could hear the sound of the whip. Song Luan sobbed silently.She didn\u2019t expect that Zhao Nanyu would deliberately take the punishment.Zhao Nanyu knew that the most important etiquette for the Zhao\u2019s family is to respect the elders. But even knowing this, he still rebelled against his grandmother last night.The bitter tears that Song Luan silently shed just now showed that she was distressed.Zhao Nanyu closed his eyes and thought quietly that this was good. Her tears made him feel good.Song Luan was like a pet caught by the hunter. She wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the trap he gradually set.T/N: this part is so sweet\u2026ZN took SL\u2019s punishment instead\u2026~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerZhao Nanyu\u2019s back was soaked with blood after 40 lashes. He had excellent endurance, and didn\u2019t even cry out because of pain from beginning to the end. But, listening to his dull hum was more painful to see.Most of the Zhao family members were watching, except for Zhao Wenyan who was still studying in the academy. The other brothers of similar age stood silently watching. No one dared to plead for Zhao Nanyu, not even Zhao Chao. He knew that his grandfather wouldn\u2019t be hard towards Zhao Nanyu. The second brother rebelled against his grandmother. Being whipped was not a severe punishment.Zhao Bo stood on the edge and watched this good play. It\u2019s strange to say that although his second brother was not very pleasant and his grandmother didn\u2019t like him, the number of times Zhao Nanyu was punished from was only a few times. It was not easy to see his second brother embarrassed once.Originally, Zhao Bo was still looking at it with great interest for fear that he would miss a little detail.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t see an interesting expression on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face. Gradually, he didn\u2019t think it was interesting.Tut, wasting time.Zhao Bo thought that if he had known that his second brother\u2019s expression was this boring when he was punished, he wouldn\u2019t come see him, and would just find other interesting things to pass time. This would be better than standing in a daze, watching him.When the whip was over, the pain from Zhao Nanyu\u2019s back was very severe. He knelt for a long time, so his knees were aching. He straightened up slowly while he gradually became paler.Having beaten him like this, old man Zhao felt soft hearted and waved his hand, \u201cHelp the third young master to go back.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was pale and his voice was light. \u201cNo, this grandson can go back on his own.\u201dOld man Zhao knew that he was stubborn. Since he said that, old man Zhao was too lazy to talk to him, and didn\u2019t continue to pester him.Song Luan had been waiting outside. When she saw Zhao Nanyu, she immediately ran to him and looked at the bloodstain on his body. She wanted to touch him, but she dared not for fear of hurting him. Her eyes were red, like she was scared to death. \u201cIs it painful? I\u2026I..I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dShe said incoherently, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll help you. I\u2019ll help you with the medicine.\u201d After a long pause, Song Luan said regretfully, \u201cI will not trouble you in the future.\u201dAfter this incident, whenever she would see the old lady, she would talk less, and won\u2019t argue again.Song Luan was very guilty. Zhao Nanyu was punished for her so badly that his face was white and bloodless, as if he would fall down any time.Zhao Nanyu put his hand on her shoulder, and leaned most of his body on her. He smiled at her, so that she wouldn\u2019t worry anymore, \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201dThe more he said this, the more uncomfortable Song Luan felt. She wiped the water from the corner of her eyes and carefully helped him walk.The servants in Huai Shui residence had already prepared hot water. Song Luan was not afraid of shame this time. Her throat was sour, but she took the initiative to say, \u201cTake off your clothes. I will clean your blood for you, and then apply the medicine.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes drooped, and his lips rose slightly. \u201cOkay.\u201dThe man\u2019s body is thin with smooth skin. There were are many whiplash marks on his back.Song Luan wiped the blood on his body with a damp cloth and asked, \u201cDoes it hurt? If it hurts, you must tell me.\u201dZhao Nanyu closed his eyes and could still smell her fragrance on the tip of his nose. He smiled softly, \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt.\u201dIn spite of what he said, Song Luan didn\u2019t dare to exert too much force. She finally dried his back and found the powder for hemostasis and scar removal in the cupboard and sprinkled a little bit on his wound.Song Luan heard him hiss and stopped quickly. She swallowed and carefully said, \u201cBear with it a little longer, it will be okay soon.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s hard for you.\u201dAfter the powder was applied, Song Luan was relieved. She took a long breath and pressed her weak finger on his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t move around tonight, or the wound will hurt.\u201dZhao Nanyu casually put on his clothes, and obediently responded well.In fact, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t feel much pain. Seeing that Song Luan was so worried about him, he deliberately acted as if he was in pain. As soon as they walked out of the room, a servant girl came to deliver a message that someone came to visit.Zhao Chao came uninvited and sat down to drink tea. There was a medicine bottle in the middle of the table. It seemed that he brought it for him.Zhao Chao wore a straight blue coat, and looked very upright. There was a three-point shallow smile on his fair face. After seeing Song Luan, he stood up and explained in a slow voice, \u201cI\u2019m here to deliver medicine to my second brother.\u201dAlthough Zhao Chao was very kind, Song Luan couldn\u2019t force to like him in her heart. Her intuition told her that this younger cousin is very deep-minded, hypocritical and scheming.After clearing her throat, she replied, \u201cThanks for your thoughtfulness, but I have already applied medicine for your second brother.\u201dUnder the moonlight, the beautiful face of Song Luan was fairer, and the bright and lustrous light sprinkled on her shoulder, which made her look serene and beautiful.Zhao Chao looked at her twice for a while before he felt disdained. He had ignored her beauty since her insides were like a decayed rotten wood, but he couldn\u2019t help but admit that her skin was indeed fascinating.Zhao Nanyu quietly pulled Song Luan behind him and touched her head, \u201cYou go inside the room first. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201dSong Luan left quickly without saying anything. Anyway, she hated Zhao Chao. It\u2019s better not to meet or talk to him.\u201cGrandfather had a good face today. Is the pain felt by second brother very bad?\u201dZhao Nanyu took the medicine bottle in Zhao Chao\u2019s hand. He put it casually, and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not serious.\u201dBut he pretended that it hurt so he could see Song Luan\u2019s concerned face.\u201cSecond brother, do you really like second sister-in-law?\u201d Zhao Chao remembered that this was not the first time he asked this question, and at that time, Zhao Nanyu never answered him.After a long time, Zhao Chao heard the soft \u201cHmm\u201d sound. If he didn\u2019t carefully listened, he wouldn\u2019t hear the small voice from Zhao Nanyu. It was easy to be ignored.Zhao Chao\u2019s smile gradually stiffened, \u201cSecond brother, what do you like about her?\u201dIn the eyes of Zhao Chao, Song Luan is worthless, vile, wicked, and shameless.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were cold and his voice was low. \u201cWhen is it your turn to take care of my affairs?\u201dListening to this low tone, Zhao Chao knew that his second brother was angry. He kept his voice, and didn\u2019t continue to prompt him for an answer.In fact, there was something more important for him to say tonight.\u201cSecond brother, the emperor is awake.\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his lips and said, \u201cNo, the emperor has never been in a coma.\u201dThe crafty emperor was testing all the people under the throne\u2013his wife, son and ministers. In the great temptation, only those who could calm down could survive.These days, the queen moved frequently and even risked recalling her father and brother to the capital secretly for the last battle.The queen took advantage of this situation to break the sixth prince\u2019s confidants.\u201cNot in coma?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Nanyu looked out the window, and at the sky, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\u201cSuch a good opportunity\u2026\u201dAs long as it\u2019s ruthless enough, the queen could be uprooted this time.Zhao Nanyu replied, \u201cNo need.\u201dZhao Chao always believed his second brother\u2019s words, so he nodded. Without asking for more information, he said. \u201cSince second brother has already made arrangements, so I will go back first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d After a pause, Zhao Nanyu called him back, thought about it, and said,\u201d I will not appear in front of her in the future.\u201dZhao Chao knew who the second elder brother meant by \u2018she\u2019.\u201cYes, second brother.\u201dWhen he left, Zhao Chao suddenly began to sympathize with the beautiful woman in the residence who didn\u2019t know anything. His second sister-in-law is stupid and poisonous. Maybe she didn\u2019t know how many days she has left to live.After knowing this second sister-in-law, Zhao Chao knew that she didn\u2019t like to be controlled. But his second brother was a man who liked to control everything in his hand.This conflict\u2013just like water and fire, between the two was incompatible.Song Luan was too weak to be his second brother\u2019s opponent.Song Luan eavesdropped between the cracks of the door, but Zhao Nanyu caught her. The moment the door was pushed open, she nearly fell to the ground. Fortunately, he held her waist in time.Zhao Nanyu looked at her with a smile, \u201cLook at what I caught? What kind of rabbit was pulled out?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face turned red. \u201cDid you know from the beginning that I was eavesdropping?\u201dWhen she couldn\u2019t wait for an answer, she quickly added, \u201cWell, I admit that I eavesdrop on purpose, just because I think he is going to speak ill of me.\u201dZhao Nanyu rubbed her face. \u201cWell, I know you hate him. I won\u2019t let him appear in front of you in the future.\u201dSong Luan was stunned. \u201cI\u2019m not mean to that extent.\u201dZhao Chao was his family. How could the family disappear just because he said it?Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t explain. As long as he wanted to, there were thousands of ways to do it. Of course, it\u2019s impossible for him to say these words in front of Song Luan. It\u2019s not good to let her know too much.Zhao Nanyu had a wound on his back, so he could only sleep on his side.Song Luan was forced to lie in his arms. In the middle of the night, Song Luan still couldn\u2019t fall asleep. She thought Zhao Nanyu had already gone to sleep, so she boldly poked him in the face. \u201cI heard\u2026you admitted that you like me.\u201dSong Luan bent her eyes and suddenly smiled happily. \u201cAlso, I am so beautiful and kind, no one will not like me.\u201dT/N: I got the ads in my site.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerIt took Zhao Nanyu half a month to get rid of his injury. This half month, he requested for leave and didn\u2019t go to Dali temple.The situation in the capital was becoming more and more serious. After the emperor woke up, the first one to be cleaned up was the queen family. Both the queen\u2019s father and brother were sent to prison, and the 10th prince, who was the queen\u2019s son, was demolished of his crown prince title.The sixth prince had been raised by the queen since he was ten years old. According to the truth, he should also be affected this time. However, during the period when the emperor was in a coma, he was so depressed that he didn\u2019t do anything other than stay in the royal palace. He didn\u2019t even fight the forces who tried to remove his own wings.Although the queen received several punishments, the sixth prince was given an exemption.After a few days, the emperor seemed to have finally made up his mind and ordered his ministers to draw up an imperial edict for the queen. After hearing about this, the sixth prince knelt outside the Wenhua hall all day and pleaded for the queen in tears.Just after noon, the old eunuch came out of the palace, and said helplessly, \u201cSixth highness, you\u2019d better go back. The emperor said that there are no more people left.\u201dThe sixth prince\u2019s voice became hoarse these past few days. Even with a hoarse throat, he yelled towards the Wenhua hall, \u201cFather, you are kind. The queen is also confused and deceived. Over the years, the queen had been sincere in treating father. Please think twice.\u201dThere was no response from the Wenhua hall.Until evening came, the sixth prince was still kneeling at the gate of the palace. Finally, a word came out from inside the hall. It was cold at that time. The old eunuch drew his hand into his narrow sleeve and said, \u201cGo back. The emperor went back to rest already.\u201dThe sixth prince, with a sad face, got up from the ground and patted the dust on his knees. \u201cThank you very much.\u201dThe sixth prince limped out of the palace. As soon as he got out, his sadness disappeared. He gave a sarcastic smile and ordered, \u201cGo back to the residence.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe queen\u2019s strength had been exhausted, but even so, the queen couldn\u2019t die yet. After all, she was his mother in name. If he wanted to become a great man, he needed a mother with high status.Although Zhao Nanyu was idle at home, he was one of the few officials promoted under these circumstances.He was directly transferred from Dali temple to be the chief censor of the inspector\u2019s court. At first, when they heard that Zhao Nanyu was transferred to the inspection court, no one in the Zhao family could believe that he\u2019s not working in Dali temple anymore. How could he suddenly get into the emperor\u2019s eye?Compared with other people, Zhao Nanyu was still indifferent to this promotion. His usual behavior was still the same even after being promoted.\u00a0No one told Song Luan about this news.After the family dinner this month, Song Luan also foolishly told Zhao Nanyu that the people in the second room seemed to be more polite to them than before.Zhao Nanyu smiled and said nothing.When it came to family dinner, Song Luan had a bitter stomach and wanted to vomit. She not only had to face the old lady\u2019s face, but also dared not stretch her chopsticks, so she didn\u2019t eat enough.As soon as she came back from the main courtyard, she began to have a stomachache, and it seemed to be tumbling. She felt nauseated after. Zhao Nanyu gave her a mouthful of warm water and said, \u201cIs it better?\u201dSong Luan frowned, but her stomach was still very uncomfortable. She shook her head, \u201cNot yet better.\u201dThese days, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s gentleness made her temper grow stronger and bigger. She pushed him away, \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink water. Just let me vomit.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t mind being pushed by her. He picked up Song Luan who was half squatting on the ground. He said to the servant girl outside the room in a cold voice, \u201cAsk the doctor to come and have a look.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBefore the doctor came, Song Luan vomited all the things she had just eaten in her stomach. Zhao Nanyu took a generous breath for her and poured her a cup of water. \u201cGargle.\u201dAfter Song Luan vomited, the feeling of nausea in her chest disappeared by half. She poured half a cup of water to clean up the taste in her mouth. After slowing down, her face became ruddy.At this time, the doctor had already arrived. Song Luan refused to let him feel the pulse. Maybe she had taken too much medicine, so she was afraid of the doctors, but even more afraid of their dark and bitter medicine.She licked her face and acted coquettish with Zhao Nanyu, \u201cI just ate and it only hurt my stomach. I\u2019m not going to make a fuss and check my pulse!\u201dZhao Nanyu held down her hand, which was frantically moving. \u201cTake a look. It won\u2019t be too bad.\u201dSong Luan was used to making trouble for no reason these two days. \u201cJust don\u2019t let the doctor look at me.\u00a0Don\u2019t bully me.\u201dHe said directly to the doctor, \u201cDoctor Du, please.\u201dShe turned her face and didn\u2019t want to see him. She was so angry that she handed her wrist to Dr. Du.After checking the pulse, Dr. Du said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad stomachache. Madam should eat less heavy food next time.\u201dShe murmured in a low voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t eat much tonight \u201cShe only had few meats on her plate, and couldn\u2019t even finish all of them.Zhao Nanyu thanked Dr. Du and sent the man out in person. Song Luan sat by the bed with her back to his body. She was still angry at his self assertion and didn\u2019t intend to talk to him.She felt complicated. On one hand, she felt that Zhao Nanyu also cared about her, but on the other hand, she felt that this man dominated her too much. He had to intervene in every detail.Zhao Nanyu knew that she did not eat too much food when they were in the main courtyard, so he ordered the kitchen to make a bowl of chicken soup noodles. The aroma was overflowing, so when Song Luan smelled the smell, her stomach grumbled. She wanted to eat the noodles.Although Song Luan was hungry, but because of her self-esteem, she restrained herself very well.Zhao Nanyu ate the noodles slowly. Song Luan was angry at the sound of his eating noodles.She would look pitiful if she cried now.Song Luan scolded Zhao Nanyu in her heart. She poked her little finger at the quilt under her body to play.Suddenly, a large shadow covered her eyes. The man sighed and pushed the bowl full of noodles to her. He laughed, \u201cWipe your mouth.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give it to me. Let me starve to death.\u201dListening to her childish words, Zhao Nanyu laughed more deeply, \u201cI can\u2019t finish it.\u201dSong Luan turned sideways, \u201cYou deliberately ate the noodles alone in front of me. Didn\u2019t you want me to vent my anger?\u201dIt\u2019s bad to make fun of her.Zhao Nanyu said what he always say to her, \u201cI\u2019m worried about you. Even if you don\u2019t like to see a doctor, if you feel uncomfortable, you still have take care of yourself. Don\u2019t inflict yourself with trouble.\u201dWhat he said was reasonable, and Song Luan couldn\u2019t refute. She was speechless.She was a little angry, but she held the bowl, and buried her head to eat the noodles. She didn\u2019t want to continue talking with him.\u201cOh? You don\u2019t want to talk to me?\u201d Zhao Nanyu pinched her ear and moved closer to whisper.Song Luan trembled, \u201cDon\u2019t lick my earlobe, I can\u2019t focus eating.\u201dWhy was he sticking closer to her? Was she that fragrant?Zhao Nanyu\u2019s lips and teeth moved downward, and he softly bit her neck, \u201cDelicious.\u201dIt\u2019s sweet and fragrant. It\u2019s really delicious.Song Luan did not have the delusion that she could correct the male lead\u2019s twisted and paranoid character.That would just be a dream.She could only pray that the male lead wouldn\u2019t become more abnormal.It\u2019s good to be a gentle young master.***Zhao Nanyu recovered from his injury and was officially admitted to the inspector general\u2019s court.Up to now, no one dared to look down on him. Even Song Heqing looked up to him.This brother-in-law was more competitive than he thought.Song Luan received an invitation letter from Song Yu at home, saying that she wanted to get together with several sisters and invited her to the poetry festival before her wedding ceremony.After two days\u2019 consideration, Song Luan finally decided to go. The poetry appreciation meeting was not only her and Song Yu, but also the invitation letter was handed to everyone, so she had no proper reason to decline it.Every year in the early winter of Daliang, there was a poetry appreciation meeting, which lasts for ten days. Scholars gather together, and this made the atmosphere lively.In the early winter, there was no snow and frost. The cold weather outside seemed to drill the bones of the body. Song Luan was afraid of the cold and wrapped herself up tightly. She wore a red cloak with a warm and soft fox hair on her head.She took a servant girl and went out of the door.Song Yu was waiting for her in the restaurant ahead of time. When Song Luan entered the elegant room, she was stunned, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there other people?\u201dIn the invitation, Song Yu said that there were other people, was it a lie?Song Yu gave her a sweet smile and poured her a cup of hot tea. \u201cSister, be at ease. Please sit down. The other sisters have not arrived yet. Maybe they\u2019re delayed with dressing up.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t like the smell very much. She went to the window and was about to open it, but Song Yu stopped her hand. \u201cSister, it\u2019s cold. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll be cold if you open the window.\u201dSong Luan twisted her eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not afraid of freezing.\u201dShe was dressed enough that the wind coming through the window didn\u2019t freeze her at all.Song Yu bowed her head in embarrassment. \u201cThis sister is wearing less clothes today. This sister is really afraid of typhoid fever.\u201dSong Luan remembered that today was not far from Song Yu\u2019s marriage day. No wonder she was afraid that she would freeze.\u00a0No one would want to be sick on the day of the marriage.Resisting the discomfort, Song Luan closed the window again.Song Yu lowered her eyes. No one saw the calculation in her eyes.Even with the doors and windows closed, Song Luan could hear the noises in the street. She had already drunk two cups of tea, but the other sisters did not arrive yet.Gradually, Song Luan also noticed something was wrong. She glanced at her servant girl and found that the servant girl had already been separated from her by Song Yu.Song Luan was about to stand up, but her legs were weak.Before she got up, she fell back on her chair.Song Luan\u2019s head was dizzy, her limbs were weak, and her white face was covered with abnormal flushed of pink.She knew that she was cheated by Song Yu.There was no one else at all. The reason why Song Yu didn\u2019t let her open the window was that there was something wrong with the aroma in the room.Song Luan opened her lips and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dKill her? Or did she want her to be insulted?Song Yu\u2019s smile at the moment was slightly ferocious.After her plan was successful, she was obviously in a good mood, and she said slowly, \u201cYou will know immediately.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Song Luan was rudely thrown into another room by Song Yu. The windows and doors were tightly closed.Song Luan was exhausted, her cheeks were getting red, and the temperature inside her body gradually rose.In her heart, Song Luan thought that Song Yu was really one of those vicious characters of this book, and her harmful means were vulgar.She barely supported her hand and sat by the bed with an unsteady breath. She smiled sarcastically at Song Yu. \u201cYou want a man to insult me, do you?\u201dWasn\u2019t it written like this? Of course, Song Luan thought that this kind of plot was for dogs.Song Yu\u2019s eyes were full of fierce light.She walked two steps forward, approaching Song Luan. Her sharp fingernails slowly scratched Song Luan\u2019s cheek. With a ferocious face and a cold smile, she spat out harsh words, \u201cHow can you call it an insult? Don\u2019t you like men the most, sister?\u201dAlthough Song Luan was not her, she still had to explain for the original owner, \u201cI only like good-looking things.\u201d\u201cMy sister has been holding it up for months, so I\u2019m going to help you today. My sister doesn\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d\u201cI thank you for your kindness. Let me go now. If anything happens to me, your brother-in-law will not let you go.\u201d Song Luan could only scare her by mentioning Zhao Nanyu.\u201cYou should worry about yourself.\u201d Song Yu knew that as soon as Zhao Nanyu finds out about Song Luan, he would see a scene where Song Luan was entangling with other men. At that time, it would be certain that Zhao Nanyu would not let Song Luan go.No man could tolerate his wife that made them wear a green hat, plus Song Luan in the past had been \u2018stirring up trouble\u2019 outside. Where would Song Luan have a good life if her husband finds out?Song Yu thought viciously that she could not marry someone she loved, so she would never let Song Luan have a good life.Song Luan\u2019s body was getting hotter and hotter, and she forced her brain to try and stay awake. She bit her teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019m your sister, I\u2019m not doing you any harm, do you really want this?\u201d\u201cSister? Ha? I\u2019ve lived under your shadow since I was a child,\u201d Song Yu said, \u201cAnd why can you do everything you want? I don\u2019t eat as much as you and also not as pretty as you. You\u2019ve been making fun of me all these years.\u201dSong Luan underestimated Song Yu\u2019s hate for her.The growing resentment spread deep into Song Yu\u2019s heart, creating the situation today. \u201cSong Yu, wait for me to get out, I will kill you.\u201d Song Luan stared at her, saying word by word.Song Yu was really shocked by what she said for a moment, but now she had no way out even if she wanted to regret it.She clapped her hands and walked outside facing an ugly and short man.\u201dServe my sister.\u201dBoth Song Luan\u2019s brain and eyes were painful. She was in chaotic.She was soberly awaken by a man in front of her.She really wanted to vomit the present cliche plot.Vulgar! Vulgar!If Song Yu wanted revenge, could she come up with an out-of-the-ordinary method?!As the man gradually approach her, Song Luan shrank back. The man grinned at her. Song Luan\u2019s eyes were hurting by looking at this ugly person. Her sister was also absolutely dead, where did she find such a disgusting person to insult her?!Song Luan gasped, carefully groping out a defensive dagger from her narrow sleeve. And when the man moved forward, she lifted her hand and used all her strength to plunge into his chest.Her clothes were covered with blood stains that had been splashed, and she couldn\u2019t bear the thought at the moment. Song Luan walked slowly to the door.She leaned her ears to the door, listening carefully to the movement outside. She was afraid that Song Yu was still outside. After listening for a while and making sure that there was no one, Song Luan pulled the door and ran.She did not run very quickly because of her weak health. She didn\u2019t know what was in the incense.Song Luan didn\u2019t know where she was. After looking at the inn, she slipped out the back door\u2026She didn\u2019t dare to walk through the main road, she could only sneak down the small path.She was exhausted after having run for a short time. She was grasping for air by the wall. Her body slid down, sitting at the corner of the alley, and wringing her palm with her fingernails. Only feeling the pain could she keep her calm.Song Luan secretly regretted it. She was too scared that after stabbing the man, she immediately left and lost the dagger. She could have used it twice by cutting her thigh so it could disperse some blood clots.Song Luan remembered one time in the original book, when the original owner was caught by Zhao Nanyu having a good time with other men.She could no longer remember the specific description, but after she was caught being raped, Zhao Nanyu only looked at her with cold eyes, and immediately closed the doors.Oh, shit. Oh, shit.She was in a fuck-shit plot.Song Luan had no doubt that if one day Zhao Nanyu saw that she betrayed him, he would cut her head off.This was the reason why she did not have a lot of men. People who are too extreme in character will do extreme things.She is more inclined to love in a long time.Song Luan\u2019s brain was getting dizzy, her vision was almost hazy, but she suddenly heard a familiar voice.\u201dAh Luan!? Why are you sitting here?!\u201dSong Luan gasped for breath. She tiredly raised her eyelids and looked up. It\u2019s Huai Jin.The handsome face was shocked and surprised. He was dressed in red, and he looked even more dazzling in this winter season.\u201dI\u2026I..I have no energy.\u201d Her legs and hands were soft.She couldn\u2019t stand up. Her body was so hot that she was about to burn up.Song Luan had sweat on her forehead. There was an abnormal pink flush on her face. Huai Jin was carrying the steamed buns he just bought, but without saying a word, he let go of the steamed buns and reached out his hand to help her who was almost collapsed on the floor.Huai Jin opened his mouth and was startled. \u201cDid you kill?! Why is there blood on your body?! And how did you get out with this look?! your husband bullying you again?\u201dSong Luan was uncomfortable, but she endure hard, \u201cNo\u2026not him, you take me back. Walk through the back door, don\u2019t let anyone else see you.\u201dShe would be criticized again if anyone sees.Song Luan meant to take her back to Zhao\u2019s house, but Huai Jin misunderstood her words. He was young and strong, so he carried her and ran to their yard.In the past, He and Song Luan often stayed in this yard. Hua Jin was a little happy because Song Luan hadn\u2019t been here for a long time and hadn\u2019t asked him to drink wine together.He put Song Luan on the bed and watched her cry in pain. He stamped his feet anxiously, \u201cShall I call a doctor for you?\u201dSong Luan sobbed at the quilt and swore that she would make Song Yu cry when she was ready!Huai Jin was young and smart. He knew that Song Luan couldn\u2019t be seen by outsiders.What\u2019s more, if he ran out to call a doctor, Song Luan would be alone and it wasn\u2019t good!Song Luan looked at the furnishings of the house and choked, \u201cI want to go back to Zhao\u2019s residence.\u201d\u201cAh? I made a mistake. Then I can take you back to Zhao\u2019s residence now?\u201d Huai Jin\u2019s voice was getting lower and lower. To be honest, he was afraid of being kicked by Zhao Nanyu again.\u201cI feel sick. Go and get me a bucket of cold water.\u201dHuai Jin found out later that she had been drugged. His words were lower as he said something in his heart, \u201cI\u2019m more effective than cold water.\u201dIt\u2019s winter now. The cold water would damage her body.Song Luan didn\u2019t have the strength to stare at him, \u201cYou. go. fetch. water. I am not afraid of cold.\u201dHuaijin saw that her expression was firm and her lower lip was bitten with blood, so he said, \u201cI will go now.\u201dHe quickly took a bucket of cold water and put it in the room. He helped Song Luan as he scolded, \u201cWho did you harm? It\u2019s too vicious! I\u2019m in pain seeing you like this. When do you plan to leave Zhao Nanyu? Although I can wait for you for a few more years, I feel a bit lonely. Otherwise, if you say you like me, I may not be angry.\u201dSong Luan replied feebly, \u201cYou talk a lot.\u201dThe original quiet courtyard suddenly heard the sound of neat and simple footsteps, and a familiar and frightful air could be felt.Song Luan decisively said to Huai Jin, \u201cQuickly, hide.\u201dHuai Jin looked dazed, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t have time to explain to him. She was so anxious that she cried, \u201cHide!\u201dAlthough Huai Jin didn\u2019t know what happened, he always obeyed and believed what she said.He opened the wardrobe unwillingly and quickly got into it.Song Luan was out of strength and fell to the ground. At this time, she was in a mess. Her collar was half open, it revealed her flushed neck. It looked alluring.At the same time, the door was vigorously kicked open.Zhao Nanyu was dressed in black. He had an expressionless face. His whole body exuded a cold breath.He held a long sword in his hand, and fresh blood beads were dripping on the blade.Song Luan could not help guessing that he had just finished killing someone.Zhao Nanyu also had a strong smell of blood.Song Luan looked at him blankly. This was the first time that she saw him holding a sword.He was murderous, gloomy and cold. There was no trace of a gentle scholar aura around him. It was like the Shura who had just finished taking everyone\u2019s life.Black boots stopped in front of her, the man squatted down, looked at her pitifully, and gently rubbed her delicate face with cold hands.Song Luan raised her finger and gently pulled his hand. Her face was flushed as she enunciated, \u201cTake me away.\u201dT/N: This is so bloody\u2026and I like it\u2026 (Spare Huai Jin, my innocent baby boy\u2026)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan probably figured out that the plot of catching her cheating in the original book happened with the original owner and Huai Jin. Zhao Nanyu was full of murderous aura now that it was not impossible to stab Huai Jin to death in rage.She and Huai Jin couldn\u2019t explain clearly in one or two sentences about why there were together in this house. Besides, Zhao Nanyu had always been biased against Huai Jin, and she dared not take risks.Zhao Nanyu held her in his arms and gently touched her head, \u201cWait.\u201dHis voice was low and hoarse, and his expression was cold. The more he was like this, the more frightened Song Luan was.Sure enough, Zhao Nanyu walked straight towards the cabinet where Huai Jin hid. Song Luan\u2019s heart suddenly felt like it lifted in the air, and her heart was tense. She pulled the corner of his clothes, with a subtle cry, \u201cI want to go back.\u201dSong Luan remembered the picture of Huai Jin\u2019s last tragic death in the snow, which made it hard for her to bear. This simple and kind boy should not meet such an end. Song Luan also knew that the fate of others in the original book could be changed.Zhao Nanyu sighed softly. He stopped his pace and said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do with you?\u201dSong Luan nested in his chest, hooked his neck with her arms, and distinctly smelled the strong smell of blood on his body. She buried her face and said pleadingly, \u201cI\u2019m dying\u2026let\u2019s go back.\u201dZhao Nanyu lightly removed the tender arms on his waist. He was very unhappy to hear such sullen words from her mouth.After a long silence, he finally gave in. He turned around and went out in a different direction. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to you once.\u201dAlthough the door of the cabinet was closed, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sword, which he had been holding in his hand, flew directly into the cabinet wood. The tip of the sword struck the middle of the wardrobe and made a sharp sound.Huai Jin shivered in the corner of the right side of the cabinet. He curled up into a ball.He was really trying hard not to jump out when he almost could have died. When he couldn\u2019t hear any sound, Huai Jin dared to breathe loudly. He pushed open the door of the cabinet and crawled out. The sword that Zhao Nanyu threw away was only a finger away from him. The cold wind crawled along his back to the back of his head.His face turned white with anger, \u201cThis dog man kicked me, and even went after my life! Watch out, I\u2019m pissed off now!\u201dHe could\u2019t eat any food tonight.Hua Jin\u2019s eyes were red. He had never seen such a fierce battle since he was a child.He was very frightened.He just thought that if he would turned into a ghost, he would haunt Zhao Nanyu forever.***Song Luan\u2019s body was very hot. She was restless as she touched her hands and feet. She was so uncomfortable to the point she groaned heavily.Zhao Nanyu held her shaking hands, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dSong Luan had been patient for a long time since the time she was with Huai Jin. She dared not take off her clothes.She was like a hungry ghost under Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arms. His body was cool and comfortable.It was already dark and the night wind of early winter stroke their faces, like a knife cutting in their faces. The cold wind kept pouring through Song Luan\u2019s collar, and she shivered. Although it was cold, the temperature on her body also dropped.Zhao Nanyu was afraid that she would catch cold. His guards handed his cloak.He covered her with his cloak. Song Luan was wrapped from the cold wind tightly, and the cold couldn\u2019t touch her.The black cloak was thick and warm, and it seemed that there was a clear fragrance of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s.Zhao Nanyu came riding a horse. He first threw Song Luan on the horse\u2019s back. Then he climbed after her, he put her hands around his waist, and immediately waved his whip. The horse screamed and ran out.Song Luan was soon taken home by Zhao Nanyu. The servants saw the young master holding a woman in his arms while hurrying into the residence, but they didn\u2019t see what the woman looked like.Zhao Nanyu kicked the door open and said in a cold voice, \u201cGo and make the antidote.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The shadow guard, who was hiding in the dark, immediately responded.The room was then warmed with charcoal.Song Luan rolled around the bed, trying to untie her clothes. Zhao Nanyu came forward to take off her coat for her, which made her feel a little better.After a while, the antidote was brought in.Zhao Nanyu was very patient and fed the medicine into her throat one spoon at a time.The antidote worked very well\u2026After a while, the heat in her body gradually subsided, and her strength gradually came back.She sat up slowly and asked, \u201cHow did you find me?\u201dHer servant was obviously separated from her by Song Yu. Song Luan was actually very desperate at that time and thought she couldn\u2019t wait for him.Zhao Nanyu said, \u201cI went out to look for you before you came back.\u201dIn fact, there were guards hiding in the dark with her that time. There was a secret passage in the room chosen by Song Yu. She took Song Luan to another room using the dark passage.The shadow guards waited outside for a long time and became suspicious. It was already late when the shadow guards rushed in, and the room was already empty.Zhao Nanyu found the room along the dark road. But when he arrived, the ugly man was not dead yet.Song Luan had no experience in stabbing people since it was her first time, so she didn\u2019t stab at the critical area.He laid on the ground and cried with pain. Seeing Zhao Nanyu, he thought he was the man who came to save him.Zhao Nanyu also laughed at him at that time, and asked him, \u201cWhere is Song Luan?\u201d\u201cWho is Song Luan?\u201dThe man didn\u2019t know her name at all, and Song Yu never told him.Zhao Nanyu laughed, \u201cIt was the woman just now.\u201dThe man swallowed his saliva and remembered Song Luan\u2019s delicate and beautiful face. He said with hatred, \u201cShe ran away after stabbing me! Brother, you save my life. My wound still hurts. I tell you, that woman is beautiful. When I catch her, I don\u2019t mind sharing her with you.\u201dBefore he finished his words, a sword light flashed in his eyes. The sword in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand cut his throat cleanly.The man gasped on the spot.There was no chance to speak those obscenities in his mouth.Song Luan thought it over and decided it was necessary to explain to him, \u201cI was cheated by my sister.\u201dZhao Nanyu touched her hair and said, \u201cI know.\u201dBefore, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t really paid attention to Song Yu. He only thought that she was a selfish fool, and that she would only use stupid ways to harm people.This time, if she said she solely planned everything, Zhao Nanyu wouldn\u2019t believe her.Song Luan looked at him with ease, and went on saying, \u201cShe tried to hurt me, and then I ran away. After that, you came over.\u201dShe tried to make light of it in a few words.She didn\u2019t want to mention Huai Jin.It\u2019s for Huai Jin\u2019s good not to mention him.Zhao Nanyu pondered for a long time, and then laughed as he praised her, \u201cWell, you did good.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s tension in her heart loosed a bit. It was good she didn\u2019t get Huai Jin involved.If she hadn\u2019t met Huai Jin, she didn\u2019t know what would happen.But Song Luan still dared not tell him Huai Jin saved her on the way. The male lead\u2019s jealousy and cleanliness were very serious, Huai Jin saw her disheveled appearance, and had that strange look on his face.She was afraid that Zhao Nanyu wouldn\u2019t believe if she tells him. He would probably even think that Huai Jin and Song Yu worked together to do this.Song Luan\u2019s request for Zhao Nanyu this evening couldn\u2019t be denied. The effect of the drug still played a role. Compared with their usual love-making, Song Luan was more conceding.It was another sleepless hour until midnight.The sound of low sobbing didn\u2019t stop until the middle of the night.***Song Luan heard news about Song Yu three days later.When Song Yu was praying for blessings in the Buddhist temple, she was kidnapped in private.Killing or spilling blood in a temple was not allowed, so she was dragged down the mountain and was beaten until she was almost half-dead. The Song family spent a lot of energy to save Song Yu\u2019s life, but now, she couldn\u2019t get married.After the marriage was cancelled, Song Yu was sent to nunnery, and she had to commit to living a secular life.Song Luan knew that there was still a little bit anger in her own heart, so she was very relieved when she heard what happened to her. Song Yu deserved this fate.These days, Song Luan found that it became more difficult for her to go out. Grandma Lin was watching her tightly. She had wanted to slip out, but all her plans came to nothing.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s people followed her. As soon as she stepped out of the gate, several people suddenly appeared in all directions.Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She was angry with them, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me! I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dNot only that, she also found that most people around them seemed to pay more and more respect to Zhao Nanyu. At this time, Song Luan knew that he had been promoted to imperial censor of the capital.Song Luan\u2019s heart sank. If she remembered correctly, soon after Zhao Nanyu became the imperial censor of the capital, the Song family collapsed and the new emperor ascended the throne after the emperor died.When these things happen, many unfortunate events happened.But in the original book, it should had been several months before Zhao Nanyu became the imperial censor of the capital. To her surprise, the timeline in the book had also changed.After the new emperor ascended the throne, the male lead became powerful and gradually grew into a human that resembled a shura.However, Song Luan did not care about these at present. She had to solve the problem of her personal freedom.At night, she stood in front of Zhao Nanyu, and coughed twice to get his attention. She needs to discussed it with him, \u201cCan you withdraw your bodyguards? I don\u2019t like too many people going out with me.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dZhao Nanyu had given orders that the bodyguards should stop her to areas where she was not allowed.Song Luan was silent.Zhao Nanyu pinched her chin and pulled out a cold smile. \u201cDo you want to go to Huai Jin?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s jealousy was heavier than anyone else in the world. His love was million times heavier than others.After a moment\u2019s pause, he lied to her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look for him. I\u2019ve already killed him.\u201dT/N: If you\u2019ve read WCE until to this chapter, and still enjoyed it, please leave a review/rating on NU~ thank you!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.T/N: Just a heads up, this chapter is quite long! Was thinking of splitting this chapter, but decided not to. Lmao. Happy reading~Translated by: TinkerSong Luan\u2019s face was pale and her lips were trembling. It seemed as if there was a basin of cold water pouring directly from her head. Her heart felt like it was constantly falling. Her knee was shaking uncontrollably, \u201cYou say\u2026what?\u201dZhao Nanyu used a little strength to pinch her chin. He glanced at her lightly. His eyes were cold. \u201cI killed him. Are you distressed?\u201dZhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t tolerate Song Luan\u2019s concern for other men.He remembered that she liked that boy named Huai Jin very much. She redeemed the man from slavery, bought him a yard, and raised him for several years. In the past, he felt nothing, but now he couldn\u2019t tolerate it at all.As long as he thought of Song Luan\u2019s smile, and her closeness to that man, his heart was like being bitten by ants. He would feel pain for long periods of time.Song Luan\u2019s ears were buzzing. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s words were like a heavy blow. It hit her head straight. She couldn\u2019t breathe. Her throat was hoarse and her eyes were red. \u201cYou killed him?!\u201dShe raised her face, and her red eyes wide open as it stared at his face.She couldn\u2019t calm down and asked him in a low voice, \u201cWhat are you doing by killing him?! How can you?!\u201dSong Luan\u2019s words were not clear. She was trembling while trying to open her mouth, \u201cDo you know\u2026do you know that it was him who saved me? Is your heart so cruel? Why?\u201dShe was about to cry.After transmigrating, Song Luan actually regarded herself as an outsider. She regarded everyone as characters in the book\u2013just virtual people, but gradually, these people left a mark on her heart.Zhao Nanyu gently wiped the water from the corners of her eyes with his thumb, \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered me. Do you love him?\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t stop sneering, \u201cYes.\u201dAnd she gave him a provocative look. \u201cYes, I love him. What do you want to do then? Do you want to kill me too? You\u2026\u201dHaven\u2019t you already thought of killing me since before?Zhao Nanyu then asked, \u201cSince he saved you, why did you lie to me?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s fear of Zhao Nanyu was natural.She always had nightmares these days.In her dream, the sky seems to be stained with bright red blood. Zhao Nanyu stood on the high wall, coldly watching the corpses below him. He held a sharp sword in his hand, and his white clothes were stained with blood. His flawless face was also splashed with blood.He had no expression, no waves in his eyes, and his dark pupils were like a pool of stagnant water, gazing at the world in a gloomy and silent way.He was the male lead of this world. He had the biggest golden finger given by God.He was cruel.He was violent.He always had the upper hand, and no one could stand against him.Song Luan in the dream looked at him quietly, and a familiar feel came from the inside of her body. That kind of feeling was like being spilled with sulfuric acid. It was corroding her body gradually. She could even hear the sound of her kidney being eroded.Song Luan felt pain every time she dreamed of it.She stood not far away from Zhao Nanyu. She stretched out her hand and wanted to ask him for help. But when she looked carefully, she found that the sword in the man\u2019s hand had already penetrated her heart.\u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d Song Luan said with a pale and weak expression.Song Luan shook her eyes. She staggered, and just barely used the table for support until she could stand still.She even pulled off her wrist. Her whole body was cold.Zhao Nanyu touched her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. I just lied to you.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s back was sweating as he said those few words.Huai Jin didn\u2019t die.Her legs became softer, and she fell helplessly into his arms. Song Luan looked at the man holding her with complicated eyes.When she closed her eyes, Song Luan could still remember Zhao Nanyu blocking the whip for her that day.Sometimes, when she felt that she was about to fall in love with him, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s actions would always dissuade her.The net that he had casted in the sky made her breathless.***Song Luan was angry.She was timid, but she also had a temper.She found that she and Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t always quarrel. He seldom loses control. Every word he said and every expression he did was just right.Even if Song Luan was angry with him, she couldn\u2019t hurt his vital point. It was like punching a cotton.Song Luan felt that instead of making a scene with him, she might as well behave as if she didn\u2019t care about anything.And these days coincided with the change of the current situation in the court.Zhao Nanyu was busy every day. There was once that he didn\u2019t come back for three consecutive days.As for this, Song Luan didn\u2019t even ask.Every day, she only read books and played with her gold and silver jewelry.Occasionally, she would cook a meal for little Zhao. She was very comfortable.Zhao Nanyu stayed in the palace all this time. His cold facial features fell deep into the darkness. His expression was hard to distinguish.He asked the people behind him in a cold voice, \u201cDid she ask anything about me?\u201dHis subordinates lowered their heads and didn\u2019t dare to look at him. They said, \u201cShe never asked.\u201dZhao Nanyu tightened his jaw, his outline was cold and hard, \u201cDidn\u2019t she ask even a single word?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201dThe cold wind burst and the first snow fell down slowly.The aura around Zhao\u00a0Nanyu\u00a0suddenly\u00a0felt\u00a0a\u00a0little\u00a0cold.\u00a0It\u00a0seemed\u00a0that\u00a0Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0good\u00a0life\u00a0at\u00a0home\u00a0alone,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0never\u00a0mattered\u00a0whether\u00a0he\u00a0was\u00a0away or not.The\u00a0subordinates raised\u00a0their\u00a0eyes\u00a0and\u00a0opened\u00a0their\u00a0mouths.The\u00a0man\u00a0suddenly\u00a0cooled\u00a0down. He gritted his teeth as he said,\u00a0\u201cRoll.\u201dHe was\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0bad\u00a0mood,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0subordnates\u00a0were\u00a0afraid\u00a0to\u00a0say\u00a0more. They\u00a0left\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0speed.Zhao Nanyu still stayed in the palace even after several days later. He hadn\u2019t returned, nor did he let anyone deliver a message to Song Luan.Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0show\u00a0any\u00a0dissatisfaction,\u00a0but\u00a0third lady Zhao\u00a0had\u00a0something\u00a0to\u00a0say.Third lady Zhao\u00a0truly\u00a0felt\u00a0that\u00a0Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0had\u00a0repented,\u00a0and\u00a0she\u00a0hoped\u00a0that\u00a0these\u00a0two people would\u00a0live\u00a0a\u00a0good\u00a0life.\u00a0They shouldn\u2019t\u00a0quarrel. This\u00a0cold\u00a0war\u00a0would\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0hurt\u00a0her\u00a0feelings,\u00a0but\u00a0this would not help them in the future.Between husband and wife, there can never be two people who are brave, one must always be soft.Her husband, Zhao Sanye, was a jerk three years ago. But now, he changed since they were harmonizing together. She coaxed him. Men and women need to pay attention with unifying their yin and yang\u2013both soft and hard.Third lady Zhao didn\u2019t favor\u00a0Zhao\u00a0Nanyu.\u00a0He\u00a0was\u00a0her stepson, so\u00a0matter\u00a0how\u00a0good\u00a0he\u00a0was,\u00a0they wouldn\u2019t get close.And Song Luan was a person who could easily be heard from gossips and rumors. Everyone said that she didn\u2019t have any heart at all. This time, even if the people knew about their cold war, they didn\u2019t care much about them at all.***When\u00a0Zhao\u00a0Nanyu\u00a0was\u00a0away\u00a0from\u00a0home,\u00a0little Zhao lived in the same room as Song Luan. And\u00a0like\u00a0his\u00a0father,\u00a0his\u00a0hands\u00a0and\u00a0feet\u00a0were\u00a0cold.\u00a0In this winter,\u00a0Song Luan had to cover him.Every\u00a0day,\u00a0Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0wrapped\u00a0him\u00a0like\u00a0a\u00a0dumpling. She was afraid that he would start sneezing.She\u00a0also\u00a0learned\u00a0how to\u00a0sew\u00a0a cloak, so she\u00a0bought\u00a0a\u00a0white\u00a0fox\u00a0fur\u00a0to\u00a0make it.Song\u00a0Luan\u2019s agenda\u00a0these\u00a0days\u00a0was to make little Zhao even beautiful.It\u00a0snowed\u00a0for\u00a0several\u00a0days\u00a0in\u00a0the capital. The floor was covered with white snow, and a thick\u00a0layer\u00a0of\u00a0sunlight\u00a0shone towards it. The snow soon turned\u00a0into\u00a0a\u00a0glittering\u00a0water\u00a0beads\u00a0as it dripped down.Little Zhao had less homework these days. He only need to practice two words a day, and he was often found in the residence of Song Luan.The\u00a0child\u2019s\u00a0words\u00a0were still as few\u00a0as\u00a0ever. His answers were always concise and clear.\u00a0But whenever Song Luan pampered him, he would have that embarrassed look in his face.After being together for so long, Song Luan discovered that little Zhao only looked cold, he was in fact, very clingy. Whatever Song Luan was doing, he would watch and stare at her.Today, Song Luan made a big snowman with little Zhao in the snow. Although both of their hands were freezing, they were happy.Little Zhao\u2019s fingers were red, so she brought him back to the residence. She warmed a soup for him, and covered him with clothes. She cleaned his hands as she asked him while smiling, \u201cIsn\u2019t it cold?\u201dHe shook\u00a0his\u00a0head. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0not\u00a0cold.\u201dHe\u00a0then handed\u00a0her\u00a0the soup to share, and\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cHere, mother.\u201d\u201cYou are so filial!\u201dHe\u00a0blushed\u00a0and\u00a0lowered\u00a0his\u00a0head.Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0held his hands in front of the fire for a while. After he was warmed up, she\u00a0dared\u00a0to ask him,\u00a0\u201cI think you\u2019ve\u00a0been\u00a0depressed\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a0two\u00a0days.\u201dSong\u00a0Luan\u00a0thought\u00a0that little Zhao had been depressed\u00a0because\u00a0of\u00a0his\u00a0heavy\u00a0school\u00a0work,\u00a0but\u00a0then\u00a0realized that\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0was\u00a0Zhao Nanyu not at home,\u00a0but\u00a0Zhao Chao also rarely\u00a0came to teach little Zhao.Zhao\u00a0Chao\u00a0was\u00a0not young, so his\u00a0mother\u00a0was\u00a0desperate trying to to\u00a0get\u00a0him to\u00a0find a marriage candidate.Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0heard\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0matchmaker\u00a0introduced\u00a0Zhao\u00a0Chao\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0well-matched and intelligent girl. If\u00a0it was successful,\u00a0it\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0not\u00a0long\u00a0before\u00a0they\u00a0could\u00a0drink\u00a0Zhao\u00a0Chao\u2019s\u00a0wedding\u00a0wine.In\u00a0the\u00a0book,\u00a0Zhao Chao\u00a0was\u00a0deeply\u00a0rooted\u00a0towards the female lead. But now\u00a0that the female lead didn\u2019t appear in the capital, she was not sure if he would fall in love with other girls. Zhao Chao\u00a0was,\u00a0after\u00a0all,\u00a0a\u00a0figure who was determined.Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0also\u00a0heard\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0girls\u00a0who met with Zhao Chao for several days had failed. His\u00a0mother\u00a0hadn\u2019t\u00a0let\u00a0him\u00a0go\u00a0these\u00a0days,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0looked\u00a0like\u00a0he was\u00a0going\u00a0to\u00a0have\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0married\u00a0this\u00a0year.As a result,\u00a0Zhao Chao\u00a0didn\u2019t have\u00a0much\u00a0time\u00a0to\u00a0teach\u00a0little Zhao.Little Zhao,\u00a0with\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0down,\u00a0said with\u00a0low\u00a0and muffled voice,\u00a0\u201cMother, I\u00a0think\u00a0of\u00a0my\u00a0father.\u201dLittle Zhao, who was clingy, hadn\u2019t seen his father for ten days. He was not used to it.Song Luan\u2019s fingertips stiffened, and she smiled, \u201cYour father is busy in the palace. You\u2019ll see him in a few days.\u201dHowever, she didn\u2019t ask about his whereabouts, nor did Zhao Nanyu send someone to her. Song Luan wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to send him a message. The one who would surrender first was definitely not her.Her love that accumulated for a few days towards Zhao Nanyu had easily vanished.Little Zhao hugged her waist, burying his face. His voice sounded aggrieved, \u201cI\u2026I\u2026I\u2026\u201dHe was\u00a0confused.Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0touched\u00a0his\u00a0head,\u00a0and whispered,\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0know\u00a0you\u00a0miss\u00a0him. Wait\u00a0for him to come back, okay?\u201dLittle Zhao closed his lips. He looked up, then asked her, \u201cCan you take me to palace to see father?\u201dVisit the palace? It was not impossible.But Song Luan also knew that Zhao Nanyu was probably busy fighting for power during this time. It was not easy to be an imperial censor.At this time where the emperor can change, if there were any carelessness, it would result to a disaster.Before that, the sixth prince knelt in the Wenhua hall for many days, which moved the emperor. The old emperor first issued an edict praising his filial piety, and then released the queen from the cold palace.Zhao Nanyu was busy cleaning up the remnants of the queen in the Qing palace. Anyone could see that the emperor wouldn\u2019t live long, but the imperial edict of establishing the crown prince hadn\u2019t been issued yet.Song Luan sighed. She didn\u2019t want to see Zhao Nanyu, so she said, \u201cSilly child, how can the palace be so easy to enter? We\u2019ll just wait at home.\u201dHe was depressed and lost.Song Luan\u2019s heart softened. She looked down at him and said, \u201cYou can write so many words now, so you can write a letter to your father. \u201cLittle Zhao didn\u2019t say anything, Song Luan knew that he was sad in his heart, but she still insisted that they shouldn\u2019t go to the palace.It was in the afternoon that little Zhao was lying on the bed beside her. She took off his coat and covered him with a quilt and held him.Little Zhao said, \u201cMother, I\u2019ll write to my father in the evening.\u201dSong Luan was secretly relieved. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t continue to say that he wanted to enter the palace.She closed her eyes and thought in silence that maybe after this winter, the capital would change.Zhao Nanyu was about to embark on his path as a powerful minister. There were less than three months left before the original owner was poisoned to death in the book.Song Luan didn\u2019t feel discomfort in her body recently. She just felt pain whenever she dreamed. The pain was like having all the organs eroded.It really didn\u2019t feel like a dream.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s poison to the original owner was very tricky, and the poison was also chronic. It devoured the body\u2019s life year by year.It was written in the book that the original owner would live in pain every day, and all the organs in her body seems to be stirred by a knife. The pain made her speechless, but he couldn\u2019t die for a long while even if she wanted to.This kind of poison would torture her to death.Song Luan was in-between awake and asleep, she would\u2026not be suffering from this kind of torture, Zhao Nanyu had been merciful to her.When Zhao Nanyu gets the power, she could escape.The mother and the son slept until the early evening.The room was warm. Incense sticks were lit in the censer, and the light fragrance drifted from it.Song Luan put on her embroidered shoes and dress. She called the maidservant in. Although she lowered her hands and feet, the little noise still woke up her son who was sleeping on the bed.He rubbed his eyes. He looked cute and adorable.He called out to her mother, and then stretched out his hand, \u201cHug.\u201dSong Luan whimpered three times in her heart because of her son\u2019s lovely appearance. She put on clothes for him and carried him up.The servant girls swarmed in and began to prepare their meals.Song Luan held him in her arms. She went to the desk, placed the little kid on the chair, and said, \u201cWrite to your father. I\u2019m afraid he couldn\u2019t wait to receive your letter.\u201dLittle Zhao nodded obediently. He took the pen in a proper posture.Naturally, Song Luan would not read what he had written. When little Zhao was writing a letter, she went outside the yard to fold some plum flowers and put them into a vase, which made it very beautiful. The fragrance of the plum blossom was pleasant.Little Zhao wrote the letter quickly, put it in the envelope, and handed it to her, \u201cMom, I\u2019ve finished it.\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOnce upon a time, when Zhao Nanyu went out, his brother-in-law would write to him, but his words were not too many and he would not say sweet words. When will he come back?Whenever Zhao Nanyu traveled outside, little Zhao would always write him a letter. The words were not too many. He would not say sweet words.\u00a0The content in the letter was always the question \u2018when would father come back?\u2019Song Luan put his letter away with a smile, and planned to wait until tomorrow to let the servant deliver to the palace.There was another heavy snow on new year\u2019s day.News came out the palace that the emperor fell ill again, and several young princes visited the palace.Song Luan almost thought Zhao Nanyu was going to spend the Spring Festival in the palace. She guessed that he did not want to see her.But on the afternoon of the lunar new year, Zhao Nanyu rode back from the palace to Zhao\u2019s residence. The gatekeepers were surprised.Zhao Nanyu, with a cold face, had just crossed the gate. The people around him respectfully came up to him and said, \u201cYoung master, please come inside.\u201dHe had not been home for many days, so he should go to see his grandparents first.Zhao Nanyu had a trace of impatience. He clenched his fingers and put away his murderous breath. He spit out two words coldly, \u201cI know.\u201dThe situation in capital was tense, and old man Zhao had something to tell him so he called him over.Most of the men in the Zhao\u2019s family was in the room. The elder brother who was not in the capital had also returned.The old man said to them earnestly, \u201cYou must be careful with your words and deeds these days. Remember not to stand in line at will. It is always the right way to protect yourself. Don\u2019t let any of you fall into this murky water, or this will affect the whole family.\u201dSince ancient times, the dispute of seizing the emperor position had been bloody. It would involve countless deaths and injuries.All the descendants nodded and said yes.The old man cast a special glance at the absent-minded Zhao Nanyu and said, \u201cAh Yu, do you hear me?\u201dZhao Nanyu lowered his eyes and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dFrom the courtyard of old man Zhao, Zhao Nanyu went straight to Song Luan\u2019s residence. Through a door, Zhao Nanyu could hear her laughter.The house was full of lights. He didn\u2019t know what she had said to little Zhao. but she fell on the bed laughing.Zhao Nanyu pushed the door open with both hands, and the cold wind came in with the snow.He stood by the door, his figure was tall and imposing. He had cold features. His dark eyes was unfathomable as the deep pool.Zhao Nanyu stared at Song Luan who fell on the bed laughing. The burning charcoal made the room warm. She only wore a light pink dress. Her collar was slightly open, her collarbone was half exposed, and her mouth was slightly open. It seems that she was a little surprised.Zhao Nanyu had to say that Song Luan\u2019s ignorant and beautiful appearance really made him want to ravage her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerWhen Song Luan saw Zhao Nanyu, she put away the smile on her face, then arranged her clothes, and greeted him with her face lowered.Little Zhao wasn\u2019t wearing any shoes when he stepped on the carpet with his socks on. He ran to Zhao Nanyu in a hurry. He hugged his thigh tightly and looked up at him. The charcoal fire in the room made his face a little red. He smiled with twinkling eyes, \u201cFather.\u201dZhao Nanyu touched his face, picked him up, and looked up at Song Luan, who was silent. He walked over and asked in a low voice, \u201cHave you had dinner?\u201dShe shook her head, \u201cNot yet.\u201dSong Luan suddenly stood up and put on a coat. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask someone to set up the meal.\u201dShe hadn\u2019t seem him for ten days. Song Luan felt that Zhao Nanyu seemed to have lost weight. However, this was not surprising. This period of time was a critical moment, obviously he would be busy. She only pitied little Zhao\u2019s newly written letter.Because it\u2019s new year\u2019s day, the evening meal was especially rich. The red candle illuminated the room brightly.Song Luan also went to the kitchen in the afternoon to stew pigeon soup, cooked a bowl of wine and dumplings.It was warm in the room. Zhao Nanyu took off his outer cloak, and only wore a blue inner cloth.After drinking half a bowl of pigeon soup, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t eat much more. He seemed to have something on his mind.Since the beginning, he had a frown on his face, and looked a little gloomy.Song Luan pretended that she didn\u2019t see anything. She just ate her own food, and didn\u2019t even talk to Zhao Nanyu. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t speak on purpose, she just had nothing to say.The happiest one here was little Zhao. In the past, it was only him and his father, but this year was different because his mom was also here.After dinner, Song Luan hid in the inner room, and looked for a needle and thread from the drawer. She planned to embroider a pair of socks for her son. Her needlework was messy, but this was only for practice.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face became more ugly, but still did not say anything. He just went to little Zhao\u2019s desk, and began to check his homework. These days, although Zhao Chao came less, little Zhao didn\u2019t dare to relax even a little bit.It was already late when he finished checking his homework.Song Luan washed her face with water. After that, she slowly moved to Zhao Nanyu. Her face was light and calm. \u201cWhere are you going to sleep tonight?\u201dShe thought Zhao Nanyu would not like to stay in her room. He was probably still angry since he didn\u2019t send anyone to bring a message for so many days.Zhao Nanyu opened his lips and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep here.\u201dHe\u2019s staying. Song Luan subconsciously pinched her palm, and her face was a little white. She nodded and said it was good.Grandma Lin took little Zhao down to wash. She and Zhao Nanyu were the only ones left in the room. She began to feel nervous. Even if she lowered her face, she could feel his eyes staring at her.Song Luan raised her head.She opened her mouth, and was about to say something, when the man in front of her strode forward, picked up her waist with one hand, and threw her directly on the bed.As soon as she was about to get up, a black shadow hovered on top of her.Zhao Nanyu had been patient for a long time, but he couldn\u2019t restrain himself any longer. The trapped beast within him was completely released from its cage. He was treated coldly for more than ten days, and was furious.His face was as cold as ice. His big palm strongly clasped her wrist on the bed, gently folded it and pressed it on her head. Zhao Nanyu lowered his head and kissed her. Song Luan didn\u2019t look at his face and narrowly avoided his kiss.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s dark eyes flashed with anger. His one hand clasped her delicate white jade wrist, and the other free hand firmly pressed her chin, forcing her eyes to face him.He asked in a low voice, \u201cHate me?\u201dSong Luan admitted and did not deny it.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to want to talk to her. He bit her lip into a small hole, tasted the sweet and bloody flavor, and was satisfied.Zhao Nanyu was untying her dress belt when Song Luan took advantage of this to break free to push him away. She held the quilt in front of her chest, and looked guarded.Zhao Nanyu sneered twice. He was stabbed by her unwillingness, and it made him pale. He raised his hands to extinguished all the candles in the room, and they were suddenly plunged into darkness.Song Luan turned back her back to him\u2026her mind was confused, she just didn\u2019t want to let Zhao Nanyu touch her tonight.After she had gone to sleep, Zhao Nanyu was still awake. The moonlight was bright, and the light of the night happened to shine on her cheek. All of a sudden, he saw her eyes began to silently shed tears.The woman seemed to have a nightmare. She looked uneasy, so Zhao Nanyu reached out his arms to wipe her tears with his fingers.He sighed, \u201cWhat should I do with you?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t scold her.It\u2019s like raising a little ancestor.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart was covered with pain, but this little ancestor didn\u2019t have him in her heart.***The next day, Song Luan woke up early. She didn\u2019t sleep well that night. She had been dreaming intermittently.In the dream, all the organs in her body got corroded, and it was very painful. But after she woke up, she didn\u2019t feel any discomfort.Song Luan hated her dreams. Most of the time, the pictures she dreamed about were the ones that happened in the past. She started to feel uneasy.In the end of her dream, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t poison her, but stabbed her to death with a sword instead?Song Luan was too lazy to think about it again, less she frightened herself. All of a sudden, she heard Zhao Nanyu getting up from the bed, so she quickly closed her eyes and continued to pretend to sleep.The man beside her opened the quilt and got out of bed. After putting on his clothes, he looked at her side.Zhao Nanyu stared at her silently for a long time. Suddenly, he raised his finger to her collar and lifted it as if to look at something. The jade pendant he gave her was still on her neck.He took back his fingers, and soon Song Luan heard the sound of closing the door.As soon as Zhao Nanyu left, she immediately opened her eyes and sat up on the bed. She almost forgot the jade pendant he had given her. At first, she was reluctant to wear it, but later, she was coaxed by Zhao Nanyu to wear it. Then, she was used to wearing it these days.Song Luan put on an outer garment, went to the window, and opened a small crack. The sky outside was still snowing. The red plum blossoms in the yard were full of frost and snow, and the branches were covered with a layer of white snow.It was a beautiful scenery of red and white colors blending together.The cool wind came in through the crack of the window. After a short while, Song Luan felt cold, so she closed the window tightly.She untied the red rope on her neck, carefully put the jade pendant in the palm of her hand, and looked at it carefully for a moment. She quietly put it in the locked drawer in front of the dresser.When she opened the drawer, there was letter and a book inside. This letter was not written by Song Luan, she had it on her body when she transmigrated. She thought it was written by the original owner, and and never gave it to Zhao Nanyu for various reasons.Song Luan placed the book and the letter together. She felt that it won\u2019t be long for these two things to be delivered to Zhao Nanyu.She didn\u2019t know if there was too much cold wind, but that night, Song Luan began to cough. Zhao Nanyu looked at her several times.Song Luan\u2019s throat itched, and she managed not to cough. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dZhao Nanyu continued to write, but Song Luan\u2019s cough could not be suppressed.The man put down his pen and turned out of the door.Song Luan thought that he was annoyed by the noise and went to the study room by himself, and she felt a bit upset. After a while, the door was opened, and Zhao Nanyu came in with a bowl of sweetened chilled pear soup.Zhao Nanyu handed her the bowl and said, \u201cDrink it.\u201dAfter a pause, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s cold these days, so take care of yourself. If you want to see the plum blossom, let the maidservant help you take two branches and put them in the room.\u201dIt turned out he knew what she did every day.Now was not the time to feign affection, Song Luan took the soup he handed and drank it slowly. Her voice was more comfortable than before, and she whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201dSong Luan had a vague feeling that he would need to continue to endure the whole evening.Taking into account that Zhao Nanyu had been abstinent for many days, plus he was also a vigorous young man, Song Luan knew she couldn\u2019t escape this time.He was hurt by Song Luan\u2019s action last night, so he let her go just once.Tonight, Zhao Nanyu blindfolded her eyes. He didn\u2019t want to see her indifferent eyes full of alienation.In the end, Song Luan didn\u2019t have the energy to lift her hands. She had weak fingers and had no strength.Zhao Nanyu hugged her with sweat.After a while of vigorous love making, Zhao Nanyu was kind enough to untie the black tie that blindfolded her eyes. He wrapped a finger around her black hair and played with it.Song Luan soon slept. In her memory, Zhao Nanyu seemed to have said a word to her, but because she slept like the dead, she didn\u2019t hear it clearly.***After this love affair, Zhao Nanyu went out early, and returned late every day. Sometimes he was too busy that he just slept directly in his study. He didn\u2019t come to her side for several days.Song Luan thought that Zhao Nanyu was deliberately snubbing her, but she really didn\u2019t care. She liked it when Zhao Nanyu ignores her. As a result, although both were at home, they met less often than before.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s birthday was on the fourth day. Song Luan had forgotten all about it, and knew it only when grandma Lin mentioned it in her ear.At this time, there was no time to prepare his birthday gift. Song Luan pretended that she didn\u2019t know, and had nothing prepared from the beginning to the end.Song Luan still remembered that the male lead didn\u2019t like celebrating his birthday. He felt it was troublesome, and considered it to be an ordinary day. There was no difference between the average days.In the daytime, Zhao Nanyu did not appear in front of her. Song Luan thought in her heart that maybe he had forgotten his birthday.At night, she had just climbed into bed and covered herself with quilt, when the door of the room was pushed open. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s chest was stuffy, and he looked very uncomfortable.He approached her with a cold face, sat down by the bed, and looked at her directly, but said nothing.Song Luan\u2019s fingers quietly grasped the bed sheet under her body. Her knuckles were pale. She thought Zhao Nanyu was looking for her to settle accounts.Song Luan waited for a long time, but he didn\u2019t open his mouth, so she asked instead, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was pale. He smiled and said, \u201cNothing. Just came to see you.\u201dHe should not have expected her to remember his own birthday. Zhao Nanyu thought, in his heart, maybe he was not as important as that boy named Huai Jin.Seeing that she was uncomfortable, Zhao Nanyu immediately stood up, \u201cI have something to do, go sleep.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLooking at his thin back, Song Luan suddenly felt a little uncomfortable, and somehow began to feel guilty, as if she had really done something very excessive.She put out the light, and laid upright on the bed for a long time, unable to fall asleep. Trying to close her eyes, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s pale face was reflected in her pupils. He looked very lonely and pitiful. It was strange that her heart easily turned soft, and even pitied him.The character of the male lead was very typical which made everyone love and hate. He had a miserable childhood, was not valued by his relatives, and was often bullied and humiliated by others. But at the same time, he was also a ruthless, and could kill people without blinking an eye.Probably no one would live for him in his life.Zhao Nanyu probably wanted to talk, but eventually stopped. Maybe he wanted to tell her about it?Song Luan was so confused that she rolled on the bed for two times. With a deep sigh, she got up, dressed again, and went to the kitchen.Song Luan cooked a bowl of noodles with shredded chicken for Zhao Nanyu. She put it in the food box, and prepared to send it to his study.It was too cold outside. In the middle of the journey, Song Luan went back to find her own cloak and covered herself with it. Most of her face was hidden in the fur collar, revealing a pair of round eyes.When she came to the study, her shoes and socks were soaked with snow, which made her feel uncomfortable.Song Luan raised her hand and knocked on the door. There was no movement inside. She knocked twice again, and Zhao Nanyu\u2019s voice fell through the door and into her ears. The voice wasn\u2019t pleasant.\u201cWho?\u201dSong Luan moistened her throat and said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dThere was silence for a long time, and before long, the door in front of her was opened from the inside.Zhao Nanyu dragged her into the room.He was so quick and powerful that the food box in Song Luan\u2019s hand was almost knocked over.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were dark, and he asked, \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201dNot long ago, Song Luan seemed to have asked him similar question before.She took out the shredded chicken noodles from the food box. The soup was still hot. It was still steaming. She didn\u2019t say it was longevity noodles, and gently spoke, \u201cOh, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re hungry, so I cooked a bowl of noodles for you.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s breath in his chest seemed to vanish. His hoarse voice followed her words, \u201cYes, I\u2019m really hungry.\u201dFor the first time in many years, someone remembered his birthday and cooked him noodles.Old man Zhao didn\u2019t remember it, nor did the old lady.In this family, no one cared about his life and death.Although Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t like noodles, he ate the bowl of noodles made by Song Luan.He ate everything to the point that there was no soup left.Song Luan seldom comes into his study. Maybe she didn\u2019t smell the sandalwood in his study, but her chest suddenly felt stuffy, and she felt like vomiting.Her face turned pale. Song Luan wanted to leave the room as soon as possible. \u201cI\u2019m sleepy, too. I\u2019ll go back to my room to have a rest.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s observation skill was amazing. He pinched her wrist and stopped her. \u201cWhy do you look paler?\u201dSong Luan was tormented by this disgusting feeling of wanting to vomit. Her eyes were redder than a rabbit. There were some tears hanging from the corners of her eyes.She angrily waved his hand. \u201cThe smell in the study is too bad. I\u2019m going back!\u201dZhao Nanyu let go of her hand, and looked at her with some thoughts. He tied the belt of her cloak, and ordered his servants to send her back.After they left, Zhao Nanyu told his entourage outside the door, \u201cPlease bring grandma Lin here.\u201dHe remembered that this was the second time that Song Luan felt like vomiting for no reason.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Zhao Nanyu stood by the window in the quiet cold wind for a moment.Before long, grandma Lin arrived. His back was turned to her, and his voice was cold. \u201cHas my wife\u2019s monthly period come?\u201dGrandma Lin lowered her eyes and did not dare lift her head. There was no candle in the room, so the area was dark. She could only see the figure of the young master.She replied, \u201cNot yet.\u201dWhen the young master asked this question in the middle of the night, he must have been suspicious, so after a moment\u2019s hesitation, grandma Lin added, \u201cBut madam\u2019s monthly period is not so accurate.\u201dZhao Nanyu also knew about it, and that Song Luan didn\u2019t care much about her body.Zhao Nanyu nodded and said in a deep voice, \u201cYou should serve her carefully these days.\u201dGrandma Lin already had a worry in her heart. Was young master suspicious that madam might be pregnant? Yes, they had a good relationship a few days ago, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that madam would get pregnant.She thought silently, this was also a good thing. She was only hoping that this time Madam would not treat her child the same as she treated little Zhao before.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, young master.\u201d***Song Luan herself was not aware of this. She occasionally felt some nausea, but was so used to it that she didn\u2019t take it seriously.After several days of continuous snow in the capital, it finally stopped.The sun was now shining. There was a thick layer of snow in the yard.Song Heqing gave her a message that he wanted to see Song Luan, so she dressed in thick clothes, and walked out the residence in fear. She thought that maybe there was something wrong with the Song family.After waiting in restaurant, her heart slightly skipped a beat. Song Heqing\u2019s face was a little thinner, and the outline of his face was a little sharp. His brows were frowning, and looked very worried. He looked at his arrogant sister and stopped a few times.He coughed twice and said apologetically, \u201cAh Luan, what the fourth sister did\u2026\u201dSong Luan guessed that her brother, who was eager to protect his sisters, already knew what Song Yu had done. She took a sip of tea and said, \u201cBrother, it has nothing to do with you.\u201dSong Heqing grimaced, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that she was so hostile to you! Doing dirty tricks that could harm your life..\u201dHe watched over his fourth sister as she grew up. She was a timid girl, and always hid behind the other sisters. He couldn\u2019t see that she would be so vicious.When Song Heqing heard about it from Zhao Nanyu, he didn\u2019t believe it.Song Luan didn\u2019t understand his brother\u2019s intention to come to her for a while. Did he want to say two good words to her? Make fourth sister and her reconcile?\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my fourth sister to do such a thing.\u201d Song Luan looked at him and said, \u201cBut brother, who did you hear this from?\u201dSong Heqing vaguely replied, \u201cYour husband.\u201dAt first, he didn\u2019t know about it. Song Yu did it so covertly that Zhao Nanyu almost killed her.After Song Yu was caught in the temple, Song Heqing, as the eldest brother, couldn\u2019t bear to see his sister spend the rest of her life in the nunnery. He had intended to ask his father for mercy and protect Song Yu. However, she must not stay in the capital any longer. It was the best way to marry her far away.At this time, Zhao Nanyu came to visit him and told him what Song Yu had done.Although Song Heqing was very good to each sister, he preferred Song Luan most.Although the little girl was not very good in character, but when she was a child, she liked to plunge into his arms and act coquettish.Even though Song Luan\u2019s reputation was in a mess, in Song Heqing\u2019s eyes, these were nothing. His sister was still so beautiful. What\u2019s the matter with raising this kind of cute devil?In Song Heqing\u2019s opinion, the only fault of her sister was that she\u2019s too high-profile, and didn\u2019t know how to cover it at all.When Zhao Nanyu also told him about Song Luan\u2019s injury, Song Heqing was very angry. He didn\u2019t go to his father to plead for Song Yu, and even refused to take care of her.He was mainly concerned about his sister\u2019s injury. Was she okay? These days, Zhao Nanyu was resting in the palace. He certainly had no time to take care of her. At this point, Song Heqing was quite critical.No matter how many affairs were in the palace, Zhao Nanyu shouldn\u2019t have stayed away for more than ten days, leaving his sister alone!Her sister\u2019s fairy like figure should be spoiled in the palm of his hand.\u201cWhy does he tell you about this?\u201d Song Luan pouted, and said unhappily.Song Heqing gently coaxed her, \u201cOkay, Okay\u2026I just want to ask whether the wound on your body is already healed?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t feel any pain anymore. Zhao Nanyu probably added fuel to scare her brother, so she said in a sullen voice, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cGood? You didn\u2019t lie to your brother?\u201d\u201cDo I lie to you to get money? That\u2019s great.\u201d Song Luan felt more comfortable when she saw that her brother didn\u2019t want to mention Song Yu\u2019s words.She coughed twice, \u201cBrother, are you going to ask me this today?\u201dSong Heqing took out a small box from behind him and placed it in front of her. His chin nodded to its direction, indicating that she should open the small box.Song Luan took the key from his palm and opened the box with expectation. Her eyes were almost blinded by the gold and silver jewelry in it. She couldn\u2019t turn her eyes, and could only stare at the golden jewelry in the box. Her eyes narrowed into a slit, \u201cFor me?!\u201dSong Heqing couldn\u2019t help but looked at her wealthy little fan. \u201cYour mother asked me to bring it to you.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t put it down, and held the box tightly. \u201cMy mother is so nice!\u201dI had a doting mother. It\u2019s really nice to live!Song Heqing suddenly smiled, and looked at her seriously. Then, he said slowly, \u201cI think your mother still doesn\u2019t like Ah Yu very much. But in fact, I think he\u2019s good. He has a bright future. He\u2019s tolerant to you. If you have a chance, go persuade your mother\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu was rising in ranks. It was obvious that someone was deliberately trying to put him in a high position. Song Heqing felt that the man behind Zhao Nanyu was mostly the sixth prince.In the eyes of the emperor, it seemed that he had never been such a good person. He would never stop asking mocking questions to Zhao Nanyu. The emperor wouldn\u2019t even reward his meritorious deeds.If Zhao Nanyu made a mistake, he would be severely punished.But for a second thought, the sixth prince, who had just been granted the title of emperor, may not have the ability to make him jump to the position of the fourth grade official.Song Heqing couldn\u2019t figure it out. Anyway, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s rise to power was also good for the Song family.\u201cFrom the first day of my marriage, my mother wanted me to leave him.\u201d Song Luan said.Song Heqing was not surprised. Aunt Lin had only had money and power in her eyes. She thought that the most noble man in the world was worthy of her daughter. It was no wonder that such a person was not satisfied with just Zhao Nanyu.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dSong Luan looked out of the window at the sky. On the high eaves stood groups of birds chirping happily. Her eyes were suddenly sad. She suddenly realized that she still yearned for a free and normal life.She couldn\u2019t have any attachment to the repressed and overwhelming controlled life.Zhao Nanyu was a good man. He was beautiful. Song Luan had never seen a man more beautiful than him in her two lives. He had a bright future, and the best fortune. He had no other shortcomings except being arrogant and ruthless.But it was precisely Zhao Nanyu\u2019s defect character that Song Luan couldn\u2019t tolerate.Strong love would trap her.She didn\u2019t want to be a pretty girl in a cage.Song Luan felt that it was time to reveal her heart to her brother. She said one word at a time, \u201cI also want to leave.\u201dSong Heqing was surprised that he blurted out and asked her, \u201cAre you willing to part with your son?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t give him up.He was such a good boy.Song Luan was dejected and murmured in a low voice. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201dThere was no way that the Zhao family would let her take her son to the Song family.Song Heqing felt a headache. He rubbed his eyebrows and swallowed his saliva. He asked her tentatively, \u201cAh Luan, are you\u2026cough\u2026are you fascinated by other men outside?\u201dHe then added, \u201cWell, what you want to do, your brother won\u2019t stop you, but there is a limit to everything. Don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201dSong Luan was shocked by Song Heqing\u2019s three views.\u201cIt has nothing to do with other men,\u201d she explained. \u201cI can\u2019t get along with him!\u201d\u201cDo you really mean to leave?\u201d\u201cWell, after the Chinese New Year. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201dAfter the end of the year, court affairs would already be settled.Song Heqing also wanted to persuade her with two more words, but seeing that she was determined, he closed his mouth and stopped talking.Personally, he still felt that there was room for the couple to turn around. And what he didn\u2019t say was that Zhao Nanyu might not want her to leave.Men are also very keen at looking at other men. Zhao Nanyu looked at his sister like a wolf every time.How could he let someone go easily?The two brothers and sisters had lunch together in the restaurant. Song Luan also drank a glass of wine, so she was a little dizzy, and had a faint blush in her cheeks. She was out for a while that her temperature on her face dropped.Song Heqing sent her to the carriage while delivering a message that her mother wanted to convey to her: \u201cYou should pay more attention to your health. Don\u2019t eat or play too much. You can rest assured that I am on your side always. I will take care of you.\u201dMoreover, aunt Lin lived a very happy and comfortable life. She fiddled with treasures all day long, and went to shops to buy new clothes.Song Luan nodded, \u201cI know. Brother, you should also take care of yourself. Do not try to be brave.\u201dAfter the new emperor ascends the throne, she didn\u2019t know what would happen to the Song family, but it would certainly be better than the original book. They would not end up in exile.Song Heqing grinned and touched her head. \u201cYou also take care of yourself.\u201dAfter a visit, Song Luan\u2019s mood was relieved greatly. She jumped on the snow and played by herself. The red embroidered shoes deliberately left footprints one after another in the snow.Song Luan walked several times in the snow until she noticed that her shoes were wet, so she reluctantly returned to the yard.When she came into the room, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s was already there. He was wearing a crescent colored tunic and a small sachet hanging from his belt. His eyebrows and eyes looked very picturesque.Little Zhao was lying on his shoulder with the corners of his mouth turned down, and his mood seemed to be depressed.Song Luan went over and picked up little Zhao from his arms and pinched his tender cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLittle Zhao was embarrassed to say it. It was because his father did not let him go out to play snow. He was just unhappy.Zhao Nanyu coughed and said, \u201cDoing as he pleases.\u201dSong Luan ignored Zhao Nanyu and patiently asked her son, \u201cWhat do you want to do? say it to mother.\u201dHe lowered his voice and whispered in her ear, \u201cI want to make a snowman, but my father won\u2019t let me.\u201dZhao Nanyu explained for himself, \u201cHe will be sick again if he plays today. It\u2019s snowing very hard.\u201d\u201cSo it is.\u201d She lowered her head and gently coaxed the child, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get sick, do you?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d He put his arm around her neck, \u201cOkay, I see, mom.\u201dHe looked at his mother. Since she liked to make many little snowman, he want to send her one. He didn\u2019t have any interest in playing.\u201cWell, don\u2019t pester your mother all the time. You haven\u2019t finished your homework.\u201d\u201cFather, I know. I\u2019m going.\u201dLittle Zhao jumped to the ground, and was led by a maidservant to the study of the front yard.Song Luan\u2019s arms were empty, and she was not used to it for a while.Zhao Nanyu, with sharp eyes, looked at Song Luan\u2019s soaked toe and asked, \u201cWhy are your shoes wet?\u201d\u201cAh? Really? I didn\u2019t notice either.\u201d Song Luan looked down and pretended not to know.Zhao Nanyu took her to the bedside and sat down. He squatted in front of her and took off her shoes. Her socks were wet, and he sighed, \u201cHow old are you? Why do you still play?\u201dSong Luan was not very comfortable. She tried to take her little feet back. \u201cGet up, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dZhao Nanyu pinched her thin white ankle and took off her socks. Seeing her her tender white feet, his eyes turned dim and he gave her a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201dHe found a pair of clean socks and slowly put them on for her. Song Luan could see his fair face as soon as he lowered his head. The man looked sacred, as if he was doing a very important thing.After putting on her socks, Zhao Nanyu took a pair of shoes for her and put them under the bed. She said softly, \u201cNow it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re husband and wife, don\u2019t be so polite.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s psychological pressure suddenly increased a lot. Why did she feel that he was taking the initiative!? Why did I sense that his meaning was getting deeper and deeper!?\u201cAren\u2019t you busy?\u201dZhao Nanyu was silent, after a while, he raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m almost busy.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t care about him. She just wanted to get some information about the palace from his mouth, such as whether the emperor already decided on a prince?She hesitated and continued, \u201cToday I heard from my brother that the situation is unstable and the emperor had killed many people. Will you be okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t affect me.\u201d Zhao Nanyu said with a smile.Seeing that he couldn\u2019t pry things out of his mouth, Song Luan laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re okay, that\u2019s good.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s lips rose in a good mood.When it was time to have dinner, the doctor that Zhao Nanyu asked for had arrived.The doctor was followed by a little boy. They came here on foot, so their bodies were shaking from cold. Zhao Nanyu told the maidservants to pour a cup of hot water for them and then went into the inner room.Song Luan\u2019s face was hidden in the quilt, and was sleeping sweetly. She hadn\u2019t woken up from her afternoon nap, when Zhao Nanyu approached her and pulled her out of the quilt. \u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up.\u201dSong Luan opened her eyes vaguely, and looked up. It was dark outside the window. Slowly, she got up from the quilt and found two people sitting outside who she had never seen before.\u201cAre these two\u2026?\u201d\u201cDoctors.\u201d Zhao Nanyu replied, and said, \u201cJust regular visits. You don\u2019t have to be afraid.\u201dWhen he said this, Song Luan was relieved. She thought that there was something wrong with her failing body. She was very cooperative and handed her hand to the doctor so they could feel the pulse.The room was quiet and only the breathing could be heardAfter a long time, Song Luan only heard him say, \u201cCongratulations, madam. This is the pulse of joy.\u201dShe hadn\u2019t recovered for a long time, and her brain was confused by his words. Later, when the doctor and Zhao Nanyu said something, she didn\u2019t listen to anything at all.Zhao Nanyu was more calm than her. He rewarded the doctor with a large amount of silver, and ordered people to send the doctor out of the house.Song Luan swallowed her mouth, opened her eyes wide, and looked at him, \u201cAm I pregnant?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were filled with an imperceptible smile. The corner of his lips were raised, and whispered, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow can I get pregnant? I\u2026I\u2026I drank bozi soup before, and..and\u2026\u201d She was incoherent and didn\u2019t know what she was saying.Zhao Nanyu put his hand on her shoulder, as if sensing her uneasiness and fear. He said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a good thing?\u201dWas it a good thing? Was it really a good thing? Song Luan\u2019s brain was confused, but she couldn\u2019t say that she didn\u2019t want children.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s smile gradually stiffened, \u201cI want little Zhao to have a sister, don\u2019t you like it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201dHe said coldly, \u201cYou\u2019re going to raise a baby well.\u201dSong Luan wanted to say all the thousand words in her throat, but could only call out his name, \u201cZhao Nanyu.\u201d\u201cGo and talk. I will listen.\u201d Zhao Nanyu could see Song Luan\u2019s love for little Zhao, so he knew she would treat her future children well. He also really wanted a willful and lovely girl that resembled like Song Luan.Song Luan wanted to tell him that she didn\u2019t like having a child.She even had some indescribable joy in her heart.When she was about to speak, she felt like she just swallowed it back to her stomach.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerThe news of Song Luan\u2019s pregnancy was not hidden. Third lady Zhao and old lady Zhao soon learned about it, and they sent a lot of supplements.Although these actions made Song Luan nervous, she was nevertheless, happy. Third lady Zhao had nothing to do, so she stewed soup and sent them everyday to her residence. When she remembered how Song Luan treated herself by going on a hunger strike when she was pregnant with little Zhao, she was afraid that she would be silly again, and came to her residence to talk to her.\u201cDid the doctor say how many months the baby has been?\u201dAt this time, Song Luan\u2019s abdomen was still very flat, there was no sign of pregnancy yet.She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dShe was so dizzy that she didn\u2019t have time to ask.Third lady Zhao sighed again, clenched her hand, and said to her, \u201cThe first three months are the most important. I was very careful when I was pregnant with Ah Yan, and I didn\u2019t dare to move when I was laying in bed.\u201dSong Luan touched her stomach and felt a strange feeling in her heart. She was pregnant with a new life in her body. It was amazing.Third lady Zhao laughed, looked at her face, and continued, \u201cLook at all the nonsense I\u2019ve said, you have also given birth to children. I am sure you already understood this.\u201dSong Luan whispered back, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll pay attention.\u201dAt first, It was a little difficult to accept when she knew she was pregnant, but after a few days had passed, her mood gradually calmed down. Apart from being a little more tied up with Zhao Nanyu, she was still happy about the arrival of her new child.When the third lady saw that she listened to her words, she was very pleased.She drank a cup of hot water, pondered for a moment, and then said, \u201cAh Luan, I can see that A Yu has no place in your heart. Even though I am not his biological mother, I have watched him for so many years. I know the nature of this child best.\u201dShe slowly added, \u201cAlthough Ah Yu is stubborn, I can see that he really likes you, loves you, and wants to live a good life with you.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t expect that third lady Zhao would talk about this to her. She was surprised and embarrassed, as if her mind could be easily seen through.Third lady Zhao laughed. \u201cYou know that I don\u2019t have a close relationship with Ah Yu. He seldom comes to me. The day before yesterday, he came to talk to me for the first time. He was unsure if you want the child, and he told me to come and persuade you.\u201dSong Luan whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want this child.\u201dThird lady Zhao\u2019s smile deepened and she held her hand harder. \u201cI think so too, but how can a mother not like her children? A small life is hidden in your stomach. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late to be happy.\u201d\u201cI misunderstood him. I thought he didn\u2019t like children.\u201dIn the original book, Zhao Nanyu had no other offspring in his life, other than little Zhao.\u201cIt\u2019s true that Ah Yu is a bit cold tempered, but I think he will like it as long as you give birth to it.\u201dSong Luan was relieved. Now it\u2019s useless for her to think about the every details of this book. Before, she always separated herself from the world, just like spectator who only knew all the endings in advance. This child in her stomach made her more aware that she was in a real world.Everyone has his own destiny and his own belonging.With the condition of her body, the servant girls became more careful when they waited on her.Song Luan originally wanted to make two small clothes for her unborn baby, however, her needlework skills were so poor that she had no choice but to give up the idea.But grandma Lin\u2019s needlework was unique. These days, she had begun to sew shoes and socks for her unborn child.Song Luan had no interest in these things, but this time she looked down on the side of grandma Lin, like a curious child, \u201cIs this sewing too small?\u201dSocks looked smaller than her palm, could her future baby wear this?Grandma Lin said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s still big.\u201d\u201cAh? I\u2019m also worried that the child won\u2019t fit in!\u201d Song Luan didn\u2019t know what she was thinking about. Suddenly she began to smile and squint.\u201dIt\u2019s okay. Little Zhao can wear this.\u201dGrandma Lin didn\u2019t speak. She bent her head and sewed the socks in her hand. After her madam had a baby, her heart became naive. Little Zhao couldn\u2019t wear these socks.The day before the Spring Festival, there was a custom to hold the lantern festival in the capital.Song Luan clamored to go out after knowing of this. She did not dare to sneak out of the house rashly this time, after all, she still had a baby in her stomach.Fortunately, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t intend to arrest her this time. He wrapped her up like a dumpling and took her out of the door. Zhao residence was not far from the street full of lanterns, but he insisted that she go by carriage.Song Luan was a little reluctant. She was not happy when she lost her face, and discussed with him, \u201cCan we walk?\u201d\u201cThe snow has hardened the road. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll slip.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an adult! How can I not walk well?\u201dZhao Nanyu strained his face and pursed his lips.Song Luan pulled his sleeves, acted coquettish in front of him, and said in a soft voice. \u201cYou\u2019re here, can you just look at me?\u201dZhao Nanyu blushed. He pressed his hands to her lips. With a low \u201chum\u201d voice, he took her hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe street was full of colorful lanterns. On both sides of the street were full of stalls, and most of them sold lanterns. Each one was more beautiful than the other. The animals painted on them were vivid and dazzling.The little peddler had a nice accent, \u201cYoung master, do you want to buy a hairpin for your wife? The beauty of your wife is so beautiful that she must wear a hairpin.\u201dThere were all kinds of hairpins on the red cloth. They were chic in style and exquisite in workmanship, but most of them were made of silver.Song Luan\u2019s eyes looked around, picked out a silver butterfly-like hairpin, raised her face, and said to Zhao Nanyu, \u201cI want this one.\u201dZhao Nanyu, with long fingers, took out the hairpin and looked at it carefully. He looked gentle as he immediately inserted it into her hairbun.The two people were very close. Song Luan smelled his body, and her white tender ears turned red.She asked him, \u201cIs it beautiful?\u201dZhao Nanyu fixed her hair at the edge of her forehead and said, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201dSong Luan smiled, and asked the stall owner, \u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201c200 Wen.\u201dZhao Nanyu silently took an ingot of silver from the money bag and handed it to him, saying, \u201cNo need to give the change.\u201dSong Luan was in a good mood as long as she could go out to play. It was rare to be able to tease him, so she said, \u201cThis young master is really rich.\u201dZhao Nanyu rubbed her head with a smile and did not reply.Song Luan had been used to his reticence for a long time. It\u2019s okay if he didn\u2019t speak, because he always says something she doesn\u2019t want to hear.On this day, there were many young couples who went shopping with their children on the street, each with a bright smile on their faces.Through the long street, you can see an arch bridge. There were young girls standing on the bridge. Most of them were shy, but they came out to see the people they like.Song Luan saw an acquaintance on the bridge, who she never liked very much.It seems that the matchmaker didn\u2019t succeed in the several marriages he was arranged with.Zhao Chao was surrounded by a young girl with a round face, bright eyes, and perfect teeth. Her face looked as if it was flying in clouds. She looked down shyly, did not dare to look at him, and tightened her handkerchief.Zhao Chao\u2019s face was relaxed. If you look carefully, you could even see the impatience between his eyebrows. He didn\u2019t seem very interested in the girl in front of him.Zhao Chao was really tired. These days, his mother had been asking him endlessly to find a woman. She was very powerful and did not give him a chance to breathe.His eyelids looked at the woman in front of him boringly.Zhao Chao had a good eye for people, but he was also rather crafty. He was afraid that beautiful girls would have the same virtue as his second sister-in-law, but women with bad looks won\u2019t work either.A weak temper was no good, and a crying one would bore him to death. It was even worse if she was hot-tempered.So\u2026for one thing, Zhao Chao scared away many girls\u2019 homes. His mother was so angry that she didn\u2019t give him anything to eat.Zhao Chao was very fond of this girl at first. He liked her both in appearance and figure, but her personality was so boring that he couldn\u2019t spit out a word when they stood on the bridge for a moment.Gradually, Zhao Chao lost his patience.Song Luan stood at the head of the bridge, pointed to Zhao Chao not far away, and asked the man beside her, \u201cIs that girl your cousin likes?\u201dThe wind was still strong at the edge of the lake, Zhao Nanyu held her in his arms, and covered her with his cloak. He looked down at her and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. There\u2019s no one who likes to stand by and not move.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dSong Luan was in a good mood, and her complexion improved a lot. Her cheeks were white and red, and her red lips were moist, making one want to bite and taste.Song Luan opened her mouth and wanted to ask him about Zhao Chao. But who knew that the man in front of her would suddenly embraced her waist, and lead her to the corner.There was no lantern and candle light at the corner of the wall. Only by the light of the moon could people see what\u2019s in front of them.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart fluttered for a moment. His thin, white, and slender fingers ran across her cheek, and stopped on her chin.His lips were raised as he lowered her head, and took a bite on her lips.The kiss was not light or heavy, but it still gave Song Luan a slight tingling sensation. She inhaled and hissed.Zhao Nanyu lightly tasted her lips, and immediately released her chin. He licked his lips with satisfaction, and smirked as he laughed, \u201cSweet.\u201dSong Luan wiped her mouth and pounded his arms angrily, \u201cYou scared me!\u201dZhao Nanyu smiled, but as if he didn\u2019t taste enough, he pressed her shoulder and trapped her firmly on the wall. He couldn\u2019t help but kiss her again.This kiss was so delicate and touching that Song Luan\u2019s head swelled, and she almost couldn\u2019t breathe.Her little mouth was red and slightly swollen.Song Luan was so angry that she didn\u2019t want to pay attention to him. With a look of stinginess, she complained in a low voice, \u201cYou are so annoying.\u201dZhao Nanyu wanted to take her hand, but Song Luan was not willing to give him face, and shaked him off. \u201cI want to walk in front of you.\u201dIf she walked beside him, she may be caught in the dark again.Zhao Nanyu obediently followed her behind, but only kept less than a two-steps away.Before returning to the lakeside that they had been before, Song Luan ran into Zhao Chao.She looked at him coldly, and was unwilling to smile at him this time.Zhao Chao didn\u2019t expect to meet her here. He was surprised and said, \u201cSecond sister-in-law?\u201dHe was still wondering if Song Luan had taken advantage of the great festival and made an old mistake, hooking with three and four men.Zhao Chao looked at her, and his eyes gradually became cold. Seeing second elder brother on her back, he was stunned, \u201cSecond brother also came out.\u201dZhao Nanyu said, \u201cWell, she likes to have fun.\u201dZhao Chao found that his second brother seemed to be in a very good mood tonight. Zhao Nanyu had a smile on his eyes.Zhao Chao didn\u2019t go home these days. He stayed at his friend\u2019s house to take refuge, so he didn\u2019t know that Song Luan was pregnant.He said, \u201cDid second elder brother and second sister-in-law have dinner yet?\u201dZhao Nanyu said in a deep voice, \u201cNot yet.\u201dSong Luan was also a little hungry. Maybe because she had a baby in her stomach now, her mouth was very picky. She didn\u2019t want to eat anything that was too sweet, too spicy, too greasy or too bland.Three people went to the restaurant together. Song Luan couldn\u2019t wait to order the roast duck that she had been talking about for a long time. Her mouth was watering, and could almost flow out.Zhao Nanyu gently reminded her, \u201cBe careful. You might vomit again.\u201dSong Luan just wanted to eat it. \u201cI won\u2019t vomit.\u201dShe patted her stomach with a smile. \u201cThis child has been very good these two days, not making any trouble for me when I eat.\u201dIf she eats more, the baby would look better.Zhao Chao raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s second sister-in-law saying?\u201dZhao Nanyu answered for her, \u201cShe is pregnant.\u201dZhao Chao\u2019s eyes\u2026became delicate for a shortwhile. He looked at Song Luan with complicated eyes, it gradually went down, glanced at her abdomen, and then took back his eyes.He pulled up a farfetched smile, \u201cCongratulations, second brother.\u201dZhao Chao clenched his hand. There were a lot of words he had to say to his second brother, but since Song Luan was present, he composed himself.Zhao Chao looked at the joy of his second brother\u2019s face, and his heart sank.Song Luan was only thinking about her roast duck. She didn\u2019t pay any attention to the expression on Zhao Chao\u2019s face, but Zhao Nanyu saw it.His smile on his lips was stiff. His intuition told him that Zhao Chao wanted to say something to him, and it wouldn\u2019t be good words.Zhao Chao quietly said two words to him\u2013tianqing.Zhao Nanyu suddenly stopped, and stiffened.He almost forgot that Song Luan\u2019s body still had the residual poison of tianqing that he once used as poisoned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerWhen Zhao Nanyu knew about Song Luan\u2019s pregnancy that day, he was only happy and just asked the doctor what he needed to pay attention to. He forgot about the matter of poison.At the beginning, he wanted to slowly torture her to death, so he put the poison in her body. He didn\u2019t think at first to give Song Luan a way out to live, but now, it self-inflicted himself.Song Luan suddenly felt that the man\u2019s face became ugly. She turned her head to look at him.She found that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was a little pale, his body was stiff, and his eyes were covered with thin blood. She asked him funnily, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t even dare to look at her. His voice was hoarse. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dHe touched her head and said in a soft voice, \u201cThere will be fireworks under the gate in a moment. Do you want to see it?\u201dSong Luan put her chin in his hands. Her legs were still shaking with excitement, and her eyes were bright, as she laughed and said, \u201cYes.\u201dShe had not seen what the ancient fireworks looked like, nor did she know that this world would be so lively with fireworks.\u201cI\u2019ll let you go out first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan also saw that he and the Zhao Chao seemed to have something to talk about, and that he deliberately pushed her away.However, she didn\u2019t care much about what the cousins wanted to talk. It was more comfortable for her to play alone.She stood up and clapped her hands. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go to see the fireworks first.\u201dZhao Nanyu called his guard in. He was a very ordinary looking man with a thumb sized scar on his forehead. His facial features were sharp, and looked a little fierce. He told his guard, \u201cTake my wife to the window sill and take good care of her.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter Song Luan went out, Zhao Nanyu was silent for a long time, and didn\u2019t open his mouth.Zhao Chao frowned and didn\u2019t know where to start. Of course, he hated Song Luan. His prejudice was deep-rooted and wouldn\u2019t be eliminated by just her changes in the past few months.What\u2019s more, Zhao Chao didn\u2019t expect Song Luan to get pregnant. His second brother didn\u2019t seem to be someone who loves children.After deliberation, Zhao Chao opened his mouth and said in a low voice, \u201cSecond brother, I\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his head and poured a glass of wine into his throat. His eyes were fierce and he interrupted him cleanly. He asked, \u201cWhen will your master return to the capital?\u201dZhao Chao was speechless. His master was a taoist who traveled all over the world. He lived in no fixed place every year, even he couldn\u2019t him.When he got the news last time, he only had time to write a letter asking about tianqing\u2019s antidote.He didn\u2019t get an answer, and his master disappeared again.He shook his head and hesitated, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this. The old man rarely sends me news. I have checked his medical books before, but still can\u2019t find the solution.\u201dIt was originally a poison made by his master on a whim. He had not even used it on people before, so he didn\u2019t prepare an antidote. However, Zhao Chao saw in his own eyes the effect of the poison experimented on small animals. Those animals slowly exhausted their vitality, died of depression, and suffered from death.He comforted himself that Song Luan didn\u2019t intake much, and the amount was not enough. She should be saved, but he was afraid that his master would be the only one who knows about the antidote.Zhao Nanyu crushed the cup in his hand. The sharp porcelain pieces cut his fingers, and the bright red beads of blood dripped down from his hands. His face was pale, his facial features were slightly ferocious, and his red eyes stared at Zhao Chao.His voice was hoarse and he felt pain, \u201cDo you have any way to detoxify it completely?\u201dZhao Chao couldn\u2019t lie. He lowered his head and whispered, \u201cI can only wait for my master to come back.\u201dZhao Nanyu gave a low smile, it looked quite penetrating. He clenched his fingers into fist and smashed it on the table. He lost his posture and roared in a low voice, \u201cSo when will your master come back?!\u201dThe answer for this was already expected. Zhao Nanyu had been looking for taoist priest, and almost all the guards had been sent out just to find the taoist, but there still had been no news.Suddenly his wrist had no strength. He sat on the chair with a dispirited face, and he gasped slightly. His throat was hoarse, \u201cWhat will happen?\u201dZhao Chao was dumbfounded for a moment. He was not happy to see his second brother like this. After all, Song Luan\u2019s baby in her stomach was also his second brother\u2019s flesh and blood.\u201cYou know, second sister-in-law is weak, and the remaining poison in her body had been suppressed by drugs. The child will be born with poison. Whether the baby can live or not, or whether their limbs are intact or not, are all variables. Moreover\u2026\u201dHe stopped suddenly and didn\u2019t go on.Zhao Nanyu took a sip of the cold tea that had been cooled off, and then he said, \u201cMoreover?\u201dZhao Chao lowered his eyes and said in a low voice, \u201cAnd the problem is not whether the child is healthy or not, it\u2019s whether second sister-in-law can survive this childbirth.\u201dSong Luan was short of Qi and blood. She had an accident when she gave birth to little Zhao. The most important thing was that, Song Luan\u2019s body was not as good as it was four years ago.Judging from his second brother\u2019s deep love for Song Luan, he was afraid that he couldn\u2019t accept losing Song Luan.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t speak, or maybe because he couldn\u2019t speak. His heart seemed to be squeezed tightly. He was gloomy as he felt he was being choked by air.He didn\u2019t give up and asked, \u201cIs there really no way?\u201dZhao Chao didn\u2019t answer, \u201cSecond brother, how much do you like her?\u201dHow much did he like her? Before, he was a person who once hoped that she would die early, but now, her arrogance, willfulness, and occasional tantrums had become very cute.He wanted to have a firm grip on her life, and let her live in the world he made.She liked silk, gold, silver and jewelry, so he wanted to bring all of them to her eyes.\u201cI want her.\u201d Zhao Nanyu only answered these three words.Zhao Chao was surprised, but still had regrets. His second brother was still planted in Song Luan\u2019s hands.He raised his eyes, looked straight at his second brother, and said in a low voice, \u201cSecond brother, this child can\u2019t be kept.\u201dEven if Song Luan gave birth to the baby safely, she may die within a few months, or even die while giving birth. A newborn baby would definitely unable to resist the toxicity of tianqing, and no amount of antidote would do anything about it.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s smile had become worse, \u201cIs there really no way? I don\u2019t care what the baby looks like. I\u2019ll take care of him for the rest of my life.\u201dThese days, he could also see that Song Luan has this child in her heart. She even learned how to make socks and shoes for the baby. She also had more smiles on her face.Song Luan didn\u2019t like him very much, but if he asked her to abort the child, she would really hate him.Zhao Chao also knew that his second brother was reluctant to give one of them up. Now he regretted giving the poison to his second brother, because it made everything difficult to recover.He said, \u201cListen to me, second brother..\u201d after a pause, he said, \u201cSecond sister-in-law couldn\u2019t stand this poison.\u201dIf the poison couldn\u2019t be cured, her body wouldn\u2019t recover.In any case, the child was not allowed to survive.Zhao Nanyu nodded numbly, \u201cI know.\u201dCompared with the unborn child, he couldn\u2019t risk losing Song Luan.On second thought, it was not a bad thing to be hated by Song Luan. Her love for him was not deep enough, it was her hatred that was deep. She would remember him for the rest of her life.For the rest of his life, he would only be nice to her.***Zhao Nanyu did not cheat her, the gate of the city was really setting off fireworks.The wind was strong at night, Song Luan was standing in the window sill. Her crimson dress was fluttering with the wind, and she felt a little cold.Under the restaurant in the street, there were a lot of people looking up at the fireworks. This scene was more lively than any other ordinary festivals.She leaned on the railing, and one man stood behind her, like a door guard.The ladies of the aristocratic families around her did not dare approach her. Song Luan rubbed her hands with cold fingers, and she was planning to go back inside the room.As she turned around, she was met with a familiar face.Huai Jin was dressed in red clothes, and his excessively beautiful face was particularly dazzling in the crowd. He was about to rush to her, but was stopped by the strong man beside Song Luan.Huai Jin\u2019s thin arm and legs naturally couldn\u2019t twist the ferocious bodyguard. Song Luan coughed twice, \u201cLet him go.\u201dThe bodyguard let go of Huai Jin.Song Luan thought that Huai Jin looked like a homeless child at the moment, waiting for her every day.She went up to him, looked at him, and sighed, \u201cDid you come all the way here?\u201dHuai Jin nodded honestly. Although he was timid, he would not lose his memory even if he was beaten!Song Luan laughed out with a loud voice. No matter which aspect she looks, Huai Jin looked like a young boy.She came up to him and said, \u201cHuai Jin, don\u2019t you have something you want to do?\u201dHe always followed her, but didn\u2019t have his own life.Huai Jin pursed the corners of his lips. His original home was in Nanman, but it was destroyed long ago.After being sold, he already had planned to spend his life in a muddle.But later it was Song Luan who fished him out of the mud. He would never forget her bright and dazzling appearance when she stood in front of him.Huai Jin just wanted to follow her. He had a mean mouth, and also had no other friends.He didn\u2019t feel happy to celebrate the new year.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know what I want to do.\u201dSong Luan frowned, \u201cDo you miss learning?\u201dHuai Jin shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t need to.\u201d\u201cDo you want to do your own business?\u201d\u201cWell, this sounds good.\u201d Huai Jin remembered that Ah Luan\u2019s favorite thing was money!Song Luan was relieved and asked, \u201cAre you rich?\u201dHuai Jin nodded heavily and said, \u201cOf course, I have saved a lot of money in recent years, although it is still not comparable to your small treasury.\u201dSong Luan laughed happily. \u201cThen you can open a shop. When you meet a girl you like, marry her, and live a good life.\u201dHuai Jin pretended that he didn\u2019t hear anything. He lowered his head and looked at his shoe tips.Song Luan touched her flat stomach, and said, \u201cHuai Jin, I have a baby again. You don\u2019t have to worry about my life. I treat you as a friend, so naturally, I hope you can live well in the future.\u201dShe really did not want to have any more emotional involvement with other men. Zhao Nanyu was enough for her.T/N: Ah guys\u2026This chapter is tooo long, so I have to divide it in two. Nevertheless, I hope you guys enjoyed!( \u02d8\u03c9\u02d8 ).

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerShe really did not want to have any more emotional involvement with other men. Zhao Nanyu was enough for her.Moreover, she was scared with Zhao Nanyu, but from beginning to end, she only treated Huai Jin only as an ignorant younger brother, without the kind of love between men and women.Huai Jin raised his head, his eyes were wide, \u201cWhat? What are you talking about!?\u201dSong Luan repeated with a smile, \u201cWell, I have a baby again, so you can see that I have a good life. Don\u2019t worry about me. You are still young. It\u2019s important to live your own life well.\u201dHuai Jin stared at her stomach indignantly. He hated Zhao Nanyu, hated that hypocrite! He just thought that Zhao Nanyu wasn\u2019t worthy of Song Luan, even though when these two people stand together, they looked like a good match.He reached out his hand to touch her stomach, but it only fell in the air. He took it back immediately for fear of hurting her.He murmured discontentedly, \u201cYou see\u2026what did I say at the beginning!\u201dAt that time, he should have worked hard to persuade Song Luan to throw something on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face.The more Huai Jin thought about it, the more angry he was. Now Song Luan had a child again, so she couldn\u2019t escape anymore.\u201cWell, well, don\u2019t be angry. Go back and think about opening a shop.\u201d She looked kindly at Huai Jin, and then said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cold, you should wear more clothes when you go out.\u201dHuai Jin turned his back angrily, \u201cIf you drive me away, I will never pay attention to you again.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t go after him. If Huai Jin would listened to what she said, it would be a good thing.When she went back, Zhao Nanyu was the only one left in the room. As for Zhao Chao, she didn\u2019t know where he went.Song Luan didn\u2019t care where he was, so she didn\u2019t even bother to ask.She yawned lazily, threw a peanut into her mouth, and ate it. She asked, \u201cWhen are we going back to the residence?\u201dZhao Nanyu pinched her wrist, which made her feel some pain. His eyes were slightly red, and it somewhat resembled a pool of blood. It was frightening to see.Song Luan asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhao Nanyu choked, and it took a long time to say, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Are you tired?\u201dSong Luan said, \u201cYes, I want to go back to sleep.\u201d and then added, her words suddenly became softer, \u201cMaybe there is a baby in my stomach, but these days, I\u2019ve been sleeping more than staying awake. I even eat more than before. I think I have gained a lot of weight.\u201dZhao Nanyu listened to her patiently. His heart became more and more uncomfortable, and his chest seemed to be blocked by something.\u201cYou\u2019re not fat. You still look beautiful.\u201dSong Luan blushed and said with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201dZhao Nanyu reluctantly smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not lying to you. You can look at yourself.\u201dHer facial features\u2026he likes everything.When he went down the stairs, Song Luan secretly held his hand. Zhao Nanyu stopped for a moment and immediately held her more tightly.It was still early, so the streets outside were still busy.The two of them walked hand in hand. As they approached the gate of the Zhao\u2019s residence, Song Luan suddenly stopped and stood in front of Zhao Nanyu.She raised her neck so she could see his eyes clearly.Song Luan took the initiative to plunge into his arms. She put her hands around his waist, sniffed his fragrance, and closed her eyes, \u201cWell, I\u2019m really happy today.\u201dAnd she gently whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe was willing to take her out to play, and was also patient with her.Zhao Nanyu stroked her hair. Before he could open his mouth, Song Luan then said, \u201cIf you are not strict with me in the future and often take me out to play, I may like you a little more every day.\u201dIf Zhao Nanyu heard these words in normal days, his mood would certainly be very good, but tonight he was so heavy that he couldn\u2019t even pretend to smile.He had to answer one word, \u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Nanyu hadn\u2019t figured out how to tell Song Luan about the baby, but the longer he drags on, the deeper Song Luan would feel for the unborn child.Song Luan suddenly thought, it seems that this life with Zhao Nanyu was not so terrible. What if she could change him? Won\u2019t let him become ruthless in the end just like in the original book?She admitted that the presence of the child did put some of her thoughts away.Song Luan figured out some things, and her mind became broad-minded.Tonight, she thought that Zhao Nanyu was even more beautiful, more pleasing to the eye, and looked more white and tender.She stood on tiptoes and gave him a dragonfly-like kiss on his lips. Her face was not thick enough, so after kissing, she blushed and her neck felt tensed.Zhao Nanyu bent his lips, but his smile only contained bitterness.***That night, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t say the word \u2018abort the child\u2019He only sat in his study until the dawn came.The next day, his eyes were red, and he was a little stressed.Zhao Nanyu was exhausted as he walked to the bedroom, and opened a small box. Inside, there were clothes for children that he had ordered his servants to prepare in advance. His fingers caressed them and his fingertips trembled slightly.Zhao Nanyu looked coldly at it, and locked all these clothes into the box. He would never open it again in his life.Eternal pain is not better than short pain. It was better for Song Luan to hear this news as early as she could.He took a heavy step, seemingly felt his feet was filled with heavy lead, as it slowly moved towards her residence.Song Luan was lying on the rocking chair in the courtyard, covered with a thin blanket. The warm sunlight fell gently on her face. She looked at ease, as if she had gone to sleep.Zhao Nanyu sat down beside her, did not wake her up, and only quietly looked at her. He bent down to her eyebrows, and gave a kiss.Song Luan opened her eyes and looked at him hazily.Zhao Nanyu asked, \u201cDid I wake you up?\u201dSong Luan shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m dreaming!\u201d\u201cWhat dream did you have? even sweetly laughing.\u201d\u201cI dreamt that the child kicked me!\u201dHow could a child who was only two-months-old kick people? Dreams are just dreams.Zhao Nanyu lowered his eyes, \u201cIs that right?\u201dSong Luan was pregnant for the first time, she didn\u2019t understand anything, and she felt everything was fresh. She touched her stomach happily, \u201cDon\u2019t look at the baby as a small one now. I think he must be very skinny in the future.\u201dSong Luan took his hand and put it on her stomach. She said happily, \u201cTry to see if the baby will say hello to you.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s hand stayed on it for a long time. \u201cThis baby can\u2019t kick people yet.\u201dSong Luan replied, \u201cI know. I just want you to say hello to him in advance. Talk to him more, and he will be close to you in the future.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were still full of pain, but Song Luan couldn\u2019t see his heart. She could not see the words in his eyes. \u201cAh luan, we don\u2019t want this child.\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask her if it was okay, because he had already made up his mind.Song Luan was dumbfounded for a long time, and she was stupefied. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dWhat do you mean by no?It was foolish. Who doesn\u2019t want a new life blooming in their stomach?Zhao Nanyu dreaded her gaze, and avoided it. He swallowed his throat, his voice was bitter, and said sourly, \u201cThis child\u2026really we can\u2019t keep it.\u201dT/N: Proofread this only once! so if you see any mistakes, please lemme know! also, i\u2019m sorry i couldn\u2019t reply to your comments in the last chapter, my mom broke her knee and needed immediate surgery.

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan admired herself that she could asked him calmly, \u201cWhy?\u201dZhao Nanyu hugged her tightly as he clenched his teeth. He explained to her very slowly, \u201cI asked the doctor. You are not in good health.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t breathe. Her face was as white as paper. She wanted to break free from his arms. However, the man\u2019s strength was so strong that she was trapped in his arms. \u201cIs that why?\u201dShe didn\u2019t believe it very much. It was true that she was weak, and was suffering from many diseases. But these days, she had been taking the medicine well. She was not like that time when she fainted because of chest tightness.\u201cWe won\u2019t keep the baby. I can\u2019t risk your life.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s red eyes blinked as she stared at him, \u201cI am not so vulnerable, I will not have any accidents.\u201dShe raised her face and tried not to let the crystal clear tears fall from her eyes, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s always you who are making decisions. This time it\u2019s my turn to make my own decisions.\u201dZhao Nanyu guessed that she would not compromise easily, so he gritted his teeth and continued, \u201cYou are obedient.\u201dHe reached out his finger and wiped the water from the corner of her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s enough that we are both still alive.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s nose and throat were sour that she couldn\u2019t speak. The hot tears rolled down one by one, and they couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you listen? Yeah!? Why is it up to you to decide everything, and everything is up to you?\u201dThis child was only a little old in her stomach. How could she have the heart to give this baby up because of his words or the doctor\u2019s words?She lifted her sleeve, wiped her tears, and sobbed. \u201cI will take good medicine, and take good care of myself. I promise you that there will be no problems with me and the baby.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were flushed. While holding her, he said slowly, \u201cWe still have little Zhao. I can\u2019t risk losing your life.\u201dAfter thinking about it, Zhao Nanyu touched her cheek and said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if I can\u2019t have more children, but I can\u2019t bear to lose you.\u201dSong Luan pulled the corners of her mouth and sarcastically laughed.She nodded silently, and tried again to smile at him, but it was uglier and came across as sardonic.She asked, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get better all my life, will I never have children again? If I accidentally get pregnant again, it will still be the same situation again. Every time I get pregnant, I have to run away?\u201dZhao Nanyu shook his hand and hugged her tightly, as if he never wanted to let go. His heart was in pain. His throat ached and his brain swelled. \u201cI don\u2019t like children very much. Little Zhao is enough for us.\u201dOne child is enough.From now on, he would never think about having a daughter.Nothing in this world was more important than her life.Song Luan\u2019s heart was as gray as death, and her expression was numbed as she was encircled in his arms. Her eyes were blank and she looked empty at the distance sky. Her eyes could not shed tears.Suddenly she remembered that this body was poisoned. Although she knew all the details, she had asked Zhao Nanyu who had poisoned her before.There was no antidote for the poison in her body. These days, Zhao Nanyu said that she liked her, but he didn\u2019t show any intention of giving her the antidote.Song Luan touched her stomach and laughed bitterly. It\u2019s not long since she yknew her unborn child. She gradually accepted, and even expected the child\u2019s arrival, but she will soon be unable to keep her.Song Luan closed her eyes, and she was still very sad. She was also learning how to take care of her children these days.She wondered whether this baby was a boy or a girl. She wanted to prepare a lot of beautiful clothes for her baby. She wanted to make this baby look beautiful in the future.But this dream, was personally crushed by Zhao Nanyu.Song Luan\u2019s heart suddenly filled with an inexplicable hatred. If Zhao Nanyu hadn\u2019t poisoned her, her body wouldn\u2019t have fallen into such a state, and her child wouldn\u2019t be implicated.Before that, she had thought that she would stay by his side in the future, even if they were not deeply in love, because they already had two children.Life needs to run her out and destroy her happiness.For a long time, she thought she and Zhao Nanyu could get along well.But now she suddenly did not think so. If Zhao Nanyu insisted on banishing the child, she wouldn\u2019t even have the room to resist, since her hands couldn\u2019t even bind a chicken.In the past, Song Luan, an outsider, didn\u2019t empathize with the characters in the book, and didn\u2019t even understand this original owner\u2019s behavior. She felt hypocrital. And when she became the person in the book, she found that everything was so helpless.This matter regarding her child would become a thorn in her heart, which could never be pulled out. It would be inserted into her heart quietly, and would forever hurt her.She would need no reason to hate Zhao Nanyu, because just seeing other people\u2019s children would make her remember that they once had this baby.Song Luan opened her eyes and said, \u201cZhao Nanyu, are you sure you won\u2019t regret it?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dSong Luan gave a weak smile and said twice, \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201dAs expected, he was a man who treats his own flesh and blood with the same ruthlessness.***In the evening, abortion medicine had been decocted in the kitchen, and a bowl of it was carried into her room by the maidservant.Zhao Nanyu took the bowl and put it on the table. He didn\u2019t sleep all day. The blood in his eyes became more and more serious. He kept silent and looked at the woman sitting on the bed.Song Luan wore a thin tunic. She was holding her legs as she shrinked in the corner of the wall. At that time, she was so tired that she actually went to sleep.Song Luan\u2019s sleeping was very strange.She didn\u2019t know that she had been talking in her sleep, and her words were endless and incomprehensible.Song Luan hugged herself, and felt cold all over her body. Her eyes were swollen, and she looked pitiful.Zhao Nanyu took the medicine and went to the bedside. His face was so pale. The soup in his hand was still steaming hot. He opened his lips and whispered, \u201cTake the medicine.\u201dAfter a long time, Song Luan raised her face and looked at him with grape-like black eyes. Her white wrist stretched out from the quilt with trembling fingers.Zhao Nanyu sighed softly and sat down beside her, \u201cI\u2019ll feed you\u201dSong Luan swallowed a lump on her throat, her shoulder subconsciously hid, and she pitifully whispered, \u201cCan I not drink?\u201dZhao Nanyu said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll be with you.\u201dOf course, he must taste the bitter fruit he planted himself.Song Luan tried to avoid when the medicine was fed to her mouth. She lowered her face and put her hand on her abdomen. \u201cI\u2019ll drink it in two days. I want to stay with this baby more.\u201dIt was just a slip of tongue, so she couldn\u2019t drink the bowl of medicine.Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t dare to be cruel to her, so he didn\u2019t force her too hard. He put the medicine back on the table and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dHe added, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t eat much at noon, so she should be hungry now.She shook her head and said bitterly, \u201cDo you think I can eat it now?\u201dZhao Nanyu sighed, \u201cIf you have no appetite, you still have to eat. What should you do if you are hungry?\u201dSong Luan snorted and didn\u2019t want to talk to him.Zhao Nanyu was not annoyed. He told the maidservants to bring in the dinner. Song Luan didn\u2019t even look at it. But after a while, she realized that it was her own baby who was starving.She picked up her chopsticks and ate two mouthfuls of rice, though she still didn\u2019t eat much.Zhao Nanyu seemed to have no appetite. His chopsticks stopped at the same time she stopped.[After dinner]Song Luan didn\u2019t want to pay more attention to him, so he disappeared from her eyes.Not long after he left, Song Luan got out of bed slowly. Her legs were weak. She moved to the dresser step by step, and took out the locked box with some strength.There were all her valuable jewelry, mostly gold ornaments, with some cash.The box was very heavy. She twisted her eyebrows and thought for a moment.She picked some from a pile of golden jewelry. It looked like it was very valuable, since it was wrapped in a rag.Recalling the picture of Zhao Nanyu delivering medicine to her just now, Song Luan\u2019s chest became stuffy, and felt suffocated.She didn\u2019t give up, nor did she believe that there was no medicine.She thought there would always be a way.She just wanted to escape from this place now.These gold and silver jewelry could be converted with a lot of money. With money, she could find a doctor by herself.Song Luan still remembered that the original owner had a lot of valuable jewelry in Huai Jin\u2019s small yard. She could go to Huai Jin, change the money, and run away.As for Zhao Nanyu, he would have no time to take care of her during this period of time. After the new year, the emperor would be very ill.The ruler of the capital would change. Sixth prince ascended the throne, and as his confidant, Zhao Nanyu would be busy at that time. He would have no energy and time to find her.She could understand Zhao Nanyu\u2019s perspective.The man in the original book was a paranoid psychopath in the later period. He took care of the female lead who he liked as his own property. He prepared everything by himself, and the woman never even got hurt.Therefore, Zhao Nanyu wanted to control her life and death. He wouldn\u2019t let her take little risks, or let her suffer in childbirth. It was completely in line with his personal settings.Song Luan understood him, but she couldn\u2019t help but blame him.She couldn\u2019t change the mind of a twisted person, so the only way was to run away.She wanted to stay away from Zhao Nanyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan knew that there were eyes around her that Zhao Nanyu planted. There may be more than one.She packed up the package in advance, which was full of gold and silver jewelry that could be exchanged for money. She only took a set of clothes.Zhao Nanyu undoubtedly knew her very well. In the past two days, there were several people who she had never seen before stood in front of the courtyard gate. They were big and fierce.Song Luan heard that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s cousin came to find her once, but was stopped outside by these men. As for herself, whenever she went out, she was followed by a tail that she couldn\u2019t throw off.When third lady Zhao came to talk to her as usual, she asked her curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with those people guarding the courtyard gate?\u201dThird lady Zhao thought in mind, that they looked like prison guards. Ah Yu, even if Song Luan\u2019s unborn child was important, wasn\u2019t this too much of a fuss? No one in the house was going to hurt her? Why be so careful.Song Luan pulled up the corner of her mouth and laughed sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just heard him say that the situation in the capital is not constant. It\u2019s safe for more people to guard this baby.\u201dThird lady Zhao didn\u2019t know anything about the affairs in the court. Third master Zhao was a fool again, she couldn\u2019t find out any news from him. She nodded, \u201cI see. I thought something was wrong.\u201dShe didn\u2019t plan to stay any more. Seeing that her face was okay, she was relieved. She got up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the old lady. Now that you\u2019re pregnant, you won\u2019t have to pay any monthly greetings.\u201dSong Luan nodded.Not long after third lady Zhao left, grandma Lin led little Zhao into the room.Little Zhao was wrapped up like a dumpling. As soon as he entered the house, he took off his cloak and patted the snow on it. His face was white and tender. He went to Song Luan and looked at her with dark eyes, \u201cMother.\u201dSong Luan touched the top of his head and said, \u201cLittle Zhao is here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He leaned on her carefully, while remembering that his mother was pregnant, so he did not dare to hold her tightly, nor dare to pounce on her arms.He opened his eyes and looked at Song Luan and asked, \u201cHow long will it take for my brother to come out?\u201dSong Luan held his hand in the air, then her eyes bent. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a brother? What if it\u2019s a sister? Wouldn\u2019t you like a sister?\u201dAfter thinking about it carefully, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll like it too.\u201dIn fact, he preferred the baby to be a brother, because he didn\u2019t like little girls very much. He had a girl cousin who kept on chattering. She seemed to have endless words to say to him every time. Although he had never said it, he still thought that his cousin was very annoying.Song Luan held his face and looked at him quietly. She didn\u2019t know what else to say for a moment. After a long silence, she hugged him in her arms and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cYou will always be your mother\u2019s darling.\u201dLittle Zhao was a bit uneasy, so he hugged her neck.***Song Luan didn\u2019t sleep well for two days. She easily wakes up, and only had shallow sleeps, because she constantly had bloody pictures in her mind.The snow on the eaves was melting.When Zhao Nanyu was about to go out in the morning, Song Luan was pale when she woke up.She slowly sat up from her bed, with her hair covered. She looked at the man\u2019s back and asked, \u201cWhen are you coming back today?\u201d\u201cIn the evening.\u201dOnce he comes back, she was afraid that tonight would be the day that she drinks the bowl of abortion medicine.As soon as Song Luan lowered her head, her eyes turned red, and she said in a hoarse voice, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll wait for you to come back.\u201dZhao Nanyu turned his head and leaned down on her brow, gently kissing her. His eyes was filled with pity, \u201cHmm.\u201dAfter he left, Song Luan couldn\u2019t sleep. She got out of bed and opened the closet. She took out the package that was hidden inside\u2013the locked box and the book.Song Luan\u2019s desire to leave him had never been so strong. The guard standing at the courtyard gate was just the beginning of his ruthlessness. In the future, Zhao Nanyu would become more severe, and his desire for control would be even more serious than now.Even as the plot moved forward, Zhao Nanyu was still the male lead of this book and the center of the world. His hegemony, his stubbornness and his indifference would not change.Grandma Lin didn\u2019t know what happened with them once she got the orders from Zhao Nanyu. Because of his orders, she never sewed clothes, shoes, and socks for children in front of her.When she was having lunch, she saw that Song Luan had eaten two bowls of rice, and her heart was finally at ease. \u201cIt\u2019s better for madam to think about it.\u201dSeeing that she had only eaten a little in these days, her thin figure became even more thin.Song Luan rarely smiled at her, \u201cToday, I have a good appetite.\u201dShe could only have the strength to climb over the wall when she\u2019s full.After lunch, Song Luan put the book in her sleeve.At first, she walked in the yard for two times, then went straight out. She looked at the man at the gate of the yard and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to the study. If you want to follow me, follow me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan looked at the guard who really followed her like an iceberg, and she became more angry.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t intend to run openly, she just wanted to put and leave the book in the study.Through a path and a door, she would arrive at the front yard. She could see Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study as soon as she turned the corner. There were people guarding outside his study, and most people wouldn\u2019t be able to get in.She was majestic, haughty, and was too famous for her reckless temperament by being easily provoked at first sight. Moreover, this beloved lady was now pregnant, and even if they wanted to stop her, they wouldn\u2019t dare to do it.The guard of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study gave way to her.Song Luan went into the study. After closing the door tightly, she took out the book in her sleeve and placed it squarely on his desk.Song Luan looked around in the study and found that there were several more paintings on the wall.The people in the paintings were all her.The skill of the painter was obviously excellent, and the painting was wonderful.Song Luan pretended that nothing happened and went back to the courtyard. The sky was getting dark. Soon after, Zhao Nanyu would be back from the palace.There were people watching inside and outside the yard. Only one place was safe\u2013the back wall that she had climbed once before.Song Luan changed into a light suit of clothes. As soon as there was no one around, she slipped under the back wall with a bit difficulty. It\u2019s amazing that there was a ladder in the corner.She had no time to think about it, so she changed the side of the ladder and climbed out of the yard flexibly.All of these things went smoothly and inconceivably. Song Luan was a little uneasy and her heart sank.***Zhao Nanyu was still on his way back to the house when his confidant brought news. \u201cMadam has gone out from the backyard, and her subordinates followed her secretly. They didn\u2019t lose her yet.\u201dZhao Nanyu closed his eyes and was not surprised. He seemed to have anticipated all this.\u201cTake care of her.\u201d\u201cBy the way, madam went to your study once today.\u201d\u201cI see. You go down.\u201d\u201cYes. \u201cZhao Nanyu opened his eyes, and there was a trace of violence in his eyes. Across the curtain, he said in a cold voice to the people outside, \u201cHurry up.\u201dThe coachman did not dare to delay and waved his whip.Zhao Nanyu got off the carriage and went straight to the study. He walked very fast, and arrived at the study that seemed to be rippling with a shallow fragrance.He went to the desk, two long fingers picked up the book she had left. The red paper and black characters made his eyes ache.The thin paper gradually twisted in his hands. Zhao Nanyu looked at it word by word. His face gradually turned white. There was a melancholy air between his eyebrows. He took great efforts to restrain his irritability to kill people.On the edge of the book was a jade pendant that he personally made her wore around her neck.Shaking his hands, he put the two things in the drawer. With a sneer, he pushed open the door and asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d***Thanks to Song Luan\u2019s good memory, she still remembered where Huai Jin lives. She didn\u2019t dare to run very fast with her baby in her stomach.It\u2019s getting dark.Counting the time, Zhao Nanyu should have gone back to her house. If he was faster, he would have seen what she left behind on his desk.The street was quiet and empty. Her heart suddenly jumped, and she was still a little afraid.She was trembling all the way.She was about to arrive at the end of the street, when suddenly, a group of people appeared at the end.Zhao Nanyu was dressed in black, his face half hidden in the dark. He sat high on his horse\u2019s back, and his eyebrows seemed to be covered with a thin layer of frost and snow.Song Luan\u2019s legs became soft when she saw him, and she fell to the ground.Zhao Nanyu got off the horse, stepped on his boots, and approached her step by step. He squatted down, raised her chin, and looked at her. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201dEven if you run, how can you still run to your old friend\u2019s house.Song Luan suddenly shed tears, silently crying. She hiccuped, and didn\u2019t know whether she was scared by Zhao Nanyu\u2019s appearance.Most of the time, her tears didn\u2019t work for him. He picked her up, and patted her on the back, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u201dAs soon as she got up, all the gold and silver jewelry that Song Luan had been holding fell out. Zhao Nanyu picked up one of the gold ingots and looked at it. He raised his lips and laughed. There was a little irony in his smile. \u201cDo you want to change these for money?\u201dHe pointed to the inscription under the gold ingot, as he touched her face, and kindly said, \u201cSee? These are all gifts by the Emperor, no one would dare to accept them.\u201dZhao Nanyu pretended to sigh, \u201cWell, even if you run out like this, what can you do?\u201dNo money, no friends.He started cutting her wings a long time ago.Song Luan\u2019s scalp felt numb and frightened. She looked at him in disbelief, \u201cYou \u2026 you you..\u201dZhao Nanyu took a fierce bite on her lip, then took her back to the residence.T/N: This was so intense\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan was properly placed in the room. She curled up, buried her face between her legs, her body trembling slightly.Soon after, Zhao Nanyu opened the door and walked to her with the medicine. His tall body covered the light in front of her. Song Luan raised her face, her eyes were flushed, and she pitifully tugged his sleeves, shaking. \u201cCan you think of a way? I can\u2019t. I really can\u2019t.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t kill her own child by herself.Zhao Nanyu felt uncomfortable, and was numb after being hit by the truth. \u201cDo you remember that you were poisoned before?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe poisoned her.\u201cThe remaining poison is unclear. Even if you and your child are safe in the future, he will not live long, or he will be born disabled.\u201dSong Luan whispered, her nails pierced her palms, but she could not feel the pain.So this was it ah.It turned out that no matter how hard she tried, it was useless.Zhao Nanyu hugged her and fed the medicine into her mouth little by little. She obediently drank the whole bowl of medicine, pouring the bitter medicine through her throat into her abdomen.Before long, there was no blood on Song Luan\u2019s face, her lips were pale, and bursts of pain surged, as if someone was holding a knife while stirring her lower abdomen. It was so painful that she could not speak.Her bottom skirt was stained red with blood, and the smell of blood in the room became stronger.Crystal tears flowed uncontrollably from the corners of her eyes. Zhao Nanyu hugged her, his heart twisted and he said in a hoarse voice, \u201cYou\u2019ll be better soon, Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dSong Luan raised her neck and eyelids laboriously.She originally wanted to say \u201cI hate you\u201d, but after thinking about it, the decision he made was reasonable.\u201cIt\u2019s so painful. It hurts, Zhao Nanyu.\u201dHe wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes, and said to her ears over and over again. \u201cI am here. I am here.\u201dThe blood was constantly flowing, which shocked Zhao Nanyu. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will be well soon.\u201dThe extreme pain made her delirious. Why did this happen to her? Did she do something wrong?She blinked at Zhao Nanyu, angrily, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me, I still have to go.\u201d\u201cYou also saw what the book I left for you?\u201d She laughed lowly. \u201cI said before that I like you, but that was all just a lie.\u201dSong Luan was suffocated for too long. She was bound by the plot of the male lead, and the severe pain in her lower abdomen made her feel that she was about to die.She simply said everything she wanted to say at once, \u201cI don\u2019t like you, no one will be better for you.\u201dHuai Jin and He Run were much better than him.She couldn\u2019t shake the line of fate of the original owner.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you. My father is a high official and my brother spoils me. After I get better, I will leave you without looking back.\u201d Her voice became lower and she gritted her teeth, \u201cI just want to find a good man.\u201dSong Luan looked at the painful expression on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face.After venting, the pain in the lower abdomen gradually improved.She was sweating profusely, and she was lying in the arms of Zhao Nanyu with a pale face. She did not resist the intense pain. Song Luan closed her eyes and fell asleep.The blood under her body finally stopped. Zhao Nanyu washed her and put on a set of clean clothes for her.His brain swelled and his eyes tightened. With every breath, his throat and heart seemed to be cut open by a knife, and he couldn\u2019t stand upright in pain.The faint yellow candle illuminated her beautiful face. Zhao Nanyu looked at her face obsessively. He suddenly remembered the words written on the book she gave him, and remembered who she wanted to find today. Every word she said poked his heart.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were deep and bottomless, and his cold palms covered her ankles.He whispered in her ear, \u201cMhm, you\u2019re mine.\u201d***Song Luan slept in bed unconsciously for three or four days while being fed with water every day.She still somehow remembered the deep hoarse voice in her ears whenever she was half-awake.When she opened her eyes, it was already the second day of the new year. Because it was snowing heavily outside, the windows and the doors were tightly closed. Song Luan sat up from the bed, her face pale as paper, and her slender fingers squeezed the sheets under her. Her eyelashes trembled as she raised her eyelids to look around.There was no one in the room.There was no discomfort except for having no strength and stamina.She moved her legs and heard a series of Jingling bells. Song Luan lifted the quilt and looked at the silver chain on her ankles.She was stunned for a second before she laughed.See, all her guesses and worries were coming true.The male lead is a sick dog.The door was opened with a squeak. A man in a dark suit came in, and the wind that came from the opening of the door dissipated some of the room\u2019s heat.Song Luan\u2019s blank eyes suddenly became clear. She tried to pull the chain around her feet.Her face was ugly, and her tone was rather harsh, \u201cUntie it.\u201dZhao Nanyu sat down beside her in silence, gently stroked her face, and smiled weakly, \u201cYou finally woke up.\u201dHis eyes were also haggard, and his lips were pale. It seemed that his life was not easy when she was in bed for two days.The unborn child was also Zhao Nanyu\u2019s flesh and blood. He once sincerely looked forward to this baby\u2019s coming.The poison was caused by himself. The child was killed by himself.His heart was not made of stone, how could it not hurt? The tip of his heart felt like it was in a thorn-like barb. If he wanted to take it out, it would hurt more.Holding a bowl of porridge, Zhao Nanyu continued, \u201cEat something first.\u201dAlthough Song Luan had no strength, she looked up at him with her chin up, \u201cYou untie it.\u201dSince Zhao Nanyu acted like he had not heard it, Song Luan lowered her head and bit him fiercely on his wrist. Her sharp teeth deeply pierced his flesh skin, and blood started to trickle down.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to feel pain, because his eyebrows didn\u2019t even wrinkle.Song Luan was a little frustrated. She seemed to understand the reason why Zhao Nanyu was so cautious. In fact, she was so delirious now that she couldn\u2019t remember everything he had said.She smiled weakly and looked at Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes very calmly. No could even find any resentment against him in her eyes. \u201cWhat I said that day was nonsense. You can untie it. I won\u2019t run.\u201dSong Luan took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m like this now. What do you want to do?\u201dHer words were like a sharp sword, which pierced directly to his heart.Song Luan reminded Zhao Nanyu from time to time that it was he who harmed her.Song Luan wanted him to understand that she wouldn\u2019t sneak away in the future. Nothing good would come out from it.Wasn\u2019t she still married to him?The blood color on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face gradually faded. He lowered his eyes, took out key, and untied her shackles without saying a word.Song Luan didn\u2019t look at him. She laid down again, with her back to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat.\u201dZhao Nanyu thought that she would wake up crying and yelling at his nose, but she was calm as if nothing had happened, and he couldn\u2019t see any resentment in her eyes against him.She had no feelings for him.Zhao Nanyu forced a smile in his pale face. \u201cHow would you eat these days? Don\u2019t harm your body.\u201dSong Luan turned around, looked at him straight in the eyes, and mockingly smiled, \u201cIf you go out, I\u2019ll eat.\u201dZhao Nanyu humbly replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dAs soon as he left, grandma Lin came in with her lunch. She waited carefully as she watched her eat two bowls of porridge before taking off the table.Song Luan put on a coat and got out of bed. The house was full of charcoal and fire, and she didn\u2019t feel cold at all. Song Luan wanted to open the window to let in air, but she was stopped by grandma Lin, \u201cMadam, it\u2019s cold outside. It will harm your body.\u201dShe nodded, the body was her own, but she couldn\u2019t let other people worry about her health\u2026Zhao Nanyu also knew that Song Luan didn\u2019t want to see him. She still stayed and ate in her room three meals a day.After a few days, seeing her face gradually become more and more rosy, Zhao Nanyu said, \u201cThe Lantern Festival is coming soon. The street will be very busy that night, and you will certainly like it. \u201cSong Luan showed a lack of interest, \u201cOh.\u201dWhen she woke up, she found that his jade pendant was perfectly worn on her neck. Song Luan was indifferent to this, because whatever she does, she couldn\u2019t defeat Zhao Nanyu.He held her from his back and gently put his hands on her waist. Zhao Nanyu put his chin on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s body turned stiff, her eyes didn\u2019t know where to look, \u201cI\u2019m wondering if the baby is a boy or a girl?\u201dShe and Zhao Nanyu are not bad in terms of looks. If it was a girl, she must be very lovely. If it was a boy, he should be as smart as little Zhao.Zhao Nanyu choked and couldn\u2019t speak. When he recovered, he was about to open his mouth, when he heard Song Luan say, \u201cWell\u2026well, we won\u2019t talk about this.\u201dIt\u2019s just a two-way street.***The news of Song Luan\u2019s miscarriage was known to everyone in the house, just like when she got pregnant.Third lady Zhao almost fainted when she heard the news. The last time when she went back to see her, wasn\u2019t she and her baby doing okay? How could the child disappear in a twinkling of an eye? Ah Yu was so strict again. It shouldn\u2019t be.She wanted to visit, but Ah Yu refused her.Third lady Zhao saw that he was also haggard.For more than ten years that she lived with him, Ah Yu\u2019s being depressed was really rare. She patted him on the shoulder, and could only comfort him by saying, \u201cYou are still young. There will be children in the future. Don\u2019t be too sad.\u201dZhao Nanyu gently pulled the corners of his mouth, but couldn\u2019t laugh.No, not in my life.\u201cWhen Ah Luan is better, I hope mother can talk with her.\u201d Zhao Nanyu said in a low voice.Third lady Zhao felt that her stepson was rather pitiful, so she nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThank you, mother.\u201d***This year, Song Luan lived a quiet life.On the third day of the new year\u2019s day, the old lady asked her to have dinner with her. Song Luan cleaned herself up very beautiful and put on her makeup to suppress her pale face.Compared with the few days ago, she was much thinner, and her clothes all looked big on her body.She didn\u2019t know if the old lady pitied her, but this time, her eyes softened a lot, and she didn\u2019t say anything weird.Both the first lady Zhao and the second lady Zhao were talking happily. Song Luan only drank chicken soup, and didn\u2019t intend to get into their topic, but they always wanted to mention her.The second lady pretended to ask, \u201cIs Ah Luan in good health? This miscarriage is not a trivial matter. If it was not taken care well, it might grow to a serious disease in the future.\u201dSong Luan placed down the spoon in her hand and laughed at the second lady, as she said bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m good. Don\u2019t be disappointed.\u201dThe second lady\u2019s face changed and she gave her a look. \u201cWhy do you talk like that? Your aunt cares about you.\u201dCare? Song Luan just wanted to sneer.Even the old lady didn\u2019t make fun with her miscarriage, but this second lady had a mouth in her ear.\u201cThen, I\u2019m bothering you.\u201dThe old lady interrupted them coldly, \u201cEnough. Let\u2019s eat our meal.\u201dAfter the meal, the second wife still didn\u2019t intend to stop. Her voice was so loud that she didn\u2019t know who she was talking to, \u201cMy son has three children. He is younger than Ah Yu. In the past two days, I heard that one of his concubines was pregnant again. He also had a good wife. She was generous, good-natured and obedient.\u201dWhen the two wives, and others around them sighed, they didn\u2019t forget to glance at Song Luan. \u201cIf a man marries a wife, she should be a virtuous person. If the wife is not good-natured, the husband can\u2019t take it.\u201dThe first lady glanced at her secretly and said with profound meaning, \u201cI remember that Ah Yu never had a concubine?\u201dWho didn\u2019t have a concubine room in this world? If a man takes a good concubine, he must take her in a sedan chair.The first lady didn\u2019t want to get involved in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s affairs. Whether he accepts a concubine or not had nothing to do with her.Now that her eldest son had returned to the capital, Song Luan was shamelessly seducing her eldest son. Although she had not intensified her strength, her nature had not changed. What if she wanted to hook up with her son again?With Song Luan\u2019s beauty, it was not impossible for her eldest son to be confused. Therefore, the eldest lady wanted to use the opportunity to coax the old lady to give Zhao Nanyu a concubine and give Song Luan a stumbling block, so that she had no energy to hook up with others.The truth was, Song Luan couldn\u2019t wait for Zhao Nanyu to take a concubine. Who could stand him?She said with a smile, \u201cThis wife is not jealous. I\u2019m weak and often can\u2019t serve my husband well. I also want to find two young girls to serve him.\u201dThe old lady coughed twice. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about this.\u201dSong Luan understood that the old lady had a plan in mind.Before leaving, the old lady asked her servant to bring her a box of first-class ginseng from the house. After all, it was her wish. Song Luan didn\u2019t refuse, and she took the things and said thanks in a low voice.When Zhao Nanyu returned home late at night, Song Luan was still awake. She sat barefoot on the bed, while holding her chin, as she told him about today\u2019s affairs like it was a joke. \u201cLord Zhao [m] respectful but rather distant tone to address Zhao Nanyu [/m] has a lot of good fortune. Grandmother is planning to take two concubines just for you.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to hear what she said. He quietly put on her socks for her and placed them back in the quilt. \u201cDon\u2019t get cold.\u201dSong Luan, as opposed to him, kicked off the quilt with a smile in her eyes. \u201cAre you not moved when you hear about the many beauties?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were fixed on her face. He wanted to find a trace of jealousy and unwillingness in her eyes, but there was no such thing. Her eyes were as clean as a spring water, clear, and smooth. It seems that she just really wanted to tell him the news.\u201cIt has nothing to do with me.\u201dSong Luan exclaimed, \u201cYou are really heartless.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked pale while curling up his fingers. He couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me much.\u201dSong Luan blinked at him, \u201cI care.\u201dA liar.In fact, her acting skills were very poor. Maybe she didn\u2019t even want to hide it from him.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes darkened, and was hurt by her strike.His breath seemed to have a bloody smell, and his throat was extremely hoarse. \u201cOkay, sleep.\u201dSong Luan was lying in the innermost part of the bed with a quilt rolled up. The paper lamp on the head of the bed illuminating a dim light.She said, \u201cLet\u2019s go out and have a look on the day of the Lantern Festival.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s heart trembled, and he put out the light, and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go with my brother together.\u201dShe just wanted to see Song Heqing, since she was kept in the house. She didn\u2019t know when she could go out again, since she had seen Zhao Nanyu crazy appearance once. Tying her foot and wrist with chain was really not good. She didn\u2019t want to experience it again.Wasn\u2019t he fond of good and flowery words? Then she would grant it.She said thousand times ten thousand words, all of them were fake. Because of her clumsy acting skills, she didn\u2019t believe that Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t see it\u2019s a lie. If he was willing to fool himself, she didn\u2019t care.With more than ten days to go before the Lantern Festival, Song Luan was not interested in his affairs. During the day, she slept more than she wakes up.The day before the Lantern Festival, she saw the gold and silver jewelry in the cabinet, and was stunned for a moment. She remembered what Zhao Nanyu had said, and his expression at that time to her.She carefully threw all the things picked out from Zhao Nanyu\u2019s storeroom to the other side. After throwing them, there was not much left in the box.When Zhao Nanyu came back, he saw that she had thrown all those things away without saying anything. She was wearing thin clothes, and was standing by the window to get some air. He wrapped his cloak around her tightly. \u201cBe careful of the cold wind.\u201dSong Luan was locked in his arms, and could smell his scent, \u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be cold.\u201dSong Luan shut up immediately.He bought her some snacks that she liked to eat. Song Luan didn\u2019t touch it, only giving a glance before ignoring it completely. He turned around and ordered people to throw it away.Zhao Nanyu looked dimly in the corner, his face becoming tensed, and said nothing.In the evening, Song Luan tossed and turned in the bed. She was not yet sleepy.Zhao Nanyu held her in his arms, kissed her lips, and hummed softly.Song Luan closed her eyes while laying in his arms, and fell asleep faintly.This lullaby was often sung by his mother when he was a child.Zhao Nanyu looked down at the woman in his arms and held her tighter.T/N: My heart ached for ZN\u2026but SL had it hard..she was forced to abort her child.. *sighs*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I also would like to apologize for the previous chapters. I wasn\u2019t able to include an ending paragraph that was supposed to be in chapter 61. I included it in the beginning of chapter 62 (thanks to matryoshka~).Translated by: TinkerSong Luan\u2019s sleeping habit seemed to have improved. The next day when she woke up, she found that her whole body was wrapped around him.Zhao Nanyu was still not awake, so she gently took back her legs and feet, slowly retreating from his arms.Song Luan\u2019s eyes focused on the man in front of her. The corner of his eyes had a tint of blue and black, as if he hadn\u2019t had a good sleep for a long time. She stretched out her fingers and stroke his eyebrows and eyes, and it gradually fell on his thin lips.His eyelashes are long and curly, his nose, eyes and mouth are delicate. His face is a kind of morbid white.His collar was slightly open and his collarbone was visibly seen.It was still dark outside the window, and only a faint light could be seen in the distance.Song Luan was just about to take her hand back, when the man suddenly opened his eyes and held her fingers. His dim eyes gradually became clear, and his deep and magnetic voice flowed into her ears. \u201cWhy did you wake up so early? Did you have a nightmare?\u201dSong Luan took her fingers back, looked at him, and shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201dZhao Nanyu got up. Even though the room was dark, he didn\u2019t put on the light. After putting on his clothes, he turned to her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s still early. You can sleep more.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes did not move away from him. He was a lot thinner than before, and his long clothes looked a little empty on his body. Looking at his back, she suddenly said, \u201cAre you going to the court?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d Zhao Nanyu explained to her in a low voice, \u201cBut I\u2019ll be back soon after I go out to work.\u201dSong Luan got up slowly from the bed. She licked her mouth and explained to Zhao Nanyu, \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I\u2019ll get up and have breakfast before I go to sleep. \u201cZhao Nanyu pressed her shoulder. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell the maidservants to prepare breakfast.\u201dSong Luan looked down, and her long black hair covered half of her face. He couldn\u2019t see the expression on her face.By the time she got dressed and washed, the sun was already shining.Zhao Nanyu filled a bowl of millet porridge for her and pushed it to her, \u201cHave a taste.\u201dSong Luan took a sip and almost threw out the food. Her eyebrows wrinkled tightly, as she said, \u201cIt tastes so bad.\u201dIt\u2019s very salty and had a burnt smell.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes darkened and took the millet porridge in her hand to his side, \u201cThen don\u2019t eat this.\u201dGrandma Lin coughed twice, but she couldn\u2019t say anything when the young master was here. The young master personally went to the kitchen this morning. She didn\u2019t know if it was on a whim.His first time cooking porridge was not good.Naturally, Song Luan didn\u2019t know about it.Zhao Nanyu had no appetite these days. Seeing that he had eaten only a little bit, she placed down her chopsticks.Song Luan was supposed to pretend that she didn\u2019t see anything. However, she was too soft hearted, and couldn\u2019t resist saying, \u201cEat more.\u201dHis body was becoming thinner. It looked so unfamiliar and strange that it made her distressed.After Zhao Nanyu heard her, he ate an extra bowl of rice.***Later, old lady Zhao sent two maidservants who were close to her. The two girls were very young, around 15 or 16 years old, a perfect age to marry.It was said that the maidservants belittled their identity. They were beautiful as flowers, and had a good figure. They all showed their perfect demeanor with a smile.The old lady knew her grandson. Zhao Nanyu looked good in talking, but he didn\u2019t acutally obey the discipline. If she took two concubines directly for him, he would not accept it. He wouldn\u2019t even touch those concubines, and would send them back to her fully intact.So the old lady planned to take these girls as Song Luan\u2019s maidservants. Song Luan was also fragile, delicate, and sickly, while Zhao Nanyu was very energetic. How could she bear it?After seeing the beautiful maidservants around Song Luan as time goes by, he wouldn\u2019t help but yearn for them.The two maids, Chunyu and Donghui, were named by the old lady herself. They were brought up as maids in Zhao\u2019s family since childhood. They were knowledgeable, reasonable, clever, and sensible. The most important thing was that they had a clean family background, and they treat people wholeheartedly.Obedient girls were those who please their elders. Song Luan\u2019s persistence to disobey and contradict elders irritated people around her.Song Luan held her head, and looked at the graceful Chunyu and Donghui on her spare time. This made the two girls upset.When they served in the old lady\u2019s yard, they had heard of the young lady\u2019s prestige, and that she often quarreled with the old lady. Therefore, even if the young master was bright and good-looking, they wouldn\u2019t dare to rejoice in their hearts, for fear that they would be caught and scolded by the young lady.In the past six months, they saw that Song Luan\u2019s temper had restrained, so they dared to come by her side and serve her.Young master, that was as gentle as the clear wind and shining moon, had an excellent appearance. No one would not be moved. If their body could be given to this young master, what was it to take some risks?Song Luan coughed twice and said in a cold voice, \u201cSince you have chosen to serve me, you will abide by my rules from now on.\u201dThey nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t want to talk to them anymore, so she waved her hand and said, \u201cOkay, you go out first.\u201dWhen they left the room, grandma Lin came up to remind her, \u201cMadam, you better guard against them. I see that they did not come with good motives.\u201dAlthough they were not as beautiful as Song Luan, they were far better than ordinary girls.The old lady\u2019s mind was clear, even if it was to open branches and leaves as soon as possible through a concubines room. Grandma Lin felt that the old lady was determined because she was dissatisfied with Song Luan. She wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to fill the young master\u2019s room.She shook her head. Others could not see clearly, but she could see that the young master\u2019s feelings for Song Luan was very deep. When she slept for a few days, he couldn\u2019t help but guard by her bedside.While Song Luan was unconscious, the young master had sung a soft tune in her ear, while gently wiping her body with medicine. The young master never borrowed other people\u2019s hands to watch over Song Luan.Song Luan laughed, \u201cI know.\u201dThen she looked at grandma Lin and asked curiously, \u201cIs Zhao Nanyu really so popular?\u201dWhy do little girls like to come up to him? even Song Yu wanted to die for him.Grandma Lin hesitated and didn\u2019t know how to reply.In those days, if the young master didn\u2019t marry her, he would still not have to worry about his marriage. Many of the nobles in the Marquis came to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s residence. They didn\u2019t despised his origin.\u201cThe young master is good-looking and good-natured, so naturally he will be liked.\u201dSong Luan did not agree with this. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s temper is not good! He had extreme jealousy, hatred, and anger.But thinking about it carefully, he treated her well on so many days, but his extreme paranoia made her afraid.\u201cI see.\u201dIndeed, in this world, Song Luan had never seen a man as better looking as Zhao Nanyu. His facial features seemed to have been carefully carved\u2013delicate and elegant, and his temperament was excellent.For most of the month, it snowed in the capital. Little Zhao hadn\u2019t seen Song Luan for many days. Only after her body was better, could the child be allowed to visit her mother.After the year passed, little Zhao was already five years old.During this period of time, Song Luan\u2019s body was taken care of by third lady Zhao.The little kid was forced to put on red coat that he didn\u2019t like very much. He was tender and white, but his face was serious.She was very joyful to see little Zhao in red. Song Luan chuckled and pinched his face. \u201cLittle Zhao is really brilliant.\u201dIn this world, only she and Zhao Nanyu had the honor to pinch little Zhao\u2019s cheek. Other people could not carelessly touch.Little Zhao also knew that his younger brother or sister was gone. His father said that he was not allowed to mention it in front of his mother. He closed his mouth and did not even ask.He opened his hand, and there was a pink camellia. \u201cHere you are, mother.\u201dHe picked it specially for his mother.Song Luan took the flower and praised him happily, \u201cOh, how beautiful. I like it very much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you some more next time.\u201dShe was moved and amused. Song Luan touched his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to pick it. The flowers won\u2019t live long after you pick it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Little Zhao was really obedient. Since his mother said so, then he would naturally follow. After a bit of silence, he added in a low voice, \u201cThen I won\u2019t pick any more.\u201dSuch beautiful flowers should live long.This time, little Zhao suddenly talked more in front of her. He stayed obediently in her arms and slowly said, \u201cI saw my uncle during the New Year.\u201dOn the first day of the new year, he went to the Song family to pay New Year\u2019s greetings and met his grandmother and uncle.He stayed for three or four days.Little Zhao used to hate going to the Song family. No one talked to him or played with him, and his mother would keep him in the house.Since his mother didn\u2019t shut him down, he felt that his uncle and grandmother also liked him very much.\u201cIs it? Is it fun there?\u201d Song Luan asked him.He thought about it and nodded, \u201cMm-hmm.\u201dAlthough he liked to be quiet and alone, but the children over there were willing to talk to him.Song Luan suddenly had some regrets. She didn\u2019t return to her mother\u2019s home during the Spring Festival. Aunt Lin must have missed her very much, and probably hated Zhao Nanyu more.Aunt Lin had been dissatisfied with Zhao Nanyu. This time she had a miscarriage, which was enough for Aunt Lin to gnash her teeth with hatred, and wanted to tear him to pieces.Song Luan knew that Zhao Nanyu was guilty. Since he didn\u2019t do it on purpose, her resentment seemed so unreasonable.However, Song Luan was really afraid of that kind of intense and long pain. The pain in her body was tolerable, but her heart now felt painful and uncomfortable.She tried very hard not to blame him.Little Zhao looked up at his mother, and suddenly fell silent. His little hand gently tugged at the corner of her dress.He took out a red and white envelope from her pocket and put it in her hand as if he was flattering her, \u201cMother, this is the red envelope given to me by my uncle and grandmother.\u201d\u201cThen you keep it.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dHe wanted to give all his good things to his mother.Song Luan couldn\u2019t laugh or cry. Although she liked money, she was also embarrassed to take her baby\u2019s lucky money.She said, \u201cYou can keep it yourself. By the way, your mother hasn\u2019t given you a red envelope yet! Wait, your mother will give you a big red envelope tonight, okay?\u201dLittle Zhao thought that gold and silver were not important to him, and he could not use it. Seeing his mother liked it, he wanted to give them to her.He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. My uncle and grandmother gave me a lot of things.\u201dSong Luan knew her mother and brother, and she always put gold in her hand every time they met. They were very generous.Little Zhao stubbornly put all the money he received into her hand, and looked at her expectantly with a pair of big eyes, afraid that she would not want it.Song Luan finally compromised and locked his lucky money in a small drawer. She said with a smile, \u201cWhen you grow up, this money will be used to marry your wife!\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t know if it was enough.Little Zhao was too young to understand the words of marrying a wife, so he just nodded stupidly, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan flicked his forehead and was amused by the child\u2019s rare stupidity.Although little Zhao said he would not ask for her red envelope, Song Luan still wanted to prepare one for him that night. As a mother, she couldn\u2019t do nothing to prepare her children during the Spring Festival.She called grandma Lin into the room and asked, \u201cIs there anything little Zhao like in his daily life?\u201dGrandma Lin took care of little Zhao since he was born. She knew his hobby better than Song Luan.She replied, \u201cIt seems that he doesn\u2019t like anything, other than reading books.\u201dSong Luan was a little embarrassed and asked, \u201cIf I give him a chessboard, do you think he will like it?\u201dGrandma Lin replied truthfully, \u201cAs long as it is given by madam, he will like it.\u201dSong Luan frowned and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll think about it again.\u201dAfter thinking about it for a long time, Song Luan had an idea. Little Zhao would go to school after the new year. Although she was not good at sewing, she could still sew a small schoolbag.Song Luan immediately told grandma Lin to prepare the needle and thread. She buried herself in sewing the whole afternoon before barely making a decent little schoolbag.In the evening, Zhao Nanyu asked the servants to send a message that he would return late.Song Luan didn\u2019t wait for him, and had dinner with little Zhao. Before long, grandma Lin brought in the medicine she used to drink.Song Luan was used to the bitter taste of the medicine, so she could directly drink it without frowning. As Song Luan turned around, she saw little Zhao with red eyes, and an aggrieved face while looking at her.She was surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHe wiped the water out of the corner of his eyes and said in a stuffy voice, \u201cI\u2019m okay, mother.\u201dHe just remembered the basin of blood coming out of his mother\u2019s residence that day. The smell of medicine reminded him of the scene.Song Luan knew that he was distressed, so she took out the small schoolbag she made in the afternoon, and handed it to little Zhao together with a red envelope. \u201cHave a look, do you like it?!\u201dHe squeezed the strap of his schoolbag. It was just right. His books could fit into this bag. he wanted to use in school.His appearance gradually changed, and he laughed again, as he nodded heavily, \u201cYes.\u201dWhen Song Luan saw him happy, she was in a better mood.Well, her baby was still her sweetheart!Song Luan whispered to little Zhao, coaxing him to sleep.Zhao Nanyu still did not return, so grandma Lin asked her whether to wait for him to come back?She shook her head. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t wait.\u201dGrandma Lin retreated from the room. Song Luan put out the paper lamp and closed her eyes. After half a column of incense, she was still awake. After a long time, Song Luan heard something coming from the door.Zhao Nanyu, wrapped in cold air, pushed the door open. Someone carried hot water for him from outside. The girl pinched her voice and whispered, \u201cYoung master, I will wait for you to change your clothes, so you can go and take a bath.\u201dThis was the voice of Donghui.Song Luan sat up from the bed, her eyebrows lifted, these two young animals that old lady Zhao sent really worked fast! On the first day that Zhao Nanyu arrived, they hurriedly came to his side.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was like frost, and his voice was as cold as a thousand years ice. \u201cRoll.\u201dDonghui bit her lip, but she didn\u2019t give up. She didn\u2019t want to give up such a good chance, although it\u2019s very rare for young master to speak loudly, and also for him to say roll to people.She was red eyed and looked like a willow. \u201cLet me serve you.\u201dZhao Nanyu, white and frightening, glanced coldly and said angrily, \u201cGrandma Lin, take her out from me. Those who do not obey the rules of the master will be killed directly.\u201dGrandma Lin\u2019s heart leaped suddenly, but she didn\u2019t expect that Zhao Nanyu would be so ruthless on the first day. He even wanted to kill her directly.Donghui was so scared that she knelt down and begged for mercy. \u201cForgive me, master.\u201dZhao Nanyu waved his hand, \u201cTake her out.\u201dHer life was spared. She was not killed.Song Luan eyebrow gradually unfolded as she listened. Since she couldn\u2019t sleep, she put on her shoes, and got out. She wanted to spectate this joke.Zhao Nanyu was already sitting in the bath bucket behind the screen. His clothes were hanging high on it. Song Luan twisted her eyebrows. She did not know if it was her own illusion, but she could smell the scent of blood.As soon as she reached the screen, the man inside said sharply, \u201cGet out.\u201dSong Luan raised her eyebrows and poked out her head. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll roll.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t expect it would be her. So late, he thought she would have gone to bed. As soon as he returned to the yard, grandma Lin told him that Song Luan didn\u2019t wait for him, and went to bed on her own.Zhao Nanyu was stunned for a moment, and explained in an unnatural tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s you.\u201dHow could he be willing to let her go?Song Luan was about to leave, but she was grabbed by her wrist behind her back. She fell into the bath tub in confusion, and the warm water wet her cheek.She wiped the water in front of her eyes and opened her mouth to speak, but was frightened by the shocking scar on his chest.Zhao Nanyu was injured. It seemed that he was stabbed by someone.Song Luan moved her lips and said, \u201cYou\u2026are you okay?\u201dZhao Nanyu put the palm of her hand on the wound on his chest and pressed it hard. \u201cIt\u2019s a little painful.\u201dIt would be strange that such a cruel self-mutilation wouldn\u2019t hurt!Song Luan gave him an angry look, and tried to climb out of the tub.However, even though he was hurt, he still had great strength. He immediately took her back to his arms, leaned wearily against her, and whispered, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sleep? Are you waiting for me?\u201dAfter a little silence, Zhao Nanyu gently stroke her back and said, \u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t sleep these days. All of his dreams were pictures of her covered in blood. He couldn\u2019t make a noise in his dreams every time.Song Luan didn\u2019t say anything or resist, so he hugged her tighter.He coughed twice, and whispered hoarsely, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll sing you a lullaby later.\u201dT/N: ZN has the habit of singing lullabies to Song Luan. Maybe it\u2019s because Song Luan always had nightmares?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Song Luan\u2019s wet clothes clung to her body, and her hand was forced to press on his wound.Her palms were now stained with his blood.She got up from the bath tub, wiped the blood on her hands with a cloth, and sniffed it, but she could still smell the metallic taste.As soon as she changed her clean clothes, Zhao Nanyu came out with a bare chest.To stop the blood from flowing out his wound, he got the medicine from the cabinet, sprinkled it on his bloody wound, and took a breath of pain. Song Luan pretended not to hear his gasp, she only stopped for a moment, dried her hair, and crawled back to bed.Song Luan didn\u2019t know how he got the injury. He was a handsome scholar that didn\u2019t need to dance with knives and swords.She had no intentions asking Zhao Nanyu. She was not interested in his affairs.Most of Song Luan\u2019s face was hidden under the quilt. Even if she tried to closed her eyes, she still couldn\u2019t sleep.After Zhao Nanyu wrapped his wounds with bandage, he laid on her side. The light fragrance of Song Luan filled the tip of his nose, and he put his arm around her waist. He took the woman into his arms, and hummed softly.Song Luan didn\u2019t know where he learned the tune, but it was really nice and calming.Zhao Nanyu slept but got woken up in the middle of the night by Song Luan\u2019s nightmares.She unconsciously grabbed him by the corner of his clothes. Her petite body that curled up, went straight into his arms, and her tears were almost on the corner of her eyes.Her consciousness was not clear. She was in a daze, as she choked and said, \u201cIt\u2019s painful. It really hurts\u2026\u201dAll her bones felt cold, and everything inside her body couldn\u2019t breathe.The cramps in her lower abdomen felt like it was being pricked by people one by one.Her dream only reflected the vast expanse of dark red colors. The whole world seems to be pasted with blood.Hearing her voice, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face suddenly turned pale. He couldn\u2019t make a noise. He could only hold her tightly while he murmured in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. It doesn\u2019t hurt, it won\u2019t hurt any more.\u201dSong Luan obviously couldn\u2019t remember what he said last night. She stretched out and got up from the bed. The sunshine was just right, and the winter sun was a little dazzling.Song Luan found that the two beauties sent by the old lady yesterday were missing. She asked grandma Lin casually, \u201cWhat about the two girls?\u201dGrandma Lin replied, \u201cDonghui is not sensible. She bumped into young master last night and was disposed of. As for the other one, she was sent back to the old lady by the young master.\u201dDonghui was beaten by a board before being sent out of the house. The young master\u2019s ruthless methods made people cover their mouth. The person being beaten couldn\u2019t make a sound. Her blood was blurred and it made everyone who witnessed it feel frightened.It\u2019s more about killing a chicken to scare a monkey.Last night, the young master asked the servants to wash the blood on the ground, for fear that it might scare his wife.None of the servants mentioned this to her.Song Luan was indifferent, but she sighed in a pitiful tone, \u201cI think those two girls are quite beautiful.\u201dThey were just too anxious, and didn\u2019t find the right time.\u201cNot half as beautiful as Madam.\u201d Grandma Lin said.Song Luan looked at the face reflected in the mirror. This face, which looked exactly like her face before she transmigrated, was still beautiful and moving, although it lacked some vitality.She touched her cheek in a trance. She wondered if she had a chance to go back?Little Zhao got up late. He then put on his clothes and came out of the house.After Zhao Nanyu came back last night, he had already fallen asleep. He did not see his father, and he was dejected.He consciously climbed up on Song Luan\u2019s legs, looked up at her, and asked, \u201cMother, where is father?\u201dSong Luan was embarrassed and said, \u201cMother doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen father for many days.\u201dA few days before the new year, he was at his grandfather\u2019s house. After he was sent home, his father had to take care of his unconscious mother.He was too busy to see him.Listening to the children\u2019s complaints, Song Luan did not know what to say.\u201cWell, maybe he\u2019ll be back in the evening.\u201d She said, \u201cthen you will see him.\u201dBecause little Zhao felt sad, Song Luan deliberately teased him, \u201cIt turns out that little Zhao only likes his father, not me.\u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s face was red as he stuttered, looking for an explanation, \u201cNo\u2026no.\u201dHe raised his neck and gave her a kiss on the face and whispered in her ear, \u201cI like my mother the best.\u201d***On the day of the Lantern Festival, the queen, who had no relationship with her, sent someone to invite her to visit the palace, and specially asked her to take her child with her.Looking at the eunuch that came from the palace, Zhao Nanyu frowned, but he held Song Luan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just talk.\u201dSong Luan did not have a good impression of the imperial palace. She was still worried about the poison that Song Yu had done. However, she did not know what the queen was up to.She asked, \u201cWhy did the queen look for me? I haven\u2019t even met her.\u201dAlthough the queen was not abolished that time, all the details of her side were cut down. Her vitality was greatly damaged, and her royal son also lost the advantage of seizing the throne. Now, the only thing she could rely on was the sixth prince under her knees.Zhao Nanyu was a closed friend of the sixth prince. Maybe the queen wanted to win him over.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it. She won\u2019t dare to do anything to you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dLittle Zhao was sleeping on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s leg.She thought that the carriage was stuffy, so she lifted the curtain. She felt the wind for a while, and forgot that Zhao Nanyu was still injured. He covered his throat and coughed.Song Luan awkwardly asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your injury?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry.\u201dHis cough wouldn\u2019t stop, and hearing this, Song Luan\u2019s ears felt pain, so she quietly shut the window.When they arrived at the inner palace, Song Luan found that the queen not only invited them, but also saw He Run and Song Heqing.It was still early before the banquet would begin.Song Heqing came out of the corner, looked at both his sister and his brother-in-law, and said, \u201cI want to have a word with Ah Luan.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded and left consciously, \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter he looked at his sister\u2019s thin body, he was very distressed.After sighing, he cursed in his throat, \u201cZhao Nanyu, this dog, has made you suffer so much. Look at how thin my little sister is!\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes were red and her voice was low, as she said, \u201cBrother, I want to leave.\u201dSong Heqing touched her hair. If it was in the past, it would be easy to do what his little sister wanted. But now, it was different, Zhao Nanyu was no longer a petty official.A few days ago, when his father was almost impeached, and was about to go to prison, at the last moment, Zhao Nanyu saved him.Now the emperor was seriously ill, and sixth prince quickly took control of the power.No one dared to disobey him.Several princes were suppressed by him one by one, and the seriously ill old emperor did not stop them. The overall situation was mostly settled, and the only thing left was waiting for the imperial edict of the crown prince.Zhao Nanyu also followed the rising tide. His method was extremely vicious. He killed many people.On the day of Song Luan\u2019s miscarriage, aunt Lin went to the Zhao family to make trouble. She cried bitterly and scolded Zhao Nanyu. Not only that, she also tried to take Song Luan home and forced them to leave.At that time, Song Heqing was also there. He didn\u2019t stop aunt Lin. His sister was so wronged that they need to help her.Zhao Nanyu let aunt Lin beat and scold him, but he didn\u2019t let her take his wife away.When aunt Lin made enough trouble, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes became cold and his voice was hoarse. He threatened the future of the Song family and the lives of each members, meaning he would never let Song Luan leave him.No one dares to disobey him.Zhao Nanyu even laughed and said, \u201cEven if Song Luan runs away by herself, you must send her back to me.\u201dIt was the first time Song Heqing saw Zhao Nanyu\u2019s crazy appearance after so many years. It seems that he met the God of death.Aunt Lin was so angry at his words that she almost fainted.Now facing his beloved sister, Song Heqing was very guilty, as he touched her hair. He couldn\u2019t speak.It was silent for a long time before Song Heqing finally asked her, \u201cDon\u2019t you like him?\u201dAfter all these years of marriage, their child was already five years old.Still didn\u2019t like Zhao Nanyu?Song Luan seriously thought about her brother\u2019s question. She raised her head, and there were all kinds of mixed emotions in her eyes, as she replied, \u201cYes.\u201dYes, I did.Zhao Nanyu looked good.He was not bad.He accommodated her with many things, and she was really moved before.After a pause, she added in a low voice, \u201cBut I don\u2019t like him now.\u201dLiking him was a painful thing.Song Heqing was not the only one who heard this, but also Zhao Nanyu, who was leaning against the wall.He was pale and lifeless.Song Luan also saw something wrong with her brother.She remembered that Zhao Nanyu had gradually taken control of power, so she laughed and said, \u201cBrother, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just complaining to you.\u201dSong Heqing felt even more distressed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so sensible.\u201dHis sister should be pampered, and no one could wrong her.She was wronged because of her family\u2019s failure. If it was in the past, he could rush up and scold him, this dog, Zhao Nanyu.Song Luan said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m not sensible!\u201dIt was already an hour, but the two brothers and sisters still hadn\u2019t talked enough. Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t help but emerge from the dark, coughing twice, \u201cThe child is about to wake up.\u201dSong Heqing didn\u2019t want to see Zhao Nanyu, a small beast with a human face and a heart. \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you. Brother-in-law should be anxious.\u201dZhao Nanyu suddenly said to her, \u201cYour father was demoted.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyelids jumped.As if she didn\u2019t hear him, she raised her finger to the young man in a white-crescent clothes not far away. \u201cThat young man is really handsome.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked down at her with a faint expression, and continued with a smile. \u201cYour brother is also implicated.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know which son he is from. I\u2019ll ask him later.\u201d Song Luan then continued to provoke him.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, as he continued, \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t say it, you are scared of me, and still resent me in your heart. It doesn\u2019t matter whatever you do, but you can\u2019t think about being separated from me, even in death.\u201dSong Luan stopped talking and remained silent for a long time. Her face was cold, \u201cAre you threatening me with my family?\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded and admitted, \u201cYes.\u201dWhat about being mean and shameless? He didn\u2019t care as long as her wings were uprooted, could he rest assured.She was so angry with him that her cheeks bulged.The man was really shameless.Song Luan wanted to kill him, really.Zhao Nanyu chuckled again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask. The gentleman you mentioned just now is Shen. He has a fiancee.\u201dSong Luan smiled and\u00a0tried\u00a0to poke Zhao Nanyu\u2019s painful foot, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I like men who aren\u2019t single.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyebrows were bent, \u201cNaughty again.\u201dHe took her by the wrist, led her into an empty room, and locked the door.Zhao Nanyu pressed her on the door plank. His eyes were indiffierent, but they were very frightening. His fingers caressed her cheek silently.Song Luan spoke first, \u201cI\u2019ll climb that wall.\u201d\u201cYou are very cruel to me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Song Luan was packed up by Zhao Nanyu like a meal.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s bottom line of vinegar should not be provoke. Her mouth was bit a painful, the rouge on her lips were eaten clean by Zhao Nanyu.After lunch, the queen deliberately left to speak with the ladies, so Zhao Nanyu was left with little Zhao.She followed the noble girl into the hall. The queen was majestic, elegant, and graceful. She had on a heavy make-up, but still looked very beautiful.The queen said with a smile, \u201cCome, seat down, ladies.\u201dSong Luan sat in the second position on the queen\u2019s right hand side.The queen\u2019s eyes fell on her and asked, \u201cMiss Song, how can you be alone?\u201d\u201cThe child is naughty and has a little tantrum. His father is coaxing him now.\u201d Song Luan looked calm. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t blame me.\u201dThe queen gathered her smile and said, \u201cNaturally, I won\u2019t blame you, but I always listen to your mother saying that little Zhao is lovely, so I want to see him.\u201dNaturally, the queen\u2019s mother would not be aunt Lin, but her father\u2019s wife.\u201cI heard that you were seriously ill. Are you better now?\u201dSong Luan replied, \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dThe queen nodded and laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThe\u00a0queen\u2019s purpose was not pure, and her original goal was not Song Luan, but her son.These days, she had a hard time. She lost everything and even implicated her family. Her good stepson was not good. Zhao Nanyu, as a good aide to her stepson, wrote incisively and vividly the four words of \u2018cutting off the roots\u2019. Her family\u2019s foundation was greatly damaged, and most family members were uprooted. Her efforts over the years were wasted.Even if the sixth prince ascended the throne in the future, she would still be a noble empress dowager, but Zhao Nanyu would not let go of her son.The tenth prince, who was only 15 years old, and the baby who she painstakingly given birth to, was stabbed on the way to Jingzhou, and almost died.She was not reconciled, and gnashed her teeth with hate. Fortunately, the tenth prince survived, otherwise the queen would take Zhao Nanyu\u2019s own son to pay for her son\u2019s life.Song Luan was not as valuable as little Zhao in her eyes. She remembered that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s marriage with Song Luan was not because of love. This third young lady of the Song family was arrogant, and was far from the knowledgeable and reasonable woman that Zhao Nanyu would like. Even if she could hold Song Luan\u2019s life in her palm, she may not be able to get what she wanted from Zhao Nanyu.The queen also felt sympathy for Song Luan. She was not spoiled by her husband. Her original healthy body was also deteriorating due to a disease. She wouldn\u2019t survive without medicine.However, the queen also admired Song Luan, who lived happily and wantonly during the past few years of marriage. She had heard of her affairs. It\u2019s a pity that the generation of Song family was gone. She was afraid that Zhao Nanyu may start settling old accounts with this young wife.The queen was suddenly curious. What would Zhao Nanyu do with his wife, who only made him wore many green hats?\u201cHow many unmarried sisters do you have in your family?\u201dSong Luan was stunned, \u201cYes?\u201dBut what do you mean by her family?With a sigh, the queen picked up her tea cup and took a sip of tea. \u201cThe sixth prince has only married the imperial concubine, and there is no one around to serve him. I am thinking of taking a side concubine for the sixth prince. Your sister will be very good.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s first thought was Ayun, the round faced girl.As she hesitated in answering, the queen added, \u201cI only mentioned it casually. Naturally, you should discuss this matter with your mother.\u201d\u201cYou are right.\u201dAs they were talking, a little eunuch rushed in from the outside and whispered a few words in the queen\u2019s ear. The queen\u2019s face changed slightly, and she barely kept her calm. \u201cThere is something else I need to attend to, I\u2019m afraid this would be the end of the conversation.\u201dSong Luan got up, saluted, and left.Looking at the queen\u2019s look, what seems to be going on in the palace?What could it be?***The sixth prince was in a good mood recently. When he saw little Zhao who was hanging on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s neck, it was hard not to tease him. He pinched his face and said, \u201cAh, I haven\u2019t seen you for months, and you\u2019ve become more and more beautiful.\u201dLittle Zhao twisted his face, and didn\u2019t smile.The sixth prince was amused by his disdain appearance towards him. He took him from Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arms. \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t like me? I want to hold you.\u201dLittle Zhao lost his small face, and he almost wrote \u2018I\u2019m not happy\u2019 on his face. He held out his hand to Zhao Nanyu and waved his small hand, \u201cDad, hold it.\u201dZhao Nanyu chuckled and took him back. Sixth prince couldn\u2019t help but sighed, \u201cThis child is really like you. He looks lovely and cold-blooded. Pity me. I gave him a lot of treasures for the new year, but he refused to give me a single hug.\u201dLittle Zhao heard his speech, buried his face in his father\u2019s shoulder, like a small tortoise, retracting oneself into the shell.Zhao Nanyu patted his back with his big palm and said, \u201cThis child also has a temper.\u201dSixth prince raised his eyebrows. After pondering for a moment, he said, \u201cBring him to my palace some other day. Ayun will certainly like it when she sees him.\u201dZhao Nanyu knew that the little girl who looked like a little tail that followed him all year round was called Ayun. She looked very naive and didn\u2019t know anything about the world.Ayun held a great place in the sixth prince\u2019s heart.The sixth prince would soon get married. It seemed that the bride wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his heart.Zhao Nanyu said faintly, \u201cMy child is not for you to play.\u201dThe sixth prince looked at him with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t be stingy, Mr. Zhao.\u201dZhao Nanyu stepped two steps back. \u201cIf you like, go have your own child.\u201dSixth prince\u2019s smile at the corner of his mouth suddenly froze. He turned the buddhist beads on his wrist for a moment.He had a child, but didn\u2019t survive.He looked up at the sky in the distance. It seemed that it was also in winter. Yes, in the deep winter of last year, Ayun vomited what she ate, and she didn\u2019t know she was pregnant for several months, and didn\u2019t understand anything.Finally, he found out that it was wrong.He made her see the doctor, and found out it was a happy pulse.At that time, Ayun took his arm and her eyes were brighter than the stars in the sky. She asked, \u201cWill I really have a baby?\u201dAs a father for the first time, his heart was naturally rejoicing.But he definitely couldn\u2019t have this child with no name and identity.The sixth prince didn\u2019t want to continue to recall the incident, so he withdrew his sight. He laughed and changed the topic, \u201cBy the way, how is my mother\u2019s good son now?\u201dZhao Nanyu said lightly, \u201cAlive, but not in the future.\u201dPeople who were almost disabled would have no chance to be emperor in their life.The sixth prince sighed in a mournful tone. \u201cSpeaking of this, my younger brother is also a good boy. He\u2019s worthy of being a royal prince.\u201dWhich of the imperial cities was not covered with blood? They just thought that they didn\u2019t kill enough people yet. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hands were automatic. The hands and feet of the people were neatly discarded.The sixth prince said with a smile that had an unknown meaning, \u201cIf the queen mother knew this, she would be crazy.\u201dThat was her dearest son, the son she raised in the palm of her hand.Zhao Nanyu said calmly, \u201cI have already blocked the news. The queen should not know anything.\u201dThey could only find out that something happened on the way to Jingzhou, when he hadn\u2019t died yet.\u201cOf course, I will tell you the good news in person.\u201d The sixth prince laughed together with him, and asked excitedly, \u201cI almost forgot to ask you, what do you want to do with the people of the Song family? I remember you wanted to kill them all.\u201dAll killed? It didn\u2019t seem very good. He didn\u2019t know if he had changed his mind now.Zhao Nanyu frowned and seemed to be thinking seriously. He didn\u2019t speak for a long time. The sixth prince was impatient, so he said in a slow voice, \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to kill all of them. But it wouldn\u2019t be righteous of me to do so, after all, they showed their sincerity to me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch them.\u201d said Zhao Nanyu, frowning.This time\u2026his answer was beyond his expectations, and it was quite generous. How could the hatred of being humiliated in those years be written off? Great, he\u2019s worthy of being his cousin.The relationship between the sixth prince and Zhao Nanyu was known to no one but the old emperor.His mother was the sister of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mother. The two sisters did not live a very good life, although their appearance were outstanding, they were easily targeted by people with bad intentions.The Emperor may have really loved his mother, and was very fond of it for a time, but it brought disaster. His mother died miserably, and the sixth prince survived only after her mother died.For so many years, his father, the emperor ignored him, almost as if he had no son. But ah, the name written on imperial edict for the throne was his name. It\u2019s funny when he thought about it.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d The attendants came out.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThe emperor invites you to go to Wenhua hall.\u201dSixth prince thought that his good father would sleep forever. But whether he was awake or not, a lot of things should come to an end.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart jumped, \u201cGo. Don\u2019t be soft hearted.\u201dSixth prince clenched his lips, and said, \u201cI will not.\u201dOutside the Wenhua hall, the queen wore a splendid clothes as she waited anxiously outside the hall. Without permission, she couldn\u2019t enter even if she was a queen.The sixth highness prince saluted her, \u201cMother is well.\u201dThe queen was forced to wear a false smile, \u201cYou are here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead.\u201d\u201cGood boy, take care of your father for your mother. \u201cAt this time, both mother and son were still acting, maintaining superficial peace.\u201cThis son will surely bring his mother\u2019s sincerity to his father.\u201d When his voice fell to the ground, he pushed open the door and slowly walked in.There was a strong smell of medicine in the room. The light was very dark. Sixth prince came to the bed and knelt down slowly in front of the emperor. Looking at the half dead appearance of his father, he even had a shallow smile on his face, \u201cYou are looking for me.\u201d\u201cCough, cough, cough\u2026I\u2026cough, cough.\u201dThe sixth prince helped him up. He did not know when he had a bowl of medicine in his hand, but he was afraid that the emperor would burn his tongue when drinking it, so sixth prince blew it himself, and then gave the bowl to his mouth.\u201cI know you don\u2019t like me very much.\u201dThe emperor was choked to the throat by the soup, and the juice dripped on his chin. He opened his mouth and wanted to say something.Sixth prince gently wiped the corners of his mouth, \u201cIf you have anything to say to my mother, go and say it.\u201dSuddenly, he pinched the emperor\u2019s chin with his fingers, poured all the medicine into the emperor\u2019s throat, and watched him swallow them all with his own eyes.\u201cYou can go at ease. Don\u2019t worry, your son will not let you go alone.\u201dHis beloved woman and doting little son would go down with him one by one.The emperor glared with his round his eyes, and soon, his fingers fell.Sixth prince closed his eyes. Somehow, his eyes were moist, and he wiped a few precious tears off his face.He laughed at himself.The cat cries and the mouse pretends to be merciful.***The next day, the news of the emperor\u2019s death spread throughout the capital.Song Luan was also shocked when she heard the news. In the original book, the time of the old emperor\u2019s death was one month later than now, but nothing else changed, the final winner was the sixth prince.Another month passed in a flash. After the new emperor ascended the throne, he promoted many of his cronies. Zhao Nanyu was promoted to be a high-ranking official of the third grade, holding heavy power in his hands. He was cruel and a ruthless official that killed many people.In a short month, no less than 20 people died in his hands, and people were in panic.At the same time, there were also many people who had taken part in this month\u2019s book folding. They handed over more and more copies of the book, and complained of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s cruel behavior in tears.In the Jinluan palace, the new emperor threw these folding notes to Zhao Nanyu and said with a smile, \u201cI can\u2019t see how many of them are. I\u2019d like to trouble Mr. Zhao to share my worries for me.\u201dZhao Nanyu picked up two books at random and looked at them. He pulled up the corners of his mouth and laughed. He commented on four words, \u201cThese are bullshit.\u201dThe new emperor laughed, and then cursed with a kind of hatred: \u201cThese old men!\u201dBefore the next day, anyone who participated in reporting Zhao Nanyu\u2019s performance was escorted to Dali Temple overnight. Zhao Nanyu picked up all of them and explained innocently, \u201cThe emperor wanted to punish you, and I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cBah.\u201dZhao Nanyu stood with his hands on his back and said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to suffer in the prison of Dali temple. You\u2019d better save your strength.\u201dAlthough his clean hands were stained with many lives, they indiscriminately didn\u2019t kill innocent people.Spring was expected to be cold, and the early spring was no different than winter. It made people\u2019s teeth chatter. The cold wind was like a knife, it hurt a bit on the face.Song Luan had a restless temperament, always thinking of strolling and running out. She didn\u2019t know if the wind was blowing too much, but after returning to the room, she coughed and her chest hurt faintly.It took a long time for her face to return back to normal.That night, when Zhao Nanyu came back, she smelled blood again. Song Luan covered her nose, and was so disgusted that she jumped back several steps. \u201cWhat are you doing now!?\u201dKilling people and stealing goods?According to the plot of the original book, it was only a half of the the male lead\u2019s life story.After all, it\u2019s a two million word novel. It was impossible to finish without pouring dog blood all over the sky! The male lead achieved his wish and rose step by step. He began to settle old accounts one by one, and countless people died under him.Of course, those people were more or less self-made.The original owner was one of the avenged.According to the time line of the original book, in fact, there were less than two years to go before the original owner\u2019s life was over.Zhao Nanyu had just returned from Dali temple, and his body was inevitably stained with dirty things.The dungeon was dark and humid, and the ground had been dyed red with blood. Today, he also made an exception. He voluntarily punished them by himself, and blood was splashed on his clothes.He had been used to it for a long time, but Song Luan couldn\u2019t stand it.Zhao Nanyu said in a low voice that he was sorry, and immediately ordered his servants to fetch water. After washing and changing clothes, he appeared in front of her again.Song Luan was now indifferent to him. She was obsessed with making all kinds things for her son.Zhao Nanyu hugged her waist from behind, buried her head in her back neck, and deeply sniffed the fragrance of her body.\u201cYou go away, you\u2019re heavy.\u201dZhao Nanyu lowered her face and held her closer. \u201cI\u2019m a little tired.\u201dSong Luan pushed him away without being angry. \u201cI\u2019m very tired too.\u201dShe just didn\u2019t want to be his crutch.Zhao Nanyu sighed and let go of her. He went to the desk by herself, rubbed his eyebrows and began to deal with official documents.Song Luan raised her eyelids and secretly peeked at his face. Although the male lead was small in heart, he was not angry because of such little matter.She had seen Zhao Nanyu\u2019s cruel and merciless appearance during his anger. That time, she went to the palace to meet her brother, and was going to go home right away, but as soon as she arrived at the gate of the palace, she saw Zhao Nanyu dealing with people. The shrill screams of the person couldn\u2019t even soften his heart.Zhao Nanyu turned a blind eye to him. After he beat him to death, he mercifully said, \u201cTake Mr. Du to the hospital.\u201dSong Luan hid in the carriage, and was scared to death. The man had been beaten to the point that he couldn\u2019t speak. His whole body was covered with blood. She felt that even if he was sent to the hospital, he would not live.After this incident, Song Luan\u2019s fear of Zhao Nanyu became deeper.After a short time without disturbing him, Song Luan nervously came up to him, and called him with his first and last name, \u201cZhao Nanyu.\u201dShe tightened her fingers and said, \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201dZhao Nanyu hadn\u2019t heard a word from her for a long time, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cI want to go back to my mother\u2019s house.\u201dIf the female lead was by his side at this time, they would have started a sweet life of a million words in the novel.Zhao Nanyu bowed his head, and continued writing. He did not answer her.Song Luan was fierce that she took the brush in his hand and said, \u201cDo you agree or not?\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his head and Song Luan felt guilty when she looked in his eyes.***\u201cIf you don\u2019t promise, I will go back.\u201dZhao Nanyu chuckled sarcastically and said, \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming.\u201dSong Luan knew that he was not good at speaking. Regardless of what he said, she would go back to her mother\u2019s home this time, and would not intend to come back in time.There was no big change in the plot, and the time of the original owner\u2019s poisoning was nearing, which would happen in the spring of this year. After the poisoning, the body would be tortured for two years before it would die.There\u2019s nothing to believe in that man\u2019s mouth. According to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s character of holding grudges, Song Luan believed that after she transmigrated, she was still under the influence of poison.Tch. To love and to kill each other. How wonderful!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If anyone of you who\u2019s like Mary and wanted to stop reading, I advise that you don\u2019t! Zhao Nanyu will definitely get his retribution and the feeling will be so sweet! Ah I\u2019m also really touch by a reader who asked me if I was okay\u2026thank you so much for wanting to know if I\u2019m still alive and well (\u0e51\u2032\u0325\u0325\u0325\u25b5\u2035\u0325\u0325\u0325 \u0ac2\u0e51) why are you guys so sweet! I\u2019m definitely okay, just feeling the blues!Song Luan was sitting beside the bed, but Zhao Nanyu ignored her, and only continued to practice his calligraphy calmly.Even if Song Luan wanted to quarrel with him, he could stop her with just three or two words. As long as she didn\u2019t push his buttons, he wouldn\u2019t get angry, and would just watch her act mischievous like a fool.A few days ago, Zhao Nanyu took care of her even when the situation in the capital was uncertain. Now that the overall situation was settled, he had already gotten the power that he wanted. How could he possibly let her go? The number of people guarding in the dark also hadn\u2019t decreased.Song Luan took off her shoes and socks and tucked herself in the quilt. After sleeping for a while, she felt so hot that she stretched her bare feet out of the bed.Zhao Nanyu knew that she couldn\u2019t sleep, so he didn\u2019t write nor read any words anymore. He went to the bedside and took off his clothes. Song Luan was still angry at him. After thinking about it, what should she do with this little pervert?She turned around in silence and faced him. Her bright eyes were looking at him expectantly.Before she could make a sound, Zhao Nanyu had already opened his mouth, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to take you back at noon tomorrow, and you\u2019ll come back in the evening.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s words were forced in her throat. She softened her voice and squeezed out a very sweet smile on her face. \u201cHow can this be enough? You can give me two more days. It\u2019s not that I won\u2019t come back.\u201dZhao Nanyu embraced her shoulders, and pressed her small head in his arms. He closed his eyes, hooked his lips, and said, \u201cThen you can\u2019t go.\u201dSong Luan swallowed her anger, and forced a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re my magnanimous husband.\u201dZhao Nanyu laughed and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll send you in the morning. Isn\u2019t that a long time? It will be enough.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so angry that I can\u2019t make sense with you.\u201dIt\u2019s useless reasoning with him.It\u2019s strange that Zhao Nanyu could always guess what she\u2019s thinking. She arched out her arms, but was pulled back by the man behind her as soon as the quilt was covered.That night, in Song Luan\u2019s long dream, there was a woman she had never seen before. She was wearing her familiar bright red dress, and her hair was decorated with flower ornaments.She was gorgeous and exquisite.She stood on the tower with her hair tied high. The cold wind swayed her dress. The expression on her face seemed very sad. No, it was not just sad, but it was a kind of despair.The desperate smile on her lips seemed to show she didn\u2019t have any attachment to this world.Her hands were tightly tied behind her, surrounded by a circle of armored soldiers, their sharp knives facing her. It\u2019s as if one single movement of hers would trigger the ten thousand swords in front of her to pierce her heart.With the sound of \u2018zhu\u2019, a sharp arrow passed by Song Luan\u2019s ear, and the woman on the tower was shot directly. The person who shot the arrow was very skillful because it precisely pierced the center of her heart.Song Luan couldn\u2019t tell whether it was a dream or not, but she could almost hear the sound of the arrow cutting through the cloth.The arrow seemed to have been shot in her heart. Her chest was suddenly filled with severe pain. In betweens of being awake and being asleep, she saw the young taoist who she had met once. His expressionless face whispered faintly on her ear, \u201cDid you see that? That is you.\u201dSong Luan covered her chest, and was unable to stand straight.She was woken up by Zhao Nanyu.When she woke up, her head was covered with sweat and her face was pale. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s dark eyes looked at her motionlessly, and his eyes were even more worried. He asked, \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201dHe gently wiped her tears, as he sighed, \u201cIf you really want to stay with your mother for a few more days, it\u2019s not impossible.\u201dIn the dream, although the sharp arrow that penetrated the heart disappeared, her chest still felt a little dull, and there was a kind of stagnant air hovering above it.She suddenly stretched out her hand and hugged Zhao Nanyu\u2019s waist. She desperately looked at him and said, \u201cMy chest hurts.\u201dWho was that young taoist? He obviously knew more than she did. What was this weird dream? Why was the woman who was pierced by an arrow on top of the tower in her dream familiar?Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face changed slightly, and the blood color of his lips faded a little. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask Zhao Chao to come and see you.\u201dThis time he invited not a doctor, but Zhao Chao.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was as white as paper. With his eyes closed, he could still remember the symptom of tianqing.At first, it would start with only a trivial pain, but slowly, the ache would gradually deepen, corroding her internal organs step by step, and the person under this poison would die slowly in great pain.Song Luan looked up at him and said, \u201cCan you call someone else? Your brother still hates me.\u201d\u201cHe dares not.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Nanyu moved, and was planning to get up and dressed, but Song Luan\u2019s chest was stuffy, and she was still very uncomfortable, so she held his waist and refused to let go. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Stay with me for a while.\u201dHolding him could make her feel at ease.Zhao Nanyu was shocked, but he nodded, and said gentle words to her, while his fingers gently brushed her hair. \u201cDo you want to sleep for a while? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just hold you. I don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d She wrapped her hands and legs around him, clinging closely to his lead body, rubbing every inch, \u201cYou are so comfortable.\u201dFragrant, warm.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mood gradually changed by her constant rubbing, his eyes became dark, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dA man who hadn\u2019t had sex for two months couldn\u2019t stand the slightest provocation.His ferociousness could leave her half dead.***Zhao Chao\u2019s marriage meetings came one after another, but his mother had no way to force him. His parents were in a hurry, but he himself was not, so he didn\u2019t take it to heart.When his second elder brother invited him to live in Huai Shui Residence, Zhao Chao was happy in his heart, because he didn\u2019t need to listen to his mother\u2019s thoughts.After he arrived, Zhao Chao found that his second brother\u2019s face was not very good, and the air pressure around him was heavy. He unfolded his fan and half jokingly said, \u201cSecond brother can get angry in the morning?\u201dZhao Nanyu pursed his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t have the heart to laugh with you. You carefully check the pulse of your second sister-in-law.\u201dZhao Chao\u2019s fingers stopped, and he began to show his upright smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhao Nanyu took a deep breath. His throat was hoarse, and his original voice couldn\u2019t be heard. He said, \u201cAre you sure that the amount of poison I took before is not enough to kill her?\u201dIn fact, he stopped the drug early summer last year.Before Zhao Nanyu fell in love with Song Luan, he still wanted her to die.Song Luan\u2019s temperament began to change obviously. At that time, he thought she was pretending, so he still didn\u2019t show mercy.It was when spring had passed that he completely put off his killing intention. He stopped the poison in the early summer.Zhao Chao was silent, and could only say, \u201cMy master is eccentric. He only makes poisons, not antidotes. But last time when I checked sister-in-law, I didn\u2019t see any signs of poisoning.\u201dEither the time was short, or the quantity was insufficient. Zhao Chao was not clear which one it was.\u201cGo and see her,\u201d Zhao Nanyu said.In any case, he would not let her die.Zhao Nanyu pulled up the corner of his mouth and laughed. He couldn\u2019t let her die in his own hands.Song Luan came out of the house, her clothes were light and flowing. It showed her full waist.She stood in the sunlight, the golden light poured down, and it evenly sprinkled on her body. Her skin looked fair and beautiful.Zhao Chao shook for a moment. He quickly retracted his eyes, stepped back two steps, and said, \u201cSecond sister-in-law.\u201dSong Luan pretended to smile at him. \u201cThird brother.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to get angry with Zhao Chao, fortunately, he didn\u2019t look at her with eyes full of scorn.The two didn\u2019t have much to talk about, so Song Luan took the lead in saying, \u201cI heard from my mother that you have been meeting with a lot of girls these days. Is there anyone you like?\u201dZhao Chao frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dSong Luan had no intentions of worrying about it. She just had nothing to say. The atmosphere was too awkward, so she just picked up a random topic. She didn\u2019t know that it would irritate him.\u201cMy mouth talks a lot.\u201d Song Luan said.Zhao Chao asked, \u201cI heard from second elder brother that second sister-in-law is not feeling well these days?\u201dSong Luan put on her make-up, so he couldn\u2019t see how she looked. \u201cIt\u2019s the old symptoms.\u201dZhao Nanyu knew that she didn\u2019t want to see Zhao Chao, but he was not willing to let her see a doctor, so he held her hand and said, \u201cLet the third brother check your pulse first.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t want to make trouble, so she sat down and stretched out her hand.She had a speculation in her heart that before she fainted, the pain in her heart was only just a prelude.At present, there was no way to change the ending of the plot directly related to the original owner. The days of the original owner\u2019s poisoning would not change.It would be one day this spring.Maybe it was today.He put his finger on her pulse and held his breath. After a while, Song Luan found that Zhao Chao\u2019s face gradually became ugly. He gave her a deep look, and hesitantly spoke, \u201cSecond sister-in-law\u2026\u201dZhao Chao found that Song Luan\u2019s heart had been eroded very badly.It\u2019s clear that there was no diagnosis last time.\u201cWhat happened to me? I feel very good. Both my waist and legs do not ache. I can eat and drink. I can also jump.\u201dWhy did Zhao Chao look at her with that expression that she was dying? Didn\u2019t he know it\u2019s bad and unlucky?She hated this kind of look that made her believe she would die!Zhao Chao did not know how to make a sound for a moment, so he had to shut his mouth.He only gave her a silent response.It took Zhao Nanyu a long time to find his voice. His bones turned white, as he asked, \u201cHow is she? Please tell the truth.\u201d\u201cNot so good.\u201dZhao Chao didn\u2019t want to say those words in front of Song Luan. He once hoped that Song Luan would die. But now, he couldn\u2019t bear to, what should his second brother do?Killed the woman he loves? He couldn\u2019t stand it.Song Luan looked at Zhao Nanyu dead-white face. His lean body seems like it would be blown by the wind. He was really worried about her.Song Luan took Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arm and said, \u201cI\u2019m really good. These are all old problems. Don\u2019t make a fuss about it. Oh, I\u2019m in a hurry to see\u2026poof..\u201dBefore she could finish talking, Song Luan\u2019s throat was filled with blood, and the corners of her mouth slowly oozed with blood, which accidentally got on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s clothes.Truly.The original book was now retaliating against her!!! Not a single thing.[The dazzling sunshine was a little bright. The wind in early spring was cool. The magnolia flowers on the branches and the petals were swinging with the wind. Song Luan held the tree trunk, and a mouthful of blood spurted out from her lips.]Song Luan looked at the magnolia flower blooming in the yard. She was very sure that she was poisoned. She slowly moved her eyes to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face and wanted to tell him that he didn\u2019t need to be sad.Save your energy and wait for me to die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MarySong Luan really didn\u2019t feel much. Even at the moment of vomiting, she felt relieved. At last, she didn\u2019t have to be afraid.Zhao Nanyu really poisoned her. She couldn\u2019t avoid fate.When she actually faced this moment, she was rather indifferent.However, Song Luan\u2019s desire for survival was still strong. She didn\u2019t want to die.No matter what era she was in, she didn\u2019t want to die.Life is so beautiful.She also had a lot of things she hadn\u2019t done yet.She didn\u2019t have a good relationship with others yet and still couldn\u2019t bear to die like this.She relied on Zhao Nanyu, and still had the strength to smile at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can go back to my mother\u2019s home today.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t breathe, and her heart was dull and painful. At this moment, she felt the whirling feeling that she had only read in the book.Her hands and feet were cold, and she had no strength. The corner of her eyes were moist, her little hand took his sleeve, and shook him. Her voice became smaller and smaller, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201dI really don\u2019t want to.Why was it her? She only read the book and was inexplicably transported.Even if she transmigrated, why did it have to be in a rubbish script setting! She couldn\u2019t change anything, because she transmigrated too late.Song Luan began to think\u2026was it at the beginning when she made a bad comment under the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019? She wrote a dog blood comment, and got retribution?She had always been working hard. Song Luan was more and more aggrieved, clearly she did nothing wrong.Thinking of this, Song Luan cried. Her hot tears rolled down in string. Her cheeks were moist and her eyes were red.Zhao Nanyu thought that she was crying because of pain. He held her and took a deep breath, as he said in a low voice, \u201cYou won\u2019t die. Don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dHe was not disgusted with her dirt. He gently wiped the blood from the corners of her mouth with his sleeves.Song Luan was carried into the room by him. She knew that he was also very sad. His eyes were full of blood, and his face was completely bloodless.Such a man with everything under control could panic.After suddenly vomiting blood, Song Luan felt that her chest was not so stuffy.She still had no strength. Her upper and lower eyelids were fighting the drowsiness.Zhao Chao just took the pulse for her. Without his second brother\u2019s command, he immediately said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to make the medicine.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t come up with an antidote, so he had to prescribe some soothing drugs.Song Luan was only vomiting blood now. She would gradually feel the pain later on. The poison would slowly permeate her organs and corrode her lungs.This attack would last for several years.As soon as Song Luan laid on the bed, she went to sleep, and didn\u2019t have to think about anything.She felt that Zhao Nanyu had been by her side. This person had everything under his control, but now he looked helpless.They had looked for Zhao Chao\u2019s master for more than a year already, but still couldn\u2019t find him.Whenever they managed to catch a clue, they would soon lose track.It was getting dark, and Song Luan was sleeping for a day. The ups and downs of her chest gradually calmed down, and her breath slowly subsided.Zhao Nanyu held her hand and sat by the bedside all day. There was no light in the room. His face that looked slightly sharp, was deeply immersed in the darkness.She could not see the expression on his face.When Zhao Nanyu gave her a dose of medicine, Song Luan was very obedient and swallowed it all.After a long time, Song Luan finally opened her eyes and blinked. She slowly sat up from the bed, while murmuring, \u201cIt\u2019s so dark.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to put on the light.\u201d Zhao Nanyu\u2019s voice was hoarse, and she was startled.The candle was lighted, but it was not very bright. Song Luan could now see his face clearly.Under the warm light, the white and delicate face of Zhao Nanyu was reflected. His clothes had not been changed, and her blood was still on his white robes. Song Luan swallowed her saliva\u00a0 and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you change your clothes?\u201dZhao Nanyu loves to be clean! His cleanliness-obsession is very serious. He always had to change a set of clothes whenever he came back from work.\u201cForgot.\u201d\u201cThen go to the bath, and change clothes. I\u2019m awake. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Song Luan tried to use her usual tone of speaking.Zhao Nanyu nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dListening to the sound of the water, Song Luan was in a complicated mood. She opened the quilt and got out of bed. She put on her shoes and went out directly. As expected, it was a mess.Several vases on the bookshelf were broken, and the desk was in disorder. It seems that no one came in to clean it up.Zhao Nanyu changed his clothes and didn\u2019t see her. He looked at her thin back, his jaw tightened, and stared deeply.Her back was ethereal, as if she would leave any time.\u201cWhy did you get out of bed?\u201d He asked.Song Luan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not made of glass.\u201dShe said in a tone of indifference, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just spitting blood?\u201dHer mentality was really good! Great!Zhao Nanyu took her cold hand and touched it gently. \u201cGo in.\u201dSong Luan stood still, and smelled the light fragrance of his body. She pointed to the debris on the ground, and asked, \u201cDid you lose your temper this afternoon?\u201dShe remembered that the vase on the shelf was very valuable. When she planned to run away, she thought about whether to take it with her, but gave up the idea because it was too big.Now that it was broken by Zhao Nanyu, she felt that it was a pity. It could be changed for money.Zhao Nanyu admitted.Not only did he lose his temper, but threw a great fit. He scared the maidservants, thus they were afraid to step into the room to clean up the debris.Zhao Chao told him that there was no other way but to wait.Song Luan sighed and lamented, \u201cI haven\u2019t ever seen you throw things.\u201dHe could always keep calm, at least on the surface. No one could see anything wrong, even if he was really angry, he would only secretly make some means to take revenge.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s lips rose slightly. He wanted to smile but couldn\u2019t.Song Luan turned around, and looked up to see his facial features clearly.He is good-looking, everywhere is beautiful, flawless and perfect.\u201cAh Yu.\u201dShe hadn\u2019t called him that for a long time.Zhao Nanyu stroked her soft hair and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t smash expensive things next time.\u201d She was a little distressed.Zhao Nanyu was slightly dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t expect that she could still say unimportant words.\u201cOkay.\u201dSong Luan slept for a day, and was naturally not sleepy at this time. She rolled around on the bed with the quilt.Zhao Nanyu was amused at the way she wrapped herself in a cocoon. He pulled the person out of the cocoon, and said, \u201cDrink the medicine.\u201d\u201cZhao Chao\u2019s medicine?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs his master a legendary doctor!?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOkay. She would obediently drink the medicine.Without needing to coax her, she held the bowl up her neck and drank the medicine completely, just like she was drinking water.But Zhao Chao\u2019s medicine was really bitter, her facial features wrinkled together, and she felt a little nauseous. This medicine was worse than all the medicine she had ever drunk before.Sure enough, the legendary doctor was different.\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been with me all day. Are you not busy with your own work? You go to work quickly! Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m fine.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t ask anything. She guessed that after she transmigrated, Zhao Nanyu had still continued to poison her.She seems to know everything.She felt a little pity for herself and Zhao Nanyu.The man loves her, but in the end, she would be killed by him.Fate made them.Song Luan remembered deeply how the original owner died. The sharp edge of the dagger was aimed at her heart, and it was held by Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand.It hurts to think about it.She may have dug up the man\u2019s grave in her last life, took out his body, and whipped it. This might be the reason why she was suffering in this life.It\u2019s too miserable.Zhao Nanyu was still looking at her with deep eyes.\u201cYou have a rest.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not sleepy. \u201c\u201cYou have to rest.\u201d He insisted.Song Luan couldn\u2019t help but hammer him with her fist, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you rest!?\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his lips and said, \u201cYou asked me to go work.\u201dSong Luan looked up at him with her head raised. \u201cWell, I changed my mind. You are not allowed to go.\u201d\u201cGood. \u201cShe was so stupid that she didn\u2019t know she was in his pocket.Song Luan hummed, and laid back on the bed, her back facing him.***Song Luan\u2019s chance to go back to her mother\u2019s home was ruined last time. Zhao Nanyu looked over her intensely. She was always guarded.Most of the time, it was Zhao Nanyu who accompanied her personally.He wouldn\u2019t say a word, just holding her wrist was enough.But Song Luan\u2019s condition was not much better. She often coughed up blood. She dared not let Zhao Nanyu see her handkerchief with blood in her hand. His eyes were too terrible and eerie.The male lead himself was an extremely\u00a0 dark character, Song Luan was really afraid of his blackening on the spot.But as she coughed more and more times, she coughed up more blood than before.Fortunately, the medicine of Zhao Chao began to take effect, and Song Luan\u2019s frequency of coughing up blood decreased at a speed visible to the naked eye.She had no chance to breathe. She had been suffocated for a long time.Taking advantage of the fine weather, and the fact that Zhao Nanyu was not at home. She made a kite and flew it in the yard.After two laps, she was sweating and panting.The kite flew too high, the line broke in half, and her tiger kite fell outside the wall.Song Luan subconsciously wanted to climb up the wall, and take down the tiger kite on the elm tree outside the courtyard. She raised her foot, but took it back again.If Zhao Nanyu saw, he would break her dog legs.This man was getting darker and darker. In the middle of the night, sometimes when her throat was dry, and wanted to get up and drink, she would always come face to face with his clear eyes.Dark and deep, with eyes full of countless extreme emotions, looking straight at her.Song Luan\u2019s scalp felt numbed, and her heart palpitated.He was more domineering than ever before. He didn\u2019t let her go outside, or anything that exerted her strength. He regarded her as a fragile doll.Song Luan instructed the bodyguard, \u201cGo and help me get the kite back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJust as she was about to take out her handkerchief to wipe the sweat from her forehead, she saw an extra hand. A plain handkerchief was handed to her, and the man sighed, \u201cYou.\u201dPlease tolerate this poor woman who would someday die.Song Luan wanted to say this sentence very much, but because of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sensitivity these days whenever he looked at her, she just swallowed back.She was not as flexible as before.Everything was moving towards the original plot.To be honest, Song Luan didn\u2019t want to die in his hands. If there was no way to go in the end, she would silently avoid it, and she would come to greet death from a distance.The male lead had a glass heart, and will be in extreme sorrow.The sorrow would blacken his heart.What if he cried while holding her?Song Luan really couldn\u2019t imagine the male lead\u2019s crying appearance, she suddenly laughed out loud.Zhao Nanyu raised her chin with two fingers. \u201cAre you in a good mood?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MarySong Luan\u2019s face was tender and smooth enough that it could pinch water. After coughing twice, she whispered, \u201cYes.\u201dEven if the weather was good in spring, it was still cold. Zhao Nanyu wrapped her in his arms with his cloak, kissed her forehead, and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s cold outside. It\u2019s better to stay indoors.\u201dHer body couldn\u2019t stand a slightest oversight.Song Luan obediently shrunk in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m suffocated by staying in the room every day. And I\u2019m much better these two days. Coming out to breath is nothing.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t say anything to her, but punished the servants around her. His voice was a little cold, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say? Don\u2019t let her out without my permission.\u201dHowever, if Song Luan really wanted to do something, no one could dare stop her. They had all seen the appearance of this young lady losing her temper before.Zhao Nanyu rubbed his eyebrows and called in his guards. He said in a cold voice, \u201cLook for two obedient girls to serve her.\u201dObedience meant to listen to his words, and those servants should not be afraid of Song Luan.\u201cYes. I\u2019ll do it now.\u201dSong Luan was already asleep.After returning to the room, she had wanted to read two books. She took one from the bookshelf, and the dense words in it made her feel dizzy and drowsy.Zhao Nanyu returned, and saw that she was lying on the cushion. Her whole face was buried in the book. He went over and covered her with a blanket. He gently pulled out the book in her hand. Her cheeks were a little reddish, and her mouth was slightly pursed. She didn\u2019t seem to be sleeping very well, because of her turning around and changing her posture every once in a while.Zhao Nanyu hugged her for fear that she would catch a cold. However, this woke Song Luan up, her long eyelashes moving, as she opened her eyes slowly, feeling confused. She rubbed her eyes, yawned, and asked, \u201cDid I just fall asleep?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He then asked, \u201cAre you still sleepy? Do you want to go back to sleep?\u201dSong Luan looked out, and seeing it wasn\u2019t dark yet, she shook her head and said, \u201cI won\u2019t sleep.\u201dAs her mind cleared up, she put her arm around his neck and said, \u201cThis book can make people dizzy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy you some folk scripts tomorrow.\u201dZhao Nanyu also knew that she was not a reasonable person, and couldn\u2019t bear to stay inside her room. It was unfortunate that he was busy these days, and couldn\u2019t accompany her.Song Luan still had a high fever at night. She was still talking nonsense in her dream. Her face turned pale again, losing a lot of blood color. These days, she had lost a lot of weight. She didn\u2019t look as plump as before. She was so weak that she could be broken with a mere twist.Zhao Chao was not in the residence, so Zhao Nanyu called the doctor to come and prescribed a dose of antipyretic medicine. Song Luan gradually got better after drinking the medicine, and the temperature on her forehead didn\u2019t drop until the latter half of the night.After tossing in her sleep, it was almost dawn.Song Luan\u2019s consciousness was dim. She didn\u2019t respond much to what happened outside. She didn\u2019t even open her eyes, she just felt that she didn\u2019t sleep well. She couldn\u2019t even remember the words she hummed in her mouth.She woke up feeling fresh the next day. Zhao Nanyu must have wiped her sweat last night.She sat up quietly from the bed. In front of the window coffin silently stood a man with a lean body, and a gloomy aura.When he felt Song Luan\u2019s gaze, Zhao Nanyu turned around and saw her sitting on the bed.The deep shadow in his eyes gradually dissipated. \u201cAwake?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s brain was still in a daze. \u201cYes.\u201dShe opened her mouth, and wanted to explain that she was really not that weak. After a second thought, it seemed that it wasn\u2019t needed, because even she did not believe her own words.Song Luan sighed. Zhao Nanyu would be stricter with her in the future.She did not expect that her body\u2019s immunity had become so bad that when she just got hit by a bit of wind outside, she fell ill immediately. It was really terrible.She finally understood why the original owner wanted to die. She slowly felt that all the organs in her body were damaged. She felt the pain from her five internal organs, which felt worse than that being disabled.A chilling air spread through her mind, when Song Luan thought of the days to come.Her fingers were shaking uncontrollably. Zhao Nanyu held her hand in the palm of his hand and asked, \u201cIs it cold?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d She had a hoarse voice.Zhao Nanyu asked again, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry. I want to eat dumplings.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dSoon, a bowl of hot dumplings was brought to her.Song Luan was really hungry, but when she ate only a few dumplings, she felt full already.She put the bowl back and refused to eat any more.\u201cEat more. You only ate a few.\u201d If she went on like this, she would be very thin.\u201cI really can\u2019t eat it.\u201dEven if Song Luan pulled his sleeve and acted coquettish, it didn\u2019t work. Zhao Nanyu gently pinched her jaw and forced her to open her mouth. \u201cIf you eat this bowl, I won\u2019t force you.\u201dSong Luan was forced by him to eat more. She frowned, and tried to avoid the spoon. She looked at him pitifully and said, \u201cI can\u2019t eat anymore. I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201dShe felt some nausea. It was very uncomfortable.Zhao Nanyu sighed and finally let her off.Song Luan disliked the smell of dumplings in the room, so she had to get out of bed and open the window. Zhao Nanyu held her hand down to keep her from moving, \u201cStill want to open the window? Being ill again is not enough, right?\u201dSong Luan shook her head, looked at him innocently and said, \u201cThe smell of the dumpling is too strong, I want to open the window for it to go out.\u201dZhao Nanyu wrapped her up tightly, then reluctantly agreed. He went to the window and opened a little crack for her.Song Luan was still suffering from a low fever.She guessed that Zhao Nanyu would not let her out of the room until the weather was warm.The people who had been waiting on Song Luan\u2019s side had also been replaced by some iron hearted little girls. She didn\u2019t know where they came from, and guessed that these people were all good at martial arts.Song Luan couldn\u2019t help but miss her former servant girls. They were soft and cute. If she pretended to be a ruthless lady, they would relent and obey what she wanted. Unlike now\u2026No freedom! No right!*Sobbing, sobbing.*But Song Luan was also good at understanding, thinking that Zhao Nanyu might be doing this for her own good, what could she do? Just put up with it.***After the Spring Festival, little Zhao officially went to private school to study. Naturally, a little boy like him didn\u2019t have to live in a boarding house, and he could go home every day, but Zhao Nanyu was strict and regularly checked his homework every day.Song Luan could only see this child five or six times a month. As soon as the new year was over, he was as tall as a branch, and his height was much taller.However, the child\u2019s temper did not change much. He was indifferent to outsiders and didn\u2019t smile a lot.Only when he saw his mother, would he smile.Before that, Song Luan was still having a fever. She was afraid that she would pass the disease on him, and didn\u2019t allow him to come.After the fever completely subsided, and she no longer coughed, little Zhao came to see her again.Zhao Wenyan also came, and he looked calmer than before the last time she saw him. There was no malice in his eyes, but his mouth had nothing good to say.She hadn\u2019t seen outsiders for a long time, so when someone came to talk to her, she felt very happy!She winked at Zhao Wenyan and tried to speak to him in an elder\u2019s voice. \u201cAh Yan, I heard your mother say that your marriage is settled?\u201dShe covered her mouth and laughed. \u201cCongratulations.\u201dThird lady Zhao once came to check her fever, and casually mentioned it. Song Luan could see that third lady Zhao was very satisfied with her future daughter-in-law.In the original book, Zhao Wenyan didn\u2019t get a wife from the beginning to the end. It was only the original owner in his eyes. This time, when Song Luan heard that he could have a good home, she was really happy for him.Zhao Wenyan smiled, \u201cThank you, second sister-in-law.\u201d***Besides congratulating him, Song Luan also wanted to know which wife Zhao Wenyan would have in the future?\u201cI don\u2019t know who the lucky girl is.\u201d\u201cI thought my mother told you everything. Do you still need to ask me?\u201dSong Luan laughed, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to say it.\u201dIn fact, she was not so curious. She would have known sooner or later.Song Luan just couldn\u2019t understand Zhao Wenyan\u2019s temper? She laughed and shook her head.She couldn\u2019t understand what these young people were thinking.Zhao Wenyan couldn\u2019t get everything out in one breath. \u201cShe\u2019s a knowledgeable and reasonable lady. In short, she is better than you! She is more sensible than you, and she recognizes more words than you.\u201dThe original owner who only loved beauty, and only had interest in gold, silver, and jewelry. Of course, she couldn\u2019t recognize too many words.Song Luan, who transmigrated, was also stumbling to understand the font of this dynasty, so she couldn\u2019t complain. She would fall asleep every time she read a book. It\u2019s not too much to say that she was half illiterate.\u201cOkay.\u201d Song Luan didn\u2019t care.Zhao Wenyan seemed to be frustrated. He stood up, and turned to leave. As soon as he got to the door, he remembered what he had come for. He turned around angrily and put the things he had brought on the table.\u201cThis is what I\u2026\u201d He said, but immediately changed his tone. \u201cThis is the tonic my mother asked me to give you. Don\u2019t ask too much. This medicine is a good one. Just take it. It\u2019s disgusting to see you look sick.\u201dWeak\u2026like dying.Song Luan said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou should\u00a0 mind your own business. Don\u2019t worry about others.\u201d He pointed to the box he had brought, \u201cThere is a valuable snow lotus in it. You don\u2019t\u2026waste my mother\u2019s kindness.\u201d\u201cI thank mother in Ah Luan\u2019s behalf.\u201d Zhao Nanyu came back from the outside in a cold air.His eyes turned around to look at Zhao Wenyan, and finally fell on the snow lotus plant he had brought. \u201cMother really took too much trouble.\u201dThis was not what the third lady asked him to bring, but Zhao Wenyan spent a lot of money to buy it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you guys want comedy, romance, and school life type of story (this is for you! lol)Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MaryZhao Wenyan disdained lying ever since he was young, so he seldom tells lies. When he met his brother\u2019s sharp eyes, he felt guilty, and coughed twice. He said, \u201cSecond brother, I have something else to do. I\u2019ll go first.\u201dZhao Nan Yu nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dZhao Wenyan just barely escaped from the room. He always felt even his careful thinking could not hide anything from his second brother.Zhao Wenyan didn\u2019t know what he was thinking when he got the snow lotus flower, because when he first saw it, he couldn\u2019t help but buy it for her.He also heard about Song Luan\u2019s illness during the Spring Festival. However, his second brother didn\u2019t let anyone come to see her. Zhao Wenyan didn\u2019t want to ask for trouble, so he kept silent.He had just finished the exam and just returned home. He heard again from his mother about his second sister-in-law\u2019s illness, so he came to have a look.Zhao Wenyan still thought that Song Luan was still beautiful even if she was ill. Her delicate body made people feel distressed.He didn\u2019t fall in love with his second sister-in-law. He just felt that she was not as annoying as before. Zhao Wenyan discovered that Song Luan had a delicate and graceful side. She was weak and dignified.The people in Huai Shui residence were so tight that he couldn\u2019t find out what was wrong with Song Luan, and how her face turned so pale.It\u2019s the early spring, but Song Luan was dressed so tightly, and the room was full of carbon fire.Just now when Zhao Wenyan stayed inside for a while, his forehead was already sweating. He didn\u2019t know how his second brother could endure it.When Zhao Wenyan left, he didn\u2019t close the door. The wind blew into the room, and Song Luan shivered as she stood right in the wind.She felt that she was more and more afraid of the cold after she became sick again.Zhao Nanyu closed the door for her in silence. His slender fingers gently picked up the snow lotus on the table, and said with a cold smile, \u201cAh Yan is arrogant. It\u2019s rare for him having this sort of behaviour.\u201dSong Luan rubbed her hands. Sure enough, she didn\u2019t notice the irony and sourness in his voice. She took the snow lotus from his hands, and said, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for third lady Zhao, he wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201dZhao Nanyu laughed and flicked his finger at her forehead. \u201cSilly.\u201dShe believed what others say.Song Luan stared at the snow lotus in her palm for a long time. After looking at it for a long time, she put it back into the box, licked her lips, and narrowed her eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019ll stew this flower tonight.\u201dSnow lotus was a noble and rare plant. She had only seen this in books before.Zhao Nanyu took a sip of tea and said, \u201cWhat about little Zhao?\u201d\u201cI told him to go inside.\u201d She was talking to Zhao Wenyan just now, and the arrogant child refused to go. Song Luan was afraid that little Zhao would hear something he was not supposed to, so she let the child go.With a sigh, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll go in and see him.\u201dLittle Zhao straightened his back and sat upright in front of the desk. His small face, which was originally white and tender, was a little red. He took off his jacket and outer shirt, so he would feel comfortable.Song Luan\u2019s temperature was lower than that of ordinary people. Naturally, she didn\u2019t feel the hotness in the room. Zhao Nanyu was extremely tolerant. He had never complained or wiped his sweat. Therefore, Song Luan thought that the temperature in the room was just right for anyone.She took out a handkerchief from her sleeve, took little Zhao to her lap, and gently wiped the sweat off his forehead.\u201cOpen the window when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t be stupid. If you sweat, you\u2019ll get sick.\u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s face was still red, \u201cIt\u2019s not hot.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sweating and you say you\u2019re not hot?\u201d Song Luan pinched his face with a smile. \u201cLying is not good for children.\u201dSong Luan immediately got up and held him in her arms. She went to the window and propped up the window pane. The cool wind rushed into the room and dissipated the heat inside.He pulled Song Luan\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cMother, close the window. I\u2019m not hot.\u201dFather said that mother\u2019s health was not good, and shouldn\u2019t be exposed to cold air\u2026Song Luan touched his head, smiling, \u201cHow many words have you just written? Can I have a look? I\u2019d like to see if we\u2019ve made progress in memorizing the characters.\u201dLittle Zhao ignored her, and wriggled out his body from her bosom. His mother intentionally changed the topic and refused to close the window, so he went by himself, and climbed on the bench.Song Luan patted him on the back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with hugging? You don\u2019t like me anymore?\u201dWhen he heard her words, he did not move. His expression was mournful and his eyes were down. He looked at her as if he was wronged, with a pair of wet black eyes. \u201cClose the window.\u201dThis child was also very stubborn. Song Luan realized this a long time ago. With Zhao Nanyu\u2019s character, she couldn\u2019t change her son\u2019s stubbornness.After opening the window for awhile, the room was not as hot as before.Song Luan closed the window again according to little Zhao\u2019s wishes. He put his little head on her shoulder and said to her in a small voice, \u201cYesterday, the teacher praised my words.\u201dHe copied how his father wrote. It was good to be able to learn the shape at this age.Song Luan went to the table and took out his copy of the font and found that it was really good, much better than hers.She praised, \u201cIt\u2019s really good, little Zhao!\u201dThe child\u2019s eyes were bent with a smile. It was a happy day to be praised by his mother.Song Luan said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask someone to frame it tomorrow and hang it on the wall?\u201dHe was too shy to raise his head, while he blushed, and said shyly, \u201cNo\u2026no.\u201dSong Luan pursed a smile, teasing the child was really interesting. She liked to make the expressionless-son laugh.Her son was the most lovely.However, after holding him for so long, Song Luan\u2019s arm felt a little sour. Zhao Nanyu opened the curtain and walked in from outside. His eyes were cold. He looked at little Zhao.He was not happy, while looking at him with deep eyes. He said in a deep voice, \u201cCome down from your mother.\u201dSong Luan put him down, and glared at Zhao Nanyu. \u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201dZhao Nanyu frowned and said, \u201cHe is not young anymore, but he always clings to his mother.\u201dHe felt that his voice was too heavy just now, so he squatted down, and waved to little Zhao. \u201cCome here.\u201dLittle Zhao stepped on his little boots and ran to him. Zhao Nanyu caught him and lowered his voice, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we become more sensible when we\u2019re a year older? Don\u2019t pester your mother all the time.\u201dLittle Zhao silently listened, and didn\u2019t say anything.Zhao Nanyu thought that the child hadn\u2019t seen his mother for so many days, so he (LZ) was having a temper with him(ZN).He stood up and said slowly, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be angry. I\u2019ll test your homework.\u201dSong Luan knew that ancient people were intelligent. They went to school at the age of three, and got married at puberty.She interrupted, \u201cHe passed the exam, and he did well in his studies.\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows and laughed, \u201cDid you test him?\u201dHis mocking smile towards her was too obvious.Song Luan\u2019s face turned red when she was teased by him. Although she was a high intellectual in modern times, she was half illiterate when she came here.She said, \u201cWell! I tested him. What about it?\u201dZhao Nanyu pressed his hand against her lips, and said with a smile, \u201cWell, since you tested him, I won\u2019t test his homework.\u201d***The weather was completely warm after the cold spring had passed.However, the carbon fire in Song Luan\u2019s room was still burning. No one dared to extinguish it. Song Luan had no spirit after staying in the room for a long time, she wanted to go to the yard to bask in the sun.As for kite flying, she dare not even think about it. Zhao Nanyu certainly won\u2019t allow her to fly a kite. The two servant girls around her were also watching closely.Zhao Nanyu spent most of his time at home, but his confidants came to the Zhao residence to discuss important matters with him, and they were mostly in his study.After Song Luan slept in the sun with a warm blanket, she stretched her arms, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the study to see him.\u201dThe two maidservants wanted to stop her, but Song Luan waved her hand impatiently, \u201cWhat can happen on the way? If I don\u2019t walk around, my muscles and bones will be loose.\u201dThe maidservants thought for a while, the body of madam was better than before, and her face finally had a rosy color, so they didn\u2019t refuse again.It was not good to go to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study empty handed, so she carried two plates of pastries as she went.Zhao Nanyu seemed to have guests, but he had instructed the bodyguards outside the study not to stop her from going in.The study looked very bright, with the windows and lights open.In front of Zhao Nanyu stood a handsome young man with a cold jaw line. His face was tight and expressionless.He was dressed in black and had a sword pinned to his waist. It seemed that he was a military officer.There was also a scar in the center of his eyebrow, which was not deep nor shallow. The size of the scar equated to a length of a nail plate, which made him look fierce.The man raised his eyes and looked at her coldly, obviously disgusted.Song Luan pretended that she didn\u2019t see it. She couldn\u2019t count the people who hated her. Why bother about this extra person?She put the cake on his desk and laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a guest, if I did I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201dZhao Nanyu squeezed her hand. It was cold, and it seemed that he couldn\u2019t warm it enough. He then embraced her into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201dZhao Nanyu pulled her back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAnd he said to the man in front of him, \u201cLu Ji, you should have a cup of tea first.\u201dLu Ji was a little surprised. Even a military officer, who didn\u2019t listen too much of outside rumors, had heard of Song Luan\u2019s deeds.From the bottom of his heart, he hated women who didn\u2019t act in accordance to women\u2019s principles.In the recent years, Song Luan\u2019s arrogant and insolent attitude spread around the city. So, Lu Ji, thought to himself that when he came back to the capital, he had to restrain himself from killing her. Wow. His hatred is deep.Why does Mr. Zhao treat such woman so well? It\u2019s not worth it.Lu Ji guessed that it might be because of her beauty. She was thin and delicate, and her eyes seemed to be full of light, which made people feel pity for her.Song Luan knew the name of Lu Ji. He was the confidant of the male lead, and the commander of the imperial guards.Because his mother left her sick husband and eloped with another man, he had been lonely since childhood. This was also the reason why he hated Song Luan.Song Luan didn\u2019t want to stay here, nor being stared at by his disgusted look.\u201dYou let me go. \u201c\u201cCome on. Stay a little longer.\u201dZhao Nanyu refused to let go of her hand, so Song Luan had to stay. Her face was red with anger towards him. She looked very cute.Lu Ji glanced at her and silently withdrew his sight.Good figure, good color, no wonder Mr. Zhao liked her.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t like her being seen by outsiders, so he covered her face,Then he said to Lu Ji, \u201cGo back first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan was bored playing with his fingers. She looked over and around, opened and closed her arms, but she didn\u2019t think it was fun. It was just too boring.Although Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was cold, Song Luan knew that he was in a good mood.Zhao Nanyu laughed, \u201cZhao Chao\u2019s master is on his way back to the capital.\u201dHer poison would be solved.Song Luan yawned, and didn\u2019t hear him clearly, \u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201dZhao Nanyu said again with good temper.Song Luan had no hope of detoxification, but the surprise suddenly knocked her brain out.Would she be saved??? In the book, the original owner didn\u2019t drink the antidote until she died.At the same time, Song Luan was also a little worried. After all, the plots that happened before, no matter how she tried, anything related to her would not change.She was afraid it would be the same this time.Thinking of this, Song Luan couldn\u2019t help hugging Zhao Nanyu, \u201cI\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201dShe certainly didn\u2019t want to die. If she could live long, that would be good.At night, Zhao Nanyu hugged her as he slept. At first, Song Luan was not very willing to sleep being embraced by him, but later, she found that sleeping in his arms was comfortable, which made her compromise.She arched uneasily in his arms for two times to find the most comfortable posture, and then closed her eyes.After a while, Song Luan opened her eyes, because she had a stomach ache. Her face turned pale, cold sweat came out of her back, and her facial features were slightly distorted.Zhao Nanyu soon noticed her slight change and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dSong Luan whimpered, her voice came out of her throat, as she stuttered, \u201cI\u2026I\u2026feel uncomfortable. My stomach hurts.\u201dIt\u2019s not a stomach ache. She didn\u2019t know which part of her body was being attacked.She grabbed Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sleeve, as if he was a painkiller.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s warm palm covered her stomach, \u201cIs it here?\u201dSong Luan shook her head and gasped, \u201cNo.\u201dHis hand moved up. \u201cHere?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes were red. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the pain is\u2026\u201dZhao Nanyu, with a pale face, had to hold her and rub her stomach gently.After an hour of incense, Song Luan\u2019s pain gradually stopped. She fell into his arms feebly, and her hair was wet with sweat.Zhao Nanyu pinched her waist, his eyes flashed with pain, and the shadow in his heart deepened.When she met his terrifying eyes, she couldn\u2019t help but shrink back.Looking at it from this angle, his eyes were even more grim.He pinched her neck gently, bent his head, and bit her white lips, as he murmured, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dBut it\u2019s a false repentance.Not enough to tolerate Song Luan leaving him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MarySong Luan was waiting for the legendary doctor.She was not a pessimist, but this time she only had little expectations in her heart. Which was also not too bad. If there was no good result in the end, she could bear it calmly.In the past few months, the relationship between her and Zhao Nanyu began to clear up. Maybe because there was nothing to do, but as long as the weather was fine, she would wander to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study, even reaching to the point of watching him write.Song Luan went to find him that day, and there was no one guarding outside.Standing in the distance, she could hear a terrible cry coming from inside. The sorrow was extremely desperate, and she could feel its hoarse and broken voice.Song Luan slowed down and approached the door. Looking through the slit, she saw a half dead man lying on the ground. Zhao Nanyu held one end of the whip in his hand. His clothes were stained with blood. Not only that, but also his hands were dyed red with blood.His murderous spirit was raging and majestic.Zhao Nanyu, with his back to her, raised his foot and stepped on the man\u2019s wound mercilessly. Looking at him from above, he said, \u201cIf you hand it over, you don\u2019t have to suffer so much.\u201dThe man\u2019s face was twisted and his teeth clenched. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201dZhao Nanyu was not ready to waste any more words. The man had a tight mouth, and he couldn\u2019t pry anything out from him. Zhao Nanyu had been in Dali temple for several years, and was good at punishing people.This man had long been tortured by him, and wouldn\u2019t live any longer.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t mind sending him a ride. He could suppress the irritability in his heart even after seeing blood. He took the sword from his servants carelessly, and pierced his throat with a sword.Song Luan\u2019s heart shook, and she hurriedly took a deep breath to stabilize her body. She was about to pretend that she hadn\u2019t seen anything, but when she was about to leave quietly, Zhao Nanyu suddenly turned his head, as if discovering there was someone.Zhao Nanyu raised his hand and the door in front of Song Luan was opened.His face was also splashed with bloodstains, and the spirit of killing was rampant. Zhao Nanyu was only slightly surprised to see that it was her. After calming down, he handed the sword in his hand to the person on his side. He slowly wiped the blood on his hands with a handkerchief, and walked up to her and sighed, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t make a sound?\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want her to see this bloody scene, she was already afraid of him. However, it didn\u2019t matter if she saw it. Sooner or later, Song Luan would have to find out that he was not a good man.He already had the weight of a lot of human lives in his hands. He didn\u2019t think it was anything important.Song Luan felt nauseous, and wanted to vomit. Subconsciously, she avoided his hands as she turned pale.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes dimmed.She was terrified.Zhao Chao\u2019s master just arrived at the gate of the capital, and was respectfully invited by Zhao Nanyu.Xu Daozi was wearing a black taoist robe with a duster in his hand. His face was kind, and his smile was shallow. If people ignored his clothes, he could pass as a very kind old man.After traveling abroad for more than a year, Xu Daozi knew nothing about the situation in the capital. He never inquired or asked. His only apprentice couldn\u2019t find him, and Xu Daozi never disclosed his whereabouts.He thought it was his uneasy apprentice who wanted to see him. When he entered the gate of Zhao\u2019s mansion, he found out that it was someone else.At the moment, Song Luan also looked at the smiling old man with white beard. Zhao Nanyu solemnly said to Xu Daozi, \u201cPlease, taoist priest.\u201dXu Daozi examined her pulse, and his pupils opened slightly. He was surprised and said, \u201cTianqing?\u201dZhao Nanyu tightened his jaw, and his face was frozen, \u201cHmm. That\u2019s right.\u201dAs he began to pack up his things, he shook his head and said, \u201cNot good.\u201dTianqing was originally a poison made by him on a whim. He had a strange temper. After living for several decades, he had produced a few poisons, but there was no antidote for any of them.Even he couldn\u2019t find the solution himself.Tianqing was made in a hurry at that time. Xu Daozi was very satisfied with the poison. Its toxicity was abnormal enough to be comparable to sulfur, but it was different from sulfur.Tianqing would slowly corrode the organs in the body, causing pain for two or three years before death.When the viscera were hollowed out, people would naturally not live.Looking at the pale girl in front of him, he felt a little pity for her. It seemed that the little girl was still young, her face was crisp and her eyes were clean like a pool of spring water. She was very beautiful.It was a pity that such a person would die.Xu Daozi slowly turned his eyes to Zhao Chao on his side, raised his hand, and slapped him on the forehead without mercy. \u201cExplain to me what\u2019s going on?!\u201dHow could such a poisonous medicine be used on a girl who hadn\u2019t the strength even to bind a chicken?\u201cMaster, we will talk about it later.\u201d\u201cStay here, taoist priest.\u201d Zhao Nanyu stopped him.Xu Daozi was not a patient person. He was very tired from travelling.His apprentice said that he wanted to bring him here, and didn\u2019t even give him face.He felt so bad tempered that he went straight to him and said, \u201cI know what you want to ask. There is no cure. At most, she can live for two or three months.\u201dIf she could bear the waves of pain, this poisoned little girl could still live for three years, but her delicate appearance didn\u2019t seem to be able to survive that long.Most of the people who had been hit by tianqing would eventually commit suicide. No one could stand the pain day after day. And that kind of heart piercing pain would increase slowly but surely, until even breathing would become a kind of torture.Song Luan accepted the news calmly, but her tears still fell without any warning. Xu Daozi saw the little girl crying, and he coughed unnaturally.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s fingers in his sleeve were tightly clenched together. His knuckles turned white and his thin lips moved. He couldn\u2019t make any noise for a long time.Song Luan wiped her tears. She thought that this was the fate of the original owner, even if she was a transmigrator, even if she knew in advance, the plot still couldn\u2019t be changed.There was nothing to do.Song Luan admitted that she was afraid of death, but it was not impossible for her to face this calmly. Maybe she would go back if she died in this world.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Song Luan was relieved by Zhao Nanyu\u2019s pitiful and pained eyes.Xu Daozi softened his heart, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, little girl. It\u2019s not only two or three months, it could also reach two years. You should take good advantage of it.\u201dTwo years, exactly the same time as the original owner.What were the days of those two years, Song Luan had seen the description of the text with her own eyes.Zhao Nanyu refused to believe a word that came out of Xu Daozi\u2019s mouth.He still went everywhere to find a doctor for her, and put up a notice offering a reward. Song Luan only smiled when she learned of it. She was not discouraged. She did not feel that Zhao Nanyu was doing useless work. Since she was not dead yet, she would not give up easily.It\u2019s a pity that after drinking too much medicine, the effect would not be as good as before.All the warlocks and imperial doctors were helpless, just as Xu Daozi said.Zhao Nanyu was too listless to pretend to be warm and pleasant, and his temper was getting worse.Song Luan knew that he had thrown a lot of angry tantrums behind her back. His eyes wouldn\u2019t bend anymore, and the number of times he laughed became less.He would only smile when the two of them were together.Every day, he would bring some trinkets from outside to make her happy.Song Luan slept less and less, and the faint pain in her body made it difficult for her to fall asleep.She hugged Zhao Nanyu\u2019s waist tightly, and sniffed the familiar scent on him, which made her feel more comfortable.Every time she slept, she would always dream about Zhao Nanyu ruthlessly plunging her heart with a knife.She had a premonition that this picture in her dream would come true one day. Zhao Nanyu would kill her in the end. What was the reason? She couldn\u2019t guess now.The dagger was placed in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s study in the upper right corner of his desk.Zhao Nanyu saw that she was unhappy, so he invited her mother to come over. It was good to make her happy.Aunt Lin looked at her daughter\u2019s poor and emaciated appearance. She cried straight out, wiping her tears and scolding Zhao Nanyu. Her mean words were, \u201cThat cheap one! He dares to torture you like this. If it wasn\u2019t for your father\u2019s disapproval, I would have taken you back. What do we want from the Zhao family? Zhao Nanyu haspower, otherwise I would have killed him.\u201dAunt Lin spoke indignantly about Zhao Nanyu.Song Luan held her mother\u2019s hand and said in a soft voice, \u201cMother, I\u2019m hungry. Did you bring some delicious food?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Zhao Nanyu was really not good. I\u2019ve only been eating light food recently, and I need some oil in my mouth.\u201dAunt Lin said uneasily, \u201cYou are ill. It\u2019s good for you to eat light food.\u201dShe sighed and looked at Song Luan with loving eyes. \u201cWhat a wonderful daughter I have, how could she be tortured like this in the Zhao family?!\u201dAt the beginning, she would rather send her daughter to a nunnery, than make her marry Zhao Nanyu.Song Luan didn\u2019t know how to persuade her. Aunt Lin really loved her, and her eyes were swollen.She sighed in her heart, a little guilty. \u201cMother, let\u2019s not talk about those unhappy things. I\u2019ll tell you, yesterday, Zhao Nanyu got me a snow-white cat from nowhere, but the cat didn\u2019t seem to like me very much, so the cat ran away secretly.\u201dAt this point, she chuckled, \u201cZhao Nanyu looked for it in the middle of the night, but he couldn\u2019t find it.\u201dAunt Lin said, \u201cYou\u2019re too careless.\u201dShe still had the leisure time to take care of a cat.But aunt Lin was worried. Her daughter was thin, and her complexion was not good. Her body smelled of medicine, as if she had just been released from a medicine jar.Recalling her daughter\u2019s bright and beautiful appearance before, aunt Lin was very sad, and scolded Zhao Nanyu!Aunt Lin scolded Zhao Nanyu from the beginning to the end. To sum it up, this man was not a good thing.Song Luan covered her mouth and laughed secretly. As soon as she did, she felt pain in her back. She had no choice but to endure it, so she held her waist, and said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cGood, good, I will stop.\u201dAunt Lin accompanied her for an afternoon and told her everything that happened in the Song residence. For example, the fifth sister had just entered the harem. The queen dowager picked her into the palace herself.It seems that she was quite favored by the new emperor.Her brother Song Heqing took in concubine which provoked the relationship between her brother and sister-in-law.Song Luan\u2019s brain ached.She remembered the fate of Ayun, and she hadn\u2019t seen her for a long time. The new emperor was a typical cold hearted ruler in the original book.Song Luan was eating melon seeds and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with my brother taking a concubine?\u201dAunt Lin frowned. \u201cThat girl was the daughter of a condemned minister. Your brother saved her because of their old love. Who knows what will happen later?\u201d\u201cSister-in-law must be very sad.\u201dImagine if Zhao Nanyu took a concubine, she would also be very sad, thinking about this kind of thing made her heart a little sour.\u201cNo! she cried several times behind your brother\u2019s back, but she didn\u2019t dare to let anyone know. Your sister-in-law is too soft and is being bullied in silence.\u201dAunt Lin\u2019s tone suddenly sharpened. \u201cIf anyone dares to stand against me, I\u2019ll kill her with a knife.\u201dBut aunt Lin was very happy in the Song residence.Song Luan could only listen. Aunt Lin was not Song Heqing\u2019s biological mother. It was even more difficult for her to take care of his house affairs.Aunt Lin didn\u2019t stay for dinner, and she said she didn\u2019t want to see Zhao Nanyu, because she was annoyed whenever she saw him.***The gauze lamp was emitting warm light, but Song Luan didn\u2019t think it was bright enough.She got out of bed and lit two lamps, which made the room brighter.It was a very difficult night to fall asleep. Zhao Nanyu laid on her side with one hand around her shoulder. His voice was very pleasant and his face was gentle. He tried to tell her jokes.Song Luan\u2019s back and abdomen ached. She looked at him with watery eyes, as she listened to him attentively. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s jokes were really not funny, but Song Luan laughed at his hard work, and serious attempts to make her happy.It was better not to laugh, because whenever she did, her chest began to hurt.She covered her chest, took a deep breath, and complained in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me jokes. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll die without a breath.\u201dZhao Nanyu squeezed her shoulders. He hated to hear her say this kind of thing.Song Luan leaned against his arms with her eyes closed, and said slowly, \u201cI am very happy that my mother came to see me today.\u201dNo need for him to coax her.She was easy to coax, and was easy to satisfy.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s words became less, and his voice became worse. He probably had a hard time during this period.Song Luan slept every day. She woke up whenever her body was in constant pain.When she was unconscious, there was always a voice in her ear saying, \u201cIf he kills you, you will be free.\u201dShe was tired of listening to it.When she woke up, she still clearly remembered the sentence. Death was a kind of liberation.She walked barefoot. Nothing in the room was not covered with expensive carpets. When she stepped on it, it was not cold at all. She slowly walked to the window, her eyes not knowing where to fall.(T/N: Paragraphs with brackets below are the events that happened in the book. In this case, it\u2019s the memory of when Zhao Nanyu was still a child.)[The young boy was tightly held in his arms by his mother. The woman\u2019s face was blue, her whole body was cold as it gradually stiffened, but she still did not forget to protect her child. The cold wind and rain hit her face. She shook her hand and handed the jade pendant to the young boy\u2019s palm. \u201cAh Yu, you must live well.\u201d][The boy had a very beautiful face. Even in his shabby clothes, his cold temperament couldn\u2019t be blocked. The man with sharp lips and sharp cheeks kicked him away, \u201cDo you really regard yourself as a young master? Even if you are recognized, it would just be evil.][Zhao Nanyu! What are you?! Do you deserve to touch me?!]Song Luan remembered the description of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s desolate past in the book. Was he pitiful?Pitiful.Song Luan suddenly felt like she had always been too persistent. If she could accept the plot arranged in the original book, then she would die very well.The pain in her chest became more and more acute. Xu Daozi didn\u2019t lie to her. She could live two or three months at most. Even if she didn\u2019t die, she wouldn\u2019t be able to stab herself.Zhao Nanyu opened the door and saw the woman curled up against the window. His eyebrows wrinkled as he held her up. Song Luan opened her tired eyes, and she said softly, \u201cZhao Nanyu, I know the poison in my body came from you.\u201dThe man\u2019s body suddenly froze, and there were thin bloodstains in his eyes. His eyes seemed to look redder than before.Song Luan stared at him intently, lifted her hand, and pulled out the hairpin on her head. She placed it in his palm, and said with a smile, \u201cYou can give me salvation from this poison.\u201dIt took less than a month for the poison to show serious symptoms. She had already suffered enough.Whether she was awake or asleep, she was in pain.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes in that moment became very vicious, almost ferocious.T/N: That escalated so fast\u2026well, no, since the author weaved it so intricately that we already know what we\u2019re expecting. \u1566(\u00f2_\u00f3\u02c7)\u1564 stay strong, readers~!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MaryZhao Nanyu squeezed the hairpin she had handed to him. The other end of the silver hairpin was sharp, and it was easy to pierce a person\u2019s throat with it. In a low voice, he asked, \u201cWhen did you discover it?\u201dSong Luan slowly said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for me to guess.\u201d She smiled, and looked relaxed, \u201cI\u2019m too uncomfortable. Please help me.\u201dZhao Nanyu hugged her tighter, refusing to let her go from his arms. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dAs expected, Song Luan had long guessed that he would not agree, she only sighed and said nothing.She had other plans, but Zhao Nanyu seemed to know all her thoughts since long ago. All the sharp objects around Song Luan were put away, not giving her any chance to die.In fact, Song Luan was very timid and afraid of pain. She didn\u2019t have enough courage to commit suicide. However, the pain in her heart made her toss and turn, and there wasn\u2019t a moment where she was comfortable. The desire for relief gave her the courage to die.She rummaged through all corners of the cabinet, but could not find anything that could be used to kill herself. Song Luan sat on the ground with disheveled hair and a dispirited expression.When Zhao Nanyu came in, she took the initiative to put her hand around his neck, gave him a kiss on his face, and said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you love me? I\u2019m begging you.\u201dZhao Nanyu was indifferent, carried her back to bed, and covered her with a quilt. He looked at her eyes and asked, \u201cWhat would you like to eat tonight?\u201dSong Luan was like a disinflated balloon. In the past two days, Zhao Nanyu deliberately refused to talk about it. She kicked aside the quilt and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat. I\u2019ll starve to death.\u201dStarvation was also a way to die, but it was not very respectable.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to eat roast duck last time? Let\u2019s eat this tonight.\u201dWhile touching her hair, he said, \u201cBut you can\u2019t eat it when it\u2019s too hot, or you will not be able to stand it.\u201dSong Luan swallowed very hopelessly.***As Zhao Nanyu tried everything possible, Song Luan\u2019s body did not see a slight improvement, and it decayed more and more. She could not sleep without relying on the tranquilizing soup, but if she drank the medicine, she often could not wake up easily.Once, Song Luan had slept for a full day and had not woken up. At that time, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was extremely ugly. He shook her hand and probed her nose. Fortunately, she still had a faint breath.After this happened, he wouldn\u2019t let Song Luan drink tranquilizing soup.Zhao Chao sent medicine to relieve the pain. For the first time, Song Luan was surprised to find that it didn\u2019t hurt much.But Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to be very happy either. This medicine couldn\u2019t cure it at all, and its effectiveness was limited. If it was used too much, it would gradually not work, and the power of the side effect was also great.***As spring was about to pass, Zhao Wenyan\u2019s wedding date arrived as promised.Song Luan ordered someone to dress her up, especially putting on beautiful new clothes. The delicate makeup covered her tired face. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want her to join in the event, but Song Luan refused. She was rarely so happy, so he turned a blind eye.Zhao\u2019s residence had not been so lively for a long time. Many guests came to the wedding day.After the ceremony, the bride was led to the bridal chamber.Song Luan knew some people among them, and she counted them with her fingers.Zhao Nanyu, Zhao Wenyan\u2019s elder brother, naturally couldn\u2019t walk away. He was busy dealing with all the people.Zhao Wenyan in red wedding clothes looked very decent. His lines were softer, and there was shallow joy in the tip of his eyes.He took both the gold title in the imperial list, and the bridal chamber candle. Naturally, he was happy.After watching the excitement for a while, Song Luan felt tired, and even yawned twice. The third lady Zhao said to her, \u201cAre you tired? Go back and rest. It\u2019s enough to have me here.\u201dSong Luan held up her eyelids, shook her head, and said, \u201cI can still hold on. I haven\u2019t seen the bridal chamber yet. I\u2019ll wait.\u201dThird lady Zhao couldn\u2019t laugh nor cry, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about the bridal chamber?\u201dThird lady Zhao\u2019s face was stiff from smiling all day on her son\u2019s wedding day. She had to meet every guest with a smile.Song Luan\u2019s eyes were full of laughter. \u201cI just thought it\u2019s fun.\u201dThird lady Zhao let Song Luan sit on the couch, and ordered her servant girl to carry tea and water. Zhao Nanyu entrusted Song Luan to her on this day, she certainly wouldn\u2019t let her have an accident.As she fanned her, she said, \u201cI told them in advance that we should not make too much trouble this year. I remember the year when you and Ah Yu got married, there was a lot of trouble. \u201cAt first, only a very few people knew about Song Luan\u2019s marriage to Zhao Nanyu, and at that time, their cousins and brothers were in cahoots, and made trouble.(T/N: The italicized paragraph below was the event of Song Luan and Zhao Nanyu\u2019s wedding. I just felt I needed to do a quick note since I was confused at this time when translating. I thought it was Zhao Wenyan\u2019s wedding event.)Several ignorant teenagers stood by the door, listening carefully.There was no sound in the room, and they began to whisper, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cMy cousin doesn\u2019t know what to do in his wedding night, and he can\u2019t talk sweet nothings at night, right?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I have seen the appearance of sister-in-law with my own eyes. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that she is a fairy in the sky. She is very beautiful.\u201dAfter waiting for a while, they still didn\u2019t hear anything. There was a courageous suggestion, \u201cLet\u2019s knock open the door and have a look? Give them a fright!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to die, in case they have\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be that there is no sound at all?\u201dSeveral pairs of black eyes looked at it, and finally nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll count down\u2013three, two, one!\u201dA group of young people burst open the door of the new house, and a group of people giggled as they raised their eyes to see two people sitting on the side of the room. They didn\u2019t look nor paid attention to each other.Their cousin was sitting at the desk by the window, writing with a brush in his hand, and no one knew what he was writing.The new sister-in-law had already changed her wedding dress. She was dressed in scarlet clothes and sat at the round table with her back straight and upright. When she saw them, she still did not change her face and continued to eat.The teenagers found that the new sister-in-law seemed to be a cold beauty. She refused to smile, and her cold eyes were comparable to their cousin\u2019s.The young and ignorant young man said, \u201cCousin, how can you be so far away from sister-in-law! If we don\u2019t see what we want to see, we won\u2019t leave tonight.\u201dZhao Nanyu frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble.\u201d\u201cWell, we can\u2019t do that. We won\u2019t let you do it easily today.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyebrows twisted deeper. After careful thinking, he felt helpless, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dIt\u2019s not that the teenagers were unaware of the strange atmosphere in the room. Several people didn\u2019t dare to make too much noise. \u201cWe want to see cousin drink wine with sister-in-law!\u201dZhao Nanyu walked to Song Luan with a cold face, and sat down slowly. He filled two glasses of wine with his own hands, and said in a low voice, \u201cCome on.\u201dSong Luan endured the anger and drank the wine with him.\u201cI\u2019ve drunk the wine, but how come I still have to kiss you!\u201dWith a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, Song Luan threw the empty wine cup on the table and sneered. She was quite dissatisfied.\u201cAll right, stop it and get out.\u201d Zhao Nanyu said lightly.The crowd retreated from the room. After closing the door, they heard the quarrel in the room.\u201cZhao Nanyu, what do you mean?! Are you trying to humiliate me!?\u201dSong Luan listened to third lady Zhao and smiled twice. It turned out that this happened when they got married.\u201cGirls should be thin skinned. They really can\u2019t be too aggressive.\u201d\u201cWell, my daughter-in-law is also timid and obedient. As long as she has Ah Yan in her heart, and can treat him well, then the stone in my heart will be lifted.\u201dSong Luan failed to see the bridal chamber as she wanted, because Zhao Nanyu went out from the hall and looked for her. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Go back and have a rest.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so cold and heartless. I\u2019ll go back when I have enough fun.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSong Luan stomped her feet angrily. She was sleepy a while ago and had to endure it, but now that she was not sleepy anymore, Zhao Nanyu had to come and take her back.It\u2019s annoying.\u201cI won\u2019t go. If you have the ability, you carry me back.\u201d Zhao Nanyu did not say much. He took her leg, lifted her to his shoulder, and forcibly carried her back to the residence.Song Luan complained, \u201cYou are so rude! I hate it.\u201dZhao Nanyu held her down nonchalantly, \u201cWell, I\u2019m rude.\u201dSong Luan grabbed a handful of his hair and said angrily, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the appearance of the bride yet.\u201dThe bride was hidden under the red veil, and she couldn\u2019t see anything.Zhao Nanyu squatted in front of her, took off her shoes and socks. \u201cYou can see her tomorrow.\u201dThe new daughter-in-law would come to greet them.Song Luan was blocked up by him.After drinking medicine, she rolled up her quilt and turned her back to him. He did not feel tired at all, but soon fell into a deep sleep.The next day, the bride came to offer tea.Zhao Wenyan\u2019s wife was also beautiful. She was a beautiful girl with bright eyes and bright teeth.The little girl timidly called her second sister-in-law, as she handed the big red bag she prepared in advance.Third lady Zhao coughed twice and asked, \u201cWere you tired last night?\u201dThe little girl blushed and said, \u201cNo..no.\u201dAnd she quickly explained \u201cMy husband was very understanding with me.\u201dShe was so young that she had just reached the maturity age.Ruan Sheng looked at Song Luan carefully. The second sister-in-law deserved her reputation. She was really beautiful.Song Luan was also aware of her gaze. She was caught off guard and laughed at her mischievously. \u201cI know I\u2019m beautiful, you\u2019ll have to stare at me all the time.\u201dRuan Sheng was caught on the spot and blushed.Song Luan thought that this sister-in-law was really lovely. Who didn\u2019t like cute girls? No wonder Zhao Wenyan, who had both a bad temper and arrogant personality, couldn\u2019t help but like her.***Song Luan got along well with Ruan Sheng. It seemed that Ruan Sheng also liked her a lot, since she often went to her room to talk with her. She was in a good mood.But Zhao Chao\u2019s painkillers have begun to fail. The pain in the chest only subsided in less than half a month, and then it returned. This time the pain was a hundred times worse than before.Song Luan couldn\u2019t get out of bed anymore. Zhao Nanyu also did not allow others to see her. He stood alone in front of her bed and wiped her sweat with a handkerchief.She couldn\u2019t sleep all night, and living became a kind of torment, just like the picture she had dreamt of\u2013the woman lying in bed became her.When Ruan Sheng finally came to see her, Song Luan looked pale and seemed to be about to fall down any time. She leaned against the pillow and talked to her with great effort.As long as she exerted strength, it would only hurt more.Her eyes were moist. \u201cSheng Sheng, would you do me a favor?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cNext time you come, bring me a knife, okay?\u201d Zhao Nanyu refused to kill her, but she didn\u2019t want to continue to suffer.Ruan Sheng shook her head in tears.Song Luan pulled out an ugly smile and said, \u201cLook at me now, it\u2019s more painful to live. I don\u2019t want to lie to you. I want this knife so I can die.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t agree.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to embarrass Ruan Sheng, but there was no way.Ruan Sheng was in a dilemma. She didn\u2019t know what to do.Zhao Nanyu walked in at this moment. Without even looking at Ruan Sheng, he directly told her to get out.Song Luan regretted that she would never see Ruan Sheng anymore.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with her.\u201d\u201cIf she does bring you a knife, I will kill her myself.\u201dShe knew that Zhao Nanyu would do it once he said it.Song Luan was in extreme pain at night.She opened her mouth and bit his flesh fiercely. There were several teeth marks left on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s wrist. He was a monster who was not afraid of being bitten.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t. You let me die.\u201d Song Luan was sweating with pain and staring at him with red eyes. Her words were extremely hurtful. \u201cI hate you. Why should I bear this? You can just simply give me relief!\u201dZhao Nanyu gave her medicine, so Song Luan was able to have a good sleep.His heart was already numbed with pain.Song Luan was getting thinner and thinner. She couldn\u2019t eat much food these days.Now it was useless to give her a knife because she had lost the strength to commit suicide.She leaned in Zhao Nanyu\u2019s arms, and wondered in anger, \u201cZhao Nanyu, please feel sorry for me. It\u2019s better for me to die than to live like this. Can\u2019t you take it as a good thing?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like me? Are you lying to me? Are you willing to see the person you love suffer from this kind of torture?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t want to cry. She couldn\u2019t control her tears, and they kept pouring out.She raised her neck and dropped a soft kiss on his lips. \u201cWell, okay?\u201d\u201cYou poisoned me. What do you regret?! Isn\u2019t it okay to kill me?\u201dZhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t breathe, his brain was dull and his eyes were sour. He couldn\u2019t say a word.After saying these words, Song Luan fell into a coma from pain. It was dusk when she woke up again. Zhao Nanyu led little Zhao\u2019s hand and walked in.Song Luan\u2019s heart relaxed at the moment. She knew that Zhao Nanyu had decided to let her go.Zhao Nanyu let go of little Zhao\u2019s hands, and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cGo and talk to your mother.\u201dLittle Zhao\u2019s eyes were red and swollen. It seemed that he had already cried. Song Luan held him and said, \u201cYou grew tall again.\u201dLittle Zhao wanted to be held by her, but he dared not touch her. His black and white eyes obstinately stared at his mother, for fear that once he closed his eyes, he would never see his mother again.Song Luan\u2019s only comfort was probably her son.\u201cYou should study hard. Don\u2019t ignore people in the future. Don\u2019t act like your father because your face won\u2019t be cute at all.\u201d\u201cMother.\u201d\u201cAlthough I want you to study hard, I don\u2019t want you to turn into a bookworm. You still need to make some playmates. Little Zhao is so lovely that many people will like you.\u201d Song Luan said slowly.When he cried, Song Luan wiped his tears with her sleeves. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Your mother likes you best.\u201dShe did not have the spirit to continue to talk anymore. Zhao Nanyu called grandma Lin to carry little Zhao out.The moment the door closed, all the remaining light disappeared.Zhao Nanyu walked forward two steps. He held Song Luan\u2019s back and helped her up.Song Luan leaned lazily against his chest, looking relaxed and serene.The man took out a dagger from his sleeve, held the handle as he trembled slightly.Song Luan closed her eyes lightly, and her breath was weak. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201dAs she had dreamt countless times, Zhao Nanyu would stab her heart. The plot never spared her even a little bit.In a trance, Song Luan felt that there were crystal drops falling on her cheek.His tears slipped past as the warm light reflected on his white face.His arms hugged her so tightly that it could almost suffocate her. He sighed silently, \u201cIt will be alright soon.\u201dT/N: This is heart-wrenching\u2026it is wonderfully written that I am convinced that I should translate more of this author\u2019s stories.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MaryThe sharp point of a knife aimed at her heart. As long as it was pierced in, Song Luan would be killed on the spot.Zhao Nanyu tremblingly held the hilt of the knife. His forehead was sweating, his voice was extremely low and hoarse, as he breathlessly said, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201dThe dagger fell to the ground with a \u2018dang\u2019.Song Luan held up the last bit of her strength to bend down to pick up the dagger on the ground. With such a simple action, she was sweating with pain. She gently put the dagger in his palm and said, \u201cIt\u2019s painful. It\u2019s painful even when I\u2019m sleeping.\u201dAll this time, she wanted to die. Her organs were decaying, her chest felt like there was a big hand pressing down on her, her heart was being clenched tightly, and everything inside her was stirring wildly.Even breathing was a heavy pain.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s tears fell on her cheek, Song Luan suddenly realized that her death was a relief for her, but a torture for Zhao Nanyu.It must be hard to kill someone you yourself love.But she really couldn\u2019t care about his mood anymore.She raised her chin and looked at Zhao Nanyu with red tearful eyes. She covered her chest with one hand, curled up and breathed heavily. \u201cIt really hurts. Please save me.\u201dThe sharp tingling spread from the soles of her feet and to her brain, her limbs and bones, and every place couldn\u2019t avoid this sharp and extreme pain.Song Luan screamed indiscriminately. Due to the loss of strength, her groaning was lower than her usual tone, and her original beautiful facial features were gradually distorted as it turned bloodless.Five pale fingers grabbed Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sleeve, \u201cKill me\u2026.please kill me.\u201dZhao Nanyu gently kissed her eyebrows, then he slowly closed his eyes, and opened them right after.He clenched the dagger tightly, his eyes were numb, and with a \u2018hissing\u2019 sound, the tip of the knife plunged into her flesh, and it directly pierced her heart.Song Luan fell into his arms, the corners of her lips showed a satisfied smile.It was almost exactly the same as the picture she had seen in her dream. She died in his arms by his hands.Zhao Nanyu pressed her head on his shoulder, while he hoarsely whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s alright..it\u2019s alright. It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, don\u2019t cry.\u201d\u201cOkay, you won\u2019t feel anymore pain, right?\u201dAt the moment when she was stabbed to death, Song Luan\u2019s soul seemed to be pulled violently, and pictures of memories came together all at once.Song Luan remembered a lot of things, like how she was very self-willed. Zhao Nanyu said more than many times that she liked to walk on the ground barefoot, but she had never heard of it. Every time, he would shake his head helplessly while chuckling, then would grab her foot, lower his body, and put on the shoes for her.In the winter, the snow in the capital was so heavy, and the weather was colder than usual. Zhao Nanyu made her a big snowman. At that time, she didn\u2019t have time to ask how long it took him.He must have suffered in the cold to make such a big snowman like that.This man had been tolerating her small temperament, and her arrogance. He is taciturn, domineering, and tolerant.Song Luan hadn\u2019t felt relaxed for a long time. Her soul was floating in the air. Many memories that do not belong to her were all in her mind.Suddenly, her soul was pulled out of the world.***Song Luan opened her eyes again. She was lying in front of her desk. The light in front of the computer was on. The computer page was still in the interface of the book \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019. It showed that the book was finished.She was in a trance for a moment, no\u2026the book was clearly not over yet. She shook her hand and opened the book.She read chapter by chapter, and her heart sank. The book was written almost according to everything she had experienced.The end was when she died.The comments at the bottom of the book exploded.[The author is an absolute idiot to write this book.][Author, your mother is dead, do you hear me?!!][Now I want to transport myself back before I opened this book a few hours ago, and strangle myself..wuwuwuwu][What I did so wrong to be tortured like this.][Oh wow\u2026that is so sweet]Song Luan sat dumbfounded in front of the computer, looking blank and innocent. She let Zhao Nanyu stab her to death, and she didn\u2019t expect to come back.Everything she had experienced was like a dream\u2013so unreal.Song Luan touched the jade pendant on her neck and was stunned for a long time. This was the jade pendant Zhao Nanyu forced her to wear. It turned out that it was all real.She felt empty, and a little uncomfortable.Song Luan turned off the computer, threw herself on the bed, and looked at the ceiling with her big eyes open. She didn\u2019t fall asleep the whole night, only when the dawn arrived did she fall asleep.She couldn\u2019t tell where she was. Once again, she saw the woman who had been killed by an arrow on the tower, but this time she was wearing a gorgeous wedding dress and a pretty smile on her face. She seemed to be very happy.The man in white was holding her hand and pressed close to her ear. No one knew what he said to her. The woman in the wedding dress had crooked eyes and was coquettish with laughter, and later reached out to playfully beat him.Song Luan tried hard to see the man\u2019s face, but his face was blurred. She couldn\u2019t see it clearly.Song Luan seemed to be trapped in this fantasy again, almost unable to wake up. It was only when the mobile phone rang that she woke up. Song Luan opened her tired eyes, went to the bathroom to brush her teeth, washed her face, and muttered incoherent words in hunger.She put on her shoes and planned to go out, only to find out that she was wearing pajamas. She changed her pajamas in a trance and went out with her purse.Just as Song Luan walked out of the gate of the community, a man in a taoist robe was sitting next to the sentry box, \u201cFortune-telling?\u201dHearing this voice, Song Luan subconsciously turned her head and looked past. Her pupils shrunk suddenly.He was the taoist priest who she once met in Fulu temple.The man raised his face and laughed at her. \u201cLady, get a divination.\u201dSong Luan rushed to him and squeezed her finger. \u201cWho are you?\u201dWho the hell was he?! Even if he knew more, why did he exist in both worlds?The taoist laughed. \u201cMy identity doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t help but stepped forward and grabbed his hand, fearing that he would disappear again like last time. \u201cYou know what\u2019s going on, right?\u201dWhy did she transmigrate in the book? Why did the content of \u2018The Powerful Minister\u2019 change after she came back? Was it a dream of hers?The taoist priest gently brushed her hand away. There was no emotion on his young face. He raised his eyebrows, and was slightly surprised. \u201cIt seems that you haven\u2019t remembered.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dThe taoist thought, \u201cLet me tell you a story.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear stories! I just want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe young taoist wanted to tell her a long story.An imperial decree tied the emperor\u2019s beloved little princess to the son of the southwest king.The little princess was unwilling to marry.Although the little princess was not happy to marry a man whom she had never met, she had heard of him, the youngest son of the southwest king.He was a well-known general, capable of both literary and martial arts skills, and the most important was that he lived an excellent life.There were beautiful women of all nationalities who wanted to marry him in the southwest border town.On the wedding night, the little princess sat uneasily on the wedding bed, stirring her handkerchief to relieve her inner tension. She waited for a long time for the slightly drunk bridegroom to arrive, and when he arrived, her red veil in front of her was slowly lifted away.The little princess saw a beautiful and elegant face, like a fairy in the sky, beautiful and majestic.She was stunned as she gazed at his beauty. The man laughed at her and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting.\u201dThe son was very polite, even on his wedding night. He didn\u2019t seem to like her very much. He talked to her as if he were dealing with guests, rather than as his wife.The innocent and romantic little princess was moved. She wandered in front of him all day long. Finally, one day, the noble son of the southwest king fell in love with her simplicity.The relationship between the husband and wife heated up rapidly.The little princess was still too silly, she was fooled by the eldest son, and was then captured.In the third year of winter, the southwest king initiated a war, and his most promising youngest son became his aide against the capital.The two men worked together in and out, and the southwest king soon won over the capital.The guards of the capital had no choice but to retreat.The little princess was caught. Those desperate people took her as a last straw.They took her to the tower, and threatened the youngest prince with the life of his wife.The prince took the bow and arrow of the bodyguard behind him.He didn\u2019t even have a moment\u2019s hesitation, when the arrow feather flew directly over to her.Song Luan said coldly, \u201cI said I don\u2019t want to hear the story.\u201dShe didn\u2019t like the story at all, or any stories with tragedies.The taoist asked, \u201cDo you want to go back?\u201dShe didn\u2019t like Zhao Nanyu much, but she thought of how pitiful he was, and was afraid that he would go crazy.She also wanted to meet her brother, and her lovely child.\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to go back.\u201d He said meaningfully.As soon as the voice changed, he spoke again, \u201cLet\u2019s finish the story with you. The little princess made a poison oath before she died. She never ever wanted to meet him again. \u201cIf they meet again, she would never fall in love with him again.It\u2019s the curse of the little princess.If she still makes a fool of herself, and still falls in love with him, she would die.The taoist lazily looked at Song Luan\u2019s back. It was the third time that the man had killed her.He would never recognize the woman he loves, even if he lives again and finds her.He would live in torment, and alone.That person\u2019s obsession is too deep, even entangling a woman\u2019s lifetimes.A man whose obsession runs deep would be cursed forever.***Zhao Chao felt that Zhao Nanyu was crazy.Song Luan was already dead, but he didn\u2019t let anyone touch her body, and didn\u2019t even bury her. No one was allowed to enter the room.The Song family did not know about it until a few days later. Aunt Lin paid a lot of money to hire the people from the escort agency . Her mother hired them to escort Song Luan\u2019s corpse. She then called all the servants of the Song family to break into the Zhao residence.Zhao Nanyu was teaching little Zhao at this time. Except for his pale face, no one could see anything out of the ordinary.Aunt Lin\u2019s voice had been hoarse for a long time. Her eyes were red. She had to rely on the help of her maidservant to stand firm.She was always a woman with exquisite makeup, but after her daughter\u2019s death, her heart was now dead.She raised her hand and slapped Zhao Nanyu heavily. Her eyes were full of hate, as she gnashed her teeth. \u201cYou give my daughter back to me, even if it\u2019s her corpse, I won\u2019t leave it to you. She won\u2019t be allowed into your Zhao family\u2019s grave.\u201dHer poor daughter, how old even was she to lose her life?!At that time, she really shouldn\u2019t have been married to Zhao Nanyu, that fierce animal.\u201cYou can\u2019t take her away,\u201d Zhao Nanyu said brazenly.\u201cI\u2019m her mother! I tell you, Zhao Nanyu, my daughter married you for eight years. How could a good person die like this?! Hmm?! How many times did you hurt her!? Why do you still have the face to continue to hold on to her, pretending to be affectionate and diligent. I feel sick after watching it.\u201d Aunt Lin laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she will find it ridiculous when she sees it.\u201dZhao Nanyu turned a deaf ear as if all these words were not attacking him. He picked up little Zhao and covered his ears. \u201cYou are not allowed to listen.\u201dLittle Zhao buried his face in his neck, wanting to cry but couldn\u2019t.Zhao Nanyu looked at the distance with empty eyes, raised his right hand, and looked in the sun. That day, he killed his beloved woman with this hand.The sun shone on his shoulder, but Zhao Nanyu still felt very cold.The only thing she cared about in this world was their son. She loves this child, so he should take good care of him. Otherwise, she would blame him when she comes back in the future.Aunt Lin hated him very much. She pointed to the people she had brought, and yelled, \u201cGo and bring me my daughter\u2019s body.\u201dA group of people rushed in, and aunt Lin also broke into the room. Her daughter was lying in the middle of the bed with a quiet look. Her wounds and blood were wiped clean, and her lips were smeared with rouge.Zhao Nanyu approached her step by step. His guards surrounded Song Luan\u2019s body.He looked at Aunt Lin calmly and said, \u201cI said, you can\u2019t take her away. She is mine.\u201dAunt Lin took Song Luan\u2019s body in her arms, turned over her collar, saw the wound on her chest, and cried out loud, \u201cWhy did you do it!?\u201dZhao Nanyu gave a very shallow smile. He stepped forward, snatched the person back, and hugged her in his arms. He lowered his head like whispering to his lover, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for letting others disturb you.\u201dZhao Nanyu glanced at aunt Lin, \u201cYou disturbed her sleep.\u201dAunt Lin nearly fainted, as she shakily pointed with her hand. She almost couldn\u2019t breathe, \u201cYou are crazy. You are really crazy.\u201dEven in Ah Luan\u2019s death, he would not let her rest in peace.Zhao Chao couldn\u2019t bear to see it, and said in a voice, \u201cSecond brother, please let second sister-in-law rest in peace.\u201dZhao Nanyu gave him a look that became fierce and vicious, \u201cYou shut up.\u201d\u201cSecond brother, the corpse will stink and rot. She can\u2019t stay long. You might as well let her go.\u201dZhao Nanyu didn\u2019t listen to any of them, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to go away?\u201dNo one could disturb him and Song Luan\u2019s alone time.She just fell asleep, and would wake up soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerAunt Lin couldn\u2019t stand successive attacks and was finally carried back to the Song Residence.Rumors spread around in the capital. There were many people in restaurants and teahouses talking about him killing his wife. Their tone were both furious and afraid. There were differences in the rumors.Some people think that Zhao Nanyu was justified in killing his wife. After all, Song Luan didn\u2019t give him less green hats to humiliate him. A woman who didn\u2019t abide by women\u2019s principles, was considered vicious, and should be killed.Those who spoke for Song Luan were only a few. It was nothing more than criticizing Zhao Nanyu for his cruel methods. No matter how she was as his wife, why should she be killed? At any rate, she was a beautiful woman, and had also given birth to a son for him.He was so heartless that he did not recognize any old love with her.Moreover, if this kind of thing spreads out, no matter how excellent he was, where could they find a family to marry their daughters to him as his step-wife in the future?They didn\u2019t know how much Zhao Nanyu hated her dead wife that he ruined his future to this extent.Zhao Nanyu was favored by the new emperor. In just a few months, he eradicated dissidents, eliminated snobbery, and killed many people. Many people wanted to use this matter as a leverage against him.They did not lack courage. The civil servant, who was motivated by his situation, handed the book to the new emperor. The new emperor just looked at it with a smile and put it aside. He lazily wrote back a few words, \u201cI know.\u201dAt noon that day, Zhao Nanyu was called into the palace.A crowd of spectators were waiting to see the good play.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face was sickly white, and his lips were pale. The imperial suit looked big and empty on him.The new emperor pointed to the book on the table with a smile, and spoke to him like this matter was a joke, \u201cThese old men really want you to die. Also, what you did was too blatant.\u201dWith a smile, he said, \u201cThe reputation of having killed a wife is not good either now or in the previous dynasty.\u201dThe\u00a0new\u00a0emperor\u00a0remembered\u00a0that\u00a0Zhao\u00a0Nanyu\u00a0spent\u00a0so\u00a0many\u00a0months\u00a0with\u00a0his\u00a0wife\u00a0that\u00a0even\u00a0he\u00a0rarely\u00a0stayed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0palace\u00a0for\u00a0so\u00a0long.\u00a0The\u00a0new emperor\u00a0also\u00a0heard\u00a0that\u00a0Song\u00a0Luan\u00a0was\u00a0not in good health, as if she was gravely ill. After\u00a0seeing\u00a0so many\u00a0doctors,\u00a0it was\u00a0still\u00a0helpless.He patted Zhao Nanyu on the shoulder and sighed, \u201cYou have never been anxious. Why are you so reckless this time?\u201dWhy did he have to move his hand for Song Luan when he knew she didn\u2019t have enough days to live? If he didn\u2019t like her, he could just watch her die. The emperor couldn\u2019t understand this contradiction.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand was lightly resting on his heart. He seemed to be in pain. His appearance looked very weak, and his eyes were dark and empty. \u201cShe hurts too much. I can\u2019t bear to see her continue to suffer.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t sleep all night. She fainted in the middle of the night, and woke up with pain.Song Luan was even in tears in her dream.The new emperor was surprised, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that a good person like this fell sick.\u201dHis unintentionally words were like a sharp knife that accurately stabbed into Zhao Nanyu\u2019s heart.It wasn\u2019t someone else who wanted Song Luan to die.It was him when he wished for her death before.The new emperor had never seen Zhao Nanyu look so pathetic. He was so weak that he looked like he could fall anytime. He seemed too sad to speak, and his voice was so hoarse that the emperor couldn\u2019t understand what he said.The emperor didn\u2019t know how to comfort him. Originally, he wanted to remind him not to do too much. It\u2019s very easy to take a person\u2019s life. He just had to remember to keep a low profile. He couldn\u2019t make the whole capital know.But Zhao Nanyu was like this now, so he couldn\u2019t say anything more.The palace man bowed from the side hall, and whispered a few words in the emperor\u2019s ear. The emperor sneered a few times, and his face was cruel, \u201cShe won\u2019t eat it? Then don\u2019t give it to her for three days. If she is hungry, she will eat it naturally.\u201dThe palace man got the order and immediately withdrew.The emperor also had a lot of messy things to deal with. At this time, he was in a hot temper and full of anger. He asked, \u201cDo you want to drink?\u201dZhao Nanyu shook his head gently. \u201cI have to go back and teach my son his homework lessons.\u201dThe emperor pondered for a long time and said, \u201cOne day I will bring him in. I also like this child very much.\u201dIt\u2019s not him that liked the child.He just thought that Ayun would like him. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t get angry with him when she meets this little kid.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyelids did not move, \u201cThen you go to the Zhao residence to see him.\u201dZhao Nanyu was the only one in the world who dares to speak to him like this.***Song Luan\u2019s body was burned away by a fire. No one knew how the fire broke out in her residence. When people reacted, the fire was already strong and the beams of the house were all burnt.Their faces changed greatly, and they rushed to fetch water. The fire burn Song Luan\u2019s bedroom clean, and her body was burned to a pile of ashes.The servants looked at Zhao Nanyu. They didn\u2019t dare to breathe, in fear that they would be the one to die next.The timid servant girl sobbed in a low voice, her whole body was shaking uncontrollably, and her sobbing voice broke the silence.Zhao Nanyu turned and looked at her with dark eyes. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201dThe servant girl hiccuped as she wiped her tears. She couldn\u2019t say that she was scared of him, so she knelt down on her knees with a plop.He was too frightening at the moment, just like the devil who had just climbed out of hell.When he looked at them, it was especially terrifying.Zhao Nanyu blankly looked at the ruins in front of him, and his heart was full of wounds.He waved his hand and said, \u201cClean it up.\u201dSince then, no one in residence dared to mention Song Luan\u2019s name. Her name seems to have become a taboo.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to have changed much from before. Zhao Chao knew that his second brother\u2019s heart was dead, completely dead.That day, his second brother drank too much and asked for a tianqing poison.He said, \u201cI also want to taste what kind of pain it is?\u201dHe wanted to taste his own sins.Of course, Zhao Chao wouldn\u2019t give it to him, \u201cSecond brother, you still have little Zhao. What will he do if you\u2019re like this? He\u2019s only five years old this year.\u201dZhao Nanyu said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t die.\u201d He said hoarsely, \u201cShe will come back.\u201dNo one could take her away from him, no one could.After waking up, Zhao Nanyu recovered his cool and noble appearance again. His temperament was cold and hard, making others dared not go close to him.A month later, little Zhao got sick.The disease was more severe than ever before.Zhao Nanyu was worried about him. He stood by his bed and held the child in his arms. Under the candlelight, he did not turn his eyes away from looking at his son. In fact, the child\u2019s appearance was not like Song Luan.Only he could vaguely see her resemblance from him.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes were sour. She liked to look at him with innocent eyes, and shook his sleeves every time she wanted to act coquettish.Little Zhao\u2019s mouth sob a few words, but Zhao Nanyu did not hear clearly.Zhao Nanyu knew that the child depended on his mother. He was cold-tempered, but he was soft like a bun in front of his mother. He was obedient and sensible in everything he said.In the latter half of the night, the temperature on little Zhao\u2019s forehead finally dropped. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s brain hurt a little. He didn\u2019t sleep too much these days. Even though it was late at night, he was still not sleepy.Song Luan loves their son. If she knew that this child was ill, she must have complained that she had not taken good care of him.When the sun came, little Zhao opened his eyes, his voice was soft and sticky, and he said, \u201cDad.\u201dZhao Nanyu put his palm on his forehead, \u201cYour fever\u2019s gone.\u201dPeople who are sick are always more vulnerable. Little Zhao threw himself into his arms, his tears poured out from the corners of his eyes, and one by one, it fell on Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sleeves. \u201cI dreamed of mother. I miss her so much.\u201dZhao Nanyu also missed her very much.He touched his head placidly, \u201cThen don\u2019t get sick easily. Your mother will be distressed when she comes back.\u201dZhao Nanyu had even thought that when Song Luan comes back, she must be watched closely, and she would never be given a chance to leave him.Even if she was dead, she would lay by his side.***The story of the little princess went on and on. She dreamed about it for five days. On the sixth day, she couldn\u2019t stand it any more, and rushed downstairs. The young man in taoist clothes still sat there.The man was not surprised at her appearance. In anticipation, he asked, \u201cDo you remember?\u201dShe didn\u2019t. She really had no memory.That was, every time she thought about it, she felt sad for a long time.Song Luan was a little angry, and this uncomfortable anger went to the young man. \u201cYou\u2019re still so young, and you act like a god.\u201dThe young man had a compassionate look, \u201cYou\u2019ll go back.\u201dThis was a destiny that couldn\u2019t be stopped.She would remember everything.She would like everyone except Zhao Nanyu. She would never fall in love with him again.The young man thought it would be his gift to her.Song Luan didn\u2019t want to talk to him any more. She turned around and left.All of a sudden, Song Luan\u2019s back brain ache, and she could only see black in front of her eyes, as she fainted.***After opening her eyes again, Song Luan found herself lying in a back alley. When she raised her eyes, she saw an antique house. Her eyes were blank and innocent, and she didn\u2019t realize what just happened.She had been able to calm down this time, and looked at the clothes she was wearing. It was very good. It looked like a costume.Song Luan slowly climbed up against the wall, not wanting to run directly to the river.The river reflected a familiar face. Her own appearance was exactly the same as the previous body\u2019s face.Did she transmigrate back again? Last time it was her soul that crossed over, this time it was her body.But this world was clearly a false world, a world created with the author\u2019s pen.Song Luan, who was still muddleheaded, walked in the street, for a moment she didn\u2019t know where to go. Her striking appearance walking in the street was very eye-catching, so she couldn\u2019t help but speed up her pace.Suddenly, a sedan chair rushed out from the corner. Song Luan retreated too quickly and fell to the ground. The servant who carried the sedan chair rushed forward, helped her up politely, and apologized in a low voice. \u201cMiss, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen Song Luan raised her face, the servant screamed, \u201cAh Ghost!\u201dHe crawled back trembling. The man in the sedan chair said in a displeased tone, \u201cWhat are you crying about?\u201d\u201cMy lord\u2026.It\u2019s the young lady of the Song family\u2026the ghost of the third lady of the Song family has been found.\u201dThe third young lady of the Song family had been dead for months. The Song family and the Zhao family had completely turned their faces and had no contact with each other again.It seemed that the Song family did not even intend to recognize their nephew. In a word, the two families were like water and fire.Zhao Wenyan rubbed his eyebrows. \u201cNonsense. Be careful with your mouth.\u201d\u201cYoung master, I really didn\u2019t talk nonsense. If you don\u2019t believe it, come out and see, It\u2019s really her.\u201dSong Luan also understood that it was Zhao Wenyan, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s brother, sitting in the sedan chair.She was a bit at a loss. To be honest, she had not figured out how to explain to him.Zhao Wenyan lifted the curtain, and his face was full of sharpness.When he saw the person in front of him, he was surprised, and couldn\u2019t say anything, \u201cSecond sister-in-law!?\u201dHe was confused, so he pinched his shoulder. After a long time, he managed to keep his mind steady. His face was white, as he stuttered, and said, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re not\u2026\u201dWasn\u2019t she dead? Her body was burned.He had seen her body with his own eyes. Now who was this person in front of him? There could never be someone that looked exactly like his second sister-in-law.Song Luan waved her hand and ran away before he could react.She hadn\u2019t figured out what to do. If she was taken back to Zhao residence by Zhao Wenyan, would she be treated as a monster?She could fool the rest.But how could she fool Zhao Nanyu? She was stabbed to death by him! He knew whether she was dead or not!So, Song Luan ran away.Zhao Wenyan still had time to go after her in the future, so he didn\u2019t bother to chase her.The servant spoke carefully and asked, \u201cSir, let\u2019s go and tell the young master about it.\u201dZhao Wenyan thought, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t tell my brother.\u201dHe didn\u2019t believe in bringing back the dead.Moreover, if this person was really his second sister-in-law, she looked like she didn\u2019t want to return to Zhao\u2019s residence.She didn\u2019t want to go back to his brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had no money, nor any valuable jewelry.A person who should have died reappeared, of course, Zhao Wenyan\u2019s face would be scared white by her.She wandered around the street for two times.It was getting dark. Song Luan\u2019s stomach murmured and protested. The smell of steamed buns reached her nose from far away. She moved closer, looked at the steamed buns, and swallowed.She was hungry and starving.I really want to eat\u2026wuwuwu.There were two more hands in her sight, and she heard a girl\u2019s faint voice. She pressed her voice for fear that others would hear her. \u201cBoss, I want two steamed buns.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dSong Luan turned her head. Even though the face in front of her was a little black, she still recognized the person at a glance, \u201cAyun?\u201dThe little girl\u2019s hands shook. The two steamed stuffed buns almost fell. Her eyes were in panic, but when she recognized Song Luan, she was relieved, \u201cMiss Song?\u201dSong Luan coughed twice, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dShe pointed to Ayun\u2019s dress and asked, \u201cHow did you get it?\u201dHer clothes were ragged and tattered, like those worn by beggars. Her face and arms were all covered with ashes.Ayun wanted to pull her by the corner of her dress. But after realizing that she was very dirty, she didn\u2019t touch her, and said trembling, \u201cMiss Song, can you pretend that you haven\u2019t seen me. Don\u2019t talk to Mr. Zhao after you go back.\u201dIf Zhao Nanyu knew her whereabouts, he would go and tell that man.She\u2019s only been out for a few days!?She\u2019s not going back.Li Han had better be dead.Song Luan\u2019s face was not comfortable. It seemed that Ayun didn\u2019t know about her death yet?! Anyway, she was like a celebrity. No one even talked about her when she\u2019s dead? It shouldn\u2019t be!Oh, yes, Ayun seemed to be more pitiful than her. No one could have told her the news that she had died. Otherwise, with her courage, she would have fainted.\u201cDid you sneak out?\u201d Song Luan guessed and asked.She had little admiration for Ayun in her heart. It\u2019s hard for her to escape from the palace. She didn\u2019t know how she got out.Ayun lowered her face, \u201cI\u2026I..\u201d She hesitated, and couldn\u2019t speak. She was afraid that Song Luan would tell her whereabouts.Ayun was so anxious that she was about to cry.Song Luan held her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I won\u2019t tell anyone else. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what to do.Ayun put away her tears and said several thanks. \u201cI had a lot of trouble just to slip out.\u201dShe was kept in prison for several months. Li Han ordered that no one was allowed to see her. The maid who delivered her meals every day was silent like a mute.She glared with her round her eyes and complained, \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me food, and I was hungry for days! I can\u2019t stand it, so I ran out. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t give you any trouble. I\u2019ll go now.\u201dSong Luan took her hand and said, \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026what\u2019s wrong?\u201dSong Luan asked awkwardly, \u201cDo you still have money?\u201dAyun shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no money, but I brought a lot of gold and silver jewelry with me.\u201dShe took out the golden jewelry in her arms and said, \u201cLook! I brought them all.\u201dShe also thought that she couldn\u2019t do without money. She didn\u2019t have silver, but she could exchange these things for silver.\u201cWell, do you have a place to go?\u201d Asked Song Luan.Ayun shook her head.Song Luan had the cheek to open her mouth, \u201cLet\u2019s be a companion!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t give me any food, so I came out secretly.\u201dSo far, she could only be a companion with Ayun! At least she didn\u2019t have to starve to death.Ayun didn\u2019t believe that, \u201cBut I think Mr. Zhao likes you very much.\u201dSong Luan pretended to wipe her tears. \u201cEvery family has a hard time. In fact, he wanted to kill me before I ran out.\u201dSong Luan remembered that she was not without money. Most of the small coffers she had saved in the past were still in the Zhao residence, and couldn\u2019t take them out. A small part was in Huai Jin\u2019s yard. She didn\u2019t appear in Huai Jin\u2019s sight. It\u2019s not good to frighten the little boy.The two women were talking. Jin Wuwei walked fiercely down the long street, searching door to door. It seemed that he was looking for someone. Song Luan thought that since he was sent by the palace, he must have come to find Ayun.She took Ayun to squat in the corner and pressed her face between her legs to prevent her from showing her head.Jin Wuwei has a sharp knife pinned to his waist. His face was heavy. He interrogated every person, one by one. It seemed that if he couldn\u2019t find who he was looking for, he would never give up.He didn\u2019t find anyone, so they went to the next place to search. Song Luan and Ayun now had a chance to breathe. If Ayun was found, she couldn\u2019t run away.It\u2019s very annoying.Song Luan took a hairpin given by Ayun and pawned it for 20 liang in the pawn shop. She didn\u2019t know that the gold hairpin was worth more than 20 liang, but now she couldn\u2019t care about that much money.Song Luan also wittily picked the worst business shops. Seeing the plaque, they all went to do business with the impending bankruptcy pawnshop.Ayun\u2019s things must have been given by the slag emperor.When Ayun heard her, she foolishly said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t give it to me. I bought it with my own money.\u201dSong Luan was curious, \u201cHow much did you spend?\u201dAyun thought about it and said, \u201cOne hundred taels!\u201dAlthough it was Li Han\u2019s money, Song Luan\u2019s flesh ached, there was so much losses!When she becomes rich, she would help Ayun redeem the gold hairpin.Ayun was obviously afraid of being alone. She held her hand all the time and hid behind her carefully. It\u2019s not hard to understand, since she had been hiding around for fear of being found.\u201cMiss Song, where are we going now? What should I do?\u201d She looked at Song Luan with her eyes wide open. \u201cOtherwise, let\u2019s go down to the south of the Yangtze River? My former home was in Jiangnan. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201dshe won\u2019t be chased if she went there.\u201cIt\u2019s too late. Let\u2019s find a place to live.\u201d\u201cOh, good.\u201dTwo people found a poor inn, and they carefully stayed inside.Ayun\u2019s body was dirty. After taking a bath and changing into a new dress, Song Luan could see the appearance of the lovely round faced girl before. However, she seemed not satisfied with her beautiful clothes. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be recognized. I\u2019d better put on the clothes I just wore. It was bought by me from a little beggar.\u201dNot before long, the streets would be covered with her portraits. Ayun really didn\u2019t want to be caught back. She would be locked up for a few months.She poked her fingers and was not very happy.When she was a child, Li Han was much more lovable than he was now. He never did anything that made her sad.When he said he would come back for revenge, she was unwilling, because when she was a child, she heard that the Imperial Palace was a place of cannibalism.At that time, Ayun just sent him to the wharf and had no intention of returning to the capital with him. But then her home was gone and there was no place to go, so she came back with Li Han.Why are men so fickle? Li Han called her every time, but he was merciless whenever he tortured and bullied her.If she didn\u2019t obey, he won\u2019t give her food, and even didn\u2019t feed her with water. Such a man was really cruel.So Ayun pretended to be dying. The maidservants lied to find the doctor. Then, she changed into the maid\u2019s clothes, and hid in the empty bucket and escaped from the palace.Song Luan comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I will smear your face with dirt tomorrow.\u201dTwo people were huddled together in a bed at night. Song Luan was sleepless and had a lot of things in her mind. She thought of Zhao Nanyu and his tears again. However, in addition to some blockage in her heart, the throbbing she had for Zhao Nanyu seemed to disappear.But she didn\u2019t know what Zhao Nanyu would do. Would he think of her as a fake? Or would he believe in ghosts and gods?After daybreak, Song Luan and Ayun packed up and went to the gate of the city. They went to the corner to have a look. The guard at the gate was extremely strict, and the portrait of Ayun was already pasted on the wall. There were still pictures of her in men\u2019s clothes on it.Song Luan took Ayun out of the gate and rented a remote courtyard for several liang of silver. Although the price was a little expensive, the yard was clean. At least they didn\u2019t have to clean it.They stayed there for the time being. Song Luan did not dare let Ayun go out to buy vegetables.However, whenever Song Luan went out, she would wear a veil every time. She was afraid that she would frighten people who knew her, just like the day she met Zhao Wenyan.She had no idea whether Zhao Wenyan would tell Zhao Nanyu what he saw.Ayun was a good breadwinner. She had no temper and was soft spoken. She ate whatever food that was available. Song Luan found that her appetite was amazing. She could eat two bowls of rice for each meal.A few days of comfort did not pass, because on the night that they had just gone to sleep, the yard door was banged loudly. It was as if they were going to kick the door open.Ayun shivered in the quilt. Song Luan could see that this little girl was really afraid of the slag emperor. She thought of the gorgeous cage she saw, and trembled all over.Abnormal men should really be feared.Like every time Zhao Nanyu said he\u2019d break her leg, she was also afraid of him.What\u2019s more, Zhao Nanyu seemed to have been blackened after they spent time together. Did he get anxious? When he looked at her, it felt like he was going to lock her up in the name of love.Suddenly, they heard a loud knock on the door.Song Luan touched her head and put on her clothes. \u201cYou hide in the haystack behind the stove.\u201dSong Luan had not forgotten to draw freckles on her face. Holding a lantern, she opened the gate of the courtyard, pretending to be impatient. \u201cWho is it? I can\u2019t sleep after knocking on the door in the middle of the night!\u201dShe faced a cold and heroic face right after she opened the door.There was a group of people standing behind him. His sharp eyes fixed on Song Luan\u2019s face for a long time, before confirming that she was not the person in the portrait, \u201cExcuse me.\u201dSong Luan acted as a shrew intensely. \u201cCan you do anything by disturbing me?! Do I have to be afraid of you just because you are in a group? Do you know that your acts are disturbing people? I have to get up early to do business tomorrow. Go and roll!\u201dAfter listening to her, the man waved to his subordinates, \u201cGo in and search.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face changed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dShe simply ignored her image and yelled, \u201cCome on, rob me!\u201dShe opened her collar slightly. \u201cIndecent ah! The imperial courts ordered officials to be indecent!!\u201dOriginally, none of her neighbors wanted to join in the fun, but when they heard the four words of \u2018the imperial court\u2019s order\u2019, the neighbors came out to see the excitement.With a sneer, the man pulled out the knife from his waist and said, \u201cGo in.\u201dThe crowd dispersed again.The group of people who searched the room did not go gentle at all.After a search, someone came out to report.\u201cMy lord, no one has been found.\u201dThe man looked calm. \u201cIt\u2019s in this area. We\u2019ll search the remaining houses tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSong Luan was terrified. When the guards went far away, she locked the door of the yard tightly, and pulled Ayun out of the haystack. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here any longer.\u201dAyun was still shaking, \u201cHow do you think they found me here?\u201dSong Luan instantly thought that it was the gold hairpin that they pawned! The hairpin was not ordinary at first glance, which was why she subconsciously thought that it was sent by the slag emperor!Ayun was too naive. She was afraid that the slag emperor just made her happy on a whim and \u2018sold\u2019 the hairpin to her.There was only little money left from them. Song Luan wanted to move, but she was in a tight corner. In addition, Jin Wuwei already came and went in this street, so he didn\u2019t set foot on their land boundary again.They relaxed.***Gu Yan met Zhao Nanyu, and he politely greeted him.Gu Yan, a five-and-three rough man, had to sigh to himself. Zhao Nanyu was really good-looking, too white, and had light vitality.He was busy catching people at the moment, so he didn\u2019t have time to exchange long greetings with Zhao Nanyu, so after two words, he was about to leave.Looking at Jin Wuwei behind him, Zhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows and asked, \u201cAre you looking for someone?\u201dGu Yan nodded, \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to get someone.\u201dZhao Nanyu shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too reckless. I\u2019m afraid the news will spread to her before you arrive.\u201dThe battle was too big.Gu Yan pondered and thought that there was some truth in what he said. They had searched the yard once before, but they didn\u2019t find out anything. It should be that they had already scared the snake.\u201cWhat Mr. Zhao said is reasonable, but if we don\u2019t bring more people, I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t find her.\u201dZhao Nanyu pulled the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou can\u2019t catch even a weak woman?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t remember what the woman Li Han wanted to recapture. He only remembered that she was timid.\u201cThen I will go first.\u201d Gu Yan stopped suddenly and asked, \u201cMr. Zhao, why don\u2019t we go together?\u201dZhao Nanyu paused for a while, then faintly said, \u201cIt\u2019s still not possible.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerGu Yan didn\u2019t force him. He heard that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s wife had just passed away.Although it was rumored that Zhao Nanyu settled old accounts with his wife and killed her, but Gu Yan didn\u2019t think so, because Zhao Nanyu looked very wistful.Gu Yan bowed his head, and said goodbye.Jin Wuwei blocked the water around the small courtyard with a knife where Song Luan and Ayun lived, and the light from the torch illuminated half of the sky.\u201cMy lord, it\u2019s set up.\u201dGu Yan made a gesture, and immediately someone came to knock on the door.Naturally, no one would come open the door for them. Gu Yan had lost his patience and gave a look, so Jin Wuwei kicked the gate of the courtyard directly.Song Luan, who was hiding in the house, was more or less aware that they had been discovered by them. It was really unexpected that in ancient times when information and communication were not yet developed, the slag emperor could still find someone so quickly.She walked up to Gu Yan, held her head high and laughed contemptuously. \u201cIf you like me, please tell me directly. It\u2019s really meaningless for you to break into my house again and again.\u201dGu Yan didn\u2019t know what to do. He asked his subordinates to hold her up. \u201cI suggest you shut up.\u201dLest if you\u2019re not afraid to die.Song Luan used to play the role of an arrogant lady. How could she be frightened by such a battle? She sneered and said, \u201cWait, I\u2019ll go to the government office tomorrow. What are you guys bullying a woman for?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t bear to see Ayun be taken back. The slag emperor both had grudges against ghosts and animals, and also kills people. It\u2019s blood abuse.Gu Yan\u2019s people once again searched, and got nothing. Their faces were very ugly. There was no reason why a little girl could not be found.Gu Yan looked at Song Luan with cold eyes and gnashed his teeth. \u201cTurn this place over for me. I don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t find anyone.\u201dSong Luan met his cold eyes, and didn\u2019t feel afraid at all. She hid Ayun in the opening of the stove. No one would think to look over it.The group of people tossed the room for half an hour, and Song Luan\u2019s wardrobe was already messed up.It wasn\u2019t a big place, so it didn\u2019t take long for them to turn it up.Gu Yan clenched the handle of the knife tightly, and his knuckles snapped a few times.He turned his eyes to Song Luan. He had never seen her face well before. Now that her face was illuminated by the light of the torch, he felt a little familiarity.He asked, \u201cHave I seen you before?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s heart jumped and pretended to be calm. \u201cHa ha, how old are the ways to pick up women these days!\u201dSure enough, Gu Yan shut up and didn\u2019t mention it again.Song Luan felt that she was going to piss this man to death.\u201cMr. Gu, I don\u2019t know where she is hiding.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t miss even a single thing. Search carefully.\u201dSong Luan remembered that this person was the elder brother of the original owner\u2019s closest friend, the eldest son of Gu family, Gu Yan.Gu Yan, who was disgusted with the original owner, cut off her contact with her sister several times. It was estimated that because of the things that the original owner did, he hated her and did not want to see her.Song Luan was glad that he had not seen her, otherwise it would be troublesome to be recognized.Gu Yan couldn\u2019t bear it. He pinched her neck, and only gave a little space to breathe. \u201cWhere is she? If you don\u2019t talk, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t believe that he would dared to kill, so she raised her face, closed her eyes, and said, \u201cOkay, okay, you can kill me. Just kill me, lest I live in this world and be humiliated by you. I can\u2019t even understand what and who you are talking about. It\u2019s baffling.\u201dShe was devoid of any sense of shame, just like a pig not afraid of the boiling water.He had lived for almost thirty years, but had never seen such a shameless woman.The women in his eyes were all knowledgeable, clever, sensible, and none of them were as shrewd and unreasonable as she was.Gu Yan reluctantly let go of her, but Song Luan began to play mischievous, and seized his hand. \u201cDo you want to kill me? I\u2019ll tell you, if you don\u2019t kill me today, you\u2019ll be a bastard! You are a scumbag!\u201dGu Yan made a gesture to his opponent, \u201cBlock her mouth.\u201d After a pause, \u201cBy the way, please bring Mr. Zhao here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d***Zhao Wenyan struggled for many days, but he hadn\u2019t decided whether to tell him about what happened to his second sister-in-law.Seeing his second brother-in-law living like a corpse, he felt very sad.It\u2019s late at night, and Ruan Sheng was still sitting under the candle light embroidering shoes. He walked over with an unnatural tone. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Don\u2019t be busy. You can do it tomorrow.\u201dRuan Sheng said with a smile, \u201cGo to bed first. I\u2019ll make my nephew-in-law shoes first before I head off to sleep. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201dLittle Zhao was only five years old, and just lost his mother. His father\u2019s heart also went with her.Zhao Wenyan thought for a long time. He even forgot to think about their son. The child was not very talkative, but after Song Luan passed away, his talking became lesser than before.Zhao Wenyan was biting his teeth while he went to the study to find his second brother.Zhao Nanyu just coaxed little Zhao to sleep.When he opened the door, he saw his younger brother. He was expressionless as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhao Wenyan nodded, and asked, \u201cSecond brother, is she really dead?\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s sharp eyes swept toward him. His face seemed to be covered with layers of black gas. No one dared to mention Song Luan in front of him for a long time.Zhao Wenyan cowered by his death gaze. He was afraid, so he added, \u201cI bumped into a person who looked exactly like second sister-in-law in the street.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked at him for a long time and said, \u201cZhao Wenyan, I don\u2019t have the heart to make jokes with you now. You\u2019d better not tease me with her affairs, okay?\u201dEven his own brother wanted to strangle him directly.Zhao Nanyu originally thought that he wouldn\u2019t feel pain anymore, but when he closed his eyes, he remembered that Song Luan had been stabbed to death by him, and the sudden fire that had left her body to ashes\u2026There was nothing left.The feeling that he couldn\u2019t hold on to her was really painful. Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t want to taste it again.If it were really like Zhao Wenyan had said, that she came back, Zhao Nanyu would think that he had gone mad. It wouldn\u2019t be normal.He would definitely locked up Song Luan, so she could only stay in his sight forever.Zhao Wenyan explained, \u201cHow can I make fun of you about my second sister-in-law? I really saw her.\u201d\u201cSo what about her?! Zhao Wenyan, don\u2019t you tell me that you let her go when you saw her?\u201d Zhao Nanyu\u2019s voice suddenly sharpened. \u201cWhat about her, where is she then?!\u201dZhao Wenyan bowed his head and said to himself, \u201cShe ran away. As soon as I saw her, she ran away.\u201dIt rained this morning. The eaves were still dripping with rain. The sound was clear and crisp.\u201cYoung master, it seems that Mr. Gu is in trouble. Please go to the outskirts of the city to help him.\u201dZhao Nanyu passed by Zhao Wenyan, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dWhen passing by Ah Yan, he did not forget to leave a sentence, \u201cWhen I come back, you can tell me clearly.\u201dThis evening, he met Gu Yan on the road, but he didn\u2019t expect that a delicate woman was so difficult to catch, and she was still not caught at this point.***When Song Luan heard that Gu Yan was going to ask Zhao Nanyu for help, her brain couldn\u2019t react. Her mouth was blocked to death, and she could only make a \u2018wuwuwu\u2019 voice.She couldn\u2019t speak, so she had to kick Gu Yan with her feet, and act like a shrew.Gu Yan refused to pay any attention to her at all. Song Luan opened her teeth and bit the hand of the man who covered her mouth, then she was relieved.\u201cMr. Gu, who are you looking for? You can\u2019t go anywhere else?! It\u2019s dark. I\u2019m really weak. I want to sleep.\u201dBefore Zhao Nanyu came, she would then slip away or leave the area.There was no other choice.Gu Yan tolerated her extremely hard work and wished to sew her mouth up. \u201cShut up.\u201dSong Luan continued to speak to him in a good voice, \u201cWell, you keep looking. I\u2019ll go to the inn and have a rest.\u201dGu Yan\u2019s eyebrows jumped, \u201cGet out of here.\u201dSong Luan was overjoyed and said, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201dShe felt that she was really a wizard. She let Ayun cover herself in black cloth and hid in the stove! Nobody could find her.Song Luan just stepped out of the threshold, when Gu Yan changed his mind, \u201cYou stop.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAfter you get out of here, be obedient from now on. Why don\u2019t you shut up when you need to shut up?\u201dSong Luan blushed with anger. Gu Yan was playing with her. He didn\u2019t want to let her go.When Zhao Nanyu arrived, he saw only a woman with a disheveled hair, squeezing her neck to face Gu Yan\u2019s eyes. He was too far away to hear what she said.What Song Luan said was still those haughty words, \u201cIf you are a man, kill me, otherwise you let me go.\u201dZhao Nanyu glanced around. \u201cHasn\u2019t Mr. Gu found anyone yet?\u201dWhen Song Luan heard this voice, her whole body shrank. She moved quickly to Gu Yan, hiding behind him, and using this man\u2019s tall body to hide herself tightly.She poked out a pair of eyes, and only dared to carefully look at his side. Zhao Nanyu was more raging than before.Song Luan quietly retracted her own line of sight back, praying that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s attention would not turn to her.Gu Yan said with a heavy face, \u201cNo, it\u2019s well hidden.\u201dZhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows. \u201cHave you searched every corner?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cKitchen?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? There\u2019s nothing missing? As long as the place is possible for people to hide, we have to demolish them. Kitchen, stove, and cottage, all over again.\u201dSomeone whispered, \u201cYou can\u2019t hide a beautiful girl in the pit, right? How dirty will it be. The opening of the stove is so small that it can\u2019t hide a person. As for the cottage, let alone the little girl, we can\u2019t even stand it. How can one be able to hide?\u201dGu Yan murmured, \u201cListen to Lord Zhao, and go find her.\u201dSong Luan really despised Zhao Nanyu. He was worthy of being a male lead. He had all kinds of martial arts skills, and was good at finding people.It didn\u2019t take long for the disheveled and dirty-face Ayun be pulled out.She had two tears hanging on her face. She was scared.She was so timid that she cried out on the spot and hiccuped, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201dAyun saw Song Luan hiding behind Gu Yan, and suddenly fell silent.She felt that Miss Song was miserable, because Mr. Zhao was standing here.Song Luan made a gesture to her.Ayun immediately understood, sucked her nose, and silently turned her eyes from her side.Ayun who was caught was unable to run away.\u201cMiss, I\u2019ve seen you in the palace. The emperor has been waiting for you for a long time.\u201dShe pointed to Zhao Nanyu, \u201cI want him to send me now.\u201dZhao Nanyu hooked his lips, sneered, and brushed his sleeve. \u201cMy child is very sick. Since you have found her, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201dHe didn\u2019t give any face.Ayun also felt very good. It was good that he chose to leave, so Miss Song would be okay.Suddenly someone asked, \u201cCommander, what about this shrew?\u201dHe was just bitten by her, and this man still held a grudge\u2026ShrewPoorWomanGu Yan had a headache. If the emperor knew that this woman was helping her hide, the emperor must have wanted her to die.He pulled Song Luan out of his back and said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you just rude? Why are you as good as a dog now?\u201dZhao Nanyu was just about to leave, and didn\u2019t mean to spare a glance at the other side, but when he did, his eyes changed dramatically, and his facial features were somewhat ferocious. He stopped immediately.Song Luan\u2019s heart sank. It was over, she was discovered.She rolled her eyes and scolded Gu Yan, \u201cYou are the dog.\u201dGu Yan sneered, but before he could speak, a gust of wind swept in his ear, and the woman on his side was dragged to the other end.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand was like a pair of pliers, as he grasped her wrist hard. His dark eyes were staring at her, his hands seemed to tremble, and his hoarse voice quivered, \u201cSong Luan?\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t tell\u2026her inner feelings were a little sour, sad, and there was a little joy of reunion after parting, but it seemed that she didn\u2019t feel any heart-thumping feeling.She opened her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dSong Luan felt that his eyes were a little scary. Oh, how could she feel that he had blackened!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was actually very ignorant, and didn\u2019t expect that she would be caught by Zhao Nanyu so soon.Gu Yan\u2019s eyebrows moved. The martial arts practitioner\u2019s ear power was excellent.He could hear him say \u2018Song Luan\u2019 clearly. His eyes became deep, and he was puzzled. Wasn\u2019t that woman dead?Zhao Nanyu pulled Song Luan behind him, blocked her face, and said slowly, \u201cMr. Gu, I\u2019ll take her first.\u201dAs for the others, he didn\u2019t want to take care of any of them.Gu Yan didn\u2019t stop him. His task had been completed. The unreasonable woman behind Zhao Nanyu had nothing to do with him.It didn\u2019t matter who she was. However, if she was really Song Luan, Gu Yan still remembered that his sister seemed to have a good relationship with her.Gu Yan arched his hands and said, \u201cGo slowly.\u201dSong Luan felt that her wrist were red now, and it was really painful to be held by him.She followed him and murmured in a low voice, \u201cCan you be gentle?\u201dZhao Nanyu was silent and threw her directly into the carriage. With a heavy face, he said to the coachman in a cold voice, \u201cGo back to the residence.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s hair was disheveled, and her dark hair messily fell on her shoulder. She shrank in the corner silently, trying to reduce her sense of existence.On the other side, Ayun shrank as Gu Yan looked at her, \u201cYoung lady, I\u2019ll see you off.\u201dAyun pointed to her dirty clothes. \u201cLet me change clothes before I go. He must be unhappy to see me dirty.\u201dGu Yan examined with his eyes, and said, \u201cHurry up.\u201dAyun was very happy, \u201cOkay.\u201dShe ran back to the house and got out of the back door of the kitchen.The wall was small. She often took Li Han to climb the wall when she was a child. This height was nothing to her.Suddenly, a cold voice came from behind, \u201cYoung lady, I advise you to go back honestly. The emperor has been waiting for a long time. I fear that his anger would be even worse.\u201dGu Yan now refused to let her change clothes. He took the dirty little girl back to the palace.***The atmosphere in the carriage was too depressing. Song Luan felt that she was about to be suffocated. She turned her eyes and carefully looked at Zhao Nanyu. This sight happened to match his dark eyes. She was shocked by the stare.Song Luan continued to shrink back into the corner, as if it was too late to repent, \u201cIn fact, I am not Song Luan, why don\u2019t you let me out of the carriage?\u201dZhao Nanyu did not say a word, approached her, and casually tied her scattered hair.Song Luan\u2019s hair hurt a little when he pulled it. She bared her teeth and said, \u201cYou loosen it. I don\u2019t like to tie it up.\u201dZhao Nanyu held her hand, while the other hand that was holding her hair also slightly hardened.Hearing her take a breath of cold air, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dThis hoarse voice sounded terrible and frightening.Song Luan shuddered slightly and had goose bumps on her arm. She knew Zhao Nanyu was really different from before.Pretend tenderness no longer exists.He was violent, authoritarian, and ruthless.After her messy hair was tied, she didn\u2019t look so crazy at last.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s slender fingers slowly climbed up her cheek, and the crazy obsession in his dark eyes was revealed. He murmured, \u201cYou are back at last.\u201dSong Luan guessed that the young taoist must have done a good job for her to crossed back over.Song Luan was brought back to the Zhao family by Zhao Nanyu. She found that her original residence seemed to have disappeared.Maybe it was the same as the ending in the book\u2013it was burned.Song Luan stayed in a strange room.Looking at Zhao Nanyu, she summoned up her courage and said, \u201cAre you not afraid?\u201d\u201cWhat should I be afraid of?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been dead, don\u2019t you want to ask what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to listen. Song Luan always uses various reasons to leave him.Song Luan felt that his stubbornness was worse than before, and her brain hurt a little. She didn\u2019t want to tell him that the world was just a world in a book.On the first night when Song Luan was taken back, nothing happened. Zhao Nanyu simply held her and slept with her all night. In the middle of the night, Song Luan felt a little out of breath. She woke up with a red face and found that the man holding her was not sleeping. It seemed that he had been watching her all the time.It was not until the next morning that Song Luan realized that it was wrong. The door of the room was locked. She had wanted to open the window, but she found that the window was also nailed to death. It was airtight.There was no light in the room, and it looked a little dull.Song Luan was so angry that she wanted to lose her temper. At first, she couldn\u2019t find anyone to lose her temper. When Zhao Nanyu came into the room, she asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by locking the window and locking the door?\u201dPrison Play?!She wasn\u2019t sick anymore.Zhao Nanyu rubbed her face with a smile. \u201cAh Yan told me that he saw you, but you ran away cleverly, so I think you probably don\u2019t want to come back.\u201dSong Luan pointed to the wooden window that had been nailed to death. \u201cSo you lock me up just because of this?\u201dZhao Nanyu frowned and thought about it carefully, then he said slowly, \u201cI think it\u2019s very good.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s ears were red and her teeth were trembling. \u201cDidn\u2019t you poison me to kill me? Is it wrong for me to run?\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded and thought for a long time. He went to the desk, took out the dagger from the drawer, and put it into her hand. \u201cI hurt you, so now, you can stab me back.\u201dSong luan couldn\u2019t do it. Both of them knew this in their hearts.Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t seem to be joking with her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I can do this by myself, and you will be satisfied.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like this. It\u2019s boring.\u201dShe would really be fooled by his bitter tricks again.Zhao Nanyu sighed. His face that was bright as the moon seemed to be very sympathetic. He said, \u201cIf you leave me, where do you want to go? No money, no guide, you don\u2019t even have an identification id. Where can you go?\u201dSong Luan muttered, \u201cI can go to my mother.\u201dZhao Nanyu slowly opened his smile. His smile was extremely eye-catching and beautiful. He said, \u201cDid you forget? You\u2019re a dead person. Will your mother believe it? Won\u2019t they be scared to death? Wouldn\u2019t they think you\u2019re a monster?\u201dSong Luan felt cold in the back of her head.After a burst of fear, she asked, \u201cJust tell me?\u201dZhao Nanyu looked pitiful, as if he was really sad. He opened his lips and said, \u201cNo one in the world will regard you as the third miss of the Song family except me. You have no identity and can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\u201cIn their eyes, the real third lady of the Song family had been burned away.\u201dSong Luan understood what he said. It was easier to understand. She was now dead. She couldn\u2019t do anything.When she appeared on the street openly, she was afraid of being recognized by some acquaintances.\u201cWhat do you want? Lock me up for a lifetime?! Zhao Nanyu, can you wake up?\u201dWhy did she die once, this person was even more crazy!Zhao Nanyu lowered his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, so I won\u2019t.\u201dHe raised his clear eyes, looked at her, and continued, \u201cI\u2019m not locking you down. I just want you to be with me.\u201dHe spoke in a pitiful tone.Song Luan\u2019s temper improved a lot, and restrained her anger. \u201cCan you tear down the lock on the door and the board on the window?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes widened. Zhao Nanyu used to say a lot of nice things to her whenever he refused!Woo woo woo, he really changed.Song Luan couldn\u2019t make a sense about him, and decided not to let him hold her that night.Lying on the bed barefoot, Zhao Nanyu had just fallen asleep on her side. Her feet kicked him and muttered, \u201cI hate you. You go away.\u201dZhao Nanyu took advantage of the situation and pulled her white feet into his arms. He said in a deep voice, \u201cWho do you hate?\u201dSong Luan took a deep breath, and then kicked him rudely, \u201cI hate you.\u201dZhao Nanyu untied her collar, bent down, and smelled the fragrance of her white neck. He opened his mouth, took a bite on her shoulder, and chuckled in a low voice, \u201cGo on.\u201dSong Luan was too scared to move. Her toes curled up and her body was tense.However, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t let her go. His belt and clothes fell to the ground one by one, and his chest was thin and the lines were smooth and powerful.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk?\u201dShe\u2019s afraid, couldn\u2019t he tell!!! Please let her go, woo woo.Song Luan was imprisoned in his arms and could not move. Her face flushed red and she murmured.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s actions became more and more excessive, and his strength became more and more fierce.It seemed that she had to make up for it at one time. Song Luan was sweating, and her thin sweat was slipping down from her forehead. She sobbed for mercy. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, don\u2019t hate you, okay?! You should be gentle.\u201d\u201cNo gentleness.\u201dSong Luan was the meat on the chopping board. She was tortured by him.She completely put down her backbone, choked, and coquettishly begged. \u201cWuwuwuwu, please forgive me. I\u2019m wrong.\u201dIn the warm night of the spring, the sound in the lotus gradually subsided after midnight.Song Luan was covered in quilts, and her shoulder was full of green marks. She looked pitiful.She couldn\u2019t move her fingers. She didn\u2019t know where Zhao Nanyu learned so many tricks.She\u2019s so ashamed!Shameless smelly man.When Song Luan woke up again, she saw his beautiful and excessive face. She tilted her head and looked at him for a while, feeling empty.It\u2019s calm.Calm as if she wasn\u2019t moved by him.Thinking of what he had done last night, Song Luan boldly poked her finger in his face, and whined, \u201cBad thing.\u201dSeeing that he didn\u2019t wake up, she poked again in anger, \u201cBad thing, I\u2019ll ignore you!\u201dHmpf!T/N: One talented reader sent me a fan art of how she thinks WCE will end\u2026it\u2019s so prettyyyyy\u2026 It\u2019s just like how I imagined it will be!!! <3 Thank you, Hirare, for this wonderful masterpiece!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MaryThe door was closed and there was no light in the room.A long time had passed since Ayun was thrown in. There was a heavy footstep that seemed to come nearer.\u201cOh, where is this dirty cat from?\u201d His tone seemed to be mocking, but not entirely.His eyes were cool as he glanced at the person in front of him. Just as he was about to reach out and wipe the dirt off her face, Ayun subconsciously dodged back.Li Han\u2019s eyes suddenly turned ferocious, but still smiled, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Little dirty cats don\u2019t have a long memory?\u201dHe firmly buttoned her chin, and with a casual smile, he took out a square of a handkerchief from the cuff and wiped the dirt on her face, \u201cMiserable, dirty, not beautiful.\u201dLi Han spoke to her again. Ayun was scared to death, but she raised her head and looked at him directly. She said the words in her heart, \u201cLi Han, you are an ungrateful white-eyed wolf!\u201dIf not because her parents were soft-hearted, could he live up to now!?No one in the world probably knew that she was a few months older than Li Han.At that time, she had never seen this younger brother before. Ayun had lost her temper, cried, and wanted to drive him away.Later she thought it would be nice to have a playmate, and he was the best looking child she had ever seen.Who would have thought how bad this person becomes when he grows up?Li Han said with a casual smile, \u201cNow you are the only one who dares to call me that taboo. How dare you.\u201dHe suddenly used his strength. \u201cDon\u2019t you like the rich clothes and luxuriant food? Why escape? Do you want to marry someone else? If you just remember to eat and not to fight, then everything will be fine. You haven\u2019t learned enough, haven\u2019t you?\u201dWhen Ayun was 15 years old, she had a sweetheart. The man was kind and simple, and his family background was ordinary. Not to mention how rich he was, he had several acres of good farmland and could eat a full meal.That was enough.At that time, Ayun was waiting for him to come to propose marriage, but he suddenly died.Ayun was very sad. After crying for three days, her eyes swelled into walnuts.Not long ago, she learned that Li Han had done many cruel things secretly.In Ayun\u2019s eyes, Li Han was a dark man who could smile at everyone. She never thought that he was so calculating, aggressive, and could kill people.\u201cThe maid who served you last time was killed by me. She deserves to die for not guarding you properly.\u201d The room was hazy, and he blocked the only light shining on her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if you don\u2019t move or run away, I won\u2019t kill anyone. \u201c***Zhao Nanyu had not locked the door. However, Song Luan did not intend to leave. As he said, she was now a person with no identity, probably only a paranoid man like Zhao Nanyu would believe that she was Song Luan.Most of the people she knew had seen her body and witnessed the fire.In their eyes, she was already a dead person.She knew that Zhao Nanyu had a way to get her identity back, but he never mentioned it. Perhaps he wished that she would not be seen for the rest of her life by anyone other than him.Without the name of the third miss of the Song family, she had no parents, no brothers, and no one to rely on. She could only grow like a dodder flower on his high branches.Zhao Nanyu would bring her strange things every day, treated her as a child, and deliberately coaxed her to be happy.Song Luan had been very calm in the face of him. Sometimes he wouldn\u2019t let her out of his sight. Song Luan was angry but gradually realized that she didn\u2019t have much emotion for Zhao Nanyu.This seemed to be a good thing, but her heart unexpectedly felt some uneasiness, always feeling that something went wrong.Zhao Nanyu seemed to have fallen out with the Zhao family. These days, some Zhao members went to his bedroom and scratched the crack of the window. Song Luan heard the second lady\u2019s swearing words.Zhao Nanyu was expressionless as he told the guards to drive her away.She didn\u2019t know what happened to the Zhao family.Song Luan propped up her chin and looked out of the window at the sky. Her face was melancholy, and many strange pictures flashed through her mind.***Song Luan complained in her heart. Why did he have to tell her the story of the princess and the prince? She died so miserably in the end. It was not good at all.She remembered that in the past dream, a familiar voice said in her ear that the woman who was tied to the tower and was pierced by an arrow was her.Song Luan only took this sentence as a joke. Was she so miserable? Always dying through the heart!?It\u2019s a pity that she could never see the man in her dream.Song Luan did not like to recall the story of the princess. She naturally rejected it. She didn\u2019t like it.But she couldn\u2019t stand all the pictures that drilled into her brain. Those memories felt like they belonged to her originally.Song Luan stood up, raised her hands, and stretched out. Turning her head, she found that the man lying on the desk was unconsciously asleep.Zhao Nanyu seemed very tired these days. His eyes were black, and his expression was wary.When Song Luan had just walked by, the man lying on the desk moved. He immediately opened his eyes. His eyes were a little dimmed, but when he saw Song Luan, he raised his lips and smiled at her.The afterglow shone diagonally, this sudden smile was a little sweet.Song Luan coughed twice. \u201cIf you are tired, go to bed.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to get sick if you sleep on the table.Zhao Nanyu rubbed his eyebrows, and his sight gradually became clear. He spoke with a strong nasal voice, \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201dAs the day grew dark, he asked, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s face blushed. Zhao Nanyu and her tummy knew each other. She was about to wake him up just to tell him about this.She couldn\u2019t see anyone in Zhao\u2019s residence. Even when she was hungry, she didn\u2019t dare to call her servant girl in.Song Luan touched her empty stomach, and her voice was like the sound of a mosquito. \u201cYes, yes, I am hungry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have the food prepared.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d She stopped him suddenly.Zhao Nanyu turned and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t care about keeping her face.She blushed and stammered, \u201cI want to eat salted duck.\u201dSong Luan had to follow Zhao Nanyu vegetarian diet for many days, which made her greedy for meat.Zhao Nanyu pursed his lips and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dHe knew that his thoughts and ideas were not right and normal now, but he thought this moment was nice.Song Luan had no branch to rely on and even could not go out of the door. She could only stay in his small world.His strong desire for control had been suppressed for many years, and once this was opened, it was out of control.Why didn\u2019t he know that he was so egotistical before? But there was no way, his love had always been selfish.The servant girl bowed her head and did not dare to look at him all the way.Song Luan ate two bowls of rice and had a good appetite. Zhao Nanyu filled her with a bowl of sweet soup. He was so happy that he put something in her mouth for fear that she would not be full.Song Luan hiccuped, and she suddenly said, \u201cAh Yu, you can\u2019t let me stay in this room all my life, can you?\u201dSome people knew her in the capital, so long as she won\u2019t leave, won\u2019t it be okay?Zhao Nanyu saw through what she was thinking and said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201dWith a slightly sarcastic smile, he continued, \u201cEven if I don\u2019t do it, you still can\u2019t get out of the gate.\u201dShe did not have a pass certificate and would only be detained at the gate of the city.Song Luan smiled sweetly. Zhao Nanyu was trembling for a moment, so she took the initiative to sit beside him, grabbed his wide sleeve, and shook it gently. Her voice was sweet and greasy, \u201cYou help me get an identity, okay?\u201dZhao Nanyu was now a man who covered the sky with only his one hand. It\u2019s easy to make a fake identity for her. It depended on whether he was willing or not.It showed that he was not willing to do so.Zhao Nanyu had a bad taste. He liked her to beg him.\u201cI know you\u2019re suffocating. When we move out, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cMove out of here?!\u201dZhao Nanyu wanted to keep her as a concubine!? Song Luan didn\u2019t care about the false name, it was good to be out of sight, so she could feel relaxed.He nodded to her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the new residence is about to be built, and you won\u2019t be wronged.\u201dThe Zhao family was going to separate.Because of this, they quarreled with each other. Zhao Nanyu\u2019s grandfather was still alive, so it was not reasonable to separate the family.Third master Zhao thought so, but he couldn\u2019t shake his son\u2019s idea. He scolded Zhao Nanyu several times, but he could not discipline him entirely.Song Luan still misunderstood what he meant. She decided to hit the iron while it was hot. She looked at Zhao Nanyu with tears in her eyes, as if she wanted to cry to arouse his pity, \u201cWoo, since you want to raise me as a concubine, I can\u2019t help but think you have to compensate me.\u201dWhen Zhao Nanyu heard the word \u2018concubine\u2019, his face was not very good-looking, but his smile did not diminish. He raised his eyebrows and asked, \u201cWhat compensation do you want?\u201dSong Luan squeezed out two false tears. \u201cI won\u2019t hate you for such a big injustice, as long as you will get me something that can prove my identity.\u201dIt was really hard for a person with no identity to go anywhere and do nothing.Zhao Nanyu pulled her to him with a deep smile and wiped away her tears with cold fingers. \u201cDo you have other requests?\u201dSong Luan foolishly climbed up the pole he handed her, and said, \u201cIn the future, you will not go to my side. I am afraid that I will be sad if I meet you. Also, it is not easy for me to live outside alone. You remember to give me more gold and silver.\u201dThe money that could be spent was much better than jewelry.Zhao Nanyu listened silently, but his face did not show. He only said with a smile, \u201cI thought you would ask me to send you little Zhao and let you take him.\u201dSong Luan was stunned, pursed her mouth tightly as if she suddenly lost her voice.Zhao Nanyu played with her fingers, pretending to be unintentional, and said, \u201cIn the recent months, although he doesn\u2019t say anything, he misses you very much in his heart.\u201cHe probably thought he would never see you again, and he cried behind my back several times.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see him?\u201dThese days, Song Luan never mentioned this matter, not because she forgot little Zhao, but because she was afraid to frighten the child.Song Luan looked back and nodded, \u201cI want to see him.\u201dZhao Nanyu said, \u201cWhen the right time comes, I will bring him to you.\u201dHe took a bite on her delicate earlobe and said with a stuffy smile, \u201cYou didn\u2019t act very well just now. It seems that you are very happy to be in an outside room .\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes seemed like they were flying high up the sky.The way she pretended to cry was really lovely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MarySong Luan was a little embarrassed when he exposed her. She laughed and tried to muddle through.However, Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t care about it. He stroked her face with gentle fingertips. With a complicated tone, he said, \u201cYou really make me helpless.\u201dBesides hiding her well, Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t think of a better way.Song Luan couldn\u2019t get out of his yard, nor could she see little Zhao. She had nothing to do every day and felt bored. She didn\u2019t even have a person who she could speak to. Zhao Nanyu never lets anyone except him get close to this room. Everything about her needs was done by Zhao Nanyu himself.If things go on like this, Song Luan would feel tired, and wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe under his strong control.She was angry, but she didn\u2019t feel any sadness. Of course, Zhao Nanyu would kiss her or whisper sultry words in her ear, but Song Luan would only look at him with a pair of ignorant eyes as if she didn\u2019t feel anything in her heart. She wouldn\u2019t blush red, and her heartbeat wouldn\u2019t jump up and down like before. It\u2019s as if nothing happened.After a few days, Zhao Nanyu was separated from the Zhao family. Whatever he wanted to do this time, no one could dare stop him.Zhao Nanyu held her in his arms that day and took her to the carriage. All the people in the family were surprised. They didn\u2019t know when the young master had an extra woman? Her face was covered, so no one could see it.The second wife did not like Zhao Nanyu very much. Her husband was suppressed by him intentionally in the court. She held a grudge for a long time.Seeing this opportunity, she said strangely, \u201cSure enough, it\u2019s different when a man gets power. It\u2019s not long after Song Luan\u2019s death that her husband found a new love? There is really no man in this world who\u2019s affectionate. It\u2019s just that I pity my good daughter-in-law. No one knew how she died, and she even bore a son just for others. It\u2019s truly in vain.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t help but want to poke out her head. Zhao Nanyu silently pressed her back. He didn\u2019t even pay attention to the second lady. He turned around and got on the carriage.Song Luan wanted to laugh a little bit when she heard the second lady speak against her injustice. In the beginning, the second lady had always targeted her and regarded her as a thorn in her eyes. Now that she spoke for her, Song Luan didn\u2019t know the picture of the situation.Little Zhao sat alone in the back carriage. His face looked pale, as he lowered his head. His gloomy eyes looked at his father several times. Song Luan wore a cloak and did not show her face. It was understandable that the child wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize her.The new house was half an hour\u2019s drive from the Zhao family. Song Luan had never been out the door since Zhao Nanyu captured her. She lifted the curtain and took a deep breath of fresh air.To this day, she knew that Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t let her go. Stubborn people are very stubborn in everything.Song Luan felt that her requirements had become very low. Since she couldn\u2019t escape, she just prayed silently that Zhao Nanyu would not continue to lock her up.When the carriage stopped, Song Luan was still a little reluctant to go down. She looked up at the imposing new house, and she naturally felt a sense of inexplicable fear in her heart. She felt that it was difficult for her to get out once she went in.She reluctantly held the door frame of the carriage. Zhao Nanyu looked at her and asked softly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t you like it?\u201dSong Luan certainly didn\u2019t like it!She looked at him with a pair of reddish eyes and did not speak. She tried to soften his heart with such pathetic eyes.Zhao Nanyu did not force her out of the carriage \u201cReally not planning to get down?\u201dSong Luan was a little flustered, and complained in a low voice, \u201cThen you can\u2019t lock me up anymore.\u201dZhao Nanyu also knew what she was afraid of, so he laughed and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThen you can\u2019t lie to me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you.\u201dSong Luan couldn\u2019t rest assured even if she got Zhao Nanyu\u2019s promise. She knew that Zhao Nanyu was probably lying to her.Song Luan\u2019s house was very gorgeous and luxurious. There were three screens of huanghuali . The window was decorated elegantly for women, which looked very exquisite. The patterns embroidered on it were lifelike. A huge bed was placed directly opposite the dressing table. The red curtain fell from the top of the head of the bed, and several red candles were lit on the bedside table.Song Luan collapsed on a blanket made of snow-white fox hair. Her table was filled with golden jewelry.Zhao Nanyu asked her, \u201cDo you like it?\u201dThis room was really beautiful.Song Luan truthfully said, \u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful.\u201dShe didn\u2019t tell him whether she liked it or not. Who would love cages? She didn\u2019t like gold cages.\u201cMy Lord, the young master wants to see you.\u201d The voice of the attendant came through the door.Song Luan\u2019s heart trembled, and she lowered her face to cover up her uncomfortable expression.Zhao Nanyu said lightly, \u201cLet him come.\u201dZhao Nanyu and little Zhao were talking outside. Song Luan stayed inside.She couldn\u2019t resist not listening and gradually couldn\u2019t sit still. She stealthily hid by the door and pricked up her ears to listen.Little Zhao seemed to cry, and his voice was a little dumb, \u201cFather, I don\u2019t like\u2026I don\u2019t like that woman.\u201dHe would not recognize anyone but his mother.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes glanced toward the direction where Song Luan had been hiding. He took back his eyes and touched little Zhao\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d\u201cYou really want to marry her?\u201d\u201cWho told you all this?\u201d Zhao Nanyu asked.\u201cI saw it today. You held her.\u201dZhao Nanyu did not explain, but said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that much.\u201dLittle Zhao bit his lip, feeling sad to death.After they talked, Zhao Nanyu sent someone to accompany little Zhao back to his residence.Song Luan couldn\u2019t see what Zhao Nanyu wanted to do. How could he be willing to hurt his child\u2019s heart?Even if she missed her son, she still held back and did not ask him.She thought that Zhao Nanyu was waiting for her to surrender. That fact was true. Zhao Nanyu also knew that Song Luan\u2019s heart was not with him. He could only trap her.Zhao Nanyu wanted to tame Song Luan and get her heart, but Song Luan didn\u2019t have him in her eyes.Those light-colored eyes, every time she looked at him, they were only plain and flat, as if he was just an insignificant person.***In the evening, Zhao Nanyu received a visitor. He was this year\u2019s candidate who came third in the Han-Lin examination. He was a handsome man, and was dressed in white, and looked very gentle.A piece of white jade hung around the man\u2019s waist and a folding fan in his hand. He was in high spirits as he pursed his lips and chuckled.Song Luan\u2019s heart beat faster for a moment. When facing Zhao Nanyu, she thought she had lost the ability to love! No, she could still be moved by a good-looking man.She took off her shoes and laid on the bed. Her feet were shaking happily. Suddenly, she wanted to see the flower scholar again.She didn\u2019t know what to say, but she felt that the man she liked should be like this.He was fair and elegant.His hand holding the folding fan, his shallow smile\u2026Gentle, considerate, talented, and handsome young man. It seemed that the man of her dreams should be like this.Song Luan drank some wine since she was in a good mood. After a while, her cheeks and neck flushed red.When Zhao Nanyu finished talking about things, he saw her rolling on the bed with a smile on her face. When he came nearer, he could smell the wine on her.Song Luan wanted to sit upright, but her body didn\u2019t listen to her. Zhao Nanyu held her, so she could sit still.Song Luan moved to his side.She laughed foolishly and asked, \u201cWho was that man just now?\u201d\u201cHuh? Who?\u201dSong Luan\u2019s eyes turned disorderly, and her hands moved in the air. \u201cThe man in the side room just now. What\u2019s his name?\u201dIt\u2019s enough to know his name. If she had a chance to meet him in the future, maybe she could go up to say hello.After a long time without an answer, Song Luan became bolder and urged with impatience. \u201cI want to know!\u201dZhao Nanyu slowly fixed her messy clothes. He said with a smile, \u201cDo you think he looks good?\u201dSong Luan closed her eyes and nodded heavily, \u201cVery handsome!!!\u201dIn her dreams, there was a gentleman, holding her hand, and they would look at each other with smiles as sweet as honey\u2026Zhao Nanyu\u2019s five fingers gently inserted into her hair and sighed, \u201cYou should not be allowed to drink.\u201dWhenever she\u2019s drunk, she would always say these things he didn\u2019t like to hear.Song Luan tilted her head and fell on him. \u201cShhh,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you quietly, you can\u2019t tell Zhao Nanyu.\u201dHe said with a low smile, \u201cOkay, whatever you say.\u201d\u201cThat man is handsome. When he looked over here, I suddenly felt hot.\u201d Song Luan giggled, \u201cAlthough I knew clearly he couldn\u2019t see me at all.\u201dThat man she saw in the window\u2026This kind of heart was not loving, but just a momentary throbbing, the second shaking of god.Her face and ears were red, and her hands were trembling from excitement.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s chest was scratched out just from her few words. It felt like there was a big hole, and only blood continued to flow. He couldn\u2019t speak.The most terrible thing was that he still had a decent smile on his face.He looked down at the woman lying on his lap, her breathing almost calm. The warm light shone on Song Luan\u2019s porcelain white face.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hands gently covered Song Luan\u2019s eyes. If only she could see him alone.It turned out, Song Luan just won\u2019t like him.And her heart could throb for any other man.Zhao Nanyu was very calm while accepting this reality. His chest was empty, his eyes felt like there was acid. It was uncomfortable.He pinched Song Luan by the waist and threw her in the bed. He raised his hand to extinguish the candle fire and started ravaging her.Song Luan moved her body uncomfortably. \u201cYou\u2019re heavy, get up.\u201dZhao Nanyu clasped her hands against the top of the pillow, bent his head heavily on her clavicle, and bit a mark before releasing his mouth.His fingers slowly traced her rosy lips, and the half-awakened Song Luan suddenly opened her eyes. It was hazy, but after a hard blink, she gradually saw his face.Zhao Nanyu pinched her chin and lifted it upward. He bit her lips.Song Luan was expressionless, but her eyes were a little confused.Having a husband like this felt so uncomfortable? She thought, muddled.Zhao Nanyu saw her blank face, and his heart became cold.His hand movements were fiercer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerProofread by: MaryAunt Lin was seriously ill. Since the death of her daughter, the original bright and beautiful person had aged rapidly. She was not that old, but her white hair had grown more times. After pulling out one, another comes out.Aunt Lin never wore gold and silver anymore. She wore plain clothes every day. She originally did not believe in Buddhism, but now she had set up a small Buddha hall in her room. Even if her body and bones were not good, she had to get up from the bed and kneel in front of the Buddha and pray devoutly.Song Luan was the only child under her knees. Now that aunt Lin was seriously ill, only a few people had visited her. It was not surprising that Aunt Lin was shrewd and did not deal with other aunts of the Song family. The remaining children of the Song family were either married or young.Song Heqing came to see her twice. After his beloved sister passed away, he also lost a lot of weight. Although he had never shed tears in the eyes of outsiders, his sadness was real.He still couldn\u2019t believe that Zhao Nanyu would kill his sister. The man looked at his sister\u2019s eyes with love. He believed that Zhao Nanyu killed his sister because he still hated what his sister had done in the past to him.But now the Song family was no longer what it used to be, and even his father\u2019s life needed saving. He couldn\u2019t avenge his sister, otherwise, he must pay with his life against Zhao Nanyu.Aunt Lin was pale as she leaned against the back of the bed, coughing. \u201cHave you ever dreamt of Ah Luan?\u201dSong Heqing gave her a drink of water and shook his head. \u201cNever.\u201dAunt Lin then said, \u201cI dreamt of her, several times. She told me that it was cold below. She had nothing to eat, and nothing to wear that was warm. She was bullied every day. My daughter, who is golden, is so miserable. I don\u2019t want to live now. I just go down with her. I can protect her when I go down.\u201dAunt Lin still remembered Song Luan\u2019s appearance when she was just born. She was much more beautiful than the other children. She didn\u2019t cry or made any noise. She kept her eyes closed. Her little white flesh hands were pinched into two small fists, and her two feet were kicking around. It was very lovely.The doctor also told Song Heqing that if aunt Lin\u2019s pent up spirit was not untied, the disease wouldn\u2019t be cured.But Song Luan was dead, and Song Heqing couldn\u2019t find a way to cure her heart disease.However, words of consolation still had to be said.\u201cTake care of your body, only then can Ah Luan go with peace of mind.\u201dAunt Lin could not listen to any other words, nor could she find any hope to live on.Song Heqing clenched his teeth and said, \u201cIf you go like this, Ah Luan\u2019s hatred will be unrequited.\u201dThese words were just a motivation for her to live.Aunt Lin was also very clear on that matter, and she said with a sarcastic smile, \u201cI can\u2019t avenge my daughter even if I live.\u201dAunt Lin remembered how Zhao Nanyu was holding the corpse of her daughter and even refused to let anyone touch her. It wasn\u2019t enough for him to kill her daughter, and he even burned her daughter\u2019s body in a fire.The servant of the guard suddenly came to report, \u201cYoung master, that\u2026there\u2019s a Zhao family member who came to visit.\u201dAfter hearing this, aunt Lin looked grim and said, \u201cLet them go back! If they refuse, just beat them to death!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026but it\u2019s the young master Zhao Zhi who came here\u2026\u201dAunt Lin\u2019s face looked a little better. The Zhao family and the Song family had turned upside down a long time ago and had stopped contacting each other. Little Zhao never came to the Song family, so he was not familiar with the people here.With a strong breath, aunt Lin said slowly, \u201cBring the child in.\u201dHe came into the room without any expression and knelt on the edge of the bed. \u201cGreetings, Grandmother.\u201dAunt Lin looked at her grandchild who was half of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s blood. She had no good face and asked in a cold voice, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dLittle Zhao raised his clean face, his eyes were slightly red, \u201cMother did not want me, and grandmother also does not want me?\u201dHe was selling pity.Aunt Lin was soft-hearted, so her voice was not as cold as before. After a little calming down, she said, \u201cIf you still want to come to the Song family in the future, no one will stop you.\u201dLooking at this child with a face similar to Zhao Nanyu, no matter how soft she was, she couldn\u2019t say any more good words.With his head and eyes drooping, he murmured, \u201cMy father is going to marry another woman.\u201dAunt Lin almost couldn\u2019t breathe and squeezed her hand tightly. \u201cWhat?! How dare he\u2026\u201dHow long had Ah Luan been dead?! Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t wait to take wild hooves home. Maybe he was afraid that if Ah Luan was still alive, they couldn\u2019t get together!Little Zhao\u2019s black eyes were still staring at the carpet. No one could see what he was thinking.He just wanted that woman to die.He only had one mother.Knowing that he was too young to kill the woman on his own, he came to find his grandmother.At a young age, he could use a knife to kill a person.He hated the woman in his father\u2019s arms. Even though he couldn\u2019t see her, he saw how his father hid her so well. He must like her very much.Little Zhao kneeled on the ground, and silently shed tears.Aunt Lin was so angry that she said, \u201cWell, Zhao Nanyu deceives so many people.\u201dShe looked at his eyes and gritted her teeth and said, \u201cYour father is really good at it.\u201dSong Heqing was afraid that she would say inappropriate words in front of the child. No matter what Zhao Nanyu was like, this child was innocent and pitiful.If he knew that his mother was killed by his father, he would never be happy in his life.He took little Zhao in his arms, touched his face, and sighed, \u201cNo one will not want you. If you are not happy, you can come to play with your uncle. Your father will not say anything if he knows.\u201dHe nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dAunt Lin was so angry that she hated Zhao Nanyu in her heart. In front of the child, she said, \u201cWhat else can\u2019t your father do? Huh? He even stabbed your mother to death.\u201dBefore, little Zhao\u2019s tears were disguised, but after hearing her words, he cried, and a slap of tears rolled down one by one and fell on his sleeves.Song Heqing wrung his eyebrows and said to Aunt Lin, \u201cKeep your mouth shut!\u201d\u201cAm I wrong? Can\u2019t he listen!? When he grows up in the future, he won\u2019t know anything. Maybe he will complain about Ah Luan! What can\u2019t be said? Zhao Nanyu dares to do it, but we need to be afraid of saying this?! What a joke!\u201d Aunt Lin laughed as if she had gone mad.Song Heqing had no choice but to take little Zhao out first.After this, aunt Lin started to drink medicine.She was stimulated.After little Zhao came home, he began to lose his temper, refused to have a proper meal, and even threw things.When the housekeeper reported this, Song Luan listened quietly. She clenched the chopsticks in her hand, and her heart leaped up and down.Zhao Nanyu got up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and have a look.\u201dSong Luan grabbed his arm and looked at him eagerly, \u201cI want to go too.\u201dZhao Nanyu touched her face affectionately, \u201cIt\u2019s not the time yet.\u201dHe used these words to send her away from little Zhao these past two days.Song Luan thought that Zhao Nanyu wanted her to give in and watch her willingly stay with her. She had to live in his humble circle for him to be satisfied.Looking at Zhao Nanyu\u2019s back, Song Luan thought silently that all the words in that man\u2019s mouth were all bullshit. She shouldn\u2019t believe a word.Zhao Nanyu said that she would not be under his custody, but when she woke up from a hangover that day, she had a mute servant girl placed close to her.At first, Song Luan thought it was Zhao Nanyu who ordered her not to talk to her. Later, she realized that her tongue was pulled out.Song Luan felt a chill in her heart, even a little afraid. She felt very painful just thinking about this matter. However, it was not Zhao Nanyu who did it himself. He would not harm a servant girl by his own hands.Most of the time whenever he says something, the people at the bottom would follow his orders.Song Luan didn\u2019t know sign language, and the little maid didn\u2019t know how to read, so they couldn\u2019t communicate at all.Song Luan asked the housekeeper why her servant girl\u2019s tongue was pulled out?The housekeeper replied, \u201cShe made a mistake before, and the master pulled out her tongue and sold it.\u201d The servant looked at her pitifully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like her, I will change her immediately.\u201dSong Luan waved her hand. \u201cNo need.\u201dEven if she changed a servant, the next one would also be mute.Song Luan couldn\u2019t figure out how Zhao Nanyu blackened so much. She was the only one who was in pain! His road to success was even more smooth than the original book.She was lying in bed, while looking down at the love marks Zhao Nanyu left, and sighed.Although Zhao Nanyu was not clear-minded before, he was indeed much better than now.He was a beast in bed.Song Luan couldn\u2019t remember exactly what she said that night, but she could guess that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t like to hear it, because later when he got up, his face was not very good-looking.Song Luan didn\u2019t plan to go against Zhao Nanyu anymore. Her arms and thighs were twisted, and she gave in.When Zhao Nanyu came by, the child\u2019s eyes were swollen. He seemed to have cried.He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Refusing to eat is the most childish means, you are not an ignorant child.\u201dLittle Zhao looked up and his eyes were still. He looked like Song Luan when she looked at him.\u201cDid you really kill mother?\u201dLittle Zhao only remembered that after talking to his mother that day, she was already gone.He didn\u2019t believe it, but he didn\u2019t think his grandmother would lie to him on such things.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s long finger knocked on the table unintentionally, and he slowly opened his mouth, \u201cWho did you hear this from?\u201dHe said, \u201cSomeone told me.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes flashed a cold light in his eyes and sneered. He ordered his guards outside, \u201cGo and find out who chewed his tongue in front of the young master and kill him.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to check. My grandmother told me that. Are you going to kill her?\u201dAfter a long silence, Zhao Nanyu only said, \u201cYour mother will come back.\u201dThe servant ran from side to side, his legs were almost broken, his mouth was dry and his voice choked a bit. \u201cMy Lord, Madam said that she had a stomachache and asked you to hurry back.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked at his son and said before he left, \u201cEat well. Don\u2019t mess around.\u201dSimple eight words, but there was an edge of anger.The hatred in the black eyes of little Zhao deepened a lot. Now he wanted to kill the woman who was hidden.She deserved to be called \u2018Madam\u2019?His father\u2019s favorite person should be his mother, but now she could easily call his father away with a casual word.Little Zhao\u2019s eyes dropped. He was silent as he thought that he would certainly kill her.***Song Luan waited anxiously for a long time for Zhao Nanyu to come back. Little Zhao refused to eat, Zhao Nanyu would certainly punish him heavily. She called him back, so he would not be punished.After a while, there was a footstep outside the house.Song Luan immediately laid on the bed, pretending to grunt twice.Zhao Nanyu approached and saw through her disguise at a glance. Instead of exposing her, he asked, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201dSong Luan covered her stomach and nodded, \u201cIt hurts.\u201dZhao Nanyu sat down beside her. The sun was shining on his porcelain white face. His facial features were straight. There was a shallow smile in the deep of his eyebrows. He put his palm on her abdomen and rubbed it gently.\u201cBetter?\u201dSong Luan was rubbed by him and was about to fall asleep. She replied, \u201cMuch better.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s hand continued to rub her stomach and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. I\u2019ll let the kitchen make painkillers for you. You must drink it all in a moment.\u201dSong Luan frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want to drink.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t do anything because after the medicine was cooked, it was directly sent in front of her.Song Luan covered her nose and drank most of the bowl. After drinking, there was no sweet candy offered to her.She had a bitter face\u2026 Zhao Nanyu must have seen her act and was deliberately correcting her.Song Luan raised her eyes and looked at him seriously. She said, \u201cZhao Nanyu, bring little Zhao to me.\u201dZhao Nanyu murmured.Song Luan felt that he was perfunctory, but she still had a bitter taste in her mouth. Then she said, \u201cLet\u2019s live a good life. I\u2019ll stay by your side and I won\u2019t run away. I\u2019ll be very obedient.\u201dAfter hearing this, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mouth rose slightly, but the smile was a little ugly, \u201cAh Luan, do you like me?\u201dSong Luan opened her mouth and was ready to say \u2018like\u2019. However, her throat seemed to be choked, and could not spit out the two words.She tried to say it, but couldn\u2019t make a sound. It was as if someone was pinching her by the throat.The radian of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mouth dropped slowly. He raised his hand to touch her lips and whispered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak?\u201dHe just wanted her to like him, too.Song Luan was stunned, puzzled, confused, and was at loss.Her heart won\u2019t throb towards Zhao Nanyu. His face was clearly what she liked, but now the feeling of blushing and heartbeat didn\u2019t happen.Song Luan was even a little confused. Why was he so persistent in these words? She had said she won\u2019t run. Was there anything else she needed to do?Zhao Nanyu imprinted a kiss on her lips, looking at her ignorant eyes, heartbroken.Song Luan felt that he seemed very sad. Every time Zhao Nanyu kisses her, her mood would become very good, but this time it seems different.Song Luan herself was aware of her heart. It was as it would never beat for him.Song Luan stood on tiptoe and put her arm around his neck. She also gave him a heavy kiss on the corner of his mouth.That\u2019s it.Zhao Nanyu won\u2019t force her to say she liked him.No worries after a kiss.Her kisses were sweet and delicious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerT/N: Zhao Nanyu will remember all of his three lifetimes with Song Luan in this chapter. Don\u2019t be confused.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s chest seemed to be pierced by a sharp sword, all his limbs were cold, and his eyes were tinged red like blood. He covered his chest, and his other hand was strongly holding the edge of the bed. His throat tasted fishy. He couldn\u2019t resist the bloody breath out of his throat, and he spat out blood instantaneously.Song Luan was so shocked. She helped him hurriedly as she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201dZhao Nan took a look at her, the corners of his lips wriggled, but he fainted before he could say anything.When he opened his eyes, his face was already covered with blood. There were fierce fighting sounds in his ears. Soldiers with swords were constantly fighting around him.\u201cKill!\u201d The general\u2019s armor was covered with blood, so he couldn\u2019t see his appearance.Zhao Nanyu found that he couldn\u2019t control his body. He could only watch himself lift the sword and cut off the head of the man on his side. The vice general behind him widened his eyes in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2026you betrayed the Lord!? You joined the rebels!\u201dWith a sneer, he raised his sword and pierced the vice general\u2019s heart. His eyes were cold as he said, \u201cOpen the city gate.\u201dThe nearly ten thousand pro-army soldiers that were stationed in the capital had been under his command for a long time. His attendants immediately opened the gate of the city. A crowd of soldiers with red eyes rushed in and killed people to the imperial palace.The man was dressed in black. His pale face was splashed with fresh blood. He was murderous. He held the hilt in his hand, and the sharp blade slowly crossed the ground. His eyes looked coldly at the people in the city tower.Since the emperor was in power, the troops guarding the imperial palace didn\u2019t have a strong foothold. The commander of the guard army and the king of southwest who rebelled against the army were enemies.Even if the commander surrendered today, his future would be extremely bleak, so he took the fare-faced princess to the tower, tied her hands tightly, and whispered in her ear, \u201cI have wronged you.\u201dThe princess and her husband (southwest prince) had been married for many years and their feelings were like honey. If there was an instance that a ruthless son of the world could be merciless, it could only be regarding the little princess\u2019 matters.The commander didn\u2019t want to kill the little princess. He just wanted to save his life.He said to the people below in a loud voice, \u201cIf you dare to go one step further, I will kill her.\u201dThe knife across the little princess\u2019s neck advanced a few points.With a smile on the southwest\u2019s young prince\u2019s lips, he asked his attendants for a bow and arrow. He raised his hand, aiming at the woman in red on the wall.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes widened, and he saw his other self with his own eyes. Without hesitation, he shot the arrow out. His posture was perfect.Most of the people didn\u2019t expect that the son of the southwest king, who had always loved his wife, would be so cruel and merciless that he shot his wife without hesitation.The little princess was pushed down from the city tower by the arrow, and her body continued to fall. With a bang, she landed heavily, and her trickling blood flowed out of her head.Zhao Nanyu looked at the face that was exactly like Song Luan, and towards himself who killed her with an arrow with his own hands. He shouted, \u201cNo!\u201dExcluding himself, no one else heard him.Without even looking at his wife\u2019s body, he said to the soldiers behind him, \u201cI killed for the glory of all.\u201dHe was the most beloved son of the southwest king and the most popular son of the southwest frontier. He had a great cause and would never be hindered by small love.After all, the guards could not resist the pressure of the army.The golden city had become a purgatory, full of corpses. Every place seemed to have been washed by the blood, even the heavy rain could not wash it away.The blood on his face had already condensed into deep red, and his cold aura was ruthlessly rampant. He had murderous eyes, so the deputy commander hesitated to talk to him.He glanced at him coldly, \u201cIf you have anything to say, just say it.\u201d\u201cThe princess\u2019 body\u2026is still at the ground of the tower\u2026what to do with\u2026\u201dFor so many years, they were considered a golden couple that could rival the gods and goddesses.An innocent and kind-hearted princess with a gentle and handsome prince. They never quarreled, and there was love everywhere.Before the southwest king rebelled, he was also worried whether his beloved son would be exhausted by his love affair.But what he did was beyond the imagination of the southwest king.However this was good, it wasn\u2019t good for a prince to be weak.His son had the correct mindset. It was only right that this should be given to him.The corners of his lips narrowed into a straight line, and his face suddenly looked ugly. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and have a look at the body myself.\u201dThe rainstorm began to rest, and only a drizzle came down.The little princess laid on the ground quietly with her eyes closed. Her beautiful face, hair, and hands were covered with blood.She was dressed in a finely embroidered wedding dress that she seemed to have made for herself, just like the day she married him.The southwest prince still remembered that on the day she married him, she wore this dress with a sweet smile on her face, her cheeks and ears were flushed red, and her hands were tensely holding on to her sleeve.Her heart was afraid of death but still pretended to be very strong and powerful.She said, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. I\u2019m my father\u2019s favorite daughter. If you don\u2019t treat me well, I\u2019ll let him kill you.\u201d\u201cThe princess is so fierce.\u201dThe little princess was teased red by his words, so she turned around, and hummed with arrogance, \u201cYou\u2019re good to be afraid. I dare you to bully me. I\u2019m a real gold branch and jade leaf!\u201dShe was pampered and was born to be spoiled.It\u2019s a little girl who grew up in the hands of the emperor and queen. She had no idea.Over the years, he did like her.However, even if she was not killed today, the overall situation would make the little princess hate him all her life.Let her go clean like this.It\u2019s also a good thing.The identity of the former princess was a curse. Zhao Nanyu knew that she would never wrong him, so it would be better if she died.It was better if he sent her off than her dying in someone else\u2019s hands.He squatted down, and his dark eyes stared at her lifeless body. The arrow was still stuck in the chest of the little princess. He raised his hand and pulled it out.The rain made her face wet. He looked at her for a long time.He straightened up slowly, turned his back, and closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll bury you in Dingling tomb. After a hundred years, I\u2019ll be buried with you.\u201dZhao Nanyu looked at this scene while feeling numb in his body. He couldn\u2019t believe how he could do this to her.He loved Song Luan so much that he couldn\u2019t bear to see her hurt and sad. How could he kill her?As soon as the picture turned, Zhao Nanyu saw Song Luan again. She became his wife again, but with a disdainful smile on her face and a sarcastic look in her eyes.Song Luan seemed to hate him very much, and even refused to say a word more.And he didn\u2019t like his wife very much.The two hadn\u2019t seen each other for three months, it was the longest time. He had a residence outside Zhao\u2019s family residence, so whenever he didn\u2019t want to go back to Zhao\u2019s residence, he would stay outside.Song Luan\u2019s disgust for him was utterly obvious. She refused to speak well every time she was called. Her words were sharp and she never gave up half a word.Not only that, Song Luan attracted other men, constantly provoking them, but never looked at Zhao Nanyu.She even wanted to leave him for other men. Zhao Nanyu finally couldn\u2019t help but poison her.Before Song Luan\u2019s death, he went to see her in a good mood. After being tortured by poison for several years, she was as thin as wood and even had no strength to get up.Zhao Nanyu saw that he took out the dagger and pierced it into her heart with a sneer. The dagger was dirtied with her blood, so he threw the dagger and wiped his fingers with a handkerchief.He poured oil on the outside of her room. The fire reflected his indifferent face. He laughed as he threw the fire torch on the ground.The fire quickly became fierce, and it burned her clean.Zhao Nanyu couldn\u2019t tell whether this was real or a dream. He couldn\u2019t believe he killed her again.Seeing Song Luan\u2019s death again, Zhao Nanyu could no longer feel the pain.His eyes were scarlet red as he looked at the burning house with no regrets of killing his wife.\u2026Then, Zhao Nanyu saw the scene of him tremblingly killing Song Luan, who was in great pain.He held Song Luan in his arms, his hands quivering, and a few tears streaked on his cheek. Even though his heart was like a knife, he killed Song Luan because he couldn\u2019t bear to see her in pain.This was the third time.For every three times, it seemed that his heart was gouged out.Suddenly a strange man appeared in front of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s sight. He was wearing a Taoist robe, and his mouth was smiling. \u201cYou remember it all.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s face was pale, and his throat was sour, he couldn\u2019t make any sound.The young man smiled slightly, \u201cDo you remember what the princess said before she died?\u201dHe saw that she seemed to have said a word before she was pierced, but he didn\u2019t hear it.The handsome Taoist kindly reminded him, \u201cThe little princess said that she never wanted to meet you again. If she met you, she would never fall in love with you.\u201d\u201cIf she falls in love, she wouldn\u2019t die easily.\u201dThis was her punishment for herself, for being ignorant.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s face completely lost its blood color, his lips turned pale, and his voice was ethereal, \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cAnd after you have accomplished your cause, you want to be with her in the next life.\u201d The Taoist said with a smile, \u201cYou are so stubborn that you have indeed won her again in the next life.\u201dBut this time, it was not easy for her to die.Zhao Nanyu strained his back, and his heart ached so much that he could not stand.The Taoist continued, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to see you continue to torture each other, so I helped you.\u201d\u201cShe will never fall in love with you. Maybe she will fall in love with other men, but she will never treat you with the love that a man and woman have. As long as she does not love you, she will never end up in a bad end.\u201dTherefore, if Zhao Nanyu wanted her for a long time, he couldn\u2019t be delusional and wished for her to like him.This was also his retribution.Several generations of retribution.Love and gain could never stand together.And he had to worry whether Song Luan would like other men for the rest of his life.Every time Zhao Nanyu killed her, he could recognize her\u2013the lover he had been looking for a long time.Only after killing her could Zhao Nanyu remember everything.***Song Luan stayed in front of the bed, and after a while, she yawned. She was sleepy, but she couldn\u2019t fall asleep even if she was.Zhao Nanyu hadn\u2019t woken up yet. He murmured words, but she couldn\u2019t hear clearly what he was saying.The doctors were slow to come. They arrived in the middle of the night.The doctor rushed to the house with the medical box. After probing his pulse, he said, \u201cMadam, he just fainted. He will wake up after taking the medicine.\u201dThat\u2019s it!?Song Luan didn\u2019t believe it. She pointed to the man who was still unconscious in the bed, and said, \u201cBut he vomited blood.\u201dThe doctor shook his head and said, \u201cIt should not be.\u201dHe coughed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he was so angry that he vomited blood.\u201dSong Luan didn\u2019t know much about this either, so she nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give him the decoction.\u201dNo one dares to give her such rough work, so the servant girl cooked the medicine for her and brought it in.Song Luan blew the medicine cold and sent it to Zhao Nanyu\u2019s mouth. However, the man was in a coma, so she struggled to feed him.He even vomited the medicine out.Song Luan lost her patience after feeding him once or twice. She placed the medicine aside and pinched his face. \u201cYou drink this medicine or not.\u201dWas it because she didn\u2019t say she liked him? He vomited blood to scare her.She wanted to say she liked him, but she couldn\u2019t make a sound.Song Luan thought about this messed up thing. She fought with her eyelids and finally fell asleep on the edge of the bed.***Suddenly, Zhao Nanyu opened his eyes and turned around. He found Song Luan was lying sound asleep on him.Zhao Nanyu thought of all the evils he had done before.He killed his wife himself for the sake of the emperor.In order not to be shackled by love, he got rid of the person he loved.He did get the throne, and also the boundless loneliness.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s throat still had a musty smell. He coughed twice. Although the voice was very low, he still woke up the woman lying on him.Song Luan opened her eyes vaguely and said, \u201cYou are awake.\u201dZhao Nanyu startled her today. He was unconscious for a while after vomiting blood, and even after inviting the doctor to see him, he still did not wake up.Song Luan tried to give him medicine on the way, but she couldn\u2019t feed him. There was also no response from him.Song Luan was afraid that he would die, and that big mouthful of blood he spat out scared out her three spirits and six spirits.In her eyes, Zhao Nanyu was a strong man who wouldn\u2019t get hurt.What\u2019s the matter! He kissed her and spat blood after? Then she won\u2019t kiss him again.Zhao Nanyu slowly sat up, and his eyes were dark. He suddenly grabbed her wrist and chuckled in a low voice. His laughter sounded a bit grim.Song Luan looked at him and felt that he was crazier.She touched his forehead, a little worried about him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Are you still sick?\u201dZhao Nanyu looked at her, who didn\u2019t remember anything. He laughed and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dJust after finishing these three words, he vomited out a mouthful of blood.Song Luan hurriedly found a handkerchief and wiped the blood from the corners of his lips. \u201cYou\u2026What the hell is going on!\u201dHow angry he was that he vomits blood at every turn!Zhao Nanyu threw up because he couldn\u2019t bear the chest pain.He had been in hell. Although they were entangled for such a long time, Zhao Nanyu did not intend to let Song Luan go.Song Luan belongs to him.She could only belong to him.If Song Luan falls in love with other men in the future, whether it\u2019s the scholar who visited earlier or an elegant young talent, Zhao Nanyu wouldn\u2019t resist the desire to kill them just by thinking about it.Song Luan was wearing a single dress, her collar was slightly open, and her white shoulder was half exposed. She looked ignorant and innocent.Zhao Nanyu hugged her, and his eyes were gloomy, \u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201dYou can\u2019t go.You can\u2019t fall in love with others.You can\u2019t leave me.Zhao Nanyu did not want to kill her again and again, and then live in endless pain.Song Luan was pinched a little bit by him, \u201cYou are not in a good mood.\u201dThe male lead was amazing.Whenever he was in a bad mood, he bullied her.So angry.Zhao Nanyu laughed and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not very good.\u201dIn the end, Song Luan\u2019s mood was not very good either. Zhao Nanyu, who was ill, was very brave and energetic enough to make her soft.Her waist was broken and her legs were tightly tied around his waist.The strength to cry was gone.Zhao Nanyu lowered his head, sucked the tears from the corner of her eyes, and pinched her waist. The only phrase that lingered around his ears was:\u00a0\u201cshe will remember.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s fingers combed through her hair, and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cMy favorite person is you.\u201d\u201cI will love you very much.\u201dSong Luan, who was already in a dream, could not hear these words.The woman in his arms shrank and murmured twice. He stretched out his arms and held her neck tightly.He rubbed her body and licked her lips. \u201cAh, you are so warm.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The content accuracy is not guranteed.Translated by: TinkerSong Luan could remember some things, which were all in her dreams. It was both intermittent and long, but every time she woke up, she couldn\u2019t remember very clearly, and her brain would hurt after thinking too much. As time went by, Song Luan was not willing to continue to think about it.Song Luan was a little dependent on Zhao Nanyu. It was cold in late autumn. She always hugged him at night, and her whole body arched into his arms to get some warm heat.As long as Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t force her to say that she likes him, Song Luan felt that she could live like this.However, Song Luan noticed Zhao Nanyu\u2019s restraint these days. He didn\u2019t talk much these days. So, they often had nothing to say together.Song Luan couldn\u2019t tell whether this was a world in a book. It didn\u2019t matter if it was. She couldn\u2019t go back to modern times.After becoming a powerful official in the book, Zhao Nanyu only cared about power and was not very interested in women. He would return from the palace very late every day, and would not say even a few words with the original female lead.Song Luan felt that she hadn\u2019t seen a man other than Zhao Nanyu for a long time. Before, there would have been his counselors or students visiting the residence to talk about things.Song Luan still remembered the elegant and handsome scholar who she saw by the window that day.After he vomited blood that time, Zhao Nanyu\u2019s time with her in the room had become longer. He hugged her all day long, and his fear of long absence even reached into Song Luan\u2019s mind. She felt that Zhao Nanyu\u2019s possessiveness had reached its peak, and was even reluctant to let her leave him for half a step.Zhao Nanyu had already agreed to let her see little Zhao, but with a condition, he would teach her to write well.Song Luan couldn\u2019t understand the complicated font of the dynasty. They were as difficult to understand as the seal script, and they were very complicated to write. She only recognized the simple ones, and she only read picture books with few words.Therefore, Song Luan still had a headache when practicing calligraphy.However, Zhao Nanyu, who stood by the window to write and read a book, looked like he was enjoying himself. The windowpane was propped up, and the golden sun rushed to sprinkle on his bright face. He was wearing a crescent colored robe, with a jade crown and hair, delicate features, and a blue sachet tied around his waist.This sachet was embroidered by Song Luan, and her embroidery work was in a mess. Naturally, the sachet was not very good. When Zhao Nanyu took it out to wear it, she lost her temper and said that she would lose his face, but he did not care.Zhao Nanyu raised his face and waved to her, \u201cCome here, I\u2019ll teach you how to write.\u201dSong Luan ran to his side and was held in his arms. His broad and warm palms tightly wrapped her small hands and taught her to write one by one.Song Luan turned her face slightly and asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this word?\u201dInstead of answering, Zhao Nanyu asked her, \u201cDo you remember how to write it?\u201dSong Luan shook her head and replied truthfully, \u201cNo.\u201dOnly once, how could she remember?In a trance, Song Luan always felt that this was the first time they had such a quiet leisure time before. He taught her to practice calligraphy hand by hand. And he would smile calmly towards her even though she did not know what she said to him.On second thought, it seemed to be her imagination again.Zhao Nanyu took the trouble to teach her over and over again. He was very patient. Song Luan\u2019s wrist was sour and wanted to drop her pen and say no more.But whenever she thought of her son, her temper would be pressed down.In this short time, Zhao Nanyu taught her less than ten words. She was very ashamed that she didn\u2019t recognize any of them.Zhao Nanyu was a strict teacher when teaching people how to read characters. If she didn\u2019t write correctly, he would beat her palm with a ruler.Although the strength was like scratching, Song Luan still felt very ashamed, so she complained in tears that he bullied her.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cWhat kind of bullying is this.\u201dSong Luan put her slightly red palm in front of his eyes. \u201cYou see, my hands are swollen.\u201dZhao Nanyu pursed his lips and chuckled. He took her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll find you some ointment to apply on.\u201d\u2026After applying for medicine, Song Luan was still not satisfied. Her cheeks were full of anger.Zhao Nanyu handed her the ruler to her. \u201cYou can beat me with a ruler, if that will relieve you.\u201dSong Luan took the ruler and hit him twice in the palm of his hand. She didn\u2019t dare to use her strength, nor dare to take an inch.The two people made a fool of themselves and went to bed right after. Song Luan didn\u2019t know what happened later, but when she came back to her senses, she had already been thrown into bed.The strong and fierce man was extremely energetic, and Zhao Nanyu was particularly keen on this activity these days.Song Luan\u2019s belt was thrown on the floor. Her long hair was also scattered, her cherry mouth slightly open, and her chest heaved up and down.Her sweat continued to trickle down her forehead, and her white and small ears were slightly red.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hands were on her two sides, his deep eyes that resembled the inner depths of the cold pool were staring right through her.Song Luan felt that he was trying to eat her. She covered her chest with hindsight and said, \u201cYou need to put on a light face on broad day light.\u201dZhao Nanyu nodded and threw his belt out of the bed. Song Luan pulled his hand to keep him from moving. She played coquetry with him with sweet words, \u201cLord Zhao, this is harmful to your body, you should be a little bit more restrained.\u201dZhao Nanyu\u2019s hand slowly moved down to her abdomen. His warm palms caressed her, as he chuckled softly. He almost bit her earlobe and said, \u201cLuan Bao, let\u2019s have another child.\u201dSong Luan was called \u2018Luan Bao\u2019 and her whole body became soft. Soft and sweet words like honey could come out from his mouth.It turned out that Zhao Nanyu wanted a child.But Song Luan still couldn\u2019t forget the pain she had when she had a miscarriage. The overwhelming despair made her unable to breathe.Song Luan shrank back in a small voice, \u201cI\u2019m a little scared.\u201dZhao Nanyu felt pain in his heart. He kissed her lips with pity and said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. I won\u2019t hurt you this time. Let\u2019s have a child.\u201dShe was in good health and well-being, and it would never happen to her again.Every time Zhao Nanyu recalled her pale body lying in his arms, and his palms covered with her blood, he would feel pain.All the sins he had done today and before, he couldn\u2019t blame others for it. He could only blame himself for his lack of heart.Song Luan bit her lips and bowed her head without saying anything. She was still unwilling.Zhao Nanyu said with a smile, \u201cMaybe you already have our child in your stomach now.\u201dA long time of hard work would always be rewarding.Song Luan stared at him and said seriously, \u201cYou don\u2019t like children so much.\u201d\u201cThe child depends on the mother. As long as it is born by you, I will like it very much.\u201dSong Luan covered his mouth and snickered, \u201cYou can say love words.\u201dHe used to scare and threaten her.From the evening until it was completely dark, soft moans came and went. The maid who was guarding the door blushed and her heartbeat fast.For several days and nights, the beautiful girl in the room had been tossed about like this. No one knew how her small size could tolerate such strenuous activity. It\u2019s really hard for her.After a long time, the candlelight in the room was lit. The man put on a coat and opened the door. His expression was slightly cold, as he ordered,\u00a0 \u201cPrepare water.\u201dThe servant went to the kitchen and carried the hot water to their room.Song Luan, who was served by Zhao Nanyu, leaned in the tub with her eyes closed. She didn\u2019t have to do anything.After bathing, he wiped her dry. He took her clean clothes and put them back on the bed, and tucked in the quilt corners for her.If one day, Song Luan also remembered the past, she would hate him.For the first time, he killed her for the sake of the country.Zhao Nanyu\u2019s hand was on her waist. Song Luan habitually drilled into his chest, her small head in his arms, her limbs on his body, as murmured in her sleep, \u201cAh, I want to eat sugar gourd.\u201d***As soon as the light of day broke, little Zhao was called by his father.Zhao Nanyu looked at the child whose height was already on his waist. His heart softened. \u201cYou\u2019ll see your mother in a moment.\u201dLittle Zhao thought that his father was forcing him to recognize the woman as his mother. He lowered his head and felt lifeless. \u201cThis son knows.\u201dSoon after, he was finally led to the courtyard where he was never allowed to venture.Little Zhao was standing outside the gate of the courtyard.The servant girl behind him urged, \u201cYoung master, please hurry in.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d The tone was low, young, and majestic. The coldness radiating out from his body made people respect him.Little Zhao looked at the courtyard carefully and sneered twice. The hatred in his heart became deeper and deeper. The yard was almost the same as the place where his mother lived before.The garden was also planted with flowers that his mother loved.Little Zhao raised his small face, his footstep was slow as he walked to the door. He didn\u2019t wait for a reply when he pushed the door from the outside. Since the servant girl was scolded once, she dared not open her mouth to urge him a second time.Song Luan who was in the room felt inexplicably nervous as she walked around the table. Today, she wore a pink short skirt with light make-up. She looked very elegant.Little Zhao stood for a long time and finally walked into the room expressionlessly.He had made up his mind that he would never give any face to the people in the house today.Before he came, grandma Lin had advised him to be more polite to the new wife. She was beloved by his father that she could blow a deaf ear in front of his father, and it could probably cause the father and son to be separated from each other.But the new wife would have a baby sooner or later, and his status would fall by then.Little Zhao laughed instead, his eyebrows rose,\u00a0 \u201cWhy is she so worthy?\u201dThis was something.Grandma Lin sent him out of the door with worried eyes.The room was very quiet, he could hear the sound of his footsteps.The woman was sitting by the window, her feet hanging in the air, and her embroidered shoes were swaying in the air. Her back faced him, her long hair spread on her back, and only her side face could be seen in the dim light.Even if it was only half her face, it was enough for little Zhao to recognize her.The child was frozen in place, motionless, and his eyes were filled with water and his cheeks were stained wet with tears.He couldn\u2019t say clearly, \u201cMother, mother?\u201dSong Luan turned around, her heart beating like a drum. She took a deep breath, and she gradually relaxed. She put on a bright smile in front of little Zhao, \u201cWell, it\u2019s mother.\u201dShe then said, \u201cIt has been a long time, did you miss me?\u201dYes, of course.Sometimes he would cry secretly in bed.In front of his mother, he was only a fragile child. He often shed tears, felt wronged, and was even afraid.His eyes were red, as he ran to his mother\u2019s side, abandoning shyness. He tightly hugged her legs, crying out to the point he was breathless.Song Luan embraced his back and gently coaxed him, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Your mother is back.\u201dEven when Zhao Nanyu entered the room, he still couldn\u2019t stop crying. His eyes were red and swollen, his cheeks were moist, and he was still hiccuping.There was a smile in the corner of Zhao Nanyu\u2019s eyes as if he was laughing at his son.Song Luan held his son in her lap and looked at Zhao Nanyu. \u201cWhat do you have in your hand?\u201d\u201cSugar gourd.\u201d He added, \u201cHere you are.\u201dSong Luan swallowed. She really wanted to eat sugar gourd these two days. She reached out to him impolitely, \u201cSince it\u2019s for me, please give it to me.\u201dHer son was crying. Since she and her son was half in one, it would be fine to share it with him!Zhao Nanyu raised his eyebrows and laughed, \u201cYou are only allowed to eat it yourself, and the rest are not allowed to eat it.\u201dNeither could their son.Except for himself, of course.Song Luan smashed her mouth and said, \u201cI know, stingy.\u201dShe took a small bite. It was a little sour, but she liked it!Sour flavors were the best!After eating one, she lowered her head and asked her son, \u201cYou like to have a taste? It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want it. You can eat it.\u201dSong Luan ate two more in one breath. Later he realized that there was still a big man standing in front of her.Since he bought it, It was not good not to give him a taste.Song Luan pretended to pass the sugar gourd in front of him, \u201cWhat about you? Would you like a taste?\u201dShe remembered that Zhao Nanyu didn\u2019t like to eat these snacks, either it was too sweet or too sour.Unexpectedly, he nodded.He stooped slightly, took another bite on the sugar gourd she had bitten, tasted it carefully and swallowed it down his throat.Song Luan blinked. Ah, she asked curiously, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that it\u2019s sour?\u201dZhao Nanyu was still in the mood. \u201cIt\u2019s not sour, but it\u2019s sweet. \u201cSweet fart, she hadn\u2019t tasted the sweet part yet!After a long time, Song Luan realized that the one he ate was bitten by her.Hey, talk about hygiene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
