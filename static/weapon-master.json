    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: 1Chapter 1 - Nine Yang Divine Furnace\"So unlucky. This brat was too unlucky, dying in a few breaths.\"\"Brother Hong, are you really alright?\" \"He's Eldest Uncle's son after all, if Eldest Uncle finds out \u2026\"\"He is just an illegitimate child. What is there to be afraid of? Besides, who knows that it was us who did it? Go! Go! \"Hurry up and leave this damned place!\"\"\u2026\"Suddenly, Tang Huan seemed to hear a wave of cursing voices, and following that, what entered his ears was the sound of chaotic footsteps that were gradually disappearing in the distance.\"Uncle?\" An illegitimate child? \"These words flashed across his mind blurrily. Tang Huan suddenly quivered and suddenly woke up, flipping over to sit up, \"I'm actually still alive?\"Tang Huan subconsciously looked at it in the blink of an eye and was stunned.Surrounding him was a dark wall made of wooden planks, hung with sabers, spears, swords, sticks, and other weapons of all kinds. On one side of the shed, there was something similar to a stove, bellows, and a metal block, and beside the block, several large and small iron hammers were placed haphazardly.Tang Huan could immediately tell that this was a blacksmith shop.\"I did pass out while forging a sword in the workshop. If I was saved by someone, I would wake up in a hospital instead of my home. How could I appear in such a smithy?\"Tang Huan couldn't help but think back to that scene, but his head was in so much pain that it seemed like it was going to explode. In that instant, countless information quickly surfaced in his mind.\"En!\"With a groan, Tang Huan could not help but hold his head tightly, his face slowly turning pale white.After an unknown period of time, Tang Huan's expression finally improved, but as if he had seen a ghost, his eyes opened wide, his mouth slightly open, and his face was filled with disbelief.\"Glory Continent?\"After a long while, Tang Huan finally regained his senses and mumbled in disbelief.He was originally a Sword Craftsman, and was already renowned throughout the world before he was even thirty years old. He was able to craft every sword by hand, and the price of each sword was over a million.However, Tang Huan was not satisfied. He wanted to refine a peerless famous sword like the Ancient Fish Intestine and Great Ravine.As a result, he started to continuously look through various ancient books and research ancient methods, such as the Sword Refine Art. His hard work paid off, and in the end, he really did find a Sword Refine Furnace and a strange method of forging swords.Tang Huan immediately tried as though he had obtained a treasure.At the beginning, everything went smoothly, but as the treasured sword was about to be drawn, an accident happened.According to the method of forging the sword, one would have to obtain the blood of the Sword Craftsman as a guide, in order for the sword to have its true spirit, and not just an ice-cold weapon.Tang Huan would naturally not be stingy with his blood.However, what he did not expect was that when he dripped his own blood into the furnace, the Sword Refine Furnace was actually like a hungry wolf, desperately trying to obtain his blood.Not long after, Tang Huan completely fainted.When he woke up, he had actually come to this place called Glory Continent. Moreover, there was another person's memories in his head.The person in his memories was also called Tang Huan, and at the age of sixteen, he was the's illegitimate child.His mother, who was originally a servant of the Tang Family, was as beautiful as a flower and was chosen by the Tang Family. After he became pregnant, he was not tolerated by the Head's official wife and was quickly expelled.As soon as he understood, his mother died of an illness. He had been living with the old blacksmith ever since, learning the art of forging from him.\"The people here can actually cultivate?\"In's memories, the people of this world, after cultivating their techniques, were able to produce Genuine Qi s in their bodies. Only such a person would have the chance to become a revered Weapon Refiner and forge a true powerful weapon.For example, the old blacksmith was said to be a low level Weapon Refiner.The young Tang Huan was also extremely interested in forging, but unfortunately, his aptitude was ordinary. Even now, he had not been able to cultivate Genuine Qi and could only forge normal weapons.Last month, the old blacksmith suddenly left and has yet to return. The teenager was left with no choice but to take out a few weapons to sell.On the way to the market, he unintentionally met a few Tang Family s. There was a conflict between them, and in the end, he lost his life and was thrown back into the blacksmith shop.\"This kid is already dead, why is his memory still in his head?\"Tang Huan was startled, then remembered the conversation he heard when he was in a trance, a bad premonition arose in his heart, and he subconsciously looked down, his hands were rough, full of calluses, his body was long and thin, he wore coarse clothes, and on his feet was a pair of black cloth shoes that had been washed until they were white.This was definitely not his body!Tang Huan was shocked, he suddenly jumped and kept looking around.After a while, Tang Huan stood in front of a bronze mirror, looking at the handsome yet bronze-skinned stranger's face, he was dumbstruck.Now, he finally realized something.The him on Earth was already dead, but his soul had mysteriously entered the body of the Glory Continent, the young boy who had just died, Tang Huan, and received his memories.Only after a long while did Tang Huan wake up as if from a dream, and a trace of a bitter smile surfaced on his face.It seemed like he wouldn't be able to go back no matter what. In this world where he didn't have a cell phone, computer, television, or car, would he be able to live on?But since things had come to this point, there was no point in self-pity.\"Fine, since you're already here, let's settle down!\"Tang Huan took a deep breath, and finally helplessly accepted the reality. However, if he wanted to live a better life in this world, he needed to have a strong ability, otherwise, he would be like the youth who was beaten to death by the Tang Family, and probably would not have anyone come to seek justice for him.\"Cultivate!\" Only by cultivating could he have the power to protect himself, and only by cultivating could he become a noble Weapon Refiner! Otherwise, I can only allow myself to be bullied by others! \" A flash of determination flashed across Tang Huan's eyes, and he began to carefully recall the memories of that youth, Tang Huan.\"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art?\"Not long later, Tang Huan found the technique the old blacksmith taught him.This \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" was said to be a very good low level entrance technique. There were nine Spiritual Meridian s in his body. As long as he opened up one of them, he could absorb the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth and refine it, producing the Genuine Qi. The more Spiritual Meridian opened up, the more Genuine Qi he could store in his body.According to the Glory Continent, to open three Spiritual Meridian s would be to open six Spiritual Meridian s, then one would open nine Spiritual Meridian s, and one would open nine Spiritual Meridian s.Then, he would be able to condense Spiritual Wheel and advance to Stage Four Martial Master.Of course, to the current Tang Huan, that was still an extremely distant matter. His top priority right now was to try and clear the first Spiritual Meridian.In regards to this, Tang Huan wasn't very confident.The original owner of this body had been cultivating \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" since he was six years old. Even now, after a whole ten years, he still hadn't been able to open a single Spiritual Meridian.This kind of aptitude was indeed very ordinary.\"There is a spirit in this world that is derived from energy, an invisible spirit energy that is formed from the Spiritual Meridian of a god. Spiritual Meridian s, the Meridians of the Human Body. \"Tang Huan immediately sat down on the ground with his legs crossed, eliminating all distracting thoughts and calming his heart.Very quickly, Tang Huan followed the guidance of the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\", his ten fingers constantly changing positions, familiar and quick. This kind of entry-level cultivation technique, that young man had already cultivated it for ten years. Although he had not been able to learn anything, he was already very familiar with the cultivation technique's incantations and the various Hand Spell s.\"Buzz!\"In the next moment, Tang Huan felt as if an intense vibration sounded out in his mind, following that, a huge red cauldron suddenly appeared in his mind.The cauldron was circular, with two ears on top and three feet on the bottom. Fine and mysterious patterns were carved into the sides of the cauldron. Once it appeared, Tang Huan felt a kind of ancient and distant aura. It was as if it had finally awakened from its slumber after experiencing countless years.\"Isn't that my Sword Refine Furnace?\"Tang Huan was slightly taken aback.Back then when he had obtained the Ancient, he had also obtained a sword forging furnace. In the end, when the treasure sword was about to be forged, it was sucked dry of blood and died by the Sword Refine Furnace. Logically speaking, the furnace should still be in the Sword Crafting Workshop, but why did it appear in his mind now?Tang Huan was extremely confused, but immediately, the various patterns on the cauldron seemed to have come to life as it continued to spin at a very fast speed, and in his mind, it released a hundred million fiery red lights. Following that, strands of cool Qi were activated, and gathered around his body from all directions.Vaguely, Tang Huan noticed that the patterns on the surface of the cauldron seemed to be condensing into four huge runes.\"Nine Yang Divine Furnace?\"The doubt in Tang Huan's heart grew even more, and following the constant changes in his Hand Spell, the spirit power crazily flowed into his body and gathered in the cauldron.Based on that youth's ten years of experience, Tang Huan knew that those auras should be the so-called spirit energy.A moment later, the spirit energy that had gathered in the cauldron turned into a huge current, roiling and whistling out. Following the change in Tang Huan's Hand Spell, the spirit energy quickly flowed through his body.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: 2Chapter 2 - Stage One Martial Disciple\"So fast?\"Tang Huan stared at him, tongue-tied, unable to believe that this was true.The original owner of this body had cultivated \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" for more than ten years, yet he was able to open a Spiritual Meridian in such a short time?Tang Huan couldn't help but start to appreciate it again.The comfortable feeling that was like drinking nectar persisted. It was clear that the Spiritual Meridian was not an illusion. Now, he could clearly feel the direction of the Spiritual Meridian in his body, and it was not like before where he could only imagine its existence in his mind.\"It must be the effect of that 'Nine Yang Divine Furnace'.\"In the instant that the Spiritual Meridian was connected, he stopped his cultivation of the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" due to extreme shock. The cauldron in his mind still existed, but had also quieted down at the same time, and the spirit energy that was originally sucked into his body was also completely exhausted during the process.Its body was still in this form, and was only in a different soul. However, the enormous difference between its front and back made Tang Huan have no choice but to associate it with that strange \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\".He even felt that not only did his soul not dissipate after his death, it had even been reborn in the Glory Continent because of that \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\".\"Eh? \"That's not right!\"Turning his attention back to his body, Tang Huan suddenly gasped, his pretty face was full of surprise, \"The Spiritual Meridian that was just completed, how could it be so big?\"According to the old blacksmith and the information that the teenager received, when the first Spiritual Meridian was first connected, it was even smaller than a chopstick's mouth.The following Spiritual Meridian would grow larger and larger one by one, while the previous Spiritual Meridian would also gradually expand along with continuous cultivation. In the end, when every one of the nine Spiritual Meridian were completely linked, each of them could become as big as a chopstick. Of course, as his cultivation level increases, the Spiritual Meridian will also continue to grow.Not everyone, of course.There were some people with exceptional aptitude who, when the first Spiritual Meridian was connected, would be slightly larger than an ordinary person. Whether it was larger by ten to twenty percent, or larger by thirty to forty percent, Tang Huan on the other hand, had better, because the first Spiritual Meridian he connected was larger than even the tip of the chopsticks.\"Because of the stove again?\"After a long while, Tang Huan finally snapped out of his daze.To have such a large Spiritual Meridian on the first try was indeed a little unbelievable. However, having a large Spiritual Meridian, not only was it not a bad thing, it was actually an extremely good thing.The larger the Spiritual Meridian, the larger the capacity it could contain, thus the combat power would naturally be stronger.Tang Huan quickly calmed himself down and continued to cultivate the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\", his ten fingers once again changing into various types of Hand Spell. As expected, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" in his mind became bright and vibrant once again as it quickly rotated. Not long after, strands of spirit energy began to enter his body.This time, Tang Huan's senses were even clearer.The spirit energy was initially attracted by the Hand Spell before it entered Tang Huan's body, but the moment the spirit energy touched Tang Huan's body, it was immediately absorbed by the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\". Following the constant rotation of the furnace, the spirit energy was slowly refined into a warm and harmonious Genuine Qi, and circulated within the Spiritual Meridian.Unknowingly, the amount of Genuine Qi in Tang Huan's body began to accumulate more and more, and before even fifteen minutes had passed, the Spiritual Meridian had already become filled up. At this time, Tang Huan felt as if there was a warm current flowing inside his body that was quickly moving between his limbs and bones in a steady stream.\"Try the second Spiritual Meridian!\"Tang Huan's heart moved slightly as the Hand Spell formed between the ten fingers of his two hands underwent a great change.In the next moment, the first Spiritual Meridian started to boil, like a broken dam, it converged into the Nine Yang Divine Furnace and rushed out of the cauldron at an even faster speed, as if mercury was flowing out of the second Spiritual Meridian.\"Boom!\"Not long later, Tang Huan felt his body lighten, and that feeling of ease appeared again. After a short while, the second Spiritual Meridian was already complete.\"He connected to another Spiritual Meridian, that's too fast!\"Tang Huan was wild with joy.As expected, the second Spiritual Meridian was a bit wider than the first. As the Genuine Qi continued to circulate, the first Spiritual Meridian would gradually become as big as the second.\"Wait until the Genuine Qi is sufficient, then we'll see if we can obtain the third Spiritual Meridian!\"Tang Huan was completely confident.Having two Spiritual Meridian connected in a row not only allowed Tang Huan the hope of increasing his strength, but also allowed him to see the light of dawn as a Weapon Refiner.Becoming a true Weapon Refiner was not only what the young Tang Huan desired, it was also his own wish.From his point of view, the Sword Craftsman on Earth was actually equivalent to the Weapon Refiner of this Glory Continent. However, the weapons refined by the Weapon Refiner seemed to possess even more power. Back on Earth, his lifelong wish was to refine a peerless famous sword that could be passed down through the ages.But unfortunately, even if he lost his life because of this, he still wasn't able to accomplish what he wanted.But here, Tang Huan could see the possibility of fulfilling his wish, and, after becoming a Weapon Refiner, he would not only be able to forge a peerless famous sword, but also other peerless treasures. When he thought of those exceptional famous tools being created one by one, Tang Huan became extremely excited.After a while, Tang Huan continued to cultivate in high spirits.It did not take long to link the first Spiritual Meridian and the second one, but it took nearly two hours to make the width of the two.\"Break through the third Spiritual Meridian!\"It was noon, so Tang Huan took a deep breath and changed the Hand Spell once again.This time, the process was much more difficult. Even with the help of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", the speed at which the Genuine Qi was progressing through the third meridian was still very slow.Tang Huan was not discouraged, the Genuine Qi continued to be consumed, and continued to be replenished.The existence of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" caused the Genuine Qi in Tang Huan's two meridians to never truly break, and under the continuous impact of the Genuine Qi, the third meridian also became smoother bit by bit.Time passed like water.\"Boom!\"In the evening, Tang Huan's entire body suddenly shook. After an afternoon had passed, the third Spiritual Meridian had finally been unlocked.As Tang Huan breathed a sigh of relief, he also felt a deep sense of exhaustion. However, he could not hide the joy that appeared between his brows.\"Breaking through three Spiritual Meridian s, you can be considered a Stage One Martial Disciple!\"Feeling the three unobstructed Spiritual Meridian s in his body, Tang Huan couldn't help but tear up.That young man had trained diligently for ten years, even in his dreams, he wished to become a Stage One Martial Disciple. But now, in a single day, he had cleared three Spiritual Meridian s and completed this young man's wish.Although this body had changed souls, Tang Huan had merged with the youth's memories that were more than ten years old. His emotions would inevitably be affected by the memories.After a long while, Tang Huan finally calmed himself down and continued to cultivate the Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art.After all three Spiritual Meridian s were plentiful, Tang Huan became spirited again. Soon after, rumbling sounds came from his stomach. He finally realized that his body hadn't eaten since morning, and his stomach was rumbling with hunger.\"Looks like I'll have to take out a few more weapons to sell.\"Tang Huan stood up and swept his eyes over the weapons hanging on the surrounding walls.It had been a month since the old blacksmith left Furious Waves City, and he had already spent all the money he had left behind. This morning, the young man wanted to sell a few weapons to support himself, but when he met those Tang Family s on the way, he died on the spot and his corpse was thrown back into the remote blacksmith shop.After choosing three sharp long blades and wrapping them with oily rags, Tang Huan placed them on his shoulders and walked out of the shop with big strides.In the Glory Continent, only graded weapons would be able to sell for a high price, and those high grade weapons were even more difficult to find.And unranked weapons were very cheap.For example, the three long blades that Tang Huan was carrying, if he brought them to the weapon shop, he estimated that they would only sell for two or three gold coins, which was not much more than regular farm equipment.But if it was a low-grade weapon, no matter how poor the quality was, it would still be worth at least a hundred gold coins.However, he couldn't care so much now, he would just have to fill his stomach first. With two or three gold coins, he could save some time and live in Furious Waves City for a few days.\"Someone's coming?\"Before even exiting the blacksmith shop, Tang Huan was startled, and immediately revealed a smile.After clearing three Spiritual Meridian s and becoming a Stage One Martial Disciple, his hearing had improved tremendously, and he could easily hear footsteps coming from outside.Tang Huan carefully explained it to them, there should be three people.The people who were running over to the blacksmith shop must have wanted to buy weapons, which was exactly what Tang Huan wanted. Not only did they save time running errands, they should also avoid being pressured by the weapon shop. Three long blades would only be worth two or three gold coins in the weapon store. Here, the price could be higher.In the next moment, Tang Huan took out his long blade and placed it on the wooden table by the side, then stood in the middle of the bed and waited.Not long after, three figures appeared in front of the blacksmith shop. They were three youngsters, all around the age of sixteen or seventeen. Each of them had a sword hung from their waists.As their gazes intersected, Tang Huan and the three youths were all stunned.In a flash, Tang Huan regained his senses. With eyes spitting fire, he rushed towards the top of his head in anger, and almost spat out these words while gritting his teeth.This morning, the young Tang Huan was beaten to death by the three people opposite him. Now that he saw them again, the young man's memories of being angry at these Tang Family s immediately gained the upper hand, making Tang Huan want to immediately rush over and ruthlessly teach all of them a lesson.\"Brother Hong, this kid isn't dead at all.\"After being stunned for a while, the three people in front of him had also regained their senses. A teenager dressed in black laughed and swaggered over, sizing up Tang Huan in an unexpected manner.\"Indeed, when humans are cheap, they are tenacious!\" Another frail looking youngster also walked in front of Tang Huan, his face filled with contempt.\"You dog, you actually dared to play dead with your father. Do you still want to taste the feeling of being beaten!?\"The tall and sturdy teenager who was addressed as \"Brother Hong\" stopped in front of Tang Huan in two steps. He was actually taller than him by a whole head, looking down at Tang Huan from above.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: 3Chapter 3 - Meteor HammersTang Huan was extremely familiar with these three people. The tall and sturdy youth who was just inches away from him was called Tang Hong, the black-clothed youth was called Tang Jiang, and the thin and weak youth was called Tang Junjie.There were three great families in Furious Waves City, and Tang Family was one of them.Below Tang Family Tang Tianren were Tang Tianshi and Tang Tianfeng, his two younger brothers. Amongst them, Tang Hong was Tang Tianshi's youngest son while Tang Jiang was Tang Tianfeng's second son.As for Tang Junjie, he was also a Disciples.Tang Huan's identity as the illegitimate child was not a secret in the Tang Family. Since he was young, Tang Family often used to humiliate and bully him.Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie were only three out of the three.Tang Huan had swore to make everyone who bullied him pay, and because of this, even if he did not succeed in ten years, he had never given up on cultivating.\"You dog, you still dare to glare at me? Fine, let this old man help you relax your bones again!\"Seeing Tang Huan staring at him fiercely, Tang Hong felt like a shark smelling the smell of blood, he grinned, and then smashed his palm onto Tang Huan's shoulder.This morning, they met Tang Huan on the road and didn't pay attention to the severity of the attack. Beating him to death made Tang Hong and the others feel a little guilty, so they came over to take a look at the situation in the evening.Seeing that Tang Huan was looking down on him, Tang Hong immediately became fearless.The moment the palm touched Tang Huan's shoulder, Tang Hong snickered. Using his five fingers, he prepared to use the same method to lift Tang Huan up and throw him out, throwing him into the mud like a dog.But after a moment, the smile on Tang Hong's face froze, although his claws were gripping Tang Huan's shoulders, Tang Huan's body did not move at all.\"Bam!\"Immediately after, Tang Hong felt as if his abdomen was struck by a thousand kilogram boulder, and all of his intestines seemed to have been broken into countless pieces. After letting out a miserable howl, he clutched his stomach and bent down like a cooked shrimp, his ferocious face immediately wrinkling into a chrysanthemum.\"You, you dog!\"Tang Hong found it hard to believe the fist that just left his abdomen, but before he could even curse out loud, he was replaced by a sharp cry from his throat. He then floated up and spun a few rounds in the air, then was thrown away like a cloud.\"Plop!\"Tang Hong's burly body landed heavily on the road outside of the smithy, and started to chew on the mud.\"What's going on?\"\"Are my eyes playing tricks on me?\"Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie were originally waiting by the side for a good show, but they never thought that the last thing they would see was such a scene. In that moment, the two were so shocked that their eyeballs nearly popped out from their sockets, and at this time, the smile on their faces did not even disappear, their expressions extremely strange.Tang Huan stood under the roof and looked at his right hand with surprise and joy.That Tang Hong was the same age as the youth Tang Huan, but the only difference was that Tang Hong had already opened up five Spiritual Meridian s.In the past, when he had met Tang Hong, he had only been beaten up;This time, Tang Huan had actually intended to risk being beaten black and blue in order to make Tang Hong suffer.Even though he had broken through three Spiritual Meridian s today and become a Stage One Martial Disciple, there was still a gap of two Spiritual Meridian s between him and Tang Hong. However, he never thought that he would be able to make Tang Hong into such a miserable state with just a single punch.\"Pui!\" \"Bah!\"Tang Hong finally regained his senses, he spat out the sand in his mouth, and rolled over as he climbed back up. Not only was he bleeding from his nose, even two of his incisors were broken.\"You're courting death, you dog!\"Tang Hong shouted out angrily from the embarrassment. With a keng qiang sound, the sword at his waist was unsheathed.He had thought that Tang Huan would resist, but he didn't care at all. The counterattack of an ordinary person was completely unable to threaten him, who was about to be promoted to Stage Two Martial Disciple. However, the sudden turn of events had given him a hard time. He had actually been beaten up by a fellow who had bullied him for so many years.At this moment, Tang Hong felt a burning sensation on his face, and his pair of angry eyes seemed to spew fire. He almost wanted to punch the face in front of him into pieces.In just a few steps, Tang Hong was able to endure the pain in his stomach, and with a wave of the sword, he arrived in front of Tang Huan.\"Meteor hammer!\"Tang Hong roared out with red eyes, he waved his hand and the sword in his hand was like an iron hammer that was thrown straight at Tang Huan's face, it was actually as fast as a meteor, bringing about a burst of sound.Although this \"meteor hammer\" had the word \"hammer\", it was not a hammer technique. Instead, it was a sword art.Amongst the Tang Family's low level combat skills, the \"meteor hammer\" could be considered not bad. Its most prominent characteristic was the word \"heavy\" and the word \"fast\". Its sword was as heavy as a hammer, and its sword was as fast as a meteor. Tang Hong had practiced the \"Meteor Hammer\" for many years now, and had learnt the essence of this low level battle skill.In his previous life, Tang Huan had never fought with anyone, and after his rebirth in this world, he had not had the time to cultivate his battle skills. Although Tang Huan had learned a fist art, it didn't have any power to speak of, and it was basically impossible for him to fight his opponent with his fist.Seeing that Tang Hong's sword was approaching menacingly, Tang Huan was unavoidably panicking.However, he had no time to think further. He hastily retreated to the side of the wooden table while Tang Hong quickly took large strides forward. Faintly, Tang Huan could feel the cold Qi that was being emitted from the sword, all the pores on his body stood up.Tang Hong was currently flustered and exasperated, he had used his weapon, and had not shown any mercy at all.Glancing at the long blade on the table, Tang Huan became anxious and without hesitation, he grabbed it to block Tang Hong's sword.\"Hu!\"The moment he held the blade, Tang Huan felt the Genuine Qi in the three Spiritual Meridian s in his body start to circulate, quickly converging into the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", and then spitting out of the cauldron like a volcanic eruption, in an instant, it flowed through his arm into the blade's body.In a split-second, the blade slashed down on the blade.\"Clang!\"A clear sound of metal clashing rang, the sword immediately swung to the side, Tang Hong also staggered a few steps forward.\"Genuine Qi?\"After stabilizing his body, Tang Hong was incomparably shocked as he opened his mouth wide. When the blade and sword clashed, he felt a huge force slam into him, his palm was numb, the sword almost fell out of his hands.But after a short period of shock, Tang Hong's expression became even more unsightly, \"No wonder you dare to be so impudent, you actually have a Genuine Qi! It looks like you have broken through the first Spiritual Meridian today, but you are extremely wrong if you think you can challenge laozi with just this little bit of Genuine Qi. \"\"You dog, lie down!\"With a shout from his mouth, Tang Hong flicked his wrist and a faint cyan light appeared in his hand as the long sword slashed towards Tang Huan's left waist from an extremely tricky angle. This one strike brought out the full potential of the low-grade combat skill, \"Meteor Hammer\". Not only was it extremely powerful, it was also as fast as lightning.Just now, when he successfully blocked the attack, Tang Huan was also rather surprised.Before he could regain his senses, he saw Tang Hong's extremely fierce sword. Tang Huan's heart skipped a beat, the force of the sword was too fast, almost at the moment of Tang Hong's attack, the sharp sword wind had reached his waist, as though it was going to cut off his clothes.When that happened, Tang Huan had no time to think, he roared, and did not dodge Tang Hong's blade, but the blade in his hand had already been raised, and the 1.5m long blade instantly slashed towards Tang Hong's head. In that critical moment, Tang Huan instinctively chose to fight to the death.\"Bastard!\"Seeing that, Tang Hong scolded loudly.If he swung his sword over, he would definitely be able to cut a large hole in Tang Huan's waist, but Tang Huan's slash could similarly split his head into two. He was still young, and had boundless prospects, so how could he bear to die together with Tang Huan?Tang Hong did not hesitate, while dodging, he changed the direction of the sword and slashed towards the blade.\"Clang!\"The blade and sword collided once again.Tang Hong let out an \"Ah\" sound. His hands were numb and painful, and he could no longer hold on to the longsword, directly falling to the ground. Previously, Tang Huan had hurriedly attacked, but this time, Tang Huan was using his full strength, so the power behind the attack was naturally incomparable.Seeing this scene, the nearby Tang Jiang and Tang Jiang were both at a loss for words.\"You, you, your Genuine Qi!\"Tang Hong could not believe his own eyes, he stared at Tang Huan in anger and fear, the moment the blade and sword clashed, he had once again felt Tang Huan's Genuine Qi.Moreover, the feeling was much clearer than last time.What made Tang Hong even more inconceivable was that the strength of Tang Huan's Genuine Qi, seemed to have reached the limits of Stage One Martial Disciple.Tang Huan had trained for so many years, but today, he suddenly opened up one Spiritual Meridian. It was not surprising, how could he open up three, or even four, or even five, Spiritual Meridian s in a single day?In just a short day, Tang Huan's Genuine Qi had become even stronger than the him who had cultivated for many years! The first time was fine, but the second time, when he had used almost all of her Genuine Qi, not only did she not manage to deflect Tang Huan's blade, but she had even sent her own sword flying!\"What the hell is going on?\"Tang Hong opened his mouth wide, and this thought uncontrollably flashed through his mind.In contrast to his shock, Tang Huan was overjoyed. Without even pausing, he took a big step forward and ruthlessly punched Tang Hong in the chest with his fist.When Tang Hong came back to his senses, he already couldn't dodge in time.\"Bam!\"Tang Huan's fist had hit its target, and Genuine Qi spewed out once again. Tang Hong was sent flying by the punch, and then smashed into the ground a few meters away like a kite with its string cut. This time, however, he didn't immediately get up. Lying on the ground, clutching his chest, he kept moaning.\"Brother Hong!\"Seeing that, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie could not help but exclaim out loud, running to Tang Hong's side, just as they were about to help him up, they realized that something was wrong.After Tang Huan defeated Tang Hong, he actually rushed towards them.\"Let's attack together!\"Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie were shocked and angry at the same time as they pulled out their swords.In less than a day, the person who didn't even need to use her Genuine Qi to easily beat him up not only had her Genuine Qi, but had also become so powerful that even Tang Hong, who had connected with five Spiritual Meridian s, laid on the ground miserably after using her weapon. The two of them had only linked four Spiritual Meridian s, and were not even a match for one.At this moment, only with the two of them working together would they have a chance of winning. But soon, they knew that the odds of victory only existed in their imaginations.\"Plop!\"\"Plop!\"Not long after, two figures fell beside Tang Hong one after the other. \"Aiyo!\" \"Aiyo!\" They cried out continuously while their swords fell to the ground.\"You \u2026\"Tang Hong, who had finally managed to catch his breath, became even more furious when he saw the scene. When he realized that Tang Huan had arrived in front of him, he subconsciously cursed out loud.But before the words left his throat, a black shoe covered in white stepped on his face. Not only did his face feel pain from the sand stuck to the bottom of his shoes, even his head seemed to be about to explode from the heavy stomp.\"You piece of trash, you really can't spit out anything good from your dog mouth. You dare to be so arrogant!\" Tang Huan exerted some strength in his legs and finally let out a mouthful of ill temper.\"You dog, I have the ability to be arrogant, what do you have? \"Even if you win, so what? Do you still dare to kill me?\" Being humiliated and indignant to such an extent by Tang Hong, his face had swollen to the color of a pig's liver, and he was cursing hysterically.\"That's right. Even if we give him a hundred guts, he wouldn't dare to do anything to us.\"\"He doesn't have the guts to kill us!\"Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie were also glaring at Tang Huan. Their injuries were not as heavy as Tang Hong's, but they did not dare to crawl back up, lest they were ruthlessly thrown on the ground again.\"It's true that I don't dare to kill all of you right now. However, there are plenty of ways to punish you.\"Tang Huan sneered, his expression becoming rather strange. \"For example, first strip all of your clothes, and then tie you all to a female pig. What is this, a Pig Knight? Tsk tsk, the first, second and third pig knight in the history of the Glory Continent, what a resounding title. \"\"You dare?\"Tang Hong's face turned pale white, he screamed out loud, causing Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie's face to turn pale. When they thought about the scene of their naked butts riding on a female pig's body, they couldn't help but shiver. If Tang Huan really did that, they would immediately become the laughing stock of the Furious Waves City, and in the future, what face would they have to face others?\"Do you think I dare?\"Tang Huan squatted down and patted Tang Hong's face with a smile.Tang Hong could not help but raise his head and look. Although Tang Huan was smiling all over, there was no trace of a smile in his eyes.He really dared!Tang Hong could not help but shiver, the curses that rushed to his mouth could no longer be said. He forcibly swallowed them back, fear leaking out of his eyes.\"Tang Huan, we are all brothers, why must you be so ruthless?\" Tang Jiang regained his senses, swallowed his saliva and laughed dryly.\"Brother? I don't have a useless brother like you. \"Tang Huan laughed in disdain, then stood up and patted Tang Hong's face, \"Let's begin, do you want to take it off yourselves, or should I?\"\"Tang Huan, we can talk it over, you \u2026\"Tang Jiang forced a smile on his face, and gave Tang Junjie and Tang Hong a meaningful glance.However, before he could finish speaking, Tang Hong was suddenly lifted up. \"chi la\", \"chi la\", a few sounds later, Tang Hong was already smooth and clean. Feeling a cold breeze on his body, Tang Hong realized what had happened. Like a young girl who had been raped, he clutched his vitals and screamed.Tang Huan laughed, his hands continued to move without stopping, just like how they were before. Not long later, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie had become like Tang Hong.The three of them huddled together, their faces red with shame and indignation.Two pairs of eyes swept across the three of them. Tang Huan curled his lips in disdain, his long blade slapping the three of them on their white bottoms, and teased: \"Alright, you guys can scram now. With just your little peanuts, getting you guys to ride the sows is simply an insult to the sows.\"\"Tang Huan, I'm not done with you!\"Tang Hong's self-esteem was once again hurt. His face was green and red, and he could no longer care about anything else as he clenched his teeth and roared angrily.Tang Huan acted as if he hadn't heard his, and mumbled to himself, \"Not good enough, the hens should still be okay. Or else, I'll go find three hens and tie one up there.\"Hurry up!\"When Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie heard this, they were so scared that their faces turned ashen. They didn't bother covering up their vital parts as they dragged Tang Hong to their left and right, fleeing into the distance.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: 4Chapter 4 - Nine Moves of Wandering DragonHe had finally vented his anger!Tang Huan laughed heartily. Hearing his laughter, Tang Hong and the other two ran even faster, and in a short while, they disappeared around the corner.This lesson would be unforgettable for them for the rest of their lives.But after laughing, Tang Huan's face turned a little more solemn. He did not care about the three people's return to Tang Family, as what he was thinking about now was going to happen in the future.Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie had been humiliated, how could they leave it at that?A day or two at the least, four or five days at the least. Tang Huan had already expected this when he had humiliated them.Before the old blacksmith left the Furious Waves City, he left him something. According to the old blacksmith, as long as he did not meet the strongest people in the world, that thing would be able to help him get through this difficult situation. Tang Huan believed that the old blacksmith would never joke about such a thing.He had already thought of a way out. If he really couldn't stay in the Furious Waves City anymore, he would go there.Above Glory Continent were Three Empires, Tang Empire s, Mo Yun s, and Sha Long s. The Furious Waves City was located at the border of the east coast of the Great Tang Empire. Thousands of miles west of Furious Waves City was the Heavenly Forging City, which was located at the border between the three nations. The Heavenly Forging City was the largest city in the Glory Continent, and its status was extraordinary, not belonging to any of the Three Empires s.Tang Family was a huge clan in Furious Waves City, but they did not dare to act rashly there.According to's thoughts, he would rather kill Tang Hong and the other two who had bullied him for so many years.The reason he did not kill them, was because he did not want to fight to the death with Tang Family so quickly. However, one day, he would make all those who had bullied him suffer, especially that evil woman, Tang Family, who would definitely make him kneel in front of his mother's grave and kowtow and admit his mistake.Tang Huan calmed his heart down very quickly. Bringing his three long blades, he closed the shop and walked away.The Blacksmith Shop was located in the northern part of Furious Waves City. It was located in a rather remote location, a few hundred meters away from the nearest house.This would take more than half an hour.In the end, Tang Huan made his way back to the smithy in the dark.After eating his fill, he bought a bag of rice and a few dishes that could be stored for a few days, then he ran out of gold coins.At the back of the shop was a small yard with two rooms at the side, one for the old blacksmith and the other for himself.The first thing Tang Huan did after entering the room and lighting up the candles was to take out a piece of something that looked like a piece of jade from the cabinet beside the bed. It was a bright red, about three fingers wide and three inches long.On the front of the jade tablet, the lines that formed the 'sect' word of this world, and the characters around it were like yellow rose flowers.The lines on the back were a bit more complicated. It looked like a sword, a knife, and a hammer intersecting each other. Beneath the blade, sword, and hammer was a blazing flame.This jade token was something left behind by the old blacksmith.According to the old blacksmith, when he encountered danger, a miracle would happen if he pressed the word \"Zong\" forcefully.In the past, the young man did not think too much about it, but now, Tang Huan felt that the old blacksmith's identity was not as simple as he appeared to be.According to the memories of the youth, Tang Huan, the old blacksmith would leave the Furious Waves City almost every once in a while. The youth had also asked about the old blacksmith's whereabouts, but the old blacksmith had always tried to change the topic in the end.His whereabouts were mysterious, and he was only one of them.Second, was this strange jade tablet. If the old blacksmith was really just an ordinary low-level Weapon Refiner, it would be impossible for him to tell Tang Huan so confidently that this small jade tablet could help him pass through any danger.\"No matter what, I have to hurry up and train.\"Tang Huan muttered as he placed the jade medallion into his pocket. After calming his mind, he began to cultivate the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\".The victory he had obtained in the evening had greatly increased Tang Huan's confidence. What was most important now was that he had to first have the first two Spiritual Meridian s reach the third Spiritual Meridian.Afterwards, he would train his combat skills and increase his strength.When he woke up from his cultivation, there was already dawn outside his window. After a night had passed, the three Spiritual Meridian s were already as wide as before.\"When opening the second Spiritual Meridian, he used almost two hours to widen the first and second Spiritual Meridian. After opening the third Spiritual Meridian, it took him an entire night to widen the first and second Spiritual Meridian. It seems that in the future, every time he expanded the Spiritual Meridian, he would need to spend more and more time. When he reached the ninth Spiritual Meridian, it might take him dozens of days or even dozens of days to widen the first and eighth Spiritual Meridian.\" Tang Huan pondered.This was normal, as the difficulty of broadening the Spiritual Meridian was indeed increasing.From the memories of this young man, Tang Huan, some people might not even be able to fully expand their Spiritual Meridian after they had mastered the ninth Spiritual Meridian in half a year.Dozens of days were spent as little as possible.\"Now that I'm practicing that fist art, I wonder how effective it will be?\"Feeling the three Spiritual Meridian s full in his body, Tang Huan was ready to make his move. He mumbled to himself, then jumped down from the bed and ran out into the courtyard excitedly.These four words flashed across Tang Huan's mind, and related memories quickly emerged in succession.This \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" was the same as the \"Meteor Hammer\" Tang Hong had used yesterday. It was a low level battle skill that had been taught to him by the old blacksmith a few years ago. For the past few years, the youth, Tang Huan, had practiced this technique almost every day. This kind of fist technique was already deeply imprinted in the depths of his soul.Unfortunately, he was still unable to link with the Spiritual Meridian. Without the Genuine Qi, no matter how familiar he was with it, he would not be able to unleash the power of this battle skill. At most, he would only be able to strengthen his body and body.\"The first stage, Spreading Wandering Dragon!\"Tang Huan's body moved, and used the first move of the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\", as if a dragon had awoken and was stretching its body, stretching its muscles and bones.\"Huh?\"Just then, with a move of his body, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" in his mind started spinning quickly, following that, the Genuine Qi in his body started spinning, following the movements of the fist technique, it flowed along the movements of the fist technique, and when he used the \"Spreading Wandering Dragon\", his fist force immediately became vast.This feeling had never appeared before.This \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" was a majestic battle skill. Before this, although was able to use all of the punches and moves skillfully, he could not use the Spiritual Meridian fully, and only knew the form, not the spirit. However, the move just now was a combination of both form and spirit.\"With the Genuine Qi, things sure are different.\"Tang Huan regained his senses, and with great interest, immediately executed the second form, the \"Wandering Dragon in Ripple\". Then, the third form, \"Wandering Dragon in Sea\", the fourth form, \"Wandering Dragon in Water\", all the way to the ninth form, \"Wandering Dragon in Sky\". Tang Huan's body was like a swimming dragon, his movements were continuous, as though flowing water.The Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon was being fully unleashed under Tang Huan's hands.Especially when the last move of the \"Wandering Dragon in Sky\" was executed, Tang Huan was like a dragon swimming in the air. His entire person was like a soaring cloud, and he flew ten meters in the air before finally falling to the ground, at the same time punching out, landing right on the huge boulder at the side of the courtyard.\"Bam!\"The stone shook, Tang Huan clenched his fists and hissed continuously.Although he had used Genuine Qi in that strike, it still made his right fist feel pain and numbness. However, when he saw the long and narrow crack on the stone, he couldn't help but grin and immediately forgot about the pain. If another Spiritual Meridian was linked together, it would definitely be able to shatter a rock with a single punch.\"The Nine Yang Divine Furnace is truly magical!\"Withdrawing his gaze, Tang Huan held his fist and let out a light sigh, his heart was filled with emotions. If not for the guidance of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace s\" to the Genuine Qi, even if was already familiar with the nine forms of \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\", he would not have been able to completely grasp the profundity of the technique so quickly.I wonder if cultivating other battle skills would have the same effect?It was a pity that after the old blacksmith saw that the youth's aptitude was not good and passed on the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" and \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\", he did not pass on any other battle skills.Otherwise, he could continue trying it out right now.In a blink of an eye, Tang Huan focused his mind again, and continuously practiced \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" three times in a single breath. Only then did he stop, and compared to when he had first started, he was even more proficient in it.\"That's not right, it seems more suitable to use the 'Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon' with the sword.\"Tang Huan suddenly had a thought.\"Could it be that this isn't a fist art but a sword art? The old blacksmith saw that he wasn't suitable for it, so he taught the sword art as a fist art and only taught it to strengthen the body?\"In a second, Tang Huan immediately took out a sword.\"Spreading Wandering Dragon!\"The sword in Tang Huan's hand trembled, following a strange trajectory, he slowly thrust it out.The Genuine Qi flowed along her arm and entered the sword's body, immediately creating a strange feeling, like a giant dragon waking up from its slumber, stretching its body lazily, but a dragon was still a dragon, even if it was lazy, there was still killing intent hidden, and it perfectly fit the first style's concept.\"It really is a sword art!\"Tang Huan was ecstatic, he immediately used the, and activated it, \"Wandering Dragon in Ripple\", \"Wandering Dragon in Sea\", \"Wandering Dragon in Water\", \"Wandering Dragon in Sky\", \"Wandering Dragon in Sky\"!After finishing one set of sword technique, Tang Huan felt satisfied, no longer having the same feeling of wanting more.Moreover, after the fist technique was restored to the sword technique, the power that the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" could unleash had more than doubled. Tang Huan believed that with this battle skill, even if three Tang Hong and the others joined hands to attack him, he would still have a huge chance of winning.Tang Huan's interest was piqued, and he once again practiced the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\".\"Ding!\"After a while, the last move came out from Tang Huan's sword, the sword tip shot towards the huge boulder like an arrow, but in the next moment, a 'Bang!' sound came out, the sword had left a small hole on the huge boulder, and the sword blade actually split into two.\"This quality is too poor.\"Looking at the section of the broken sword, Tang Huan could not help but shake his head.Instantly, Tang Huan's mind moved: \"I am already a Stage One Martial Disciple, if I can cultivate Genuine Qi, if I can integrate it, then I would no longer be an ordinary blacksmith, but a real Weapon Refiner. When the time comes, I can forge a low-grade weapon of my own. \"When he thought of forging weapons, he felt every cell in his body stirring. When he was on Earth, he was able to become one of the most famous Sword Crafting Masters in the world at such a young age. It was not only because of his extraordinary talent, but also because of his interest and perseverance in Sword Crafting.Tang Huan's family had a history of learning, his father was the Sword Craftsman, and after graduating from high school, his parents left one after the other, he became even more obsessed with the art of forging swords. Because of this interest, he didn't even have the time and energy to talk about love, marry a wife, and have children. Even after he died at the age of thirty, he was still alone.Even after arriving in this world, Tang Huan's interest had not weakened in the slightest.However, this place was very different from his previous life. In his previous life, on Earth, ordinary people could forge swords and could also forge weapons that were extremely valuable, but in this Glory Continent, one had to at least possess a Genuine Qi of the Martial Disciple in order to become a Weapon Refiner and create weapons that were truly valuable.Moreover, if one wanted to become a Weapon Refiner, it was impossible to pass through the Spiritual Meridian, and one must fuse it as well.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: 5Chapter 5 - Forging the SwordAccording to the words of his previous life, the True Fire was a type of energy that was in the shape of a flame.To become a Weapon Refiner, one had to integrate the True Fire into the Dantian.That was the place where the nine Spiritual Meridian met.The difficulty of fusing with the True Fire was extremely high, there were countless cultivators in the Glory Continent, but even among a thousand people, there was a high chance that they would be able to successfully fuse with the True Fire and become a Weapon Refiner.From ancient times until now, there had been countless examples of people trying to fuse with the True Fire, only to end up suffering the backlash from it in the end.\"The question now is, how do I get my hands on the True Fire?\"had a headache, True Fire s were quite common in the Glory Continent, they were sold in the biggest weapon shop in the southern region of the Furious Waves City, for one True Fire was around 500 gold coins.This price was not considered expensive.However, to the current Tang Huan, this was an astronomical figure. Even if he sold all the normal weapons in the shop, he would still not be able to gather a thousand gold coins. Unfortunately, before the old blacksmith left, he displayed a talent that was too mediocre. Otherwise, the old blacksmith would have definitely prepared a True Fire for him.This time, the old blacksmith didn't know when he would return, so he still had to rely on himself.Tang Huan thought about it, and in the end, still thought about what he had done in the past.Although the treasured sword that he forged in his previous life could not be compared with the famous swords such as the Ancient Fish Intestine and Great Ravine, it was still an extremely rare weapon in this world. Otherwise, it would not have been able to sell at such a high price.There was a reason behind the fact that they could only sell farm tools, and that was because their quality was about the same as this world's farm tools. Even if they were strong, it was still very limited, and could not be compared with the sharp tools Tang Huan had forged in his previous life. If he were to choose any one of the works from his previous life, he would be able to cut them all in half.Of course, all the weapons in the store were actually the \"masterpieces\" of Tang Huan, the teenager.Even though this shop was opened by the old blacksmith, he rarely forged weapons, especially in recent years. This made the business of the blacksmith shop extremely depressed.\"Although I am currently unable to forge a low-grade weapon, but with my skills, the sword I forge is definitely incomparably sharp. I presume the price should not be too low.\"Tang Huan thought, and quickly made his decision.After casually making some food to fill his stomach, Tang Huan headed towards the shop in front.Although the young Tang Huan was not good at forging weapons, he had a strong body, had some strength, and was very patient. There were many sword billets s that he had forged in the shop.This way, Tang Huan could save quite a bit of effort.After familiarizing himself with the locations of the various tools, Tang Huan started to get busy. Not long later, tinkling sounds came from the shop.Tang Huan's upper body was naked, the hammer in his hand struck the red sword billets on Dun Zi's Dun one by one, and he quickly sweated profusely.As soon as he made his move, he noticed that it was much easier for him to forge a weapon than it was in his previous life.In his mind, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" had already started to turn, continuously pulling the Genuine Qi towards Tang Huan's right hand. If Tang Huan was on the Earth of his previous life, he would definitely not be able to handle this hammer that weighed twenty to thirty kilograms. But right now, he felt as if lifting it was as easy as lifting it.The heavy hammer was like a light branch that could be swung around by him.With the Genuine Qi, the speed at which weapons were forged would definitely be greatly increased.In addition, after personally forging the sword billets, he discovered that the most common weapon in the Glory Continent was the \"black profound iron\". In terms of quality, there were a lot more iron ore than Earth. If it was forged well, even if it was not of the superior grade, it would at least be able to cut one's hair and slice through iron like mud.This discovery made Tang Huan extremely excited.Following that, Tang Huan became even more focused, and completely forgot about the time. By the time he woke up from his hunger, the sky had already darkened, and it was already late at night.Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief, and looked towards the wooden platform. Over there, three swords were placed side by side.The first sword was a heavy sword. The sword was more than a meter long, and the blade was as thick as an adult's palm. This was the first time he had forged such a heavy sword. In his previous life on Earth, the heaviest treasure sword that he had ever forged was only eight kilograms. This was the first time that he had ever forged such a heavy sword, and it was also the first time that he had ever forged such a heavy sword.The second sword was about two fingers wide and seventy centimeters long. The third sword was a short sword that was also two fingers wide. It was only twenty centimeters long and had two grooves on both sides of the blade.The three swords lay there silently, their shiny black bodies seeming to be slowly flowing with a layer of ghostly light.Tang Huan picked up the long sword in the middle, quickly drawing a few sword flowers, which was extremely cold. After a while, the Genuine Qi entered the sword blade and slashed onto the iron ingots on the stage.\"Ding!\"After a series of clanging sounds, the iron ingot was split into two, and its cross section was very smooth.Following that, Tang Huan put down the long sword, and picked up the heavy sword and the short sword one by one. Just like how it was before long, the table was split into two halves.\"Alright!\"Tang Huan's face revealed a satisfied smile.In terms of delicacy and beauty, these three swords were far inferior to any of the treasured swords he had forged in his previous life. However, in terms of quality and sharpness, they far surpassed any of his previous works. The reason for this was, firstly, that the quality of the black profound iron's ore was even better, and secondly, that Tang Huan had the Genuine Qi.The use of the Genuine Qi allowed Tang Huan to display his own skills even more well. Compared to these three swords, the weapons that young Tang Huan had forged in the past were simply trash.However, apart from his joy, he was also somewhat surprised.In his previous life, he forged a treasure sword in either a few days or several days' time, but in Glory Continent, there were actually three swords every day.Of course, he had only made these three swords to earn money, so he had saved a lot of time.Even so, three rounds a day was beyond his imagination.\"Low level weapons are only mediocre. I think they can be sold for a good price.\"On the second day, after finishing breakfast, Tang Huan went out of the blacksmith's shop.At this time, the Furious Waves City had already become very lively. Walking on the small dirt road for a few hundred meters, after entering the city's streets, Martial Warriors could be seen everywhere with weapons on them.In Glory Continent, it could be considered a big city.This world was extremely vast. Besides the Glory Continent, there were also the three continents of Pang Shuo, large and small, as well as countless large and small islands and endless sea regions. Glory Continent and Origin Continent only looked at each other across the ocean.The Furious Waves City was built right on the shore of the Glory Continent, wanting to go out to sea and visit the Origin Continent s on the other side. This Furious Waves City was the best choice, because of its unique geographical location, the city was always filled with mixed fish and dragons, and a large number of Martial Warriors s went in and out of the city every day, going back and forth between the two continents.Tang Huan walked very quickly, and after about fifteen minutes, he arrived in front of the small weapon store that sold knives the day before yesterday.The owner of the weapon shop was a fat old man. He smiled like the Maitreya Buddha in his previous life, he was the good friend of the old blacksmith and was also very familiar with Tang Huan. It was said that he had already condensed the Spiritual Wheel's Martial Master. Of course, he had revealed this to Tang Huan himself.Whether it was true or false, no one knew, but Tang Huan had never seen him make a move before.In the past, all of the ordinary weapons that Tang Huan forged were sold to this Fat Old Man, uh, it was this youth, Tang Huan. After her soul occupied this body and received his memories, after these few days of fusion, he realized that he would unconsciously think of herself as that youth.In fact, Tang Huan realized that his personality was affected, and had undergone a huge change. In his previous life, he was actually a very taciturn person, but now he was much more lively and cheerful.Fortunately, this wasn't a bad thing, so Tang Huan just let it happen.The moment Fat Old Man opened the shop's door, shshestood at the door and yawned. The moment she saw Tang Huan, he asked with a smile: \"Little Tang, what kind of weapon are you planning to sell this time?\"Little Tang?\"Hearing this address again, Tang Huan could not help but shiver in disgust, he rolled his eyes and snorted twice, \"You haven't finished selling your weapons, and can't sell anymore?\"Tang Huan quickly walked past the Fat Old Man and into the shop. He placed the bag on his shoulder on the counter heavily, and as he opened it, he asked casually, \"Old Fatty, how much is it worth?\" As he spoke, the three swords that he had forged yesterday were revealed.In the shop, there was already a sword sheath, Tang Huan equipped each and every sword, hiding its sharpness.\"It's still the same as the day before yesterday, an ordinary weapon cost 1 gold.\"With a relaxed expression, Fat Old Man grabbed the heavy sword and casually unsheathed it.A ray of black light pierced into the eyeball, bringing with it a bone-piercing chill. Fat Old Man shuddered and felt her hairs standing on end, goosebumps rising all over her body.\"Eh, not bad. Your cooking skills have improved a bit.\"Fat Old Man's squinted her eyes as a hint of surprise flashed past her eyes, but he immediately said with a face full of smiles, \"This sword's quality is much better than the three blades. How about this, Little Tang, I will give you 6 gold coins? That's twice as much as the night before. \"\"One?\" Tang Huan opened his eyes slightly.\"No, three!\"Fat Old Man smiled as she stretched out three fat fingers.Tang Huan didn't say a word as he snatched the heavy sword and scabbard from the old fatty's hands, wrapped them in cloth and was about to leave the room.Seeing that, the Fat Old Man pulled Tang Huan back: \"Little Tang, what are you so anxious about? \"Alright, alright, I'll take a step back, each sword costs six gold coins, ah, one of your blades last night cost only one gold coin, now your sword is multiplied by several times, isn't that kind of attitude, fat grandpa?\"\"Old fatty, why don't you go and die?\"\"One sword for two hundred gold!\"Tang Huan said without any trace of politeness.Of course, he did not really want to leave, as the weapon shop in Furious Waves City was the one he was most familiar with.However, Fat Old Man was too stingy. If she really sold it to him for 6 gold coins, how many weapons would she have to forge to be able to afford a bunch of True Fire?\"Two hundred gold coins?\" You're robbing money! \" Fat Old Man screamed, the fat on her face trembling.\"Old Fatty, touch your own conscience and tell me. Is the price excessive?\"Tang Huan sneered.Although he had never forged a preliminary weapon before, he had seen plenty of beginner weapons. The three swords he had forged yesterday were all stronger than the average beginner weapon. The starting price was two hundred gold coins. Of course, he also left plenty of room for bargaining.His mental price was around 180 gold coins.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: 6Chapter 6 - Fire Shadow Tatoo\"Of course, of course it's too much.\"Fat Old Man glared fiercely at the pair of small eyes, \"200 gold coins, that's the price of a low level weapon. Little Tang, you're just an ordinary unranked weapon.\"\"Since that's the case, why are you still dragging me along?\"Tang Huan curled his lips and glanced at Fat Old Man's right claw.Fat Old Man's face reddened and she smiled, but she did not loosen her grip. After that, with a constipated expression, she gritted her teeth and said: \"Little Tang, I'll take another step. Fifty!\"\"Two hundred!\"Tang Huan's tone did not soften.He was very familiar with this Fat Old Man, and upon seeing his expression, she knew that there was hope. If this miser could not accept his price, she would have let go long ago.\"A hundred!\" It couldn't be any higher! This is the price for most low-grade weapons! \"\"Old Fatty, is an ordinary low level weapon comparable to my three swords? Two hundred! \"\"Alright, alright, one hundred and twenty!\"\"Two hundred!\" Old Fatty, do you want to find a low rank weapon and use it to slash at it? Let's see if it's powerful or if my sword is. \"\"How can I do that? If I cut your sword, I won't feel right.\" Little Tang, the fat grandpa really gave in for the last time, one hundred and fifty! \"\"One hundred and eighty!\"\"150 RMB, I can't raise the price anymore. This price is already a loss.\"\"Old Fatty, how about we forget about it? You and my master are old friends, so you can be considered to be my elder. How can I let you lose money? Let's go, let's go.\"\"Don't, don't! One hundred and eighty is one hundred and eighty!\" \"Deal!\"\"\u2026\"Not long after, Tang Huan carried a bag of gold and walked out happily.Inside the shop, the Fat Old Man who looked like he lost his parents at first, turned gloomy the moment Tang Huan left and her fat face smiled like a chrysanthemum flower. He immediately pulled out the three swords one by one and a complacent look appeared on her face.\"Boss, three ordinary swords cost five hundred and forty gold coins. This is too much of a loss.\" The shop assistant who was watching at the side, dumbstruck, finally regained his senses and couldn't help but ask. Five hundred and forty gold coins were enough to buy a very good low-level weapon.\"You don't know anything!\"Fat Old Man did not even raise her head as she snorted. After looking carefully for a while, she carefully sheathed the three swords, and waved to the shop assistant, \"Come, put them on the shelves. Each sword is priced at 300 gold coins, 400 gold coins!\"\"Four hundred?\" The shop assistant said as he ate, his eyes almost popping out of their sockets. \"Boss, can I sell this?\"\"Nonsense, why did I pick it up if I can't sell it? Hurry up.\"\"Oh.\"The shop assistant took the sword with a skeptical look, and Fat Old Man looked outside at where Tang Huan had disappeared to, muttering with suspicion, \"It's been a while since I last saw him, not only did he link three Spiritual Meridian s together, his skills have increased by countless of folds, and the normal weapons he forges are actually not one bit inferior to middle grade low grade weapons. If he were to fuse the True Fire and become the Weapon Refiner, wouldn't the weapons forged by him become even more outstanding? \"\"This brat just forged three of these sharp swords and he's already selling them. Could it be that he wants to buy True Fire?\"The Star Ocean Weapon Shop was the biggest weapon shop in the entire Furious Waves City.Compared to it, the small weapon store in Fat Old Man was not worth mentioning. Whether it was in terms of scale or the types of weapons sold, the two could not be compared.This Star Ocean Weapon Shop was established by the Star Ocean Commerce.Star Ocean Commerce's power was enormous, and the sale of weapons was just one of the many main businesses run by him. Almost all of the large and medium-sized towns in the Glory Continent had different sub-names that belonged to them.The Chamber of Commerce had a long history, and it was said that it had existed for over a thousand years. In the Glory Continent, as long as one was a shop, they would have outstanding reputation. Regardless of whether they bought or sold, almost all shops in the Star Ocean Commerce were the first choice.Just like the Star Ocean Weapon Shop in Furious Waves City, from morning to night, they were always customers.When Tang Huan brought the gold coins to the front of the store, he saw a bustling scene, with many Martial Warriors s going in and out of the shop in an endless stream.Taking a deep breath, Tang Huan followed the few figures into the shop.This weapon shop had a total of three floors. The first floor sold all sorts of low-level weapons, the second floor had mid-level weapons, and the third floor had high-level weapons.After entering the first floor, there was a circular counter extending from the left and right sides, and then from the innermost floor, it connected with the stairs leading to the second floor. As for the two upper floors, there was a large circle at the center, which made the weapon shop look like a round barrel.At the center of the ground floor, there was a crystal clear red pillar. The pillar was not big, and a person could completely wrap their arms around it. However, this pillar was tens of meters tall, and from the first floor all the way to the third floor.The surface of the column was etched with countless fine and exquisite lines. At the bottom of the column, the shape of a ball of fire could also be vaguely seen. The color was almost transparent.That column was surrounded by more than ten iron pillars connected to the iron chains. There were many people watching outside, but none of them entered the range of the iron chains.Tang Huan entered the weapon shop and the first thing he saw was this red pillar.It was said that it was called the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" and was able to detect whether a Martial Warriors had the talent to become a Weapon Refiner or not.The physique belonged to the Five Elements. If the physique of a Martial Warriors belonged to the fire, then it would be easy to become a Weapon Refiner. If it were gold, wood, water and earth attribute, it would be even more difficult to call them Weapon Refiner, especially for Martial Warriors whose physique was water attributed Five Elements. Of course, there were also powerful ones. In the history of the Glory Continent, there seemed to be an extremely powerful Weapon Refining Grand Master who could be called number one at that time.No matter what kind of Martial Warriors it was, as long as the Genuine Qi was placed at the bottom of the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\", the ball of flames would be ignited, transforming into a stronger flame. The better the talent the Martial Warriors had, the higher the position the flame could reach in the pillar, and vice versa.However, this test wasn't free. One would need to pay 200 gold coins each time.When he knew about the existence of this \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\", Tang Huan's heart had been moved, but he did not use the Genuine Qi to ignite the flames, nor did he use the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" for two hundred gold coins, so he could only give up.\"I wonder what my aptitude is?\"Tang Huan took a light breath, as his gaze moved away from the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo.\"In front of the two counters on each side, a large number of customers were gathered.Behind the counter, a few girls in uniform were busy, either picking out weapons for their customers or answering various questions.Behind the women were rows of shelves.On the shelves, there were all kinds of weapons: sabers, spears, swords, sticks, bows, axes, spears, hammers, and so on.Tang Huan casually glanced at it, and immediately felt dizzy.Each one of those weapons was sparkling with a faint, colorful glow. This kind of weapon was something that Tang Huan, a youth of this world, was used to. After all, he grew up in this old man's blacksmith shop, so even though he couldn't forge low level weapons, he had seen many of them.However, Tang Huan, who came from Earth, was a stranger. Even though he had absorbed the youth's memories, he still felt it to be very strange after seeing it with his own eyes.Weapons from his previous life could of course be made into a variety of colors, but that was not the color of the weapon itself. Although the low grade weapons in the shop were also of a variety of colors, the color had completely blended into the weapon, becoming one with the weapon.Tang Huan knew that this was because the materials used to forge weapons were different, as well as the various gems he had added into the forging process.When forging weapons, he would fuse all sorts of gems that possessed all kinds of mystical powers into them, allowing them to exhibit all kinds of inconceivable effects. Only a real Weapon Refiner would be able to do that, normal blacksmiths wouldn't be able to fuse gems with their weapons.To Tang Huan who was obsessed with sword forging, it was like a door suddenly opening in front of him, revealing him to a new world.Almost subconsciously, Tang Huan walked to the right side of the counter and looked at the first row of weapons racks.The first weapon on the shelf was a sword.The sword body was eighty centimeters long and the sword body was five centimeters wide. Not only was it beautiful, it was sharp and exposed, and the entire sword seemed to have a layer of faint white luster flowing out. However, what Tang Huan was paying attention to, was not this, but the cold Qi being emitted from the sword.Standing in front of the counter, Tang Huan felt a cold sensation, as if the place he was hung in was not a weapon but a piece of thousand year old ice.Seeing that, Tang Huan was very happy, he caressed his hands, wishing that he could bring the sword over to look at it.\"Hello, guest. May I ask if you want this sword?\"A crisp sound suddenly rang out.Tang Huan regained his senses and subconsciously looked over, only to realise that a girl dressed in white had appeared behind the counter. His figure was petite and exquisite, and he had a pretty face, but not only did her face reveal a smile, his clear eyes also revealed a dense smile.The servants of the Star Ocean Weapon Shop were all beauties like this, truly a benevolent sight to behold.Tang Huan was startled for a moment, he then understood that the young lady was calling him, and promptly shook his head, and said: \"I am here to buy True Fire, may I ask where I am going?\"\"Buying 'True Fire', please go there!\" Hearing that, the girl looked at Tang Huan in surprise and pointed her delicate finger at him.\"Thank you very much.\"If he had any extra gold coins, he wouldn't mind buying a few low-grade weapons to study for a while. But now, it was better to just forget about it.The girl was pointing at the intersection of the two curving lines of counters.Compared to the noisy surroundings, this place was rather cold and cheerless. Behind the counter, there was also an extremely beautiful girl in a white dress. Compared to the beautiful girl from before, this girl seemed to be much more mature.Behind the girl, there was also a wooden frame. However, what was placed on it were not weapons of various styles, but rows upon rows of fiery red colored bottles.\"This esteemed guest, would you like to purchase the 'True Fire'?\"Seeing Tang Huan walk over, the girl in the white dress bowed slightly and asked enthusiastically. Her face also revealed a charming smile, and she did not ignore Tang Huan's shabby clothes. In his previous life, he had always stressed the importance of smiling in the service of others. However, those professional smiles were not as sincere as these girls in front of him.Tang Huan looked at the bottles, his eyes lighting up: \"How many gold coins is a mass of True Fire?\"\"A thousand gold coins.\" The young girl in the white dress smiled sweetly.\"A thousand?\" How can it be so expensive? \"Tang Huan was instantly dumbstruck, and cried out in disbelief.He had always thought that the \"True Fire\" would be around 500 gold coins, even if the price was floating, it would only be around 20-30 gold coins. He thought that selling the sword for 540 gold coins was enough, but who knew that the \"True Fire\" of the Star Ocean Weapon Shop would actually raise the price, and even doubled it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: 7Chapter 7 - Qualification Testing\"This esteemed customer does not know, that Origin Continent's' Sword Crafting Valley 'has become extremely unstable recently, and the difficulty of obtaining the' True Fire 'far surpasses that of the past. Thus, the price of' True Fire 'has increased by a lot as well.\" Seeing this, the young girl in the white dress explained with a smile.\"Sword Crafting Valley?\"Tang Huan was startled, and immediately frowned.He was naturally clear about the Sword Crafting Valley s of the Origin Continent s. That place was once the artifact forging holy land at the peak of the Human Clan's era, the place that countless Weapon Refiner s yearned for.However, there were not only Human Clan s in this world. Other than Human Clan, there were also Demon Clan and Tian Clan.Among them, the Tranquil Continent that lived in the eastern part of the Origin Continent, and the Holy Spirit Continent that lived in the northern part of the Origin Continent.The Origin Continent was located in the middle of the three continents, which were Glory, Holy Spirit and Decimation. A hundred years ago, the Human Clan, the leader of the Human Clan, united the Origin Continent and expelled them. But with the death of Shan He, he fell into a state of internal strife.The Tranquil Continent took the opportunity to invade the Origin Continent, and the entire place was slaughtered.That place had already been occupied by countless specters, so entering the human Martial Warriors was extremely dangerous. However, the only place that had True Fire s were the ones that had them. Furthermore, not everyone could obtain something as mysterious as the True Fire, which resulted in the price of the True Fire being constantly high.When the Sword Crafting Valley was flourishing, a ball of True Fire only cost fifty gold coins.After the changes in Sword Crafting Valley, the price of the True Fire rose to a few thousand gold coins. Then, it slowly fell back to around five hundred gold coins.Now that the Sword Crafting Valley was not at peace, it rose back to 1000 gold coins.With regards to the white dressed lady's words, Tang Huan did not doubt that the Star Ocean Weapon Shop had an outstanding reputation. He would definitely not lie to others in this area, and even more so, would not casually raise the price.Why don't we go back and forge three more weapons to sell?Tang Huan was gloomy, it seemed that this was the only method, if he was lacking 10 or 20 gold coins, he might be able to buy them, but if he was lacking 500 gold coins, there was no need to bargain, he had to gather enough to try again.But who knows, would the True Fire continue increasing its price tomorrow?\"Customer, if you are using the 'True Fire' you bought, perhaps you can try our store's' Fire Shadow Tatoo ', as long as the flames ignite to a distance of two meters, you will be able to return half of the gold coins, and if it reaches a height of three meters, it will be able to return all the gold coins, and if it reaches a height of four meters, not only will it be able to return two hundred gold coins, it will also receive a' True Fire '.\"Seeing how Tang Huan was frowning, the lady in white suddenly asked and smiled.\"Fire Shadow Tatoo?\"Tang Huan was startled, but his eyes subconsciously looked towards the red pillar erected at the center of the shop. He did not know the Five Elements attribute of his physique, nor did he know that his aptitude was specific.Judging from the young lady's words, a two meter flame should be considered as a talent to become a Weapon Refiner. A three meter flame should be considered as a good talent, but a four meter flame should be pretty good.Tang Huan's heart skipped a beat.As long as the fire energy reached three meters, it would not be a loss. If it reached four meters, not only would it not lose a single gold coin, it would also be able to acquire the \"True Fire\", which was worth a thousand gold coins.\"F * ck, I'm betting on this!\" After a while, Tang Huan finally made up his mind. He took out two hundred gold from his bag and placed it on the counter.\"Esteemed guest, please follow me.\"The girl in the white dress kept the gold coins, held the key smilingly and walked out from behind the counter, bringing Tang Huan to the side of the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\".Seeing the girl's actions, not only were the eyes of the surrounding Martial Warriors who were looking at the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" lit up, even more people who were by the side turned to look at her.\"Oh my, is this because someone wants to test whether or not one has the qualifications to become a Weapon Refiner?\"\"The boy?\" He looked to be only sixteen or seventeen years old. How many Spiritual Meridian had he managed to open? Last time I saw a person testing the fire in this shop, the fire he ignited wasn't even 2 metres long, so it was a waste of 200 gold coins. \"\"Hehe, Weapon Refiner is that easy to appear. Even out of a thousand Martial Warriors s, there might not even be one person who has the qualifications to become a Weapon Refiner.\"\"Not bad, not bad. Even if you have this kind of talent, you may not be able to successfully fuse with the 'True Fire'.\"\"What a pity, with so much gold to waste, I might as well pick a low-grade weapon. Although I won't be able to buy anything good with 200 gold, it's still passable.\"\"\u2026\"The crowd was brimming with interest as soft murmurs echoed from time to time.\"Guest, please!\" The lady in white tilted her body slightly, and made a gesture of invitation towards Tang Huan. She then pointed at the two dents at the bottom of the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\", which were like palm prints, and said with a smile, \"Customer, you only need to place your palms there and send it into the Genuine Qi. Then, you will be able to use your cultivation technique non-stop.\"\"Alright!\"Tang Huan nodded his head and excitedly went between the two iron pillars, quickly entering the ring of chains. In the direction that the girl in the white dress pointed, there happened to be a praying mat. Tang Huan crossed his legs and directly sat down.Taking a deep breath, Tang Huan calmed himself down and slowly closed his eyes.\"Begin!\"In just a split-second, the Genuine Qi revealed its palms.The surrounding people stared at the transparent flame at the bottom of the pillar with burning eyes. Once the Genuine Qi was merged into the flame, they would be able to determine the Martial Warriors's Five Elements physique.\"Look, it's lit up!\" \"It's lit up!\"After a short moment, the surrounding crowd first let out a few low cries, but soon after, there was a disappointed sigh. Within the pillar, the transparent flame had actually turned into a dazzling white.\"The white color is the Five Elements that belongs to metal and it doesn't even have a fire attribute physique. How can it become a Weapon Refiner?\"\"See, I did not guess wrong, this kid's two hundred gold coins were wasted.\"\"That's right, aside from the fire attribute physique, there are four other physiques in the Five Elements. If one wants to become a Weapon Refiner, the chances are too slim.\"\"\u2026\"Many of the Martial Warriors s that were attracted by this commotion subconsciously shook their heads. Since ancient times, there were roughly 9,999 Weapon Refiner s amongst the ten thousand Weapon Refiner s, and all of them possessed physiques belonging to the fire attribute. There was only one, which was possibly of the other four attributes.The young girl in white, who had brought Tang Huan over, also let out an imperceptible sigh when he saw this.Looks like this guest will not be able to take back this 200 gold coins. However, this 200 gold coins, is equivalent to saving his life. His Five Elements is a type of gold body, if he were to fuse with the True Fire, he would definitely fail.Within the Five Elements, fire countered metal. The metal attribute Martial Warriors fused with the True Fire, and the damage received by the Spiritual Meridian far surpassed that of Martial Warriors of other attributes.Hearing the surrounding voices, Tang Huan's body trembled, his heart went cold, but he resisted the urge to take his hand back, and immediately activated Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art.Inside the Dantian, the cauldron was quickly revolving.In that moment, Tang Huan felt an exceptionally dense and warm Qi being stimulated, passing through the pillar and entering into his two palms, in a moment, it followed the Spiritual Meridian and rushed into the cauldron. In a blink of an eye, the warm Qi fused with the Genuine Qi, and then followed along the Spiritual Meridian to fly towards both of his arms.\"Buzz!\"The \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" suddenly began to tremble, and let out a low and deep cry.At the same time, within the pillar, the ball of flames also gradually turned from white to red, releasing increasingly resplendent fiery red luster.\"Huh?\"Instantly, surprised murmurs rose and fell.The numerous Martial Warriors s at the counter were all alarmed by this sudden commotion as their gazes quickly swept towards the center area one by one.\"Is he using the Fire Totem to test the talent of the Weapon Refiner?\"\"The flames were originally white. Could it be that the Five Elements belongs to the physique of metal?\"\"Tsk tsk, the flames have actually turned red. It looks like he has the potential to become a Weapon Refiner.\"\"What's the use of it? For a metal attribute physique to be able to produce flames of half a meter is already pretty good. To become a Weapon Refiner, it would require at least two meters of fire. \"\"That young man looks so familiar, I really want to see him somewhere.\"\"\u2026\"The crowd discussed animatedly. Although they were surprised, they did not take it to heart.In Star Ocean Weapon Shop, every few days, there would be a young man who would spend two hundred gold coins to test if she had the talent to become a Weapon Refiner. A portion of Martial Warriors who frequent this place often saw this scene, but it was a pity that very few of them could reach two meters in size.Even Martial Warriors with Five Elements belonging to the fire attribute didn't have the qualifications to become a Weapon Refiner, let alone the fellow beside the \"Flame Totem\".They all knew that their bodies were about to collapse from exhaustion, but if they were to continue on like this, it would just be a joke.Many Martial Warriors s looked at Tang Huan who was sitting in front of the pillar like a motionless sculpture, and their faces even revealed a teasing and mocking smile. But not long after, the smiles on their faces gradually disappeared, and their eyes were replaced with thick surprise.Inside the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\", after the flame had turned completely red, it began to quickly rise.In just a few short breaths, the dark red flame had already passed through the first circular pattern on the red pillar.These circular patterns were actually the same as the number on the pillar. The first circle meant a meter tall. The second circle meant two meters, and so on.\"You're already one meter away from me?\"Everyone looked at each other with unconcealable surprise.However, before they even had the chance to react, an even more shocking scene appeared. The flames continued to rise, without any signs of stopping.Not long after, the second rune was clearly visible under the red glow.\"Two meters?\"\"Doesn't this mean he already has the qualifications to become a Weapon Refiner?\"\"Hiss, a Weapon Refiner with metal Five Elements \u2026\"\"\u2026\"Everyone found it hard to believe their eyes. Even the second and third floor were startled. They all leaned on the railings and looked down in surprise.\"It's only two meters, but it has just reached the minimum requirement to become a Weapon Refiner. There is nothing strange about it.\" A Martial Warriors who was certain that the flames Tang Huan emitted wouldn't exceed half a meter, came to her senses and felt a stinging sensation on her face, after which she couldn't help but curl her lips and laugh out loud.However, before the laughter disappeared, Martial Warriors had her mouth wide open, her eyes glazed over and her face was burning with anger. In the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\", flames were rising at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye, and they were rising even faster, reaching a distance of three meters and four meters.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: 8Chapter 8 - Amazing\"It's already 4 meters 4 meters long.\"In the weapon store, almost everyone's face turned pale.Even if it was a Martial Warriors whose Five Elements was fire, to be able to ignite a flame four meters tall within that \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" could be considered a genius, let alone a Martial Warriors whose Five Elements was gold.Speaking of the difficulty of becoming a Weapon Refiner, in terms of Five Elements's physique, even if a metal attribute Martial Warriors was not number one, they were second only to the water attribute Martial Warriors.Similarly, within this \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\", the aptitude that metal attribute Martial Warriors s commonly displayed was also the last one or two.There were frequently news that a genius artificer who could ignite four to five meters of flames had appeared in the weapon shop of a certain city. However, those people were all from Martial Warriors whose Five Elements were related to fire.Five Elements belonging to the metal attribute and Five Elements belonging to the water attribute, none of them existed.On the other hand, there seemed to be a few who belonged to the Wood or the Earth of Five Elements, but their flames were only two to three meters long, and were completely unlike what they had seen at this moment.In addition, the flames in the column in front of him continued to rise higher and higher.Four meters was definitely not his limit!\"Look, look, it's already five meters long.\"Above and below Star Ocean Weapon Shop, everyone was staring at the red pillar which was getting more and more resplendent.Not too far away from the pillar, the young girl in the white dress had long since widened her round eyes. An unconcealable shock could be seen on her pretty face.Below the pillar, Tang Huan's body did not move at all.At this time, he had already completely calmed down and focused, using all of his strength, continuously absorbing the warm Qi from the pillar and sending out the Genuine Qi.Tang Huan had already turned a deaf ear to the surrounding activity.\"Buzz!\"The red pillar continued to tremble as the flames continued to rise. \"Six meters, seven meters, eight meters \u2026\"At the start, the shop could still hear cries of surprise from time to time, but as the flames continued to rise, the shop became quieter and quieter.When the flames reached eight meters, the entire space was so quiet that one could hear the sound of a pin dropping. One could only hear the incessant trembling of the pillar.Everyone was dumbstruck, their faces and brows filled with shock and disbelief that could not be hidden. A metal attribute Martial Warriors had actually been able to produce a flame that was eight meters tall within the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\". From ancient times until now, even Martial Warriors s with the fire attribute had rarely seen anything that was difficult to reach. In the end, none of them were not Weapon Refining Grand Master s.Where did this guy come from? His talent was actually so outstanding!Everyone was astonished. What was even more inconceivable to them was that after reaching a height of eight meters, the flames were still rapidly rising.Nine meters, ten meters, eleven metersTwelve meters!The red pillar was twelve meters tall, and the flames were also twelve meters tall. The flames that the person let out had actually reached the peak, passing through the entire \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\".Everyone was completely numb. Their eyes were wide open and their mouths gaping open. They were motionless like clay puppets.Whether it was the first floor of the weapon shop or the second or third floor, the fiery red light emitted by the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" practically caused everyone's soul to enter the sucking.There was actually someone in this world that could use the totem flame to such an extent?Could this guy still be considered human?To be able to ignite a flame four meters long could be considered a genius artificer, but the flames he produced had actually reached the limit of a \"Fire Shadow Tatoo.\" If that \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" was even taller, wouldn't the flames that he controlled be able to continue increasing?Twelve meters was an unattainable and terrifying number. It was enough to make countless Martial Warriors who wished to become a Weapon Refiner look up to it.\"Hmm, it's gone?\"Just then, Tang Huan who was in front of the pillar seemed to have woken up from a dream, he muttered and subconsciously withdrew his palms. Just a moment ago, the warm Qi in the pillar suddenly disappeared.Seemingly at the same time that Tang Huan retracted his palm, the bundle of flames within the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" began to rapidly descend.Tang Huan who had just opened her eyes, felt a red light flash before her eyes, and the flames in the pillar of the pillar became a ball at the bottom, and the red color in the flames also quickly faded, and in an instant, the ball of flames became transparent once again, and the pillar that had been trembling for a long time also calmed down.\"How many meters was my flame?\"Tang Huan could not help but look at the girl in the white dress and ask her nervously. He should have first opened his eyes and then retracted his hands, because that way he would have known how strong the totem flames were.The moment the words left his mouth, Tang Huan noticed that the atmosphere here was extremely strange.This enormous Star Ocean Weapon Shop was actually deathly still. Nearly everyone around had the same expression, and their mouths agape, as if they had seen something extremely shocking. This scene looked as though the entire space had frozen in place.This situation made Tang Huan feel even more apprehensive.\"Twelve meters!\"Hearing Tang Huan's words, the girl in the white dress finally regained her senses, her black eyes rolled back as she swallowed saliva with difficulty, and spat out these words.\"Twelve meters?\"Tang Huan jumped up from the praying mat like a spring. After discovering that he had a physique that belonged to the Golden Five Elements, he did not hold much hope for the Dragon Shadow Tatoo, and the reason he kept trying was because he was not willing to give up. After all, this \"Dragon Shadow Tatoo\" cost two hundred gold coins.But Tang Huan had never thought that the flames he could ignite would actually reach a distance of twelve meters!Reach four meters, and you will get a point of \"True Fire\", reaching twelve meters. This far exceeded the standard set by the Star Ocean Weapon Shop.After the short period of shock, the unease in Tang Huan's heart disappeared, and his eyes were filled with undisguised happiness. He couldn't help but rub his hands, and laughed: \"Miss, about that, can you give me two hundred gold coins and a set of 'True Fire'?\"\"Ah?\" \"Oh.\"As if she had awoken from a dream, the girl in the white dress hurriedly ran back to the counter. After a while, she ran back with a True Fire bottle and a bag of gold coins in her hands.\"Many thanks. Then, I'll take my leave first.\"Tang Huan accepted it, without bothering to count the gold coins, he quickly left the weapon shop.He'd already realized that he'd gone a bit too far just now, as the surrounding gazes caused him to feel a bit scared. It was better for him to leave as soon as possible.\"Boom!\"The moment Tang Huan's figure disappeared, countless of gasps could be heard from the weapon store. The loud sound seemed to want to flip the entire building over.\"I didn't expect this! I really didn't expect that young man to be able to ignite the fire totem to a size of 12 meters!\" That's twelve meters, not two meters! \"\"This trip to the weapon store was right, I have really broadened my horizon today.\"\"Rumor has it that in the Heavenly Forging City a few years ago, there was a person who managed to ignite a twelve meter long totem flame?\"\"Are you for real?\"\"Of course it's true, but that person seems to be a woman and furthermore, he has a physique that belongs to fire.\"\"Who knows where this person came from?\" If he is able to successfully fuse with the True Fire, then our Glory Continent will probably have another Weapon Refining Grand Master that can shake the heavens and the earth in just a few years! \"\"\u2026\"Everyone shouted over and over, wantonly venting the shock and horror that had been stored in their chests for a long time.\"Haha, so what if it's twelve meters? I still have to be able to successfully fuse with the 'True Fire'. Don't forget, he has a metal attribute constitution, and the difficulty of fusing with the 'True Fire' far surpasses that of an ordinary Martial Warriors. \"If I can't absorb the 'True Fire', then no matter how strong my innate talent is, it won't be of any use. Maybe \u2026\"A slightly hoarse voice suddenly sounded out, sounding exceptionally ear-piercing amidst the exclamations.The one who spoke was the Martial Warriors who had previously asserted that the flames were not more than half a meter, and pursed his lips in disapproval, but before he could finish, he noticed many angry gazes sweeping over, obviously dissatisfied with his mocking and ridicule.\"This possibility exists!\" The Martial Warriors felt weak at the bottom of her heart. After forcing out a smile, he quickly shut her mouth and left the shop dejectedly. Seeing that, a few of the surrounding Martial Warriors who were clenching their fists walked over to him. Only then did they snort in disdain and join the lively discussion.\"Ah, I remember now.\"\"That guy, he seems to be called Tang Huan, and lives in the north side of the city. His master seems to be a low level Weapon Refiner, I tried to find his master to help me forge a low level weapon last year, but when his master wasn't around, it was him who treated me. At that time, he didn't even seem to be able to forge a Spiritual Meridian.\"\"Last year was an ordinary person? Impossible, right? \"\"\u2026\"Returning back to the courtyard behind the smithy, before Tang Huan could even sit down, he impatiently took out the True Fire bottle from his bag.Looking at the floating ball of flame in the bottle, he couldn't help but feel a little excited.Although he did not spend the five hundred gold that he had earned from selling the swords, and the way he obtained the \"True Fire\" was somewhat unexpected, he still managed to get his hands on this thing.But after the excitement, Tang Huan frowned and fell into deep thought.If not for that \"Fire Shadow Tatoo,\" he still would not know that his own physique was actually profound energy which was considered gold.Compared to the Martial Warriors s whose Five Elements were fire, the difficulty of successfully fusing the True Fire with this kind of physique would be multiplied by several times.\"This is going to be troublesome.\"Tang Huan sighed, \"It's fine if it isn't the fire element, but even the wood element and the earth element. But I never thought it would be the metal element.In terms of success rate in fusing with the \"True Fire\", the water attribute Martial Warriors was the lowest.Water could counter fire. In the process of fusion, the \"True Fire\" was constantly being weakened. Where was the \"True Fire\" that was being weakened? However, in terms of danger, it was the metal element that had the largest effect. When fusing with the \"True Fire\", the \"True Fire\" could even melt the Martial Warriors's Spiritual Meridian.A hundred metal attribute Martial Warriors s would not necessarily have one who had successfully fused with the \"True Fire\".\"Since we have already obtained the 'True Fire', how can we just give up like that?\"Tang Huan's face was unsettled, after a long while, he gritted his teeth and sat down.He understood in his heart that this body originally did not have the aptitude to become a Weapon Refiner. The main reason why this body could produce such a frightening twelve meter tall flame within the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" was because of the existence of this \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\". Perhaps this cauldron could also reduce the difficulty of fusing with the \"True Fire\".Whether I succeed or lose, it all depends on this one move. If I succeed, I will live; if I fail, I will perish!Tang Huan squinted his eyes, his mind was calm like never before. If he wanted to achieve his two lives' wish, then this step would not shrink back.\"Bo!\"In the next moment, Tang Huan uncorked the bottle and covered the mouth of it with his right palm at lightning speed.A blazing heat suddenly rushed up, and Tang Huan felt as if his palm was pressing on a red-hot iron. Immediately, an indescribable pain came from his palm.Tang Huan grimaced, his face becoming somewhat sinister and distorted. An instant later, he faintly smelt a burnt stench from his palm.\"Endure it!\" \"Endure it!\"On Tang Huan's forehead, beads of perspiration trickled down. However, he forced himself to remove his palm from the mouth of the bottle, and tried his best to circulate the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\". He was very clear that if he really let go of his hand, the ball of \"True Fire\" inside would definitely rush out of the bottle and escape.Very quickly, a trace of scorching Qi entered the Spiritual Meridian through his palm.\"Hiss!\"Tang Huan instantly felt as if a ball of fire was burning within her Spiritual Meridian. The burning sensation became more intense, and he couldn't help but take in a breath of cold air. His entire right arm spasmed violently, and the Spiritual Meridian that was being flooded by the heat seemed as if it was about to melt.Damn, no wonder there were so few Weapon Refiner s, this kind of pain really wasn't something anyone could endure.Moreover, his Five Elements was a type of gold, so the pain he had to endure in the process of becoming a Weapon Refiner was far more than what he could endure.Tang Huan pursed his lips, showing no signs of giving up.If he didn't succeed, then he would die!As the youngest progressive master on Earth, if he couldn't forge a powerful weapon in this world after coming to Glory Continent, what kind of fun would there be?\"Buzz!\"But just as Tang Huan was preparing to use the Genuine Qi to guide the strand of blazing Qi, a familiar trembling sound suddenly resonated in his mind.Immediately afterwards, that strand of heat flowed like iron filings attracted by the magnet, quickly spreading upwards along the Spiritual Meridian.His speed increased, but the flow of heat did not decrease at all. Everywhere he went, his muscles trembled.Tang Huan clenched his teeth tightly, he did not make a sound, but his eyes continued to widen and his entire body continued to spasm. More and more perspiration poured out from his pores, in the blink of an eye, he was drenched as if he was a chicken that had just been fished out of water.In the blink of an eye, several hours had passed \u2026The scorching heat finally reached the Dantian, but it did not slow down at all. It still rose continuously from the bottle into his palm and followed the Spiritual Meridian to his lower abdomen.Tang Huan did not let up at all. Both of his eyes bulged and he clenched his teeth as he endured. His handsome face had already swelled up to a purple red, and his tensed body was shaking like a sieve. Under the continuous burning of the strong heat, Tang Huan felt like his entire body was going to explode.An extremely strong heat was emitted from Tang Huan's body.His skin was becoming redder and redder. When he breathed, what came out of his nostrils seemed to be not air, but two flames. Even the thirty-six thousand pores on his body seemed to emit hot steam at all times.Tang Huan felt as if his entire body was about to melt into juice.Although the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" could greatly speed up the absorption of the \"True Fire\", it could not lessen the pain that Tang Huan had to endure while absorbing the \"True Fire\". Not only did the pain spread to his limbs and bones, his internal organs, and even deep into his soul.Tang Huan felt as if his soul was enveloped by blazing flames. Under the assault of the heat, his soul trembled and even his consciousness became blurry.But just when Tang Huan felt that he was about to collapse, he suddenly felt relaxed, and the last bit of heat flowed into the Dantian and into the cauldron.Then, Tang Huan collapsed onto the ground on his back, like a thirsty fish jumping to the shore. He opened his mouth and gasped for air, not even able to move a finger.\"Did this kid succeed?\"On top of a big tree outside the academy wall, a fat old man gasped in a low voice. His tiny eyes revealed shock and joy that was hard to conceal, \"Not only did he succeed, but his speed is beyond imagination. It would take at least four hours for an ordinary person to fuse with a set of 'True Fire', but this kid doesn't seem to have been there for half an hour.\"\"How long did Old Man Ou take to fuse the 'True Fire' back then? Two hours? Tsk tsk, this kid is way faster than his master. \"Fat Old Man pinched her fleshy chin and laughed. She actually glided down the tree like a snake, her light and agile movements extremely inappropriate for her fat body.In the courtyard, Tang Huan laid still for a long time, before slowly recovering and turning back to sit.\"I did it!\"Looking at the empty True Fire bottle in front of him, Tang Huan laughed foolishly. Although the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was unable to alleviate his pain, it had greatly shortened the process of fusing with the \"True Fire\".\"I wonder what's going on with the 'True Fire' in my body right now?\"After a while, Tang Huan took a deep breath and cleared away all the distracting thoughts, focusing on his lower abdomen.At the location of the Dantian, there seemed to be a ball of flame that was burning. Although it was still extremely hot, what was miraculous was that Tang Huan's abdomen felt warm, and it did not feel any pain like before.Almost at the same time, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" appeared in his mind. Soon after, he discovered that there was a ball of dark red flame inside the cauldron, but in the heart of the flame, the inner part of the cluster of flame that seemed to be condensed from essence, was showing a dazzling white color.\"So that's how it is.\"Tang Huan was startled, and then he woke up.The moment the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" appeared, Tang Huan knew that although it could appear in his mind, it could not actually exist in his mind. However, for a moment, Tang Huan couldn't figure out where it was. But now, he understood that the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was in the Dantian.The Flame Heart was white, most likely because it had a metal attribute.After a while, Tang Huan calmed his mind and started to try activating the Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art.\"Buzz!\"The cauldron trembled, the heat from it blended into the Genuine Qi, and quickly travelled through the Spiritual Meridian. Wherever the heat flowed, Tang Huan felt as though all his pores were expanded, it was extremely comfortable.Genuine Qi swam a few rounds in the three Spiritual Meridian s and all the fatigue was swept away. Tang Huan's heart suddenly skipped a beat as she activated Genuine Qi and rushed towards the fourth Spiritual Meridian.\"It's cleared?\"After a while, Tang Huan was dumbfounded. The four Spiritual Meridian s had all fallen down, and were broken through so easily.He had been on a whim, but who would have thought that after fusing with the \"True Fire\", the Genuine Qi would actually increase by so much?Tang Huan was pleasantly surprised, just as he was about to continue channeling his spirit arts to broaden the first three Spiritual Meridian s, a loud 'bang' suddenly woke him up.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: 9Chapter 9 - Tiger Jumping FistTang Huan was shocked, he rushed to the front of the smithy, only to find the door of the shop had shattered and fallen to the ground. A seventeen to eighteen year old black-robed youth walked in, a sword hung by his waist, his body tall and straight.Beside him were three other youths, who were impressively, Tang Hong, and Tang Junjie, aggressively.\"Tang Chao?\"Tang Huan frowned at first, but there was an extra look of seriousness in his eyes.This Tang Chao was Tang Hong's second brother, and was only one year older than him, but his talent was much greater. It was said that he had already opened up the sixth meridian a a while ago and was promoted to Stage Two Martial Disciple. Furthermore, Tang Chao had always been hardworking in cultivation, so his strength could not be compared with a playboy like Tang Hong.But even so, Tang Huan was not afraid in the slightest.In a blink of an eye, Tang Huan shot a glance at Tang Hong and the other two as a mocking smile surfaced on his face. Tang Hong, how did it feel last time?With that, Tang Huan stepped forward quickly, ready to make his move.The expressions of Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie changed as they subconsciously retreated.\"Humph!\"Seeing that, the black-robed youth called Tang Chao could not help but snort with a gloomy face.Tang Hong and the other two came to their senses, immediately stopping in their tracks. Their faces immediately flushed red and felt like they were on fire. Tang Hong became angry from the embarrassment: \"Tang Huan, don't be arrogant, last time, this daddy was just careless. This time, this daddy will let you know the consequences of angering me!\"With a clang, Tang Hong took out his sword and pounced towards Tang Huan.\"Bring it on!\"Tang Huan laughed and took out a sword from the weapon rack.The moment the sword appeared in his hands, Tang Huan's entire aura changed greatly, like a dragon that was hiding in the abyss, as if it could cause monstrous waves at any time.Tang Hong's hair was standing on end and his expression was unsettled.Even though he didn't want to admit it, the tragedy that day had already left a shadow on him. Facing Tang Huan, the bottom of his heart couldn't help but feel fear.\"Little Hong, step down!\" Just then, Tang Chao suddenly took a step forward and bellowed.\"Yes, second brother.\"Tang Hong glared at Tang Huan fiercely, he looked extremely unwilling, but the sword in his hand was quickly sheathed back into the sheath, as though he had been relieved of a heavy burden.\"Tang Huan, although this little brother of mine is not that good, it's not up to a bastard like you to teach him a lesson!\"Tang Chao stared at Tang Huan and bellowed coldly. He looked proud and his eyes revealed a sense of ridicule and contempt.Even though he wasn't considered a genius among the young generation of the Tang Family, he still far surpassed an ordinary clan Disciples. Although he had seen Tang Huan many times in the Furious Waves City, he could not be bothered to bully a person who could not even cultivate the Genuine Qi.But this time, he couldn't not stand up for Tang Hong. No matter how muddled he was, Tang Hong was still his little brother.\"I am a bastard child, so what does Tang Tianren, who is a bastard child to me, count as?\"His right hand, which was holding onto the sword hilt, trembled slightly. Deep in his memories, the young man detested the word \"bastard\" the most, and when he heard the word, it was from his intense anger that caused Tang Huan's face to darken.\"You bastard, how dare you be so outrageous.\"Tang Chao's eyes grew cold, and his tone became even more cruel and cold, \"Originally, I had only interrupted your hand and leg, treating it as a small punishment. But now, it seems that I have only broken one of your hands and that's really too easy of you. Forget it, today I will teach you a good lesson on behalf of uncle. I will break both your arms and legs, so that you will have a good memory and know what to say, and what not to say! \"\"Boasting shamelessly!\"Tang Huan laughed out of anger, in the midst of his clear trembling cry, the sword in his hand became like a dragon, and he slowly thrusted out. His speed was not fast, but there was a hint of killing intent contained within it.Tang Chao curled his lips, his right leg fiercely stomped on the ground, and his body leaped up.At this moment, Tang Chao was like a tiger that had just broken out of its cage. Not only was his speed fast, his aura was overbearing, and the moment his body reached the highest point, his aura seemed to have reached its peak. He then punched out with his fist, smashing down towards Tang Huan's head from above.\"Hu!\" Wherever the fist passed by, a slight whistling sound was heard.\"Tiger Jumping Fist!\"Now that he had made a move, it was indeed the case.Tang Huan was the first to bear the brunt of the impact. Immediately, he felt a strong wind howling down, as if a huge boulder had been dropped from the sky.As expected of the Stage Two Martial Disciple!\"Wandering Dragon in Sea!\"Although it had only been a little while since he had fought with Tang Hong and the rest, Tang Huan had totally changed. He was extremely calm in his heart, and with a snort in his heart, he suddenly changed the momentum of the sword, and from the first move to the third, the tip of his sword trembled, and with a speed as fast as lightning, he struck at Tang Chao's abdomen. Under the flow of the Genuine Qi, a dense and sharp intent surged out from the sword tip, as though it was going to tear it apart Tang Chao's abdomen.Tang Chao did not expect Tang Huan's sword technique to be so powerful, his expression darkened, suddenly he turned his fist into a claw and swept it towards the sword blade with lightning speed.\"Bam!\"A dull sound of impact rang out.The moment the hand claw and the sword made contact, the two sets of Genuine Qi fiercely clashed, and the long sword was actually unable to withstand it, and immediately broke apart, leaving only a section of the sword hilt in Tang Huan's hand, while the sword was slapped away by Tang Chao and nailed to a pillar nearby with lightning speed.\"It broke?\"Tang Huan was slightly startled, but he couldn't help but laugh bitterly in his heart. He knew that the youth's weapon forging skills were poor, but he did not expect the longsword he forged would be so weak that it couldn't even withstand a single blow. No wonder the swords were only worth one gold coin.He had originally thought that the price would be too low, but now he realized that selling this kind of weapon for one gold coin was already a high price.\"Haha, second brother is truly amazing.\"\"This dog, how dare he fight against Brother Chao, he is simply reckless!\"Tang Huan was in a daze, but Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie all smiled, the moment Tang Chao's claws broke the sword, both of their feet landed on the ground, but they did not pause at all, their bodies once again leaped up, like a ferocious tiger, viciously pouncing towards Tang Huan.\"Lie down!\"A sinister smile flashed across Tang Chao's forehead as he struck out with his right fist once again. With the force of a thunderbolt, the angle was crafty and it smashed towards Tang Huan's chest like a heavy hammer.Tang Huan suddenly woke up from his stupor and could no longer hold back from complaining about the youth who had forged the longsword.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: 10Who let you go?\"Buzz!\"Inside the Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was spinning at high speeds, and the Genuine Qi gathered in the cauldron was once again charging out with a blazing heat. At this moment, Tang Huan could clearly feel a scorching warm current moving quickly along the Spiritual Meridian. In an instant, it had arrived at his left fist.\"Bam!\"The two fists made contact, and the Genuine Qi that was stored up in Tang Huan's fist roared out.At the same time Strength Qi spread out from the point of impact of the fist, an incomparably scorching aura burst out, and in an instant, the surrounding temperature seemed to rise by several degrees.\"Tap! Tap!\"At this moment, under the impact of the Strength Qi, Tang Huan also suffered a heavy blow and was forced back six steps before he managed to stabilize himself. However, Tang Chao, who was still in the air, was also blown back several meters before heavily landing on the ground.When Tang Hong and the other two saw this scene, they were stunned, their smiles frozen on their faces.Tang Huan retreated further. It looked like Tang Chao had the upper hand.However, Tang Huan had only been forced to retreat three steps after his sword broke, causing him to fly back a few meters, in order to cushion the impact.It looked like the two of them were evenly matched.Just how many Spiritual Meridian had Tang Huan opened up, and how many of them could actually contend against Tang Chao? Could it be that he, like Tang Chao, was also a Stage Two Martial Disciple? However, this fellow didn't possess any Genuine Qi in the past ten or so years. A few days ago, he was beaten half to death by them, so how could he become so powerful in an instant?Could it be that this fellow had always been pretending to be a pig?It was very easy to play as a pig for a few days, but to play as a pig for over ten years was not something an ordinary person could do. If that was the case, then this fellow was way too patient!When they thought about this, Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie almost simultaneously shivered, but following immediately after, they were so shocked by Tang Chao's words that they almost jumped up.\"True Fire? You actually merged with a True Fire? \"The collision just now had actually made his entire fist swell like a ball. The surface of his fist was charred black, the pain was unbearable, and not only that, there was also a burning sensation invading his right arm which had been set it on fire.As a Disciples, he naturally had experience that could not be compared to an ordinary person's. He immediately understood that he was injured by the opponent's Power of True Fire!To be able to fuse the Power of True Fire, other than the opponent having already fused with the True Fire, there was no other way.Fusing with the True Fire meant one could become a Weapon Refiner.There were so many people in the Tang Family, and currently, he was only a low level Weapon Refiner. But this bastard actually became a Weapon Refiner?\"Second brother, he, he is Weapon Refiner?\" Tang Hong called out as his eyes opened wide in shock.\"Brother Chao, could it be that your judgement was wrong?\" Tang Jiang said in a daze as well.Tang Junjie found it hard to believe his own eyes, and they did not see Tang Chao's fist that was placed in front of his stomach.It was one thing to play the pig for more than ten years, but he had actually disguised himself as a Weapon Refiner?In this world, the Weapon Refiner was an existence that was incomparably reverent. Even if it was a low level Weapon Refiner, they would still receive extremely high treatment in the Three Empires. Tang Huan who was originally called \"bastard\" or \"dog thing\" by them, would in the future jump onto their heads?They found it hard to accept such an outcome.\"You're right, I have indeed fused with the 'True Fire'.\"Tang Huan glanced at Tang Chao's fist and laughed, \"Tang Chao, to be able to taste the taste of the roasted pig's feet, you have to thank me!\"At this time, he was also extremely shocked in his heart.Although he had just broken through the fourth Spiritual Meridian, and he did not have the slightest bit of fear in his heart, facing this Stage Two Martial Disciple Tang Chao, he really did not have much confidence. However, what he did not expect was that after fusing the Power of True Fire with the Genuine Qi, it would actually cause such a terrifying killing power, crippling Tang Chao's arm in an instant.Hearing that, Tang Hong and the other two were also shocked, they just realised that Tang Chao was injured.\"Very good! \"Very good!\"Tang Chao endured the pain in his right arm, his eyes dark and cold like ice, and almost gnashed his teeth as he roared out, \"Tang Huan, you bastard, if you didn't fuse with a 'True Fire', then that's fine, but since you did, then your life is almost over!\"\"Hmm?\"Tang Huan's brows twitched, his heart shivered.Although Tang Chao's words caused the anger in his heart to boil once again, it did remind him. He reckoned that the reason why he was able to live until now, aside from being under the protection of the old blacksmith from the low level Weapon Refiner, was probably because he was still unable to cultivate the Genuine Qi.But now, not only did he possess the Genuine Qi, he had also fused with the \"True Fire\". The Tang Family, especially that malicious woman it was, would probably never let him off.\"Let's go!\" Tang Chao glanced at Tang Huan, then shouted and prepared to leave.\"Go?\" Who let you leave? \"Tang Huan regained his senses, the killing intent in his heart started to boil, he started to laugh coldly, and then he threw a punch straight at Tang Chao's head, in an instant, his punch was once again filled with the burning hot Genuine Qi.Seeing that, Tang Chao's face could not help but change, his right arm could not move, as though he was conditioned to move, he raised his right arm up, but before the fist rushed out, he realised that Tang Huan had already fused with the True Fire, and immediately leaped up, rolling to the side and dodging Tang Huan's powerful punch.\"Clang!\"The moment he landed, the sword at Tang Chao's waist was already unsheathed, the sword's body was surrounded with a faint gold light, it was extremely sharp, much sharper than normal weapons.\"Chi!\" Tang Chao's wrist turned, and with a slight tremble, the sword pierced under Tang Huan's ribs. The lesson just now, had already made him afraid to clash with Tang Huan's fist again.\"Low level weapon?\"Tang Huan's expression congealed and he growled. His footsteps quickened as he grabbed the abnormally heavy iron furnace not far away and smashed it towards Tang Chao.\"Ding!\"In the midst of the clanging of metals, Tang Chao swung his sword, causing the iron furnace to fly out and heavily smash onto a wooden table. Fragments flew all around, but Tang Chao's face immediately became pale white.The iron furnace weighed several hundred jin to begin with, and when it was thrown out like that, it became even heavier. He was from the Stage Two Martial Disciple and had even used a low level weapon. Normally, he would naturally be able to fly, but now that the injury on his right arm had affected his entire body and also affected the circulation of the Genuine Qi, his injuries immediately increased.\"Hu!\"But just then, Tang Huan pounced forward once again, wielding a giant hammer in his hand and smashed down at Tang Chao's face.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: 11Chapter 11 - Coward!\"Little Hong, quickly go back. This bastard wants to silence us by killing us!\"Seeing the gigantic hammer smashing towards him, Tang Chao was terrified, he anxiously retreated a step and used all his might to block it, but the fierce look in Tang Huan's eyes made him realize that Tang Huan already had killing intent towards him, and he immediately felt that something was amiss, and he could not help but shout out loud.When Tang Hong and the rest heard Tang Chao's words, they were all shocked.Originally, they thought that even if Tang Chao lost for a moment and was injured by Tang Huan's Power of True Fire, with his Stage Two Martial Disciple's strength, even if he was unable to defeat Tang Huan, it shouldn't be a problem for him to maintain a draw with Tang Huan. However, they never thought that Tang Chao would say such words in such a short amount of time.The situation had become so serious?\"Bam!\"In a split-second, the huge hammer had already struck the sword's body.Even though Tang Chao had already activated his Genuine Qi, he was still unable to withstand such a violent impact. As he groaned in pain, the longsword in his hand fell to the ground, causing his entire left arm to go numb. The stifling sensation in his chest almost made him spit out a mouthful of fresh blood.\"Little Jiang, Junjie, you two go first!\"In that moment, Tang Hong quivered and immediately let out a loud scream. Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie were still hesitating, but Tang Hong had already started shouting anxiously, \"Quick!\"Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie gritted their teeth as they ran towards the distance. Although they were not powerful, they were clever.They knew that now was not the time to hesitate and give in. If Tang Huan really wanted to kill someone, then Tang Chao would lose the ability to resist, and then they would be in danger. Only when Tang Chao had not fallen down would they quickly flee, fleeing as far away as possible.Tang Huan frowned slightly as he thought it was a pity. He did indeed have the thought of leaving Tang Chao and the rest here, as this would at least let the news of him fusing with the \"True Fire\" leak out a little too late. If Tang Chao had woken up a little later, he had a great chance of success.But now, it was obviously impossible!Even if he killed Tang Chao and Tang Hong, it would be difficult for him to catch up to Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie who had already escaped. Since this news was destined to be found out by the Tang Family, there was no longer a need to kill Tang Chao and her.But he couldn't let them go either!Tang Huan thought for a moment, but his movements did not pause the slightest, and his leg shot out like lightning.Before Tang Chao could regain his senses, his chest was kicked, and with a miserable \"Ao\" cry, the Stage Two Martial Disciple was sent flying out of the shop.\"Second Brother!\"Tang Hong screamed in shock and ran over to support him.At this moment, Tang Hong was panicking and regretful at the same time. If he had known earlier that Tang Huan had fused with the True Fire, he would have called for a few more people to come over.\"Pfft!\"Tang Chao opened his mouth, unable to hold back the surging blood energy in his chest any longer, and directly spat out a mouthful of blood, his face turning as pale as paper.\"Someone like you can break my arms and legs?\" Tang Huan walked over with a gigantic hammer in hand, his eyes filled with ridicule.\"You!\"Tang Chao was both embarrassed and angry at the same time.Seeing Tang Huan getting closer and closer, Tang Hong became even more frightened. A heavy iron hammer of several tens of kilograms would probably only take two tries to smash the two of them to death.\"Tang Huan, you \u2026 don't think that I'm really afraid of you! I'll fight it out with you! \"Tang Hong suddenly mustered his courage, took out his sword, and stood in front of Tang Chao.Tang Huan paused in his steps, his eyes fixated on Tang Hong's body. In the blink of an eye, Tang Hong was already sweating profusely, his face was pale white, his lips could not help but tremble uncontrollably, his legs becoming wet, as a pungent smell spread out.\"Coward!\"Tang Huan scoffed and curled his lips. With a wave of his giant hammer, the sword in Tang Hong's hand flew out.\"Don't kill me, don't kill me!\"The bit of courage that Tang Hong mustered disappeared. At the same time, he closed his eyes and screamed in despair, his legs bent and he was about to kneel. But before his knee even touched the ground, he heard a loud sound, and the ground also trembled. Following that, his collar tightened and his body left the ground, and a burning pain came from his face.\"Pah!\"\"Pah!\"\"\u2026\"A crisp sound echoed continuously outside the blacksmith's shop.\"Tang Huan, stop!\"When he first saw Tang Huan's hammer strike towards his brother, he was so shocked that his heart almost reached his throat. Fortunately, his hammer strike still missed and smashed onto the ground in the end, but even though Tang Hong escaped death, his misfortune did not end yet.Seeing Tang Huan slap one after another on Tang Hong's face, Tang Chao was extremely furious, and at the bottom of his heart, he felt an indescribable sense of humiliation.\"Don't worry, it's your turn soon.\" Tang Huan slapped Tang Hong's face again, and then smiled playfully at Tang Chao.\"You, you dare?\"Tang Chao's heart trembled, he tried to put on a brave front as he roared, but just as he finished speaking, he saw Tang Hong fly out horizontally and fall hard onto the ground, as he moaned in pain. Following which, Tang Huan walked towards him in large strides. That smiling face made him both furious and regretful.He was very clear that it was those words he said before he left that aroused Tang Huan's killing intent. If he did not say that much, he would have left this damn place by now.But unfortunately, it was too late for regret.After a short moment, Tang Chao could only watch as his neck was stuck in Tang Huan's grip, followed by the image of a palm swaying in front of his eyes.\"Pah!\"\"\u2026\"The burning pain in his cheeks was secondary, what made Tang Chao feel especially unbearable was the incomparably intense feeling of humiliation. In the family, although he was not one of the most blessed sons of the younger generation, he was still doted upon by the Lord s of the family.\"If Tang Huan has the guts, then kill me!\"Amidst the clapping sounds, Tang Chao's hysterical howls sounded out, and after he finished speaking, the normally proud and arrogant him simply fainted.\"Plop!\"Tang Huan swung his arm, throwing Tang Chao onto Tang Hong's body, smashing him, and causing Tang Hong to scream like a pig being butchered.After he slowly exhaled, Tang Huan's mind started working quickly.Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie had escaped. Soon, there would probably be experts from the Tang Family coming over.Tang Huan did not want to use the jade talisman left behind by the old blacksmith. After all, that thing could only be used once, and after using it, he would not be able to stay in the Furious Waves City anymore. Now, Tang Huan had fused with the \"True Fire\" and was about to become a Weapon Refiner.\"Go and get that amulet right away!\"As he thought about it, Tang Huan had already made his decision. He glanced at Tang Chao and Tang Hong with a cold smile, not bothering to close the blacksmith shop either.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: 12Chapter 12 - Divine Weapon Pavilion\"Whoosh!\" \"Whiz!\"Not long after Tang Huan left, two figures galloped over like two horses, fast as lightning, and their sleeves actually emitted a faint sound of something tearing through the air.They were two middle-aged men. One of them had a medium build, wore blue clothes, and the other was tall and thin. He had a horse face.\"Tang Chao! Tang Hong! \"Seeing the two people lying in front of the blacksmith shop, both the blue-robed man and the horse-faced man had a drastic change in expression. In a short moment, they had arrived beside the two.\"Uncle Rong! Uncle Hao!\"Tang Hong weakly groaned, and barely managed to roll over.When the horse-faced middle-aged man saw this, his expression became even uglier. Tang Hong's head was swollen like a pig's head, to the point that he could not even discern his facial features.The blue clothed middle aged man scouted Tang Chao with his black face and heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he was still alive and had fainted.After he rejoiced for a while, the blue clothed middle aged man's anger surged again. He glanced at the blacksmith shop and asked: \"Where did that Tang Huan go?\"\"He ran away,\" Tang Hong said weakly.\"Run? If we can run away, we can't run away from the Furious Waves City! Tang Hong, you stay here. The two of us will go and capture him. \" When the horse-faced middle-aged man heard this, his face turned ashen and he sneered. He exchanged a glance with the blue-clothed middle-aged man and sped away like a whirlwind, one person at a time.Not long after the two middle aged men left, two more figures ran in front of the blacksmith shop while gasping for breath. It was Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie who had escaped earlier.After they left the blacksmith shop, they did not return to the clan. Instead, they went to the nearest clan store.They were lucky enough to run into the patrolling Tang Family manager, Tang Tianrong and Tang Tianhao. Not only were they of the same generation as Head, they were even more so part of Stage Four Martial Master. When they heard that Tang Chao and Tang Hong's lives were in danger, the two of them did not dare delay and immediately rushed over as fast as possible.Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie hurriedly rushed, they were still a bit late.\"Brother Hong, where's Uncle Rong and Uncle Hao?\"\"He went to capture Tang Huan. That damned thing, he beat Second Brother and I so badly, I will not forgive him!\"\"With Uncle Rong and Uncle Hao coming out, he will definitely not be able to escape Furious Waves City! Oh no, I forgot to tell them about Tang Huan fusing with the True Fire.\"\"What's there to be afraid of? Uncle Rong and Uncle Hao are both Stage Four Martial Master, how can they be afraid of him?\"\"That's right, that's right!\"\"\u2026\"Of course, it was impossible for Tang Huan to leave the Furious Waves City, he had arrived at the northeastern part of the Furious Waves City with his fastest speed.On the cliffs by the sea, there were three buildings that were arranged in a shape. Below the cliff was the \"Raging Waves Sea\" between Glory Continent and the sea.Three buildings. The front one was a three story pavilion, and behind them were two palaces.\"Divine Weapon Pavilion!\"Standing in front of the pavilion, Tang Huan softly muttered as he looked at the signboard above the pavilion's entrance. The plaque was carved with three words, 'Dragon and Phoenix Soaring Art', in an imposing manner.This pavilion was ordinary, but its origins were extraordinary.According to the legends from his previous life, this \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" was a guild formed by all the Weapon Refiner s in the Glory Continent. It was created over a hundred years ago by the strongest Weapon Refiner s.As long as it was a slightly larger city, there would be branches of \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\". As the commander of the majority of Glory Continent, he had become one of the largest powers in Glory Continent, and could even be on par with the Three Empires Royal Family.However, the headquarters of the Divine Weapon Pavilion was located outside of the Three Empires.Tang Huan came here because he wanted to join the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".As long as the identity of the Weapon Refiner was accepted by the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\", she would be able to receive the protection of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\". With this talisman, as long as they were in a city with Divine Weapon Pavilion, they wouldn't need to worry about others finding trouble with them in the open.\"It's not even noon yet, the assessment examination for today should have yet to begin. Otherwise, we'll have to wait until tomorrow. That would be troublesome.\"While thinking, Tang Huan had already walked towards the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".There were no guards at the entrance of the pavilion. Furthermore, with the reputation of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\", there was no need for anyone to guard the entrance. The three words \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" were enough to scare anyone off.Thus, Tang Huan easily entered the pavilion.Behind the wooden table sat a young man who appeared to be twenty-five or twenty-six years old. His eyes were closed, and he was not moving even when Tang Huan came in, as if he was pondering about something.Tang Huan looked around, his gaze landed on the young man, and probed: \"This big brother \u2026\"\"What is it?\"The young man didn't even bat an eyelid.Tang Huan was speechless, but he still hurriedly said: \"This big brother, I want to participate in the primary Weapon Refiner s examination, may I ask where I should go?\"\"Next, the second floor!\"The moment the young man's voice sounded, a small black shadow was tossed over. Taking a look, it was a round black wooden plate with the word \"Exam\" carved on it. Tang Huan was overjoyed, the examination had not started. Otherwise, he would not have given the wooden token.\"Thank you, Big Brother.\"Not caring about whether the young man reacted or not, Tang Huan thanked him and then walked towards the stairs at the side in large strides.The second floor was also extremely simple. However, there was a row of prayer mats in the center, about twenty to thirty of them.What surprised Tang Huan the most was that there were already five figures sitting within the rows of prayer mats. There was a beautiful young lady, a mature young married woman, a handsome young man around seventeen or eighteen years old, a young man in black clothes who looked to be around twenty or thirty years old, and even a white-haired old man.In front of everyone was a black wooden board with the word 'Exam' written on it.\"There are actually so many people.\"Tang Huan also chose a praying mat to sit on and placed the wooden tablet in front of him. He couldn't help but feel shocked, even an old man this age came to participate in the low levelled Weapon Refiner assessment, from this, it could be seen how huge the temptation to become a \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" was.When they saw Tang Huan coming in, all of them looked back at him in a blink of an eye. Some of them closed their eyes to rest, some gently rubbed their palms, some with trembling lips, as though they were mumbling something.Tang Huan was not interested in talking either. After sitting quietly for a while, he realized that there seemed to be someone sizing him up, and subconsciously, he turned his head around. The first person he noticed was a pair of black bright eyes, and it was the young lady in the red dress who was looking at him curiously.Seeing that, Tang Huan unwittingly had a mischievous thought and purposely wriggled his eyebrows at her.The young girl wrinkled her nose, ruthlessly rolling her eyes. She turned around, but not long after, two pairs of eyes sneaked over. Tang Huan found it extremely interesting and was about to tease her a little more when he heard the sound of footsteps approaching him leisurely.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: 13Chapter 13 - Beauty Pavilion MasterVery quickly, a figure walked down from the second floor.Tang Huan opened his eyes wide in shock. The person who came was a green clothed lady who looked to be around 20 years old.Under her willow-leaf-like eyebrows were a pair of dark, beautiful eyes. The rippling of her eyes made her look like two limpid autumn waters, exceptionally alluring, and the skin on her face was as fair and tender as congealed fat.Under her delicate neck, her breasts rose furiously. Two round and full lumps seemed to want to break through their restraints and leap out. Through the collar of her dress, one could even vaguely see a snow-white skin and the gap that would cause one to be intoxicated.Once the soft bosom had passed, the graceful curve of her body first abruptly retracted, and then, rather exaggeratedly, it revealed an alluring curve, contrasting with her two round and perky buttocks. Her round butt went down, and her two jade-like legs kept alternating back and forth. Under the green dress, she revealed a slender and beautiful silhouette.In her palm was a wooden box, and she gracefully walked down. Her long hair flowed behind her head like a flowing waterfall, and her entire body revealed a mature and charming charm.\"The one who presided over the primary stage Weapon Refiner's examination has always been Furious Waves City. That Pavilion Master was said to be an old man, how did she become such a beautiful woman?\"Tang Huan's eyes flashed with a tinge of awe, but he quickly regained his senses and was stunned.\"Even though this is his first time coming to this\" Divine Weapon Pavilion, \"since he has made up his mind to become a Weapon Refiner, he naturally has some understanding of this\" Divine Weapon Pavilion \"situation.\" Divine Weapon Pavilion. \"In this Furious Waves City, I heard that he's a guy called Gu Yi. He's around sixty years old, and seems to be a high ranking Weapon Refiner.\"He wasn't the only one who had a surprised expression on his face. The other candidates at the side also had surprised expressions on their faces.Just as the few of them were puzzled, the green clothed lady walked over to them and sat down on a praying mat: \"Everyone, I am Qing Ye, Master Gu Yi has been transferred to the Heavenly Forging City Headquarters, this Furious Waves City is under my control, and everyone's examination will be conducted by me.\"As they spoke, Qing Ye smiled faintly and swept her gaze across the six of them.\"Greetings, Pavilion Master Qing Ye.\"Everyone realized what was going on and quickly bowed in greeting. However, some of them reacted slowly while others reacted quickly. Their voices were clearly uneven.At this moment, everyone was worried about the outcome.Different Pavilion Master s, the degree of strictness required to preside over the assessment was different. The previous Master Gu Yi could be considered to be more strict, who knew if the new Pavilion Master would be more lax or stricter.\"Since all of you are here to participate in the examination, I presume that you have already fused with the 'True Fire'?\" Qing Ye's beautiful eyes quickly swept across the six of them, her eyebrows filled with a smile.\"Yes sir!\"Tang Huan and the rest of the six answered at the same time.\"In that case, have you guys tried forging any low-grade weapons?\" Qing Ye squinted, and smiled again.\"Yes!\"Amongst the orderly replies, Tang Huan's response was especially eye-catching.Seemingly in the next moment, all of the ten gazes at the side landed on Tang Huan, and their expressions were all rather strange. They hadn't even forged a low level weapon, yet they dared to come and participate in the examination for a low level Weapon Refiner? It was one thing if he hadn't forged it, but why did he answer so boldly and brazenly?This fellow couldn't be here to cause trouble, right? He would be expelled very soon.A few of them were already gloating.However, what disappointed them was that Qing Ye did not have any intention of chasing Tang Huan away. She only glanced at him, then nodded: \"It's fine if you haven't forged a low level weapon before, as long as you can fuse with the 'True Fire', and pass the examination, you can still obtain a low level Weapon Refiner s.\"When the few of them heard him, they felt indignant, but those words were said by the Divine Weapon Pavilion Master, so no matter how displeased they were, they did not dare display it.\"Everyone, this first round of examination will also result in the melting of low-grade gems. After four hours, you will be able to enter the second round, and if you still succeed, you will be able to obtain the identity of a low-level Weapon Refiner.\"Qing Ye smiled slightly.Hearing this, the few of them heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed like this new Pavilion Master was not that strict. It would be enough to melt a gem in four hours.\"Crack!\"It was Qing Ye who had opened the wooden box in her palm, and a brilliant white light immediately burst out from the box.Immediately afterwards, an exceptionally intense cold spread out from the box. It didn't even last a single breath as a bone-chilling cold filled the entire space within a few meters.For a time, everyone felt as if they were in a cave of ice.\"Cold Jade Stone?\"The old man couldn't help but cry out. The other people's faces also changed drastically.Everyone had fused with the \"True Fire\", so they were able to resist the cold's attack. However, after they determined what kind of gem was inside, their hearts turned cold.\"It's the 'Cold Jade Stone'.\"Qing Ye's beautiful eyes shone, the corner of her lips hooked up into a faint smile, and she slowly said, \"Everyone, this is the content of the first round of examination.\"\"Pavilion Master, how can we do that in four hours?\"The old man with the white beard could not help but speak, \"Amongst all the low rank gems, although the Cold Jade Stone is not the hardest to melt, it is definitely at the top. For low level Weapon Refiner, even six hours might not be enough for them to melt successfully, let alone four hours. \"\"According to the usual practice, this kind of gem that is extremely difficult to melt will have to be tested for longer periods of time.\" The black-clothed youth also agreed.\"That's right, Pavilion Master. This is something that is simply impossible to accomplish.\"\"\u2026\"\"If we can't do it, then let's talk about failure.\"Qing Ye smiled indifferently, \"Everyone, in the past, there were indeed examples of people taking longer periods of time, but now, the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' has requested for all branch halls to strictly carry out the Weapon Refiner's assessment. Not only are the lower level Weapon Refiner's examination like this, middle and high level Weapon Refiner's are also the same.\"Upon hearing his words, everyone felt stifled and indignant.Amongst the five of them, the one with the calmest expression was the girl in the red dress. However, even she had a look of worry on her face.Tang Huan blinked his eyes a few times. Four hours was equivalent to eight hours and four hours was equivalent to using the \"True Fire\" to melt a \"Cold Jade Stone\".Well, it was hard!As he recalled the youth's memories, Tang Huan couldn't help but start to feel a little apprehensive.The biggest difference between a graded weapon and an ordinary weapon was that it had fused with a gem with a strange power during the forging process. In order to do this, one had to first use the \"True Fire\" to melt the gem, and then refine it.He was able to smelt low-grade gems and forge low-grade weapons. Naturally, this was not a problem.Otherwise, everything would just be nonsense.Tang Huan was originally full of confidence, but now he was a little uncertain. Although he had created a twelve meter tall totem flame from the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" of the Star Ocean Weapon Shop, it represented talent and not strength. It was a pity that time waited for no one. Otherwise, he could have tried to take part in the exam at home. If he remembered correctly, there seemed to be a low-grade gem in his master's room.Just as everyone had different expressions on their faces, Qing Ye's jade-like palm brushed past the wooden box and six balls of white light shot towards Tang Huan and the others at almost the same time.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: 14Chapter 14 - Cold Jade StoneTang Huan subconsciously wanted to take it, but before he could even stretch his hand out, the ball of white light suddenly stopped in front of him, and then slowly floated down like a feather, landing right in his palm.Tang Huan looked at Qing Ye in shock. This Pavilion Master's control of the Genuine Qi was superb, he did not know what her cultivation level was.However, Tang Huan was not in the mood to pay attention to this. A bone chilling aura completely attracted his attention. At this time, in his palm was a white stone the size of an egg. It was round like a pebble, sparkling like jade as it continuously emitted white light.Holding this \"Cold Jade Stone\" in his palm felt like holding an ice ball, but the chill it emitted far surpassed any ice and snow that Tang Huan had ever seen before.\"Everyone, the time starts now!\"The melodious voice that sounded like the chirping of an oriole was suddenly heard.Almost at the same time, a white jade plate flew out from Qing Ye's wooden box and gracefully landed in front of the six people. This was used to store the juice of the Cold Jade Stone.The old man and the others immediately gathered their thoughts and started moving.Tang Huan also took a deep breath, and suddenly placed the \"Cold Jade Stone\" between his palms. With a slight thought, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" began to revolve within the Dantian. In an instant, the ball of True Fire began to undulate intensely, and then, two thick streams of heat separated from the flames and seeped out of the cauldron. In an instant, under the guidance of the Genuine Qi, they followed the Spiritual Meridian and arrived at Tang Huan's two palms.\"Hu!\"The instant the two streams of heat drilled out of his palms, they turned into scorching flames, covering the \"Cold Jade Stone\" and even the two palms. The incomparably hot aura immediately diffused and the surrounding temperature actually greatly increased.Both of his hands were bathed in fire. Tang Huan only felt warmth but it was no longer as scorching as it was when he was fusing with the True Fire.\"Huh?\"A few meters away, Qing Ye couldn't help but exclaim in a low voice as surprise flashed past the depths of her beautiful eyes.The six of them moved almost at the same time, and of the other five, one of them only produced a small ball of sparks, while the other four did not even have a spark. However, this young man not only produced flames from his palms, the flames were so strong that they covered both of his palms.\"The speed at which he used the True Fire was actually this fast?\"Qing Ye's mind was slightly moved, and with a voice that only she could hear, she started muttering. The interest in the depths of her beautiful eyes suddenly became denser.The heat from the surroundings immediately woke the five people who were using True Fire.\"So fast!\"When she saw the big ball of flame in Tang Huan's palm, she couldn't help but let out a cry of shock. Her pair of black eyes instantly opened wide, and her small, dark red mouth seemed to be able to stuff down an egg.When the old man, young woman, youth, and youth who were further away saw this scene, they were also shocked speechless.\"Humph!\"A light cough roused several people from their stupor. The corner of Qing Ye's lips curled up as she softly said, \"Everyone, don't forget, this first round of examination only has four hours!\"A few of them woke up from their stupor and quickly withdrew their gazes.This exam only had a short duration of four hours. Even the slightest bit of waste could cause the exam to fail.\"Ah, my fire is out!\"The young girl in the red dress let out a soft cry. Her pretty face was filled with regret. The absent-mindedness from before had completely annihilated the small cluster of sparks in her palm. She had no choice but to start over.Tang Huan slowly closed his eyes, his mind completely focused.Inside the Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was spinning at a fast speed and Tang Huan had already pushed the ball of True Fire to the limit. Two thick and intense heat streams continuously overflowed from the cauldron and quickly poured into his palms. That lump of flame gradually expanded and quickly became as big as a washbasin.\"Hmm?\"Qing Ye's gaze roamed about, the curiosity in the depths of her beautiful eyes having been replaced by surprise.Not only was this guy activating the True Fire at a speed that far exceeded ordinary people, the flames he produced, could actually reach such a level? You have to know that he is not even a low level Weapon Refiner yet, but looking at the degree of intensity of the flames, he has completely reached the level of a middle level Weapon Refiner.That little girl from the Heavenly Forging City was known as the genius artificer who had exceptional aptitude and only appeared once in a millennium. However, when she participated in the lower level Weapon Refiner's assessment a few years ago, the flames she ignited were only at this level, right? Could it be that this brat was also a peerless genius that was on par with her?In the next moment, Qing Ye looked at the ball of flame again, at the center of the flame, was a white color, and not the same red as the surrounding area.\"No, this, this!\"In the next moment, her mind was greatly shaken. If she had not promptly covered her red lips, she might have been unable to restrain herself from shouting out loud. However, even though she had suppressed the sound of it rushing to her throat, shock and disbelief uncontrollably surfaced in her black and beautiful eyes.The white flame was not obvious, but it could not be hidden from her eyes.\"It actually has a physique that belongs to the Five Elements attribute!\"Qing Ye opened her beautiful eyes wide, a raging wave had already begun to rise in her chest, and her heart had become white. There was only almost only one possibility, and that was that she had been affected by her physique.As a Weapon Refiner, she was very clear about what this physique meant.For Martial Warriors with this kind of physique, wanting to fuse with a \"True Fire\" was beyond imagination, moreover, during the process of fusing with a \"True Fire\", the pain that Martial Warriors would have to endure was similarly beyond imagination, at least several times, maybe even more than a dozen times the pain of a Martial Warriors with a fire attribute.If it was a Martial Warriors with powerful strength, they could still use the Genuine Qi to resist the burning of the \"True Fire.\" However, if they wanted to become a Weapon Refiner, they had to successfully fuse the \"True Fire\" when they were in the Martial Disciple. Once the Spiritual Wheel condensed and produced the Spiritual Wheel, there was no possibility of them ever becoming a Weapon Refiner again.It was because of this that Weapon Refiner was so rare.Moreover, fusing with a \"True Fire\" was not something that could be done overnight.Even a fire attribute Martial Warriors like her, when she first fused with the \"True Fire\", was burnt to death by the intense heat, let alone a metal attribute Martial Warriors like her. Even if it was her, she would still have lingering fears when she thought back to that scene. She would never want to try it a second time.However, he didn't expect that the kid in front of him would actually succeed.From what she knew, the fastest person to fuse True Fire s should be the little girl from Heavenly Forging City.Even if this brat's speed was fast, it was already good that he was on par with the little girl. It was almost impossible for him to surpass her.For such a long period of time, who knew if this brat had endured such pain. For a normal metal attribute Martial Warriors, they would not even be able to endure a minute, and their consciousness would be muddled.Once they lost consciousness, they wouldn't be too far away from death.\"Drip!\"The drop of liquid collided against the jade plate and emitted a clear sound. Although it was slight, it appeared unusually ear-piercing in this quiet second floor where one could hear a pin drop.Qing Ye was suddenly jolted awake and when she looked closely, she saw that the \"Cold Jade Stone\" in Tang Huan's palm had already melted and droplets of liquid had begun to drip onto the plate below him.\"This kid is probably the first Golden Weapon Refiner in the Glory Continent. I've never heard of a Weapon Refiner with another Five Elements belonging to a gold attribute appearing in at least a few hundred years.\"Qing Ye put down her small hands that were covering her red lips, and took a deep breath.But immediately after, the corner of Qing Ye's mouth raised into a strange smile.She had lived for more than twenty years, and the most talented genius blacksmith she had ever seen was the little girl in Heavenly Forging City. Among the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\" of Heavenly Forging City, the totem flames she ignited were up to twelve meters tall, reaching the limits of \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\".But now, there was likely going to be another weapons crafting genius like her.Not only was it able to activate a strong flame that was comparable to a middle stage Weapon Refiner, it was also able to unleash a physique that belonged to the attribute of Five Elements. If the little girl from Heavenly Forging City knew about this, who knows how much of a shock he would receive.However, this brat was just about to take the examination for a low level Weapon Refiner, which meant that he had just started on the road of artifact forging, while that little girl was already far ahead. If this brat wanted to reach her level, he still had a long way to go.\"Drip!\" Drip drip.The crisp sound continued to ring out, and the five people beside him were soon alarmed again.The young lady in the red dress could not help but turn her head, and upon seeing the drop of white liquid on the jade plate in front of Tang Huan, she was once again shocked, but before she could even exclaim in shock, she shouted \"Aiya!\"With a sigh of relief, the young girl in the red dress didn't dare to look any further. However, she couldn't conceal the astonishment in her eyes.In less than a quarter of an hour, that fellow's' Cold Jade Stone 'had already begun to melt. This speed was simply too fast!The four people who were further away from Tang Huan were also staring blankly.However, they were also like the girl in the red dress, not daring to look more, nor did they dare to carefully observe Tang Huan's situation, lest they lose their minds, and cause the flames to extinguish, causing them to have to start over again.Suppressing the shock in their hearts, they continued to refine their 'Cold Jade Stone'.\"Drip!\" Drip drip.The sound of the droplets hitting the jade plate gradually became more urgent. At the start, there was a time interval of several breaths between every two notes. But the further it went, the shorter the time interval was. In the end, the sounds were almost continuous, and they also became increasingly loud.The more the old man and the others didn't want to hear, the clearer the voice became.Just by hearing the voice, they were able to determine that the \"Cold Jade Stone s\" in that fellow's palm were melting faster and faster. This caused them to be slightly annoyed and the flame in their palms flickered between strong and weak. On the contrary, it was the youngest girl who was the least disturbed.After a long while, a droplet of liquid finally fell from her palm.\"Drip!\"After another clear bird's cry, Tang Huan suddenly opened his eyes and opened his palm. He saw that there was no longer any traces of the \"Cold Jade Stone\" within the raging flames, but rather, there was an additional small puddle of viscous white liquid on the white jade plate below his palm.\"I'm done!\"Tang Huan could not help but reveal a look of pleasant surprise on his face. In a second, the flame in his hand disappeared, and then he subconsciously looked to the side. The young lady in the red dress had already placed a few drops of liquid on her plate, and the four in the distance still had nothing.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: 15Chapter 15 - The Tibetan FrontWhen Tang Huan melted the gem, he had always been concentrated on it, and only now did he see the progress of the people around him.Even the little girl who had the fastest speed was far from being able to compare to him. Looking at the flames that appeared in their palms, they seemed to be relatively weaker, even the little girl seemed to be the same.Tang Huan's mind raced, and immediately thought of his Dantian's \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\".Their flames were weak, probably because there weren't many True Fire s to be used at all times. However, with the help of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", he was able to move even more True Fire s. Only by using the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", would he be able to create even more fierce flames in his palms.It was no wonder when they heard that the one to melt in four hours was the \"Cold Jade Stone,\" their faces immediately turned ugly.Tang Huan was relieved, the True Fire that he could use was like a river, but the True Fire that they could use was like a stream, the speed at which they could move would naturally be as different as the sky and the earth.\"Little Brother, congratulations. You can enter the next round of the assessment!\"A melodious voice entered his ears, waking Tang Huan up from his reverie. Looking towards the direction of the voice, he saw Qing Ye with a picturesque look, smiling like a flower, and even sat there quietly, his entire body exuding an enchanting atmosphere.Other than the young girl who had already completely sunk in, the old man and the other three by the side were completely awakened by these words. One after another, astonished gazes fell on Tang Huan.\"Thank you, Pavilion Master Qing Ye.\"Tang Huan was beaming with joy, but then he could not help but ask: \"Pavilion Master Qing Ye, how long did it take for me to melt this' Cold Jade Stone '?\"\"About a quarter of an hour.\"Qing Ye smiled slightly, and pointed at the fist-sized hourglass beside her, yet her eyes were focused on Tang Huan, and her charming face had a hint of appreciation that was difficult to conceal.\"A quarter of an hour?\" Tang Huan was stumped for words. Only now did he realize that there was an additional hourglass beside Qing Ye, and the sand that was leaking out right now was only a small portion.\"A quarter of an hour?\"At almost the same time, the old man and the others also cried out in disbelief, and the gaze they looked at Tang Huan with couldn't help but contain an unconcealable astonishment.Just where did this fellow come from, to actually refine the Cold Jade Stone so quickly!Although this \"Cold Jade Stone\" was only a low-grade gem, it was still useful when forging high-grade weapons. In terms of difficulty in refining, it was definitely one of the top five low-grade gems. He only took fifteen minutes to melt such a gem!Everyone could not believe their eyes.It was rumored that the daughter most beloved by His Majesty, Princess Tang Yun, also took an hour to melt a \"Cold Jade Stone\" when she was taking part in the low-levelled Weapon Refiner assessment in Fallen God City. That Your Highness princess was a very famous genius refiner among the young generation of the Great Tang Empire.Yet, this fellow used half of the Princess' time!Sensing the surrounding gazes and then looking at Qing Ye, Tang Huan's heart could not help but thump.He suddenly realized that his performance was too eye-catching and did not seem to be a good thing. It was just that when he was melting the Cold Jade Stone, he had been completely focused and did not notice the passage of time.\"Little brother, what's your name?\" Qing Ye suddenly asked with a smile.\"Tang Huan.\" Tang Huan said subconsciously.\"Wu, Tang Huan, the second round of examination will not start for another hour or so. You can enter the 'Hidden Blade Hall' at the back of the pavilion to take a look, and this can be considered as an additional reward for those who passed the first round ahead of time.\" Qing Ye smiled as he waved his hand, throwing over a red figure.Tang Huan caught it and saw that it was also a round wooden plate with the word \"Exam\" carved on it. However, it had turned from black to red.\"Pavilion Master, I'll head there now.\" Tang Huan did not want to continue being stared at like this, so he immediately grabbed his wooden plate and stood up.\"Go.\"Qing Ye waved her hands, smiling from ear to ear.Tang Huan bowed towards Qing Ye and quickly left.The eyes of the old man and the rest followed Tang Huan's figure. The red wooden plate in his hand made their eyes turn red with envy.That \"Hidden Blade Hall\" was the place where the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" kept its treasures!According to the rules, those who passed the first round of the examination ahead of time would be able to enter the \"Hidden Blade Hall\" and stay inside until the end of the first round. Although the place had to go in empty-handed and come out empty-handed, but even so, if one was lucky, the rewards would be beyond imagination.For example, if he found a precious pill that was suitable for him in the Hidden Blade Hall, he could eat it. This was not against the rules of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".To the Hidden Blade Hall, every single one of them was extremely enticing.Unfortunately, even if one was able to enter, the vast majority of people wouldn't have enough time to search for treasures. In the end, they would truly return empty-handed. But this Tang Huan fellow was different. He had more than an hour and a half.Extreme shock and envy made the few of them unsettled, and the flame in their palms swayed. When Tang Huan's figure disappeared and they withdrew their gazes, the flames in their palms had long been extinguished.\"Ao, my fire has been extinguished again!\"\"We're doomed. We definitely won't be able to pass this time!\"\"If you fail the first time round, you'll have to wait for another three months before you can continue with the second time round.\"\"\u2026\"A few wails sounded.Seeing their situation, Qing Ye smiled, and looked towards the stairs once again, and muttered in a barely audible voice: \"Interesting, not long after taking control of Furious Waves City, he had already met such an outstanding genius, and I wonder what kind of background this boy has?\"Tang Huan was completely unaware of the effects of the red wooden tablet in his hands. With a few kicks, he ran all the way to the first floor.When the young man at the door heard the footsteps, he finally opened his eyes and looked over. When he saw the red wooden tablet in Tang Huan's hands, his eyes revealed shock that was hard to conceal.Tang Huan did not pay attention to the young man. Seeing the back door of the Divine Weapon Pavilion's first floor open, he directly went through it.Behind the pavilion, there were two halls. On the left was the Hidden Blade Hall, and on the right was the Wonder Artifact Hall.Tang Huan quickly swept his eyes over them and headed towards Hidden Blade Hall. A huge screen was placed facing the door, blocking his line of sight. On the screen, there were two arrows pointing to the left with the word \"hide\" and the word \"edge\" in front of the arrow pointing to the right.\"What do you mean?\" Tang Huan was startled, then casually walked towards the left.\"Cough, cough!\"A sudden cough rang out.Tang Huan was shocked, he immediately turned to look, only to realise that in the shadows at the side of the door, there was a person seated on a praying mat. It was a Black Costume Old Man, and his body was short and thin. As he sat there, his entire body seemed to have blended with the shadows, if one did not pay attention, it would be extremely difficult to notice.\"Junior Tang Huan greets senior.\" Tang Huan regained his senses and immediately bowed, then took out his red jade tablet.\"You are not allowed to bring out any items from the Hidden Blade Hall, do you understand?\"The short elder indifferently swept his gaze over it. His eyes revealed a ghostly light within the darkness. However, surprise flashed deep within his eyes.\"Understood.\"Tang Huan nodded subconsciously. He had only come to take a look, he did not plan to bring anything with him, \"Then, junior will go in now?\"\"Let's go.\"The short elder waved his hand, and his eyes slowly closed.Tang Huan took a light breath and moved towards the left. In a short moment, he had already bypassed the screen, and only now did he realise that the palace space was separated into many small rooms. The corridor was inlaid with white beads. The dazzling light they emitted made the inside look very bright.\"What exactly is inside?\"Tang Huan was suspicious, but he couldn't help but open the nearest door. The space inside was extremely small, only about four to five square metres. There were also several white beads inlaid in the room. Although there was no light coming from outside, the inside of the room was still as bright as day.What made Tang Huan surprised was that there was actually a furnace for forging weapons inside, the surface was a dark red color, he did not know what material it was made from.Tang Huan shook his head, closed the door and opened the second room.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: 16Chapter 16 - Profound Yang Flame EssenceOne by one, the rooms were openedThe more he read, the more surprised Tang Huan became.In some of the rooms, there were items such as hammers, pincers, and other tools for forging weapons. There were also various pills and herbs, but Tang Huan had seen most of them with various gems that possessed miraculous powers. In one of the rooms, Tang Huan nearly froze to death the moment the door opened. Compared to the gem, the melted \"Cold Jade Stone\" was not even worth mentioning.\"Creak!\"Tang Huan pushed open another thick and heavy door, and a scorching heatwave immediately assaulted his face, causing his clothes and hair to feel as if they were about to ignite. It was a good thing that the wood separating the palace was not ordinary, if not, the entire room, and even the entire palace would have been turned into ashes.He moved to the door and peeked his head out. Unexpectedly, there was a millstone-sized ball inside the room.The whole ball was bright red, crystal clear, and exuding a strong heat.\"What is this?\"Tang Huan suddenly realised that the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" in his Dantian was ready to make a move, the \"True Fire\" in the cauldron was also flickering. This sudden change in events allowed Tang Huan to faintly understand that the heat emitted from the ball could perhaps help to increase the level of the \"True Fire\" by quite a bit.What should he do?Tang Huan thought for a while, then his eyes suddenly lit up. The old man guarding the door only said that he could not bring anything out, he only wanted to absorb the heat from the ball and not take the ball out.Laughing, Tang Huan stripped off his clothes, went into his room and closed the door.\"Huh?\"In the shadow at the side of the Hidden Blade Hall's door, the short elder suddenly opened his eyes, and a smile that was uglier than crying floated onto his skinny face, \"This brat has good eyesight, he actually chose the room where the 'Profound Yang Pill Stone' is placed. The 'Profound Yang Flame Essence' inside the Pill Stone is indeed able to level up the 'True Fire', but it cannot be absorbed too much, otherwise, it will be harmful.\"Wu, he is only a Stage One Martial Disciple who has opened up four Spiritual Meridian s, it is already very good for him to be able to stay inside there for half a quarter of an hour.\"The short elder lightly stroked his long beard, then closed his eyes.Inside the small room, the naked Tang Huan was already sitting cross-legged.The closer he got to the ball, the hotter it became, and even with the fusion of the True Fire, the intense heat made it even harder for him to breathe. In just a few breaths of time, he was like a cooked prawn, his entire body was bright red, and the hair on his body released a burnt stench.Tang Huan forced himself to calm down and concentrate. Soon enough, a ball of flames materialized from \"True Fire\" in each of his palms.A moment later, Tang Huan's palms, which were wrapped in flames, gently pressed onto the ball. Although he was protected by the \"True Fire\", his palms still felt a bit of burning pain. Tang Huan did not hesitate at all and immediately activated \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" with all his might. Inside the Dantian, the cauldron was also quickly spinning.In the next moment, two streams of heat flowed into the palm of his hand and soared up along the Spiritual Meridian. In an instant, they converged into the Dantian's cauldron, quickly fusing into the True Fire.Originally, when he had melted the \"Cold Jade Stone\", Tang Huan had already consumed a large amount of True Fire s. Around the round Fire Seed, the flames were already rather weak, but the moment these two heat currents merged, the surface of the Fire Seed instantly surged with raging flames, and immediately reached its peak.Not only that, but with the integration of the two heat currents, even the fire spark had grown a little.Tang Huan was ecstatic, he tried his best to endure the burning sensation in the Spiritual Meridian, and continued to absorb the spiritual energy. The two heat currents entered the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" without any pauses.Unknowingly, half an hour had passed.\"He still hasn't come out?\"At the side of the Hidden Blade Hall, the short elder opened his eyes in surprise, and then gave a praising smile, \"This kid can really endure, to be able to hold on until now.\"\"It's been almost a quarter of an hour, and he's still inside?\"After nearly half a quarter of an hour, the short elder could no longer sit still, \"Could it be that after absorbing too many\" Profound Yang Flame Essence \", the Dantian could no longer take it and died from its body exploding? This kid has the talent to melt the 'Cold Jade Stone' so quickly and enter the Hidden Blade Hall. If he dies like that, that would be too much of a pity! \"\"Whoosh!\"As he muttered to himself, the short elder had already stood up. His figure flashed and disappeared, turning into a streak of light. His speed was extremely shocking.However, he left quickly and returned even faster.When he once again sat cross-legged at the side of the hall door, his face was already filled with unconcealable surprise: \"This kid is actually still absorbing 'Profound Yang Flame Essence', moreover, it's completely fine.\"Half an hour, half a quarter of an hour, two hours\"He can actually endure so many 'Profound Yang Flame Essence'?\" The Profound Yang Flame Essence is extremely strong, forget about low level Weapon Refiner, even if this old one was to absorb too much of it, I will still suffer from a backlash. My internal organs will turn into charcoal! \"\"But this boy, he still hasn't stopped?\"As time flew by, the surprised expression on the short elder's face was replaced with extreme shock. After a long while, he was finally awoken by the sound of footsteps. He looked up and saw the youth running out. His face was flushed red and his eyebrows and head were bare without a single strand of hair.\"Senior, I'm going out.\"Seeing the old man looking at him with a strange expression, Tang Huan could not help but feel guilty, he laughed awkwardly: \"I did not bring anything.\"The short elder stared at Tang Huan, his body motionless.\"Senior, I'm going out?\" Could it be that he had already discovered it? Tang Huan felt goosebumps in his heart, and while speaking, he was already probing the exit of the hall. Seeing that the short elder did not react, Tang Huan quietly increased his pace, and in a short period of time, he left the palace.\"Hu!\"After Tang Huan left for a while, the short elder woke up as if he had just woken up from a dream, and suddenly rushed up. In a few flashes, he pushed open the door and entered the room with the \"Profound Yang Pill Stone\" inside.The skinny old man's expression suddenly changed, he anxiously touched the ball, then his skinny face twitched, he painfully growled: \"This repulsive little bastard, he actually absorbed all the 'Profound Yang Flame Essence', not even a little bit was left for this old man!\"\"So many Profound Yang Flame Essence, even if it's ten million gold coins, it still wouldn't be enough!\"\"\u2026\"Vaguely, there seemed to be a roar. Tang Huan could not help but turn his head to take a look, and then, quickened his pace. He finally understood that the word \"hide\" on the giant screen meant all kinds of strange treasures, and \"edge\" probably meant a weapon.To be able to be placed in a weapon used by the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\", they would definitely be considered quite excellent. It would be a pity to miss out on such a chance to carefully watch.However, after entering the Hidden Blade Hall this time, Tang Huan was unable to compare to the amount of weapons he had gained from observing them.After completely absorbing all the heat in the sphere, the fire seed of the \"True Fire\" inside his Dantian cauldron had actually grown by a large amount. In the past, it was as small as an egg, but now, it was as big as a bowl and increased by countless times.Tang Huan was very clear what this signified, and therefore, guilt turned into guilt. However, after walking out of the Hidden Blade Hall, the smile on his face never disappeared.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: 17Chapter 17 - Low level Weapon Refiner\"Tang Huan!\"A loud shout was heard.The first round of examination had ended? He never thought that he would have stayed in the Hidden Blade Hall for so long!\"Greetings Pavilion Master.\"In a blink of an eye, Tang Huan immediately walked forward to welcome him.\"Tang Huan, you absorbed the 'Profound Yang Flame Essence' of the 'Profound Yang Pill Stone' in Hidden Blade Hall?\" Qing Ye sized Tang Huan up from head to toe, and the depths of his beautiful eyes flashed with astonishment.\"Profound Yang Flame Essence?\"The red dressed young lady who was secretly laughing because of Tang Huan's strange appearance, couldn't help but exclaim out loud when he heard these four words. His beautiful face was filled with surprise, she clearly knew that this kind of heaven and earth treasure that had a miraculous effect in raising the \"True Fire\".\"Pavilion Master, that thing is called 'Profound Yang Flame Essence'?\" Tang Huan was slightly dazed for a moment, and then, while stroking his smooth head, he gave an awkward laugh.\"Not bad, how much did you absorb?\" Qing Ye asked with some curiosity.\"Uh, I seem to have absorbed all of it,\" Tang Huan said with a confused expression.\"All?\"Qing Ye cried out involuntarily, and the curiosity in her eyes was also replaced by shock.The larger the Profound Yang Pill Stone, the more they would contain. The Pill Stone in the Hidden Blade Hall was extremely big, and it contained a \"Profound Yang Flame Essence.\" Even if dozens of low level Weapon Refiner s were to act at the same time, it would still be impossible to absorb it completely in a short period of time. After all, it could not be absorbed for a long time.If he absorbed too much without stopping, it wouldn't be long before his entire body would be burnt to death.However, he did not expect that not only did this fellow manage to completely absorb all of them within two hours, but he was still alive and kicking even now.This was simply a miracle!Could it be because Five Elements was a type of gold? However, this didn't seem to have much to do with his physique!\"Pavilion Master, I'm sorry, I also wanted to leave some alone, it's just that I was too engrossed at the moment, in the end \u2026\" Tang Huan laughed dryly, knowing that he was in the wrong.\"It doesn't matter. Within these two hours, no matter how many 'Profound Yang Flame Essence' you absorb, it won't be against the rules of the Hidden Blade Hall.\" Qing Ye regained her senses, laughed bitterly and waved her hand, then said with a smile that was not a smile, \"However, Hidden Blade Hall's Senior Mu Kui might hate you to death.\"\"Senior Mu Kui?\"The image of the skinny old man flashed across Tang Huan's mind, along with the roar he vaguely heard from the hall not too long ago.After giving Tang Huan another deep look, Qing Ye said: \"Let's go to Wonder Artifact Hall. Tang Huan, Gu Fei, as long as the two of you pass through the second round of examination, you will be considered a low level Weapon Refiner. \" After she finished speaking, Qing Ye was already walking in front with the wooden box in her hand.Seeing that, Tang Huan and the young lady in red immediately followed along.Gu Fei curiously gazed at Tang Huan from time to time. When they were near the entrance of the Wonder Artifact Hall, Gu Fei could not help but ask in a low voice: \"Hey, Tang Huan, how many 'Profound Yang Flame Essence' did you absorb?\"\"Not much, just a little.\" Tang Huan laughed.\"Liar!\"Gu Fei angrily rolled her eyes at Tang Huan. If she had really just absorbed that little bit of \"Profound Yang Flame Essence\", would Pavilion Master Qing Ye really have such a huge reaction?\"You think that I won't know if you don't tell me? Hmph, I will find out very soon.\"Gu Fei wrinkled her nose and snorted. She then raised her head and quickly walked two steps, leaving Tang Huan behind, like a proud little hen.Tang Huan snickered in his heart as he entered the Wonder Artifact Hall with Gu Fei one after the other.The Wonder Artifact Hall was the place where weapons were forged. Inside, there were all kinds of weapons forging equipment.Qing Ye brought Gu Fei and to an iron table, opened the wooden box, and a jade plate containing the \"Cold Jade Stone\" juice appeared in front of the two of them. Then, Qing Ye took out two thin and long swords from the large pile of sword billets s, and placed them in front of the two of them.\"This second round of the examination is very simple. The 'Cold Jade Stone' and the 'sword billets' will be fused. As long as you pass the examination, you will all pass. You are still limited to four hours.\"Qing Ye smiled from between her brows.\"Yes sir!\"Tang Huan and Gu Fei's expressions became serious.After taking a light breath, Tang Huan grabbed the sword billets. Although it was called a sword billets, it was more or less at the stage of complete forging. In this world, there were many ways to forge a weapon. Before quenching, the gemstone solution would be fused into the solution.Of course, even though it was simple, wanting to do it perfectly wasn't that easy either.After he looked at the sword billets for a while, Tang Huan put it down. Then, with a thought, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" began to revolve within the Dantian, and a hot stream that was even thicker than the one he used to fuse with the gem earlier flowed out of the furnace, spreading towards his right palm. An instant later, a large ball of flame rose from the palm of his hand.\"Hu!\"The roar of the flames immediately attracted the gazes of Qing Ye and Gu Fei.After knowing that Tang Huan had absorbed a large amount of 'Profound Yang Flame Essence', she could guess that this fellow's' True Fire 'had definitely risen to an extremely shocking level. At this moment, after Tang Huan had activated the' True Fire ', the flames that appeared outside the body had completely proven his guess.Not only that, the white at the heart of the flames had also become much brighter.However, Gu Fei was so shocked that her mouth gaped wide open, and she stared blankly at the ball of flames in Tang Huan's palm that was about the size of two washbasins. Originally, she thought that the flames Tang Huan produced in the pavilion were strong enough, she never thought that after going to the Hidden Edge Pavilion, the flames would rise to such a level.The extreme shock actually made Gu Fei completely ignore the color of the flame in the center of Tang Huan's palm.If she knew that the white colored flame represented Tang Huan's physique that was of the gold attribute, she would probably be even more shocked.Tang Huan was also shocked by the huge ball of flames he had created.When activating the \"True Fire\", he had learned the lesson during the first stage of the examination and wanted to keep a low profile. Therefore, he had already deliberately controlled the flames earlier, but even so, the flames were still so large. If he did not control them, the flames might double in size.Tang Huan laughed bitterly to himself, it was really impossible to keep a low profile.After a while, Tang Huan was too lazy to pay any more attention to Qing Ye and his gaze, he picked up the jade plate, and directly poured the \"Cold Jade Stone\" juice into his palm.There was no special trick to condensing this kind of Cold Jade Stone, just a fierce fire. If it was a higher level gem, then the refining process would be much more complicated, and the method and heat would be especially important.Tang Huan looked at the flame in his right palm without blinking, observing the changes to the juice inside.Time flew by, and approximately half an hour later, the flame in Tang Huan's right palm swiftly weakened, while his left hand held onto the hilt of his sword. Violent flames flashed within his palm, and actually covered the entire sword billets within it.After nearly half a quarter of an hour, the sword billets had become bright red.\"Now is the time!\"Tang Huan's eyes lit up and the flames in his left palm immediately dimmed. With the horizontal of the sword billets, his right palm, wrapped in thin flames, quickly brushed past the sword.From the tip of the sword to the hilt, he then turned the sword around, and from the hilt to the blade.After two times, the \"Cold Jade Stone s\" solution in Tang Huan's palm had already been completely smeared on the sword body, the white colored solution permeated into the sword body at a speed almost visible to the naked eye, and in just two or three breaths of time, the white color on the sword body completely disappeared.After that, Tang Huan's right palm was once again enveloped by intense flames, flying past the sword body's two sides. Although the fire on his left hand no longer appeared, the Genuine Qi in his body had been activated to its limit, and he continuously pierced his left palm back and forth between the sword blade's two sides.Tang Huan was completely focused. Other than the sword, there was nothing else in his eyes.\"Chi!\"After a long while, under both Qing Ye and her surprised and praising gaze, the sword in Tang Huan's hand pierced like lightning into the large barrel at the side that was filled with green liquid.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: 18Chapter 18 - Death by a single palm!\"This talisman has finally been obtained.\"When Tang Huan walked out of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion,\" his face was filled with a carefree smile. At this moment, a small black jade tablet already appeared in his hand.This jade tablet meant that he had already obtained the recognition and protection of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".Of course, this was only one of them.The second was the upgrading of the \"True Fire\". If the \"True Fire\" Fire Seed was the foundation stone, then the Hidden Blade Hall's harvest, was equivalent to having his foundation stone strengthened by more than ten times.If he did not have the large number of \"Profound Yang Flame Essence\", he would not have known how long it would take for his Fire Seed to reach such a state.Tang Huan was elated, he quickly walked down the stairs in front of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".\"Tang Huan, you finally appeared!\"A cold voice suddenly entered his ears.Tang Huan suddenly woke up from his stupor and quickly scanned his surroundings. Only then did he realise that a figure had already quietly appeared behind him. The person in front was a middle-aged man with medium stature and wearing blue clothes.Tang Huan had met these two a few times and knew that they were both Tang Family s in charge. The one wearing blue was called Tang Tianrong, and the horse-faced middle-aged was Tang Tianhao.The two of them were obviously here for Tang Chao and Tang Hong, and their expressions were extremely ugly.\"So it's you two, is Tang Chao and Tang Hong dead yet?\" Tang Huan laughed, then revealed a smile on his face.\"They're not dead, but it's hard to say.\"Tang Tianhao's horse face surfaced into a sinister smile, \"Little thing, do you think we won't be able to recognize you after you shaved off your hair? However, you sure know how to find a place, you actually came to the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' side, if you think that you can be protected by the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' just by coming here, you are dreaming. \"Tang Tianrong's gaze turned cold and he said in a low voice, \"Tianhao, don't waste words with him. Take him back to the clan and Head will decide what to do.\"\"That's right, we've already wasted too much time on this little thing.\"Tang Tianhao let out a cold snort, and extended his hand to grab at Tang Huan.\"Wait, wait. I fused with the 'True Fire' this morning, and just now, I have passed the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' assessment and become a low level Weapon Refiner.\"Tang Huan retreated back and shouted.However, as Tang Huan spoke, his eyes flickered with uncertainty, and he said, \"If you don't believe me, you can look at this!\" Saying that, Tang Huan took out the black jade tablet in his hand, \"Attacking me is disrespecting the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion', you all better think this through.\"After quickly shaking the jade tablet a few times, Tang Huan's eyes wandered around.\"Low leveled Weapon Refiner?\"Hearing Tang Huan's words, Tang Tianhao could not help but freeze for a moment, his claws frozen in the air.After being stunned for a short while, Tang Tianrong said mockingly, \"To fuse with the 'True Fire' in the morning and pass the lower level Weapon Refiner s' test in the afternoon, you think you're a genius in artifact forging? In his hand, there was a broken sign that he had picked up from who knows where, treating it as Divine Weapon Pavilion's badge. Tang Huan, do you want to go crazy being a Weapon Refiner? \"\"F * ck, you dare to bluff your father?\"Hearing that, Tang Tianhao immediately came to his senses, and upon catching a glimpse of Tang Huan's sneaky expression, he immediately confirmed Tang Tianrong's judgement. In a split second, he looked like he had been stabbed in a chrysanthemum, his face flushed red from embarrassment and anger. \"Little thing, kneel down!\"His footsteps moved, and Tang Tianhao instantly rushed in front of Tang Huan like lightning. His palm, like a heavy millstone, ruthlessly smashed towards Tang Huan's shoulder.\"Ouch!\"Instantly, Tang Huan screamed out in pain as his body flew out and heavily crashed onto the stairs in front of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion.\" His face was twisted in pain, as though he was severely injured.Seeing that, Tang Tianhao was startled, and looked at his palm in shock.He hadn't even touched Tang Huan's shoulder when Tang Huan was sent flying. Moreover, his palm had smashed down from above, so even if Tang Huan wanted to fall, he would have to lie down on the ground and not do it like he was now.What the hell was this guy doing?\"Little thing, do you think that by acting so pitifully, you can get the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' to help you?\"After a while, Tang Tianhao suddenly came to a realization and thought that he had understood Tang Huan's intention. He laughed sinisterly, took a step forward and fiercely kicked him.\"How dare you! How dare you attack the Weapon Refiner of my 'Divine Weapon Pavilion'?\"A deep and angry shout suddenly burst out in the air.In a blink of an eye, a short and thin figure appeared in front of the pavilion, and in a blink of an eye, the figure was right in front of Tang Tianhao and Tang Huan, and with a slap, Tang Tianhao did not even understand what happened, and shot out.\"Bam!\"After flying for more than 10 metres, Tang Tianhao's body fiercely smashed onto the ground, and slid a few metres along the ground. Finally, he stopped, and became motionless, not only was his face swollen, even his brain matter could be faintly seen on his head.Looking at the scene, Tang Huan was so shocked that his eyeballs almost fell out. A dignified Stage Four Martial Master like him was killed just like that, how strong was this Senior Mu Kui?\"Tianhao!\"Tang Tianrong was dumbstruck. His gaze moved from Tang Tianhao's body to the short and skinny Black Costume Old Man in front of Tang Huan.Tang Tianrong obviously knew this old man.He was a powerful being from the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\", and his name was Mu Kui. Not only was he a high ranking Weapon Refiner, his strength was also unfathomably high.\"Cough cough, thank you Senior Mu Kui for helping.\" Tang Huan came back to reality and forced himself to sit up with a look of gratitude.\"Senior Mu Kui, spare me, I really did not know that Tang Huan had already passed the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' test.\"Tang Tianrong was startled awake by Tang Huan's voice. He knelt down with a \"plop\" and lowered his head. His face was pale white and his body trembled. How could he not realize that he and Tang Tianhao had been tricked by Tang Huan at this time. This fellow purposely lured them astray when he spoke, in order to borrow a knife to kill them.\"Senior Mu Kui, he lied. I clearly showed my badge, but they didn't believe me.\" Tang Huan shouted angrily, looking extremely weak.\"On the account that you didn't make a move, I'll spare your life. Take him and scram!\" The Black Costume Old Man called Mu Kui fiercely glared at Tang Huan, and then, her gaze returned to Tang Tianrong as she coldly shouted.\"Yes, yes, thank you Senior Mu Kui for sparing our lives.\"Hearing that, Tang Tianrong felt as if he had been pardoned from a dream, he frantically crawled up from the ground, and then rushed to Tang Tianhao's side, grabbing his corpse from his shoulders, he ran away with all his might, as if he wanted to grow a pair of wings, and immediately disappeared from Mu Kui's line of sight.\"Senior Mu Kui, thank you so much. If you had come that late, I would have been finished.\" Tang Huan said with incomparable gratitude.\"Alright, you can get up now. He has already left, why are you still pretending to be pitiful?\"Mu Kui glared at Tang Huan again before walking past him onto the stairs. As he walked up, he scolded, \"You little bastard, you can also scram now.\" After walking a few steps, he snorted without looking back, \"In another two months, Furious Waves City will hold a match for the early stage Weapon Refiner's' Weapon Refining Competition '. You should prepare well so that you don't embarrass yourself later on.\"\"Yes, junior will definitely prepare well.\"Tang Huan laughed dryly as he crawled up, patted off the dust on his body, and watched Mu Kui's figure disappear before heading towards his residence in the northern part of the city.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: 19Chapter 19 - Dark WaveDivine Weapon Pavilion, Wonder Artifact Hall.\"That little bastard is not bad.\"Mu Kui observed the deep green sword in his hand, his skinny face was filled with an unconcealable praise. As he spoke, his wrist flicked and the sword vibrated with a humming sound, as a green light seemed to flow around the sword, a cold Qi instantly diffused around it.This was precisely the fused sword that Tang Huan had participated in the second round of examination.At this moment, there were only Mu Kui and Qing Ye in the Wonder Artifact Hall. The little girl called Gu Fei had already lost all her confidence after personally witnessing the process of Tang Huan's examination. Not long after Tang Huan had obtained the first stage of Weapon Refiner's badge, after trying for a while, she automatically gave up on the second round of examination and left the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".\"Not just 'not bad'.\"Qing Ye's charming and peerless face revealed an expression of amazement, \"It only took him about fifteen minutes to melt the 'Cold Jade Stone', let alone it. After all, it was a low level gem, yet he was able to completely absorb the 'Profound Yang Flame Essence' within the Pill Stone without suffering any injuries.\"\"How can you say that he's completely unscathed? That little bastard's hair and eyebrows are all gone.\" Hearing Qing Ye mention \"Profound Yang Flame Essence\", Mu Kui was so angry that he blew his nose and stared, \"This old man is so angry, there are so many\" Profound Yang Flame Essence \", at least we should keep some, after absorbing all of them, he should not be afraid of being pushed to death.\"Seeing him in such a state, Qing Ye couldn't help but laugh. \"Senior Mu Kui, how about I capture him and beat him up to vent my anger on you?\"\"There's no need for that. After all, that little bastard did not violate the rules of the Hidden Blade Hall. \"However, that little bastard truly deserves a beating. He actually used me to help him kill someone. What's even more hateful is that even if this old man knows that it's a trap, I still have to jump into it.\" Mu Kui scolded angrily.\"Puchi!\"Although Mu Kui scolded her with her mouth full of \"little bastard\", when he said those words, his eyes revealed a smile that even he himself did not realize. Qing Ye, who was observing closely, was able to see everything, making her feel that it was really funny.\"Good, little girl, so you were just messing with this old man.\" Mu Kui glared at him and said angrily.\"No, no, how could I dare to make fun of you?\"Qing Ye forced herself not to laugh and waved her hands, \"Senior Mu Kui, I feel that this Tang Huan can be heavily nurtured. Sixteen years old is just a Stage One Martial Disciple, and is indeed a little too weak. However, he has astonishing talent in the way of artifact forging, and during the second round of the examination, the timing at which he fused 'Cold Jade Stone' with his sword billets was grasped very well, and it is difficult to believe that this is the first time he is forging a low level weapon. \"After a slight pause, Qing Ye said, \"What is even more unbelievable is that not only is his flame extremely fierce, his Five Elements is also a physique that belongs to metal!\"\"Do you know where he came from?\"Mu Kui muttered to himself.Qing Ye smiled slightly, \"I've already sent Lu Yao to investigate, I think there will be news soon.\"\"Wu, let's see his performance on 'Weapon Refining Competition' two months later.\" Just as Mu Kui nodded his head, a figure hastily walked in. It was the young man who stayed on the first floor of Divine Weapon Pavilion.\"Lu Yao, you're back so quickly?\" Qing Ye was a little surprised.\"Pavilion Master, Senior Mu Kui, I just received an extremely shocking piece of news.\" There was still a trace of unconcealable shock between Lu Yao's brows, \"Just this morning, someone used a 'Fire Shadow Tatoo' in Star Ocean Weapon Shop, and activated a totem fire that reached twelve meters high.\"\"What?\"Qing Ye and Mu Kui were shocked when they heard it.The little girl from Heavenly Forging City, had also activated his twelve meter tall totem flames, and now another one had actually appeared in Furious Waves City?\"Furthermore, that person is called Tang Huan!\" Lu Yao threw another bomb.\"Tang Huan?\" Hearing these two words, Qing Ye and Mu Kui both took in a breath of cold air at the same time, their eyeballs dropping to the ground in shock.\"\u2026\"In the vast hall of the Western Tang Family, a few important figures of the Tang Family were gathered together. The atmosphere of this place was oppressive and heavy.Tang Chao and Tang Hong were sitting at the door. Although the two's situation had improved a little, their faces were still swollen, with a mixture of green and purple. Especially Tang Chao, who kept his head low and did not utter a word. The blacksmith shop's tragic defeat had caused him, who was originally in high spirits, to become extremely depressed.Tang Hong secretly glanced at the people in the hall and did not even dare to breathe.Every time his gaze landed on the corpse in the middle of the hall, a cold shiver ran down Tang Hong's spine. He originally thought that if Tang Tianrong and Tang Tianhao worked together, they would very quickly be able to capture him and take revenge.But unexpectedly, the two of them did not return. When they returned, Tang Tianrong was carrying Tang Tianhao's body on his back.What was even more unbelievable was that the Stage Four Martial Master's Tang Tianhao had actually been killed by a single palm from before, and the person who had killed him was precisely the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\", Mu Kui!Within the Furious Waves City, Mu Kui was one of the most powerful people and his identity as a high ranking Weapon Refiner caused people to be wary of him.\"Mu Kui, you've gone too far!\"Finally, an angry voice broke the silence in the hall. The one who spoke was a middle-aged man with a fair complexion and a refined and elegant appearance. He was the father of the two brothers, Tang Tianshi. At this moment, his face was extremely gloomy.This time, three people had died in Tang Family and the two injured were both his sons. Tang Hong was fine, it was just a superficial wound, but Tang Chao not only had the Spiritual Meridian s on his arms been burned by the Power of True Fire, even his internal organs had been injured as well.Because of this, Tang Tianshi became even angrier.\"Behind Mu Kui is the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion'. We, the Tang Family, cannot afford to offend him.\" A sigh immediately rang out. The one who spoke was an old man dressed in green.\"Is it going to end like this?\" Tang Tianshi's face turned green.\"Then what do you think we should do?\" The old man asked in a low voice.\"I \u2026\" Tang Tianshi felt stifled. If he really had a way, there was no need to vent his anger here.\"Alright, stop fighting. As for how we're going to settle this, we'll listen to Eldest Brother's orders.\"A tanned faced man slapped the armrest of his chair and said in a deep voice.This sturdy man was Tang Tianshi's third brother, and upon hearing his words, everyone's gaze turned towards the square-faced, middle-aged man sitting in the seat of honor.He was the current Head's Tang Tianren.\"I never thought that a moment of mercy would bring us, the Tang Family, such a disaster.\"\"Since rascal has passed the examination and become a Weapon Refiner, with the protection of Divine Weapon Pavilion, we cannot act rashly for the time being, so as to not attract the Divine Weapon Pavilion to retaliate against Second Brother.

    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: 20Chapter 20 - Weapon Refining Grand Master?\"Did that Tang Huan really absorb all the 'Profound Yang Flame Essence' in that 'Pill Stone'?\"In the southeastern part of Furious Waves City, in a courtyard within the Gu Family, an astonished voice resounded.\"Yes.\"Gu Fei lowered her head and weakly snorted.When she got home, she became like this. The Furious Waves City was one of the three great families of the Furious Waves City. As the only daughter of the Head, she had always been proud, and at the mere age of fifteen, he had already opened up nine Spiritual Meridian s.She even had a small talent in the dao of artifact forging.Ever since she succeeded in fusing with the True Fire at the end of last year, she started to learn how to forge weapons. Yesterday, she had finally forged a low level weapon. Today, she excitedly ran to the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" to participate in the exam. In the end, she was beaten black and blue and even gave up on the second round of the exam.It would be fine if he could defeat those few famous genius artificers in the Furious Waves City, but he was just an illegitimate child of the Tang Family.The other five participants didn't know Tang Huan's identity, but she knew that he had met him a few times over the years.Of course, every time he saw Tang Huan, it was always because he was humiliated and beaten up badly by the Tang Family. Although Tang Huan was covered with wounds every single time, he would never beg for mercy. This made her admire him and he had a very deep impression of him. When he saw Tang Huan today, Gu Fei was even more shocked.In her impression, Tang Huan could not even cultivate the Genuine Qi, yet he still came to participate in the primary Weapon Refiner's assessment?However, the situation after that was even more unbelievable for her.In just about a quarter of an hour, the \"Cold Jade Stone\" had been fiercely melted, and was far ahead of the rest of them. In addition, they had obtained the qualifications to enter the Hidden Blade Hall, and then, in the second round of the examination, they had once again used an exceptionally strong flame to refine the \"Cold Jade Stone\" juice, and then merged it into the sword billets with an extremely skilled technique.Tang Huan's performance was completely worthy of the title of Refining Genius.Even after Gu Fei returned home, she still could not understand, how did Tang Huan undergo such a huge change in such a short period of time?\"Girl, how big do you think that Pill Stone will be?\" The middle-aged man in white smiled.\"Probably only this big.\" Gu Fei was listless, she casually made some gestures, and she looked to be the size of a rice bowl.\"Wrong!\"The white clothed middle aged man stretched out both his arms and placed his fingers on his chest, \"The 'Profound Yang Pill Stone' in the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion', is this big?\"\"So big? Father, you're not wrong, right? \"Gu Fei jumped up, and looked at the arms of the white clothed man in a daze. This man was her father, and also Gu Family Gu Jingcheng.A Pill Stone the size of a millstone, how was this possible?Gu Fei's beautiful face was filled with disbelief. How could such a large Pill Stone contain such a strong \"Profound Yang Flame Essence\"? How could it be that it was all absorbed by a low level Weapon Refiner in less than four hours?Perhaps, this was the only way to explain it.\"Of course it's right, Father and Mu Kui are good friends, and that's what he said himself. Moreover, the Pill Stone s are extremely abundant.\"Gu Jingcheng said as he laughed, \"Also, Father wants to tell you a piece of news. That Tang Huan's' True Fire 'was successfully fused this morning, and that portion of his' True Fire 'was even awarded after activating the' Fire Shadow Tatoo 'of the Star Ocean Weapon Shop. The totem flames that he ignited at that time were actually up to twelve meters tall! Even more so, he is not a physique whose Five Elements is fire, but rather, metal! \"\"Twelve meters? Five Elements is a type of metal? \"Gu Fei was immediately stunned.Before she had attempted to fuse with the \"True Fire\", she had also attempted to use the \"Fire Shadow Tatoo\". The amount of totem fire she had ignited had almost reached four meters. But on the other hand, Tang Huan was actually able to reach twelve meters, which was three to four times better than him. It was fine just with this, but he actually had a physique that belonged to metal in his Five Elements, and he even succeeded in fusing with the True Fire!The disparity was too great!\"That's right, father was on the third floor of the weapon store.\"Gu Jingcheng sighed, \"So, girl, you don't have to care too much about today's failure. Not many could compare to this level of genius. He really did not expect that the illegitimate child who was abandoned and expelled by the Tang Family was actually a refining genius. Tang Tianren, that hypocritical fellow, if he knew about this, even his intestines would turn green from regret. Haha! This is great! \"\"It can't be?\"In the north part of Furious Waves City's Blacksmith Shop, Tang Huan's eyes were wide open as he looked at the two jade plates that he had placed on the wooden table in disbelief.Among these two jade plates, the black one was the low level Weapon Refiner's badge that he had just obtained, and the red one was left behind by the old blacksmith.Other than the color and the character on the front, the shape, size, thickness, design on the back, and even the patterns around the character on the front were all exactly the same. On his black jade token, there was a \"Low\" word, while on his red jade token, there was a \"Sect\" word.From this, it could be seen that the red jade token was probably the Weapon Refiner's badge as well.The word \"low\" on the badge represented a low level Weapon Refiner. From this, he deduced that the word \"sect\" represented a Weapon Refining Grand Master!\"This old man is Weapon Refining Grand Master?\"The instant this thought flashed through his mind, Tang Huan's lower jaw almost knocked onto the table. Weapon Refiner was divided into low, middle, high, grandmaster and grandmaster. Weapon Refining Grand Master was one of the top Weapon Refiner in the entire Glory Continent. It was an extremely rare and rare existence.If the Weapon Refining Grand Master was not in the Heavenly Forging City, or was even worshiped by the Three Empires's royal family, how could they live in such a small blacksmith shop like the Furious Waves City?This badge that was approaching the Weapon Refining Grand Master, perhaps he found it somewhere? Or was it something passed down from the ancestors?That must be it!Tang Huan came back to reality and found the most appropriate and likely explanation for the red jade token representing his Weapon Refining Grand Master's identity.\"I wonder where he went, and why isn't he back yet?\"Since he had made his judgement, Tang Huan's excited heart had calmed down, and he was too lazy to ponder over it anymore. He casually put away the jade medallion, and the image of the old blacksmith's rough face, full of sideburns, flashed through his mind. It originated from the young man's memories, and made him miss that old man.After a long while, Tang Huan finally calmed himself down and started cultivating.The identity of a low level Weapon Refiner was equivalent to providing him with a guarantee. As long as hshedid not leave the Furious Waves City, she did not have to worry about retaliation from the Tang Family. Even though Tang Family was one of the three great families of the Furious Waves City, he did not dare to go against the mighty \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\".Therefore, Tang Huan could confidently and boldly stay in this blacksmith shop, peacefully consolidating his own cultivation.Just today, not only had he fused with the \"True Fire\", he had also opened up a line of Spiritual Meridian, and had even absorbed a huge amount of \"Profound Yang Flame Essence\". All of this happened too quickly, and he needed to spend a good amount of time to make his foundation even firmer.For the next few days, Tang Huan stayed in the smithy as he did not leave.As expected, the Tang Family was intimidated by the fame of \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" and did not take revenge. However, the news of him activating the twelve meter long totem flame in the Star Ocean Weapon Shop had already spread throughout the city, and there were even more Martial Warriors who came to this place.After finding out that he was already a low-ranked Weapon Refiner, there were even more people looking for him to forge low-ranked weapons.However, he had never truly forged a low level weapon, how could he dare to agree to it? In the end, Tang Huan was unable to deal with any further troubles, so he simply closed the shop.Unknowingly, ten days had already passed.In the early morning, in the courtyard, Tang Huan wielded the sword in his hand as he leapt forward like a dragon, unleashing the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" to its fullest extent. With a flash of his sword, the \"chi chi\" sound of the sword tip lacerating through the air sounded one after another.\"Crack!\"The moment the last movement was executed, a clear cracking sound came out, the longsword in Tang Huan's hand broke once again, and this was the third sword that he had broken in the past ten days.\"We can't wait any longer!\"Tang Huan shook his head speechlessly, and muttered to himself, \"My cultivation has almost been consolidated, it's just nice for me to forge myself a low level weapon.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: 21Chapter 21 - Five Gems, try it!Not long after, Tang Huan found five low grade gems from the old blacksmith's room.Amongst them were Ink Spirit Stone that were as black as ink, Fire Cloud Stone that were as red as fire, Golden Red Stone that were as colorful as a rainbow, Shadow Moon Stone that looked like crescent moons, and Thunder Light Stone that were brimming with purple intent and looked like lightning.Each rock contained a different amount of power. After fusing them with a weapon, the effects would also be different.Tang Huan thought about it for a moment and decided to choose the Fire Cloud Stone.When Fire Cloud Stone and weapons fuse, the weapon will release a scorching heat.If it was activated with the Genuine Qi that contained the Power of True Fire, the temperature of the weapon would greatly increase. Unfortunately, other than the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\", Tang Huan did not have any other battle skill that could match this type of weapon.Amongst the five low-ranked gems, the most effective one was the Thunder Light Stone, followed by the Golden Red Stone, and then the Shadow Moon Stone. The Fire Cloud Stone could only be ranked fourth, only slightly stronger than the Ink Spirit Stone.But even so, the Fire Cloud Stone was currently Tang Huan's most suitable choice.To fuse with a Fire Cloud Stone's weapon, the True Fire could still increase its effectiveness, but to fuse with weapons from other gems, one had to learn a corresponding battle skill. Otherwise, a low level weapon would at most be stronger in terms of material, and would not be able to display much more power than an ordinary weapon.For a good weapon, one must have a matching battle skill in order to display its greatest power.While thinking, Tang Huan had already brought the gem to the shop in front.Since the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" was a sword technique, he naturally had to forge a sword in order to succeed. Before using the Fire Cloud Stone s, Tang Huan decided to use a gem to practice.To fuse the True Fire, one had to rely on their tough willpower and the endurance of their body. If they failed, at least the Spiritual Meridian would be damaged, and at most, their soul would be destroyed.Forging a graded weapon also had a chance of failure. Furthermore, the chances of failure were not small.The higher the grade of the weapon, the more precious the material used. If the weapon failed, the losses would be even more severe.If you added them up, the materials needed to forge a weapon would be hundreds of millions of gold coins. If you failed, you would probably forge a low-grade weapon that was only worth a few hundred gold coins.If an ordinary weapon was not forged well and it could be reforged again, if the grade of the weapon failed, then it would truly fail.According to what was said in his previous life, during the process of fusing with a gem, the molecular structure of the weapon had already undergone a miraculous change. If he were to forge it again, it would be no different from scrap metal.Tang Huan had a deep understanding of this point.When he was at the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" realm, he used the True Fire to burn the sword billets to a certain extent. Then, he discovered that countless tiny holes had appeared on the sword billets, just like the pores on a human body.If the fire was too strong, the material of the weapon would be damaged.When those holes were expanded to their limits, he had to daub the gemstone sap onto them at lightning speed, allowing the sap to seep into those holes. Just penetrating them was not enough, they still had to be completely fused with the material of the weapon. This process required a tacit understanding between the Genuine Qi and the True Fire.That day during the second round of the examination, Tang Huan performed very well.However, if he allowed Tang Huan to repeat himself, he wasn't confident that he would be able to do it to such a degree.The key to forging a high grade weapon was to forge the equipment base to the point where it did not contain any impurities. The second was to refine the gem to its home and the third was to take advantage of the time the gem was smeared on the equipment base.Fourth, during the process of fusing the equipment base and the gemstone sap, there was a need for the Genuine Qi and the True Fire to have a tacit understanding.Different weapons, different gems, their methods of coordination were all different too. Even if it was a similar type of weapon that could fuse together with similar gems, no one would be able to teach it to him. It all depended on Weapon Refiner's experience and comprehension ability.Finally, the quenching liquid should be suitable, and the quenching time should be seized.As long as he failed in one of these areas, the quality of the weapon would be reduced, and even the forging of the weapon would fail.Moreover, this was only the simplest method of forging.It was said that some of the more powerful Weapon Refiner s did not use the gemstone juice on the weapon, but rather left grooves on it, refining it before reforming it and inserting it onto the equipment base. It was said that this kind of weapon could constantly improve its quality.Tang Huan had only heard the old blacksmith mention this method before, he had never seen this kind of weapon before.\"Let's try forging a long rod with the Ink Spirit Stone first.\"Tang Huan quickly calculated in his heart. Some gems were suitable for all types of weapons, but some gems were suitable for forging spears. Some gems were suitable for forging swords.Since he had made his decision, Tang Huan started to take action immediately.Inside the blacksmith shop, clanging sounds quickly came out. The equipment base s that the young man previously made were good at forging ordinary weapons, but they were still lacking when it came to low grade weapons. Tang Huan had to forge them again, and when he worked with the Power of True Fire, he had to completely remove the impurities in the billet.\"Bam!\"Noon, the blacksmith shop that was quiet for a while suddenly let out a loud noise.Tang Huan's face was pitch black, while the pitch black rod in front of him was emitting black smoke nonstop. The pole's body was covered with countless cracks, densely packed like a spider web.\"I failed.\"After a long while, Tang Huan dispiritedly picked up the long rod. With just a light shake, the rod that was filled with cracks turned into countless pieces of varying sizes, falling onto the ground.He had originally thought that the value of \"Ink Spirit Stone\" was the lowest, and even if he failed, his loss wouldn't be too great.But he did not expect that in the end, he would actually fail, and the reason for the failure was rather laughable. It was that he had smeared the Ink Spirit Stone's juice on it for too long. Before he could finish applying the medicine, the dense and minute holes on the rod had been burnt to the limit by the True Fire.It was only until he failed that Tang Huan finally realized that he was forging a rod, not a sword.The length of the staff was several times that of the sword, and the time it took to apply the gemstone juice was also much longer. Naturally, the time it took to apply it was different from when it was used to forge the sword.\"Fifty gold coins gone!\"muttered bitterly. His losses were not big, but compared to that, even the cheapest 'Ink Spirit Stone' would require 50 gold coins to buy it.\"Damn it, let's do it again. This time, we'll use 'Shadow Moon Stone' to forge the sword!\"\"\u2026\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: 22Chapter 22 - Melt Spirit Liquid\"This time, it's definitely going to be successful!\"This was the fourth low grade weapon that Tang Huan had consecutively forged.After losing that \"Ink Spirit Stone\", Tang Huan failed two more times, losing both his Shadow Moon Stone s.When he was forging the axe using the \"Golden Red Stone\", when the equipment base was fusing with the gem juice, the coordination of the Genuine Qi and the True Fire went awry, and he failed once again.Having failed three times, Tang Huan realized that he had been extremely lucky that day when he passed the examination.However, even though he had consecutively failed, not only was Tang Huan not discouraged in the slightest, his interest had even increased greatly.When he was on Earth in his previous life, he had experienced countless failures. It was because of his persistence and perseverance that he had become a famous master swordsmith on Earth at such a young age. Now that he was in Glory Continent, how could Tang Huan be defeated so many times?After every failure, Tang Huan would carefully learn from his mistakes.By the fourth time, Tang Huan was already extremely confident. Although the process of forging couldn't be said to be flawless, but there was nothing to criticize either. Tang Huan was very satisfied.Right now, the long blade was in the process of being quenched. As soon as the quenching was completed, a low-grade weapon would be produced.Tang Huan stood beside the barrel with a smile on his face, continuously calculating the time in his heart.Because that piece of \"Thunder Light Stone\" was relatively large, Tang Huan deliberately forged a heavy weapon. The weight of the blade exceeded thirty kilograms, and from the hilt to the tip, the length of the blade reached one and a half meters. However, the widest part of the blade was more than fifteen centimeters. If this weapon was paired with a \"Thunder Light Stone,\" the power would definitely be extraordinary.\"Now is the time!\"Tang Huan's eyes congealed, his right hand immediately reaching into the water bucket, grabbing the blade out.In the next moment, Tang Huan was immediately dumbfounded.This entire long blade was extremely black, it did not even have a hint of the elegant demeanor of a low level weapon. From this long blade, Tang Huan could not sense any hint of the berserk intent of lightning.\"Another failure? How is that possible? \"Tang Huan looked at his long blade in a daze, his face was filled with surprise, he could not believe his eyes, \"Could it be that something went wrong?\"After a while, Tang Huan took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down, and slowly memorized the process of forging the long blade.\"The forging of equipment base, the refining of precious stones, the smearing of sap, the fusion of sap, and the quenching of equipment base have all been chosen well. This means that before quenching, there are no problems.\"\"Could it be that the process of quenching is too long or too short?\"Tang Huan thought, he was not sure.In the past, whether it was on Earth in his previous life or in the Glory Continent, he would only forge normal weapons. As long as there were no problems with the liquid quenching, then there was no possibility of him failing the quenching of ordinary weapons.But now, it was the first time that he had tried to temper a low level weapon, so Tang Huan did not dare guarantee that he could grasp the timing accurately.While he was thinking, Tang Huan's eyes slightly closed, his palm was filled with Genuine Qi, sweeping across the blade time and time again.Not long after, a flame ignited on Tang Huan's palm.\"I understand, there's a problem with the liquid!\"After a long while, Tang Huan suddenly shouted in realization, and ran towards the backyard like a wisp of smoke.Not long later, Tang Huan ran back again, holding a black jade jar, he opened it up and took a look, there was some almost transparent liquid inside.\"That's right, this is it.\"Tang Huan beamed. The transparent liquid in the jar should be called 'Melt Spirit Liquid'.Before this, although the youth was extremely interested in forging, he had never been able to open the Spiritual Meridian and cultivate it. The old blacksmith had also not imparted him much knowledge on how to forge graded weapons, but had only taught him how to forge common weapons. Unfortunately, although Tang Huan had a bit of strength, his perception was not high. The ordinary weapons that he forged were also of an ordinary quality, which made the old blacksmith teach him even less.The young man did not have any friends in the Furious Waves City, nor did anyone communicate with him. All Tang Huan knew was that the old blacksmith could only casually mention about this to the young man after lunch.In this regard, the youth's knowledge was truly lacking.Just like this \"Melt Spirit Liquid\", the old blacksmith had once mentioned that if the water quality was ordinary, he would have to add it into the mix before quenching the lower tier weapon.Tang Huan thought back to when he went to the old blacksmith's room to look for gems and saw the contents of the jar. Only then did he remember the unintentional words the old blacksmith said a few years ago.Thinking back to the dosage that the old blacksmith mentioned, Tang Huan poured a little of the \"Melt Spirit Liquid\" in, and the transparent liquid quickly dispersed and blended into the water, and with the addition of the \"Melt Spirit Liquid\", the water in the bucket started to sparkle.\"With this' Melt Spirit Liquid ', I can definitely succeed!\"Tang Huan closed the lid on the jar and clenched his teeth as he waved his fist a few times. Then, he fiercely looked at the only \"Fire Cloud Stone\" remaining, that was a cluster of crystals.\"Ding!\" Dong!The sound of bells rang out once again in the blacksmith's shop.Unknowingly, it was already evening.\"Success!\" We finally succeeded! \"Finally, a joyous laugh echoed throughout the blacksmith's shop. Beside the huge barrel, Tang Huan was dancing with joy.At the moment, Tang Huan was holding onto a broadsword.The entire sword was about a meter long and as wide as a palm. The entire sword was painted with a dark red color, and not only was it faintly red in color, it was also continuously emitting a fiery aura.This broadsword was one that Tang Huan had just forged using a \"Fire Cloud Stone.\"\"After wasting hundreds of gold coins, I've finally forged it!\"After a while, Tang Huan finally calmed down from his excitement, but there was still a smile on his face.Just thinking about the four gems that he had lost consecutively, Tang Huan couldn't help but feel some pain. One was a \"Ink Spirit Stone\" for 50 gold coins, one was a \"Shadow Moon Stone\" for 90 gold coins, one was a \"Golden Red Stone\" for 150 gold coins, and one was a \"Thunder Light Stone\" for 300 gold coins.The amount of gems lost here was close to six hundred gold coins, which was more than the three weapons that Tang Huan had sold a few days ago.\"Since it has fused with a 'Fire Cloud Stone', then it is called 'Fire Cloud Sword'.\"Tang Huan muttered. On a whim, he immediately waved the Fire Cloud Sword, using the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" nonstop in the smithy.In a split-second, amidst the hissing sounds of the sword, a blazing heat spread out crazily.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: 23Chapter 23 - Promotion of Stage Two Martial DiscipleFinally, he had a low level weapon of his own, and furthermore, it was a low level weapon forged by himself. The joy in Tang Huan's heart could not be described with words.That night, Tang Huan slept soundly with the Fire Cloud Sword in his arms, and even woke up several times from his sleep with a smile on his face.The next day, as the sun was about to rise, Tang Huan had already woken up early. Using the Fire Cloud Sword, he practiced \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" several times consecutively before starting to cultivate \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\".\"Hu!\"This Genuine Qi was actually like a surging torrent, rushing forward unstoppably.Tang Huan could only feel an extremely weak sensation of obstruction as the fifth Spiritual Meridian was already linked, and the current of the Genuine Qi, after passing the fifth Spiritual Meridian, almost didn't stop at all as it rushed to the sixth Spiritual Meridian.This time, the obstruction in his meridians increased by a lot, but it was still unable to stop the flood of Genuine Qi.\"Boom!\"The torrent seemed to pour down from an extremely high place, with the force of toppling mountains and overturning seas, as it continuously roared forward.After almost half a quarter of an hour, the sixth Spiritual Meridian was finally cleared.\"To open six meridians is to become a Stage Two Martial Disciple!\"Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief, a faint smile appearing between his brows.He had expected such an outcome. Actually, ever since he had returned from the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\", he had faintly felt that he could have opened the fifth Spiritual Meridian at that time, and after ten days of cultivation, he would have reached the sixth Spiritual Meridian.It was because of this that he had been delayed for two days to forge a low-grade weapon.However, opening Spiritual Meridian was easy, but wanting to widen it was not something that could be done overnight.To date, he had consecutively opened two Spiritual Meridian s. He would have to cultivate for at least ten days to half a month before her Spiritual Meridian could reach the same level as the sixth Spiritual Meridian.\"With the expansion of the Spiritual Meridian, the Genuine Qi is at least four times stronger than before.\"Feeling the surging Genuine Qi in her body, Tang Huan could not help but reveal a strong smile. Just thinking of Tang Family calmed him down.A mere Stage Two Martial Disciple, to a Tang Family, was not even worth mentioning.To the Human Clan, the first to third stage represented the Martial Disciple, the fourth to sixth stage represented the Martial Master, and the seventh stage represented the Great Martial Master.\"Tang Family is so strong, it's not easy to make that malicious woman kneel in front of her mother's grave. Not only do you have to be strong, you also have to have your own power.\"\"If you want to raise your strength, you need to rely on the 'Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art' and the 'Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon'. These two low level techniques obviously cannot be used. You must think of a way to obtain stronger techniques.\" In addition, he would also need to continuously improve his refining strength. The powerful Weapon Refiner can easily gather a force. \"After a while, Tang Huan left the blacksmith shop.Before he left, he brought along some gold coins and gave the Fire Cloud Sword a sword sheath. He concealed the sword's edge and warmth and wrapped it around his shoulder.After casually eating some food on the way, Tang Huan came to the old fatty's weapon shop.\"Little Tang, what kind of weapon are you selling now?\" Fat Old Man smiled as he looked at Tang Huan's package, as if he saw an alluring pile of gold.\"Bam!\"Tang Huan did not say a word and placed the package on the counter.Seeing the sword sheath's wide sword, a strange look flashed past his eyes. He impatiently grabbed the sword hilt and unsheathed the sword sheath, the red light immediately piercing into his eyes. The red light was immediately accompanied by a blazing heat.\"Low level weapon? And it's even a low-grade high-grade weapon? \"The Fat Old Man exclaimed and blurted out, \"Little Tang, you've only fused with the True Fire for a few days and you've already forged such a low-grade weapon?\"\"How do you know that I've fused with the 'True Fire', and that I've forged this sword?\"Tang Huan said in surprise.After he finished speaking, Tang Huan knew that this question was a little unnecessary. The movements of the Star Ocean Weapon Shop that day had practically spread throughout the entire Furious Waves City, although the business inside the old fatty's weapon shop was average, there were still frequent customers who visited it, it was impossible that he had not heard of them at all.Sure enough, the old fatty laughed, winked at Tang Huan and said, \"A twelve meter long totem flame, who doesn't know about it in Furious Waves City? Little Tang, you are a famous person in Furious Waves City now, and you will soon become the famous person in the entire Great Tang Empire, or even in the entire Glory Continent.\"Tang Huan rolled his eyes in annoyance: \"Tell me, how's the sword I forged?\"\"Yes, it was so-so.\"Fat Old Man put down her sword casually, and said with a smile, \"Little Tang, since you and I are so familiar with each other, I will take a loss. Two hundred gold coins it is.\" At the end, Fat Old Man had a look of \"I am very generous, you brat\".They had not seen each other for more than ten days, but the old fatty's ability to speak lies with his eyes wide open had not regressed at all. The \"upper\" that he had mentioned a few seconds ago had now turned into \"so-so\".Resisting the urge to smash his fat face into pieces, Tang Huan grabbed the Fire Cloud Sword and quickly sheathed it with his sword. He laughed and said: \"I keep this sword for my own use, it's not for sale.\"\"How can I not sell it?\"Fat Old Man's eyes stared wide open, she was a little anxious, holding onto the sword hilt tightly, \"Little Tang, if you think the price is too low, I can suffer a bit more. Un, how about adding 20 gold coins? No? Okay, two hundred and fifty gold coins. You're the ruthless one. Three hundred gold coins! \"This is the highest price you can offer. Your price is just so-so. Being able to sell for this much is already a big deal for me.\"\"It's really not for sale!\"Seeing the anxious look on the Fat Old Man's face, Tang Huan found it funny, \"Old Fatty, I came here to ask you a question. Where can I get a low rank gem? If you really need it, after I get it, I can make a few more and sell it to you. \"\"You're really not selling?\" Fat Old Man was stunned, and asked suspiciously.\"It's really not for sale!\"Tang Huan answered without hesitation.Only now did Fat Old Man believe him, her chubby face revealed a look of reluctance: \"Little Tang, if you want low rank gems, you can go to Gem Store to buy them.\"\"I don't have any money. How about you lend me some?\" Tang Huan said while grinning.\"That won't do. I can borrow anything, but not money.\" When Fat Old Man heard this, he immediately reflexively covered her pockets.\"That's it.\" Tang Huan curled his lips and said.\"Don't you still have 500 gold coins?\" With five hundred gold coins, you can buy a dozen or so ordinary low-grade gems. \" Fat Old Man could not help but ask.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: 24Chapter 24 - Maze Realm ForestTang Huan said helplessly: \"How can a dozen or so of them be enough, I want to possess the power of a middle Weapon Refiner as soon as possible, and I need at least a hundred low-ranked gems.\"Weapon Refiner was completely a profession that burned through money.Five hundred gold coins seemed like a lot, enough for ordinary people to live for a few years. To be able to buy gems was like a drop in the bucket.When Fat Old Man heard this, he unconsciously furrowed her brows. \"There are a large number of low-grade gems here, and the closest one is' Maze Realm Forest '.\"\"Maze Realm Forest?\"Hearing this, Tang Huan could not help but be startled.Of course he had heard of the Maze Realm Forest.The Maze Realm Forest was located on the western coast of the Origin Continent. Starting from the Glory Continent, they crossed the ocean by boat. The first place they arrived at was the Origin Continent.\"We humans are currently fighting with the Demon Clan in the Origin Continent. Isn't it very dangerous to go there?\" Suddenly, Tang Huan couldn't help but ask.\"The area where humans and the Demon Clan are fighting is deep within the Origin Continent. The distance between the Maze Realm Forest and us is extremely vast, and we are only separated by a strait, so it's relatively safe.\"The Fat Old Man laughed and said, \"In our Furious Waves City, there are a large number of Martial Disciple s going to the Maze Realm Forest every day to train, and a large number of Martial Disciple s returning from the Maze Realm Forest as well. Now that you have been promoted to Stage Two Martial Disciple, if you really want to go to Maze Realm Forest, you can go too. \"\"Alright, old fatty, you actually recognized that I'm a Stage Two Martial Disciple with a single glance. It looks like you really are a Martial Master.\"Tang Huan sized up Fat Old Man and chuckled, \"Can you reveal something? Are you Stage Four Martial Master, Stage Five Martial Master, or Stage Six Martial Master?\"\"If anyone else were to ask, I would say that I am Stage Four Martial Master. If you are, then I am Stage Five Martial Master.\"Fat Old Man smiled craftily.Hearing that, Tang Huan was startled at first, but after that he could not help but scold, \"You old fox! Looks like you are at least a Stage Six Martial Master! \"\"How could that be? No one would be able to be fooled by me, the fat grandpa is really Stage Five Martial Master.\"Fat Old Man was stunned for a moment before she quickly denied it with a wave of her hand.Tang Huan was surprised, he rolled his eyes at Fat Old Man and said: \"Old Fatty, then I will be going to Maze Realm Forest today, if you have time, help me take care of my shop. If my master comes back, inform him that I will be back soon.\"\"Right now? \"Why are you in such a hurry?\" Fat Old Man asked in surprise.\"If it's slow, then it's fast. Our Furious Waves City isn't that far from the Maze Realm Forest. It's only a day's journey anyway.\" Tang Huan said with a smile.\"The distance is not too far, but the Maze Realm Forest is so wide, and you can't go into the depths of the forest. There are so many people active in the outskirts every day, so even if you go there, you might not be able to find low-ranked gems.\" Fat Old Man could not help but advise, \"Why don't we wait a few more days? I'll help you find out the situation over at Maze Realm Forest's side, and see which areas on the forest side will make it easier to find low level gems.\"\"Old fatty, how could you get this information out?\" As for the place where the gems were produced, who wouldn't keep them hidden? They didn't want others to find out. Forget it, I'll go take a look first. If I don't try, how would I know if I really can't find the gem?Tang Huan smiled casually, wrapped the Fire Cloud Sword around his shoulder and walked out of the weapon shop in large strides, \"Don't forget what I said, I'm leaving.\"\"So fast.\"Fat Old Man went around the counter and chased out of the store. Tang Huan's figure had already disappeared, and he couldn't help but shake his head and sigh, \"I, Fatty Grandpa, am just tired of living, this kid just merged with the True Fire and was able to pass the low level Weapon Refiner assessment. She's completely a genius in refining.As soon as Tang Huan left the weapon shop of Fat Old Man, he went straight to the eastern pier of Furious Waves City.On the slightly rippling sea surface, there were all sorts of densely packed ships. On the left side of the dock were mostly passenger ships, while on the right side were cargo ships of all sizes.Tang Huan quickly boarded a passenger boat heading to Origin Continent.The boat was almost full, and soon, it entered the vast ocean. When the big ship left, Tang Huan noticed that there were two figures looking out from the pier.One of them felt somewhat familiar to Tang Huan. Just by recalling it, Tang Huan understood that it was the Tang Family.Regarding this discovery, Tang Huan wasn't surprised at all.He was very clear that since Tang Chao and Tang Hong had been beaten up to such a state, Tang Family, especially that brothers' father, Tang Tianshi, would definitely not let this matter go. Right now, they were afraid of the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" and did not dare to act rashly. However, as long as they found the opportunity, they would definitely make their move.These days, although the blacksmith shop was calm and undisturbed, Tang Huan often noticed that there were people sneaking around the blacksmith shop to spy on them.Today, the reason he left in such a hurry was because he wanted to catch the Tang Family off guard.As long as the Tang Family was one step slower, when they sent people to catch up, Tang Huan would have already entered the Maze Realm Forest, and that place would be extremely vast, and it would be extremely difficult to find him.Of course, he could still rely on his status as a low level Weapon Refiner to stay in the Furious Waves City and not go out.This way, as long as the \"Divine Weapon Pavilion\" did not fall, he would never have to worry about encountering danger. However, if a Tang Family made him so timid, he would never have much prospects in the future. As for taking revenge on Tang Family, naturally, he would forget about it.Tang Huan once again had limitless glory in his previous life, and once he arrived at Glory Continent, he definitely would not want to be mediocre like that.\"Hu!\"The passenger boat rode the wind and waves, rapidly advancing forward. Not long later, the Furious Waves City disappeared from the horizon.\"Good!\" Good! He has finally left the Furious Waves City! \"At this time, in the discussion room of the Tang Family, Tang Tianshi's excited voice sounded out, \"Big brother, I will personally set off and capture that little bastard for punishment!\" Before he finished speaking, Tang Tianshi stood up like a spring plate from his seat, and walked out with big steps.\"Second Brother, you can't!\" Seeing that, the tanned Tang Tianfeng hurriedly shouted.\"Brother, come back.\"Tang Tianren also called out to Tang Tianshi, \"You are too conspicuous, if that little scoundrel is in an accident in Origin Continent, 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' will definitely suspect our Tang Family!\"\"Then what should I do?\" Tang Tianshi asked anxiously.\"Alright, I'll do it right away.\"\"\u2026\"At the same time, in a quiet courtyard in the Tang Family, a gloomy female voice rang out: \"Since that bastard has left, things will be much easier. Uncle Lin, is your nephew reliable? If he can be relied on, then let him make a trip to Origin Continent. \"\"If that little bastard had continued to be mediocre, it would have been fine. But who would have thought that he would accidentally become the Weapon Refiner, and even have such astonishing talent, to actually use his metal Five Elements to ignite a twelve meter long totem flame.

    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: 25Chapter 25 - Demon Lord Fen TianThis was not the first time Tang Huan took a boat.In his previous life, he had ridden a giant wheel twice, so this was the third time. This ship was only twenty to thirty meters long. Its size was far from that of the giant ship from his previous life, but its speed was astonishingly fast. Tang Huan calculated that it should be at least 50 kilometers per hour.This didn't seem to be the fastest. Some ships were said to be over 100 kilometers in speed, and that meant they were flying close to the surface of the water.The reason why it was like that was because of the magic array inside the boat, it seemed to be something that was passed down from the Tian Clan's people.As long as one used a gem called 'Demon Source Stone' to activate the array, the ship would be able to move quickly. Not only that, but it could also control its speed. It was very convenient.\"Magic array, Glory Continent actually has such a thing.\"As Tang Huan recalled the pitiful amount of memories he had about the Tian Clan and the devilish array, a smile filled with praise couldn't help but surface on his face.\"Hey, hey, have you heard of this before? This time, we have won the war with the Demon Clan! \"Not long after, Tang Huan was woken up by a sound and looked over. The person who spoke was a young man who sat in the row in front of him. He was tall and strong, with a beaming look, and his words immediately attracted the attention of many Martial Warriors.There were probably more than a hundred people on this boat. They were all from Martial Warriors, and most of them were young men and women, except for a male and female who were slightly older. They looked to be around forty years old. Between the man and the woman, there seemed to be another figure lying asleep on the woman's lap, its appearance unclear.\"Are you for real?\" Didn't they say that our human armies and the Demon Clan's army are currently facing each other in the middle of Origin Continent? \" A young man in white couldn't help but ask.\"Your news was outdated a long time ago.\"The tall man laughed, and started to brag, \"Nearly a month ago, a powerful mysterious expert suddenly appeared on our side, and defeated the Demon Clan expert. We, the Human Allied Forces, seized the chance to counterattack and forced the Demon Clan army to retreat, all the way to the 'Two Realms Plain' located between the Origin Continent and himself.\"\"Ten days ago, the largest battle broke out there, and that Ranker also engaged in an extremely intense battle with the Demon Lord Fen Tian who had just arrived from the Tranquil Continent.\"\"What was the result?\" A girl in a yellow dress asked subconsciously. When the surrounding people heard this, their faces were filled with interest.\"As a result, Demon Lord Fen Tian was heavily injured and had to return to Abyss City. Demon Clan had no choice but to call a truce and temporarily suspend her invasion.\"The tall man stood up, waving his fist excitedly.\"Huh?\"Cries of surprise and gasps could be heard from the passenger ship.The Demon Lord Fen Tian of the Demon Clan was the strongest being in this world. It would be difficult to find someone that could stand shoulder to shoulder with him, especially in the Human Clan.Many years after the Human Clan fell into civil strife, the Demon Clan, which had been suppressed by the Human Clan in the past few years, seized the opportunity. Under the lead of the Demon Lord Fen Tian and the eight great Demon King s under her command, the army of the Demon Clan invaded the Origin Continent, which was occupied by the humans, in a large scale. As a result, the human army was powerless to resist, and large swathes of land were occupied. Under such circumstances, the Three Empires had even made preparations to withdraw from the Origin Continent at all costs.This being the case, many of Glory Continent s were mentally prepared for the loss of their Origin Continent s.But now, unexpectedly, there were people who said that not only did the Human Allied Forces block the Demon Clan's army and force them to retreat to a \"Two Realms Plain\", even the Demon Lord Fen Tian was severely injured.This news was simply too shocking, and the crowd found it hard to believe.Especially the news about Fen Tian, it was even more unbelievable, the strong warriors of the Three Empires, there was actually someone who could stop the terrifying Demon Lord?\"Where is that expert?\"Only after a long while did a Black Costume Brawny Man ask, her lips revealing a trace of an imperceptible taunt.The tall man shook his head regretfully: \"I don't know, but after the battle with the Demon Lord Fen Tian, that expert disappeared without a trace and never appeared again. From my guess, he should be the same as Demon Lord Fen Tian, he also received heavy injuries in that battle, and then, she was found on the ground and healed from her injuries. \"\"Then do you know where that expert came from? Which one of the Three Empires s is it? \" The Black Costume Brawny Man asked again.\"I don't know about that.\"The tall man laughed, \"Don't say that I don't know, even the Three Empires warriors over at the 'Two Realms Plain' probably don't know. Otherwise, why would they say that they are mysterious experts?\"\"Tch, why don't you continue making it up?\"The Black Costume Brawny Man disdainfully snorted, wearing a \"I knew it would be like this\" expression. The shock in the hearts of the surrounding people gradually subsided, and they could not help but suspect.\"How can this be made up?\"The muscular man stared at him and shouted anxiously, \"My uncle is General Qiu Ji of Great Tang Empire, he personally participated in the great battle of Two Realms Plain and was sent back to deliver the news. He passed Furious Waves City yesterday, and he told me all of this. He saw it with his own eyes, how could it be fake? \"\"Heh heh.\"However, he was met with a burst of ridiculing laughter.It was one thing for the tall man to not say this, but one could not believe it. A general of the Great Tang Empire who had participated in the great battle of the \"Two Realms Plain\" actually didn't know who the expert who had helped the human army force to retreat from the Demon Clan was.\"Hey hey, what I said was true!\"The tall man shouted excitedly.Unfortunately, at this time, no one could believe what had just happened. The tall man screamed a few times, then sat down with a huff. His expression was full of anger.\"Could what this fellow said be true?\"Tang Huan did not believe him in the beginning, since the hole in his words was too big. But looking at his expression, Tang Huan started to suspect him.It was very possible that his uncle did not tell him the truth, for example, the strong man did not want to reveal his identity, so he made the generals of the Three Empires keep it a secret for him, or the strong warrior did not reveal his true face at all. It was possible that the strong warrior used his powerful strength to intimidate the general of the Three Empires, and then worked together with the Human Allied Forces, forcing the Demon Clan army to retreat to the \"Two Realms Plain.\"There were both possibilities!In the next moment, Tang Huan smilingly patted the tall man's shoulder.After being patted like this by Tang Huan, he immediately turned his head around with his eyes wide open, as if he wanted to flare up. However, Tang Huan's next sentence, caused the anger on his face to dissipate like smoke in thin air, and his face flushed red from excitement: \"Do you really believe what I said just now?\"\"Of course!\"Tang Huan laughed and nodded.\"Let me tell you, I really did not lie. Whether what I said was true or not, we will know when we arrive at Origin Continent.\" The muscular man beamed as he looked at Tang Huan as if he was looking at his best friend, \"Brother, what's your name? My name is Qiu Jian, I'm from Furious Waves City.\"\"Tang Huan.\" Tang Huan smiled again.\"Tang Family?\" Hearing that, Qiu Jian frowned.\"No, I don't have any relationship with Tang Family, I just happen to be surnamed Tang.\" Tang Huan shook his head.\"It's good as long as it's not Tang Family. Among all Furious Waves City, the one I hate the most is that Tang Family.\" Qiu Jian's brows instantly relaxed.\"\u2026\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: 26Chapter 26 - Divine Weapon CatalogueAt noon, the guest ship docked at an island.Qiu Jian was extremely talkative, before the passenger ship left, he switched seats with another person, and sat beside Tang Huan.Most of the time, it was Tang Huan who listened, and Qiu Jian who spoke.Tang Huan realized that this new friend of his had seen and heard a lot, many things that he had never heard of, but Qiu Jian knew his place well.From his mouth, Tang Huan had gained quite a bit of knowledge.Unknowingly, more and more boats passed by, the surface of the sea was extremely busy, it was obvious that they were almost at Origin Continent.\"Brother Tang Huan, what are you doing in Origin Continent this time?\" Qiu Jian looked up and could not help but ask.\"I plan to train and gain experience at the edge of Maze Realm Forest.\"Tang Huan laughed, \"Brother Qiu Jian, what about you?\"Qiu Jian chuckled: \"I want to go to the 'Two Realms Plain' to join its army. According to my uncle, although there is a truce over there, there are still frequent conflicts over there. If we go there, we don't have to worry about not having an opponent.\"Then I will first wish Big Brother success in advancing to Stage Four Martial Master.\"Tang Huan said with a smile. This Brother Qiu Jian's talent was also not bad, at the age of eighteen, he had opened up nine meridians, and became a Stage Three Martial Disciple. Now that he was twenty, even though his foundation was extremely stable, he was still unable to break through.\"It will definitely succeed.\"Qiu Jian laughed heartily, \"After I break through, I'll go back to the Furious Waves City to look for you. At that time, you'd better not be still in the Stage Two Martial Disciple!\"\"At that time, I will definitely be a Stage Three Martial Disciple. Maybe if I accidentally become a Stage Four Martial Master, I will catch up to you.\" Ignoring the looks of despise from the surroundings, Tang Huan boasted and laughed shamelessly.\"Catch up to me? \"None at all!\"Qiu Jian rolled his eyes, and said mysteriously while bragging, \"Let me tell you the truth, that when I go to Two Realms Plain this time, I still want to try and see if I can find that mysterious Ranker. If I find him, then I will be rich, and at that time, when I become his disciple, he will just casually point and say whatever he wants, and I might even be a Stage Five Martial Master. \"Tang Huan was speechless, how could he find that person so easily? Even if he found the person, he might not even be willing to accept him as a disciple.\"Brother Qiu Jian, since that expert is able to injure Demon Lord Fen Tian, his strength must be extremely tyrannical. Do you know what cultivation realm he is in? Stage Nine Martial Saint? \" In that moment, Tang Huan could not help but ask curiously. The seventh stage was the Great Martial Master, the eighth stage was the Martial Lord and the Stage Nine was the Martial Saint.\"I do not know whether he is Stage Nine Martial Saint or not, but I heard my uncle say that he has a Divine Weapon! For him to be able to defeat the Demon Lord Fen Tian, that Divine Weapon 'Wanyu' must have played a huge role. \" Qiu Jian lowered his voice to a whisper, it was as soft as a mosquito's buzz.\"Wanyu? Divine Weapon? \"Tang Huan's heart skipped a beat, he immediately associated it with a high level weapon. A middle level weapon, high level weapon, high level weapon, after the high level weapon was the Heaven Stage weapon, Saint Ranked weapon, and even the legendary Divine Weapon.\"That's a Divine Weapon forged from a 'Divine Weapon Catalogue'!\" Qiu Jian's eyes were filled with envy.\"Divine Weapon Catalogue?\"Tang Huan's mind was in turmoil again, but just as he was about to ask more clearly, he felt the boat suddenly stop, and its body leaning forward, following that, a loud voice came from the bow of the ship, \"Everyone, Origin Continent's' Crescent City 'has arrived, it's time to disembark! \"Time to disembark.\"It was the owner of the boat shouting!Tang Huan looked over in a blink of an eye, only to realize that the passenger ship had stopped at the pier. The passengers on their seats all picked up their luggage and stood up.\"Let's go down as well.\"Qiu Jian also stood up.Tang Huan could only restrain himself from asking the Divine Weapon Catalogue s, and also stood up.\"Brother Tang Huan, I shall take my leave now.\" Qiu Jian jumped onto the wharf, raised his hand and patted Tang Huan's shoulder heavily.\"Big brother, be careful.\" Tang Huan also laughed.\"I don't need to worry, my uncle will return to the 'Two Realms Plain' very soon. With him there, nothing will happen to me, but you need to be extra careful while training in the Maze Realm Forest. Don't try to be brave.\" Qiu Jian reminded Yun Che repeatedly. He had only known Tang Huan for less than a day and he had already treated him as a true friend.\"Understood, I will be careful.\"\"\u2026\"Watching Qiu Jian leave with big strides, Tang Huan couldn't help but sigh. However, after a short while, he collected his thoughts and quickly walked towards the city.The Crescent City was located in a rather special place.The city was built on the shore, so they were called Crescent City, and almost all of the people that lived in the city were Martial Warriors. Although the Crescent City was not very big, it had a large population and many shops. It was very bustling.To avoid leaving any more traces, Tang Huan did not stay in the city any longer. He only bought some rations and other necessities and left the city on his own.To the north of the Crescent City was the direction of the Phoenix Mountain, and to the south, it was an unusually vast area.It was said that the entire forest had a circumference of nearly ten thousand miles.In the forest near the Crescent City, there was a huge road that was a hundred meters wide. On the road, many Martial Warriors s rushed towards the city, some of them were carrying huge bags, looking extremely excited, while some of them were being supported by their companions, clearly injured in the forest.It was already dusk, so there were not many people like Tang Huan who headed towards Maze Realm Forest.The deeper he went, the narrower the road became. Tang Huan followed the road and only walked a few kilometers. When the sky had almost completely darkened, he dove into the dense forest.Almost at the same time, a guest boat was seen leaning against the brightly lit pier of the Crescent City.Five young men came out of the dock and started searching for something at the shops on the side of the road, and then entered the Crescent City.\"Five idiots!\"Just as their figures disappeared, another young man with a longsword on his waist slowly walked over from the direction of the dock. He looked at the city gate and sneered. This man had a slender body and a handsome face. However, his lips were extremely thin. His overly white skin made him seem a bit feminine.\"You want to find someone just by scaring the grass and alerting the snake like that?\"The effeminate man curled his lips in ridicule, and after entering Crescent City, he did not linger, and directly left the city for the south, his figure immediately blending into the darkness.After a while, on another passenger boat that had just stopped, a plump and fat old man practically slipped off without touching the ground \u2026 \u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: 27Chapter 27 - Worldquake\"What, the Demon Clan has left? Even Demon Lord Fen Tian was heavily injured? \"Furious Waves City, third level of Divine Weapon Pavilion. Qing Ye looked at the piece of paper in her hand, and a wisp of unconcealable shock surfaced on that charming and gorgeous face.The Demon Lord was a super strong Ranker that was comparable to the top of the Stage Nine Martial Saint.The names of the Stage Nine Martial Saint s appeared in Qing Ye's mind, and one by one, she eliminated the names. Those Human Clan s, if they worked together, would be able to fight with Fen Tian, but if they fought one-on-one, perhaps no one would be able to match him, let alone heavily injure him!In this world, perhaps only the Tian Clan's Shakyamuni would be able to fight against Fen Tian!Could this be false news?Qing Ye subconsciously thought about it, but then she shook her head. It was impossible for this news to be false, among the Human Allied Forces, a general of the Great Tang Empire called Qiu Ji had already returned to the capital to report about her duty, and had just passed by the Furious Waves City yesterday.If it was just ordinary news, there was no need for the general to personally step in.\"I really didn't expect this.\"A soft sigh resounded, it was actually Mu Kui's short and skinny figure that suddenly appeared in front of Qing Ye, \"There's actually such a strong Ranker hiding in our Human Clan?\"\"Senior Mu Kui, you got the news too?\" Qing Ye could not help but ask.\"That's right, and I also know that the weapon used by that expert is a Divine Weapon!\"Mu Kui said slowly. When the last two words came out of his mouth, his deep eyes were filled with deep shock \u2026\"Divine Weapon?\"Qing Ye's expression changed greatly, \"Which Divine Weapon?\"\"Wanyu?\" Mu Kui said faintly.\"The ninth ranked Divine Weapon, 'Wanyu Sword'?\" Qing Ye gasped.\"That's right!\" Mu Kui nodded his head, his face was filled with surprise.\"Someone actually forged this Divine Weapon?\"Qing Ye's face was in a daze as she muttered to herself. After being submerged in shock for a good while, she anxiously asked. \"Senior Mu Kui, do you know who that person is?\"\"I don't know yet, but even the commanders and generals of Human Allied Forces don't know. It's said that he always wore a mask.\"Mu Kui shook his head.Qing Ye took a light breath and muttered to herself, \"The one who forged the Divine Weapon was undoubtedly the Weapon Refining Grand Master! As long as we investigate the Weapon Refining Grand Master s that have existed for the past hundred years and then remove them one by one, we might be able to find out his identity. \"\"I'm afraid he might not be able to find out.\"\"I have to try to know, Senior Mu Kui. I will send the news back to the Heavenly Forging City right now.\"\"\u2026\"The capital of the Great Tang Empire, Fallen God City.\"Good!\" \"Alright!\"The one who spoke was a middle-aged man dressed in a golden dragon robe. He had a tall and sturdy build, his face was mighty, and his facial features were sharp and sharp, as though he was cutting through steel, sitting upright on a wide imperial chair. He looked extremely imposing.This middle-aged man was the emperor of the Great Tang Empire, Tang Lie.\"In this war, although our Tang Empire's army suffered heavy losses, it was completely worth it. After this war, at least ten years, us humans and the Demon Clan will not have a war.\" Tang Lie laughed out loud, his palm heavily hitting the imperial chair's armrest a few times, his eyebrows filled with unconcealable excitement.\"Your Majesty is right.\"A few meters in front of Tang Lie, a black-clothed man who looked to be in his thirties and had a pretty good appearance replied with a smile, \"Demon Lord Fen Tian is heavily injured, the Demon Clan's army has been defeated, and it's impossible for them to invade again in a short period of time. However, there are handicapped veterans everywhere in Origin Continent, and it's not possible to exterminate them in a short period of time.\"\"It's just some defeated generals of the Demon Clan. It's fine, it's fine, even if they were allowed to stay in the Origin Continent, it wouldn't be a big deal. Someone, spread the news that our allied Army had achieved a great victory, that our Demon Lord had been heavily injured, and that our Demon Clan had been defeated and retreated. \" Tang Lie's voice was like thunder, his loud and clear voice surged within the palace.\"Yes sir!\"Outside palace, someone immediately replied and left.It was only after laughing heartily for a while that Tang Lie's expression finally calmed down a little: \"Qiu Ji, tell us, who exactly is that expert, to actually be able to injure Fen Tian so severely, is he a citizen of our Tang Empire, or from the Mo Yun or two nations?\"\"Your Majesty, no one in the allied army knows his identity now.\" The black clothed man called Qiu Ji forced a smile.\"Oh? \"Why is that?\" Tang Lie was startled.\"That Ranker had always been wearing a mask, and even when he met Tang Zhao, he had always been this way. However, judging from his voice and body, he was not young, and was not very tall either.As he said till here, Qiu Ji's voice paused, and then continued, \"He still has the Divine Weapon, which is why when he fought with Fen Tian, he was not at a disadvantage at all, and even heavily injured Fen Tian. Unfortunately, after that battle, the expert had already disappeared.\"\"The Divine Weapon's' Wanyu '?\"Tang Lie's expression changed greatly as he stood up from the imperial chair. Even his breathing became hurried.Divine Weapon is the most powerful weapon in the world.In the current Great Tang Empire Royal Family, there was a handful of Divine Weapon, and it was in the hands of the founder of the Tang Empire.\"Exactly.\" Qiu Ji nodded his head heavily, then added on, \"This is the judgment of the commander, Tang Zhao, so it should not be wrong.\"\"Since it's as Wang says, then it can't be wrong.\"Tang Lie sat back down on his seat, his expression much calmer than before, \"Qiu Ji, you should rest for a while inside the God-down City, then return to guard the 'Two Realms Plain'. The reward for the army of our Tang Empire, will also be brought by you to the 'Two Realms Plain'.\"Thank you, your majesty!\"After Qiu Ji expressed his gratitude, he bowed and left.Once her figure had disappeared, Tang Lie then called out in a low voice, \"XunQiu has come to meet us!\"\"Yes sir!\"In the shadows behind the imperial chair, a figure disappeared quickly.Tang Lie squinted his eyes, he was silent for a moment before he snorted: \"The ninth ranked Wanyu Sword? I would like to see just who your master is! \"Almost at the same time, a voice also sounded in the palace of Mo Yun Empire's capital: \"Investigate! Check carefully for me! We must find out that person's identity! \"\"That Divine Weapon 'Wanyu' must have been recently forged. Could it be that that person is an old man from the Heavenly Forging City?\"In the Sha Long Empire city, in a courtyard deep within the palace, an old man who looked like he had just stepped into a coffin murmured softly.When all the major powers were doing their best to investigate the identity and whereabouts of the mysterious Ranker, the news of the human army from the three Kingdoms joining forces and the Demon Clan's army spread crazily throughout the Glory Continent. In just a few days, it had spread to almost every corner of the Glory Continent.For a time, the entire world shook as countless people cheered for it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: 28Chapter 28 - Spiritual Beast\"Awoooo \u2014\"In Maze Realm Forest, the loud and clear howls of wolves suddenly broke the tranquility of the early morning. Within the short shrubs, dozens of sturdy Black Wolf s were sprinting forward, as fast as lightning.A few dozen meters in front of the pack of wolves, a figure was running frantically. It was Tang Huan.\"Damn it, after entering the Maze Realm Forest for more than ten days, it's fine if I can't find a single low-ranked gem, but I would be chased by these beasts even if I wanted to sleep!\"Tang Huan was depressed in his heart, but he did not dare stop in his tracks.In his previous life, he had also seen wolves at the zoo, but those wolves were only as big as dogs. However, all the wolves in Maze Realm Forest were actually close to one metre tall, especially that guy who looked like a wolf. He was even stronger than Pang Shuo, and was as strong as a horse.Just yesterday, Tang Huan saw a fellow who looked like a Stage Two Martial Disciple being torn apart by a few Great Black Wolf s behind him.Right now, there were dozens of Black Wolf chasing them. If they were surrounded, the result would be very miserable.During the past ten or so days since he had entered the Maze Realm Forest, Tang Huan had been extremely vigilant at night, constantly paying attention to his surroundings. After continuously being here for so many days, he was already a little tired to the point of being unable to endure any longer, and also did not encounter any sort of danger during the previous few nights.However, he didn't expect that the wolf pack would find him at dawn.By the time Tang Huan woke up, the wolf pack was already more than a hundred meters away. Tang Huan didn't even have time to pack up his tents, rations and the like.Last night, Tang Huan intentionally chose an empty place to sleep, so that he would be able to discover danger.In such an area, the wolves were almost unstoppable.Even if Tang Huan channeled his Genuine Qi and ran frantically, he could not compare to the four legged Black Wolf.Fortunately, there was a forest not far ahead.One hundred meters, fifty meters, thirty meters, ten meters \u2026\"Whoosh!\"Tang Huan fled into the lush forest like an arrow that had left the bow.His eyes quickly swept across the area, and after a moment, Tang Huan selected a large tree that was around 20-30 metres tall, and shot upwards like an ape. He reached a tree branch that was about 10 metres above the ground in a few steps, and felt that it was still not safe, thus Tang Huan climbed another few metres.Immediately after, dozens of Black Wolf rushed into the forest and surrounded the big tree.\"Awoo!\" The sturdy head wolf howled and a few Black Wolf s took a few steps forward and started chewing on the tree trunk crazily.\"An animal is an animal. Do you think that's the case?\"Seeing that, Tang Huan could not help but laugh out loud, but before he finished speaking, his laughter suddenly stopped, and his eyes revealed shock that was difficult to hide. The speed at which the Black Wolf were chewing on the tree trunk was astonishing. The tree pieces flew around their mouth, and in a short while, a circle of the tree trunk was bitten off.If this trend continued, this tree, which took almost two people to hold together, would probably be bitten off in less than a minute.\"Awoo!\"Pang Shuo's head wolf let out another heaven-shaking roar, raising its head to look up, its pair of ghastly green eyes seemed to ridicule him.Listening to the cracking sounds coming from below, Tang Huan felt his scalp go numb.\"You are all vicious. I do not believe that you can eat all the trees in this forest!\"Tang Huan grinded his teeth and cursed, in a moment, he swept his gaze across the area, and then quickly ran along the thick branches, after a while, he jumped up high and landed on another big tree more than 10 metres away, but at the same time, the wolves closed in from below once again.Kacha, kacha.The Black Wolf who was chewing on the tree trunk changed a few of them, but that kind of voice that made people sour once again sounded out, after staying for just a little while, Tang Huan had no choice but to change his position.After about half an hour of continuous circulation, the tree he was standing on had already been replaced by a few dozen.The wolves below were completely on his tail, and they followed him wherever he went, then began to nibble at the tree trunks. Under this kind of situation, Tang Huan didn't dare to get down from the ground.Tang Huan was caught between a rock and a hard place, if he had known this earlier, he would not have climbed up the tree. If he had continued to run in the forest, with the help of the trees, he might have been able to change the situation.However, at this point, it was too late for regret.\"We can't continue like this.\"Tang Huan thought quickly, \"This pack of wolves is too troublesome. If they stay under the tree for more than ten days and don't leave, even if I am not eaten by them, I would starve to death in the end. Moreover, after dying of starvation, I would still become the food of those beasts below.\"After thinking about it, Tang Huan moved his big tree that he settled down on again.\"Awoo!\"The wolf pack followed him again, but halfway through, the head wolf suddenly howled.The wolf pack immediately turned around and charged towards another lush tree. In a split-second, the tree was surrounded.\"Hmm?\"Tang Huan was surprised, but he did not act rashly. In his mind, it was very likely that the wolves were tired of chasing after them, and the reason they had made such a move was to lure him down from the tree, and now, there were probably Black Wolf lying in ambush around.In the next moment, Tang Huan immediately counted, only to realize that the number of Black Wolf around the big tree did not decrease at all.All of the Black Wolf s that were chasing him were there!\"Awoo!\"Just as Tang Huan was confused, the head wolf suddenly growled. It took two steps forward and used its claws to smack the slightly concave piece of tree bark onto the ground.In a flash, a hole the size of a washbasin appeared.\"Yiya!\"Inside the hole, a blue beast the size of a soccer ball was curled up into a ball, trembling in fear. Even from where Tang Huan was standing, one could see the tears glistened in its black eyes, it looked pitiful.\"Awoo!\" In the next moment, almost all of the Black Wolf s opened their mouths and roared, and their voices revealed unconcealable excitement.\"Yiya!\" \"Yiya!\"The small blue beast desperately squeezed its way inside, its mouth producing a childish cry. The tears in its large eyes could no longer be concealed as they fell down in long streams.Tang Huan was not a compassionate person, but when he saw its pitiful appearance, he couldn't help but feel pity for it in the bottom of his heart.\"This little thing can't be a Spiritual Beast, right? Otherwise, why would he have such a human-like expression? \"Tang Huan could not help but mutter. In this world, Spiritual Beast were an extremely rare beast life form, they could absorb spirit energy like humans, and they were extremely intelligent. Maybe their strength was not strong enough, but they would usually possess some extremely miraculous and unbelievable ability.The pitiful state of the little blue beast made the wolf pack even more excited. They couldn't help but approach the hole with eyes full of greed.\"Awoo!\"When the head wolf saw this, it bared its fangs and let out an angry roar. The surrounding wolves immediately became clear-headed, and no one dared to challenge its authority. It hurriedly retreated with its tail between its legs.\"Yiya, yiya.\"Just then, the blue beast seemed to have sensed Tang Huan's existence, and looked at him through the hole, its round and bright eyes full of pleading.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: 29Chapter 29 - FightingThose eyes \u2026Tang Huan's heart trembled, he could not help but see the scene in front of him. On the deathly pale hospital bed, a girl who was on the verge of death with leukemia was looking at him in despair.That girl was his younger sister from his previous life. She was extremely adorable, but she died before she was six years old.His parents had passed away early in his previous life, and this was not unrelated to it.Tang Huan was very clear that if he did nothing, the little thing inside the hole in the tree would definitely be eaten by Pang Shuo's head wolf that was below him.If he turned around and left now, he would have a high chance of escaping. To a pack of wolves, his value should be far inferior to that small Spiritual Beast.He had a faint feeling that the wolf was extremely intelligent. The reason why it didn't pounce on and eat the small blue beast the moment it discovered it was probably because it wanted to see if he could help. If he really couldn't bear it any longer, then the wolf could kill two birds with one stone.At that moment, Tang Huan really wanted to turn his head and pretend he did not see it, but the look in the little blue beast's eyes made his heart tighten.If he really didn't see it, then he would never feel at ease for the rest of his life. The despair in his eyes was too similar to that of a little sister who died prematurely. It was so painful that it made one's heart ache.In the blink of an eye, countless of thoughts flashed across Tang Huan's mind.\"Damn it, let's go all out!\"An instant later, Tang Huan suddenly gritted his teeth and said, \"I was the one who brought this disaster to you. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been surrounded by the wolves!\"\"Clang!\"In the next moment, Tang Huan untied the Fire Cloud Sword from his back and activated Genuine Qi. Using his sword to slash downwards, he sliced off a branch that was as thick as a bowl from the top of his head. He then raised it and threw it fiercely towards the wolf pack that was over ten meters away.At the same time, Tang Huan followed behind the tree branch and leaped forward with all his might.\"Hu!\" Dozens of Black Wolf s scattered in all directions, a large bundle of branches smashed onto the ground, and Tang Huan also landed in the middle of the branches.\"Come out!\" Tang Huan shouted towards the hole.\"Yiya!\"The blue beast seemed to understand, it cheered excitedly and came out of the tree hole like a wisp of smoke. It then jumped up and used its claws to grab onto Tang Huan's clothes, and in a few steps climbed onto's shoulder, and then firmly grabbed onto his collar.\"Awoo!\"At almost the same time, the head wolf roared and following that, two Black Wolf s jumped out from the big tree and rushed towards Tang Huan's back. Not only that, in front of him and to the left and right of Tang Huan, there were also two Black Wolf s who had opened their bloody mouths to flank him.\"Hold on tight!\" With the situation so critical, Tang Huan no longer cared to observe what the small blue beast looked like. With a low roar, the Fire Cloud Sword in his palm swept backwards in a strange trajectory, and used the fifth form of \"Wandering Dragon Tail\" from the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\".\"Buzz!\"The moment the sword was unleashed, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" inside the Dantian began to revolve rapidly, and the Genuine Qi that contained the Power of True Fire began to flow into the sword body in an unending flow. In the midst of the intense trembling, the wide sword body immediately released a brilliant red light, and the incomparably hot aura filled the air with insanity.Wherever the long sword passed, it immediately stirred up an incomparably blazing wave of heat.The reactions of the two Black Wolf s behind were extremely sharp, and practically the instant they felt the heat wave, they had already started dodging. But even so, the right Black Wolf was still a step too slow, his neck was slashed by the Fire Cloud Sword's sword, and before she could even make a sound, she fell to the ground. Fresh blood flowed out from the several inch deep wound on his neck, the wound was already charred, and the hair on the side of her body had been burnt even more so that it emitted a scorching stench.\"Awoo!\"The Black Wolf on the left escaped death, and the sharp and scorching sword edge only made a scratch on its front leg, but the condition of the wound was exactly the same as its companion. It rolled on the ground and screamed continuously in pain.\"Chi!\"Tang Huan didn't have time to check on the results of the battle. With a turn of the Fire Cloud Sword in his hand, \"Wandering Dragon Tail\" turned into \"Wandering Dragon in Water\", and the tip of the sword trembled as it shot out ripples towards the Black Wolf that was rushing over from the right at lightning speed.The Black Wolf seemed to be unable to figure out the trajectory of Tang Huan's Fire Cloud Sword, and after being stunned for a bit, the blazing sword's body entered its mouth.\"Aooo!\"Before the roar could completely burst out of its throat, Tang Huan slightly twisted his wrist, causing the Fire Cloud Sword to spin very quickly.The sizzling sound continued without end, like a red-hot iron imprinting itself onto pork, Black Wolf was in so much pain that his entire body was trembling. However, before it could retreat, Tang Huan had already raised his right arm, lifting Black Wolf's heavy body up as he ruthlessly smashed towards the two Black Wolf s who were rushing over.\"Yiya!\"Right at this moment, a tender and anxious clear voice suddenly sounded in his ears.Immediately after, a strong fishy wind swept over from the left, Tang Huan did not hesitate at all as he rushed forward to the right, the Fire Cloud Sword in his hands slashed behind him, and then used \"Tail of a Wandering Dragon\", and in the next moment, Tang Huan felt as if the blade of his sword had slashed across his muscles and bones.\"Slash!\"It was also at this time that the sound of silk ripping rang out, and following that, Tang Huan's arm experienced an excruciating pain similar to that of being torn apart.Not far behind him, the Black Wolf was lying on the ground and twitching. Half of its neck had already been cut off and it was still biting Tang Huan's sleeve and flesh in its mouth.\"Even if you die, you still want to bite me!\"Tang Huan cursed, endured the pain on his arm, swung his Fire Cloud Sword, and pounced towards the head of the wolf that was about twenty meters away.He knew in his heart that only after he took care of this head wolf, would the other Black Wolf be able to retreat, otherwise, he would have to continuously deal with the berserk attacks of the wolves. Even if she could kill all these smaller ones, he would still have to face the even more powerful head wolf.By that time, he would probably be exhausted. Perhaps he and that little thing would both be easily eaten by it.\"Awoo!\"However, that wolf obviously did not plan to let Tang Huan get so close to it. Its eyes flickered with a cold and cruel light and its mouth issued a heaven-shaking roar.In an instant, as if the surrounding Black Wolf were listening to an imperial decree, they once again madly pounced over from all directions.This time, there were not six Black Wolf s that rushed over at the same time, but twelve.Tang Huan's eyes were fierce and his expression was sinister. His footsteps was slow as he continued to rush towards the wolf.If he didn't want to die, he could only move forward!If he fought with the head wolf as fast as he could, he would have a high chance of surviving. However, if he died or was killed by it, then that would be the end of it!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: 30Chapter 30 - Killed Head Wolf!\"Kill \u2014\"\"Awoo!\"\"\u2026\"In the forest, angry roars, wolf howls, and violent clashing sounds rose and fell one after another, echoing through the skies. Tang Huan and the direwolves were frantically killing each other.Spreading Wandering Dragon, Wandering Dragon in Ripple, Wandering Dragon in Sea.Once the \"Nine Moves of Wandering Dragon\" was used, this low level battle skill was displayed extremely well by Tang Huan, and there were still Black Wolf that fell to the ground beside Tang Huan.However, compared to the casualties in Black Wolf, the wounds on Tang Huan's body were growing.At this time, he used a method of exchange for his life using injuries. As long as the Fire Cloud Sword could kill one or two Black Wolf s, he did not care about being bitten a little.Not long after, Tang Huan's clothes were tattered and his body was covered with wounds. His entire body was dyed red with blood.Some of this blood came from the wounds on his body, but there were also some that were sprayed out by the Black Wolf.\"Slash!\"The sound of clothes ripping rang out once again.Tang Huan was like an injured beast, as he released a hoarse roar from his mouth. However, his movements were not affected in the slightest, and as his body slightly bent, the Fire Cloud Sword in his hands was instantly thrown out like lightning.\"Chi!\"In a split-second, the sharp blade edge landed on the body of Black Wolf, who had been leaping up in the air, bringing along a fierce heat wave. It actually cleaved him apart from the start to the end, and without even pausing for a moment, it whistled across the sky as fresh blood rained down, and splashed onto Tang Huan's head.\"Bang!\" \"Bam!\"Two pieces of a wolf's body heavily smashed onto the Black Wolf who was biting Tang Huan's thigh. His innards scattered all over the ground and the Black Wolf jumped up in shock as fear filled her eyes.\"Bastards! Even if I die, I will drag you all down with me!\"\"Kill \u2014\"Tang Huan's entire body was drenched in blood, his expression sinister. He looked like a god of death that had just charged out from the depths of hell, his body permeated with a thick smell of killing intent and blood.Up till now, more than half of the Black Wolf s had died to Tang Huan's sword.Although the surrounding Black Wolf were moving forward, Tang Huan's unafraid of death had long ago caused them to fear him. It was only because he was under the attack of the leader wolf's obscene might that they continued to attack. However, the miserable death of the Black Wolf immediately caused the rest of the Black Wolf to slow down, as their eyes wandered.Seeing Tang Huan rushing over, the few Black Wolf s bent down with their front legs, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, as though they wanted to jump into the air, but still kept on retreating. Tang Huan laughed sinisterly, his sword striking out like a dragon, once again bringing up a heat wave that seemed to be able to ignite the air, sweeping towards the two Black Wolf s who were blocking the front.\"Woo woo \u2026\"The two Black Wolf s could no longer withstand the threat of death and suddenly scurried to the side. Once they fled, the other Black Wolf s also escaped one after another.\"Awoo!\"The head wolf roared angrily, Pang Shuo's body dashed forward fiercely and rushed to the side of the Black Wolf that was closest to it. Lowering his head, he actually bit off the Black Wolf's neck in one bite, and when the other twenty to thirty Black Wolf saw this, they all became terrified.\"Bastard, it's your turn!\"Without waiting for the head wolves to urge the Black Wolf on him again, Tang Huan roared loudly and pounced towards the wolf like a bloody tornado.The wolf's eyes were filled with ice-cold, bloodthirsty killing intent as it suddenly raised one of its front claws and ruthlessly lashed out.\"Bam!\"With a flick of a finger, the wolf claw landed on the sword body, Tang Huan felt a burst of huge force, causing the Fire Cloud Sword to swing out, following that, its palm became numb, and the broadsword almost slipped out of his hands. Tang Huan held onto the sword hilt tightly. Only after being pulled a few steps back by the Fire Cloud Sword did he manage to stabilize his body.Such great strength!Tang Huan was startled, he glanced over, only to see that the wolf's front paw had started to tiptoe, and a familiar burnt stench was coming towards him, he could not help but laugh out loud: \"An animal is an animal, so many of my underlings have died, or do you not remember, is this sword of mine really that easy to touch?\"\"Awoo!\"The wolf was completely enraged, Pang Shuo flew up into the sky, opened his mouth wide and pounced towards Tang Huan, immediately releasing a strong fishy wind.Seeing that, Tang Huan also bellowed, the Fire Cloud Sword streaked across with a red light and directly slashed towards the head of the wolf.This Head Wolf was not the Black Wolf that had just used a low level battle skill. It might not be as effective as using the simplest and most crude method.Seeing that, the head wolf turned its head, its left front paw suddenly swept out, looking at Tang Huan with a look of disdain.\"Bam!\"Almost at the same time, the head wolf's other front paw pierced into Tang Huan's chest.At this moment, Tang Huan's chest also suffered a heavy blow, the blood Qi in his body churned, and his body flew tens of meters away like he was riding on clouds. The moment he landed, he spat out a mouthful of blood, and Tang Huan also tilted his head, closing his eyes, as if he had fainted.\"Yiya!\" \"Yiya!\"The meaty little blue beast crawled out from under Tang Huan's neck and ran towards the big tree a few metres away like a wisp of smoke. However, once it reached the big tree, it stopped and quickly returned to Tang Huan's side, screaming anxiously in his ear.After a while, Tang Huan did not wake up. The wolf instead walked over slowly with its mouth slightly open.The small blue beast shrunk its body and trembled as tears fell from its eyes.The head wolf looked at the blue beast with its cold and fierce eyes, then looked at Tang Huan, as if trying to decide which to eat first. Very quickly, it lowered its head and bit towards Tang Huan's neck.The moment those exceptionally sharp fangs were about to be inserted into its muscles, Tang Huan suddenly opened his eyes without any warning. He turned his head to the side, and with a hug on the huge wolf's neck, he immediately jumped up, and landed on the back of the head wolf. Both of his legs grabbed onto its abdomen, and before even a blink of an eye, Tang Huan's palms, that were pressed tightly against the head wolf's neck, had already ignited into raging flames.Immediately afterwards, the violent flames spread out, covering the entire head of the wolf.\"Zizi!\" The sound of hair, skin, and flesh being burnt was heard, followed by a burnt smell.\"Awoo!\"\"Plop!\"The moment he landed, Tang Huan spat out another mouthful of blood, but his hands and legs did not relax in the slightest.That wolf, under the constant burning of the True Fire, became incomparably berserk, fleeing in all directions while screaming miserably. Not long after, it started to roll on the ground in pain, but as time went by, its movements were getting smaller and smaller.Not long after, Pang Shuo's head wolf completely stopped moving.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: 31The twenty to thirty remaining Black Wolf s were all scared silly by this sudden turn of events and stood in their original places in a daze.\"Which beast wants to die?\"Tang Huan pushed the head wolf's corpse away and leaped up, his eyes that were as red as blood scanning the area, waving both of his crazy arms, he roared out ferociously, filled with killing intent.\"Wuu wuu\", all the Black Wolf were startled awake, they quickly turned their heads and fled in panic. In that moment, they had disappeared from Tang Huan's sight.\"We finally survived!\"Tang Huan calmed down from his excitement and heaved a sigh of relief.Instantly, an indescribable tiredness and pain surged forth from every part of his body. With a jolt of his body, he sat on the ground on his bottom.Before this, Tang Huan did not completely use the \"True Fire\" because he wanted to leave it to deal with that head wolf.The final sneak attack worked.However, the berserk move that the head wolf followed up on made his injuries even more severe. After using \"True Fire\" to burn the head wolf to death, Tang Huan himself was already spent. However, he knew that he had to hold on. If the Black Wolf s saw what had happened, he and the little guy would definitely die.Now that the wolves had retreated, Tang Huan could no longer hold on.\"Little thing, are you still alive?\" Tang Huan felt pain all over his body, and he struggled to turn his neck.A crisp chirp entered his ears.Immediately after, a ball of blue meat the size of a palm jumped onto Tang Huan's shoulder, and rolled down his arm onto his open palm, spreading outwards.Only now did Tang Huan have the mind to carefully size up this small blue beast that he had brought down yet again.The shape of this fellow was rather strange. Its small body was supported by a large head, and its slightly protruding mouth revealed two small white fangs. On top of its mouth was a short golden horn. The appearance of the sharp horn was quite similar to the rhinoceros horn that Tang Huan had seen in his previous life.On its head, there was not only a pair of ears that were excessively large, but also two eyes that were excessively large.A golden color similar to the horn appeared in his ears, but his blue eyes were bright and clear, making him look like two serene springs. It was as if tiny ripples of water were rippling through the depths of his pupils, making him look very lovable.His head was lowered to his chubby body.On his body, his forelimbs were short and thick, while his hind legs were fat and strong. The four claws on his flesh were also golden. Behind the little guy's buttocks, there was a short tail. What was surprising was that it even had a pair of fleshy wings on its back.The lower part of his two wings and his abdomen were all grayish-white, while the rest of his body was a sapphire blue color. His body even faintly revealed a sparkling luster.What made Tang Huan even more surprised was that after battling with the pack of wolves for such a long time, his face had already been covered with dirt and blood, but this fellow was still clean and clean. Forget about being drenched in blood, he couldn't even see a single speck of dust on him.When he first saw it in the hole in the tree, it had curled up into a ball about the size of a soccer ball. Now that it was stretched out, it looked a little bigger.\"Little thing, are you really a Spiritual Beast?\" Tang Huan sized it up a few times, and said while looking rather fond of it.\"Yiya?\"The small blue beast tilted its head and blinked its large watery eyes as it looked at Tang Huan with a confused expression. It was obvious that it did not understand what Tang Huan meant by \"Spiritual Beast\". However, when it opened its mouth, Tang Huan could smell a faint smell of alcohol.\"You couldn't have stolen wine from some place and gotten drunk and fallen asleep, which was why you didn't notice the movements of the wolves and escaped in advance, right?\" This little thing's strength was low, but it was definitely unique in being able to survive in the Maze Realm Forest until now. The biggest possibility was that its Perception Ability was astonishing, and was able to sense all kinds of dangers long ago.\"Yiya!\" The two fleshy wings of the small blue beast drooped down. Its head was also drooping slightly. It seemed to be somewhat vexed.\"You are lucky that you met me. If it was anyone else, you would definitely have been eaten by a wolf.\"Seeing its dejected look, Tang Huan knew that it probably guessed right, but it didn't seem like he had brought the thought of wolves at all. He shamelessly laughed out loud. As it spoke, Tang Huan couldn't help but pick it up by pinching the sharp corner of its mouth.\"Yiya, yiya\" the little fellow flapped its wings with all its might, kicking its four limbs into the air as it struggled non-stop. It seemed to be very dissatisfied with Tang Huan's actions.\"This is bad!\"Just as Tang Huan was preparing to tease the little fellow, his expression suddenly changed, and he stood up from the ground, but he stumbled and almost fell again, and quickly grabbed onto a tree trunk to stabilize his body, \"There are so many dead wolves, it is very possible that they will attract many wild beasts over, we cannot stay here any longer, we have to leave quickly, otherwise, it will really be dangerous.\"After that, Tang Huan placed the little fellow on his shoulder: \"Are you following me, or are you planning to leave on your own?\"\"Yiya!\"The little fellow whined angrily as it grabbed the torn and tattered cloth that Tang Huan was wearing and quickly slipped away. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared from the dense forest.He got angry just like that?Tang Huan was startled, but regained his senses, as he felt a sense of loss in his heart.When the wolf approached it, the little fellow first ran away in fear, but then it bravely ran back, wanting to wake him up. This caused Tang Huan to be even more fond of it, furthermore, the little fellow was truly a lovable creature, and even Tang Huan risked his life to save it, hoping that it would stay behind.However, since it had chosen to leave, Tang Huan did not force it.After a while, Tang Huan calmed himself down, endured the waves of pain and fatigue, retrieved the Fire Cloud Sword and sword sheath, and started running frantically.Not long after he left, a small blue head emerged from the grass, shrank back, and emerged again.There seemed to be hesitation flickering in its pair of dark blue eyes.\"Yiya!\"His head went in and out of the grass a few times, but the little guy still ran out and chased after Tang Huan's figure that had disappeared.\"This is the Spiritual Beast 'Blue Dragon'.\"After a long while, a fat old man walked over from the side of the head wolf's corpse while mumbling, \"This kid is really bold. He only has so little strength, yet he dared to slip down and fight with the wolf pack.\" This wolf was as strong as the Stage Three Martial Disciple. However, this guy's dog shit luck is pretty good, he actually met such a rare Spiritual Beast, and even risked his life to save it. \"\"Tsk tsk, looks like the Blue Dragon has decided on him.\"As he finished speaking, the old man's chubby face revealed a hint of unconcealable envy. Blue Dragon was ranked third among all the Spirit Beasts Board in the world.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: 32Chapter 32 - Xiao Budian!Rushing for more than ten kilometers in the dense forest, Tang Huan had almost used up all of his remaining strength.With great difficulty, he climbed up a large tree that was more than ten meters tall. He could not hold on any longer, and fainted as he lay on two parallel branches on top of them.After slumbering for an unknown period of time, in a daze, Tang Huan felt a cool liquid enter his mouth, which then quickly flowed down his throat.As soon as it entered his stomach, the coldness began to spread crazily, spreading to his limbs and organs.\"Is it raining?\"This thought flashed past Tang Huan's mind out of reflex, but his mouth subconsciously made a \"pa da\" sound as the cool liquid continuously dripped into his mouth.As the cold feeling engulfed his entire body, Tang Huan felt as if he was drinking nectar, all thirty-six thousand pores on the surface of his body expanded, his entire body felt incomparably comfortable, the sense of exhaustion was immediately swept away, and even the pain that spread all over his body and organs was quickly being eliminated.This kind of wondrous feeling made Tang Huan unwilling to open his eyes, and he couldn't wait to immerse himself within it.Not long after, Tang Huan felt as if he had been reborn. His entire person became energetic, as if every cell and every nerve was jumping.\"Awesome! That's not right!\"Tang Huan groaned in comfort, but at this moment, he suddenly realised that something was not right. It was still in the summer, how could there be such a cold rain water.In the next moment, Tang Huan suddenly opened his eyes.The first thing that caught his eye was that impressively deep blue little head. It was the little blue beast that had slipped away before. His mouth was less than two inches away from his face.\"Little thing, it's you!\"Tang Huan shouted in surprise and joy. He held the little guy's head in his hands and turned around to sit up, his face was filled with a dense smile, and he had thought that after the little guy left, he would never see it again.What was it doing?\"Fuck, you're actually feeding me your saliva?\" Tang Huan finally realized what had happened earlier and his face couldn't help but turn black. He couldn't help but curse in his previous life; there was no rain here, which meant that what he drank just now wasn't rain at all.Since it wasn't rain, then it could only be saliva. Just now, that little fellow's tongue had almost touched his mouth.\"Yiya!\" \"Yiya!\"The blue beast waved its two little claws towards Tang Huan with all its might, its large eyes filled with a human expression of grievance and anger.\"You mean that's not saliva?\" It took Tang Huan a while to understand what it meant.\"Yiya!\"As the little blue beast cried out, it nodded its head heavily. Then, it stretched out its front paw and scratched the golden horn on the front of its head.Just by looking at it, Tang Huan noticed that the color of the sharp horn had become much dimmer.When he thought about the drop of golden liquid in the little fellow's mouth, Tang Huan immediately understood. He pointed to the golden horn and asked, \"You're feeding me something inside?\"\"Yiya!\" Lan nodded repeatedly, looking at Tang Huan out of the corner of his eyes, as though he was dissatisfied.\"That's fine. I've wrongly accused you. I'm sorry, I apologize. The thing in your horn is truly a treasure.\"Tang Huan scratched the back of his head and laughed, but he was moved in his heart.Not only was the Golden Horn dim, its expression was also one of exhaustion. It could be seen that after feeding him the golden liquid, it had already lost a lot of its strength while she himself \u2026Tang Huan subconsciously looked at his arm. The wound on his arm that was bitten by the Black Wolf was completely scabbed over, he couldn't feel anything at all.At most, it would take a day or two for the scab to heal.This surprised Tang Huan even more. The little guy's golden liquid was actually so marvelous, able to make his injuries improve to such an extent so quickly, and the wonderful thing about the golden liquid was not only healing his injuries. At the same time, he could feel that the Genuine Qi in his body seemed to have increased greatly.\"Little thing, no, I'll just call you 'Xiao Budian'. From now on, you are my friend. From now on, you can stay by my side.\" Tang Huan stretched out his right hand at the little guy.\"Yiya?\" \"Yiya!\"The blue beast first looked at Tang Huan with some suspicion, but after a while, it seemed to understand something. It suddenly nodded and stretched out a front paw on Tang Huan's right palm.This little guy was indeed very smart.Tang Huan held onto Xiao Budian's claw with a smile on his face. He shook it a few times before releasing it: \"Xiao Budian, is there anything in this Maze Realm Forest that can help you recover?\"\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian nodded her head, her little claws pointing to the left.Tang Huan looked in a blink of an eye, and after thinking for a moment, he realised that the direction it pointed to was the direction that the Black Wolf s were fleeing in, so he caressed the Xiao Budian's head and laughed: \"Alright, we will go there later, I will cultivate for a while first, see if I can break through?\"\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian seemed to be a little suspicious, but she still nodded her head.Tang Huan immediately took a light breath and sat on the branch as he began to circulate the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\". After the abundant Genuine Qi gathered at the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", it no longer rushed forward like it used to and calmly approached the seventh Spiritual Meridian.Among the nine Spiritual Meridian s, the first six were Spiritual Meridian s that connected the bones and limbs, and the last three were Spiritual Meridian s that connected the organs.As a result, after opening the three Spiritual Meridian s, the difficulty increased exponentially. It was also because of this that many Martial Warriors s were stuck at the water divide between Stage Two Martial Disciple and Stage Three Martial Disciple for a long time.However, if he were to open the last three Spiritual Meridian s, his internal organs would become much stronger, and his strength would increase by leaps and bounds.Tang Huan calmed his mind and focused, closing his eyes, his expression focused.The Xiao Budian curiously looked at Tang Huan, and after a moment, she imitated Tang Huan's actions and coiled up her legs, sitting motionlessly. However, after a short while, the Xiao Budian started to feel as if she was sitting on pins and needles, her butt started to twist non-stop, and she started to moan.\"It connected!\" \"It's cleared!\"After a long while, a sudden yell made Xiao Budian slide down from the tree branch, she immediately grabbed onto a protruding tree branch and jumped up, only to see Tang Huan dancing with joy, his face covered with blood stains was filled with joy and excitement.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: 33Chapter 33 - Great Harvest?\"Whoosh!\"In the dense forest, Tang Huan leaped as if he was flying.At this moment, he was completely naked from the waist up. The clothes that had been torn to shreds by the wolves had been tied around his waist, covering his vitals. As for the Fire Cloud Sword, Tang Huan simply took out a flexible vine and tied it around his back.Even though he had been running in the forest for close to a quarter of an hour, Tang Huan's heart was still agitated.Earlier, what he unlocked was not a single Spiritual Meridian, but consecutively opened the seventh and eighth Spiritual Meridian. At the moment, although the Spiritual Meridian had not expanded, it had increased sharply.Thinking back to that scene, Tang Huan still felt that it was inconceivable.The golden liquid that the Xiao Budian produced from its horns was unexpectedly this effective! Spiritual Beast were indeed Spiritual Beast s, no wonder they could make wolves salivate.\"Yiya!\"Suddenly, the Xiao Budian sitting on her left shoulder called out happily, her little claws pointing forward.Looking in the direction it was pointing, he saw a cliff that was a few hundred meters away. Tang Huan immediately ran. Once they were in front of the cliff, the Xiao Budian slipped off Tang Huan's shoulder and jumped onto a rock close to the cliff.Immediately after, an image that stupefied Tang Huan appeared. That large patch of moss had been lifted open like a curtain by the Xiao Budian, revealing a one meter tall hole.\"This, this \u2026\"Tang Huan exclaimed in his heart.This Xiao Budian sure knew how to hide her trump card. Let's not talk about the hole in the tree that was previously covered in bark, she must have been drunk to the point of being unnatural. In addition, he must have been scared to the point of making some noise. However, the cave covered in moss was now one with its surroundings. Who would have thought that beneath the almost undamaged moss was a completely different world?\"Yiya, yiya.\"The height and width of the cave was around 1.5m and Tang Huan was 1.7m tall, so he could still enter with a bent waist.After putting down the moss, the cave was pitch black, but the blue colored body was the guiding light. Xiao Budian was running in front with big steps, while Tang Huan followed behind with his back bent like a cat.The top of the hill was located about ten meters away from the cliff. After the top of the hill, there seemed to be many different coloured lights flashing around.\"Yiya!\"Tang Huan bumped his head thrice consecutively before he bared his teeth and climbed up the slope. Looking down, he could see that at the end of the cave which was around ten metres away from the cliff, a bright and colorful light illuminated the two meter radius area around it, lighting up the cave completely.At that moment, Xiao Budian was lying right in the middle of the colorful light.\"Gem!\"Tang Huan shouted out emotionally, and even his breathing became rapid, the light emitting from the gems with different appearances.Flaming \"Fire Cloud Stone\" and \"Scarlet Rainbow Stone\", snow-white \"Frozen Soul Stone\" and \"Shadow Moon Stone\", yellow \"Profound Stone\", dark blue \"Water Immortal Stone\", black \"Ink Spirit Stone\", purple \"Thunder Light Stone\", etc. all of them were low-grade gems, adding up to a dozen or so species.At the end of the stone cave, not only were there colourful colors, there were also various types of auras that were transmitted over. Some were cold, some were scorching hot, some were berserk, and some were soft.\"There should be at least over a hundred of them, this is a bountiful harvest!\"Tang Huan's eyes lit up, he never thought that Xiao Budian would actually be a rich man, collecting so many gems.But at the next moment, as if he had been struck on the head, Tang Huan let out a blood-curdling scream as he looked at the bottom of the hole in pain. At this time, Xiao Budian coincidentally grabbed a \"Thunder Light Stone\" that was brimming with purple light and stuffed it into his mouth.\"Yiya?\"The Xiao Budian raised his head and looked at Tang Huan in confusion. His little claws had once again stuffed a \"Ice Soul Stone\" into his mouth.Tang Huan covered his eyes, the pain in his heart was unbearable to look at.The Xiao Budian could not understand what Tang Huan was doing. Baffled, he blinked his eyes a few times, then completely ignored this weird fellow, waving his two little claws, sending one gem after another into his mouth. After chewing for a few times, he turned into a pile of crushed stone and spat it out at the side.When Xiao Budian ate more than a dozen gems, Tang Huan still couldn't help but slip to the bottom of the cave.At this time, Tang Huan finally noticed that the area around the cave had accumulated a large amount of stone dregs, at least several hundred of them.F * ck, there are hundreds of gems here, but I've never seen so many in my life.Tang Huan's heart twitched uncontrollably as he stared at Xiao Budian. Every time it entered his mouth, his throat would throb.\"Yiya?\"The little claw stopped at the corner of his mouth, looked at the brightly colored \"Golden Red Stone\" in the claw, and then looked at Tang Huan. He seemed to be unwilling to part with Tang Huan, but not long after, the Xiao Budian finally clenched her teeth and passed the \"Golden Red Stone\" to Tang Huan.\"Xiao Budian, you eat, you eat!\" Tang Huan forced out a smile that was uglier than crying.\"Yiya!\"The Xiao Budian didn't seem to understand, but his movements were unhesitatingly. With a happy cry, he waved his little claws and the \"Golden Red Stone\" entered his mouth.Tang Huan's heart twitched once again, but he quickly discovered that Xiao Budian's golden horn had become a bit brighter, and a bit more spirit appeared in his large eyes.\"So that's how it is.\"Tang Huan finally came to his senses. The Xiao Budian was relying on these gems to recover. After he understood this point, Tang Huan's heart finally felt at ease, but then his expression changed. Xiao Budian not only relied on the gem to recover, they also used the gem as food.If I have to eat precious stones everyday, how will I feed it in the future?Tang Huan wailed from the bottom of his heart, his facial features twisted, looking extremely miserable. Xiao Budian didn't seem to notice Tang Huan's vexation at all as he happily devoured the stone like a tornado. For a time, the only sounds that remained at the bottom of the hole were the chewing sounds and the sound of rocks being spat out.\"Yiya, eh \u2026\"Not long after, Tang Huan who was scratching his ears and cheeks was awakened by the clear and crisp shout. He looked up, only to see Xiao Budian sprawled out on the ground, her white, small belly bulging out as she burped contentedly, his eyes narrowing slightly as if she was drunk from eating and drinking to her heart's content.Beside the Xiao Budian, not a single gem was left.\"Have you finished eating?\" Tang Huan said in a daze. He had thought that the Xiao Budian would at least leave a few pellets.\"Uhhh \u2026 uhhh \u2026\" Xiao Budian burped twice in succession before opening up a small claw. Inside was a white \"Shadow Moon Stone\", and it was precisely because of this gem that the cave maintained its light. It was very possible that Xiao Budian had kept it to light up the cave.\"Fine.\" Tang Huan was completely defeated, he held his forehead and lamented, \"Xiao Budian, you've finished your meal, what do you want to eat next time?\"\"Yiya!\"When Xiao Budian heard him, she immediately rolled over with her round belly, and crawled to the outside using her four limbs. But after crawling less than a meter, she rolled down, and it was the same repeated times.Tang Huan could not bear to watch any longer, he grabbed the frustrated Xiao Budian and placed it on his shoulder.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: 34What a bountiful harvest!\"Xiao Budian, is there really a gem here?\"After a long while, in the depths of a valley, Tang Huan suspiciously sized up the surrounding precipice that was shaped like a round barrel.Once he exited the cave, under the guidance of the Xiao Budian, Tang Huan went straight to the valley.\"Yiya!\"The Xiao Budian glared at Tang Huan, as if she was dissatisfied with his question. He called out to him crisply, then slipped to the ground and as if an old horse knew his way around, he walked to the side of a small tree on the cliff.With his round belly, Xiao Budian walked around the tree a few times slowly before he beckoned with his claws at Tang Huan and pointed at the roots of the tree.\"Here?\"Tang Huan looked at Xiao Budian suspiciously, he took out his Fire Cloud Sword and instantly chopped down the small tree, and started to dig in the surroundings. Not long after, Tang Huan had pulled up the roots of the tree, revealing a hole, where a few green rays of light were faintly discernible in the soil.Tang Huan's eyes lit up, his hands quickly dug into the pit, and with a flick of his finger, an emerald gem that had a walnut laugh appeared.\"Jade Light Stone!\"Tang Huan could not help but exclaim, his face full of uncontrollable surprise.This \"Jade Light Stone\" contained life force. Holding a weapon forged from this kind of gem could dispel fatigue, allowing oneself to maintain an exuberant amount of energy. What was even more strange was that it could also heal injuries. This was definitely a low-grade gem that was much more precious than the \"Thunder Light Stone\". A \"Jade Light Stone\" was worth more than five hundred gold coins, and the low-grade weapons that were forged from it were worth nearly a thousand gold coins.Nobody knew how all sorts of gems were formed in this world. It was almost impossible to find any kind of gems anywhere. Some of them were minerals that were formed from a large number of similar gems, while others were scattered all over the place and mixed together with the other gems.The Maze Realm Forest was a place where all kinds of low level gems were mixed together.Wherever the gem existed, all sorts of anomalies would be revealed.For example, where there were Fire Cloud Stone s, their surroundings were usually barren. But where there were places that did not have Fire Cloud Stone s, there might not even be Fire Cloud Stone s. Some of the more powerful Martial Warriors, with their astonishing senses, could easily find all kinds of gems. If their strength was insufficient, they could only rely on their own experience.Although the biggest contributor was the Xiao Budian, this did not lessen the excitement in Tang Huan's heart.\"I reckon there's more than one 'Jade Light Stone' among them.\"Tang Huan beamed, his hands moving extremely quickly.A few minutes later, Tang Huan stopped and sat by the side of the pit, grinning from ear to ear, while beside his feet, six Jade Light Stone laid quietly.These gems alone were worth more than three thousand gold coins.It was indeed a bountiful harvest!The most important thing was that although this kind of \"Jade Light Stone\" was also a low-grade gem, it was extremely rare. Amongst the Gem Store s, it was rare to see a few \"Jade Light Stone\" being sold year round.All the Gem Store s in the Furious Waves City only sell this many \"Jade Light Stone\" in one year.\"Yiya, yiya\" Xiao Budian held her stomach and opened her small wings. Her two small claws hugged her chest and proudly swayed left and right in front of Tang Huan.\"Stop shaking, I know you're amazing. Come on, come on, we'll keep looking!\" Tang Huan laughed.\"Yiya?\" Xiao Budian stopped and looked at the pile of Jade Light Stone, licking it with his small red tongue.\"You're still eating today?\" Tang Huan couldn't help but look at its round belly.\"Yiya.\" Xiao Budian's head was nodding like a chicken pecking rice.\"Okay, take it!\" Tang Huan was a little speechless, but he still straightforwardly picked up the two Jade Light Stone s and threw them towards Xiao Budian.\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian's head shook, and the two gems entered her mouth and with a few kacha kacha sounds, she spat out a pile of green coloured rock. Xiao Budian looked at him in the blink of an eye. After sniffing a few times with her nose, she jumped and ran in another direction.In the following ten days, Tang Huan spent every day following Xiao Budian around the Maze Realm Forest, digging out more and more precious stones.\"The ninth Spiritual Meridian has finally been unlocked!\"Within a hidden space formed by a few large rocks, Tang Huan suddenly opened his eyes with a face brimming with surprise.After consuming the golden liquid inside the Xiao Budian's Horn, Tang Huan's speed of widening the Spiritual Meridian had greatly increased. Until yesterday, the first seven channels were equivalent to the eighth Spiritual Meridian. As a result, after the night fell, Tang Huan began to attempt the ninth Spiritual Meridian. After an entire night, he finally succeeded.\"It's Stage Three Martial Disciple now!\"Feeling the surging Genuine Qi from the nine Spiritual Meridian s, Tang Huan was deeply moved. When this unfamiliar world came to life again, he had never dreamed that he could become a Stage Three Martial Disciple so quickly.A soft groan came out. Xiao Budian, who was sleeping soundly on the huge bundle at the side, woke up, rubbed her sleepy eyes, looked at Tang Huan in a daze, then turned over and fell asleep again.The package below him was actually Tang Huan's tent back then.The day that Tang Huan found the \"Jade Light Stone\", he returned to the place where he had encountered the wolf pack and found the tent and clothing that he had thrown away previously. After that, the tent was made into a package by Tang Huan to store all sorts of low level gems.The was the biggest family, and they probably did not have as many low-grade gems in stock as he did. Furthermore, they would not be as complete as he had wrapped them all up. Merely the \"Jade Light Stone\" which had increased to eighteen, was not something that the Gem Store could take out.Of course, what was left now, was only around two hundred, and the rest had all been eaten by the Xiao Budian.But even if it was only two hundred of them, it was enough for Tang Huan to wake up from his dreams smiling.With these gems, he was confident that his refining ability would be greatly increased, and he would even be able to forge some low-grade weapons of the highest quality. Yesterday, Tang Huan had already made a decision. No matter if he could open the ninth meridian or not, he would leave Maze Realm Forest today and return to Furious Waves City.This place was already close to the depths of Maze Realm Forest, it was extremely dangerous to search further.\"Small.\"Tang Huan got up and was about to wake the little fellow up, but just as he spoke out the words, Xiao Budian quivered and suddenly turned around and sat up. His ears that were lying on the ground suddenly perked up like a sail, then he jumped out of his bag and ran to the crevice of the rock to sniff and sniff.\"Beasts are approaching?\" Tang Huan frowned, and listened attentively, but did not hear anything.\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian immediately nodded her head. With a serious face, she patted the stone with her claw that was slightly smaller than normal.\"Danger? Leave immediately? \" After interacting with the Xiao Budian for so many days, Tang Huan easily understood what it wanted to express.\"Good!\" We will leave now! \"Without waiting for Xiao Budian's reply, Tang Huan immediately made her decision. In this period of time, relying on Xiao Budian's super strong Perception Ability, Tang Huan had avoided many strong beast packs. Since Xiao Budian felt danger, it meant that the wild beasts that appeared were very powerful.\"Awoooo \u2014\"But just as Tang Huan was about to push the stone away, a loud wolf howl suddenly came out.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: 35Chapter 35 - Demon General s of the fourth stepA pack of wolves again?Tang Huan frowned slightly as his hands paused. The location where the voice came from was probably only a few hundred meters away, and the place where she and Xiao Budian were hiding at was a vast pile of rocks. If they were to run out now, they would probably be discovered by the wolves.Xiao Budian seemed to understand this point. He was anxious to the point that his tail was sticking out as he kept moving around.\"Don't worry, I'm here!\"Tang Huan rubbed Xiao Budian's head and said in a low voice. Although the tone of his words was low and extremely firm, Xiao Budian looked at Tang Huan and finally calmed down a little.Giving it a faint smile, Tang Huan approached the crack in the rock.Then, an exceptionally tall and sturdy figure entered Tang Huan's line of sight. That fellow leaped towards this pile of rocks at an astonishing speed. After a short moment, when Tang Huan could clearly see the appearance of the figure, he was stunned like a wooden chicken, and his eyes widened.What came over was actually a monster with a human body and wolf head.That guy's body was very muscular and sturdy, like a human being. However, on his neck, there was a ferocious wolf head with thick fur. On the back of his neck, there was also a large cluster of long and thick mane that extended from his head all the way to his back.The creature had extremely long arms, and its front claws were almost reaching its knees. Its two claws were also human like, but compared to human hands, they were thicker and sharper. Moreover, they were as red as fire. There was a piece of beast skin wrapped around its waist. Dark red patches could be seen on the beast skin; it seemed to be blood stains.\"Is this the Demon Clan?\"Looking at the huge human-shaped wolf, Tang Huan was flabbergasted, \"And, the Werewolf?\"This was not the first time Tang Huan had met the Demon Clan, and within the Furious Waves City, there were shops that specialized in selling captured Demon Clan s as slaves. When he was young, he had snuck into the shops and opened his eyes a few times. However, this was the first time Tang Huan had seen the Werewolf in the Demon Clan.Behind the Werewolf were a few sturdy Silver Wolf s, and behind the Silver Wolf were tens of Black Wolf s.Tang Huan faintly discovered that a few Black Wolf s had charred spots on their bodies. It was very likely that they were the remaining wolves that fled in panic due to him.Tang Huan was not particularly surprised that the Demon Clan had appeared here.Back then, on the passenger ship heading to Crescent City, he and Qiu Jian had chatted on the way and learned a lot of things.Although the Demon Clan army was forced to retreat, there were still a large number of defeated Demon Clan soldiers scattered all over the continent.Humans could absorb spiritual energy, cultivate Genuine Qi and specialize in weapon techniques.Demon Clan usually had an exceptionally tough body and powerful strength. Having grown up in an extremely poor environment, his appearance was also quite strange. The Demon Clan was formed not only by mutated monsters like the Werewolf, but also by demons, Demonized Humans and other strange races.\"I wonder what stage Werewolf is at?\"Tang Huan thought for a while, then continued to scan Werewolf's body with both of his eyes.The level of Demon Clan was extremely strict, and on their bodies, it was extremely obvious that they were of the same level.Only after both parties had shortened it by quite a bit did Tang Huan finally see a two finger-sized horn on Werewolf's waist that was emitting a light blue luster.\"A light blue fourth stage Demon General!\"This thought flashed across Tang Huan's mind at lightning speed, and he couldn't help but take a deep breath.In Demon Clan, the first to third stage is considered magic weapon, which is equivalent to the human Martial Disciple, and the fourth to sixth stage is considered Demon General, which is equivalent to the human Martial Master. The blue horn was usually the symbol of a Demon General, a light blue, fourth stage Demon General, sky blue a fifth stage Demon General, and deep blue a sixth stage Demon General.The Demon General of the fourth step was the Stage Four Martial Master of the human race.However, due to the Demon Clan's powerful flesh body and strength, even the weakest of the fourth stage Demon General would be able to contend against the powerful Stage Four Martial Master, and the powerful fourth stage Demon General would even be able to compete with some of the Stage Five Martial Master s. It was because of this that the human army was being pushed back little by little in the early stages of the war.\"If this Werewolf finds out, we will really be in for it!\"Not only was there a Demon General at the fourth stage, there were also three Silver Wolf s and dozens of Black Wolf s outside. Judging from their position behind the Werewolf, the Silver Wolf was clearly weaker than the Werewolf, but it was stronger than the numerous other Black Wolf s.Counting it this way, the three Silver Wolf s were probably comparable to the head wolf that Tang Huan burnt to death with his True Fire.\"Hu!\"With a single step, Werewolf traversed two to three meters. After a while, he whistled past the crack on the ground, not stopping at all.Just as Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief, he discovered that a tall brown figure had appeared a dozen metres away from the tiny crevice. The Werewolf had actually turned back.Xiao Budian also seemed to have noticed the great danger and didn't even dare to breathe heavily. She curled up into a ball beside Tang Huan and trembled.\"Damn, this is the second time I've been so unlucky!\"Tang Huan cursed as he moved his head away from the crevice. Last time, for safety's sake, he had chosen an open area in the shrubbery for the night. This time, he had met with a pack of wolves and even chose to temporarily stay in a rock pile where there were basically no wild beasts, but he had met an even more powerful enemy.His body was already smeared with the scent concealment juice found by the Xiao Budian, but he was still able to be discovered!Right now, not only did the Werewolf stay outside, even the wolves seemed to have stopped. One could even faintly hear their \"huff\" and \"huff\" sounds of heavy breathing.\"Awoo!\"An earth-shaking roar suddenly sounded out, followed by a cold voice that sounded like a broken gong, \"Who's hiding there, come out!\"Tang Huan understood that if he stayed any longer, both he and Xiao Budian would be exposed when the Werewolf lifted the stone himself.As he thought about it, Tang Huan picked up the Xiao Budian, pressed his mouth tightly against its ear, and spoke with an extremely low voice: \"Stay here, don't move!\"Xiao Budian kept her mouth shut and shook her head.Tang Huan pretended not to see it, and with that said, he placed it in a corner. He fiercely clenched his teeth, pushed away the rock at the side, and quickly fled while sticking close to the ground.The moment he went out, Tang Huan's right foot stomped on the ground, causing the stone to return to its original position.\"Your father is right here. If you have the ability, come and kill me!\"\"Is there anyone else?\"Just as Tang Huan jumped onto another huge boulder, he suddenly heard these words and his legs staggered. He almost fell down head first.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: 36Chapter 36 - Fighting against WerewolfUsing all of his strength to stabilize his footsteps, Tang Huan looked over in shock. He saw that to the north, about 10m away, in a pile of rocks close to the forest, there were five young men holding onto swords, standing arrogantly.Did these five just come out of the woods?Just now, Werewolf had found out that it was them, not herself!This caused Tang Huan to be even more certain of his judgement. If he had not come out just now, the Werewolf would most likely have brought the wolf pack and ran straight towards the five fellows.However, it was too late for regret now that he had appeared!Those five young men were sloppy and sloppy, obviously because they too had stayed in Maze Realm Forest for quite a long time. Seeing Tang Huan suddenly appearing, they were wild with joy after their initial shock.The five quickly exchanged glances, and a man in black shouted, \"Friend, come over here quickly. Let's work together and kill this group of beasts!\"\"I'm not interested. You guys can stay here and kill them yourselves!\"Tang Huan yelled in annoyance, and continued to run forward without looking back. What he was thinking right now was to stay away from the Xiao Budian, so that it wouldn't be discovered even more easily.\"Awoo!\"Seeing that, the brown Werewolf suddenly roared towards the wolves.Instantly, as if listening to an imperial decree, the three Silver Wolf s and the tens of Black Wolf s all ran towards the five young men at the same time. When some of the Black Wolf s saw Tang Huan, they were already terrified. Now that they saw that there was no need to fight Tang Huan, they ran even faster.swish *Following that, Werewolf personally leaped towards Tang Huan with extreme speed.The distance between him and Tang Huan was extremely close to begin with, but now that they were chasing with all their strength, the distance between the two parties was quickly shortened. In a short moment, they had already caught up to Tang Huan.\"Humans, die!\"Werewolf opened her bloody mouth and roared, her sturdy body shot up into the sky like lightning, his sharp right claw cut towards Tang Huan's neck at the speed of lightning, and wherever the claw passed, it actually caused a slight whistling sound, as though even the air was being torn apart by his sharp, fiery-red claws.\"Plop!\"Almost at the same time, Tang Huan fell horizontally onto the ground, rolled twice at lightning speeds, and suddenly stood up straight like a carp. With a clang, the Fire Cloud Sword on his back quickly came out of its scabbard and a red light flashed across the sky, the tip of the sword had already cut across Werewolf's abdomen with a blazing heat.After opening nine Spiritual Meridian s, not only did Tang Huan's Genuine Qi increase explosively, his speed, reaction speed, as well as his senses, had also improved greatly. If it was in the past, even if Tang Huan had detected the movements of the Werewolf, he would not have been able to react so quickly.In the end, they could only choose to fight against Werewolf head on.However, such an opponent was the most unsuitable for a head-on clash. If they really fought head on, Tang Huan reckoned that his Fire Cloud Sword would be smacked away.\"En!\"Werewolf's claw struck empty air and at the same time, her mouth let out a stuffy groan of pain.Tang Huan dragged his sword backwards, and his short body swept past Werewolf's side.That sword just now, was out of his expectations. Although it had stabbed into Werewolf's body, the muscles on his abdomen were extremely tenacious. Tang Huan actually had the feeling that the tip of the sword had cut across a stone slab. Even though he heard Werewolf's humph, Tang Huan did not turn his head to check the results, because he was very clear, his attack just now could not possibly have dealt much damage to the Werewolf, it most likely had only left a burnt wound on his abdomen.\"Hu!\"Tang Huan activated his Genuine Qi and ran around the pile of rocks as fast as he could, trying to get as far away from the hiding place as possible.\"Awoo!\"An angry roar came from behind him.Werewolf opened her mouth wide, her fangs fierce, her eyes gleaming with a cold light, \"Human, you actually hurt me, when I catch you, I will tear you into pieces and eat you whole!\"This brown colored Werewolf was a level 4 Demon General, naturally she could feel that Tang Huan was almost at the same level as a human. She thought that she could easily pinch him to death like a bug, but she didn't think that Tang Huan's reaction would be so quick.That little injury would not affect him at all, but it had completely ignited his anger, he wanted nothing more than to grab onto Tang Huan and ravage him.After about 10 metres, the Werewolf caught up to Tang Huan once again.\"Hu!\"With a loud whistling sound, Werewolf directly swiped his claw at Tang Huan's head. With great force and power, his claw seemed to contain a thousand kilograms of strength.Tang Huan did not turn back, but it was as if he had eyes on his back. His feet slipped, and then slipped through the edge of the boulder and into the crevice below. The reason why he had intentionally dashed along the edge of the boulder just now was precisely for this purpose. In times of danger, it would be easier to avoid attacks.\"Cunning human!\"Seeing that, the Werewolf was even more furious, and also jumped down.The stone crevice was two meters deep and one meter wide. After extending for about ten meters, it suddenly turned to the left. Just as Werewolf was about to turn the corner, an extremely sharp red light suddenly shot out from the left, aiming straight for Werewolf's abdomen. It was actually as fast as lightning.\"Stupid thing, you think a sneak attack like this can hurt me? How ridiculous! \"Werewolf laughed sinisterly, raising his arm to slap the red light, but in her fury, she actually forgot that she was still in the crevice. The moment his arm was raised, her elbow smashed into the right side of the stone wall, causing the entire boulder to shake violently.Aooo! Werewolf couldn't bear the pain anymore, she hugged her elbow and screamed.But at this time, the red light swept across his abdomen without any delay, precisely at the small wound Tang Huan had made on his abdomen earlier.\"Zizi!\"With the sound of his skin and hair being burnt, the wound immediately became much deeper. Werewolf roared again in pain, but immediately took a step forward and kicked towards the corner. However, after Tang Huan stabbed out, it immediately withdrew its sword and retreated. Its leg completely missed.Both sides continued to chase each other through the cracks between the rocks.However, Tang Huan was overjoyed. He realized that the cracks in the stone wall were like a maze, connected to all directions. It would be greatly beneficial for him if he could stay in this place with the stubborn Werewolf. In an open space, it was extremely difficult for Tang Huan to dodge, but in this place, it was very different.After a moment, two paths appeared in front of him at the same time. Tang Huan immediately went towards the left.Werewolf was furious beyond compare, but after the previous lesson, he couldn't help but slow down, carefully moving closer to the left passageway.Suddenly, a young and clear voice came from the right side of the path.Werewolf was startled, she immediately looked over, and saw a small blue figure running frantically through the cracks in the stone, but before he could see his appearance clearly, another red light flashed out from the left side of the fork.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: 37Chapter 37 - Taking the initiative first!\"Awoo!\"Werewolf's pained cry once again resounded above the pile of rubble.In between the rocks, Tang Huan started to run wildly. He never thought that the Xiao Budian would actually run out of her hiding place in such a audacious manner, and even attract the attention of the Werewolf on the other side.However, although Tang Huan was shocked by its action, his reaction was not slow at all, and did not waste the great opportunity that the Xiao Budian had risked to create.After the sword attack, the wound on Werewolf's abdomen deepened once again. The wound as well as the skin on both sides had become charred black by the scorching heat.With the same wound being pierced three times in a row, the Werewolf was even more crazed. She endured the pain in her stomach and chased after it with all her might.It didn't take long for two more forks to appear in front of them.Werewolf slowed down her pace and cautiously approached.\"Yiya!\"This time, the voice came from the left.Werewolf clenched her teeth and laughed coldly to herself. What a hopeless fool, using the same trick twice, thinking that this Demon General would fall for it?\"Hu!\" With almost no hesitation, Werewolf tilted her body and smashed her left claw fiercely into the right side of the fork.\"No one?\"Not only did the claw strike nothing, but the right path was also missing.Just as he was about to turn back and look at the left path, he felt a sharp pain from his abdomen that was mixed with tearing and burning. At the same time, a figure rushed from the left side to the crack in the stone in front. On his shoulder, there was a small ball of blue figure.\"Awoo!\"Not only was Werewolf incomparably furious, she was also extremely aggrieved. How could this human be so cunning and hateful? Last time, it was clearly one on each side, so how could she get them to do the same thing this time?\"Damn human, I will never let you go!\"Werewolf roared crazily, she chased after his again, the color of her eyes turning dark red.However, the situation did not change at all. In this kind of environment, the Werewolf was completely unable to recover her superiority, and with the Xiao Budian's extremely coordinated attacks, she was able to deepen the wound on her abdomen little by little.\"We can't continue like this anymore!\"Werewolf's gaze was fierce, she stopped her steps and panted heavily.There were three additional wounds on his back, and the wound on his abdomen had endured three more strikes, before Werewolf's crazed head finally calmed down. In the spiderweb-like crevice, he was completely dragged by the nose, and if this continued, he would be dragged to his death.With his front claws on the edge of the rock, Werewolf shook his body and was about to jump up.\"Watch my sword!\"A loud shout suddenly sounded out, and in the next moment, Werewolf felt an exceptionally hot and sharp aura rise from between her legs.Even though the sharp light had yet to touch his vitals, it was enough to cause him an intense pain in his balls.The Werewolf who had just cleared her head immediately became furious once again. As she turned her hand to grab at the back, her body fell down once again. But the moment his feet touched the ground, Tang Huan's figure suddenly appeared in front of him. A ray of red light pierced into her abdomen from the wound with lightning speed.The Genuine Qi inside Tang Huan's body surged violently, the exceptionally powerful Power of True Fire burst out from his sword, and at that moment, the stomach of the Werewolf was probably going to be scorched black.\"Done!\"Tang Huan's heart relaxed, and he immediately retreated.\"Awoo!\" Werewolf let out a furious howl of pain. The muscles on her wound had actually closed, clamping tightly onto the Fire Cloud Sword that had pierced her abdomen.\"This is bad!\"Tang Huan sensed that the situation was not good, and immediately released the sword hilt and retreated quickly. At the same time, Werewolf's hand claw came over and grabbed his chest.Bang! Tang Huan's body flew backwards through the cracks in the stone and fell back close to ten meters.\"Damn, what great strength!\"Tang Huan's chest hurt, his vision went black, and he almost fainted from the pain.Time shook his head, Tang Huan tried his best to maintain his clarity of mind, and then he suddenly stood up and ran a few meters before turning around to the side.Werewolf only gave chase a few steps before she came to a stop.\"Hu!\"After running for more than 10 metres, Tang Huan then rubbed his chest and sat down, letting out a long breath.Hearing the roars from afar, Tang Huan's heart still had a lingering fear. If not for him reacting fast enough, immediately letting go of the sword hilt and retreating, allowing Werewolf to slap him with a palm that was not firm and forceful. Otherwise, his chest would have been smashed to pieces by now, causing him to lose all ability to resist.In that case, the painfully dying Werewolf could simply trample him to death.He had not died even after so long, yet when he was about to enjoy his victory, he was pulled down by the Werewolf to die together with him.\"Yiya, yiya\" Xiao Budian crawled out from an extremely narrow crack in front and climbed onto Tang Huan's leg, calling out in concern.\"It's nothing!\"Tang Huan held Xiao Budian's fleshy wings with both hands and laughed, but when he laughed, his laugh reached a sore point and he could not help but let out a stuffy groan. Xiao Budian couldn't help but stretch out his small claws and rub against Tang Huan's chest a few times.Tang Huan knew what the little fellow was planning to do at first glance, so he quickly pinched its mouth and ate the drops of golden liquid inside its little horn. It would probably need more than a few tens, or even hundreds of low rank gems to make up for the loss, and Tang Huan would rather endure the pain for a while and leave more to forge weapons.Tang Huan placed the Xiao Budian on his shoulder and then took a light breath. He stood up while enduring the pain, and slowly moved closer to that direction.Very quickly, Tang Huan saw her own Fire Cloud Sword that had been abandoned. About twenty meters away from the Fire Cloud Sword, Werewolf's robust and sturdy body was crawling on the ground, twitching slightly.Tang Huan did not dare to approach immediately. Picking up the Fire Cloud Sword, he crawled out of the crevice.The instant he went up, Tang Huan saw two figures. Those three Silver Wolf s and dozens of Black Wolf s had already disappeared without a trace. It was unknown if they were all killed or fled, but of the five young men, only two remained.They were clearly here to check out the situation, and were only around 10 metres away from Tang Huan.\"Friend, not bad. You can even kill such a powerful Werewolf.\" Seeing that Tang Huan's body basically did not sustain any injuries, the two young men were startled. However, when they glanced at the Xiao Budian who was squatting on Tang Huan's shoulder, their eyes flashed with deep shock and greed.\"You guys are also not bad, finish off the dozens of wolves.\" Tang Huan smiled faintly.\"Five people have come to this Maze Realm Forest, but only the two of us are left.\" A black clothed man laughed bitterly, and then, as if he had just realized the existence of the Xiao Budian, he curiously took two steps forward, \"Friend, what is that thing on your shoulder? \"He looks so cute. Can I touch his?\"\"No way!\" The corner of Tang Huan's mouth twitched.\"You \u2026\"Before the black clothed man finished speaking, he let out a painful groan. He looked down in disbelief at the broadsword between his chest and abdomen, the blade had already penetrated his body, the tip of the sword pierced through his back, fresh blood continuously dripping. At this time, the sword in his right hand just rose up.\"I'm sorry, I made the first move!\" Tang Huan pushed away the long sword in the black clothed man's hand that was about to slash at his own neck, and his lips curled into a mocking sneer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: 38Chapter 38 - Phoenix Blood Crystal\"Tang Huan, you are ruthless!\"The man in black opened his eyes wide, and his eyes that were filled with despair lost their light. Gradually, they became empty, and a trickle of blood flowed out from his mouth.\"Tang Huan?\"Hearing him call out his name, Tang Huan's heart skipped a beat. He instantly took out his Fire Cloud Sword and kicked the black clothed man onto the huge rock, then shot forward like an arrow leaving the bow, his sword thrusting straight towards the skinny man who was a few meters away.The skinny man was smiling, but unexpectedly, the situation changed and Tang Huan made the first move.Seeing the dripping blood on his comrade's sword tip, the skinny man's smile suddenly froze on his face. After hearing his companion call out the two words \"Tang Huan\", he realized that something was wrong, but he did not expect Tang Huan's reaction to be so quick, and the sharp sword immediately pointed at him.\"Stop! \"Friend, let's talk this out!\"The thin man quickly retreated and swung the sword in his hand to block the attack.Ding! Both swords clashed. The skinny man felt a strong force rushing towards him. His wrist went numb and the long sword immediately fell from his hand. This made him even more terrified.Originally, he thought that Tang Huan who was fighting with the Werewolf would expend a lot of energy, but the moment the two swords clashed, he knew that she was wrong, the Genuine Qi that her opponent had penetrated into the sword was actually still extremely strong and abundant, but he was already extremely exhausted. Under the impact of the Genuine Qi, he wasn't even able to hold onto her weapon.\"Friend? Aren't you supposed to call me Tang Huan? \"Tang Huan sneered, \"I knew that the bastards of Tang Family would come chasing after us, I just didn't expect you bastards to be chasing us here.\" While he was speaking, Tang Huan's movements were still extremely fast, he kept thrusting with the sword, forcing the other party into a sorry state.\"Tang Huan, if you kill me, Tang Family will definitely not let you go. If you let me go, I can still go back and say some good words to you.\"The skinny man had already retreated to the edge of the boulder. After hearing Tang Huan's words, he decided not to hide it anymore and tried to threaten him.However, before he finished speaking, his feet slipped and his body fell forward.\"Chi!\"Tang Huan's sword moved as fast as lightning, immediately rushing forward, piercing a hole through his.\"You, you, Tang Huan, I don't want to die!\" The skinny man's body stiffened. He looked down in disbelief at the sword he had stabbed into his chest.\"Don't come here if you don't want to die. Since you're here, don't blame me for being ruthless! \"Tang Huan ignored the pleading eyes of the skinny man, and sneered as he pulled out his sword. The skinny man collapsed to the ground, twitched a few times, and then stopped moving.Whoosh! Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief.It was not that his heart was as cold as ice or that he was ruthless, it was that if the two Tang Family s did not die, the one who died might be him.Just now, when he was just a little bit slower, the black clothed man's sword had already cut into his neck, so, the moment he heard his name, Tang Huan had already made his decision, to immediately kill the remaining person.In this Origin Continent, the only person who could call out his name the first time they met, other than Qiu Jian, who had already gone to the \"Two Realms Plain\", was the Tang Family who had chased him here from the Glory Continent.According to Tang Huan's estimations, the five Tang Family s should all be Stage Three Martial Disciple s. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to defeat those dozens of Black Wolf s and the three even more powerful Silver Wolf s.At this time, Tang Huan was rather grateful to the Werewolf.If not for him, Tang Huan would probably be fighting against the five Stage Three Martial Disciple s in no time at all. How could he be as relaxed as before, not even using his battle skills and Power of True Fire to kill the remaining two Tang Family s.However, although Tang Huan did not hold back when he attacked the two Tang Family s, he could not help but feel a little stifled looking at the two of them with their eyes opened wide.Whether it was his previous life or this life, this was the first time he had killed someone!\"I wonder how's the Werewolf doing?\"Tang Huan took a deep breath, suppressed the discomfort in his chest, and jumped into the crevice of the stone.After a while, Tang Huan was shocked by what he saw. The Werewolf actually covered his stomach and sat up, leaning on the stone wall and moaning non-stop.\"He's not dead?\" This life force is too tenacious! \" Tang Huan came back to his senses and stopped ten-odd meters away with a face full of caution.Werewolf looked at Tang Huan and roared deeply. There was no anger in his eyes, only pain.\"Alright!\"Tang Huan observed carefully for a moment and realised that Werewolf was extremely weak. She should not have any strength to fight anymore. Of course, even if the Werewolf was cheating, Tang Huan was not afraid. In this place, the Werewolf who was already heavily injured was basically unable to do anything to him.After walking a few steps, Tang Huan's heart suddenly moved: \"It's easy for me to kill you. Tell me first, what were you planning to do with that pack of wolves?\"He had long since been rather curious about it. As a Werewolf of a fourth stage Demon General, he should normally hide himself well, why would he bring a pack of wolves with him?\"I'm going to find someone.\" Werewolf's voice was hoarse.\"Looking for someone?\" After Tang Huan heard this, he became even more curious, \"Who are you looking for?\"\"There's a woman. That woman has a 'Phoenix Blood Crystal' on her. A few days ago, she and two other people unintentionally entered our encampment deep within the Maze Realm Forest. All of the soldiers in the encampment were killed, and due to a lucky coincidence, only one of them escaped and reported to Lord Wolf King. Lord Wolf King speculated that there was a high possibility that she had the 'Divine Weapon Catalogue's scroll' on his body. That's why we were ordered to search everywhere. \"Werewolf only wished for his to die quickly, and he actually revealed everything he knew as if he poured beans on the table.\"The remnant of 'Divine Weapon Catalogue'?\"Hearing these words, Tang Huan could not help but exclaim.The last time he had heard of \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" was from Qiu Jian's mouth, but this time, he had actually heard it from the Werewolf in front of him, who was a Rank Four Demon General.\"This is Lord Wolf King's speculation.\"The Werewolf shook her head in pain, \"As for how Lord Wolf King found out, I don't know. I am just a lowly Demon General of the fourth stage.\"After hearing about Lord Wolf King several times, Tang Huan suddenly came to a realization: \"You're talking about 'Lord Wolf King', is he one of the eight great Demon King s, 'Howling Firmament Wolf King'?\"\"Of course!\" Werewolf proudly raised her head, a light appearing in her eyes.\"The 'Howling Firmament Wolf King' is actually in the Maze Realm Forest?\" Tang Huan's heart trembled as he cried out involuntarily. From what Qiu Jian had said, Howling Firmament Wolf King was one of the eight great Demon King s under his command.\"That's right.\" \"Unfortunately, Lord Wolf King has already been severely injured, and has not yet recovered from his injuries.\"\"Did you find the woman?\" Tang Huan said again.\"Of course I found it. I just received news from my comrades, they have already found the woman's location over there, and it's only a few dozen kilometers away from here.\" After saying that, Werewolf's voice suddenly stopped, his eyes revealing a look of horror. He suddenly realized, he had revealed so much about Lord Wolf King, if this person lured the human expert over, wouldn't Lord Wolf King be in danger?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: 39Chapter 39 - Traces of War\"Since you're so cooperative, I won't torture you. I'll send you on your way!\"\"No, I \u2014\"Werewolf shook her head and struggled, as if she wanted to stand up.But in the next moment, his voice abruptly stopped.\"Chi!\"The Fire Cloud Sword streaked across his neck like lightning, and her ferocious wolf head flew out, blood spraying out from the nape of his neck. When the Werewolf was filled with energy, her flesh body would be extremely durable, but once it was exhausted, it would very quickly become soft, and Tang Huan could easily cut off his neck.Looking at the Werewolf's corpse that had its head separated from its body, Tang Huan felt no discomfort.In his eyes, this Demon Clan in the shape of a Werewolf was no different from the ones he had killed before. He naturally did not feel that this was the first time he had killed a human.However, at this moment, he couldn't help but be suspicious. Looking at Werewolf's expression just now, it seemed that he did not want to die.Was there really such a thing as a trap?Of course, regardless of whether the Werewolf was lying or not, he was already dead. Tang Huan was too lazy to think about it further.Divine Weapon Catalogue! That was a treasure that could forge Divine Weapon!Even if it was only a remnant scroll, it was likely to attract the envy of countless Martial Warriors, especially Weapon Refiner.Tang Huan tried his best to recall something related to \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\", but to no avail. That youth, Tang Huan, was simply too ignorant and ill-informed. If he had not heard Qiu Jian talk about it, he would not even know that there was this \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" thing.Of course, Tang Huan had heard of the word \"Divine Weapon\" several times. He knew that it was the most powerful weapon in the world.It was precisely because of this that it was so hard for Tang Huan to make a decision now.When he came to this world, he had once again become a low level Weapon Refiner. When he heard \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\", he could not help but be moved by the idea, he did not actually have to take the fragment for himself, he just wanted to see what it looked like.But now that even the Howling Firmament Wolf King s under the command of the Demon Lord Fen Tian were all gathered at the Maze Realm Forest, the number of routed soldiers gathered at his side was definitely not a small number.Werewolf had long since obtained the woman's whereabouts, and had been delayed here for a long time, so she was sure that Howling Firmament Wolf King would definitely bring many Demon Clan s over.There might be an intense battle going on over there, and it might even be the end of it. The woman might have already been killed or captured, and the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" scroll she carried with her might also be taken away. However, if he saw it for himself, Tang Huan's heart would feel as though thousands of ants were biting him, making him feel extremely uncomfortable.Especially that place; it was only a short ten kilometers away from here.Didn't the Werewolf say that the Howling Firmament Wolf King is heavily injured and their strength plummeted? The woman has the courage to charge into the depths of the Maze Realm Forest, and her strength is definitely not weak, maybe they are already there fighting with each other? We just need to go take a look, the situation isn't right, we should leave immediately, it doesn't matter, right, Xiao Budian, what do you think? Tang Huan muttered to himself as he continued to persuade her.\"Yiya!\" Hearing that, Xiao Budian shook his head like a rattle drum.\"You mean it doesn't matter? \"Fine, I'll listen to you. Let's go over and take a look!\"Tang Huan laughed and finally made up his mind. He inserted the Fire Cloud Sword into the sword sheath on his back, supported it with his arms, and rushed up the huge boulder.\"Yiya, yiya\" Seeing this, the Xiao Budian hurriedly nodded his head. However, after nodding a few times, she seemed to have thought of something and continued to shake his head.\"Nodding and shaking your head, what do you mean?\"Tang Huan looked confused, but his footsteps were not slow at all.After a while, Tang Huan ran back to his previous hiding place and pulled out the big bag of gems, and then carried it on his shoulder and flew towards the direction Werewolf was supposed to go. On his shoulders, Xiao Budian pinched his ears, then scratched his head in anger.Of course Tang Huan understood what the Xiao Budian meant, it was just that he pretended not to know.Not long after, the Xiao Budian finally calmed down, but instead, she was squatting on Tang Huan's shoulder and sulking, teasing it not to pay attention. It did not even reply when it spoke, only her mouth was tightly shut.Tang Huan's heart also trembled along with the water ripples in its eye sockets. In the end, he took out a dozen or so gems, and only then did the little guy become cheerful once more.Along the way, they did not encounter any more wild beasts, nor did they meet any more Martial Warriors s who had entered the Maze Realm Forest.After about half an hour, Tang Huan suddenly smelled a strong stench of blood at the entrance of the valley. Following the smell, he saw a dozen or so Black Wolf s sprawled on the ground, and he even saw two Werewolf s with brown fur under a tree.A light blue horn hung from Werewolf's waist, it was obvious that she was also a Demon General of the fourth step.No matter if it was Black Wolf, Silver Wolf, or even Werewolf, they all had a hole the size of a baby's fist on their body. It was bloody, and Werewolf's wound was in their hearts, while Black Wolf's and Silver Wolf's were both in their heads.Tang Huan was secretly speechless, the person who made this move was definitely powerful, furthermore, his blood had already congealed, he should have died a long time ago.Taking a light breath, Tang Huan continued to move forward. On his shoulder, Xiao Budian also raised his head and pricked his ears up.After about a hundred metres, Tang Huan could even see a Werewolf with black fur, his body was even more sturdy than the brown Werewolf. Other than his physique, Werewolf's claws were also golden, and the sharp horn on his waist had an azure color.\"A Demon General of the fifth step!\"Tang Huan was slightly surprised, but the black Werewolf was already completely dead, a spear tip stained red with blood still protruding from her back.Seeing until here, Tang Huan suddenly realized that all of the Black Wolf s, Silver Wolf s and Werewolf s should have all been killed by this spear.Just as he was about to leave, Tang Huan suddenly realized that there seemed to be something pressing down on the black Werewolf's body. He opened the corpse and saw that it was actually a middle-aged man with a waxy yellow complexion.The middle-aged man and the black Werewolf had actually perished together!\"Why does it feel so familiar?\"Tang Huan sighed inwardly, and gently caressed the middle aged man's eyes. He couldn't help but mutter to himself, but he really couldn't remember where he had seen this middle-aged man before, perhaps this middle-aged man was also a Martial Warriors of the Furious Waves City, and had even fought with Tang Huan somewhere before.There were no corpses for several kilometers, but the marks on the ground were quite messy. After another few kilometers, the corpses began to appear one after another.Black Wolf, Silver Wolf, Brown WerewolfAlong the way, there were dozens of them. Among them, there was even the corpse of a Demon General of the fifth step like the Black Werewolf. The death of these Werewolf and wolves were even more miserable. There was a huge scar on almost all of their bodies, as if they had cut it with their blades.After nearly a hundred meters, the bodies suddenly became very dense.Within a radius of a few dozen meters, there were dozens of dead Black Wolf s and dozens of dead Silver Wolf s. There were three brown colored Werewolf s and one black colored Werewolf also appeared.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: 40Chapter 40 - Howling Firmament Wolf King\"The woman with the 'Phoenix Blood Crystal' on her body, could it be her?\"Tang Huan's heart moved, he started to size up and down. The lady was also around 40 years old, her body was covered with wounds, she was probably already dead. Beside her right side lay a thick and heavy blade.This weapon actually matched up with the wounds on the corpses.She had killed several Demon General s of the fifth step, so her strength should still be above the middle-aged man in front, but she was still outnumbered. Since she was dead, the remnants of the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" she carried should have fallen into the hands of the Demon Clan soldiers who surrounded and attacked her.Tang Huan looked at the middle aged woman and thought it was a pity. Suddenly, he frowned again, he realized that the middle-aged woman looked a little familiar.\"Yiya!\"Suddenly, Xiao Budian whispered into Tang Huan's ear.Tang Huan did not hesitate as he retreated quickly.The moment he retreated, the middle aged woman opened her eyes without any warning, she straightened her waist and grabbed onto the heavy sword, her sharp eyes landing on Tang Huan's body, but when she saw Tang Huan's face, she was startled, and blurted out: \"It's you!\"\"You know me?\"He actually didn't die? Tang Huan was initially surprised, but when the middle aged woman spoke out, her words made his expression change slightly, could it be that she was someone from the Tang Family again?In that moment, killing intent revealed itself in Tang Huan's eyes, and he gripped the sword hilt.\"Passenger ship!\"Although the middle-aged woman did not know why Tang Huan's expression changed so much, she still spat out these two words.Tang Huan was startled, two figures suddenly flashed past his mind: \"So it's you guys!\"When the middle-aged woman mentioned the word \"passenger ship,\" she finally reminded him of the middle-aged man and woman that rode on the same passenger ship as him. He didn't expect to meet them here.However, even though he recognized her, Tang Huan did not let go of the sword hilt.\"Being able to reunite with little brother here is also fate.\"The middle aged woman did not care about Tang Huan being on guard against her, and laughed, but it seemed to hit a sore spot, and her smile became uglier than crying.Immediately after, she seemed to have thought of something, and her face changed, as she anxiously asked: \"Little brother, I beg of you to help my Young Miss, Howling Firmament Wolf King is chasing after her, as long as you are willing to help, I am willing!\" Before she finished speaking, her voice suddenly stopped.Subsequently, the middle-aged woman fell to the ground stiffly and didn't move anymore.It was only then that Tang Huan realised that there was also a huge hole in her abdomen. It should have been caused by the Werewolf's claws, and the reason why she could still wake up was because he had recovered from his injuries.\"There's actually a young lady.\"Tang Huan was stunned, and suddenly remembered that on the passenger ship, there was indeed a figure sleeping on the leg of the middle aged woman, it was just that the figure was wrapped too tightly, he did not get off the boat even at noon, and could not see her face, he did not expect that the middle-aged man and woman were her attendants.Furthermore, the brown colored Werewolf had told them that they were looking for three people.Could it be that the person who possessed the 'Phoenix Blood Crystal' was the 'young miss' that the middle-aged woman had mentioned? Otherwise, why would the Howling Firmament Wolf King chase after her?\"Whoosh!\"Looking at the middle aged woman who was devoid of any signs of life, Tang Huan hesitated for a moment before continuing forward.His purpose for coming here was precisely because of that \"Divine Weapon Catalogue s\" remnant scroll. How could he stop moving at the last moment?However, in regards to the middle aged woman's request, Tang Huan was not confident at all.No matter how much that \"Howling Firmament Wolf King\" got injured, she was still one of the eight great Demon King s under the Demon Lord Fen Tian's command. She was merely a mere Stage Three Martial Disciple who had just opened nine Spiritual Meridian s.To ask him to save someone from the \"Howling Firmament Wolf King\", was this a joke?Perhaps before he could even meet that \"miss\", she had already been killed by \"Howling Firmament Wolf King\" and even the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" fragment had been snatched away.\"Awoooo \u2014\"After walking only a few kilometers forward, Tang Huan heard an incomparably resounding roar that pierced through the golden rocks, as if it could even tear apart the sky.\"Howling Firmament Wolf King?\" Just hearing this voice caused Tang Huan's heart to tremble uncontrollably.\"Yiya!\" Xiao Budian's chubby body also trembled a few times, after that she cried out in a low voice and shook her head at Tang Huan, signalling him to not go any further.\"Don't be afraid, let's go over and take a look!\"Tang Huan patted the Xiao Budian's head. Resisting the fear in his heart, he carefully moved closer.In a short while, Tang Huan saw an unusually tall and sturdy figure in the messy forest in front of him. On the body of the three-meter-tall figure was a huge, ferocious wolf head, the fur on its body was an icy blue color, and both of its arms were thicker than a person's thighs.Pieces of solid and bulging muscles appeared as if they contained explosive power. Every claw in his hands and feet were as sharp as a steel hook, and it was as if even the incomparably hard boulder could be ripped apart with a single swipe of his claw.The burly Werewolf's wrist, ankle and waist all had solid and heavy armor, and at her right claw, she was also holding a long and heavy blade. The entire blade was three meters long, the body of the blade was about a foot wide, and the back of the blade was probably two inches thick.The longblade was pitch black, and it was unknown what iron ore it was made from.Although it was not a high-grade weapon, just by its weight alone, coupled with the strength of the burly man himself, it would be able to cut through even a high-grade weapon.\"This is the Howling Firmament Wolf King!\"Tang Huan's mind went cold and he could not help but take a deep breath.But the next moment, a trace of doubt appeared in his heart. Howling Firmament Wolf King was actually gasping for breath, he could clearly hear the heavy breathing from twenty to thirty meters away, the tip of the blade in his hand was already on the ground, as though he wanted to use this as an opportunity to share the weight of the blade.Those who could be called young miss were probably not young. Although this Howling Firmament Wolf King had heavy injuries, it was actually quite taxing to deal with such a young girl.In a blink of an eye, Tang Huan's gaze quickly turned towards the Howling Firmament Wolf King.An elegant figure then entered Tang Huan's line of sight, she was indeed a very young lady, tall and graceful, with a towering chest, a round buttocks raised, and a slim waist. With just a grasp, under the black robe, her exquisite and lithe figure appeared faintly, with a unique charm.Not only was her figure hot, but her face was also extremely beautiful. Her eyebrows were like crescent moons, her eyes were like autumn water, her nose was perked up, and her cherry lips were small.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: 41Chapter 41 - Tyrant Blade, Divine Bow\"She's actually so beautiful!\"In his previous life, the network was developed and he could not count the number of different pictures of beauties. Tang Huan had also read through them many times. Therefore, when Tang Huan saw the black gowned woman, he couldn't help but be amazed.Water produced hibiscus, naturally went to carve, that was the kind of woman she spoke of.It was unknown what was going on with the young woman as she panted nonstop like the Howling Firmament Wolf King. Her perfectly round and straight chest was moving up and down rapidly and beads of sweat could be seen trickling down from her temples. Her clothes were also partially drenched by the sweat as they stuck to her delicate body.Not only that, her hands also seemed to be trembling slightly.\"Little girl, stop stubbornly resisting. If you hand over that 'Divine Weapon Catalogue' remnant scroll, I can spare your life.\" Howling Firmament Wolf King suddenly opened her mouth, the sound was like a broken bellows, hoarse and unpleasant to the ears, but her tone was extremely cold and stern, giving off a sense of oppression.\"Spare my life? But no one knows who spared who in the end! \" The black robed woman was not moved at all. Her red lips parted as she laughed, \"Howling Firmament Wolf King, if you had not been injured, I might have died a long time ago. But now, you should stop boasting like that.\"\"What big words you have there!\"The Howling Firmament Wolf King laughed sinisterly, \"Little girl, you used that Divine Weapon to shoot three arrows at this king, you have long reached your limit, this king wants to see, can you shoot a fourth arrow!\"After hearing what she said, Tang Huan's eyes went wide. The black gowned woman actually had a Divine Weapon? And it seemed to be a bow?No wonder she was able to resist the injured Howling Firmament Wolf King for so long at such a young age!The woman in front of him was really in a hurry, she actually called me, Stage Three Martial Disciple, to save a Martial Warriors with a Divine Weapon? What kind of international joke was this? Seeing that the lady was dead, Tang Huan did not curse out loud, but in his heart, he could not help but curse.\"You can give it a try!\" The woman in black sneered.\"Good!\" \"Alright!\"When the Howling Firmament Wolf King heard this, he immediately opened her bloody mouth and laughed wildly, \"Little girl, this king has killed countless human Martial Warriors s under this' Tyrant Blade '. I have even killed one Stage Nine Martial Saint, but I have never killed a human woman.\"Kill \u2014\"He raised his right arm, and the huge black blade that was over three meters long suddenly swung upwards, explosively shooting towards the black clothed female who was more than twenty meters away. A wave of killing intent that seemed as if it condensed reality swept out, and even seemed to freeze in the air.Seeing that, Tang Huan's heart shivered, and his gaze immediately turned to the girl in black.\"This Zhang Gong is her Divine Weapon?\"Tang Huan's eyes flashed with surprise, the black robed lady held the bow in his left hand, and pulled the string with his right hand. A deep blue arrow formed from the tip of his finger, quickly extended out, and in that moment, the blue arrow had already reached the bow.Tang Huan's mind was in shock, even though the arrow was aimed at the Howling Firmament Wolf King, but looking at it from afar, he felt an indescribable chill spreading out from the bottom of his heart, so much that his hands and feet were numb, as though his soul was completely absorbed by the blue arrow.Even from such a distance and with the target not being him, it was still the same. If the arrow was aimed at him, he would not be able to move, much less dodge it.\"Awoo!\"Howling Firmament Wolf King seemed to have also felt the enormous pressure. She raised her head and roared, but her movements were not slow at all as she continued to stride towards the black-robed woman. However, Tang Huan discovered that the icy-blue hair on the back of his neck was standing up, as though she was extremely nervous.From Howling Firmament Wolf King's words just now, he could tell that the black gowned woman had only been able to shoot three arrows. But now, the black gowned woman was about to shoot a fourth arrow.\"Buzz!\"Intense trembling suddenly resounded through the world. The black gowned woman suddenly released her bowstring, and the blue arrow immediately shot towards Howling Firmament Wolf King like a meteor.The surrounding space became dark without light, only leaving a blue streak of light in the air. In an instant, an incomparably terrifying aura filled the sky, causing one's heart to tremble.\"Awoo!\"Howling Firmament Wolf King roared out once again, the thick and black blade in her hand did not directly slash towards the azure arrow, but danced crazily in front of him, streaks of black blade shadows flashed in front of him, seemingly congealing into a wide and thick curtain of blades, quickly pushing forward.In a split-second, the deep blue arrow collided with the dark shadow of the blade.\"Boom!\"The moment the two collided, the azure arrow actually exploded crazily, instantly turning into countless azure fragments that filled the sky, like a rain of flowers. It passed through the dark black shadows of the blade, and struck Howling Firmament Wolf King with lightning speed.\"Aoouuu ~ ~ ~\"Amidst the blood-curdling screams, Howling Firmament Wolf King's sturdy body actually flew out backwards, and landed heavily over ten meters away. Fresh blood spewed out of her mouth, and the extremely heavy Tyrant Blade broke away from the claws, flying twenty to thirty meters away and piercing into the trunk of a large tree.Tang Huan, who was still immersed in the terrifying arrow, suddenly woke up. He quietly rolled over with Xiao Budian in his arms, and hid behind another thick tree trunk.\"Howling Firmament Wolf King, how does this' Dazzling Spring of Ten Thousand Flowers' taste?\"The woman in black suddenly gasped for breath as she laughed, her clear and melodious voice trembling.Tang Huan stuck his head out from behind the tree once again, and when he looked up, the black gowned woman was holding her blue bow which had a beautiful yet strange appearance.After the arrow, her body was already drenched in sweat. Her black robe was completely drenched in sweat, and it stuck to her voluptuous body. She was convex to begin with, and her voluptuous and sexy body was revealed, revealing a strong allure that captivated the mind.\"Huh?\"Suddenly, Tang Huan gasped in his heart, the tip of his eyebrows raised slightly. He suddenly realized that, at the right palm of the black gowned woman that was at the side of his leg, there was blood dripping down his long and slender fingers continuously. Her body was also shaking slightly, as though he could fall to the ground at any time.Seeing this scene, Tang Huan immediately understood. After firing the fourth arrow, the black gowned woman was already exhausted of his strength.

Howling Firmament Wolf King who was lying on the ground struggled for a few moments before shakily getting up. Her head, neck, chest and four limbs were all badly mutilated and dripping with blood.\"You, you!\"Seeing this scene, the black robed lady's body swayed, and her expression changed. It was clear that she did not expect Howling Firmament Wolf King to be able to stand up again.\"Little girl, This King will not die yet!\"\"Don't worry, I won't let you die that easily. If I don't enjoy such a beautiful human girl, wouldn't it be a pity to kill her? \"Little girl, I'm sure you're still an infant. Very soon, you'll know the benefits of this king. When you're in your happiest moments, I'll let you enter my stomach again. Cough \u2026 cough \u2026\"\"Pfft!\"\"Little girl, don't be in such a hurry. This King will be coming over soon.\"When Howling Firmament Wolf King saw this, the lustful look in her eyes became even more intense. \"You have shot a total of four arrows at this king just now, this king will return them back to you in double, so you can have a taste of this king's thick and strong arrows before you die!\" Saying that, Howling Firmament Wolf King straightened her back intentionally.\"I never thought that there would be such a shameless person like you under the Demon Lord Fen Tian.\"However, right now, let alone escaping, she couldn't even kill herself. She could only watch as Howling Firmament Wolf King spoke obscenely while getting closer to her. She couldn't help but have a sorrowful look in her eyes.This king is a Demon Clan, and in your eyes, isn't that how the Demon Clan acts? Haha, haha! \"The Howling Firmament Wolf King heard and laughed, after stabilizing her swaying body, she immediately took a few steps back, leaving the black gowned woman only a few meters away.\"\u2026\"The woman in black bit her lips and didn't say another word. Her delicate body trembled and her face became even paler.Although she was tall and slender, compared to the tall and sturdy body of the Howling Firmament Wolf King, she was like a small witch meeting a Great Witch. The current her was like a small sheep that was shivering under the pressure of the big bad wolf.Soon, the distance between them narrowed once more.\"Girl, it's time to enjoy yourself. Quickly come into This King's embrace!\"Howling Firmament Wolf King laughed obscenely, extending her scarlet tongue and licking her lips, saliva constantly dripping, while his bloody claws already slowly grabbed over.The woman in black knew that it would be hard for her to survive so she closed her eyes in despair. But in the next moment, she seemed to have thought of something and her eyelids fluttered open.\"Hmm?\"Seeing the sudden change in the black gowned woman's expression, Howling Firmament Wolf King was startled, a bad feeling emerging in his heart.However, before he could even figure out where this feeling came from, a figure suddenly jumped up from behind him. \"Old pervert, if you want to enjoy such a beautiful girl, it should be me doing so.This person was naturally Tang Huan.In the split second that the voice was heard, Tang Huan slammed his palms down onto Howling Firmament Wolf King's gigantic wolf head. His skin and hair were violently burnt and strange sizzling sounds immediately came out, while a pungent smell of burnt flesh pervaded the air.\"Aooo!\"The Howling Firmament Wolf King screamed. At the same time that her body fell backwards, her sharp right claw had also reached behind him.Tang Huan succeeded in his first strike, and he immediately jumped away.This Howling Firmament Wolf King was after all one of the eight great Demon King s of the Demon Clan. A skinny camel was bigger than a horse, and although he looked like she would fall down at any time, even if the dog was in a rush, it could jump over the wall. Who knew if he would suddenly unleash an extremely ferocious attack after being attacked.If he was careless and the Howling Firmament Wolf King caused him to live for half his life, then it wouldn't be worth it.If he did not jump out of the way early, that claw would have been enough to break his tendons and break his bones.\"Despicable humans, how dare you sneak attack This King!\" Howling Firmament Wolf King forced herself to turn over and lie down on the ground as she roared out in anger.\"You dirty old man, not only will I sneak attack you, I will kill you!\"Tang Huan sneered, and with a clang, he took out his Fire Cloud Sword, and hacked over like a Howling Firmament Wolf King. When he brandished the sword, not only did Tang Huan activate the Genuine Qi, he even integrated it with the Power of True Fire. The blazing aura spread out from the sword, causing the temperature of the small area to suddenly rise.\"Weapon Refiner?\"Howling Firmament Wolf King waved her arm with all her might and used the armor on her wrist to block.But right at this moment, Tang Huan's wrist trembled, the sword force suddenly changed, and in the instant that he swung his arm, the Fire Cloud Sword had also pierced through his throat like lightning.This was Werewolf's vital point, and it was far from being as hard as his chest and four limbs. Adding to the fact that Howling Firmament Wolf King was also at the end of her strength, the sharp and hot sword tip drilled into his neck immediately.\"Aooo!\"Howling Firmament Wolf King opened her mouth wide, looking very fierce, she screamed out in extreme pain, and then used one claw to grab onto the tip of the sword at the back of her neck, while the other clawed at the sword in front of him. Her large eyes stared straight at Tang Huan, and finally stood up shakily.\"Bang!\" In a blink of an eye, the Fire Cloud Sword was broken apart.The Howling Firmament Wolf King raised her arms, wanting to throw the broken sword towards Tang Huan, but before the broken sword left her hands, he fell to the ground. After wiggling for a few moments, he stopped moving, her eyes were still wide open.\"Hu!\"Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief, and a heavy burden fell from his heart.Although he had chosen to attack just now, his heartstrings were extremely taut. He could not help but feel nervous. After all, the difference in their cultivation levels was too great. Fortunately, Howling Firmament Wolf King, who had not recovered from her injuries in the first place, was severely injured by the black gowned woman once again.Now that the Howling Firmament Wolf King was dead, the string in Tang Huan's heart had finally relaxed.However, when he looked at the broken sword in the Howling Firmament Wolf King's hand, he couldn't help but feel some pain in his heart. His first graded weapon had been destroyed just like that.\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian came out from the bush not far away. His two legs quickly ran around, and he quickly arrived in front of Tang Huan, jumping onto his shoulder.\"Miss!\"Touching its head, Tang Huan turned to look, but at first glance, he did not see the black gowned woman's figure. Both of his eyes swept down and realized that she was also lying on the ground, similarly not moving at all.\"Fainted?\"Tang Huan strode over quickly, not feeling surprised at all. The black-robed woman had long since exhausted all of his strength, and it was already a miracle that he could stay unconscious until after he appeared.What he did not know was that the black gowned woman did not pass out because of exhaustion, but had fainted because of what he had said to the Howling Firmament Wolf King when he made her move.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: 43Chapter 43 - Unthinkable\"Xiao Budian, you've found a good place.\"\"Yiya, yiya.\"After a long while, in a concealed cave several kilometers away, Tang Huan first placed the black-robed woman who was carrying a piece of huge rock on his left shoulder onto it. Then, he carefully removed the precious bag wrapped around the black longblade.The weight of Howling Firmament Wolf King's weapon had greatly exceeded Tang Huan's expectations. According to his estimations, the weight of the blade should have already exceeded two hundred kilograms.Only Tang Huan was now a Stage Three Martial Disciple, if not, it would be impossible for him to walk this far while carrying a hundred kilogram woman and a hundred kilogram long blade, let alone the hundred kilogram precious stones on the bag he carried with the back of the blade.What iron ore did this Tyrant Blade use to forge it?However, there was one point that Tang Huan was sure of, which was that this blade definitely did not use the \"black profound iron\" that he used to forge the Fire Cloud Sword. Otherwise, it would not have been so heavy.Tang Huan planned to bring the Tyrant Blade back, and after it melted, he would forge a few new weapons. His Fire Cloud Sword was damaged by the Howling Firmament Wolf King, no matter what, he had to find a way to make it back up. Of course, it was a good thing that the Tyrant Blade was not a graded weapon. If it had fused with the gem before, then it could not be forged again.Letting out a long breath, Tang Huan looked at the black robed lady on the stone in the blink of an eye and felt a headache coming.In the depths of Maze Realm Forest, it was impossible for Tang Huan to carry her anywhere. The problem now was that he didn't know when this woman would wake up. Even if he did, it was still unknown whether he would be able to recover quickly.He had already been out for more than twenty days. In another month or so, he would be in the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" that Senior Mu Kui had mentioned.He had to participate in the competition. The better his ranking was, the greater his fame would be. This way, there would be even more people looking for him to forge weapons. Not only would it increase his refining strength, it would also be possible for him to see all kinds of rare gems.To the Weapon Refiner, this was a virtuous circle.Before the competition, the more time Tang Huan spent on forging weapons, the better.But if this black gowned woman was unable to wake up after being unconscious for more than ten days, then Tang Huan really wanted to cry. Of course, if he was someone who did not care what methods he used, he could immediately take away the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" fragment from her body, leaving her here to fend for herself.Unfortunately, this was something that Tang Huan couldn't do no matter how hard he tried.\"Let's wait first, and see what happens next. If we really can't, then we can only carry her out of the Maze Realm Forest.\" Tang Huan made up his mind. He took out a few \"illumination stones\" from his bag that were especially bright. The bright white light immediately illuminated the cave within a few meters radius, making it as bright as day.Fortunately, the entrance of the cave was covered with thick vines, so there was no need to worry about the light seeping out.This cave was most likely the lair of the wolves. There was dry wolf dung in the corner of the cave, and there was even a fishy smell in the air. Luckily, it was not too heavy and was tolerable.\"Hot, hot!\"Just as Tang Huan was looking at the cave, the woman in black suddenly moaned.Tang Huan was startled, he subconsciously touched the black gowned woman's smooth forehead, it was so hot that it would burn his hands.\"It can't be. It's just the exhaustion of its energy. Why is it still burning?\"Tang Huan was immediately dumbfounded. This world was not like his previous world, there was no ibuprofen, nor was there any peace.\"Eh, it doesn't seem to be a fever?\"After looking more carefully, Tang Huan suddenly realized that something was wrong. Not only was the woman's face flushed red, his originally white neck and hands had also turned bright red.Tang Huan could not see his other parts, but he guessed that it was the same situation.It was unknown what caused her to turn into such a state? Howling Firmament Wolf King had never touched her before? Could it be that she suffered a backlash from overusing the Divine Weapon?Right, where did she hide her longbow?When Tang Huan carried her, he didn't feel that she had a weapon on her body at all.\"So hot!\"The woman in black moaned once again.Her left hand lightly tore at the lapel of her clothes as her two beautiful eyebrows tightly knitted together. Beads of sweat the size of beans seeped out of her pores, and her black robes, which had just dried up a moment ago, were once again soaked in sweat.Tang Huan was not in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery before him, and his brows knitted even more.\"What should we do?\"Muttering, Tang Huan couldn't help but touch the girl's forehead, and was shocked. The temperature had increased even more, her body seemed to have turned into a furnace, inside it were blazing flames.If this went on, before this woman could wake up, she would most likely be burned to death by the intense heat in her body.Tang Huan was at a loss for what to do, but at this time, he suddenly realised that the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" within the Dantian, was slowly spinning, following that, strands of heat seemed to flow through his fingers and into his palm, following the Spiritual Meridian all the way up into the cauldron.\"Hmm?\"Tang Huan was shocked, his finger subconsciously leaving the woman's forehead. However, inside the Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was still spinning, and the heat that was entering it was slowly merging with his own Genuine Qi, making her Genuine Qi increase by a tiny bit.\"What's the situation?\"Tang Huan was dumbstruck. If the cauldron was not still spinning, he would have thought that he was hallucinating.The heat emitted from the woman's body was actually absorbed and refined by the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", and then transformed into his own Genuine Qi.Was there such an unbelievable thing in the world?After a long while, Tang Huan finally snapped back to reality. He discovered that Xiao Budian had actually jumped to the edge of the gigantic boulder and was staring straight ahead with his pair of deep blue eyes that seemed to be somewhat confused.\"Xiao Budian, what are you looking at?\"Tang Huan was a little surprised, and followed his gaze. In the next moment, Tang Huan almost popped out his eyes as he looked at the boulder. The woman's jade body was already exposed, and the black robe was completely torn apart, even most of her undergarments had been ripped off.Even so, the girl's warmth did not weaken at all, her entire person was like a fish out of a pond. Her silky skin was covered in sweat, and her delicate body was twisting back and forth like a water snake.Tang Huan never thought that what he saw would actually be such a scenery and couldn't help but gasp; even his heart seemed to have skipped a beat.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: 44Chapter 44 - Healing\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian looked at Tang Huan who was in a daze, then at the woman who was gasping for breath and feeling extreme pain on the boulder. Her eyes were filled with confusion, as she did not understand what the two were doing.Tang Huan suddenly woke up from his stupor. \"Xiao Budian, hurry and go outside.The black gowned woman's snort was getting louder and louder, you better not provoke any strong beasts or Demon Clan soldiers over.\"Yiya!\"The little guy nodded and ran out.Tang Huan immediately grabbed onto the black robe, and covered her extremely alluring and alluring body up. At this time, her entire body that was as smooth and smooth as creamy turned bright red, his skin was extremely hot.\"Hot!\"The black-clothed woman let out a charming cry, and once again pulled away her clothes.Tang Huan really did not have any thoughts of taking advantage of her, but once he covered the top, she kicked the bottom, covering the bottom, and the top also fell down.For a moment, Tang Huan was in a mess. Not long later, he was covered in sweat.\"If you want to talk, then go ahead. It's not like I'm at a disadvantage anyway.\"After a minute or two, Tang Huan completely gave up on his original plan and allowed the woman to take off all of her clothes. And in this short period of time, the temperature of her body seemed to have increased once again.Feeling the scorching heat emitted from her body, Tang Huan once again thought of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" in the Dantian, and his heart was slightly moved.\"I don't care that much. I'll just die trying. If that's the case, then I can't either. Don't blame me when I die!\"Tang Huan took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and tightly held onto the woman's burning hot left hand. Then, he activated \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art,\" causing the speed of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" to immediately increase, and two streams of heat flowed continuously from the Spiritual Meridian on Tang Huan's arms into the Dantian's cauldron.Tang Huan's absorption of the heat was not slow, but the woman's condition did not seem to be relieved at all, his delicate body continued to writhe in pain.\"I have to find the source of the heat!\"Tang Huan frowned, his thoughts running fast.He had already activated the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" to its limit, and within the Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was also rotating at an unprecedented speed. However, the woman only had this much heat inside her body, it was like a pipe, no matter how fast the water was, the water that flowed through the pipe would only be so great.As he thought about it, Tang Huan's palms landed on the woman's forehead and slid down her cheeks.After a while, his hand had already slipped past his neck and climbed up the two perfectly round peaks. The sexy and wonderful feeling made Tang Huan's heart throb, but he immediately calmed himself down and continued to walk downstream. Not long later, he reached the girl's flat stomach that did not have the slightest bit of fat on it.Just then, two streams of heat that were several times stronger than before suddenly rose and rushed into Tang Huan's palms.\"It's actually in her Dantian!\"was startled, the Dantian was the most important place in the Martial Warriors, and normally speaking, this place would not have any problems. For example, if there was something wrong with the Dantian, how could this woman possess such a powerful strength that could rival the Howling Firmament Wolf King?But what Tang Huan did not expect was that the problem with this woman was precisely the Dantian!Even though there was a layer of her stomach, Tang Huan could clearly feel the heat emitted from her Dantian. It was as if a fireball was hidden inside, extremely condensed, and continuously released heat, which then spread through her limbs and bones, and her internal organs.What was going on?Tang Huan's heart was filled with suspicions, but the current situation was dangerous, he did not have much time to think, immediately jumping onto the huge rock, directly sitting cross-legged next to the lady, with his hands pressed tightly against her lower abdomen. Following the continuous circulation of the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\", more and more heat rushed into the pill furnace.Time passed bit by bit. The wriggling of the woman finally began to lessen, and the moans of pain also became quieter and quieter.\"Yiya?\"At the entrance of the cave, the Xiao Budian gently pulled open the vines, and with a glance at the two on the rock, she called out to them. Seeing that Tang Huan did not respond, his eyes revealed a look of confusion.Xiao Budian finally came back to her senses after looking around continuously three times.There was still some warmth left in the woman's body, but it had greatly improved compared to before. However, although the girl's situation had improved a lot, Tang Huan still felt very uncomfortable.Holding only the woman's palm, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" still had time to refine the heat, but after moving both hands to the woman's abdomen, the speed at which the heat flowed into her body far exceeded the speed at which she could refine it. Unknowingly, the heat gathering within the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" became more and more intense.At this moment, Tang Huan felt that if he were to continue down the sucking, it would probably explode.\"The Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art is a little out of date.\"Tang Huan secretly sighed, seeing that the lady's condition had improved, he decisively retracted his palms. He understood in his heart that the reason why the refining speed was slow was extremely important to the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\". The better the technique, the faster the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" would turn and the faster the refinement would speed up.Conversely, it is the same.Tang Huan took a deep breath, suppressed his emotions and continued to refine the heat from the cauldron. Following the rotation of the cauldron, not only did the heat wave fuse with the Genuine Qi, it was also slowly being absorbed by the lump of True Fire.\"Yes.\"After an unknown amount of time, a lovely snort suddenly sounded from the cave.The woman bewilderedly opened her eyes, her gaze slowly turning. The statue-like figure sitting cross-legged on the riverbank was immediately imprinted into her eyes. The girl seemed to have thought of something and sat up straight. She then realized that her black robe had fallen off and her beautiful face was flushed red.Embarrassed, angry, sad, remorsefulThe woman's delicate body trembled slightly as all sorts of emotions surged from the bottom of her heart. Two streams of tears fell from the corners of her eyes like broken pearls, she suddenly gritted her teeth, and that bizarre and beautiful blue longbow appeared in her hands as she fiercely swept it towards Tang Huan's neck.But just as the tiny, transparent bowstring was about to touch Tang Huan's neck, the longbow suddenly stopped in mid-air.Her arms uncontrollably drooped down slowly, but not long later, she pursed her red lips tightly. With a raise of her arms, the blue longbow's bowstring once again appeared at the side of Tang Huan's neck. With just a slight force, it seemed like she could cut Tang Huan's neck off.However, the woman's arms were trembling. It was clear that she was still hesitating.After a long while, the woman seemed to have finally made up her mind. However, just as she was about to withdraw her arm, anxious \"yiyaya\" sounds suddenly echoed in the cave.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: 45I have already repaid you!Tang Huan suddenly woke up from his stupor and saw the Xiao Budian running towards him anxiously. His pair of deep blue eyes were filled with panic as his two little front paws were gesticulating at him nonstop.\"Hmm?\"Seeing that, Tang Huan turned his head, and immediately saw the half bow that was placed on the side of his neck, he could not help but be shocked, and immediately remembered the black gowned woman's blue bow that was out of sight.Tang Huan's forehead was drenched in sweat, but after thinking about it, he had a faint guess of what was going on. He calmed down immediately, slowly turning his body, looking at the lady with a bitter smile: \"Miss, are you repaying your life's benefactor like this?\"\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian climbed up Tang Huan's shoulders and glared at the lady in front of him furiously.Seeing the little fellow, the lady's eyes flashed with a strange light. The blue bow that she had planned to put away instead moved closer to Tang Huan's neck, her beautiful face had a frosty look, and her tone ice-cold: \"That's right, you saved my life, but you also tainted my clean body, how can I keep you?\"\"Filthy?\"Tang Huan scoffed, and said with amusement and annoyance, \"Girl, please inspect it yourself, and see if the thing below you is broken.\"\"You!\"Hearing Tang Huan speak in such a blatant manner, the woman was immediately filled with shame and anger. Her face was completely red, and his full and tender breasts were trembling as he moved up and down rapidly, while the blue bowstring in her hand even touched the skin on Tang Huan's neck. However, in the next moment, the woman's face froze.Of course she couldn't inspect the body in front of him like Tang Huan had said, but she could feel that there wasn't anything strange between her legs.'Could it be that he really didn't have any? 'Before this, the reason why she suddenly fainted was because of Tang Huan's sneak attack on Howling Firmament Wolf King. She thought that the person who came was her savior, but upon hearing the man's explanation, she realized that she had entered the tiger's den after escaping from the wolf's mouth.When she woke up, she found that her appearance was unbearable. She subconsciously thought that she had been tainted by this man.He had originally planned to take his life immediately, but after thinking back to how the other party had saved him from the Howling Firmament Wolf King, he was still unable to repay the kindness with enmity.\"Even if you don't have that, you're not a good person either!\" The woman gritted her teeth as she pondered.\"You mean clothes?\"Tang Huan pointed to the woman's chest, and started admiring her beauty, and then laughed out loud, \"If I'm not wrong, it seems like someone was burning with passion, and pulled himself out completely in the end. I'll cover her once, she'll lift it again, cover it again, and she'll lift it again.\"\"You!\"The lady became angry from embarrassment, and before she could finish speaking, she saw the look in Tang Huan's eyes. Only then did she realize that her clothes were open, and she screamed in fright, and immediately grabbed hold of the black robe, covering her exposed chest. When she looked at Tang Huan again, her beautiful face was flushed red with embarrassment, as though she was about to bleed.When she thought about how not only had she been seen while she was unconscious, but her body was still naked when she woke up, the woman in black had the urge to smash apart that smiling face with a single punch.It took a long time before the woman in black calmed down a bit.She was not completely unaware of the situation before she woke up.That scorching heat made her feel as if her whole body was about to explode. Even after she woke up, the pain was still fresh in her mind.She was very clear why such a situation had occurred and she did not doubt Tang Huan's words.However, what she was puzzled about was how this young man, who still looked somewhat young and immature, had managed to save her. Actually, when she was fighting against the Howling Firmament Wolf King with her bow and arrow, she had already mentally prepared for that.\"You, how did you make the heat in my body dissipate?\"After a moment of hesitation, the woman finally couldn't help but bite her lips as she asked softly. The blue bow in her hand finally slipped and disappeared into her sleeve.\"Yiya!\" \"Yiya!\"Seeing that, the Xiao Budian calmed down, but his clear bird cry was filled with anger.Tang Huan's gaze was fixated on the woman's right hand.The blue longbow disappeared without a sound once again. There was such a big bow hidden in the woman's sleeve, but it didn't bulge at all. Furthermore, when he carried her into the cave, he pinched her right arm. There was no weapon inside.Could it be that the bow had entered her body?Tang Huan felt that this was unbelievable.Being fiercely stared at by him like this, the woman's right hand quietly retreated into her sleeve as she embarrassedly snorted.Tang Huan regained his senses and laughed out loud: \"You don't need to know about this, I naturally have my own ways, you only need to know that I saved you twice before.\"\"Now that you have awoken, it's time for me to leave the Maze Realm Forest. Go wherever you want to go.\"Tang Huan stood up and jumped down from the boulder, \"Xiao Budian, let's go!\" When his voice fell, Tang Huan had already grabbed Howling Firmament Wolf King's Tyrant Blade.He had originally wanted to borrow the woman's \"Divine Weapon Catalogue s\" to broaden his horizons, but after she had ripped off the clothes, Tang Huan did not find anything that looked like \"Divine Weapon Catalogue s,\" nor anything that looked like \"Phoenix Blood Crystal s.\" Presumably, the Howling Firmament Wolf King's judgement was wrong.Since that was the case, Tang Huan did not wish to stay any longer.In any case, this person had already been saved, and he had already done his best. Moreover, this woman, with her elusive blue longbow, as long as she did not come across a strong Demon Clan like Howling Firmament Wolf King, she would be able to walk unhindered in Maze Realm Forest. However, with her strength, she was actually able to cause the deaths of two of her followers, it was rather strange, but there must be some other secret, Tang Huan was not interested in delving too deeply into the private matters of others.\"Yiya.\" Xiao Budian also did not bother with the girl anymore as she let out a cheerful voice.\"Wait.\"When the woman saw him, she immediately called Tang Huan back. Her voice was tender and sweet, \"I am Shan Shan, the mountain in the mountains and rivers, the coral in the mountains. What is your name?\"\"Shan Shan? As for my name, it doesn't matter if you know it or not. After this separation, we won't have a chance to meet again. \" Tang Huan laughed, holding the \"Light Stone\" that was used to illuminate the light in his hand, raising his blade up, he picked up the bag and carried it on his shoulder.\"That won't do. You have saved my life twice. How can I not repay you?\" Shan Shan slipped down from the boulder, revealing her two slender and beautiful legs from under the black robe. Although she quickly covered it up again, her face couldn't help but flush red, becoming more and more beautiful.\"Repay?\" \"No need, you've already returned the favor!\"Tang Huan gave a mysterious smile as he separated the dense vines and walked out. As the vines closed up, the cave immediately became pitch black.\"Has he already returned the favor?\"Shan Shan froze for a moment, then suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something, and her delicate and pretty face suddenly turned fiery hot in the darkness. Soon after, there were soft rustling sounds coming from the cave, and when she walked out of the cave, she had already put on her clothes.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: 46Chapter 46 - Accompanying the United StatesAlthough he had suffered a little shock at the very end, the time he had spent in there was completely worth it for Tang Huan.After completely absorbing all the heat energy from the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", the Spiritual Wheel was already in its initial stages in Tang Huan's Dantian. Not only that, the \"True Fire\" fire seed within the cauldron had actually shrunk by almost half, but the heat it contained had not decreased in the slightest and had instead increased.The \"repayment has already been repaid\" Tang Huan had just mentioned was precisely this!After opening the nine Spiritual Meridian s, it had only been a day or so since then before the Spiritual Wheel appeared. With such speed, even Tang Huan himself was shocked by it.This also caused Tang Huan to become even more curious towards the source of the heat that was produced within the woman's Dantian.If it was a woman with a weaker strength, Tang Huan might try to get along with her a little longer and see if he could find a chance to absorb a little more heat to cultivate.This way, it wouldn't be long before he can completely condense a first stage Spiritual Wheel and become a Stage Four Martial Master.However, Tang Huan did not dare to easily offend this woman called Shan Shan.Her own frightening strength caused Tang Huan to feel deep fear. In addition, her origins also made Tang Huan not want to interact too much with them. How could a person who possessed a Divine Weapon have a normal background?Even though Tang Huan was drooling in envy of her Divine Weapon, he didn't want to get involved with her any more.Tang Huan collected his emotions and walked through the forest with heavy footsteps.He also wanted to fly out of the Maze Realm Forest as fast as possible, but with the weight of 300 jin on his shoulders, being able to walk normally was already very impressive.\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian who was riding on Tang Huan's neck, suddenly grabbed Tang Huan's ears and shouted.Tang Huan unconsciously turned his head around and saw that the black gowned woman called Shan Shan had actually caught up with him. He could not help but ask, \"Miss Shan Shan, didn't I say that you do not need to repay me?\"\"If you say no, then no. Who do you think you are?\" Shan Shan's beautiful face tensed up, and she snorted out once, her eyebrows filled with shame and anger.\"You!\"Tang Huan was so angry that he didn't feel like talking to her anymore, \"Alright, if you want to follow, then follow me.\" After he finished speaking, Tang Huan continued to move forward.\"Hey, do you know which direction the Howling Firmament Wolf King and those Werewolf came from?\"Not long later, Shan Shan's clear voice came from behind.Tang Huan initially did not want to reply, but upon thinking about the tragic death of the middle-aged man and woman, he immediately understood the purpose of Shan Shan's question. His heart softened, and after looking around for a moment, he quickly adjusted his direction, and before long, he arrived at the place where the middle aged woman died.One day and one night passed, and the surrounding corpses did not suffer from any damage. It was probably because of the Werewolf's aura that the surrounding wild beasts did not dare to approach.\"Aunt Wang!\"With a tragic cry, Shan Shan's eyes turned red, she quickly rushed past Tang Huan's body and threw herself onto the middle aged woman's body, and started to sob uncontrollably.Tang Huan sighed in his heart, he then put down the bag and stabbed the black broadsword into the ground, digging a pit.When Tang Huan left that intense battle zone, it had already been almost two hours.The middle-aged woman and man that Shan Shan called \"Aunt Wang\" and \"Uncle Huang\" were buried in the ground. However, she still had not recovered from his sadness and silently followed behind Tang Huan. His eyes were swollen like walnuts, and even though he was trying his best to endure it, tears still rolled down his face from time to time.\"If you really want to repay me, then help me carry this bag!\" Tang Huan suddenly stopped in his tracks, raised his long blade, and threw the huge package at Shan Shan.\"Huh?\"Shan Shan woke up from his stupor and just as she was about to extend her hand to catch it, she seemed to have thought of something and quickly jumped backwards.\"Hey, where did you find so many gems?\"Shan Shan was only slightly surprised, but did not think that those gems were anything to be surprised about.In the instant that the package landed, Tang Huan felt as if his heart was struck ruthlessly by a hammer. He did not pay attention to Shan Shan's question, and instead said with a wry smile: \"Miss Shan Shan, you are not, are you? A powerful being that could even contend against the Howling Firmament Wolf King actually did not dare to accept this one hundred jin item? \"\"I \u2026 I don't have a Genuine Qi now?\" Shan Shan mumbled before his face became red.\"No Genuine Qi? You mean, you're no different from an ordinary person now? \" Tang Huan was stunned, Shan Shan's answer was completely out of his expectations. The fact that she lost the Genuine Qi, was it due to the side effects of using Divine Weapon, or was it due to the heat inside the Dantian?\"That's right.\" The corner of Shan Shan's mouth revealed a hint of bitterness.\"Sorry, I was too rash.\"Tang Huan helplessly patted his head. He had originally wanted to give her a bag to carry so that she would shift her attention, but he didn't expect her to almost do such a good deed. Luckily she reacted quickly and didn't use his hands to catch it.After a while, he packed his bag and returned to the road.Knowing Shan Shan's current situation, Tang Huan did not say anymore words about going her own way, and had tacitly allowed her to stay by her side. Although she had the Divine Weapon, if she did not bring out her strength, she would not be able to walk out of the Maze Realm Forest alive by herself.\"Hey, you've already said that I have already repaid you. What exactly do you mean by that?\"\"It's nothing. Also, I'm not called 'Hey'.\"\"If you don't tell me your name, I can only call you that.\"\"Alright, my name is Tang Huan!\"\"\u2026\"and Shan Shan finally walked out of the Maze Realm Forest after spending seven or eight days.Two days ago, Tang Huan robbed a few Stage Three Martial Disciple s and stole all their tents.When Tang Huan stepped onto the road that led to the Crescent City at the edge of the forest, the Tyrant Blade had already been wrapped up by the tent layer after layer, and the bundle wrapped in precious stones had also become thicker by layer. Tang Huan even made a simple cloth bag for the Xiao Budian to hide in, and then let it fall onto his shoulders.Xiao Budian was a Spiritual Beast. If a Spiritual Beast were to reveal its location, it would probably cause countless people to fight over it.If he did not conceal it well, not to mention encountering the Martial Lord and the Great Martial Master, even a few Martial Master s, Tang Huan could very well die without a burial ground.At the same time, Shan Shan also covered up her beautiful face, making her body obese.When Tang Huan and Shan Shan entered the Crescent City, at the end of the road, a young man with a rather feminine face suddenly ran out.\"Ghost!\" \"Ghost!\"The young man screamed hysterically. His extreme fear made his eyes seem like they were about to pop out of their sockets, and his face had become twisted and fierce. He ran forward with all his might without looking back, as if he wanted to grow a pair of wings and instantly fly into Crescent City.Not long after his figure disappeared, a fat figure appeared like a ghost at the end of the road. He slowly paced around and grumbled with dissatisfaction: \"I'm just a little round, how do I look like a ghost?\"In addition, this book is currently on the monthly ticket rankings, so my friends should have one or two more monthly tickets.

    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: 47Chapter 47 - Heart Flame Stone\"What?\" Tang Huan is back? \"Furious Waves City. In a courtyard in Tang Family, Tang Tianshi found it hard to believe her ears as she looked at the young man in front of him in a daze.\"What happened to Tang Tao, Tang Jie and the rest of the five? The five Stage Three Martial Disciple s were actually unable to keep that little bastard, the rice bucket! All of them are useless! \"After a while, Tang Tianshi came back to reality and roared at the top of his lungs.\"Second Master, it's possible that Tang Tao and the rest didn't run into him at all, which is why they allowed him to return alive. After all, the Maze Realm Forest is so big, and it won't be that easy for Tang Huan to find him by burrowing into the forest.\"The young man sneaked a glance at Tang Tianshi and braced himself to explain.Amongst the five Tang Family s heading to Origin Continent, the one called Tang Jie was his brother.When he did not explain, Tang Tianshi became even more furious: \"Maze Realm Forest is so big, but with Tang Huan's little strength, he can only wander around the border area. It's understandable that he could not find him for a day or two, but for even a month? What a bunch of trash! \"\"Where's the Lin Peng that sister-in-law sent? He seems to have been at Stage Four Martial Master for a long time, and even after so long, he still did not manage to find that little bastard? \" After circling the courtyard a few times, Tang Tianshi seemed to have thought of something and suddenly stopped, looking at the young man.\"Lin Peng has actually returned, and is sitting on the same ship as Tang Huan.\" As he said this, the young man's expression suddenly became strange.\"Hmm?\" Tang Tianshi was startled.\"He has already become crazy, it seems like he encountered something extremely terrifying in the Maze Realm Forest.\"\"\u2026\"\"I'm finally back!\"In the evening, at the north of Furious Waves City, in the courtyard behind the blacksmith shop, Tang Huan cheered. He first carefully put down the precious stone bundle, then directly threw the heavy Tyrant Blade on the ground and rushed to the side of the well in large strides.\"Yiya!\"Xiao Budian, who had been holding it in for an entire day, came out from her cloth bag, jumped down to shake off the water droplets on her body, and started running around in the courtyard while letting out crisp and tender cries.Shan Shan quietly walked in and leaned on the courtyard door as a trace of doubt flashed past her eyes.After travelling with her for a few days, she had already known that Tang Huan was only sixteen years old, three years younger than her. His face did indeed show this, but his actions were not childish.But in the next moment, she realized that her feeling was wrong. At some point in time, Tang Huan was indeed no different than a sixteen year old.\"Tang Huan!\"Shan Shan's beautiful face turned red, and she couldn't help but yell in embarrassment. Tang Huan, who was by the well, had actually stripped him clean.\"Why are you here?\"Hearing movement, Tang Huan turned around in surprise.Once he was at the Furious Waves City, Shan Shan suddenly disappeared. Tang Huan only thought that she had left, although he silently criticised her for leaving without saying anything, he did not take it to heart, but he did not expect her to follow him all the way here. \"Didn't you leave already, why did you come back?\"\"You, you, quickly turn back!\"Shan Shan immediately covered her eyes, her cheeks were burning hot, her heart racing. That bastard, she actually turned around.\"A few days ago, you were seen by me, and now you see me, so we're even.\" Tang Huan teased and laughed, but still turned back.\"Tang Huan, why don't you go and die?\" Shan Shan clenched her teeth and pouted.\"\u2026\"The night was dark and the blacksmith shop was brightly lit. Tang Huan placed Howling Firmament Wolf King's \"Tyrant Blade\" on the iron table. This huge heavy and heavy blade had already been carefully cleaned by him several times.This made Tang Huan feel even more that the materials used to forge this \"Tyrant Blade\" were extraordinary.\"What he is thinking about right now is how to melt it and forge himself a low-grade weapon.\" Although the Tyrant Blade was powerful, it was not suitable to be revealed in front of others. It was the weapon of the Howling Firmament Wolf King, if the Demon Clan knew that he had killed it, she would immediately become public enemy of the Demon Clan.\"Tang Huan, don't waste your energy. Howling Firmament Wolf King's' Tyrant Blade 'was forged using' Black Jade Crystal Iron '.A clear voice suddenly rang out, and Shan Shan gracefully walked over.In the evening, after bathing, she had changed into a brand-new black robe. Her delicate figure was curvaceous and curvaceous, with exquisite curves. Her creamy, snow-white, soft and smooth face was suffused with a sparkling luster, causing her already beautiful face to appear all the more alluring and alluring.\"Black Jade Crystal Iron? What is that thing? \" Tang Huan said in a daze.\"You don't even know the 'Black Jade Crystal Iron'? are you really a low level Weapon Refiner? \" Shan Shan came to Tang Huan's side and looked at him in confusion.\"It's the real deal!\"Tang Huan's old face blushed a little.Speaking from this point of view, his low level Weapon Refiner was indeed a little incompetent. He knew very little about the various smithing methods in this world, just like the low rank gems he had found in the Maze Realm Forest. There were even some that he could not identify.\"The 'Black Jade Crystal Iron' is it.\" Shan Shan rolled her eyes snappily.\"Yiya!\"Just then, an immature voice suddenly sounded out, interrupting Shan Shan's words.Tang Huan subconsciously looked over, to see that the Xiao Budian was standing at his feet. In front of it was an old wooden chest that was slightly larger than him.This box was obviously brought here by Xiao Budian.\"What's in it?\"Tang Huan carried the box in surprise and placed it on the stage.This was the first time he had seen this box, but since it was in this blacksmith shop, it definitely belonged to the old blacksmith, who knows where Xiao Budian found it. Although the box was old, the material used to make it should be extraordinary. When he touched it, he felt an exceptionally cool sensation.The chest was not locked, so Tang Huan casually opened it.At first glance, they looked like a ball of flame, but then at second glance, they also looked like a heart. Within the stone, one could faintly see the fine lines and patterns of veins, as if they were the veins of the heart.Tang Huan counted and found that it was exactly nine pills.\"Intermediate gem, Heart Flame Stone?\" Shan Shan's beautiful face finally revealed some surprise.\"You know him?\" Tang Huan looked at her, then turned his gaze back to the box, his eyes immediately lighting up. A middle ranked gem, the cheapest would cost at least a thousand gold, and the most expensive would probably cost tens of thousands of gold, he never thought that this old man would actually hide a middle ranked gem.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: 48Chapter 48 - Old Blacksmith Ou Xie\"Of course I do.\"Shan Shan snorted, \"This' Heart Flame Stone ', although it is only a middle-ranked gem, it is actually one of the rarest high-ranked gems. When used to forge weapons, it is able to unleash the Weapon Refiner's Power of True Fire when facing off against enemies.\"As he said till here, Shan Shan could not help but say, \"Tang Huan, although your master is incompetent, he is still not bad. He actually has hidden nine 'Heart Flame Stone'. At this moment, she suddenly felt a little curious towards the old blacksmith.\"Is the 'Heart Flame Stone' so precious?\"When Tang Huan heard it, he immediately beamed with joy and took out one of the \"Heart Flame Stone\" that was the size of a duck's egg.When he was in the box, he only felt that the gem was somewhat warm, but when he left the box, Tang Huan immediately felt that his palm was burning hot, and an abnormally intense heat was released. Compared to this \"Heart Flame Stone,\" the low-grade jewel \"Fire Cloud Stone\" was not worth mentioning.\"This gem is so hot.\"Tang Huan exclaimed as he returned the gem to the box. Only then did the cold aura of the wooden box suppress the heat in place.\"Of course, how could it forge the most suitable weapon for the Weapon Refiner?\" Seeing Tang Huan making such a fuss out of nothing, Shan Shan curled her lips.\"Yiya, yiya.\"The little guy also jumped onto the stage and proudly cried out twice. He squinted his eyes and raised his little head, looking like he was \"Hurry up and praise me\".\"Not bad, not bad.\" Tang Huan laughed and rubbed Xiao Budian's head. Xiao Budian was even more pleased with herself, his little claws scratched Tang Huan's arm, then he pointed at the gemstones in the box. Her mouth opened slightly, and licked it.\"You want to eat it?\"Seeing its salivating look, Tang Huan felt a headache coming on.Such a precious gem, if it was given to the Xiao Budian to eat, when the old blacksmith returns in the future and finds out about it, he would probably destroy this blacksmith shop in anger.\"Yiya?\"The Xiao Budian looked pitifully at Tang Huan.Tang Huan couldn't stand this move the most. Just as he was about to put his full heart into putting the lid back on the box, he realized that there was a piece of paper under the \"Heart Flame Stone\" that was filled with words.Under the pages, there seemed to be two thin booklets.Tang Huan's heart moved, he could not help but take out the paper. With just a glance, he was stunned, it was actually the old blacksmith's letter.\"Disciple, Master is going to the Origin Continent. I wonder when I can return.\"\"If you are able to find this box in my room, it means that you have cultivated out the Genuine Qi and have already become a Stage Six Martial Master.\"The nine 'Heart Flame Stone' in this box are things that Master left for you. If you can merge with the True Fire and become a Weapon Refiner, you can look at the refining manuals that Master left in the chest. When you become a middle stage Weapon Refiner, you can use them to forge a middle stage weapon for yourself.\"\"If you have fulfilled your wish of becoming Weapon Refiner and have sufficient strength, you can travel to Origin Continent 'Sword Crafting Valley' and 'Furious Billows Castle' in the future. I believe you will firmly remember the locations of those two places. If you fail to become a Weapon Refiner, going or not is of no importance. \"\"Disciple, take care of yourself when I'm not around.\"\"Master Ou Xie, stay!\"\"In addition, your master's name cannot be spread outside easily!\"\"Ou Xie? Master is actually called Ou Xie? \"After reading the letter, Tang Huan could not help but mutter.This was the first time he heard the old blacksmith's name, \"Names should not be spread to outsiders. It's so mysterious. Does master have any powerful enemies?\"Once he said that, Tang Huan suddenly remembered that Shan Shan was right beside him. He quickly turned his head and saw Shan Shan standing there in a daze, with unfocused eyes.\"Shan Shan?\" Tang Huan could not help but shout out.\"Ah?\" What is it? I was distracted. \" Shan Shan seemed to have awoken from a dream as an undetectable tinge of shock quickly flashed deep within her beautiful black eyes.\"Do you know who my master is?\" Tang Huan looked at her suspiciously.\"I don't know.\" Shan Shan quickly shook her head, she then pursed her red lips, and with a surprised look, she laughed: \"Oh yes, who is your master?\"\"If you don't know, then so be it.\"Tang Huan didn't know if she really didn't see it, or if he just pretended not to see it, he just smiled meaningfully.Afterwards, Tang Huan intentionally or unintentionally avoided Shan Shan's line of sight, opened up the paper once again, and read through it carefully. The caring expression that appeared between the lines made him feel very touched.He clearly understood why his master hid the box.Previously, he did not even cultivate the Genuine Qi, so even if the old blacksmith gave him these things, it would be useless. On the contrary, it might bring him some unnecessary trouble. In that case, he might as well not give him anything and let him be a normal blacksmith.But if Tang Huan really became a Martial Warriors and a real Weapon Refiner, these things would be of great use.However, the old blacksmith probably never thought that before Tang Huan even became a Stage Six Martial Master, this box would already be found by the shockingly skilled Xiao Budian.Tang Huan had heard of both the Sword Crafting Valley s his master mentioned before.The Sword Crafting Valley was the most famous refining holy land during the peak of the Human Clan, and also the origin of the True Fire. However, the invasion of the Demon Clan had turned it into a land of death, and it was said that even the once number one sword master of the Human Clan, Illusory Eyes, had perished in that calamity.Furious Billows Castle was very far from this Furious Waves City.A hundred years ago, when the Human Clan was unified and completely occupied the Origin Continent, a huge defensive fortress was built at the eastern edge of the continent, and they were able to look at each other across the ocean. They had already been occupied by the Demon Clan before, but they didn't know if they had been recaptured by the Human Clan's three great armies after their battle.Before Master left this time, she had drew two maps, and even pointed out two locations. After that, she didn't say anything and only told Tang Huan to remember them firmly.At that time, Tang Huan's head was full of fog.However, he now understood that it was a map of the Sword Crafting Valley and the Furious Billows Castle respectively. The old blacksmith wanted him to go to the two locations on the map.The old blacksmith did not say what kind of strength he had to go to Sword Crafting Valley and Furious Billows Castle, but it was definitely not something that the current Tang Huan could go to. According to the letter, he had to become a Stage Six Martial Master to be able to find this box.For example, the Sword Crafting Valley s generally could not enter its depths. As for the Furious Billows Castle s, if they were still occupied by the Demon Clan s, they might not even be able to enter the depths of the Sword Crafting Valley s.Therefore, Tang Huan immediately put this matter down and impatiently took out the two thin books at the bottom of the box.This was what he was most interested in right now.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: 49Chapter 49 - Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\"Heaven and Earth Art of Communication!\"\"True Flame Rainbow Spear Technique!\"Tang Huan quickly flipped through one of the thin books.It was unknown what rank of cultivation technique this \"Heaven and Earth Communication Talisman\" technique was, but the cultivation technique within it was definitely more profound than the \"Invigorating Meridian and Absorbing Spirit Art\" technique.The so-called Solitary Yin would not grow, and the Solitary Yang would not be long.The \"True Fire\" belonged to a type of extremely positive energy. When the Weapon Refiner fused with the \"True Fire\", as the \"True Fire\" increased in strength, it would definitely cause a backlash; the higher the rank of the Weapon Refiner, the more powerful the backlash. As a result, Weapon Refiner trained in the art of reconciling Yin and Yang, reducing or even eliminating backlash.This was one of the techniques left behind by the old blacksmith.Cultivating this type of cultivation method would be able to adjust Yin and Yang. Over time, it would reach the point where Yin and Yang would fuse together, and the heaven and earth would be on good terms. This was also the most natural law between the heavens and earth.The \"True Flame Rainbow Spear Technique\" did not mention what rank it was, but just by looking at its name, one could tell that it was extraordinary.As Tang Huan flipped through the pages, his heart couldn't help but surge with emotions. He was in high spirits and wished that he could immediately find a gun and test it out.\"It seems I'll have to forge a spear for myself.\"After a long while, Tang Huan finally put down the booklet in satisfaction.He didn't think too much of the old blacksmith's skills and techniques. In his mind, they were probably only at the intermediate stage. Therefore, he did not hide anything from Shan Shan, who was beside him. Someone who possessed a Divine Weapon and could fight against the Howling Firmament Wolf King, should not care too much about the middle leveled techniques and battle skills.However, after he finished reading, he realized that whether it was the \"Heaven and Earth Communication Talisman\" or the \"True Flaming Rainbow Spear Technique\", they were both extremely brilliant, especially the former.When he originally knew that the old blacksmith left the identity of the badge behind, he became even more suspicious of the old blacksmith's identity.\"In order to create a middle ranked weapon, a low ranked weapon cannot unleash the power of this' True Flame Flowing Rainbow Spear Technique '.\" Shan Shan suddenly spoke out.\"You know about this Spear Technique?\" Tang Huan raised his brows slightly.\"'True Flame Rainbow Spear Technique' is one of the top five Spear Technique s in all of Glory Continent. Such a famous Spear Technique, how many Martial Warriors have not heard of it? \"Shan Shan snorted, and looked at Tang Huan with contempt.Hearing that, Tang Huan was stunned.\"Alright, count me as a bumpkin.\"After a while, Tang Huan laughed at himself. He suddenly felt that the booklet was hot to the touch, what kind of person was this old man, to even have such a powerful Spear Technique?\"A bumpkin?\"Shan Shan blinked her beautiful eyes suspiciously, \"What do you mean?\"\"It seems like he has never seen the world before.\"Tang Huan casually explained, then asked with some doubt: \"I am only in Stage Three Martial Disciple, how could I train such a profound Spear Technique?\"\"No, at least it should be the Stage Four Martial Master.\" Shan Shan said indifferently, \"Furthermore, Stage Four Martial Master can only cultivate the first form of this technique.\"\"Looks like I can only train in the future.\"Tang Huan immediately felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over him. He shook his head in frustration and picked up another book.This was the refining manual left behind by the old blacksmith.Tang Huan only looked for a moment before completely sinking into the water.The book not only recorded the forging experience, techniques, and things to pay attention to, there were also various iron ore s and gems that were introduced to it. Everytime he saw a crucial point, Tang Huan would be enlightened, and the doubts he had would immediately be cleared up.Tang Huan watched very slowly, he suddenly frowned and thought, then suddenly smiled, as if he had completely forgotten about the existence of Shan Shan and the Xiao Budian.\"Yiya?\" The Xiao Budian looked at Tang Huan in confusion, then looked at the Heart Flame Stone in the chest, and gulped down a mouthful of saliva.\"Xiao Budian, let's ignore him. I'll bring you to eat something good.\"Shan Shan smiled as she grabbed the little fellow's ears, completely ignoring its protest. She stuck close to it and walked towards the back of the smithy.When the sky turned white, Tang Huan finally closed the refining manual and let out a long breath.This refining manual was written in a very shallow manner, especially with regards to refining. It was written in a very profound manner, making one feel that it was something that a low level Weapon Refiner could not write.\"Who the hell is this old man?\"Tang Huan was quite shocked, as his mind raced, \"It's impossible for him to only be a low level Weapon Refiner. Could he be a high level Weapon Refiner, or a Weapon Refining Master? But why would such a Weapon Refiner, if not a Stage Seven Martial Master, a Martial Lord of the eighth step, or even a Stage Nine Martial Saint of the eighth step, hide in such a small blacksmith's shop like a Furious Waves City? \"After a moment, Tang Huan suddenly thought of the Weapon Refining Grand Master's badge in his arms.\"Is this old man really Weapon Refining Grand Master? Someone who can become a Weapon Refining Grand Master, must also be a Stage Nine Martial Saint? \" For a moment, Tang Huan's brain was a little muddled.Master is not only a Stage Nine Martial Saint, but also a Weapon Refining Grand Master?How was this possible?After a long while, Tang Huan's brain cleared up. The possibility of that was too small, Glory Continent and Weapon Refining Grand Master, which one was not famous? If this old man was so powerful, people would have already recognized him.Even though that smithing manual was in the old man's handwriting, it might have been copied from someone. For example, the old man had the good fortune to find the relic of the original owner of the Grandmaster badge, as well as the \"Heavenly Communication Technique\" and the \"True Flaming Rainbow Spear Technique\".However, this explanation was a bit too far-fetched.Moreover, if this old man really was only a low level Weapon Refiner, he wouldn't even leave a message for him to go to some Sword Crafting Valley or Furious Billows Castle.Even when his head was about to explode, Tang Huan was still not sure.\"Forget it, I won't think about it.\"Tang Huan lightly patted his head, just as he was about to put the smithing manual into his pocket, he suddenly had an idea. He immediately flipped to the last page of the book, and the last sentence written on it was: \"I placed the item in the box, keep it safe, and do not let anyone know!\"\"Sandwich?\"Tang Huan looked left and right, and immediately took out the Heart Flame Stone s one by one, his gaze sweeping across the bottom of the chest, and after a while, he found traces of them. After fumbling around for a bit, he lifted up a thin layer of the wooden board.There seemed to be three of them, and on the gold page at the top was a single gun.This spear was very different from ordinary spears.Generally speaking, the spearhead was a rhombus shaped spearhead, with a high spine and thin, pointed blade. However, the spearhead had a unique style, the tip had a half rhombus shaped structure, then the two sides suddenly caved in, then slanted outwards, and after another caving, the two sides began to shrink.There were two depressions, making the two sides of the spearhead have slightly curved barbs.Not only that, when the spearhead shrank in, there were three curved spikes sticking out from both sides of it. Near the end of the spike, there were even more sharp spikes protruding out of it. It looked like there were a few strange little branches behind the spearhead that had a long pike.At the end, however, there is a barbed pattern of spikes.\"What kind of gun is this?\"Tang Huan was startled, this was the first time he had seen such a strange shape for a pike. In a blink of an eye, he had already picked up the golden page on top of, and immediately after, an incomparably violent domineering aura swept over from the page, causing Tang Huan's heart to tremble.In addition, this book is currently on the monthly ticket rankings, so my friends should have one or two more monthly tickets. Every time the monthly tickets exceed 100 months, they will release an additional Pie Exchange Code, and if there are a lot of code words, they will also be added to the list at six o'clock every day.Finally, thank you so much for your support.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: 50Chapter 50 - Five pages of the remaining volumesTang Huan was extremely shocked, in his eyes, the strange long spear on the golden page seemed to have become a living being, causing him to feel as if his own flesh body and even his soul were about to be crushed by this tyrannical and peerless Qi, as though he was reflexively releasing his fingers.After the golden page broke apart, that terrifying feeling also disappeared like a wisp of smoke in thin air. Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief, but suddenly discovered that his back was drenched in cold sweat!Just what was this thing that made it so terrifying?Although he had only held it for a moment, but he could feel that its texture was extremely strange. It was like paper, not like silk, not like silk, it was crystal clear, and that the long spear seemed to have actually merged with it.Carefully pushing it aside, Tang Huan saw the second golden page. On top of it was a sword, its shape was bizarre and exquisite.With the previous example, Tang Huan almost immediately let go of his.Even so, he still felt a bone chilling cold that caused his fingers to stiffen. Luckily, the time he took to hold it was very short, and the cold feeling immediately disappeared.On the third golden page, there was an exquisite longbow that was multi-colored in color. Its structure and shape were also quite complicated.\"Divine Weapon Catalogue?\"An incredulous exclamation suddenly sounded by his ear. Tang Huan suddenly turned around, and only now did he realise that there was an additional graceful figure by his side, and her beautiful face still had a touch of seductive laziness. It was obvious that she had just gotten out of bed, yet her eyes were still filled with unconcealable surprise.\"This is the 'Divine Weapon Catalogue'?\" The four words that came out of Shan Shan's mouth caused the shock in the bottom of Tang Huan's heart to surge like wild waves.\"Divine Weapon Catalogue?\" A mysterious map that could create Divine Weapon s?No wonder they felt so terrible when I held them! However, how could this old man possess a 'Divine Weapon Catalogue'?When he was in the Maze Realm Forest, he still wanted to see what the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" looked like from Shan Shan.Could it be that this old man is really Stage Nine Martial Saint? Weapon Refining Grand Master?And this Shan Shan, just who is she? She actually recognized that it was a \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" at a glance? Could it be that Howling Firmament Wolf King's deduction was not wrong, that she really had the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" fragment? If so, where was she hiding on him?\"Bam!\"In the next moment, Tang Huan suddenly closed the chest, and stared straight at Shan Shan, his eyes fierce and evil: \"Shan Shan, you don't plan to tell me anything?\"In that moment, suddenly had countless thoughts in his mind.If Shan Shan did not see these three pages of \"Divine Weapon Catalogue,\" nothing would have happened. But since she saw it, things became troublesome.Tang Huan knew nothing about her origins.Although after travelling with her for a few days, he had already agreed to her staying at home temporarily. Tang Huan had gained an understanding of her personality, but who could be sure that she wouldn't be tempted by this \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\"? Once she regains her strength, or divulges the news to her family and friends and elders, he reckoned that he would very quickly die without a burial.If he didn't trust her, wouldn't he kill her?Taking advantage of the fact that she had not recovered her strength, immediately killing her, was indeed an easy task, but Tang Huan was not able to do such a thing.Shan Shan had also just recovered from the shock, seeing how Tang Huan's face kept changing, he suddenly revealed a smile: \"Tang Huan, are you thinking about killing me with one slash?\"\"What do you think?\" Tang Huan's eyes were wide open as he said fiercely.\"Tang Huan, you can relax. I won't leak the news.\" Shan Shan stared at Tang Huan, his smile almost disappearing, his eyes full of seriousness.\"How can I trust you?\"Tang Huan remained silent for a moment, before speaking slowly.Shan Shan frowned, she thought for a moment, then clenched her teeth, as though she had made a huge decision with great difficulty.Immediately after, Shan Shan turned around and moved both of her hands along her chest and abdomen, rustling as if she was unbuttoning her clothes.\"You can't be thinking of committing suicide, right?\" Seeing Shan Shan's actions, Tang Huan was shocked.\"Your head!\"Shan Shan's body froze, and then she pouted angrily out of embarrassment. However, even though she said that, her hands still continued to move.Tang Huan could not help but pat his forehead: \"Alright, I admit that you are very beautiful. When I was at Maze Realm Forest, I wanted to do it multiple times, but, you don't need to use such a method to exchange for my trust. Even if you must do it this way, we should at least change locations, right?\"\"Tang Huan, shut up!\"Shan Shan finally turned around, and angrily stomped her feet as she cursed loudly. Her white and tender cheeks were as red as fire, and the blush of the sun had even spread to her ears, but her clothes were still as neat as before.\"What are you doing?\" Tang Huan looked at her suspiciously, only to find a thin pink cloth bag in her hands.\"Open it yourself.\"Shan Shan stuffed the cloth bag into Tang Huan's hands.Tang Huan was even more confused as he placed the cloth bag on the lid of the box. As he layer after layer of the bag were opened, he realized that there was actually something that looked like a layer of tin paper inside, which was cool to the touch. Once again, he opened it.\"This is also a 'Divine Weapon Catalogue'?\"Tang Huan looked at Shan Shan in shock. What did she mean by bringing out such a precious \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\"? Was she trying to show that she did not have any designs on my \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\"?Shan Shan bit her red lips lightly, and said slowly: \"Tang Huan, from today onwards, these two pages will be yours. Now, you still think that I will covet your copies of the atlas?\"\"For me?\"Tang Huan gasped.This was not an ordinary page, but a \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" that could make many cover their tracks and cause them to go crazy, even Demon Clan and Demon Clan were coveting it, so why did she give it up so easily?\"Why else do you think I took it out for you to watch?\" Shan Shan was still fuming, as she sneered with her vertical eyebrows.\"That's embarrassing.\"Tang Huan was overjoyed. While he was saying that he was embarrassed, his fingers quickly flipped open the golden page, revealing the bottom one.Of Shan Shan's two golden pages, one depicted a strange axe, a normal axe with only one blade, but it had two blades, and the other depicted an orange hammer.Adding the three pages in the chest, there were three kinds of weapons: spear, sword, bow, axe, and hammer.\"This axe is called 'Heaven Splitting Axe', and the hammer is called 'Orange Hammer'. Although this' Divine Weapon Catalogue 'is extremely mysterious and can cause countless people to go crazy with it, if no powerful Weapon Refiner is able to forge a Divine Weapon, it would be no different from trash. For example, in the hands of the current you, the five page atlas are just trash. \" Seeing Tang Huan's delighted look, Shan Shan was a little angry, and could not help but ridicule him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: 51\"Now they are trash, and in the future they will all be treasures. I will forge them all later. \" Tang Huan said while beaming, and did not mind her taunting at all.\"Stop bluffing!\"When Shan Shan heard it, she got even angrier and sneered, \"Even if it's the Weapon Refining Grand Master, being able to successfully forge a set of Divine Weapon, can be considered a miracle.\"\"He's so weak, can he even be called Weapon Refining Grand Master?\" Tang Huan said in surprise.\"You ...\"Shan Shan was so angry that she almost vomited blood. This bastard, what does he take Divine Weapon as? Something you can get one easily? If one did not have the right luck, it could take decades to gather the materials needed to forge a Divine Weapon.At that moment, Shan Shan almost took out her blue bow and ruthlessly hit him with it.\"That day in the cave, I clearly didn't see anything. Where did you hide it?\"Tang Huan suddenly thought of this question. Just as he subconsciously asked this question, a light, intoxicating fragrance wafted into his nose. It seemed to be the fragrance of Shan Shan's body.\"Shan Shan, you placed it in your underwear? \"Tang Huan suddenly came to his senses and opened his eyes wide in shock.After he finished speaking, Tang Huan couldn't help but rub his forehead. Although Shan Shan had taken off her undergarments, he had never thought that they would be hidden in that place.\"If you don't speak, no one will treat you as a mute!\"The redness on Shan Shan's face had only faded a short while ago, but after hearing Tang Huan's words, a red blush immediately started to rise.She did sew the cloth bag on the inside of her underwear.But when Tang Huan said it so brazenly, she couldn't help but recall the awkward scene in the cave back then.\"Shan Shan, can you help me see what these three weapons are called first?\"Tang Huan pretended not to see the change in Shan Shan's expression, he chuckled and opened the lid, quickly lifting off the three golden pages, so that she could see everything clearly.Shan Shan wanted to ignore him and walk away, but she couldn't help and continued to walk towards him. She only glanced inside the box and spoke indifferently: The spear is called 'Conqueror Spear', the sword is' Xuanyuan Sword ', and the bow is' Dragon Tongue Bow '.\"Xuanyuan Sword?\"The other two names were fine, but the familiar name caused Tang Huan to be stunned.Xuanyuan, was the Yellow Emperor of his previous life, the ancestor of Hua Xia. Could it be that this world also had people named 'Xuanyuan'? It seemed that he had to find a history book about the Glory Continent in the future.In an instant, Tang Huan put down the question: \"Shan Shan, that bow of yours is also a Divine Weapon, what's its name?\"\"It's called 'Kong ...'. Why should I tell you? \"After saying that one word, Shan Shan swallowed the rest of her words. She then rolled her eyes at Tang Huan and left huffily.Very quickly, she passed through the back door of the blacksmith shop, leaving Tang Huan with a beautiful view of her back.\"If you don't want to say it, then don't say it.\"Tang Huan also did not mind, his gaze then landed on the five pages of the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\", and laughed so hard that his lips almost reached the back of his ears, \"In one night, there were five pages of the Divine Weapon Catalogue, the Conqueror Spear, Dragon Tongue Bow, Heaven Splitting Axe, Orange Hammer ... A whole five Divine Weapons, I must forge them one by one in the future. \" Tang Huan's eyes lit up, he felt like he had just struck gold.After a long while, Tang Huan finally calmed his mind, and carefully folded the five golden pages together, and then wrapped them up with a piece of cloth. It was unknown what material it was made of, but it could actually conceal the terrifying aura of the fragment of the atlas, as if it did not leak out at all.Just as Tang Huan was preparing to wrap it up with the fragrant pink colored cloth, the sound of footsteps suddenly came up. Shan Shan ran over again, with a faint blush on her beautiful face.Tang Huan's lips slightly moved, but just as he was about to speak, Shan Shan grabbed that thin pink cloth and walked away. From start to finish, she did not even glance at Tang Huan once.\"Why is this woman so crazy? A piece of cloth that's supposed to be used to wrap up fragments of the Catalogue, it's not her underwear.\"Tang Huan could not help but mutter.Shan Shan who had just reached the back door of the shop staggered, and almost fell to the ground. After holding onto the door frame with much difficulty to stabilize her body, she turned her head and glared at Tang Huan angrily. Then, she took a deep breath, crossed the threshold in one step, and disappeared.Tang Huan shook his head and smiled, then placed the two books and the remnant catalogue back into his arms.But when he looked at the place where Shan Shan's figure disappeared once again, the smile in his eyes had completely disappeared, replaced with deep contemplation.In his senses, Shan Shan's identity had already become even more mysterious.When she mentioned the \"True Flaming Rainbow Spear Technique\", which was one of the top five Spear Techniques in the entire continent, she had a completely indifferent expression, as if in her eyes, such a powerful Spear Technique was nothing surprising. When she took out the two remaining pages, Tang Huan had also carefully observed her. She did not feel reluctant to part with them, but what shocked Tang Huan even more was that she had a very good understanding of the Divine Weapons inscribed on the two pages.Who was she? What was she doing in the Maze Realm Forest again?Tang Huan took a deep breath, the bottom of his heart carrying a deep doubt.Outside, the sky was bright.Not long after, the sound of clinking once more rang out in the blacksmith's shop that had been silent for dozens of days.Time flew by, and the armies of the three nations that were stationed at the \"Two Realms Plain\" continued to sail towards the Origin Continent, and many more began to return from the Origin Continent.As a land that they had to pass through, Furious Waves City became more and more lively.However, the return of troops was only one of the reasons why Furious Waves City was bustling with noise and excitement. The other reason was that Furious Waves City's \"Weapon Refining Competition\" was about to begin.In the Glory Continent, there were many different kinds of competitions. However, there were only two that could attract Weapon Refiners from all over the continent to participate.One was the \"Weapon Refining Sacred Assembly\" of Heavenly Forging City, which was held once every ten years, and participants should not be older than thirty years old. Furthermore, all of them had to be at least mid-level Weapon Refiners.The other one was Furious Waves City's \"Weapon Refining Competition\".It targets Weapon Refiners who are not more than twenty years old. Every five years, regardless of origin or cultivation realm, as long as he or she is a Weapon Refiner, one can register.In every tournament, there would be many young Weapon Refiners that would emerge as the targets for all the major powers and even the three Kingdoms to chase after.To the young Weapon Refiners, this was a good opportunity to become famous.Only when one's name became famous would one have a greater chance of obtaining all sorts of refining resources, increasing their refining strength and thus forging even more powerful weapons.After all, refining was a skill that burned through money.Other than the wealthy royal families of the three kingdoms , or some powerful forces or clans, a small clan simply could not support a single Weapon Refiner.Being famous through the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" was a shortcut.After the day of the competition for the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" had been set, the news was spread out through the branches in the various cities through the Divine Weapon Pavilion. A few months ago, Weapon Refiners began to set out on their journey, rushing to Furious Waves City from all over the place.Especially in the days before the competition, there would be many people rushing into Furious Waves City every day.Some were Weapon Refiners who were preparing to participate, some were Martial Warriors who came to observe the grand event, and some others were people who represented the various great powers in finding Weapon Refiners.The arrival of these people also caused the plaza in the middle of Furious Waves City to be packed with people.Every day, there would be a large number of young Weapon Refiners selling the various grade weapons that they had forged, and there were even many Martial Warriors lingering in front of various stalls.Generally speaking, these weapons were much cheaper than those found in weapon shops.At this time, the newly appointed Pavilion Master Qing Ye of the Divine Weapon Pavilion and Mu Kui also welcomed the two guests who were about to manage the tournament, making this usually quiet and peaceful place a little more lively.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: 52On the third floor of Divine Weapon Pavilion sat a grizzled old man in green. In his hands was a long spear.The spear was two meters long, and the spearhead was shaped like a sharp cone. The spearhead was extremely sharp, and five triangular blade-like protrusions could be seen below the spearhead. The entire spearhead was dark red, but the shaft that connected with the spearhead was actually emerald green.The old man in green tossed his spear over and over again with a focused expression.Opposite the old man sat a middle-aged man in white. Upon seeing this, he couldn't help but reveal a surprised expression on his face. By the side, Qing Ye and Mu Kui looked at each other, a hint of smile in their eyes.\"This spear is only a low-level weapon, the spearhead uses' Scarlet Crystal ', and the body uses' Jade Light Stone '. Generally speaking, for low-level weapons, only one type of gem is used, but in this spear two types are fused.\"\"Regardless of whether it is the body or the gems, both have been tempered to the limit. The timing of these two gems fusing into the spear body and the quenching process have been grasped perfectly without the slightest inaccuracy. The most amazing thing is that these two gems are not repelled by each other at all, but supplementary to each other.\"\"With the simplest method of fusion, the producer was actually able to fuse different gems and equipment base to such a degree. This is truly surprising.\"\"This spear has already reached the limit of a low-level weapon. Its power is probably comparable to that of ordinary mid-level weapons.\"\"Everyone, this person's forging skills are obviously at the peak of perfection. Even if I were to forge a low-level weapon, I'm afraid I still wouldn't be able to reach this level.\"The elder in green slowly explained the secret of the long spear with a face full of admiration.When Mu Kui and Qing Ye heard this, they couldn't help but smile. That middle-aged man said with some disbelief: \"Brother Gu, is this spear really that outstanding?\"\"Brother Wu Xin, take a look.\"The elder in green laughed, flicked his finger, and with a low hum, the long spear was thrown out. The middle-aged man's left hand took the spear, but his right hand immediately grasped the spearhead and slowly began to stroke it. His eyes were already slightly closed, as if he was carefully inspecting the situation of the spear.\"Little girl Qing Ye, little brother Mu, may I know which master made this spear?\" The old man looked at the two in surprise.\"Master?\"Hearing this word, Qing Ye suddenly burst out into laughter, her beautiful watery eyes filled with a strange expression.\"What? Did I say something wrong?\" Seeing her like this, the old man was even more surprised.\"Brother Gu, this is not created by a master but a low-level Weapon Refiner.\" A strange expression flashed across Mu Kui's eyes.\"Low leveled Weapon Refiner?\"The old man in green was shocked. The middle-aged man called Wu Xin also cried out in disbelief, \"A low-level Weapon Refiner has such an accomplishment? Brother Mu, are you kidding? \"\"Brother Gu, Brother Wu, this is all real. It's not a joke.\"Mu Kui slowly said. Actually, when he and Qing Ye first received this news, their reactions were the same as theirs.The day before yesterday, Qing Ye sent a mid-level Weapon Refiner of the Divine Weapon Pavilion to find out some news about that guy. In the afternoon, that mid-level Weapon Refiner came back with a spear that he said he bought from his shop for a thousand gold, and he personally saw him producing it.After carefully observing the long spear, both Qing Ye and Mu Kui were incomparably shocked.As for the mid-level Weapon Refiner, he was greatly provoked and stayed in Wonder Artifact Hall to forge weapons all day and all night, and he still had not come out yet.\"Who is that low-level Weapon Refiner?\" Old Man Gu anxiously asked.\"Brother Gu, please allow us to keep our secret for now. If nothing unexpected happens, we should be able to see him on 'Weapon Refining Competition' tomorrow.\"Mu Kui laughed as he took the long spear from Wu Xin's hands and pointed at the simple yet strange symbol at the end of the spear. \"Brother Gu, Brother Wu, please look, this is the 'Inscription' that the low-level Weapon Refiner left behind. If I am able to see this' Inscription 'tomorrow, it will definitely be him.\"Old Man Gu slightly nodded his head. \"Good. Tomorrow, I want to see which little fellow is able to forge such an outstanding low-leveled weapon.\"\"I'm also looking forward to it.\" Wu Xin also chuckled.\"...\"In the north of Furious Waves City, the blacksmith shop's doors were tightly shut.\"I still haven't broken through!\"In the yard at the back, Tang Huan who was sitting motionlessly under the tree suddenly opened his eyes and let out a sigh.In this period of time, he had been forging weapons during the day, and training in the \"Harmony Art of Heaven and Earth\" at night. Not only did his skills greatly improve, his Genuine Qi had also rapidly increased. Within the Dantian, the illusion of the Spiritual Wheel had reached its limit, and once it broke through, he could condense the essence and advance to Stage Four Martial Master.Therefore, after forging the last low-level weapon the day before yesterday, Tang Huan closed his blacksmith shop and focused on his cultivation.He had originally thought that his breakthrough had already reached the point where it was natural, but he never thought that the \"Spiritual Wheel\" currently within the Dantian would actually still be a ball of shadow that was constantly rotating.\"Tomorrow is the 'Weapon Refining Competition'.\"Tang Huan couldn't help but sigh.Although a powerful Weapon Refiner might not necessarily have a high level of artifact forging, powerful strength was still extremely useful for forging weapons. He was currently a Stage Three Martial Disciple, if he could become a Satge Four Martial Master, his skills in artifact forging would definitely increase.If he really couldn't break through, then so be it. Fortunately, during this period of time, he had been studying the manual left behind by his master and constantly experimenting on it. He was already no longer the same as before.\"Yiya!! Yiya!!\"Seeing that the sun was about to set, Tang Huan did not force it. He just took a deep breath and stood up, when Little Blue ran over and anxiously called out.\"What's wrong?\" Tang Huan said in surprise.\"Yiya!!\"Little Blue beckoned with its little claws at Tang Huan with all its might before swinging its legs and quickly running back to his room. After Shan Shan had moved in, his room had been taken over by her. During this period of time, Tang Huan had been sleeping in his master's bedroom.When he was about ten metres away from the room, Tang Huan heard a painful groan from inside.Tang Huan was extremely familiar with this voice. Thinking about the situation inside the cave, Tang Huan quickened his footsteps and rushed inside.On the wooden bed, Shan Shan twisted her delicate body, her consciousness already muddled. Her clothes were torn off, and her exposed skin became completely red.Even from a few meters away, he could still feel the heat radiating from her.\"That strange disease is happening again.\"Tang Huan did not hesitate at all, and immediately walked to the bed in big strides, and before he could even take off his shoes, he sat on the bed with his legs crossed. He then placed his palms on her soft and smooth abdomen, and immediately activated the \"Harmony Art of Heaven and Earth\" and the Nine Yang Divine Furnace to the extreme.Two streams of blazing heat continuously surged out from Shan Shan's Dantian, converging into the Furnace and then being refined, fusing together with Tang Huan's Genuine Qi.The sky gradually darkened, and night soon enveloped Furious Waves City.Little Blue took some charcoal from the stove in front and lit a candle in the room. Under the light's illumination, the gradually calming Shan Shan fell asleep, her entire body emitting an astonishing beauty and charm. Beside her, Tang Huan was standing still as a statue.\"Buzz!\"After an unknown period of time, a sound suddenly sounded out from within Tang Huan's Dantian, and the round wheel like shadow finally condensed into substance.A Spiritual Wheel was completely condensed and formed.This was the symbol of the Stage Four Martial Master! Tang Huan suddenly opened his eyes, his chest surging, his eyes revealing an excited look, he actually wanted to shout into the sky.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: 53In the early morning of the next day, when the sky had just begun to brighten, many Martial Warriors left their residences and gathered at the central plaza of Furious Waves City from all directions.As soon as they arrived at their destination, everyone discovered that after a night's time, the appearance of the area had greatly changed.Above the wide plaza, at least a few thousand iron tables were arranged neatly. And on the north side of the plaza, a platform that was about two meters tall had already been built.On the high platform, a row of seats were arranged in an orderly fashion.If one sat there, he would be able to view all the activity in the plaza from a higher vantage point.A red line had already been drawn around the thousands of metal tables. Everyone knew that they could not cross the red line while watching the competition, or else they would be severely punished.Time flew by, and more and more people gathered outside the red line.When Tang Huan rushed over, what he saw was countless people brushing past his shoulders. Such a scene really gave him a fright.Although he had registered to participate in the \"Weapon Refining Competition\", he did not think that the competition would have such a grand occasion.According to Tang Huan's memories, the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" that he had seen in the past would probably only be watched by tens of thousands of people, but right now, there were probably more than a hundred thousand people gathered here.This was before the tournament started, so there might be more people coming.Tang Huan recalled the orders he received when he registered for the competition and walked towards the right side of the platform at the northern side of the plaza. A square area was drawn with red lines there, its length and width each being around 100 meters.This was the gathering place for the participating Weapon Refiners.When Tang Huan stepped into the area, he couldn't help but take in a cold breath.There were probably more than a thousand Weapon Refiners present in this place. Some of them were sitting cross-legged on the ground, resting with closed eyes, or they were gathered in groups of two or three as they whispered to each other. They were all young boys and girls, some of whom even looked to be around eleven to twelve years old. This kind of brat, was he a low-level Weapon Refiner?\"To stand out in such a Weapon Refining Competition is extremely difficult.\"Tang Huan's eyes swept across the crowd, then looked at the rows of metal tables in the plaza, and could not help but exclaim.At this time, at the edge of the plaza, in Furious Waves City's most famous \"Return to Home\" restaurant, a thin old man was leading a beautiful young woman to a room on the fifth floor.The lady was Shan Shan.\"Miss, this is the most suitable room on the fifth floor. I already instructed that the fifth floor is not open today, so no one will come and disturb. You can stay here peacefully and instruct me whenever you need anything. \" The old man respectfully said.\"Uncle Hu, sorry for troubling you.\" Shan Shan said with a smile.\"This is what I should do.\"The skinny old man also smiled respectfully, \"There are dishes and wine, please enjoy your meal, Miss. If you have no other instructions, I will be out. \"Shan Shan nodded her head slightly, the old man then bowed and left, closing the door.\"Yiya!\"Shan Shan was holding a bag, from which Little Blue's little blue head peeked out.After sitting down by the window of the private box, Shan Shan looked towards the right of the high platform to search for Tang Huan's figure, Little Blue was also peeking its head out the window to watch. It was not suitable for Little Blue to show its face in such an occasion. Tang Huan originally wanted her to stay at home to watch it, but in the end, she still couldn't help but come over to take a look.Very quickly, she caught sight of that familiar figure, and a faint trace of a captivating red appeared on her white and tender cheeks.Including the two times in the Maze Realm Forest, Tang Huang had saved her for the third time last night.Under the blazing heat, her consciousness quickly sank into a trance-like state. From start to finish, she had no idea how Tang Huan had saved her. When she woke up this morning, seeing that her undergarments had been completely ripped off, she could already guess what kind of scene it was last night. It must have definitely been similar to when she was in the Maze Realm Forest's cave, and had all been seen by this evil person.When she thought about that scene, Shan Shan's face immediately turned red. She was extremely embarrassed, but she could not hate Tang Huan at all.After all, that was entirely due to her own body.\"Yiya!\"A weak call woke Shan Shan up from her stupor.In a blink of an eye, she discovered that Little Blue had slipped onto the table without her knowledge. Furthermore, it had poured all the fruit wine into its stomach.Although it was a fruit wine, it would still get drunk. Little Blue had already kicked left and right, swaying crookedly, while faint red light surrounded its ears, eyes and nose.\"Drunk?\"Shan Shan laughed helplessly. Just as she placed Little Blue, whose stomach was full of wine, back into the cloth bag, her attention was attracted by the earth-shaking sounds coming from outside.Countless people were shouting in the surroundings of the plaza. It was as loud as a tsunami, and the sound waves were overflowing.On the north side of the platform, a line of people had already filed up and were seated down one after another. It was exactly them. The crowd was cheering because the people sitting on the platform were all important figures.\"Look, look, it's Qing Ye and Senior Mu Kui. They are both said to be high-level Weapon Refiners.\"\"Tsk tsk, why are all the Heads of three great families here as well?\"\"This is Furious Waves City, when did the Heads of the three great families not appear during the time of the 'Weapon Refining Competition'?\"\"Those two seem to be generals who just retreated from the 'Two Realms Plain'. Such heavy killing intent.\"\"Who is that old man? And the one dressed in white beside him is also very unfamiliar? \"\"You don't even know who they are, you are truly ignorant and ill-informed. The one dressed in white is our Glory Continent's youngest Weapon Refining Master, Wu Xin. However, it was true that he rarely went out of Heavenly Forging City. That old man is the previous master of the Pavilion, Gu Yi. \"\"Wu Xin? Gu Yi? This year's competition will have two Weapon Refining Masters overseeing it? \"\"...\"Around the plaza, countless people were discussing.And on the right side of the stage, when Tang Huan saw a dignified middle-aged man with a square face, his eyes grew dark.If Tang Huan was not mistaken, that man should be the head of Tang Family, Tang Tianren. Tang Huan's soul originally did not have much to do with him, but after occupying this body and fusing with its memories, he had inherited the incomparable hatred he had for this heartless and unjust person.\"Everyone, silence!\"A tall and slim green figure walked to the front of the stage, beautiful and graceful, with a frown and smile that was extremely enchanting. It was Furious Waves City's current Pavilion Master, Qing Ye. Her voice was not loud, but it was extremely penetrating.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: 54\"All participating Weapon Refiners, please enter the stage.\"Following which, Qing Ye turned to the right of the stage. Thousands of very young Weapon Refiners had already gathered in the area.Hearing Qing Ye's words, everyone's expression was different from one another. Some were nervous, some were anticipating, some were confident, and some had a face full of blandness.Tang Huan also took a light breath, as his state of mind gradually calmed down.That Tang Tianren seemed to be a Stage Seven Martial Master, and it was said that the ancestor of Tang Family was a Stage Eight Martial Lord. It would be useless if Tang Huan could not reach that stage.After a short moment, under the guidance of the two young men, everyone entered.Not long after, a Weapon Refiner stood behind every metal table in the plaza. There are exactly right number of tables.\"Everyone, this time, the 'Weapon Refining Competition' is the same as the past. There are three trials.\"Qing Ye's eyes swept across the several thousand Weapon Refiners, her charming face carried a slight smile, \"The first one is the smelting of gems, a time limit of one hour.\"These words were like a stone that gave rise to a thousand ripples.\"It can't be, it's only been an hour?\"\"Wasn't it always two hours in the past?\"\"Right now, even the Weapon Refiner's assessment has become much stricter. Isn't it normal to shorten the time limit of the first trial?\"\"With just this alone, a lot of people should be eliminated, right?\"\"...\"Many Weapon Refiners cried out in alarm.Some people's expression changed even more. It was obvious from one look that they weren't confident at all, but there were still a few Weapon Refiners who remained calm, as if they had complete confidence in this.The people around the plaza were also slightly shocked. The noisy sounds once again rang out, and an enormous sound wave surged over the square.\"Completing the smelting of the gem within the time limit and passing the inspection will allow you to enter the second trial.\"As if she didn't hear the voice below, Qing Ye continued, \"The second trial is the refining of the equipment base, this time the weapon is a blade, and the time limit is also one hour.\"\"An hour? It's shortened again!\"\"Oh my god, how can an hour be enough?Refining, it's not just about forging or tempering, it's more about forging and tempering!\"\"If I had known this, I wouldn't have come here.\"\"...\"From within the group of Weapon Refiners, another round of wails rang out.\"If you can pass the bladework trail, it will be the third trial. The blending of the gem and bladework will take half an hour!\" Qing Ye smiled again.The entire stadium was strangely quiet when she said these words.To the vast majority of Weapon Refiners, they might not even be able to clear the first two trials. However, after hearing what Qing Ye had said, the calm and indifferent Weapon Refiners' expressions became somewhat ugly.\"Everyone, this time, Weapon Refining Competition is overseen by two Weapon Refining Masters, Gu Yi and Wu Xin, who have specially travelled here from Heavenly Forging City. If more than one Weapon Refiners were to pass the third trial, the two great masters will be the ones to judge the results.Qing Ye's beautiful eyes slightly narrowed as her smile thickened.\"Master Gu Yi, that was the previous master of Divine Weapon Pavilion of our Furious Waves City, not long after he was promoted from a high-level Weapon Refiner to a Weapon Refining Master, he went to Heavenly Forging City.\"\"Master Wu Xin is truly amazing. He is now the youngest Weapon Refining Master.\"\"With the two master teachers personally evaluating it, the final result will definitely be something no one doubts.\"\"...\"In an instant, the entire plaza became lively, even the people who did not know of the existence of Gu Yi and Wu Xin were shocked.Tang Huan could not help but look towards the platform again.There were a total of ten people on it, the two people in armors were generals that should have come down from the \"Two Realms Plain\".To the right of the two generals were two middle-aged men and an elderly man. Naturally, they were the Head s of the three great clans of Furious Waves City, and Tang Tianren was among them.There was still one empty seat beside Mu Kui, and it belonged to Pavilion Master Qing Ye. The last seat was occupied by a strange old man. Although Tang Huan did not recognize him, he had heard someone call out from afar just now. That person should be the owner of the Star Ocean Weapon Shop, Hai Kun.As for the old man in green, he should be Gu Yi, while the middle-aged man in white was Wu Xin.\"Everyone, in this competition, all participants will receive a Thunder Light Stone as a reward. Passing the first trial, you can get a low-level weapon worth over 800 gold coins. Passing the second trial, you can get a mid-level weapon worth over 2000 gold coins. \"\"Passing the third trial will allow you to obtain a piece of Red Iron Ore and an mid-grade gem, the Heaven's Net Stone!\"\"In addition, after the Weapon Refiner passes the third trial, the third place will receive another high level jewel 'Tiger's Eye Stone', and the second place will receive another high level jewel 'Obsidian Stone'. But not only will the first place receive one 'Tiger's Eye Stone' and one 'Obsidian Stone', there will also be a special reward, which Master Gu Yi will personally inform you about.\" When she finished speaking, Qing Ye gave a bright smile, like a blooming flower, beautiful yet moving.\"Boom!\"The noise from the surroundings of the plaza shook the sky. Within the plaza, cries of surprise also sounded in all directions. The waves of sound were like a thunderclap that surged into the sky.Upon hearing that all participants would be able to obtain one \"Thunder Light Stone\", those who were originally dispirited and depressed revealed a joyful smile. \"Thunder Light Stone\" was a low-grade gem worth three hundred gold coins and was extremely precious.When they heard about the reward for passing the first trail, even more people started cheering.The prices of low-level weapons varied, with the lowest being around a hundred gold coins. The highest being a thousand gold coins. A low-level weapon worth eight hundred gold coins could be considered a top-grade low-level weapon. When they heard that the reward for the second trial was a mid-level weapon, everyone was even more excited and kept shouting.When Qing Ye revealed the rewards of the third trial, \"Red Iron Ore\" and \"Sky Stone\", the atmosphere inside and outside the plaza had reached its peak. However, after hearing the names of the two high-grade gems, \"Tiger's Eye Stone\" and \"Obsidian\", come out of Qing Ye's mouth, everyone quieted down.However, after a short period of silence, even more intense sounds erupted from inside and outside the square.The \"Tiger's Eye Stone\" was shaped like a tiger's eye. The weapons forged with it was incomparably berserk, causing Martial Warriors to be able to unleash strength that far surpassed their own cultivation.The \"Obsidian\" was even more precious than the \"Tiger's Eye Stone\". It was said that the high-level weapon that could fuse with this gem had a miraculous effect in the process of breaking through from Stage Six Martial Master to Stage Seven Martial Master.Moreover, according to the rules of the tournament, this kind of reward was superimposed. As long as one passed the three trials, they would be able to make a lot of fortune. What's more, the first place with the mysterious reward made people look forward to it even more.Inform him personally by Master Gu Yi? To obtain the guidance of the master, or to be accepted as his disciple?Many of the Weapon Refiners were excitedly guessing.\"Divine Weapon Pavilion is indeed rich!\" After listening to the rewards, Tang Huan was also deeply moved.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: 55\"Everyone, quiet!\"Along with Qing Ye's tender voice, the entire plaza finally became quiet, \"Now, please take out the jade plates and 'light stones' in your respective drawers!\"The Weapon Refiners immediately took action, they all opened the drawer and took out the white jade plate and a fist-sized white jewel.In a split-second, a dazzling white light flickered on every metal table.Many of the Weapon Refiners secretly heaved a sigh of relief, but at the same time, many of them secretly complained in their hearts. Indeed, this \"Light Stone\" was not particularly difficult to refine. However, that was in a situation where there was sufficient time, and right now, it was only an hour.\"Everyone, please get ready!\"Qing Ye's tone was slightly raised, and after pausing for a moment, a clear and melodious voice resounded through the entire plaza, \"The first trial of the 'Weapon Refining Competition', now ... \"Begin!\"Almost at the same moment she finished speaking, the huge hourglass under the stage flipped over.\"Rustle, rustle!\"The loud sound of sand falling filled the air.Qing Ye walked back to her seat with a smile. At the same time, in front of the thousands of metal tables, almost all the Weapon Refiners were grabbing the \"Light Stone\" and putting it between their palms.Around the plaza, in the crowd people were whispering to each other. Within the arena, however, the atmosphere was extremely tense.\"Phew!\" \"Huff ...\"In the midst of an almost inaudible buzzing sound, dozens of metal tables lit up with a dark red flame. They all activated their True Fire in an extremely short amount of time and materialized on the outside.Tang Huan's hands also grabbed onto the gem, but he did not immediately activate the True Fire. Instead, he turned his eyes and quickly swept his gaze across the surroundings.\"So many experts!\"He had thought that his speed of activating the True Fire to appear on the outside was fast enough, but he never thought that there would be so many people who were not much slower than him. If Tang Huan was not mistaken, there might even be some mid-level Weapon Refiners hidden among these people.In just a moment, more than ten iron tables lit up with flames.\"Hmm?\"Tang Huan was about to retract his gaze, but he sensed something and immediately looked to his left.There was actually a well-dressed young man watching him from a few dozen meters away. He probably had the same idea as him, and wanted to observe the strength of his competitors first.That guy did not even pick up the \"Light Stone\".Seeing Tang Huan's gaze, the young man's brows slightly raised, his eyes revealing a provocative look. He then proudly turned his head to look forward, holding the \"Light Stone\" with both of his hands.\"Hu!\"In the blink of an eye, a small ball of flame was ignited within his palm. However, it immediately turned into a prairie blaze and expanded into a ball the size of a washbasin.At this time, the flames produced by the surrounding Weapon Refiners were also only the size of a bowl, but the well-dressed man's was many times larger than theirs. It was impossible for the people around the square to not see such an eye-catching scene. In the next moment, exclamations resounded one after another.\"What a strong flame, he can't be a mid-level Weapon Refiner, right?\"\"I wonder where that person came from?\"\"To become a mid-level Weapon Refiner before the age of twenty, his future is truly limitless.\"\"...\"The young man seemed to have noticed the commotion in his surroundings, and his face was full of pride.But just at that time, a sneer rang out a few meters behind the man.\"Hu!\"On the metal table, the fire that was as big as a bowl had also expanded to the size of a washbasin. It was not one bit inferior to the young man's flame.The young man looked back and his face slightly changed. His lips moved as if he was cursing.Tang Huan also subconsciously looked over, only to realize that the owner of the ball of flames was actually a tall and slender girl in a yellow skirt.She looked like seventeen or eighteen years old. Her features were pretty, her face was pretty, her skin was abnormally fair, her long hair was fiery red, and her pupils revealed a faint blue color. Her appearance was somewhat similar to some of the westerners Tang Huan had seen in his previous life.When she looked at the young man in front of her, her brows revealed traces of ridicule.Tang Huan took another glance and discovered that it was not only the young man and the yellow dressed lady who were having intense flames, several others also had flames of that size. One of them was a petite, baby-faced girl who was probably only fourteen or fifteen years old.\"I should start too!\"Tang Huang took a breath, and calmed down. In between his minds and Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" and the Spiritual Wheel began to spin at the same time. A blazing heat followed the Genuine Qi as it shuttled back and forth within the Spiritual Meridian, and very quickly, it arrived at the palms of both of his hands. It transformed into flames, and gradually wrapped around Tang Huan's palms.When it had expanded to the size of a bowl, the flames had stopped growing.This time, Tang Huan was not as eye-catching as two months ago, when he was participating in the low-level Weapon Refiner's examination. After all, as long as he passed the first stage, he would be able to obtain a low-level weapon. It was impossible for Divine Weapon Pavilion to reward them with two more gemstones just because someone performed better.Being low-profile can also catch powerful competitors off guard at the critical moment.The fire in the palm of the elegantly dressed young man in the distance raged, and the gemstone juice constantly dripped down. After a moment, he could not help but turn back to take a glance, his expression immediately becoming more unsightly, following that he glanced in Tang Huan's direction, his expression becoming a lot better.\"Huh?\"On the high platform, Qing Ye's eyes slowly swept across the group of Weapon Refiners.After a while, Qing Ye's gaze slightly paused, a trace of surprise flashed past her beautiful eyes: \"Why is this kid's performance worse than two months ago?\" But soon after, a smile appeared on her face and she muttered, \"What a little trick. He actually knows how to save his strength.\"\"Save?\"Mu Kui chuckled, and also lowered his voice, \"On the surface, he seems to be saving something, but after careful observation, you will realize that his flames are several times purer than two months ago.\" As he finished speaking, Mu Kui's eyes revealed unconcealable shock.\"Oh?\"Qing Ye opened her beautiful eyes wide, after a moment, she could not help but take in a cold breath, and exclaimed: \"It's really like that, how did this guy do it?\"To make the flame pure, the first step was to make the fire seed pure.However, the fire seed of a Weapon Refiner is already extremely pure, it is difficult to make it purer even for just a little bit. Not to mention that it was several times purer. Furthermore, he was merely a low-level Weapon Refiner, so it was even more difficult for him to accomplish this, as if he was trying to compress a bowl sized dough into the size of a duck egg.\"Pavilion Master, brother Mu Kui, which Weapon Refiner are you talking about?\" The old man by the side could not help but ask, he was Star Ocean Weapon Shop's owner, Hai Kun.\"You will know soon enough.\" Qing Ye suppressed the shock in her heart and kept it under wraps.\"...\"\"Master Gu Yi, Master Wu Xin, how's the performance of my niece?\"A tall and sturdy man wearing armor suddenly raised his hand and pointed at a petite girl in the crowd as he said with a smile.\"At such a young age, the True Fire is already so powerful, not bad at all. Un, she should already be a mid-level Weapon Refiner, right?\" Gu Yi stroked his beard lightly, and smiled.\"With the little princess' strength, it's more than enough for her to pass the third trial.\" Wu Xin also laughed.\"The third trial is nothing, this little girl is here to take the lead, the leader of the 'Weapon Refining Competition'.\" The armored man laughed loudly.\"This time's' Weapon Refining Competition ', not only are there Grand Princess of Mo Yun Empire, there are also Second Prince of Sha Long Empire, and there's even our Great Tang Empire's Little Princess. Such a grand occasion, I'm afraid that it will be difficult to reproduce in the next few decades.\" Beside the sturdy man, another armored elder laughed.\"That's right.\" Gu Yi squinted his eyes and laughed, \"Let's see who can obtain the head of the 'Weapon Refining Competition' this time around!\"\"Of course, it's definitely our Great Tang Empire's precious little princess, haha.\" The brawny man laughed until his eyes became two slits.\"...\"Gu Yi and Wu Xin looked at each other, and laughed without denying anything. If the Weapon Refiner who forged the long spear wasn't here, the little princess of Tang Empire would probably be the champion. If that person was present, her chances of winning the championship would be slimmer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: 56\"Rustle, rustle ...\"Amidst the unceasing sound of flowing sand, time quickly passed by.Unknowingly, each metal table was covered with a bright red flame. It was either big or small, extremely powerful, or slightly weak.Thousands of blazing auras intersected in the air, wildly filling the air.Even though these young Weapon Refiners were drenched in sweat, they were completely unaware of it, for they're all concentrating on the \"Light Stone\". Adding that the Weapon Refiners had all fused with the \"True Fire\", their endurance towards heat also far exceeded that of ordinary people.However, the people closest to the arena were feeling unbearable heat, and they all retreated backwards.\"Pfft!\" \"Puff ...\"About a quarter of an hour later, the faint sound of the flames extinguishing began to ring throughout the arena.The first one to complete the smelting of the gem wasn't the red-haired, blue-eyed girl in the yellow dress, nor was it the well-dressed young man. Instead, it was a very mature man in black, followed by the two of them and the baby-faced girl.Time flew by as more and more people completed the refinement of the \"Light Stone\".Tang Huan was completely focused, the white juice slowly condensed on the edge of his palm and dripped onto the plate. When the \"Light Stone\" had melted, Tang Huan crumpled the thick liquid into a ball and placed it on his palm. Then, he wrapped it up tightly with the weaker True Fire.The requirement of this first trial was to refine gems. This meant that after they were melted, they had to be tempered to remove all impurities from the gemstone juice.In the entire process, Tang Huan was neither fast nor slow. Yesterday, after he once again absorbed the heat from Shan Shan's body, his \"True Fire\" Fire Seed had condensed once again. Compared to when he had just absorbed the Profound Yang Flame Essence, the current Fire seed was only a quarter of its original size.The condensation of the Fire Seed made the flames appear incomparably pure. The heat emitted by a ball of fire of the same size was, however, multiplied by several times.If Tang Huan wanted to show off, he could definitely complete the refinement of the \"Light Stone\" within fifteen minutes.But in that case, there wouldn't be that kind of surprising effect in the end, so Tang Huan tried his best to slow down. Fortunately, after this period of practice, his control over the \"True Fire\" had become even stronger. Otherwise, he might not be able to hide it any longer.The portion of Weapon Refiners closest to Tang Huan were all completely concentrated, and did not sense the extremely strong heat emitted from the small cluster of flame in Tang Huan's palm, nor did they notice the white color at the center of the flame.After about half an hour, the flames in Tang Huan's palm quietly extinguished.In the blink of an eye, approximately forty percent of the Weapon Refiners had already finished refining the gems, but there were even more whose palms were still flickering with flames.Amongst the thousands of people, Tang Huan's speed was considered neither fast nor slow.The next step was to wait.Hearing the constant rustling sounds, and seeing that someone had completed the smelting of the gems, the pressure on the left Weapon Refiners grew increasingly stronger. Many people revealed anxious expressions, but the more anxious they were, the more mistakes they would make.As the time limit neared, the flames on a small number of Weapon Refiners' palms actually extinguished several times.\"An hour is up!\"And just at that moment, Qing Ye's voice, which had an extremely strong penetrating force, suddenly resounded in the air above the plaza.\"who have not finished refining, please leave the arena and rest on the right side.\" Qing Ye arrived at the front of the stage and swept her eyes across the stage.\"Sigh, I failed. If only there were more time.\"\"Even if another quarter, that's fine.\"\"I melted the gem, but I've only tempered half of it. What a pity, what a pity.\"\"...\"Dejected voices could be heard from time to time, and soon after, a few figures gloomily left the metal table and converged on the empty space to the right of the high platform.Tang Huan did a quick count; there were hundreds of Weapon Refiners who did not finish within the time limit.\"Next, we will proceed with the testing!\"As soon as Qing Ye's words fell, a dozen or so figures walked into the arena. Whether they were men or women, old or young, they were obviously all Weapon Refiners, and it was very likely that all of them were mid-level Weapon Refiners.Each of them had two lines, inspecting the area along the way.\"Incomplete tempering, not qualified!\"\"Tempering's not complete, not qualified!\"\"Too many impurities remaining, not qualified!\"\"...\"In the plaza, similar sounds rose and fell one after another. When the Weapon Refiners heard this result, they looked as if their parents had died, and helplessly left the arena with sullen faces.It was not like there were no Weapon Refiners to defend themselves, but it was a pity that it was useless.The Weapon Refiners who were sent to inspect not only had astonishing Perception Abilities, but they also had extremely good eyesight, which meant that the probability of them making a mistake was extremely small. After they explained the situation of the \"Light Stone\" juice thoroughly, the people who had refuted them in the end obediently left.Not long later, a middle aged woman came to Tang Huan's side.\"Hu!\"A ball of flame whizzed out from her palm, covering the gemstone juice on the plate.Very quickly, the middle aged woman finished her examination. She looked at Tang Huan in shock and did not say a word.It took more than a quarter of an hour for all the tests to be completed.The number of Weapon Refiners who were eliminated because they failed the test were even more than those who did not finish refining. There were even some Weapon Refiners who finished refining in advance that were eliminated. Some of the Weapon Refiners who were lucky enough to pass were secretly rejoicing. They had finally gotten their hands on a \"Thunder Light Stone\" and a low-level weapon!Currently, the number of Weapon Refiners still standing here was less than two thousand.\"Congratulations, you have passed the first trial of the competition.\"Qing Ye's smiling face was like a flower, \"Next, is the second trial, the forging of the blade. Now, please take out the 'Spirit Flexible Iron' from the drawer. \"Everyone followed her instructions, and after a while, a large cube of iron ore appeared on everyone's table.This \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" was completely different from iron ores like \"black profound iron\". It did not need to be hammered with fire or iron, it could be directly completed with \"True Fire\". When the \"True Fire\" was strong to a certain degree, the iron ore would become extremely soft, and could be kneaded as easily as dough.Of course, weapons made with this \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" were easily broken and couldn't be used against the enemy at all, but it was very suitable for this kind of test. The level of a Weapon Refiner's weapon forging skills could be easily detected with this \"Spirit Flexible Iron\".Thus, no matter if it was the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" that was held once every five years, or the other Weapon Refiners' competitions, they would often use this relatively common \"Spirit Flexible Iron\".\"The second trial, begin!\"With Qing Ye's order, the remaining Weapon Refiners began to move quickly.Those who were able to enter the second trial were all of decent skill and no one was a sorry apology. Not long after, a ball of flame seemed to have ignited in front of everyone. At this time, many of the Weapon Refiners who had been holding back before also used up all of their energy.It was impossible to train this \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" if the fire was small.Only when the intensity of the flame exceeded a certain point would the \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" quickly soften. In the second trial, there were very few Weapon Refiners who could still hide their abilities.The luxuriously dressed young man swept his gaze at the yellow dressed girl and the others behind him, and a sense of urgency appeared on his face.As for the Tang Huan he had originally provoked, had been completely tossed to the back of his mind.Previously, when he saw Tang Huan observe his opponent's strength before fusing the gems, he thought that Tang Huan was similar to him, with a decent level of artifact forging. However, the flames that Tang Huan controlled left him disappointed, as he completely lost interest in Tang Huan.Tang Huan was still neither fast nor slow, but the flame that was seeping out from his palm was a little stronger than the first round.Under the continuous burn of the True Fire, after only half a quarter of an hour, the \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" had already softened. Tang Huan's left hand controlled the flame as he continued to burn it while his right hand continued to knead and knead at the metal.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: 57To refine this \"Spirit Flexible Iron\", indeed there was no need to use a hammer, but the Weapon Refiner's hands acted as the hammer.While he was kneading them, inside Tang Huan's Dantian, the Spiritual Wheel and the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" were also operating non-stop. The scorching hot Genuine Qi penetrated into the iron ore bit by bit, and the movements of his right hand were also changing between fast and slow, heavy and light, as if they were following some kind of mystical rhythm in motion.At this time, the flame in Tang Huan's left hand was no longer as strong as before. It worked together with the Genuine Qi in his right hand wave after wave like a tide, washing away the impurities in the iron ore.This was like panning off sand and dirt in the stream, leaving only the gold.Of course, if he were to use strong fire, he would be able to get rid of the impurities, but he couldn't do it so thoroughly. If it was a month ago, Tang Huan would probably only know how to use strong fire to refine this \"Spirit Flexible Iron\", and after studying the old Blacksmith's Refining Manual, Tang Huan had also comprehended a variety of methods to refine iron ores.According to the old blacksmith, if he wanted to become a Weapon Refining Grand Master, he had to master these iron ore tempering methods. Because at that point, Weapon Refiners would frequently use their hands and rarely used any tools when forging weapons.\"Hmm?\"On the high platform, Qing Ye's charming eyes moved, and when her gaze fell on Tang Huan, she was completely stunned.Mu Kui, who was at the side, noticed her unusual expression and subconsciously followed her gaze. His eyes also revealed a look of surprise.\"Panning off sand?\"Hearing the words that Mu Kui blurted out, both Wu Xin and Gu Yi were a little surprised. Then, their eyes started to scan the crowd.In just a few short breaths, the two of them had noticed the figure in the crowd.Compared to the surrounding Weapon Refiners, the flame in that youth's palm was not only small, it seemed to even be a little too small and unstable.The others may found it worrying because it seemed that the flame may extinguish anytime. However, no matter whether it was Wu Xin or the others, both of them were people with excellent eyesight, and with a single sweep of their eyes, they were able to see the profoundness behind it. Although the strength of the flame was uncertain, it was nonstop, and when the flame was weak, it was as if the Power of True Fire was condensing and gathering. When the flame was strong, the power would erupt like a volcano.It was like a endless tide that rose and fell. Of course, when using this technique, one had to be extremely proficient in controlling the True Fire in their body. Otherwise, it was truly possible that the flame would extinguish.In addition, the coordination between the True Fire and the Genuine Qi also required skill. With only true Fire, and insufficient coordination with Genuine Qi, the effect of expelling the iron mine's impurities was limited.\"It's Panning off Sand, it's indeed Panning off Sand.\"Gu Yi exclaimed in surprise at first, then, his eyes revealed an expression of unconcealable approval, \"I didn't expect that among the 'Weapon Refining Competition', where the vast majority of them are low-level Weapon Refiners, there is actually a little fellow who can use a technique like this.\"\"That kid, he's probably just a low-level Weapon Refiner, right?\"Wu Xin took a light breath, he was also amazed, if the one who used this kind of Refining method, \"Panning off Sand\", was a high-level Weapon Refiner, then it wouldn't be surprising, but if it was a low-level Weapon Refiner, the difficulty would be so great that it would cause one's jaw to drop to the ground.\"Hey, that's not right. Brother Gu, look at his flame!\" Wu Xin suddenly exclaimed.\"What a pure and condensed flame!\" Seemingly at the same time, Gu Yi also noticed something. His expression was extremely moved, and he couldn't help but exclaim, \"Just look at the purity and concentration of the flames, most high-level Weapon Refiners wouldn't be able to do better.\"\"Masters, who are you talking about?\" Seeing them in such a state, the armored man beside them couldn't help but be curious.\"The tenth kid in the sixth row.\" After a long while, Gu Yi finally took a deep breath.\"The flame is so small, and it's unstable. Who knows when it might be extinguished. This kind of flame is really as powerful as you guys said? Also, that 'Panning off Sand' doesn't seem too surprising.\" The armored man stared at him for a moment, then he curled his lips and said, \"Look over there. My little niece's method of refining iron ore is truly beautiful. What a kind and pleasant sight.\"At the end, the armored warrior revealed an intoxicated expression.Gu Yi and Wu Xin looked at each other speechlessly. Talking about refining methods with this guy was equivalent to playing a lute to a cow.However, the little girl that he mentioned, was indeed not bad. Although her methods were not as exquisite as the \"Panning off Sand\", her control over the True Fire, as well as her coordination upon True Fire and Genuine Qi, were extremely good. Being able to have such a standard at such a young age was already something to be treasured.Amongst the remaining people, there were still some very outstanding Weapon Refiners. Moreover, a few of them should be mid-level Weapon Refiners.To have such a standard before the age of twenty could be considered a genius in the Glory Continent.However, compared to the little fellow who displayed the \"Panning Off Sand\" technique, it was inferior. Even the extremely pure and condensed flames were far from something they could compare with. They never thought that such a genius would appear in the \"Weapon Refining Competition\".And there was also the Weapon Refiner who forged yesterday's long spear. They wondered which one of them could it be him?Gu Yi and Wu Xin were excited, they couldn't help but look at Mu Kui and Qing Ye who were at the side.\"Tsk tsk, did you hear that, \"Panning Off Sand\"?\"At the side of the stage, a middle-aged man with an elegant demeanor was praising endlessly. He looked at the old man on the right and said, \"Brother Lu, it seems that the two masters value that little fellow a lot. I wonder which family's Disciples it is, he could be so outstanding. Brother Lu, your family also seems to have a few young Weapon Refiners, are they participating? \"This middle-aged man was Gu Jingcheng, the head of Gu clan of Furious Waves City. Brother Lu was Lu Li, the Head of the Lu family.\"They did participate, but one didn't even pass the first trial. other two barely passed the first trial, so I guess they'll have to stop at the second trial.\" The old man called Lu Li helplessly shook his head, looking at the outstanding youths in the plaza below with a face full of envy.A Weapon Refiner was not something that could be raised just because someone wanted to.\"Brother Tang, how about your Tang Family?\" Gu Jingcheng looked to his left and asked Tang Tianren.\"Ugh ...Our Tang Family only has one person participating, and he is still here, so he might be able to pass the second trial? \" Tang Tianren forced out a smile, his expression extremely ugly.\"Your Tang Family and Lu Family are both not bad, unlike my Gu Family, not a single person is participating.\" Seeing him act that way, Gu Jingcheng's eyes flashed with ridicule, but he sighed.\"Your Gu Family doesn't have any outstanding Weapon Refiners among the younger generation, but there is a Gu Ying who has a good chance of becoming a Stage Nine Martial Saint.\" Lu Li scolded.\"Gu Ying is indeed not bad.\" Gu Jingcheng's face was proud, but he squinted his eyes: \"I wonder who will be the champion of this competition?\"\"Could it be that Brother Gu wants to recruit the champion?\"\"I don't dare hope for the champion. If I can recruit one of the kids who pass the third trial, I would be satisfied.\"\"...\"Listening to Gu Jingcheng and Lu Li singing the same tune, Tang Tianren looked down at the figure on the stage coldly, and a long sealed memory appeared in the depths of his mind. Seventeen years ago, a beautiful woman was brought back to his house by him, originally he wanted to treat her injuries and take her as a concubine. However, that woman refused to surrender, and after a month, her belly was slowly growing bigger and bigger ...Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: 58Everyone on the platform was whispering to each other, while everyone below the platform was completely focused.After approximately half an hour, the flames in Tang Huan's palm extinguished and the cube of Spirit Flexible Iron had already transformed into the shape of a blade. In the blink of an eye, Tang Huan swept his gaze over, only to discover that there were only a few dozen people who completed it before him. He thought that he was slow enough, but to his surprise, he was even faster than the majority of the people present.He originally didn't want to attract too much attention in the second trial. That way, he would be able to have an unexpected effect in the third trial.But now, it seemed that many people would be interested in him.Sure enough, after a while, Tang Huan noticed that many of the Weapon Refiners had their gazes on him, especially the young man dressed in elegant clothes. When he looked at him, his expression became somewhat gloomy, and his fair and handsome face had a sense of humiliation, as if he was being fooled.What's wrong with this guy?Tang Huan shrugged his shoulders and innocently blinked his eyes a few times.Seeing Tang Huan's expression, the young man became even more embarrassed and angry, he coldly glanced at him and turned his head. However, when the yellow dressed girl behind him saw this, she couldn't help but let out a delicate laugh. Although her smile was instantly withdrawn and her face was tense, it still revealed a moving charm.Tang Huan no longer bothered with the surrounding gazes and directly sat on the ground and closed his eyes to rest.\"The second trial is over!\"When the rustling sound disappeared again, Qing Ye's voice resonated once more.This voice was clear and beautiful, but to the many Weapon Refiners who had not finished their refining, it was like hitting their heads.Shortly after, the noisy wails rose and fell one after another.Tang Huan stood up, and realized that the number of Weapon Refiners that had been eliminated this time around, had at least reached a thousand.\"Begin the examination!\"Dozens of Weapon Refiners entered the stage once again. Almost every few moments, Weapon Refiners who did not pass would come out of the competition grounds dejectedly.When the test was over, there were only about five hundred people left.\"Congratulations on passing the second trial. Next, was the third and last trial of the Weapon Refining Competition. If there were only three people that had passed, then they would be the top three for this year's competition. If there are ten people who pass this trial, then, there will be two great masters, Gu Yi and Wu Xin, who will personally inspect the result and decide on the ranking. \" Qing Ye smiled and stressed once again the rules for judging the result.The voice lingered, and the atmosphere in the arena began to become somewhat oppressive.Aside from a few Weapon Refiners who were still maintaining a slightly relaxed expression, the expressions of the rest of the people had become quite solemn. Each trial of Weapon Refining Competition was more difficult than the former one. The third trial was even more difficult, especially when the time limit was shortened.\"Everyone, the third trial has begun!\"After pausing for a moment, Qing Ye decisively shouted out, and the hourglass, which had already been replaced by a smaller one, suddenly flipped over.This time, practically all of the Weapon Refiners were not in a hurry to act. They stood at the table, adjusted their breathing, calmed their minds. For fusing the gems and equipment base, speed was not enough. The more anxious they were, the easier it was for problems to occur.Tang Huan squinted his eyes, with a sly smile on his face.With that said of Qing Ye, Tang Huan's left hand grabbed the blade.\"Hu!\"The \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" and the Spiritual Wheel were already activated to its limits, and exceptionally fierce flame sprayed out from the palm of his hand. In an instant, it turned into a huge dark red fireball, completely engulfing the blade in his hand, and a scorching aura spread out crazily.Previously, the strongest flame that appeared in the first trial was only the size of a basin.However, the flame that Tang Huan was using, had a diameter that exceeded the length of the blade in his hand. The blade was about 90 centimeters long, but the flame reached a meter.\"Hiss!\"This huge commotion immediately attracted the attention of everyone on the field. Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air at almost the same time. Their eyes were wide open as they stared blankly.Earth-shaking cries of surprise immediately sounded out from the surroundings of the plaza.\"Hmm?\"On the high platform, Gu Yi, who was originally sitting down, as well as the Head s of Furious Waves City's three great families all stood up with a look of disbelief. Only the two armored generals were still sitting there, their bodies slightly leaned forward, their eyes wide open.\"What happened to you?\"At the edge of the stage, Qing Ye had just turned around and walked towards her seat when she saw such a strange scene. She could not help but ask in astonishment as she subconsciously turned her body around. And she immediately noticed that enormously huge flame.\"This, this...\"Qing Ye's red lips slightly opened, her beautiful eyes staring straight ahead.She had just announced the start of the third trial and that brat had already created such a huge commotion, causing him to immediately become the focus of everyone's attention.\"Rustle, rustle!\"The hourglass was not affected in the slightest, and the sound was as clear as a string.After Tang Huan made his move, all of his attention was completely focused on the equipment base in his palm, and not the slightest bit distracted by the surrounding gazes.After being stunned for a while, the participating Weapon Refiners finally regained their senses.\"What a fierce True Fire! Where did this kid come from?\"\"I've paid attention to him before. The first trial is rather ordinary, but the second trial is a bit fast, but nothing special, how come in the third trial ...\"\"This fellow is really cunning. He hid his strength in the first two trials in order to amaze everyone in the third trial!\"\"...\"Everyone cried out in surprise, their expressions shocked. Such a violent flame, completely exceeded their imagination, was this still a low-level Weapon Refiner? It's impossible for even mid-level Weapon Refiner to have such a powerful flame! Could that be the disguise of a high-level Weapon Refiner?It seemed impossible, all of the participating Weapon Refiners were all registered in the Divine Weapon Pavilion, who could fake it? As for the Divine Weapon Pavilion itself, it would not do such a thing!\"Who is this little bastard?\"The well-dressed young man seemingly gnashed his teeth as he growled in a low voice. His handsome face also had an unsettled expression.After seeing Tang Huan's performance in the first trial, he had forgotten about him.After he had completed the second trial in advance, he had inadvertently taken a glance at it and felt a trace of wariness rise up within him. He was also an experienced and knowledgeable person, and faintly felt that the method Tang Huan used to refine the Spirit Flexible Iron blade was somewhat unusual, it was kind of like the \"Panning off Sand\".But he could not be sure, and even so, he still viewed Tang Huan with some importance.However, he had never expected that Tang Huan's strength would actually far exceed his own expectations. In the previous two trials, he had only been deliberately hiding it all.\"Un, something is amiss...\" After staring at the flame in front of Tang Huan for a while, the young man's face suddenly changed.\"White Flame Core! It's a white flame Core! \" A young man shouted in shock.\"In the Five Elements, white is gold! He is a Weapon Refiner of the metal type! \" Immediately, some people came to their senses. They were so shocked that their jaws almost fell to the ground.\"Metal type Weapon Refiner? He's actually a metal type Weapon Refiner? \"\"I heard that in Furious Waves City there was a martial warrior who could produce a twelve meter totem flame, and he's of metal type. Could it be him?\"\"Impossible, impossible! It's only been more than two months, and his' True Fire 'and the level of his artifact forging can already be raised to such an extent?\"\"...\"Shocked exclamations continuously sounded in the arena.\"Type of Metal ...Type of Metal ... \" The well-dressed young man finally woke up. His face was ashen, and his teeth had nearly shattered from clenching.\"This person is deeply hidden!\"Not far behind the well-dressed man, the yellow dressed girl let out a long sigh. Her red lips slightly parted, and her voice was like a mosquito's buzz as she muttered to herself. A strange light flashed within her pair of enchanting dark blue eyes.\"Gosh, this time's Weapon Refining Competition, I will definitely lose the champion.\" At the front of the arena, a baby-faced little girl blinked her eyes a few times before being jolted awake.\"I heard from Senior Mu Kui that Furious Waves City has a very powerful low-level Weapon Refiner. Is that him?\" An elderly-looking man dressed in black could not help but exclaim.\"...\"At this moment, the surrounding area in the plaza was filled with wave after wave of loud noise.\"Dark horse!\" He is definitely the biggest dark horse in Weapon Refining Competition this time! \"\"This Weapon Refiner ... He was really good to hide. In the first two trials, he did not reveal his true abilities, but in the third trial, he suddenly displayed his strength, shocking everyone to the point that they almost choked. \"\"It's definitely impossible for this person to be a low-level Weapon Refiner, or even to be a mid-level Weapon Refiner, he must be a high-level Weapon Refiner. Otherwise, how would he possess such a powerful flame?\"\"Bullshit! He is a low-level Weapon Refiner, and he even fused with the 'True Fire' two months ago! \"\"...\"\"Haha, I recognize him. He seems to be called Tang Huan. That day I was in Star Ocean Weapon Shop, and I just so happened to see him use the 'Fire Shadow Totem' in the weapons shop, and ignite a twelve-meter tall totem flame. What's even more unbelievable is that he even had a physique that was metal type! \"\"It's my first time seeing a metal type Weapon Refiner! I wonder how he succeeded! \"\"The time since he fused the 'True Fire' was so short, yet he was able to ignite such a terrifying flame?\"\"Otherwise, how could he be a genius! Needless to say, the champion of this time's' Weapon Refining Competition 'is undoubtedly this guy. \"\"...\"\"Type of metal, type of metal ... Twelve meters of totem fire ... It was actually him ... He is that Tang Huan! \"On the high platform, Gu Yi was muttering some words, his face was full of unconcealable shock, and his eyes were wide open. After a long while, Gu Yi suddenly turned his head and said, \"The low-level Weapon Refiner who forged that long spear should be that person, right?\"\"Exactly.\"Mu Kui slowly nodded his head and walked back as well. Both of their eyes were filled with shock. They were well aware of the situation of the guy below. In just a short span of two to three months, his \"True Fire\" had actually risen to such an unbelievable level.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: 59\"I can't believe it!\"Wu Xin took a deep breath, and couldn't help but feel astonished. First, it was the miraculous \"Panning off Sand\" technique, and then it was an extremely pure and concentrated flame.The guy below was refreshing their knowledge step by step.Until the very end, only then did everyone realize what was happening, and connect him to the Tang Huan who had caused such a huge ruckus in Furious Waves City more than two months ago.A twelve meter long totem flame, the body of metal type ...The day that he had succeeded in fusing with the \"True Fire\", he had passed the examination of low-level Weapon Refiner with an astonishing performance, and had even absorbed a huge amount of \"Profound Yang Flame Essence\" from the Hidden Blade Hall without dying. He knew everything about Tang Huan even though he was in Heavenly Forging City.The reason why he and Gu Yi had come to Furious Waves City, aside from overseeing this \"Weapon Refining Competition,\" was mainly to see if they could bring him back to Heavenly Forging City.But he never thought that Tang Huan would bring such a pleasant surprise to everyone at the \"Weapon Refining Competition\"!\"Not only is the True Fire extremely pure, it is also extremely powerful. After fusing with the True Fire for only two months, he can already reach such a level. This is truly unimaginable, and what's even rarer is that his body of metal type.\" Wu Xin slowly let out a sigh of relief, his eyes shining with excitement.\"With his current strength, it should be easy for him to forge a mid-level weapon.\" Gu Yi's face also flushed red. \"Little girl Qing Ye, little brother Mu Kui, it looks like it won't be long before your 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' will test him to be a mid-level Weapon Refiner.\"\"That depends on when he wants to come.\"Qing Ye took a deep breath, suppressing the intense shock in her chest, a sweet smile surfacing on her beautiful face.At this time, the armored man who had been unable to hold back any longer finally spoke out, \"Pavilion Master Qing Ye, are you sure that he's from Furious Waves City?\"\"Exactly.\" Qing Ye smiled and nodded, she did not hide it.\"Good!Alright!\"Hearing that, the armoured figure laughed until his mouth could not close, and praised repeatedly: \"So he is a member of our Great Tang Empire, that's easy. Once Weapon Refining Competition is done, I will bring this little brother to the capital city, Fallen God City, and ask my royal brother to bestow upon him. \"He had just returned from Origin Continent yesterday, so he was not very clear about what was happening there. However, hearing what Gu Yi, Wu Xin and the rest had said just now, he could roughly guess what was going on. This genius Weapon Refiner who has body of metal type must definitely be recruited into the royal family.Hearing that, both Qing Ye and Mu Kui's face darkened.\"Your Highness Prince Zhao, this won't do.\"Gu Yi calmed his heart, and said while beaming: \"This little brother is an important person to be nurtured in our 'Divine Weapon Pavilion'. In the future, he will definitely be a pillar of our 'Divine Weapon Pavilion'.\"\"Hehe, Master Gu Yi, how does your Divine Weapon Pavilion plan to nurture him?\" The armored man looked at Gu Yi.\"I plan to send him to Heavenly Forging City, and ask the Pavilion Master to take him in personally as a disciple.\" Gu Yi said with a face full of smiles.\"Becoming a disciple of the Weapon Refining Grand Master, oh, not bad, not bad.\"But right after, his tone suddenly changed, \"However, will this little brother be able to become the master of the 'Divine Weapon Pavilion' in the future?\"\"This ...\"After Gu Yi heard this, he was stunned.If it wasn't for that peerlessly talented girl, that brat below might really become a Pavilion Master one day. But now ...\"Can't be?\"Seeing that, the armored man laughed, \"But if he followed me to Fallen God City, it would be different. My royal brother has no son, so the one to inherit the throne in the future will definitely be my little niece. I plan to request my royal brother to take him as consort and make him the empress's husband in the future. As for the Weapon Refining Grand Master? Our Tang Empire Ancestor is one of them! Master Gu Yi, what do you think? \"After hearing what he said, the faces of Gu Yi, Wu Xin, Mu Kui and the rest all changed. To anyone else, the temptation was extremely strong.And what he said, was indeed something that the Divine Weapon Pavilion could not give him.\"Haha, Prince, there's no hurry to say this, let's see how the 'Weapon Refining Competition' is going to turn out.\" Wu Xin rolled his eyes and laughed.\"That's right, let's watch the tournament then.\" The armored warrior nodded his head and laughed. He looked as if victory was already in his grasp.\"...\"Hai Kun's eyes flickered. The situation at the weapons shop that day was something that he only found out about after returning to Furious Waves City a few days later. Thus, that day, he went to find the Blacksmith, but Tang Huan had already left.Today, Tang Huan's performance in the arena was astonishing, Divine Weapon Pavilion and Royalty of Great Tang Empire would never let such a genius in artifact forging off, and Star Ocean Commerce's chances of getting him were even slimmer.Once he missed the opportunity to recruit Tang Huan, then there would be no more. If when Tang Huan activated the totem flame, he was in Star Ocean Weapon Shop, the result would be completely different. Maybe Tang Huan had already joined the Star Ocean Commerce.On the other side, the Heads of Furious Waves City's three great families also had different expressions.It was unknown what Tang Tianren was thinking about while his face darkened. Lu Li looked at the young man behind the huge fireball, as if he had seen some kind of unreachable treasure. Gu Jingcheng, on the other hand, was smiling, and when looking at Tang Tianren at the side, his eyes occasionally revealed ridicule.Meanwhile, on the arena, it was already a scene that was like a raging fire.The powerful flames and the white flame core that Tang Huan had unleashed had stimulated the rest of the Weapon Refiners to the point that they couldn't breathe anymore. In the end, they could only suppressed the undulating emotions in their hearts, using \"True Fire\" at the fastest speed possible to wrap the blade with fire.\"It's about time.\"With a thought, Tang Huan flipped his right palm, and the \"Light Stone\" juice that was wrapped in fine fire suddenly covered the blade, and then, quickly, it swept the blade away, and in less than a blink of an eye, Tang Huan's right palm had already swept across both sides of the blade at lightning speed.Following that, the flames on Tang Huan's right palm suddenly intensified, while the flames on his left palm gradually weakened, and was quickly replaced by the Genuine Qi.Inside the Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was revolving rapidly, while the Spiritual Wheel began to vibrate slightly according to a mystical rhythm. The Genuine Qi was like a strong wave, endlessly passing through the palm and entering the blade, while the True Fire in his right hand also trembled slightly like water, as if resonating with the Genuine Qi.Not long after, the Genuine Qi and the True Fire in Tang Huan's hands came to a screeching stop at almost the exact same time.\"Hu!\"Tang Huan exhaled lightly and placed the blade that was red like fire on the table. A weapon forged with this \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" didn't need to be especially quenched, it could be cooled down by itself. Moreover, it could cool very fast, it only needed a few minutes to do so.Tang Huan looked around and saw that the hundreds of people around were still busy. He could not help but reveal a slight smile.The huge ball of flames from before had long made him the target of attention. Now that he had completed the fusion, Tang Huan was immediately discovered by the people around the plaza.\"It was actually completed! Such speed! As expected of our Glory Continent's only metal type Weapon Refiner! \"\"It hasn't been a quarter of an hour yet, right?\"\"Not to mention a quarter of an hour, it hasn't even been one eighth of an hour!\"\"To complete the fusion so quickly, I wonder how good the quality will be?\"\"The quality of the weapons forged by 'Spirit Flexible Iron' is definitely not comparable to the other iron ores. However, the third trial is to test the timing of the fusion of the bladework and the gem.\"\"...\"Everyone was amazed.In the room on the fifth floor of the restaurant, when Shan Shan saw this, a charming smile that could overturn the heavens appeared on her extremely beautiful face. \"This scoundrel is still so despicable! The other Weapon Refiners who participated in the tournament, especially those who wanted to fight for the top three, are currently under a lot of psychological pressure. \"\"Right now, anyone can see the potential of this scoundrel. Those guys onstage will definitely fight for him.\"Muttering softly, Shan Shan pursed her red lips slightly, as she looked at the figure in the distance with her beautiful eyes. Don't look at how she didn't have much of a reaction, when she found out that Tang Huan was a metal type Weapon Refiner for the first time, the shock in her heart wasn't any less than that of the people outside.Inside the competition ground, Tang Huan had nothing to do as he looked around.\"Bam!\"A loud noise suddenly came from behind. A young Weapon Refiner saw that Tang Huan had completed the fusion, and was distracted for a moment, as he subconsciously smeared the gem juice on his blade. The blade immediately exploded, turning into countless pieces, and fell onto the metal table.The teenager stood blankly in front of the table. After a long while, he finally snapped back to reality and glared at Tang Huan, leaving the competition grounds.Tang Huan couldn't help but twitch his mouth and continue looking around.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: 60His carefree and leisurely manner actually caused the surrounding participating Weapon Refiners to grit their teeth in anger. Not long after, several more Weapon Refiners withdrew from the competition due to their failures.And as time passed, more and more Weapon Refiners failed due to the inappropriate timing of their fusion.For this kind of \"Spirit Flexible Iron\" forged equipment base, the safest way was to use a small fire to burn it, and let the fine holes slowly expand on the surface of the blade, that way, the fusion of the gems would be much easier, not only was the timing easier to grasp, but also the following step of fusing the two was easier.However, this would take a very long time. Generally speaking, it would take at least an hour.But this time, the time of the third trial had abruptly decreased to half an hour. This already made everyone a little nervous, and Tang Huan's stunning performance in the third trial made everyone feel even more unbalanced, to the point where they even felt a strong sense of pressure.To complete the fusion in such a short period of time, everyone had no choice but to use fierce flames.But just how big the flame should be, how hot was it to burn the blade, and when to fuse it together was not easy to grasp.Therefore, it was also a test of the abilities of many Weapon Refiner.\"Bang!\" \"Bang ...\"The closer to the end, the more explosive the sounds were, and one Weapon Refiner after another left the competition ground dejectedly.When the sound of the hourglass stopped, and Qing Ye announced the end of the third trial, the number of Weapon Refiners who left after their fusion failed due to the explosion of the blade had actually reached almost half. Immediately after, among the remaining Weapon Refiners who had not completed their fusion process, another one to two hundred people had left, leaving less than fifty people behind.\"Now, let's begin the blade testing!\"Qing Ye shouted. As she spoke, she and Mu Kui nearly leaped down from the stage at the same time. Mu Kui moved from left to right, she moved from right to left, continuously examined the blades.\"You may have completed the fusion, but your fusion was too poor. You won't be able to pass it!\"\"Fusion is too poor, not qualified!\"\"...\"More and more Weapon Refiners were judged as having failed by Mu Kui and Qing Ye. Looking at the shadows of the people leaving one after another, many of them felt a chill in their hearts.\"Tang Huan, you truly make me look at you in a new light.\"Before long, Qing Ye gracefully arrived in front of Tang Huan's table. First, she looked at the weapon he had forged, then nodded with satisfaction. She couldn't help but praise. \"It's really rare to see that you could forge such a weapon in such a short period of time.\"\"Pavilion Master is too kind, I guess it's okay.\"Tang Huan chuckled.Qing Ye smiled again, and then left Tang Huan's table and walked to the next Weapon Refiner.Dozens of meters away, the young man who was dressed beautifully, was originally watching Qing Ye, but when he heard her praise of him, his face immediately turned green. Especially when Qing Ye saw the weapon he forged, she only nodded without saying a word.Around half a quarter of an hour later, the blade test was over. There were only thirteen people left on the field.\"Everyone, congratulations, you are the only ones who passed the 'Weapon Refining Competition's third trial.\" Qing Ye smiled, \"Next, the weapons you guys forged will be sent to the stage. They will be appraised by Gu Yi and Wu Xin personally, and three of them will be chosen to be ranked.\"\"Pavilion Master, how can we guarantee that the weapons we forged will not be confused with others.\" The well-dressed man gritted his teeth and coldly said.\"All weapons will be marked with a label. Everyone's name, and origin will be recorded on the label.\"Qing Ye smiled beautifully.With that, Qing Ye clapped her hands. A young man who was already waiting at the side holding a wooden tray, walked over to the first young Weapon Refiner from right side .There was paper, pens, and even some viscous liquid on the plate.Very quickly, the man was in front of Tang Huan, and the blade hilt had already been tagged. Tang Huan followed suit and in a few moments, he had already placed the weapon that he had forged onto the plate. The man walked in succession, and before long, he followed behind Qing Ye and Mu Kui onto the stage.\"Your name is Tang Huan?\"Suddenly, an immature voice sounded.Tang Huan looked over in a blink of an eye, only to realize that there was a girl in a delicate and exquisite white dress beside the table. She was only fourteen or fifteen years old, had a delicate and beautiful baby face, and her skin was as white and tender as snow.However, although she was not tall, her body was well-developed. Although she was not comparable to the exceptionally hot and sexy Shan Shan, she was quite curvy.Given another few years, she would not even be inferior to Shan Shan in the slightest.\"That's right, I am Tang Huan. You are?\"He had a deeper impression of this baby-faced girl. In the first trial, the flames she displayed were very fierce, and the technique she used in the second trial was also very ingenious. As for the third trial, she had also grasped the timing of the fusion process well. With the weapon she forged, she might be in the top three.\"My surname is also Tang, and I am called Tang Yun. Are you willing to participate in the 'Weapon Refining Sacred Assembly' two years from now?\" The baby-faced girl stared at Tang Huan, as though she was looking forward to it.\"Weapon Refining Sacred Assembly?\"Tang Huan was startled, he then realised that when the little girl spoke, she actually revealed two sharp canines, it was extremely cute and adorable. Although he didn't understand why she would ask that, Tang Huan still smiled and said, \"The next time will be in two years time? so if there is a chance, I will of course participate.\"\"Alright then!\"Tang Yun seemed to heave a sigh of relief and waved her fist hard, \"Tang Huan, this time, I am not as good as you. Next time, I will definitely surpass you. Even though you have great talent, sometimes, hard work is more important than talent. I will work very hard.\"\"Huh?\"Tang Huan was startled, she came here just to say these words to him?Tang Huan smiled faintly in his heart, but just as he was about to speak, Tang Yun held her long skirt and walked away with her head held high, like a proud little hen.What a competitive girl!Tang Huan shook his head slightly, and saw another figure walking towards him. It was the young man dressed in luxurious clothing, and his expression was extremely gloomy.\"Tang Huan, right? You have truly surprised us.\"A few meters away, the well-dressed man laughed coldly, \"However, do you think that you can win by such a small trick? I ...\"\"What are you? Scram!\" Tang Huan squinted his eyes, his lips curled up into a cold smile, this guy, he had long hated him, he was only a middle Weapon Refiner, although his level was not high, he was extremely arrogant, causing people to be annoyed.\"What did you say?\"Hearing Tang Huan's words, not only was the luxuriously dressed man stunned, the few Weapon Refiners who had gathered around were also stunned.\"Do you not understand human language? Then I'll say it again. Scram!\" Tang Huan enunciated every word.\"You ... You actually dare to tell me to scram? \"The well-dressed man finally came to his senses. His handsome face alternated between red and white, and anger burst out from his eyes. How dare you! Do you know who I am? \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: 61\"I don't know who you are. I only know that a dog is barking madly in front of me! \"Tang Huan scoffed.This guy did indeed look like someone with some status, but so what? This was the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, and he was a refiner. As long as he was in this city, no one would dare to kill a refiner who was recognized by the Divine Armament Hall, even if it was a member of the three great empires.\"You are courting death!\"Not only was his fist speed as fast as a meteor, the force of his punch was incomparably majestic. Wherever his fist passed, the sound of wind and thunder would be heard, and at the same time, a scorching sensation pervaded from his fist.\"Rank four Martial Master?\" Tang Huan immediately judged the man's strength.\"You want to compete with me in the power of true fire?\"Tang Huan laughed out loud, and equally punched his fist, looking as though he was floating, as though he did not have time to even activate his True Fire.When the well-dressed man saw this, a cold smile appeared on his face.\"Bam!\"In a split-second, the two fists collided head on.'s punch seemed to be light and powerless, but the moment it came into contact with the man's fist, a strong surge of true energy roared out of the corner of his mouth along with an incomparably burning heat. It was actually like the eruption of a volcano, and was unstoppable.\"En!\"Only after being forced back five steps did he manage to stabilize his body. He felt the blood in his chest churning as a burning pain rushed up from his right fist. He immediately retracted his hand to take a look, only to discover that the back of his right hand was charred black.Lifting his eyes to look at Tang Huan, who was standing unmoving at his feet, the well-dressed man found it hard to believe his eyes.He had already condensed a Rank 1 Spiritual Wheel two years ago, and stepped into the Rank 4 Martial Master realm. As for Tang Huan, she was obviously younger than him, but her strength had actually already surpassed his?Impossible! He hadn't used his full strength just now, which was why he had taken advantage of her!\"Sorry to disappoint you!\"Tang Huan looked at him mockingly, \"I am also a Level 4 Martial Master. Moreover, from the looks of it, I seem to be a little stronger than you.\"\"You \u2026\"The well-dressed man tightly clenched his fists. His handsome face swelled to the color of a pig's liver.He could not accept the fact that his own strength was inferior to Tang Huan's, and the looks of shock in the crowd made him angry from embarrassment.\"Tang Huan, if you can take one of my punches, I do not believe you can take another!\" The well-dressed man gnashed his teeth, let out a low growl, and raised his fist once more.\"Stop!\"But just at that moment, a thunderous angry roar suddenly burst out in the air, causing people's ears to buzz incessantly, \"Tang Huan, Sha Tu, whoever attacks again, the outcome of this competition will be considered a failure!\"In the blink of an eye, he looked at the furious Mu Kui on the stage. He could not help but loosen his fist as he glared at Tang Huan with cold eyes and said with a cold voice, \"Brat, consider yourself lucky this time! But next time, you won't be so lucky.\"]\"\"That's what I wanted to say to you.\"Tang Huan laughed heartily. \"A pretty boy like you, if I bumped into you somewhere else in the maze forest, it would be enough for me to beat you up seven or eight times in this short amount of time.\"\"How?\" A young man at the side could not help but ask.\"How?\"Tang Huan glanced behind Sha Tu and teased, \"Why do you need to ask such a simple question? You can just find a stick and stick to stick in there, there's such a stinky place, do you really want to do it?\"The crowd burst into laughter.In Tang Huan's previous life, he rarely fought with others over words, but this young Tang Huan, had grown up together with the Tang Clan Disciples s, fighting and cursing at them. All kinds of vulgar explanations could be made instantly, and Tang Huan, who had assimilated the young man's memories, was also greatly affected in this regard.In his previous life, he wouldn't have been able to say such words.\"You, you \u2026\"In terms of bickering, how could Sha Tu be Tang Huan's match? He was so angry that his face flushed red and his entire body trembled. With these harsh words, Sha Tu turned around and left without any further hesitation.\"This King?\" Tang Huan muttered, \"Could this guy be a king of a certain country?\"\"You're right.\"A clear and melodious voice suddenly interjected.Tang Huan looked over to see a lady with red hair and green eyes in yellow dress standing a few metres away from him. She had a light smile on her face.\"This Sha Tu is the second prince of the Emperor of the Kingdom of Sharon. At the age of sixteen, he was bestowed the title of king, and right now, he is not only a fourth rank Martial Master, but also a middle rank blacksmith. He came here to participate in the Weapon Refining Competition because he wants to accumulate more capital so that he can go back and fight with that elder brother of his.\" \"It's a pity that I bumped into you. His plan was probably foiled.\" The yellow dressed lady said, \"However, I'm afraid that you will be the focus of people's attention in the future.\"The surrounding crowd was stunned. That Sha Tu was actually the second prince of the Sharon Empire? This Tang Huan fellow was also bold, to actually dare to humiliate the Emperor of the Sharon Empire in such a manner! After a short moment of surprise, many people looked at Tang Huan with a hint of schadenfreude.This guy must be feeling extremely regretful right now, right?\"You know so much about Shatu? Could she also be the royal daughter of some country? \" Tang Huan only smiled at the yellow dressed woman, his expression still calm.\"Mo Ye, the Grand Princess of the Moyun Empire!\" The yellow dressed lady's expression remained indifferent, \"Tang Huan, from now on, we are friends!\"\"Hiss!\"Gasps could be heard at the same time. Not only was the prince of the Sharon Empire here, even the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire was here. Could that person called Tang Yun be the royal daughter of the Great Tang Empire? If that was the case, then all of the royal Disciples of the three empires would be here!\"Friends?\" Tang Huan didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\"Isn't the enemy of our enemy our friend?\"There was a light smile in Mo Ye's beautiful eyes. The surrounding men all came back to their senses and looked at Tang Huan with a bit of envy. To be able to get the hands on the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire, it must be an honor for them, not to mention that the Grand Princess was so beautiful.\"To put it this way... That's true! \"Hearing that, Tang Huan nodded his head lightly, but he quickly glanced at Mo Ye and laughed slowly. He changed the topic, \"However, it is one thing for me to have enmity with him, and it is another for you to have enmity with him. I do not wish to be involved in the enmity between you two, so, it is fine if we are not friends.When the surrounding people heard Tang Huan's words, they were all stunned.Mo Ye was the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire, she was the younger sister of the Emperor of the Mo Yun Empire.\"You \u2026\"Mo Ye also did not expect Tang Huan to respond in such a way, her delicate body trembled, and she was instantly stunned, following that, fury seemed to flash deep in her deep blue eyes.You really don't know what's good for you!The hearts of the surrounding young men were filled with rage, and just as they wanted to jump out and reprimand Tang Huan, to vent the anger of the Grand Princess, Qing Ye's beautiful voice sounded from the stage: \"Everyone, the results of this' Artifact Forging Competition 'have been released! \"The third place is \u2026\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: 62The ten plus people on the battleground were unable to care about anything else. Numerous gazes were thrown toward the tall platform. The noisy surroundings of the stadium also gradually became quiet.\"God-down City, Tang Yun!\" After pausing for a moment, these five words suddenly burst forth from Qing Ye's mouth.\"It's her!\"Tang Huan raised his eyes and looked at the baby-faced little girl. With her skills and abilities, she should be able to get third place.However, she came from the God-down City, and her surname was also Tang, so she couldn't be the Disciples of the Great Tang Empire Royal Family, right?When Tang Huan heard about the Second Prince of the Shutu Empire and the Grand Princess of the Moyun Empire, he couldn't help but think about things.\"Boom!\"Just as this thought flashed through Tang Huan's mind, waves of loud noises sounded around the plaza, as though it was going to tear one's eardrums apart.After listening and listening for a while, Tang Huan's face revealed a look of understanding.That baby-faced girl was actually the little princess of Great Tang Empire, and the cheers coming from the surroundings were obviously the warriors of Martial Warriors who had just returned from Plain between Two Continents.On the high platform, the two armored men clapped their hands and laughed.As expected of someone from the royal family, to be able to obtain third place in the \"Pre-Refining Competition\" at such a young age, if she was a few years late to participate in the next competition, she would definitely be ranked first.Hearing this result, the little girl Tang Yun pouted her lips and became a little sullen. Whereas among the dozen or so weapons craftsmen that still remained in the arena, quite a few of them had expressions of disappointment on their faces.\"The person who will be ranked second will be \u2014 Ancient Luo City's Mo Ye!\"Not long after, Qing Ye's voice resounded once again.Hearing this, Mo Ye was stunned, but immediately after, the faintly discernable anger in her eyes was replaced by a trace of faint happiness.It was obvious that she was quite happy to be ranked second in the \"Artifact Forging Competition\".After all, to young artificers, this \"Artifact Forging Competition\" could be considered the largest competition in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City. To be able to stand out in this kind of competition and enter the top three, the name of the Honor Continent would definitely be known to everyone within a short period of time.Third place and second place had both been announced, and now there was only first place left!Not far away, Sha Tu's expression had already turned slightly black.The third place was not him, the second place was not him, and the first place \u2026Sha Tu clenched his fists tightly, and his breathing became slightly hurried. He seemed to be tightly gritting his teeth as he stared at the graceful figure on the stage. However, a trace of hope still remained in the bottom of his heart.Both the outside and the outside of the plaza immediately quieted down, and their faces revealed a strong sense of anticipation.The true mastermind of this \"Artifact Forging Competition\" was about to be revealed!Aside from a few young people who died in the past, the leaders of the previous competitions all became famous Master Refiners of the continent, and some even became Tools Refining Great Master s.For example, Gu Yi and Wu Xin, who were both at the top of the stage, were both once the heads of the \"Artifact Forging Competition\". Now, not only were they now master artificers, they were even important figures of the Divine Armament Hall. Qing Ye and Mu Kui, both of them had participated in the \"Artifact Forging Competition\" before. Although they were not the strongest, they were still ranked in the top three.[] [Table of Contents]The champion of this year's competition would not be an exception!When they thought of the lucky chance they had to witness the future master refiners and even the Tools Refining Great Master participating in the Artifact Forging Competition, many people were a little excited in their hearts.Within the arena today, there were only thirteen people left. The third ranked Tang Yun and the second ranked Mo Ye, the first place would be obtained from the remaining eleven people.At this time, the majority of the spectators had their eyes on Tang Huan, who had just had a conflict with another person.From the start of the third stage, he, who had performed quite normally in the first two rounds, was like a dark horse that had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, revealing an incomparably frightening expression. Not only did the flames he summoned far surpass all the other competitors, but the speed at which he passed the third trial was also far ahead of everyone else.That artificer called Sha Tu was the second to complete it, but he had used almost twice as much time as Tang Huan.This was an insurmountable gap! However, if the quality of Tang Huan's fusion was not as good as Sha Tu's, the champion of the competition could also fall to the side.\"The first place winner of this year's competition is...\"On the high platform, an intoxicating smile blossomed on Qing Ye's charming face as she looked towards the arena with both of her eyes.Sensing the movement of the green leaf, Sha Tu took a deep breath.Immediately after, he discovered that when those two gazes landed on him, an uncontrollable joy immediately surged from the bottom of his heart, and the feeling of humiliation that Tang Huan brought earlier was immediately thrown out of the window. The corners of his mouth slightly lifted, and an excited smile emerged on his handsome face.Could it be him?However, after a short moment, the smile on Sha Tu's face froze!Qing Ye's gaze only paused for a moment before he turned away from the voice. A bad premonition immediately rose up in his mind and his mood immediately fell from the peak of ecstasy to the bottom. He suddenly turned his head around and two incomparably resentful gazes swept over that despicable fellow.\"... Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, Tang Huan! \"Sure enough, these five notes soon rang out in the air above the square.Qing Ye's voice was as beautiful and moving as usual. However, when Sha Tu heard it, he felt as if he had suffered a heavy blow. His face immediately swelled purple.\"Boom!\"Another earth-shattering sound wave echoed in the square like thunder.Especially the Martial Warriors s, and the warriors of the Great Tang Empire s, their shouts were loud and clear. The Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City was in the city of the Tang Nation, so Tang Huan was naturally a citizen of the Tang Nation.On the high platform, not only were the two armored people clapping their hands and laughing, Gu Yi, Wu Xin, and Hai Lun were also smiling from ear to ear.On the other side, Gu Jincheng and Lu Li even stood up with a smile. For the equipment forgers from the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City to be able to get the champion of the competition, it was indeed a honor for them, two of the two Patriarchs of the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City's three great Families. However, although Tang Tianren who was by the side also stood up, his face was extremely gloomy.\"Brother Tang, Tang Huan's surname is also Tang. Could he be the refiner participating in the Tang Clan's competition?\" Gu Jingcheng suddenly looked towards Tang Tianren and said smilingly.\"Brother Tang, congratulations!\" Lu Li also came to his senses and chuckled.\"This Tang Huan has nothing to do with our Tang Family?\" Hearing that, Tang Tianren looked like he ate mouse poop while eating porridge, his face turning even uglier.\"That's not right, how come I heard that Brother Tang has a son called Tang Huan?\" Gu Jingcheng had a surprised expression.\"You \u2026\"In the blink of an eye, he turned to look at the armored man and the rest who were not far away, but then endured it all and spoke with a cold tone, \"Patriarch Gu, I will say it again, this Tang Huan has nothing to do with our Tang Family.\"\"Alright, so be it. Brother Tang, no need to be angry.\" Gu Jingcheng quickly smiled. Lu Li's expression also became strange.\"Tian Ren, this Tang Huan is your son?\" At this time, the armored man was pleasantly surprised. He had vaguely heard the conversation of the three but now the square was too noisy so he only caught a few words from time to time.\"Your Highness heard wrongly, this Tang Huan is not a Disciples of our Tang Family.\" Tang Tianren did not dare to get angry at the armored man, and immediately forced a smile.\"So that's how it is, what a pity!\" The armored man shook his head in regret.\"...\"[] [Table of Contents] I will look at all of your messages, but some of them may not be answered.

    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: 63\"I finally did it!\"Even though he already had a premonition, after hearing the result from Qing Ye himself, Tang Huan was still extremely excited. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"Not only that, he felt like crying as he heard the surrounding shouts.In the depths of his memories, that youth's wish was only to cultivate true qi and fuse it with his \"True Fire\", becoming a mere artificer. Having watched the \"Artifact Forging Competition\" several times, he had once imagined himself standing on this stage one day and sweating like the rain while competing with young artificers from all over the continent.But now, not only had his wish been fulfilled, Tang Huan had even become the chief of the \"Artifact Forging Competition\"!Suddenly, Tang Huan seemed to have sensed something, and his eyes looked towards a certain place on the stage.Although they were very far away and he couldn't see the look in that person's eyes clearly, Tang Huan could still feel the intense anger that must have appeared in those eyes.The corner of Tang Huan's lips curled up slightly, forming a ridiculing smile. [] [Table of Contents]After Qing Ye announced the results, the gazes of the dozen or so blacksmiths around all landed on Tang Huan.Tang Yun's pretty face was tense and her expression cold, while Sha Tu's gaze was even more so as sharp as a blade, as if he wanted to tear Tang Huan to pieces. However, even more refiners had looks of envy and jealousy that were difficult to hide.The third place would receive a \"Tiger Eye Stone\", the second place would receive a \"Obsidian Stone\", and in the first place, not only would one need a \"Tiger Eye Stone\" and a \"Black Obsidian Stone\", one could also receive a mysterious reward from an ancient master.As the champion of the tournament, one could imagine just how abundant the rewards were.Moreover, the reward was secondary. The most important thing was the reputation that he would gain from it.It was estimated that not many days would pass before everyone in the Honor Continent, and even the entire Origin Continent knew of the two words \"Tang Huan\" and the fact that this was an artificer of the five elements that were metal. As for the other ten people who had passed the third stage of the competition, naturally even fewer people would bring them up.\"Now, please enter the stage to receive your prizes from the top three participants and the refiners who have passed the third stage!\" Qing Ye's smile was like a flower, and his voice was like a silver bell.\"Humph!\"Sha Tu snorted coldly. He swept Tang Huan with his venomous gaze, and actually turned around and left without hesitation. In his palace, where there were so many precious things, he did not come to this \"refinery\" for a piece of hematite and a stone of Heaven.Tang Huan laughed out loud and walked towards the stage. Mo Ye, Tang Yun and the others looked away and also started to move.On the high platform, there were already thirteen young men waiting there with wooden trays in their hands. Gu Yi had personally given them to them, and he had even given them to them from the back.When Tang Huan received Gu Yi's wooden tray, he couldn't help but beam with joy.On the wooden board, there was a blade and a sword. They were respectively the low level weapon of the first stage and the middle level weapon of the second stage. There was a flat rock that was as big as a washbasin and as dark red as fire.In addition, there were also four gems.A dazzling purple gem was called the \"Thunder Stones\"; a light black gem with a layer of spider web-like white stripes was called the \"Heaven Stones\"; and a gem the size of a goose's egg with a yellow dot at the center was called the \"Tiger's Eye Stones\". One could feel the domineering aura from it at a glance.There was also a pitch-black object that emitted a dazzling black light. It looked like a small black hole. It seemed to be able to swallow all the light in its surroundings. It was the \"Obsidian Stone.\"The price of high-grade gems was over a hundred thousand each. For example, this \"Tiger's Eye Stone\" would cost at least two hundred thousand gems, and the \"Obsidian Stone\" would be nearly five hundred thousand gems.The price of Tang Huan's reward this time was close to eight hundred thousand, and this could not even be considered to be the mysterious reward of Ancient Yi.\"Kid, well done.\"Just as Tang Huan confirmed the reward with a smile, she slapped his shoulder heavily. Immediately after, a rough and hearty laughter entered her ears.Tang Huan immediately turned around, and an armored man with a moustache and beard was standing in front of him. His eyes were filled with smiles, and standing beside him was the cute girl Tang Yun who looked like a doll.\"You are?\" Tang Huan thought for a while, since this person was so close to Tang Yun, it was very possible that he was one of the Emperor of the Tang Kingdom.\"He's my uncle, Tang Zhao!\" The little girl giggled.\"Tang Zhao?\"Tang Huan was shocked.Tang Zhao was not only the younger brother of the Great Tang Emperor, he was also one of the three generals of the Origin Continent. He had led an army to fight with the Devil Clan for several years, and it was said that he was often the leader of the troops.In addition, his title in the Great Tang Empire was named after him and was named \"Reflecting King\".\"Oh, so it's Your Highness, Tang Huan greets you.\"Tang Huan's expression became serious, and he bowed, his tone filled with respect. His admiration wasn't because of Tang Zhao's status, but rather because of his actions.\"No need to be so polite.\" Tang Zhao laughed loudly. \"Kid, I really like you, are you willing \u2026?\"\"Your Highness, please wait for a moment. I will give him the final reward.\"He pulled Tang Huan forward a few steps, but did not mention anything about the rewards, and laughed out loud instead, \"Tang Huan, in this competition, your performance is not bad, are you willing to follow me back to Heavenly Forging City, I will personally recommend you to the Pavilion Master and accept you as my last disciple?\"When he said this, the entire stage immediately quieted down.Many of the artificers who had just received their prizes had expressions of astonishment on their faces. The Pavilion Master of the Divine Armament Hall, who was said to be a Tools Refining Great Master, Master Gu Yi actually wanted to recommend Tang Huan to the Master's disciple?After the short period of shock, countless murderous gazes fell on Tang Huan. Only Tang Yun and Mo Ye were still relatively calm, but their eyes were also filled with unconcealable astonishment.\"Gu Yi, you've gone too far. How dare you sneak attack us like this.\"Tang Zhen came to his senses and immediately looked furious. With a single step, he rushed to Gu Yi's side. His eyes were as wide as bells and spittle splashed all over Gu Yi's face.\"What is Your Highness saying? I don't understand. \"Gu Yi wiped his face and looked at Tang Zhao with a puzzled expression. When he turned to look at Tang Huan, his gaze became a little anxious, \"Tang Huan, to be able to have a Tools Refining Great Master as a disciple is a great fortune. Furthermore, among all the Tools Refining Great Master, the Pavilion Master is unquestionably the best in the world!\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: 64As soon as he finished speaking, Gu Yi looked at Tang Huan with a face full of smiles. He thought that no young refiner would be able to resist such a temptation, of course, in a situation where Tang Zhao didn't have the time to say what he wanted to say. To seize the initiative was far too important.He wanted to give this kid a preconceived impression. If Tang Zhao said anything more, the temptation would plummet.\"I'm sorry, Grandmaster Gu Yi, I already have a master.\"Tang Huan looked at Tang Zhao in confusion, then shook his head.It was undeniable that when he suddenly heard Gu Yi's words, his heart had indeed been moved. He was very clear on what the two titles Divine Armament Hall's Pavilion Master and Tools Refining Great Master represented in this world.But in the next moment, Tang Huan did not have that kind of thought.If the Grandmaster medallion and smithing manual really belonged to the old blacksmith Ou Xie, his master would probably be the Tools Refining Great Master now. Of course, more importantly, after inheriting the youth's memories, he also inherited the youth's feelings for the old blacksmith.Therefore, Tang Huan rejected her without hesitation.\"What?\"Gu Yi was immediately dumbfounded. Wu Xin, Mu Kui, Qing Ye and the others also looked at each other in dismay. As for the surrounding Ocean Leviathan, Lu Li, Gu Jingcheng and the other young artificers, they found it even more unbelievable. Was this Tang Huan a fool? Gu Yi was the one who wanted to recommend him to the Divine Armament Hall Lord.That person was the number one Tools Refining Great Master in the world!Even if he were to reject the offer, at least he should think about it for a moment longer!In that moment, all the young refiners scolded Tang Huan until he was a dog that was about to die. They all wished that they could replace Tang Huan and nodded in agreement.Did this guy know what sort of opportunity he had missed?\"Okay, okay, then what's there to go to, Heavenly Forging City and Divine Armament Hall?\"After being stunned for a short moment, Tang Zhao instead laughed heartily. \"Kid, let me tell you, our Great Tang Empire's God-down City is \u2026\"\"Tang Huan, think it over carefully.\"Gu Yi came to his senses and hastily interrupted Tang Zhao. He was so anxious that his words were immediately a bit sloppy. \"Your teacher, I also know that he's just an old blacksmith. Allegedly, he's just a low-ranked artificer?\" Tang Huan, with your talent, how can you be your master? \"Wu Xin did not think much upon hearing this, but Qing Ye and Mu Kui's expressions changed slightly as they thought to themselves, This is bad.\"Master Gu Yi, whether or not Divine Armament Hall Lord is the number one artificer in the world has nothing to do with me. Even though that old blacksmith is only a low level artificer, he raised me up to be like a son to him, and I treat him like a father. Perhaps his strength is weak, and his level of artificing is not even on par with Divine Armament Hall Lord's, but he is still the only master that I, Tang Huan, have ever had in my life.\"\"Good!\" Good! \"Well said!\"Initially, Tang Zhao was extremely displeased to be interrupted by Gu Yi, but now that he heard Tang Huan's words, he felt extremely comfortable. Looking at this kid, he felt even more pleasing to the eye and laughed loudly, \"People can't forget their roots. Brat, This King likes you even more! \"At this time, Gu Yi also knew that he had said the wrong thing. He opened his mouth, wanting to explain something, but in the end, it turned into a helpless, bitter laugh. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"He, Wu Xin, Mu Kui, and Qing Ye already knew that it would be completely hopeless to bring Tang Huan into Heavenly Forging City.Of course, they could also forcefully bring Tang Huan away.However, that way, it would run counter to their original intentions. In the future, even if Tang Huan's achievements were astonishing, they would not have any good impressions of him.Not far away, Tang Tianren, who hadn't approached, had a wooden face. It was unknown what she was thinking.Gu Jingcheng and Lu Li couldn't help but look at each other and sigh.If there was this Tang Huan, given the time, the Tang Family could easily expand its power by ten times, but it was fortunate that this was the case, if not, how could the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City have a place for the Gu Family and the Lu Family to have a foothold in the future?\"Brat, come to our God-down City.\"Tang Zhao laughed loudly. \"Although my Great Tang Imperial Family doesn't have the title of the number one Tools Refining Great Master, but there's still a Tools Refining Great Master like that. Kid, there is no need for you to take me as your master once you go to the God-down City. After the ancestor of our imperial family finds out about your situation, he will be very happy to guide you. \"As he finished speaking, Tang Zhao glanced complacently at Gu Yi, Wu Xin, and the others.The Divine Armament Hall had delivered the opportunity himself. Without the interference of the Divine Armament Hall, it would be much easier for the Imperial Family to recruit this genius.Tang Yun was also beaming with joy as she nodded her head repeatedly, with a trace of anticipation on her beautiful face. As long as he went to the God-down City, he would be able to frequently find him to spar with him. Who knows? A few meters away, when Mo Ye heard this, she frowned. If Tang Huan agrees to recruit her, there was a high chance that there would be two Tools Refining Great Master s in the future who would appear within the royal family of the Tang Nation.\"I thank Your Highness for your kindness, but I temporarily do not have any plans to leave the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City.\"Tang Huan said somewhat helplessly.Famous in the \"Weapon Refining Competition\", there were pros and cons. To others, the recruitment of Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family was naturally of immense benefit. But to Tang Huan, this was one of the disadvantages. Based on his current situation, if he wanted to leave the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, he would have to bring the remnant \"Divine Tools Catalogue\" with him. However, facing a Tools Refining Great Master that was bound to be the Stage Nine Martial Saint, he had no confidence in keeping his secret.Once the remnant atlas was discovered, he reckoned that there would be a fatal disaster. If he didn't have the map fragments, he wouldn't mind going to the God-down City.\"Huh?\"Tang Zhao and Tang Yun's smiles stiffened as Gu Yi and the rest were also stunned. They thought that Tang Huan would definitely throw himself into the imperial family's embrace, but unexpectedly, Tang Huan actually rejected them as well. The others looked at each other and let out sighs of relief. A smile appeared in their eyes.\"Kid, don't be in such a hurry to refuse.\"Tang Zhe rubbed his hands together in a bit of a hurry and rolled his eyes. \"Come with me.\" Without further ado, he pulled Tang Huan over ten meters away, wrapped his arms around Tang Huan's shoulders, and pointed at Tang Yun quietly. \"Brat, what do you think about my niece?\"\"She's very beautiful and very cute, and her refining level is also very high. In the future, she will at least be a Master Refiner.\" Tang Huan was startled and looked at him in puzzlement, but she still praised him.\"Good eye.\"Tang Zhao chuckled. \"In the future, my niece will definitely be the Empress of the Tang Dynasty. If you follow me to God-down City, I'll request for my royal brother to betroth her to you. In the future, you'll be the empress's husband, and at that time, you'll be below one person and above tens of thousands.\"This little fellow was no ordinary weapons crafting genius, so he was completely worthy of placing such a heavy bet.Everyone knew that it was one thing for the four physiques of the Martial Warriors to not become an artificer. However, once they became an artificer, their achievements would very likely surpass the average artificer of the five elements, especially the metal element and the water element.Tang Huan was a metal of the five elements, his future was limitless.[] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: 65Was he trying to court the little princess?Tang Huan was slightly dumbstruck. When Tang Zhao pulled him over, he'd thought that Tang Zhao would agree on something. He didn't expect that it would be something like this.\"Are you interested?\"When this trump card was revealed, he was afraid that this brat would not obey obediently. The Prince Consort of the Great Tang Empire, the future empress' husband, would all have obtained such an identity, power, status, and beautiful women.\"I am indeed tempted.\"Tang Huan nodded honestly, and looked away.The little girl was obviously very curious about what the two were talking about. She blinked her pair of dark eyeballs, looking very cute.He had to admit that this girl was very beautiful, and her figure was also very impressive. However, when he thought about her current age, Tang Huan couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. She was fourteen or fifteen years old, still a carefree junior high student in her previous life, and even though his body was only sixteen years old and matched up to her well, his mental age was already in its thirties. This kind of feeling was a little strange.Of course, the age difference wasn't the most important. Right now he was fourteen or fifteen years old, and in a few years he would be in his twenties. When that time came, the uncomfortable feeling would naturally disappear.The most important thing was that although the identity of Prince Consort of the Tang Kingdom and Empress husband brought about an enticing power and status, Tang Huan did not want to become a slave with power and status.\"Alright, then we'll \u2026\"But before he could finish his words, Tang Huan couldn't help but say, \"Your Highness, Your Highness, although my heart is moved, I still want to stay in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City. Moreover, Your Highness has decided the life and death of the Little Princess so quickly, whether she is willing or not is known.\"\"Brat, you are really stupid.\"\"Little girl, what do you know now? Play with her for a few days first. It's best if you lose to her a few times during the refining competition and coax her into being happy. Then, you'll naturally be treated as her good friend.\"\"Thank you for your kind intentions Your Highness, I still prefer to stay in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City.\" Tang Huan said with gratitude.\"This King is wasting my breath. Boy, then will you go to the God-down City?\" Tang Zhao was slightly angry at this moment. His face tensed up, and his eyes glared as his voice sunk. An exceptionally terrifying aura immediately swept out from his robust body and pressed down towards Tang Huan.\"No!\" Tang Huan's heart trembled, but he still slowly but firmly shook his head.\"You \u2026\"Tang Zhao was even more enraged. A berserk aura rippled out, as if a hurricane had been set off around him.Gu Yi, Wu Xin, and the others were all shocked.However, just as they were about to surround him, Tang Zhao saw that Tang Huan didn't move in the slightest, and his powerful aura suddenly vanished completely. He said in a discouraged voice, \"Brat, you have guts! Alright \u2026I won't force you. If you change your mind in the future, you can come to the God-down City to find me at any time. \"\"Thank you, Your Highness.\" Tang Huan also laughed.\"Thank my ass!\"Tang Zhao's eyes bulged as he glared at Tang Huan. He cupped his hands towards the crowd and said, \"Everyone, this king will take his leave now. Girl, let's go!\" Being unable to recruit Tang Huan made him very depressed, and he did not have the mood to continue staying on the stage.After he finished speaking, he waved his hand and walked down the stage.It was obvious that Tang Yun was disappointed that he didn't succeed in persuading Tang Zhao. He quickly ran to catch up, but when he passed the edge of the stage, he couldn't help but turn his head and say in a clear voice. \"Tang Huan, don't forget the 'Tools Method Holy Assembly'.\"\"Don't worry, I won't forget.\"Tang Huan nodded and smiled.Tang Yun's face revealed a cheerful smile, and ran down the stairs. The armored elder also followed up with a wooden tray in his hand, and when he passed by Tang Huan, he smiled meaningfully.\"Grandmaster Gu Yi, Grandmaster Wu Xin, and everyone else, I'll be taking my leave as well.\"The Ocean Leviathan also cupped its hands towards the crowd with a smile on its face before looking towards Tang Huan and saying, \"Little brother, if you need any forged weapons for sale or if you need some relatively rare refining materials, you can come to the Starsea Weapon Shop at any time. In this Honor Continent, there are not many refining materials that my Star Sea Merchant Guild can find. \"\"Alright, then I'll thank the owner first. Perhaps in the future, I'll trouble the owner a lot.\" Tang Huan also cupped his hands in respect, \"Also, thank you shopkeeper for your share of True Fire.\"\"A portion of true fire is not worth mentioning. Besides, that's what you deserve.\"After the Ocean Leviathan left with a smile on its face, Gu Jingcheng, Lu Li, and Tang Tianren also took their leave. The first two exchanged a few pleasantries with Tang Huan, but the latter didn't even glance at him, as if he had not noticed Tang Huan's existence.Following that, the young equipment forgers also carried their prizes down the platform one by one.Mo Ye looked at Tang Huan and his lips slightly moved, as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he turned into a light snort and arrogantly left.Tang Huan smiled in his heart, and did not mind.Others might think that he had rejected Mo Ye's good intentions, but he could tell that this Grand Princess Mo Yun must have some sort of ulterior motive in coming to him. Moreover, it was very possible that it was related to the Second Prince of the Sharon Empire.In the blink of an eye, he had already turned to look at Gu Yi, Wu Xin, Mu Kui and Qing Ye. Tang Huan was about to leave, but Gu Yi suddenly stepped forward and said apologetically: \"Little brother, I was too anxious just now, please forgive me. However, I do not have any intention of belittling your master.\"\"Master, you don't have to worry about it. I was just overreacting.\"Gu Yi was the previous Pavilion Master of the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, and also a Master Refiner. For him to be able to put down his status and make an apology like this, Tang Huan would naturally not fuss over it. He had always been mindful of his negligence, and furthermore, Gu Yi was the idol of this youth, Tang Huan, in the past.\"The champion of this year's competition will also receive a reward.\"Upon seeing this, Gu Yi also smiled, and a yellow parchment paper appeared in his hand, about the size of two palms. There seemed to be some black lines on it, \"Little brother, this is the reward, from now on, it is yours.\"With that, Gu Yi handed the parchment paper over.\"This is \u2026\"Not mentioning Gu Yi, Tang Huan had almost forgotten about this matter. He subconsciously took it over and took a look, but he couldn't help but be a little dazed. \"This is a map?\"\"Exactly.\"Gu Yi had a smile between his brows as he said slowly, \"This is something that I discovered from the notes of a late master in Divine Armament Hall. It should be the hiding place of a kind of 'Spiritual Fire'. According to the records of the master, it should be one of the five great Spiritual Fire s, the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire'. Moreover, according to the map, the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire' should be located at the Origin Continent's' Feng Ming Mountain '! \"\"Five Great Spiritual Fire s?\" Nirvana Sacred Fire '? \" was stunned upon hearing it. Wu Xin, Mu Kui and Qing Ye were also a little dazed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: 66Back in his room on the fifth floor of the restaurant, Shan Shan let out a light sigh, as a faint smile appeared on his face.If he obtained the position of the champion of the Weapon Refining Competition, there would definitely be a great power that would try to recruit him. If he did not have a strong background, it was very possible that he would offend the other party if he refused.Of course, when recruiting, those great powers were very willing to give up their capital, especially towards those young artificers with especially astonishing potential. The things they offered were extremely attractive, and under normal circumstances, if the chief himself didn't belong to a certain force, he wouldn't refuse.She had noticed the commotion on the platform just now.Although he could not hear what they were saying, he could guess one or two things from their actions. After the rewards were given out, it should be the Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family that continuously recruited Tang Huan.If Tang Huan was just an ordinary young artificer, agreeing to their recruitment wouldn't be inappropriate.However, Tang Huan possessed the \"Divine Tools Catalogue's scroll\", so if he were to accept the invitation and reveal the secret, it was very possible that it would immediately lead to disaster. Even if there was only a single page of the Divine Tools Catalogue's remnant scroll, it would still attract the coveting of countless experts, not to mention that Tang Huan possessed an entire five pages.The good thing was that from the movements over there, Tang Huan had probably rejected it.Although she didn't know what kind of offer the Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family had made, with Tang Huan's performance in the \"Artifact Forging Competition\", it was definitely not low, and it was difficult for him to resist the temptation.\"Not good, I have to hurry back. Don't let this bastard discover that I've slipped out.\"Seeing that Tang Huan was walking down the stage, Shan Shan was startled. He immediately stood up and ran out of the private room, the sound of his footsteps got weaker and weaker.\"Brother Gu, you actually gave away one of the five great Spiritual Fire's, the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire'.\"On the high platform, Wu Xin could not help but shake his head and sigh as he watched Tang Huan's departing figure. Mu Kui and Qing Ye's eyes were filled with amazement.They all knew very well that the special reward that they had originally prepared for the competition's chief was for Master Gu Yi to personally forge a top-grade and medium-grade weapon that was suitable for refiners. He never expected that Gu Yi would change his mind and send the map of the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\" out at the very last moment.\"My talent is limited, to become a Master Refiner is already my limit. Even if I obtain the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire', it's impossible for me to successfully fuse it. If the map is of no use to me, I might as well give it to this little fellow.\"Gu Yi lightly stroked his long beard and slowly said, \"Moreover, giving him a map, to you, is difficult to predict whether it will be a blessing or a curse. If he is able to successfully fuse with the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire', perhaps he will be able to become a Tools Refining Great Master by the age of thirty. Naturally, this would be our Human Clan's great fortune, but if he fails \u2026 \"As he spoke up to this point, Gu Yi sighed softly and frowned slightly.Wu Xin, Mu Kui, and Qing Ye fell into silence upon hearing this. Although Gu Yi did not say it out loud, the meaning behind his words was extremely clear.Speaking from this point of view, the map that he had given Tang Huan the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\" was indeed a good thing or a bad thing.When the four of them were silent, the crowd had mostly dispersed. Then, a large group of young men began to enter the square to clean up the mess. At this point, the \"Weapon Refining Competition\", which had gathered thousands of young refiners from all over the continent, had completely come to an end.However, the effects of the tournament had already begun to ferment.\"What?\" That Tang Huan obtained the lead representative of the 'Artifact Forging Competition'? Are you sure it's that little bastard? \"In a quiet courtyard in the western part of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, a sharp voice suddenly rang.The one who spoke was a richly dressed woman around the age of 27 or 28. She had a oval face, red phoenix eyes, beautiful looks, and a mature and slim figure. At this moment, she stared blankly at the old man with grey hair, her face filled with disbelief.This woman was the Tang Family Patriarch, Tang Tianren's main wife, Mei Xin!\"It's indeed him!\" The old man bowed slightly, his expression dark.\"Hateful!\" Hateful! That little bastard is actually getting more and more popular. \"Moments later, Mei Xin's shock was replaced by an unconcealable anger. \"The five people that Tang Tian Shi chose are all trash and have yet to return. Maybe they all died in the forest of the secret realm. Uncle Lin, that nephew of yours is also a piece of trash. He was actually scared senseless and still hasn't recovered from it even now. If that little bastard were to die in the 'Secret Realm Forest,' things like today would never happen again. \"Uncle Lin slightly lowered his head, not saying a word. He could only bitterly smile.Mei Xin was so angry that her chest heaved up and down. \"If we obtain the position of the champion of this tournament, we will be recruited by others. Uncle Lin, do you know which family will be the one to recruit him?\"\"I heard that the Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family recruited him before, and invited him to go to the Heavenly Forging City and the God-down City. Unfortunately, he rejected them all!\" When he heard this news, he was also shocked. There was actually someone who continuously rejected Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family's recruitment?\"Reject? Is there something wrong with that little bastard's head? \"Mei Xin froze for a moment. Clearly, something unexpected had happened, but right after, she sneered and said, \"Reject well!\" Reject! If he does not reject us, after we go to Heavenly Forging City or Fallen God City, we will be at a loss of what to do to him. But now, there is a chance for us to make a move. \"She paused for a moment before gritting her teeth and saying, \"Uncle Lin, you have to think of a way to get rid of this person. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep or eat in peace!\"\"Yes, this old servant understands.\" Lin Bo slightly bowed.\"Where's the Patriarch? But we're back! \" A sarcastic smile appeared on Mei Xin's face as she continued, \"Seeing those vile seeds of yours be the chief of the 'Blacksmith's Competition', they must be suffering from a bad taste, right?\"\"The moment the Patriarch returned, he was summoned by the Old Ancestor.\" Uncle Lin quickly said.\"That old thing, why didn't he close his doors and cultivate his skills, why did he suddenly appear out of nowhere?\" Hearing this, Mei Xin frowned.\"Madam, please be careful.\" Uncle Lin was startled.\"What are you afraid of!\"However, Mei Xin snorted in disapproval.At this time, in the depths of the Tang Family compound, Tang Tianren was walking into a simple and ancient small hall. Not long after, a vigorous voice came out from inside: \"Tian Ren, I heard that the Tang Huan who obtained the position of 'Artifact Forging Competition' this time is your illegitimate child?\"\"Grandfather, you know about it?\"Tang Tianren's expression was extremely respectful.Opposite him was a haggard old man in white, his face wrinkled as if he had stepped into a coffin.\"How could I not know about such an important matter?\"The white clothed old man snorted, \"My Tang Clan has been in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City for more than a hundred years, but there has never been a clan Disciples who has been out there. Tianzhen, you have handled this matter too inappropriately. How can you abandon your son because of the woman's words? Go and invite Tang Huan back to the Tang Family, no matter what you do. \"\"Grandfather, this \u2026 This \u2026 \"I'm afraid that it won't do \u2026\" Tang Tianren's face changed.\"Why not?\"The white-robed old man's eyes suddenly became sharp.Tang Tianren lowered his head, hesitated for a moment, but in the end he gritted his teeth and said: \"Grandfather, actually this Tang Huan is not a \u2026..\"\u2026 \u2026.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: 67\"Is he drunk?\"North of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, inside a smithy, slept soundly while sprawled out on his stomach. Tang Huan couldn't help but laugh and cry.little one was an alcoholic. When there was wine, he drank it all, and when he drank it all he got drunk.\"Strange, I've already poured out all the wine at home, where can I find wine to drink? You didn't take it with you, did you? \" Tang Huan looked at Shan Shan suspiciously.\"Where?\" Maybe it found you before you poured it all out. \"Shan Shan immediately denied with a little guilt, and then asked while knowing the answer, \"Oh yes, what number did you get this time, and what reward did you get?\"Tang Huan had originally only asked casually, but upon hearing that, he chuckled: \"First place!\"\"Wow, how amazing!\"Shan Shan exclaimed, \"You actually got first place in the competition!\"Looking at her exaggerated expression, Tang Huan was startled, and then looking at little one whose stomach was bulging, he suddenly realized, and unhappily curled his lips: \"Alright, alright, stop pretending, your acting skills are really too tragic. You must have seen the end of this' Artifact Forging Competition 'from the beginning to end.\"\"How do you know?\" Being exposed by Tang Huan, Shan Shan could not help but blush slightly.\"If you didn't see it, and know that I've obtained first place, you would definitely say it, it's just that, what's so great about being first place in the Weapon Refining Competition, if you have the ability then you can take first place in the Tools Method Sacred Assembly!\"Tang Huan imitated Shan Shan's expression and coldly snorted. After saying that, a hint of a confident smile appeared on Tang Huan's face, \"The champion of the 'Artifact Forging Competition' is only the first step. In another two years, I might really go to Heavenly Forging City to get the head of the 'Tools Method Sacred Assembly'.\"\"Aren't you afraid of breaking your cowhide?\" Shan Shan no longer had to pretend. He could only snort coldly, identical to the expression that Tang Huan had imitated just now.\"Then you just wait and see.\"Tang Huan squinted his eyes and smiled, then changed the topic, \"Shan Shan, do you know of the five great 'Spiritual Fire', can you explain it to me in detail?\"\"Of course I know. Why are you asking this?\" Shan Shan was startled, but still said, \"The 'Spiritual Fire' is a flame that is even stronger than the 'True Fire'.\"All the artificers of our Honor Continent and Origin Continent, the first 'True Fire' that we fused with, is from the 'True Fire Pool' of the 'Sword-forging Valley.\"\"That 'True Fire Pond' has existed for countless years. No matter how the world changes, the flames have never extinguished. It is said that this is because a peerless expert of the ancient era was able to cultivate a huge fire seed, and thus produced a 'True Fire' that will never go out. \"\"But the 'Spiritual Fire' is different. It is a type of flame that is naturally formed.\"\"Different 'Spiritual Fire' have different characteristics. When forging a weapon, one can display certain characteristics of the weapon to an extremely terrifying degree. Every single 'Spiritual Fire' in this world has existed for a long time, and in these long years, they have already given birth to a strong spirit. \"\"It's precisely because of this that fusing with the 'Spiritual Fire' is so difficult. Since ancient times, there have been countless refiners who have attempted to fuse with the 'Spiritual Fire', but the majority of them have already lost their souls, and only a few have succeeded.\"So that's how it is.\" Tang Huan slowly nodded, and then could not help but ask, \"In that hundred years, did any artificer successfully integrate with the 'Spiritual Fire'?\"\"Probably not.\"Shan Shan thought for a moment before shaking his head, and said, \"The 'Spiritual Fire' is different from the 'True Fire' in the 'True Fire Pond'. Since it has a strong spirit, it would not stay in the same place for thousands of years. Of course, it is also possible that some artificers may discover his whereabouts and keep it a secret. \"\"Then how many more 'Spiritual Fire' exist within the continents of this world?\" Tang Huan asked doubtfully.\"There have always been only five.\"Shan Shan laughed and said, \"In ancient times, even though there were a few refiners who successfully fused with the 'Spiritual Fire', after they died, the 'Spiritual Fire' would leave their body and return to the world. Therefore, the total number of 'Spiritual Fire' has never changed. \"After saying that, Shan Shan laughed out of curiosity: \"Tang Huan, you ignorant fool, why are you suddenly interested in the 'Spiritual Fire'?\"Tang Huan was silent for a moment, before he finally focused on Shan Shan and said: \"I've obtained the 'Spiritual Fire', this kind of hidden location map '!\"\"What?\"Shan Shan was shocked, but immediately she realised, \"I understand, the champion's special prize is precisely this!\"Instantly, Shan Shan's expression became extremely solemn. \"Tang Huan, I advise you not to look for the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire'. Even though it is incomparably precious, it is also incomparably dangerous. For countless years, there have been countless genius artificers who suffered from backlash after fusing with the Spiritual Fire, causing their souls to scatter. \"\"If I really die because of the fusion of the 'Nirvana Sacred Fire', then my death would also be worth it.\"Hearing this, Tang Huan couldn't help but laugh.If she had heard that Shan Shan had a map of the location where the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\" was hidden, she would have immediately asked him to take a look, or ask him where the map was pointing. Tang Huan might even suspect her motives, but the first thing she did was advise him not to look for the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\".However, Shan Shan's persuasion did not waver Tang Huan's plans in the slightest.Of course, the reason he was so sure was because of the existence of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", allowing him to have more confidence in merging with the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\".\"You \u2026\"Shan Shan's beautiful face revealed a look of anger, she was clearly infuriated by his reply.Tang Huan's smile faded as he said slowly: \"The location indicated on the map is Feng Ming Mountain!\"\"Feng Ming Mountain?\"Hearing this, Shan Shan did not care about being angry, and shouted out in surprise.\"Your reaction seems to be a little too big.\"Seeing that, Tang Huan could not help but laugh.Shan Shan rolled his eyes fiercely at Tang Huan and snorted, \"Do you know that one of the eight Demon Kings under the Devil Lord Fen Tian's command, 'Fire Wing Phoenix King', might very well be hiding inside Feng Ming Mountain right now? Furthermore, that 'Fire Wing Phoenix King' might very well have a page or two of the 'Divine Tools Catalogue' s remnant scrolls on his body.\"\"Fire Wing Phoenix King?\"Tang Huan secretly took a deep breath, then his eyes lit up, \"Since she has the 'Divine Tools Catalogue' remnant, then 'Feng Ming Mountain' is even more appropriate.\"\"However, Fire Wing Phoenix King is the same as the Howling Firmament Wolf King, they are equivalent to the level eight Martial Saint of humanity. With my current strength, the chances of me seizing the 'Divine Tools Catalogue's' remnant scroll from her is practically zero. If I were to accidentally get hit by her, I might even lose my life.\"Shan Shan scoffed, \"You don't have to worry about that, the 'Fire Wing Phoenix King' was severely injured in the war against the 'Plain between Two Continents', and the only way to return to Feng Ming Mountain is to go recuperate from your injuries.\"\"She's hurt too?\"Tang Huan was pleasantly surprised.Looking at his expression, Shan Shan could tell what he was thinking. He said with a cold smile, \"Why do you think the 'Fire Wing Phoenix King' is able to return to Feng Ming Mountain after being heavily injured? If she was found out so easily, all of us human Rankers would have already killed our way up Feng Ming Mountain and killed her off! \"\"Well, how do I find out that you seem to know everything? You even know about the secret news of the Fire Wing Phoenix King at Feng Ming Mountain? \" Tang Huan laughed dryly.\"I don't know everything. You are just too ignorant.\" Shan Shan's beautiful eyes flickered slightly, but she covered it up well. She pursed her red lips in disdain, \"As long as you know who the 'Fire Wing Phoenix King' is, you can roughly guess where she is right now.\"\"...\"[] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: 68Although he already had five pages of the \"Divine Tools Catalogue\" fragment, Tang Huan still didn't know a thing about how to forge a Divine Armament. In this regard, he was not surprised at all. If the current him could forge a Divine Armament, then the Divine Armament in this world would have been as worthless as weeds by the side of the road.However, even though he was unable to forge a Divine Armament, Tang Huan was still extremely interested in the \"Divine Tools Catalogue\" remnant scrolls. This was entirely due to his hobbies from his previous life.From Shan Shan's words, he found out that \"Fire Wing Phoenix King\" was most likely to have the fragment atlas, but he didn't rashly head towards the Origin Continent immediately.He had a lot to do before he left.First, was naturally to use the \"Blazing Heart Stone\" left behind by Ou Xie to forge a middle ranked weapon for himself. But before he could truly fight, he had to first use a few middle ranked weapons to practice.After lunch, Tang Huan started to busy himself in the smithy.There was a strict dividing line between mid-grade weapons and low-grade weapons.Low-tier weapons only needed to select a good time, smeared the gemstone juice on it, and then fuse it together again. For mid-tier weapons, one must use the gemstone solution to draw the outline of \"Spirit Map\" on the tool slab, in order to maximize the power of the gemstone. This was the most important thing, next, the fusion of mid-tier weapons required two types of gemstones.It was because of this reason that although Tang Huan had used two gems to forge the long spear he had forged with the \"Jadeite Tiny Stone\" and the \"Red Rainbow Stone\", it did not have the outline of a \"Spirit Map\". It could only be considered a low level weapon.\"Dingdang!\" Ding! \"Clang \u2026\"In the smithy, Tang Huan's upper body was bared, and he was sweating profusely as he hammered \"Black Profound Iron\" non-stop.After two or three months, not only had Tang Huan become more robust, he had also grown a lot taller.Unknowingly, the sun had already set in the west, and the rays of light were as magnificent as blood.\"Hmm?\"Tang Huan seemed to have suddenly noticed something, and looked towards the outside of the store, where five figures were walking in.Seeing the five people, Tang Huan was slightly startled, but immediately after, he smiled, but there was no smile in his eyes.Among the five, other than Black Costume Old Man, the other people were all Tang Huan's \"old friends\" \u2014 Tang Chao, Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie. However, these four \"old friends\" all had extremely strange expressions on their faces, as if they had been raped and humiliated.\"This old man, Tang Tian De, shall be the Tang Family's steward, and you shall be Tang Huan?\" When they reached the shop, the Black Costume Old Man smiled and said with a gentle voice.\"Exactly.\"Tang Huan smirked, \"What can I do for you?\"Black Costume Old Man slightly nodded, but in the next moment, his face darkened and shouted at Tang Chao and the others with a stern expression: \"rascal! Hurry up and apologize to Tang Huan! \"Hearing this, the shame and anger on Tang Chao and Tang Hong's faces intensified.\"Tang Huan, I'm sorry, I was wrong. I shouldn't have come to find trouble with you.\" Tang Chao took a deep breath in the end and forced out a smile on his face as he apologized to Tang Huan. However, when he spoke, his hands were already tightly clenched, and his knuckles were white.With Tang Chao leading the way, Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Jun Jie also apologized one after the other. Their expressions were ugly, as if they had swallowed everything that they had pulled out from their butts.\"I see.\"Tang Huan suddenly laughed, \"Tang Tian De, are you here to invite me back to the Tang Family?\"First, he had activated the twelve-meter totem flames with his physique which belonged to the metal element, and then displayed astonishing potential during the \"Artifact Forging Competition\". Furthermore, he had won the support of the Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family, so it was impossible for the Tang Family to ignore this, but who had come up with this idea?\"That's right.\"However, he soon sighed with a sincere expression, and said: \"Tang Huan, in these dozen years, our Tang Family has been shaming ourselves against you and your mother. I hope you can give the Tang Family a chance to make amends.\"Sure enough, a mocking smile surfaced on Tang Huan's face. \"Tang Tiande, it's easy if you want me to return. You only need to agree to three conditions.\"\"Speak!\" This old man can make the decision for most things! \" Tang Tiande said with a smile on his face.\"First, let that woman from the Tang Clan, Mei Xin, come personally and kneel down to invite me!\" Tang Huan said with a smile.\"What?\"When Tang Tiande heard this, his expression abruptly changed.Tang Chao, Tang Hong, Tang Jiang and Tang Junjie also looked at Tang Huan with abnormally shocked expressions. Mei Xin was the wife of the Patriarch, yet Tang Huan actually wanted her to kneel and invite her in?\"Secondly, get Tang Tianren and Mei Xin to kowtow in front of my mother's grave to apologize!\" Tang Huan smiled again.\"You \u2026\"Tang Tiande's expression was even more unsightly. Tang Chao and the others were completely dumbfounded.Tang Huan ignored the expressions of the five and continued, \"Thirdly, ask Tang Tianren to divorce Mei Xin and arrange a wedding in front of my mother's grave. Marry my mother as the legal wife!\"\"You, you \u2026\"Tang Tiande was so angry that his entire body was trembling. This little scoundrel wanted Mei Xin to kneel down and beg for forgiveness, but he also wanted the clan head to kowtow in front of the grave. Even more outrageously, this little scoundrel wanted the clan head to divorce his wife and take her as his wife![What the hell?\"If the Tang Clan can fulfill these three conditions, then I will naturally be a Disciples of the Tang Clan?\" Tang Huan looked at Tang Tiande, his face full of smiles.\"Tang Huan, this is impossible!\" Tang Tiande took a deep breath and spoke with a dark expression as he suppressed the urge to smack the smiling face of his opponent until it exploded.\"Since it's impossible, then scram.\" Tang Huan sneered and curled his lips.\"In terms of seniority, this old man is still your clan uncle! You. How dare you speak to me like that? \" Tang Tiande's face was gloomy, and he was unable to contain his anger.\"Uncle?\" Tang Tiande, you think too highly of yourself. In my opinion, you are just an old dog of Tang Jia's. \" Tang Huan squinted his eyes and laughed.\"How dare you!\"Tang Tiande, as the head steward of the Tang Clan, had always had a great reputation in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City. When had he ever been humiliated like this? He took a step forward and slightly raised his right fist. An extremely enormous aura whizzed out from his body, pressing towards Tang Huan with the force of a landslide.\"You dare to attack?\" Tang Huan stood straight, fearless. Inside his dantian, the cauldron was revolving, causing the impact of the aura on him to almost be nil.\"You \u2026\"Tang Tiande paused in his actions, his mind immediately calming down from his anger. Indeed, he did not dare make a move. This Tang Huan was no longer the same Tang Huan as before. Not only was he a low-ranked Divine Inscriptionist, he had also obtained the champion of the \"Artifact Forging Competition\", as well as the support of the Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family.If he were to make a move in Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, it would most likely cause a huge trouble for the Tang Clan.\"Let's go! Tang Huan, you better behave! \"Tang Tiande lowered his fist and swept a cold glance at Tang Huan before he turned around and left. Tang Chao and the others followed behind, as if they had just woken up from a dream.[] [Table of Contents] Everyone quickly received a 0.

    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: 69\"Tang Huan, your three conditions are really harsh, the Tang Family will definitely not agree.\" Shan Shan's beautiful voice sounded out from behind him.\"Of course I know that the Tang Clan would not agree. However, since you said the conditions are harsh, I don't think so.\"Tang Huan laughed.However, it was a pity that before he could even realize his wish, he was beaten to death by Tang Hong and those bastards. However, when he died, Tang Huan used his body to live on.Naturally, Tang Huan would help to realize his wish.However, compared to the three conditions that Tang Huan had mentioned, the Tang Clan's actions were even more loathsome. If it wasn't for his good luck, coupled with the great increase in his strength, he might have been burnt to ashes that day in the \"Confusion Forest\".\"But, what if the Tang Clan really agrees?\" Shan Shan could not help but ask again.\"If the Tang Clan can really fulfill the three conditions I mentioned \u2026\"A cold glint flashed past Tang Huan's eyes.He had yet to think about Shan Shan's problem, furthermore, the possibility of such a thing happening was not something that Shan Shan had mentioned. The origin of Mei Xin was not that simple, Tang Tianren definitely would not dare to let her go, otherwise, the Tang Family would definitely meet with trouble.\u2026 \u2026.\"rascal! This rascal! \"In the Tang Clan Assembly Hall, a low roar suddenly echoed. Tang Tianren's face was ashen as he smacked the armrest of his chair to pieces.Tang Tianshi, Tang Tianfeng, and the other higher-ups in the hall also had ugly expressions on their faces.Furthermore, Tang Tianshi had not settled the debt for his two sons' hard beating, and now that he was forced to apologize to Tang Huan, if he really could win Tang Huan's understanding and let him return to the clan, then that would be fine. After all, with Tang Huan's potential, he had a high possibility of becoming a Tools Refining Great Master in the future.With the Tools Refining Great Master overseeing things, the Tang Family would become a powerful clan under the heavens, and would no longer be limited to just this one small corner of the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City.But they didn't expect that the news they were waiting for was this kind of news.The first condition that Tang Huan put forward was already impossible to accomplish. Mei Xin was the daughter of a general in the Great Tang Empire and her father was extremely close to the Stage Nine Martial Saint. If Mei Xin had suffered such humiliation in the Tang Family, would her father just let it go?\"Tang Huan doesn't even want to return to the clan. Otherwise, why would he propose such unreasonable conditions?\"Tang Tian De couldn't help but smile bitterly. After he returned to the clan, he was able to control his coldness. He felt quite helpless in his heart.Now, they had finally grown up with great difficulty. Moreover, they had grown up with great difficulty, and had even become a refiner. Moreover, they had shocked everyone in the competition with a single move, and now, they were going to ask him to come back. No matter who it was, he would definitely not easily agree.\"Big brother, what should we do now?\" Tang Tianshi gritted his teeth as he spoke.\"I'll first go and report to the old ancestor. The old man will be the one to make the decision!\" Tang Tianren slowly stood up, but his face was twitching slightly.\"...\"\"Clang!\" \"Clang clang \u2026\"In the Tang Clan's quiet courtyard, several vases were swept to the ground, smashing into pieces. Mei Xin's pretty face was frozen, her eyes revealed a murderous look, and her voice was as cold as ice, \"This little bastard that deserves to be cut apart a thousand times dares to humiliate me like this. Uncle Lin, I don't want to see him live in this world for a moment longer.\"Madam, don't worry. There will be a chance soon.\"\"...\"Forget it, forget it. Since that is the case, if there is a chance, we should eliminate him. It is a pity that such a talented artificer with shocking potential is here. If he was here, our Tang Clan might be able to become a great clan of the world in ten to twenty years. In another palace in the Tang Family, a sigh sounded out, \"Tian Ren, you are really too muddleheaded. Sigh, it's fine if you don't mention it. \"\"Grandfather, with Long'er here, there is still a lot of hope for the Tang Clan.\"\"Tang Long? I hope so! \"\"...\"\u2026 \u2026.\"How hateful!\"In a luxurious guest room in a tavern in Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, Sha Tu who was quietly sitting on the bed suddenly opened his eyes. Looking at his still red and swollen right fist, he clenched his teeth and roared, \"Tang Huan, I will definitely kill you!\"Even though two days had passed, the anger in his chest was still unquenchable.As the second prince of the Sharon Empire, he had always been doted upon by his royal father, and had always lived in luxury since he was young. No one had ever dared to utter a single heavy word to him, but in the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" two days ago, it was the first time in his history that he had been ruthlessly humiliated by someone.Whenever he recalled the scene from that day, it was as if his heart was bitten by a poisonous snake, he was crazed with rage, and wished that he could immediately grab Tang Huan to vent the hatred in his heart.\"And Mo Ye, I won't let you off so easily!\"After breathing for a moment, a sinister and obscene expression appeared on Sha Tu's handsome face. \"You actually dare to come here and cause trouble for me. In half a year, the two of us will get married. When that happens, we'll see how This King will take care of you!\"When he thought of the usually arrogant and beautiful young girl being wantonly trampled upon by him, an intense pleasure emerged from the bottom of Sha Tu's heart for no reason.\"Someone, come!\" After laughing evilly to himself for a moment, Sha Tu suddenly raised his head and looked towards the door.\"Your Highness!\" Immediately, a tall man in his thirties pushed open the door and slightly bowed.\"Have you found out where that bastard is staying?\"Sha Tu said in a deep voice.The tall man laughed bitterly and shook his head: \"Your Highness, we have not found out, that person seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, he previously had no reputation in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, after all, we are from the outside world, and our manpower is limited, in addition, to avoid attracting the Divine Armament Hall's attention, we should not investigate him arrogantly.\"\"Trash!\" \"Rice Bucket!\"Sha Tu's expression instantly became gloomy. As long as that person could live for one more day, he wouldn't feel at ease. But now, he actually couldn't make any progress for two days.The tall man lowered his head, silent.\"Got it!\" We got it! \"Right at this moment, a surprised voice sounded out, following that, a black clothed man rushed to the door, \"Your Highness, I have already found out where Tang Huan lives, he is staying in a small blacksmith shop at the northern border of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City!\"As he said this, the man in black couldn't help but lower his voice and add, \"The blacksmith shop's location is extremely remote, and there are very few houses nearby. In addition, there are only two people in the blacksmith shop, and in addition to him, there is a young woman who should only be an ordinary person.\"\"Good!\" \"Very good!\"Hearing this, Sha Tu's complexion finally turned pale. \"Wu Yin, immediately arrange it. We'll do it tonight, there shouldn't be too many people around.\" That bastard is only a rank four Martial Master. You are a rank five Martial Master. You just need to bring four to five rank four Martial Masters. There is absolutely no mistake. Once you succeed, immediately meet up with me outside the city. Also, let's see how beautiful that woman is. If she's not bad, then don't kill her and just capture her. \"\"Yes sir!\" The tall man immediately bowed in response.\"...\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: 70Another evening.Inside the blacksmith shop, Tang Huan looked at the red lance in his hand with satisfaction.This spear was entirely forged from the piece of \"hematite\" obtained during the tournament. It was two meters long, and the tip and even the body of the spear were a fiery red color. The long spear's style was similar to the \"Conqueror Spear\" in the Divine Armament, however, it was far from being as complex as the \"Conqueror Spear\".Therefore, he did not need to worry about being associated with a \"Conqueror Spear.\"However, if one looked carefully, one would be able to see that within the body of the long spear, one could vaguely see numerous fine lines that were quite agile and smooth. These lines were first red and green, but when they reached the tip of the spear, they completely turned red.This is the middle level weapon 'Spirit Map'!What outlined the red Spirit Map was the \"Flaming Heart Stone\" left behind by Master Tang Huan, and the green Spirit Map was formed from the middle ranked gem \"Green Fluorite\". The low level and middle level weapons that Tang Huan had obtained at the \"Artifact Forging Competition\" were coincidentally taken to a weapon shop and exchanged for three of the more common \"Green Fluorites\".If the \"Flaming Heart Stone\" was said to be fire, then the \"Green Fluorite Stone\" would be equivalent to gasoline. If the two were to work together, it would be like adding oil to the fire, causing the flames to become even more intense.Three \"Green Fluorite\", nine \"Heart Flames Stone\", and a large piece of hematite turned into the Fire Red Long Spear in Tang Huan's hands.It was as if the old man had calculated it accurately, and the nine \"Heart Blazing Stones\" he had left behind were all used on the spearhead in the end.\"I'll just call you 'Scarlet Flame Spear'.\"Tang Huan stroked his spear with both hands and muttered to himself while smiling.Then, Tang Huan's face turned serious, the spear in his hand suddenly shook, and with a 'chi' sound, he thrusted out.In a split-second, the long spear began to shine with a brilliant light, from its body to the tip, as if red-green lights were rapidly trembling, the entire spear became overflowing with light, an extremely hot energy began to radiate from the spear, the closer it got, the hotter it became, to the point of the spear's tip, the hotter it became.\"Pah!\"The long spear was like a fire dragon as it roared forward. The instant the tip of the spear stabbed to the end, an abnormally fierce heat surged out like a volcanic eruption, and actually set off an ear-piercing explosion, as if even that small piece of air was set ablaze.Feeling the might of the spear, Tang Huan's face was filled with joy.With this \"Crimson Flame Spear\" coupled with the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" left behind by the old man, he was sure that it could unleash a power far beyond his imagination.\"Good spear!\"A beautiful female voice suddenly sounded out, \"Although it is only a middle tier weapon, but, even high tier weapons, I'm afraid it is only mediocre!\" Her voice was clear and melodious, like a pearl falling onto a jade plate.\"It's you?\"Tang Huan's heart jumped, he immediately retracted his spear and frowned.The one who had suddenly appeared was the Grand Princess Mo Ye of the Moyun Empire. She had red hair and blue eyes, dressed in a yellow skirt, slim and graceful, with a flattering look on her face, and a hint of a smile. Behind Mo Ye were two middle-aged women about forty years of age, who were as still as statues.When he suddenly saw Mo Ye, Tang Huan felt rather surprised. He had thought that she had already left the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City after the competition ended, but he did not expect that not only had she not left, she had even found this place.\"Grand Princess, what do you need me for?\" Tang Huan said in a heavy voice.\"Can't you come visit your friends if you have nothing to do?\" Mo Ye smiled lightly.\"I don't remember that we were friends.\" Tang Huan slowly said.\"If I say you're my friend, then you're my friend, regardless of whether you admit it or not!\" Mo Ye raised her brows slightly, her tone carrying an aura which could not be refused, \"Tang Huan, I came here only to remind you that you will be in great trouble tonight. If you are willing, you can come to my residence for a night. I don't want to see my friend die without a sound! \"\"Thank you, Grand Princess, for your reminder.\" Tang Huan was surprised, then smiled indifferently: \"However, how should I handle this, I do not need Your Highness to worry.\"\"Since that's the case, I won't force you. Farewell!\"Mo Ye cupped his hands together, then turned around and left without the slightest bit of procrastination. Not long later, she and the two middle-aged women had already disappeared from Tang Huan's sight.Tang Huan was greatly surprised, his brows knitted even more tightly.The image that this Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire gave him was not only arrogant, but also seemed to have a plan in mind. Tang Huan refused to believe that she came here just to remind him. However, Tang Huan was still unable to figure out what exactly she was plotting.\"Grand Princess? Could it be the Moyun Empire's Mo Ye? \" Shan Shan walked out gracefully.\"You know about it again?\" Tang Huan asked curiously.\"Who doesn't know of the chief princess of the Moyun Empire, Mo Ye?\"Shan Shan unhappily rolled his eyes at Tang Huan. \"She and the second prince of the Sharon Empire, Sha Tu, have already been set on marriage. They will be married in half a year.\"\"She's actually engaged to Shatu?\" Tang Huan was stunned.\"What did she come here to find you for?\" Shan Shan rolled his eyes at Tang Huan.\"If I say that she was subdued by my charm at the Artifact Forging Competition and fell in love with me at first sight, wanting to come over here and do good deeds before leaving Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City and give Sha Tu a green hat, would you believe me?\" Tang Huan looked at Shan Shan playfully and laughed.\"I didn't expect you to have such luck with women. Why don't I go and help you call her back so you can have a good night.\" Shan Shan's pretty face revealed a brilliant smile, but when Tang Huan heard the words she said, he could feel her gritting her teeth.\"Haha, just kidding. She's only here to warn me. I'm afraid it will be more lively tonight.\" Tang Huan immediately replied in a serious tone.\"Oh?\" Shan Shan's eyes flashed, \"Tang Family?\"\"Not necessarily.\"Tang Huan shook his head, \"The Tang Family is wary of Divine Armament Hall, even if they want to take action, they would not choose to stay in Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City. On the other hand, the Second Prince of the Sharon Empire whom they offended that day on the arena was more likely to be the one. Furthermore, Mo Ye and Sha Tu's relationship didn't seem to be very good, so the fact that she came here to warn him was more likely to be true.As he spoke till here, Tang Huan smiled again, \"Otherwise, we would be neither related nor relationship, and it would even cause her to lose face on the arena. Logically speaking, she shouldn't have come to remind me.\"\"You've humiliated her. How did you do that? Tell me!\" Hearing that, Shan Shan's interest was immediately piqued.\"That doesn't seem to be your concern right now, does it?\" Tang Huan was in a daze.\"...\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: 71The night was as dark as water.Tang Huan was dressed in black, he sat cross-legged and looked like an even more ancient statue. His body was motionless, and the two meter long Scarlet Flame Spear was placed on his legs.The distance between him and the smithy was only about ten metres, while Shan Shan and little one were hiding even further in the dense forest.Since he had received the news, Tang Huan would naturally not wait for them inside the shop to kill him.If these people were all Level 4 Martial Masters, Tang Huan would still be interested in showing up and playing with them, while trying out the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" and the newly forged middle ranked weapon \"Scarlet Flame Spear\". However, if these people were all Level 5 Martial Masters, Tang Huan would not be so foolish as to run out and find trouble with them.Tang Huan continued to circulate the \"Great Art of the Heavens and Earth\", his inside the Dantian and spirit wheel spinning at lightning speeds, the True Qi flowing through his nine great spirit veins, his senses raised to the limit, and within a radius of dozens of metres, even the slightest movement could not be hidden from her ears.Unknowingly, it was already late at night.\"Rustle, rustle \u2026\"A series of light footsteps suddenly entered his ears.When they arrived at the wall of the courtyard, the footsteps suddenly stopped. Then, a soft mutter could be heard, \"I didn't expect the two of us to arrive here first.\"\"Everyone, let's split up and move out on different routes. Naturally, there's always a way out. Let's just wait here for a while, we can act when everyone's here.\"\"That guy is also a Rank 4 Martial Master. We have to be careful. If he manages to escape, His Highness will not let us off easily.\"\"Haha, old brother, you are too cowardly. We have five Martial Masters, and Captain Wu Yin is a Grade Five Martial Master. I am afraid we won't be able to kill him.\"\"That's true. If so many of us can't handle that little guy, we can just find a rock and smash him to death.\"\"...\"Sitting at the base of the wall were two men in black, both of whom looked rather relaxed. They did not pay much attention to this mission. Five Level 4 Martial Grand Masters and one Level 5 Martial Master could deal with a sixteen-seventeen year old Level 4 Martial Master and low level weapons craftsman easily.\"I wonder what that woman looks like?\" If it's a normal situation, then there's no need to trouble your majesty to bring them back, us brothers will do it on your behalf. \"\"Hehe, I have to ask Captain Wu Yin about this. If he agrees \u2026\"\"Unfortunately, I'm afraid you won't have the chance to ask.\"At this moment, a cold voice abruptly entered his ears.The two men in black were shocked. In a split-second, they saw a blinding red light with a scorching hot aura whizzing over. The speed was so fast that it was like lightning, and in just a split-second, it had arrived in front of them.\"Get out of the way!\" The two of them didn't hesitate at all and immediately pounced in the opposite direction. Then, they both drew out their swords. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"\"Chi!\"In an instant, the red light didn't slow down in the slightest and immediately shot towards one of the black-clothed men like a shadow following its body.The man was scared out of his wits. He waved his right arm slightly, and the black longsword in his hand swung out.\"Pfft!\"However, the dazzling red light was just like a snake as it wiggled for a moment. It actually bypassed the black longsword and almost brushed past the sharp blade. Then, it landed at the black clothed man's throat with lightning speed and the fiery energy immediately exploded.Before the man in black could even make a sound, his body froze on the spot. His round eyes still contained an incredulous expression, and his throat was pierced by a fiery red spear. Black smoke was still sizzling from the wound, and a scorching stench immediately filled the air.The owner of the spear was also wearing a tight black robe and had a slender body.This man was Tang Huan!Tang Huan didn't pause at all when he stabbed at the black clothed man. With a flick of his right hand, the tip of the spear that was as red as fire was pulled out from his throat. At almost the same time he turned his body, the long spear also reversed and pierced backwards without even looking. It was like a fire dragon had left its hole with frightening power.\"Liu Guang \u2026\"The other man in black couldn't help but scream in horror when he saw his companion killed so easily.But before he finished speaking, he discovered that the fiery red spear point had already reached his chest. Shocked, he immediately stepped back to the side, barely dodging it. The long blade in his hand was wrapped in a dark black light as he swung it towards the spear shaft at the fastest speed possible.\"Ding!\"The sound of metal clashing rang out.The black-clothed man only felt a terrifying surge of power. His entire arm had become numb, and his black longblade had been bounced up a foot high.\"You, you \u2026\"The black clothed man could not believe his eyes. He had already guessed that the person in front of him was the Tang Huan that he wanted to kill this time, but didn't His Highness say that this person was only a level four Martial Master? He was also a rank 4 Martial Master, so why was his true qi so strong? Was it just because he was a weapons craftsman?\"Hu!\"Tang Huan sneered, the long spear in his hand released a long bow and shot forward, like a divine dragon swinging its tail, it directly swept towards the black-clothed man's stomach, the scorching Qi emitted from the spear body, as though it had congealed into a violent wave of heat, pressuring over, causing an intense whistling sound.The black clothed man never expected that Tang Huan's attack would be so powerful. His face instantly turned pale and his body sank down as one hand held onto the hilt of his blade while the other held onto the body of the blade, blocking the attack.\"Bam!\"In the blink of an eye, the spear and blade collided.In the midst of the violent impact, the long spear pressed down on the saber's body and ruthlessly struck the chest of the man in black. In the next moment, the man in black was sent flying a dozen meters away before he landed heavily on the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood.A sharp killing intent flashed across's eyes, in a few steps, he had already leaped over.\"Save \u2026\"The black clothed man was scared witless when he saw this. He was about to open his mouth to scream, but before he could even finish speaking the first note, his voice suddenly stopped. It was Tang Huan's dark red, burning spear tip moving like lightning towards and out of his throat, leaving a pitch black hole.Whoosh! Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief, and quickly threw the two corpses into the bushes in the distance.Just as he was about to hide, Tang Huan realized that there were two figures flying around in the distance. They were flying over quickly, and it seemed like there were another two people behind them.Tang Huan's heart moved, he immediately bent down and picked up the long sword, and then, the second man fell down, his body pressing down on the sword and spear shaft, the spear tip piercing into the soil, his hand holding onto the man's blade, he laid down, and did not move at all.His figure was about the same as that person's. Furthermore, they were both wearing similar black clothes. Furthermore, they were also covered by some grass. At a glance, they did indeed look very similar.Of course, if one were to observe carefully, he would still be able to discover the flaw.What Tang Huan wanted to bet on now was a gamble!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: 72\"Whoosh!\" \"Whiz!\"Not long later, the two figures in front of him arrived at the wall. One of them was tall and thin while the other was of medium height. Both of them were dressed in black. [] [Table of Contents]\"This is bad!\" They have already made their move! \" Seeing the marks on the ground, the medium built man in black started to look around with a gloomy face.\"Huh?\"In the blink of an eye, the lanky man seemed to have discovered something. He sniffed and quickly walked to the front.Moments later, a black figure and a black blade entered his field of vision, and the tall, skinny man couldn't help but cry out in alarm. \"Luo Shan!\"He subconsciously took a few steps forward and crouched down beside the black figure. Then, he grabbed onto the black figure's shoulder and flipped it over.\"This is bad!\"What entered his vision was an unfamiliar young face. The lanky man's expression changed. Just as he was about to retreat, the black shadow had already flipped over and slashed at his neck. The blade was sharp and the lanky man could no longer evade it. He gritted his teeth and used his left arm to block it.\"Aooo!\"Half of his arm was chopped off. The tall, skinny man let out a miserable scream, but borrowing the force of this moment to block, his body was sent tumbling back a meter or two. But just as he was about to endure the pain and draw out the sword at his waist, ready to jump up, a red light chased him and pierced through his chest.\"Fu Chang!\"Seeing this scene, not only was it the black clothed man a few metres away, the other two who were already 20 to 30 metres away were also shocked, a tall man shouted out, \"Tang Huan, he is Tang Huan!\"\"That's right, I am Tang Huan!\"Tang Huan laughed, and threw away the black blade in his hand, his arm moved and the spear left the tall and skinny man's chest, thrusting towards the black clothed man, the sharp tip of the spear was like a red stream of light, the scorching heat had already enveloped a few metres of space in front of him.What he was using now was the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\".It was worthy of being one of the top five powerful spear skills in the Honor Continent. Tang Huan had only learned the first form of the technique, \"Prairie\". Although there was only a single stance, it fully incorporated the various uses of the spear into it, including piercing, piercing, sweeping, entangling, twirling, pushing, tapping, and so on.It could be said that it was extremely marvelous and ever-changing.\"Tang Huan, die!\"The black-clothed man roared, and two golden lights flashed from his waist. They were actually two short axes shining with a golden light.The moment his voice rang out, the dual axes had already blocked the incoming electrical spear head. However, the roaring heat from the spear head burned his skin to the point that it seemed as if it would burst open. The surging true energy from the spear head forced him to take two steps back.The man's expression changed, both of his arms suddenly exerted force, pressing down on the spear head, the dual axes in his hands quickly slid on the spear shaft, and his body rushed towards Tang Huan like a cannonball.\"Buzz!\"Tang Huan scoffed, the spear shaft shook, a violent burst of Innate Qi erupted, the spear not only broke free from the control of the two axes, but it also smashed towards's shoulder with the force of a thunderbolt. [] [Table of Contents]The black clothed man's heart sank, he had used all of his strength, yet he was still unable to control Tang Huan's spear!However, the current situation did not allow for him to think any further. The pair of axes brought out two golden streaks as they pierced towards the top of his head.\"Boom!\"In a split-second, the Fire Red Long Spear smashed onto the pair of axes.With an ear-piercing sound, the black-clothed man's arms went numb, and the two axes immediately fell off his hands. However, the longspear didn't use any strength, and still smashed into his shoulders with overwhelming force.Crack! The sound of bones breaking could be heard, and immediately after, the black clothed man fell to the ground, spitting out blood, his body twitching. His left shoulder and left chest had completely collapsed from the powerful and heavy strike, evidently, he was dead.\"The fourth!\"Tang Huan's eyes turned cold as he looked at the last two black clothed men.One of them was tall and sturdy, about thirty years old, while the other was very muscular, but he looked even younger, about twenty-four or twenty-five years old.Under the moonlight, their faces were filled with unconcealable shock.They were not too far away from the other two, but the incident just now had happened too suddenly. From the moment Fu Chang had been killed to the moment another person had been killed by a spear, it had seemed like a long time ago, but in reality, it had only been a few breaths of time.\"It seems like not only Fu Chang and Li Yue were killed by you, even Liu Guang and Luo Shan who arrived first were killed by you.\"The tall man took a deep breath as his face darkened. Killing intent filled his eyes, \"I thought you were just an ordinary Martial Master, but I didn't expect you to actually possess the strength of a Grade Four Martial Master. I have underestimated you!\" \"However, with me here, you still won't be able to escape death today.\"\"You're their captain, Wu Yin?\"Tang Huan squinted his eyes and sized up the tall man. With fighting spirit in his heart, he said, \"I had wanted to fight with a rank 5 Martial Master for a long time. Today is the perfect day to do so.\" Right after he finished speaking, Tang Huan laughed out loud, and leaped up, his spear shooting out like a rainbow piercing the sun, striking straight towards Wu Yin.\"Hu!\" Wu Yin snorted coldly. With a flick of his wrist, a huge black blade almost as tall as his body appeared from behind him. The one-foot wide blade drew a huge black beam in the air and struck the spear shaft at an oblique angle.\"Ding!\"The fiery red spear bent and twisted, swinging towards the left, and the twisting spear body was even more so, forcefully pulling Tang Huan's body and moving it a few metres in the air. But just at that moment, a sinister smile appeared between Tang Huan's brows, his wrist sank as the spear immediately became straight, and shot towards the young man at the side.\"Big brother, save me!\"The young man never expected that Tang Huan would suddenly attack him, and immediately panicked and quickly retreated. However, the speed of his retreat obviously could not keep up with the speed of the long spear as it traveled through the air. Almost at the same instant his words left his mouth, the extremely sharp tip of the spear had already arrived at his chest.\"Tang Huan, stop!\" Wu Yin was shocked, he screamed out involuntarily, and the black gigantic blade in his mouth swept towards Tang Huan like a gale wind.\"Pfft!\"Tang Huan's eyes turned cold, and his right arm loosened its grip without any hesitation. The moment his feet touched the ground, the tip of the spear had already pierced through the young man's chest.\"Uh, uh, I \u2026\"The young man released a string of difficult notes, his eyes were wide open, and his eyes were filled with despair. But before he could finish speaking, his body was lifted up by the Fire Red Long Spear, and was sent flying towards the huge black blade.When Wu Yin saw this, he tilted his saber and cleaved down onto the ground with a loud bang. The mud and sand tumbled to the two sides like a tidal wave. A long and narrow hole instantly appeared on the ground.\"Plop!\"The young man was immediately thrown out of the spearhead and fell to the ground. He didn't even move an inch. An obvious hole could be seen on his back that had been burnt through.[] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: 73\"Wu Yin, let's fight without the eyesore.\" \"Go to my room and tell me. AiqUxs.Com.\"Tang Huan smiled lightly.Before he could even take out his weapon, he had already been killed. Moreover, he had also noticed that the relationship between Wu Yin and the young man should not be ordinary, but so what? Since they were here to kill, they should have the awareness of being killed.While speaking, the spear in Tang Huan's hand was pointed at Wu Yin, the body of the spear exploded with a brilliant red light, the spear tip trembling slightly, it was extremely warm.\"Little Yu!\"\"Tang Huan, you actually dared to kill my younger brother. Today, I will make sure that you will beg for your life, beg for your death, and the woman in your shop to die little by little in front of you.\"\"Roar!\"Like an injured beast, Wu Yin released a mournful roar, he took a few steps forward and rushed towards Tang Huan. The black gigantic blade in his hand slashed across the void, the extremely violent Strength Qi shot out from the blade's body and poured towards Tang Huan like mercury.Weng! * Tang Huan held onto his spear with both hands, his wrist suddenly sank, the spear body immediately releasing an extremely loud sound, the sharp spear tip pierced through the void, and directly struck out.\"Ding!\"In a split-second, the spear tip and the blade edge actually clashed against each other, and a sharp ear-piercing sound burst out for a split-second, as two vigorous true energy gushed out from the weapon, frantically attacking, and violent Strength Qi spread out from the point of collision.This time, they collided head on and both Tang Huan and Wu Yin were forced five steps back as if they had suffered a heavy blow.But right after, the two of them did not stop. As soon as they stabilized their bodies, they brandished their weapons and rushed towards each other at the same time. Tang Huan swung his spear like a dragon, spear after spear, towards Wu Yin's head again. He was as fast as lightning, continuous and unstoppable, while the gigantic blade in Wu Yin's hand chopped out continuously with a terrifying speed.\"Ding!\" Ding! \"Ding \u2026\"A clear and intense metallic clanging sound reverberated in the night sky in an unusually dense manner.Both of them displayed their attacks to their maximum speed.In just a few breaths of time, Tang Huan had already thrusted the Scarlet Flame Spear in his hand tens of times, and Wu Yin had also slashed several dozen times in the same short amount of time. From afar, one could see a fiery red long arc and a black waterfall violently colliding with each other at a speed that was difficult to be seen with the naked eye.\"Good!\" Good! This is interesting! \"Tang Huan felt hot blood flowing through his entire body, and he started to laugh maniacally.With a \"chi chi chi chi\" sound, the speed of the spear gradually increased. One spear was faster than one spear, and the power that erupted was stronger than one spear, as afterimages began to appear in the air.Tang Huan's violent strikes brought about a lot of pressure, which made Wu Yin calm down.At this time, he finally realized how inaccurate Second Prince Sha Tu's judgement was towards Tang Huan's strength.Tang Huan was indeed only a Fourth Martial Master. The collision of true energy made him realize that the other party had only condensed a first level spirit wheel, but the other party's true energy was exceptionally violent. The speed at which he used his true energy was even faster, and he was not at a disadvantage compared to a Fifth Martial Master.[] [Table of Contents]No wonder Liu Guang, Luo Shan, and Fu Chang, who were rank 4 Martial Masters, died so easily.If his younger brother Wu Yu hadn't died, he might have been able to escape with his younger brother. But now, even if he had to risk being injured, he still wanted to kill him.\"Ding ding ding \u2026\"Wu Yin's blade didn't slow down in the slightest. In the blink of an eye, the sword and spear fiercely collided more than ten times. He immediately realised that Tang Huan's spear speed was still increasing, but his speed had reached its limit, if this continued, his head would be pierced through sooner or later.This discovery made Wu Yin's face darken.\"Ding!\"The moment the swords and spears collided again, Wu Yin suddenly borrowed the force of the collision to float back several meters. However, just as his feet landed on the ground, he stomped hard on the ground and shot forward again.\"Whirlwind!\" A thunderous roar came from Wu Yin's mouth. Suddenly, the huge saber in his hand flew through the air in a strange trajectory. The next moment, his body was covered by a pitch-black shadow of the saber.\"Hmm?\"Tang Huan only felt a terrifying aura pressing down on him as countless gigantic black blades danced within the black storm, as if they could cut any obstacle in front of them into countless pieces. With focused eyes, Tang Huan stepped back while holding onto the Fire Red Long Spear.\"So that's how it is!\"After consecutively retreating over ten steps, the corner of Tang Huan's mouth raised into a sneer.Then, he shook the Crimson Flame Spear, suddenly turning into a curved arc and piercing into the black tornado from the side. After a \"ding\" sound, the tempest dissipated like a punctured bubble. Wu Yin, who was holding onto a black broadsword, appeared once again.The tip of the spear landed on the broadened blade. Wu Yin reacted quickly and took advantage of the momentum to dodge the spear.\"You can actually see the flaws in my blade technique?\" The moment he stabilized his feet, Wu Yin pointed his long saber up into the sky. He bent his body and gasped for breath, like a tiger ready to pounce on its prey. However, his face showed an unconcealable expression of surprise.\"Wu Yin, just now, it was just an appetizer. It's about time for some stimulants!\"Tang Huan did not reply, but chuckled, and between his mind instructs (in a second), the abnormally strong power of True Fire fused into his True Qi and flowed into the long spear.In an instant, an even more violent red glow burst out from the spear's body, and it seemed as if it had completely enveloped the wisps of light. At almost the same time, an incomparably boundless heat also quickly spread out from the spear's body, instantly forming an incomparably terrifying wave of heat that seemed to burn even the air.\"You \u2026\"Wu Yin's face changed. He thought that Tang Huan had used his power of the True Fire earlier, but it took him a while to do so. At this moment, even though he was a few meters away, his skin felt a burning sensation. This sudden change made him feel somewhat panicked for the first time.He hadn't even used the power of the True Fire and yet he was already so formidable. How could he be so impressive after using the power of the True Fire?\"Look at the spear!\"Just as his mind was shaken, Tang Huan had already let out a loud laugh as the long spear in his hand whizzed over with the power to sweep away an army of a thousand.Wu Yin acted like he just woke up from a dream and quickly waved the huge blade in his hand to block the incoming attack. With a bang, he was actually pushed back several steps along with his saber. His clothes and hair were swept away by the fierce heat wave, immediately emitting a burnt smell. His exposed skin turned completely red.\"Hu!\" Just as he regained his footing, another spear came crashing down from the sky.\"Bang \u2026\"Tang Huan swept, hacked, stabbed \u2026After Wu Yin was defeated in one strike, he fell into a disadvantageous position step by step. He was in an extremely sorry state. The heat wave that came from the spear not only caused his clothes to wrinkle, but also burnt off his hair and eyebrows.Wu Yin was extremely shocked. Although he thought that Tang Huan, a Fourth Martial Master, had the ability to fight against a Fifth Martial Master, he did not think that he would be defeated, but after a short while, his opponent had already gained the upper hand. Especially since the heat emitted from his opponent's spear, it was almost unbearable for him.Wu Yin immediately felt the urge to retreat. Only by keeping his life, he would have the chance to avenge his younger brother!\"It's almost time to end it!\"But right at this moment, a faint voice suddenly sounded in his ears, and immediately after, he noticed that the spear in front of him began to tremble violently. But right at this moment, a faint voice suddenly sounded in his ears, and immediately after, he noticed that the spear in front of him began to tremble intensely.An incomparably violent and terrifying aura rushed over along with the prairie fire. Wu Yin was extremely frightened. He could actually feel an aura of death from the dark red aura in front of him.With a loud roar, the huge blade in Wu Yin's hand slashed out crazily, and an incomparably sharp black light cut into the red light like a waterfall. In the next moment, he watched helplessly as that black light was devoured by the red light, and then his entire body was covered by that dazzling red light.Then, Wu Yin felt as if his entire body was being torn apart. In a trance, two characters seemed to explode in his ears:\"Prairie Flames -\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: 74\"Five Grade Four Martial Masters and a Grade Five Martial Master. I didn't expect them to all be taken care of so quickly.\"A few hundred meters away on a small mound, a white-haired old man sat cross-legged on the ground. His two eyes looked through the gaps between the grass, sizing up the figure that was clearing up the mess under the moonlight, and his eyes suddenly became as cold as a poisonous snake. \"Since you refuse to acknowledge me as your ancestor, you will become a thorn in the side of the Tang Clan, especially the Lady.\"Huh?\"Just as the old man was about to move, he suddenly let out a surprised cry, and a black shadow appeared in the distance. It was obvious that it was a young woman, but the one that surprised him was not her, but the little blue figure sitting on her shoulder.\"Yiya, yiya \u2026\" A faint sound could be heard as the little blue beast gestured with its two little claws.\"Could it be a spirit beast?\"The old man's eyes lit up as he let out a surprised cry, his eyes burning with passion, \"I didn't think that I would be able to meet a spirit beast during tonight's activities. Indeed, the heavens are helping this old man. Since that's the case, then let's kill both of them.As soon as he finished, the old man stood up.However, just as he stepped forward, a cheerful voice rang in his ears: \"Old man, you're so old already, you should be raising flowers and all sorts of vegetables. Why do you need to crawl into the wilderness at night to fight and kill? If we die here, we won't even have a body to retrieve. \"\"Who?\"He was about to turn around when he discovered two arms reaching out from behind and grabbing his entire body. Those two arms were quite fat, and one of the fat hands was even pressing onto his lower abdomen, his dantian. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"Terrifying true energy surged within that chubby hand, causing the old man to be incomparably frightened and not dare to move an inch.\"Sigh, what a pity.\"A sigh entered the old man's ears. \"If you hadn't seen that spirit beast, you might have been able to live. But now, you're really going to throw away your corpse in the wilderness.\"\"You \u2026 Who exactly are you? \"The old man was even more shocked when he heard this. He was a Sixth Martial Master, and not only was he being approached by the person behind him, he was even being suppressed before he had made a move. That person could very well be a Seventh Martial Grand Master, or even a Eighth Martial Sect.\"If you're going to die, then there's no need to know so much.\"The voice sounded again, and the old man immediately felt a faint killing intent. His heart immediately skipped a beat, and his palms that were filled with Zhen Qi suddenly went under his arms and shot backwards like lightning. They actually hit their target right away.After succeeding with the first strike, the old man's heart was filled with joy, but soon after, despair filled his heart. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"He felt as if his palms were pressing down on a ball of soft cotton. His true qi was like a clay ox entering the sea, and did not stir up the slightest bit of ripples.In a split-second, he knew that he was completely finished. Indeed, the terrifying power in that palm immediately rushed into his dantian, causing the triple spirit wheel inside to shatter instantly. True energy uncontrollably scattered throughout his body, and in an instant, it had completely destroyed his internal organs.\"Ugh!\" The old man's head tilted to the side, and his life was snuffed out.\u2026 \u2026.\"Is there danger over there?\"Outside the walls of the blacksmith shop, Tang Huan quickly understood what little one meant.\"Is it accurate?\"Tang Huan had some suspicions. If it was a beast type, little one would quickly discover it. But if it was a Martial Warriors, it would be hard to say.\"Yiya!\" little one nodded his head.\"Shan Shan, you stay here. I'll go take a look.\"Tang Huan muttered to himself, and immediately followed little one's guidance. Behind him, Shan Shan's expression changed, but very quickly, the corner of her lips hooked up into a faint smile.In just a moment, Tang Huan had rushed up a small hill, but he did not realize anything, even a small patch of grass that was half the height of a man had already fallen to the ground.Tang Huan was secretly shocked, his eyes immediately sweeping across the place.Although the surroundings were empty, little one felt that it was not wrong, there was indeed someone hiding here just now, but right now, that person should have already left.Was that person an enemy or a friend?\"Yiya?\"little one scratched his head and blinked his dark blue eyes in confusion.\"Since we haven't seen him yet, let's head back.\" Tang Huan kept the doubts in his heart and smilingly tapped on little one's head.\"Yiya!\"little one drooped his head, feeling very depressed.Not long after Tang Huan left, on a lush tree tens of metres away from the mound, a fat figure slid down, holding a body. He muttered in surprise: \"This little thing's reaction to killing intent is not bad, it can sense danger even from so far away. \"And that little girl, I wonder where she came from. There are actually two Martial Grand Masters hiding there to protect her?\"\u2026 \u2026.South of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, in a dense forest beside the main road.\"How long has it been? Why hasn't Wu Yin and the others gathered here yet?\"Sha Tu sat on the ground, his eyes filled with dissatisfaction. Then, he waited quietly at this place, all the way until late at night. The appointed time had already passed, but Wu Yin and the others were still not around.\"Perhaps something has delayed you, Your Highness. Be patient.\" On the opposite side, a Black Costume Old Man around the age of fifty heard this and quickly advised.\"What will happen tonight?\" Sha Tu's expression was dark as he said in a deep voice, \"They couldn't have failed and aren't daring to come back to see This King, right?\"\"Absolutely impossible.\"The Black Costume Old Man shook his head and laughed, \"Their relatives and relatives are all in the Sand Empire. Even if they failed, they wouldn't dare not to come back. \"Moreover, there is no possibility of failure when dealing with a rank 4 Martial Master with only a Rank 5 Martial Master and 5 Grade 4 Martial Masters. Let's wait a little longer, they will probably be back soon.\"\"Sha Wen, you go take a look.\" Sha Tu looked at the direction of the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City with a frown and immediately gave his order.\"If I leave, then your Highness \u2026.\" The Black Costume Old Man looked around hesitantly. There was only a Rank 5 Martial Master and a dozen Rank 4 Martial Masters around him.\"Don't worry. At this time, who would dare to make a move against This King?\" Shatu snorted coldly.\"Yes, I will go now.\"Black Costume Old Man nodded and immediately flew out. Not long later, his figure had already merged with the darkness.A moment later, he suddenly felt that something was wrong. He opened his eyes abruptly and quickly scanned his surroundings, only to see that all the dozen of Martial Masters on guard were lying on the ground without the slightest movement.\"Who is it?\" Sha Tu was startled, and all the hairs on his body stood on end.\"Shatu, we meet again.\" An indifferent voice sounded, and an elegant yellow figure suddenly walked out from the darkness gracefully, \"This might be the last time we meet!\"\"It's you!\"\"...\"[] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: 75The next morning, the atmosphere in the main hall of the Tang clan's meeting room was extremely heavy.In the center of the hall, the corpse of an old man lay quietly on the ground. His face was deathly pale and his eyes were wide open. Fear still remained on his aged face.Tang Tian Feng squatted beside the corpse and used both of his hands to scan his body, while Tang Tianren, Tang Tian Shi, Tang Tian De and the rest surrounded him.The faces of everyone present turned abnormally unsightly. The person lying on the ground was called Lin Hou, and he was called Uncle Lin by the Tang Clan. He was Mei Xin's servant when she married into the clan.Although he was a servant, his strength was not to be underestimated. Many years ago, he had already become a rank 6 Martial Master.But today, he was found dead outside the archway of the Tang clan's residence. His body was stiff, and there were no injuries on his body.This matter immediately alarmed the entire Tang Clan.A Sixth Martial Master could already be considered an expert in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City. However, he was still silently beheaded outside the clan.\"After his dantian was shattered, he lost control of his true qi and his internal organs suffered a severe backlash. That was why he died!\"Tang Tian Feng stood up and said in a deep voice, \"There are no injuries on his body, which shows that his dantian was easily shattered. The person who attacked him should be much stronger than him, at least a seventh step Martial Grand Master or even a Martial Sect of the eighth step.\" It was a pity that he didn't know where he had died. Otherwise, he might have been able to find even more traces. Elder Brother, perhaps you can ask sister-in-law about this \u2026 \"\"Uncle Lin!\"Before Tang Tianfeng could finish his words, he was cut off by a sharp scream.A beautiful woman with a slim figure rushed into the hall. Looking at the unmoving corpse on the ground, her beautiful face lost all its color. She was completely dumbfounded.This beautiful lady was indeed the one who had come after hearing the news, Mei Xin.Lin Hou had always been by Mei Xin's side, and had always maintained a nonchalant relationship with her. Not to mention within the family, even in the entire Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, there were no enemies. The death of Uncle Lin was probably not the result of the enemies seeking revenge.\"Madam!\" Tang Tianren looked at Mei Xin, his low voice seemed to contain a tinge of anger, \"Do you have something to say?\"\"I... \"I \u2026\"Mei Xin snapped out of her daze, a trace of panic flashing across her face. She stammered for a while, but finally gritted her teeth and said, \"Last night, Uncle Lin went to the north side of the city!\"\"North of the city? \"Isn't that just...\"Tang Tiande was the first to react as he exclaimed in shock.He did not finish his sentence, but the meaning behind his words were understood by everyone in the hall. Tang Huan's blacksmith shop was located at the north side of the city.No one thought that Mei Xin would be so daring as to send Uncle Lin to fight at Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City.\"Madam, aren't you a little too daring? Aren't you afraid that the entire Tang Clan will fall into a perilous situation because of you?\" Tang Tianren's face was ashen as he roared out.\"I... \"I thought there wouldn't be any mistakes \u2026\"Mei Xin's face was pale as she gritted her teeth and said, \"These two days, Uncle Lin has been observing the movements of the second prince of the Sharon Empire. He even revealed the location of Huanhuan to them. I told Uncle Lin that if Shatu sent someone to do it, he would go and take a look. If they succeeded, then forget it. If they failed, then Uncle Lin could also help. Afterwards, he could completely blame it on Sha Tu. But he didn't think that Uncle Lin would \u2026 \"He \u2026\"\"...\"Everyone looked at each other. According to Mei Xin, last night was indeed a godsend opportunity. However, they didn't expect that not only had Uncle Lin been killed, but his corpse had also been thrown back.\"Could it be that Divine Armament Hall was prepared for this?\" Tang Tiansi was bewildered.\"Perhaps, it is not the Divine Armament Hall. If it was really Uncle Lin who was killed by the Divine Armament Hall, then he would not have just thrown the corpse out. Instead, he would have come to the sect to denounce them.\" Tang Tianfeng shook his head.\"If it wasn't the Divine Armament Hall, then who else would have done it? Could it be that there's someone by Tang Huan's side protecting him?\" Tang Tianshi frowned.\"Second brother, immediately arrange some people to see if rascal is still alive!\" Tang Tianren took a deep breath, his expression unsettled.\"Alright, I'll go now!\"\"...\"\u2026 \u2026.Second floor of Divine Armament Hall.Qing Ye was dressed in a green dress as he gracefully walked down the stairs. His soft chest was trembling, his slender waist was swaying, and under his perky and curvy bottom, his two slender and straight jade legs were swaying gently. Just like that, he gracefully walked over and lightly sat on the praying mat.\"Tang Huan, if you don't come, I will send someone to look for you soon.\"Looking at Tang Huan who had long since sat on the opposite side, Qing Ye's beautiful eyes narrowed into the shape of a crescent moon. That charming and charming face revealed a faint smile. She seemed to have just woken up. There was a hint of laziness between her brows, making her seem even more intoxicating.Seeing her flirtatious attitude, Tang Huan's eyes moved slightly, but he immediately calmed himself down. He laughed in surprise: \"Pavilion master, why is that?\"His purpose for coming to the Divine Armament Hall this time was actually very simple. He wanted to change the low rank blacksmith's emblem into that of a middle rank blacksmith.However, what he did not expect was that the first thing Qing Ye said upon seeing him was actually this.\"Tang Huan, do you know that this morning, the Tang Clan Master's wife, the follower called 'Lin Hou' was killed, and her corpse was left outside the Tang Clan's ancestral hall?\" Qing Ye smiled calmly.\"Lin Hou?\"Tang Huan frowned, and immediately realised that Lin Hou was the \"Uncle Lin\" that Tang Hong and the rest had mentioned, the most loyal person to the evil woman.He was actually killed?In a blink of an eye, the traces that Tang Huan found on the mound last night flashed across his mind.\"Do you know that the second prince of the Sharon Empire, Sha Tu and his ten or so followers were all killed outside the southern part of the city last night? Six people went missing.\" Qing Ye smiled again.\"What?\" Shatu is dead? \"Tang Huan's heart skipped a beat, he was truly shocked, only six people had gone missing, and he had just killed six people, including Wu Yin. This meant that Sha Tu and his men had all been killed, and not a single one had left.\"Do you know that there are already rumors in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City that you killed Sha Tu and his followers?!\" Qing Ye spoke again.\"Are you joking? I was at home last night. \"Hearing her words, Tang Huan was stunned at first, but soon after, he could not help but burst out laughing, \"Furthermore, I am only a small fourth rank Martial Master. Not to mention that by Sha Tu's side, there might even be a sixth rank Martial Master, let alone a fifth rank Martial Master.\"You're right. I also believe you didn't do it.\"Qing Ye nodded with a smile. \"However, others won't think this way. I'm afraid that the Emperor of the Sharon Empire won't think this way either. After all, you and Shatu had a conflict during the Artifact Forging Assembly. Moreover, there were rumors in the city that the six people who went missing were killed by you because they tried to kill you. After you killed them, you went outside the southern part of the city in a fit of rage and killed off Sha Tu and the others. \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: 76\"Would the Emperor of the Sand Empire believe such nonsense? Unless he's an idiot! \" Hearing this, Tang Huan started laughing.\"Of course he wouldn't believe it.\"Qing Ye smiled, \"So, there is another rumor in the city that you are from a powerful family. The reason you are staying in that small blacksmith shop in the north of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City is just to gain experience. However, even if it's just training, there will still be experts protecting you from the shadows. \"\"You can't kill Sha Tu and the others, but you can protect your masters in the dark!\"\"That's a good story, I hope it's true.\"Tang Huan laughed self-deprecatingly, but he became cautious in his heart. If it was only the rumor from before, he wouldn't have cared, but if he added this on, the damage would be extremely great.Tang Huan was very clear on the principle of 'falsifying the truth, destroying one's bones'.\"Tang Huan, your performance during this period is just too outstanding.\"Qing Ye stopped smiling, and his expression became serious, \"To use the metal attribute of the five elements to ignite a twelve meter long totem flame \u2026 Let's not talk about that. After all, it belongs to the category of innate talents.\"\"But after successfully fusing with the True Fire, it has only been a short two months since you possessed such a profound ability to refine weapons, and even obtained the championship in the Weapon Refining Competition in one go, and your True Fire has even risen to a level comparable to that of a high level weapons craftsman. This is difficult to explain.\"\"Refining a weapon isn't something that can be done with just your perception, you also need a large amount of resources to support it. If you were to say that you don't have any powerful forces backing you, not many people would believe you. And after the end of the competition, you rejected one after another from our Divine Armament Hall and the Great Tang Imperial Family, which seems to be the proof of this.\"\"If the tree is in the forest, the wind shall destroy it.\" Tang Huan sighed softly.\"Tang Huan, you \u2026 Is there anything you want to say? \" Qing Ye stood up straight, her beautiful eyes fixed on Tang Huan, expectation in her eyes.\"Yes!\"Tang Huan pondered for a bit, then nodded lightly.Qing Ye's eyes lit up, and a smile suddenly surfaced on her beautiful face. She then heard Tang Huan ask in all seriousness: \"Green Leaf Pavilion Mistress, can we begin the middle stage Refiner's assessment?\"\"Assessment?\" You. Do you still have the mood to take the examination now? \"\"Tang Huan, do you know that you are currently in an extremely dangerous situation? Once the news of Sha Tu's death reaches the Kingdom of Sharon, a large number of experts will immediately rush over from the capital to deal with you. Even if you hide in the Origin Continent, it would be useless. In the Human Allied Forces, the commander of the Sharon Empire would directly send someone from the Origin Continent to take your life. \"\"No matter how dangerous it is, I'll have to pass the mid-tier blacksmith master examination before I say anything.\"Tang Huan smiled slowly.As long as he agreed to go to the Heavenly Forging City, Qing Ye would probably immediately send someone to send him there, and recommend him to be the new disciple of the Divine Armament Hall's master. From then on, he would be considered to have truly joined the Divine Armament Hall, and would not just be an artificer recognized by the Divine Armament Hall.With this identity, even if the experts of the Kingdom of Sharon were to make a move, the Divine Armament Hall would definitely take care of it. Otherwise, even if he was promoted to a middle stage blacksmith master, the Divine Armament Hall would only be able to guarantee that no one would try to kill him. However, the Divine Armament Hall did not care about the things that were happening in the shadows, because even if Tang Huan was killed, the Divine Armament Hall would not be able to make a move against the empire.Tang Huan was grateful to Qing Ye's kindness, but he did not want to accept it. Yesterday he did not agree to Divine Armament Hall's recruitment, and from today onwards, he would not either.\"You, you \u2026\"Qing Ye was angered to the point that his face turned green, his towering breasts rose and fell rapidly, \"Okay, okay, I guess I'm just talking too much.\" Tang Huan, since you are so anxious to take the middle stage Refiner's assessment, then follow me! \" With that, Qing Ye sprung up and walked down the stairs in a huff.A flash of apology appeared in Tang Huan's eyes. He helplessly scratched his head and laughed dryly as he followed along.When Tang Huan returned to the Divine Armament Hall, it was already noon. The low rank blacksmith's badge on his body had also been changed to the middle rank blacksmith's badge. For the current Tang Huan, the middle rank blacksmith master examination was not too suspenseful. The entire process was accomplished in a natural manner and was rather easy.Along the way, Tang Huan discovered quite a few sneaky figures. On the way, some of the Martial Warriors s he met on the way recognized him and their expressions became extremely strange. There was even a fellow who approached him and advised him to quickly leave the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City to temporarily hide in the Heavenly Forging City and God-down City.Tang Huan understood in his heart that those rumors should have already been spread widely in Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City.There seemed to be an invisible hand in the darkness, it stirred the waves and stirred the rain. Tang Huan felt that a storm was brewing.After approximately an hour, Tang Huan and Shan Shan sat facing each other in the smithy. On the other hand, little one jumped around the shop with his round belly. Sometimes he struggled to jump onto the metal table, sometimes he clumsily slipped onto the weapon rack, sometimes he would swing in front of Tang Huan a few times.\"Tang Huan, you \u2026 Why are you looking at me like that? \"Shan Shan could not help but ask. Tang Huan looked at her and felt goosebumps all over her body.Ever since Tang Huan returned from the Divine Armament Hall, she had become extremely strange. She first sat inside the shop for three-and-a-half minutes without moving, as though she was a statue. She couldn't help but go out to find someone to come over to check on Tang Huan.After much difficulty, Tang Huan finally managed to make a move, but he pulled her to sit in front of him, and then looked at her without saying a word.\"Shan Shan, I've saved you three times since you arrived from the maze realm, right?\" Tang Huan sized Shan Shan up from head to toe for a moment, and then said with a smile.\"No \u2026.\" \"That's right...\"Shan Shan's tender and white face immediately flushed red. He had saved her three times, and both times had actually occurred in such an awkward situation. After that, whenever she thought about it, she would feel embarrassed, angry and helpless. However, why would this fellow mention this all of the sudden?\"Didn't you always want to repay a debt of gratitude?\" Tang Huan laughed again, and said, \"Now that the chance has come, if you really want to repay this favor, then...\"\"You \u2026 \"Don't even think about it!\"Shan Shan seemed to have thought of something, as her beautiful eyes glared at Tang Huan, her beautiful face was as red as fire, alluring to the point of being tender, as though a gentle pinch would cause juice to leak out. \"Tang Huan, I never thought that you would actually be such a person. \"Still \u2026\"Tang Huan was startled, and when he saw her expression, he could not help but not know whether to laugh or cry: \"Why do you have to have such a huge reaction, I only wanted you to help me find a person's residence.\"\"Investigate who?\"Shan Shan realized that she was wrong and could not help but feel embarrassed. She asked subconsciously, but then she came back to her senses, \"Tang Huan, you found the wrong person, I can't help you with this help, I'm just alone, I don't know where to go and find this for you.\"Tang Huan's eyes flashed with a playful smile, \"At the intersection in front of the shop, an old man and an old woman were moved here twenty days ago \u2026 About a hundred meters away from the intersection, the breakfast shop seemed to have changed its owner at that time \u2026 Do you still need me to continue? \"\"You \u2026 You already know about it? \" Shan Shan's expression changed slightly as surprise filled his eyes.\"Don't forget, I've lived in this place for sixteen years. I know every single blade of grass and every tree in this small area like the back of my hand.\" Tang Huan laughed.\"Who do you want to find out?\" Shan Shan remained silent for a moment, before she finally bit her lips and said.\"The Grand Princess of the Moyun Empire, Mo Ye!\" Tang Huan said these words with a smile, but a cold light flashed deep within his eyes.\"...\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: 77In the evening, the setting sun looked like blood. In the west side of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, in a quiet and elegant courtyard.\"Mo Dan, how's the commotion outside?\"Mo Ye sat by the stone table in the courtyard, her red hair draped over her shoulders, her jade eyes beaming, her white and delicate hands holding onto a teacup, gently sipping on it, before raising her eyes to look at the figure who had just entered. It was a middle-aged woman with similar red hair and green eyes. Although she was about forty years old, she still retained her charm.Hearing Mo Ye's words, the middle-aged woman called Mo Dan said with a smile: \"Everything was as Your Highness had expected.\"With his physique that belongs to the five elements of gold, it's rare to see able to activate a twelve meter long totem flame. The current Honor Continent, even the person from Heavenly Forging City might not be able to compare to him \u2026 Not only that, his comprehension in Tools Method might even be higher than that of the Heavenly Forging City's. You should know that even that person would not be able to raise his artifact forging ability to such an extent in such a short amount of time. \"Mo Ye parted her red lips slightly and spoke in a clear voice.\"Indeed. I've just merged with my True Fire, and I've already become a low-ranked weapons craftsman. It's only been two months, and I already have the strength of a mid-ranked weapons craftsman. This is the first time I've seen such a genius.\"Mo Dan smiled, \"It seems that the Heavenly Forging City used four months to advance from a low-level blacksmith to a mid-level blacksmith.\"\"What a pity.\" Mo Ye squinted and sighed softly.\"Has Your Highness softened your heart?\" Mordane smiled.\"He's softhearted, but that's not necessary. He's just sighing with emotion. Such a peerlessly talented genius refiner, I'm afraid that he will soon be in a state of unending fear.\"Mo Ye's expression was indifferent, her eyebrows slightly raised.\"A direct descendant of a certain mysterious clan hid his identity and went out to gain experience. When he participated in the Weapon Refining Competition, he had a conflict with the second prince of the Sharon Empire, Sha Tu.\"\"After that, the Second Prince, Sha Tu, felt indignant and sent Wu Yin and the other two men to exact vengeance on him.\"\"Unfortunately, not only were they killed, that person was completely enraged. He immediately dispatched experts to protect himself from the shadows and killed the Second Prince and the others outside the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City. When the Emperor of the Sharon Empire heard of the Second Prince's death, he flew into a rage and immediately gathered his experts, sneaking into the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, intending to kill the Second Prince. \"\"What do you think of this story?\" As she finished speaking, a faint smile emerged from the depths of Mo Ye's beautiful azure eyes.\"Very good.\"Mo Dan laughed, \"Sha Tu became a dead man, so his engagement to His Highness will naturally be annulled. His Highness will then be able to regain his freedom, and no longer need to worry about this matter.\"As for him \u2026\"Mo Dan paused for a moment before smiling, \"If he doesn't want to die, he can rely on the Divine Armament Hall or the Great Tang Imperial Family to protect his life. If he doesn't leave these two paths, that would be courting death. A man who seeks his own death, even if he does die, deserves it. \"\"Besides, this person doesn't know how to appreciate favors. Even if there isn't such a thing happening, in the future, he would still unavoidably die. Of course, the best outcome would be if that person were to rely on the Divine Armament Hall or the Great Tang Imperial Family.\"Once the Sharon Empire comes into conflict with the Divine Armament Hall or the Great Tang Imperial Family, with the character of our Emperor, he would never let go of this opportunity. If Moyun were to go to war with Sharon or the Tang, His Majesty would certainly command them personally. On the battlefield, any accident can happen at any time. \"\"If your majesty were to die accidentally, as the only son of the late emperor, he would naturally be able to take advantage of the situation and become the queen of our Moyun Empire.\" As he finished speaking, Mo Dan's eyes which were looking at Mo Ye, revealed a hint of undisguised fanaticism.\"This is indeed a wonderful result.\"The corner of Mo Ye's mouth lifted slightly, a light smile floated onto her delicate and exquisite face, but her pair of beautiful jade blue eyes grew brighter and brighter. Within her eyes, her ambition seemed to have turned into two small flames, instantly turning into a blazing prairie fire.\"Pah!\" Pow! \"Pah!\" Three loud applause suddenly echoed outside the door, followed by the creak of the courtyard door opening.\"Who?\"Mo Dan's expression suddenly changed. With a slight movement of his feet, he instantly appeared in front of Mo Ye, blocking his attack as fast as lightning. He placed his right hand on his waist, looking at the door cautiously, his eyes filled with anger.\"The result is indeed wonderful. However, I'm afraid you won't be able to see it.\"A sneer sounded, and immediately after, two figures walked in from outside.There was a youth dressed in black slightly in front of them. He had a handsome face and was tall and slender. At his back was a weapon wrapped in black cloth. His eyes revealed a mocking smile.Behind him followed a tall and slim black robed woman. She seemed to be around eighteen or nineteen years old, but her figure was curvaceous and alluring. Her appearance was also exceptionally beautiful.\"Tang Huan?\"Beside the stone table, Mo Ye slowly stood up. Her brows quietly relaxed as an expression of surprise swept across the depths of her deep blue eyes.It was fine that Tang Huan found this place accurately, but he was still able to barge in boldly. It had to be known that there were a large number of Martial Warriors guards arranged around the courtyard, and some of them were even Rank 6 Martial Masters.Tang Huan was able to kill Wu Yin who was a Level 5 Martial Master last night. He was strong, but definitely not a match for a Level 6 Martial Master.Could it be that woman behind him?\"Mo Ye, you really are a bird in a stone.\"Tang Huan smiled as he looked at the beautiful girl with red hair and green eyes who was a few metres away.After returning from the Divine Armament Hall, he carefully thought about it and realized that the target of everything was the grand elder princess of the Mo Yun Empire.It was originally just a judgment, but after hearing the sounds in the courtyard, it was completely confirmed.Tang Huan never thought that despite her young age, the Grand Princess was actually so scheming. Under her indifferent look, there was actually such a huge hidden ambition.He would first divulge the news to him, then take the opportunity to capture Sha Tu in one fell swoop. This was clearly a plan from long ago. Even if he didn't happen to meet them at the right time, there would still be others who would fall for their trick. The reason why they revealed the news about Wu Yin and the others to him was to let him live through his revenge.As long as he was alive, he could be framed successfully.Once the rumors she made up spread, Tang Huan would be left alone, even with all his mouth, he would not be able to explain himself. If he was truly seen as a murderer by the Emperor of the Sand Empire, he would have no choice but to rely on Great Tang Empire or Divine Armament Hall that could contend with the Sand Empire to survive in this world.But if he really did that, it would very likely cause a war to break out, especially if he chose to rely on the Great Tang Empire.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: 78The Honor Continent, Tang Dynasty, Mo Yun, and Sharon, these three empires, had always looked as though they were on the same level.The reason why they had been safe and sound these past few years was because of the strong threat from the Tranquil Continent. It allowed them to form Human Allied Forces to resist the invasion of the Devil Clan together. But even so, the three empires were still scheming and scheming. Previously, when the allied army had been forced to retreat, it had something to do with this.Now that Burning Heaven had been severely injured, the Devil Clan had been forced to retreat, and the sharp swords that hung over the heads of the three great empires had already disappeared.If Mo Ye's plan succeeded, this matter would very likely become the fuse that led to the war between the three nations, causing the Honor Continent to be lit on fire again. At that time, if the emperor of the Mo Yun Empire accidentally died, Mo Ye could really take advantage of the chaos and become the empress of the empire.This world was not like the ancient era where Tang Huan had existed. In the five thousand years of history, there was only one Empress Wu Zetian.Here, both men and women could train, and countless geniuses and experts could be found among the women. They could also become hegemons of this region. If Mo Ye really ascended the throne and became the queen of the Moyun Empire, it would not cause much of a backlash within the kingdom.\"Tang Huan, I have underestimated you.\"A faint smile surfaced on Mo Ye's face, \"I didn't think you would think of me so soon. Looks like I personally went to find you yesterday, and it was indeed a little wrong. Mo Ye thought for a moment, then understood the crux of the matter, \"However, I was surprised that you could find this place.\"As they spoke, Mo Ye's gaze landed on Shan Shan who was beside Tang Huan.As the Grand Princess of the Moyun royal family, her mother couldn't possibly be that ugly. Furthermore, her mother was known to be a beauty in the world. Having inherited her mother's beauty, she couldn't help but admire herself occasionally because of her beauty. In fact, she had seen quite a few beauties in the past few years. However, the number of beauties that could rival her could be counted on one hand.Even the Great Tang Empire's Little Princess Tang Yun, who participated in the \"Artifact Forging Competition\" together and obtained third place, was only able to share a fair share of fame with her.However, the woman in black in front of him caused her eyes to light up. Not only her appearance, but even her figure was better than hers.This was also because of the black robe he was wearing. If he were to change into a more suitable set of clothes, it would definitely make his appearance and figure even more outstanding. Seeing such an absolute beauty, although Mo Ye did not feel ashamed about his looks, it was the first time that he felt some jealousy in his heart.However, this little thought was quickly suppressed by her. What she was most interested in was the background of this black robed woman.She already knew that there was a girl in Tang Huan's Blacksmith Shop, but according to her intelligence, she was just an ordinary person. As such, she did not care, but from the looks of it, the situation was clearly not the case. Firstly, if the other party was really an ordinary girl, Tang Huan would not have brought him here at all.Furthermore, Tang Huan did not agree to the recruitment process of the Great Tang Imperial Family or Divine Armament Hall. It was impossible for her to obtain information on where she was staying from him so quickly.However, Tang Huan still quickly went to find him. The ones who leaked the news to him must be from some other power.Furthermore, Tang Huan and the black-robed woman were able to quietly make their way out of the courtyard. The Martial Warriors guards that were surrounding her were probably either killed or captured, and the person who was able to do so was undoubtedly an expert. Although Tang Huan possessed extraordinary talent in terms of Tools Method, due to the limitations of his strength, it was impossible for him to accomplish this.In this way, the black-robed woman who appeared at the same time as Tang Huan, naturally became the most suspicious of target.Tang Huan obviously knew that Mo Ye was guessing at Shan Shan's background, and a mocking smile surfaced in his eyes, \"Mo Ye, you killed Sha Tu, and blamed this matter on me. Not only can you completely get rid of this disgusting fiance, you can also pave the way for yourself. However, it would be too early for you to be happy if you think that we have completed our mission already. \"\"Oh? I don't think so. \"Mo Ye raised her brows slightly, a proud expression surfaced within her beautiful eyes. \"Tang Huan, the news about this Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City has already spread towards the direction of the 'Plain between Two Continents' and the capital of the Sharon Empire at the fastest speed possible.\"\"If I were you, I would immediately go to the God-down City or the Heavenly Forging City and not waste time here. If you do not have the protection of the Tang Imperial Family or the Divine Armament Hall, in a few days, perhaps it will be your anniversary. I do not wish to come to the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City next year to pay respects to my only friend. \"\"Mo Ye, do you think that you're the only one who knows how to frame a crime?\"Before Tang Huan could even open his mouth to speak, Shan Shan snorted coldly and said, \"I reckon after a while, the corpses and weapons of some of your Martial Warriors's guards will be found one after another in the southern part of the city. The ones who killed them are the weapons of Wu Yin and the other three.\"\"In addition, a few corpses were also found not far from where Shatu and the others were killed. One of them was even a rank 6 Martial Master.\"\"Rank six Martial Master?\" \"Mo Ying, you guys killed Mo Ying and the others?\"After Tang Huan and appeared, the surrounding Martial Warriors guards had not shown themselves the entire time. She had a bad premonition, but there was still a trace of hope in the bottom of her heart. After hearing Shan Shan's words, that little hope was completely shattered.A rank 6 Martial Master, a few rank 5 and many rank 4 Martial Masters were all killed just like that?Didn't this mean that there were only two people left on their side?Mo Dan's eyes showed a hint of panic. When their corpses appeared in the south side of the city, it immediately reminded people of the fact that Sha Tu was killed, not to mention that some of the Martial Warriors's guards were killed by the weapons of Wu Yin and the rest. Wu Yin was one of the guards captains next to Sha Tu.When Mo Ye heard this, her eyebrows knitted even tighter.But after a while, she smiled again, \"So what? As long as the news from the beginning spreads to the Plain between Two Continents and the capital of Sharon, even if there were different messages later on, they would only make people feel that it was someone deliberately framing and framing Mo Yun and Sharon, instigating their relationship. \"\"I'm sorry, I have something else to tell you.\"\"The news you spoke of had already been sent by the two Blood Ling Heavenly Hawks to the Plain between Two Continents and Sharon nation respectively. The news will be spread widely in those two places in at most three to five days, that's why I got the news just now.\"\"Blood Ling Heavenly Hawk?\"Hearing these words, not only the middle-aged woman Mo Dan, even the always calm Grand Princess Mo Ye's face immediately changed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: 79\"Who the hell are you to raise such a spirit beast?\"In the next moment, Mo Dan immediately asked, her beautiful eyes staring straight at Shan Shan, her gaze filled with unconcealable shock.Not only is it able to travel ten thousand miles a day, it can also fly without rest for five days and five nights straight. It is the fastest flying spirit beast in the world, and indeed, it can reach the capital of the Sharon Empire in three days, allowing one to enter the Origin Continent in five days. \"Mo Ye bit her red lips lightly, took a deep breath, and in a short period of time, her expression had calmed down yet again. She smiled indifferently, \"Tang Huan, could you introduce this sister beside you to a spirit beast like 'Blood Ling Sky Hawk'?As she finished speaking, there seemed to be a violent flicker of azure light in Mo Ye's beautiful eyes.Mo Ye looked calm on the outside, but Tang Huan could feel an almost uncontrollable rage in her eyes.Obviously, the current unforeseen event had greatly exceeded her expectations.Before the rumors she spread even reached Sharon's capital and the Plain between Two Continents, the news of her killing Sha Tu had already spread widely in those two places.With the preconceived idea, the rumors she created could still be considered to have some effect, and the lethality of the rumors towards Tang Huan would be greatly reduced.\"I don't mind telling you, she's my maid!\"Tang Huan was originally going to reject her, but then he felt a sense of ridicule from the bottom of his heart, so he casually said, \"Mo Ye, I'm so sorry, I made you dream of an empress for nothing. \"Go to my room and tell me. AiqUxs.Com.\"\"That's right, I am indeed just a small maid.\" Shan Shan smiled, but when she said those words, she was even gnashing her teeth in anger.\"A maid?\"Mo Ye was startled, as if he was a bit suspicious. \"Tang Huan, it was indeed my miscalculation this time. I had originally thought that even though you had extraordinary talent in terms of Tools Method, you were merely an abandoned son of the Tang Family who had no one to rely on in this Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City.Since she was only a maid, then there must be other powers hiding behind Tang Huan. Maybe this maid was also given to him by that power.From this, it could be seen that this Tang Huan had probably pledged his allegiance to the and the Great Tang Imperial Family before the \"Weapon Refining Competition\" began.It wasn't that he didn't want to accept it, but that he had no other choice.The reason why she chose the chess piece named Tang Huan, was because she saw that he had no one to rely on, and in the end, had no choice but to accept the protection of the Divine Armament Hall or the Great Tang Imperial Family. But from the looks of it, it seemed like he had made a mistake.[] [Table of Contents]\"Submit?\" Why would I need to rely on other powers? \"\"Mo Ye, there's no harm in telling you this. On the surface, I might be the Tang Family's bastard son, but in reality, I'm the legitimate son of a large family.\"\"However, the clan I come from is a little special. My son has to go out to gain experience since he was young and can only return after he is twenty. Originally, no one knew about this matter, but in the end, you exposed it. \"\"What?\"Mo Dan cried out in shock, while Mo Ye also revealed a bewildered expression.This was only a rumor fabricated by them, but hearing Tang Huan's words, it sounded like it was true. Was it his fault, or was Tang Huan was spouting nonsense?Compared to Mo Ye and Mo Dan, when Shan Shan heard his words and saw his serious look, he almost burst out laughing. Just thinking about how Tang Huan called him \"maid\", Shan Shan couldn't help but feel annoyed.\"Mo Ye, your calculations are indeed brilliant, and it is fortunate that I, as your maid, am capable. Otherwise, I really would have failed this time.\"Tang Huan smiled and ignored the murderous look that Shan Shan had in his eyes as he looked at the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire mockingly, \"However, although I have jumped out from the sewer now, we still have to settle our debts.\"\"What? You still want to kill me?\" Mo Ye's eyes revealed a hint of coldness.\"I shouldn't have killed you. If you die, who will the Emperor of the Sharon Empire seek to avenge his precious son? \"Tang Huan smiled as he shook his head, his gaze sweeping across her milky-white breasts a few times as he ridiculed, \"Mo Ye, you seem to be quite pretty. I just happen to be lacking a warm bed girl, why don't you stay here and repay me for a few days?\"\"Meat?\"Hearing these two words, Shan Shan was the first to react. He glared at Tang Huan fiercely.Mo Ye was stunned at first, but only after a while did she understand what she meant. A flush quietly rose up on her fair and tender cheeks, but anger was faintly discernable between her brows.\"How dare you!\"Mo Dan's face was filled with anger. He bellowed, and with a flick of his waist, his right hand, a black whip made out of unknown materials appeared in a flash, like a black ray of light, it flew across the sky and struck. However, the target was not Tang Huan, but rather, it had chosen Shan Shan out of the blue.\"Pah!\"The whip shot through the air, and a clear sound of explosion suddenly rang out. It was as if even space itself had been blown apart, and the incomparably swift and fierce Strength Qi rapidly spread outwards along with the whip. Wherever the whip passed, it seemed as if a fierce wind had swept up, and a powerful pressure immediately filled the entire courtyard.\"Humph!\"Right at this moment, a cold snort suddenly sounded out. It wasn't loud, but it sounded like thunder in a clear sky, causing one's eardrums to buzz.At almost the same time, a faint \"chi\" sound pierced the air, and a white light suddenly burst forth. It came later, and arrived first, striking the black whip before it could even touch Shan Shan.\"Ding!\"Under the violent impact, the Strength Qi stirred crazily.The long black whip instantly retracted, and Mo Dan continued to retreat. His right arm quickly moved, and the whip's body actually began to violently tremble like a snake, continuously dissipating that powerful force.The white streak of light paused in the air and then fell towards the ground.However, it had only descended not more than half a meter, when a withered, firewood like palm extended out. With one hand, it caught it, and impressively, it was a thin blade about four inches long and one inch wide. A brilliant white light leaked out from its finger, and a stooped figure appeared in front of Shan Shan.It was an old man in green clothes, about seventy or eighty years old. He had a face full of wrinkles, but a terrifying light shone out from his eyes.Seeing this old man, Tang Huan's state of mind slightly stirred, and an additional strange expression appeared in his eyes as he looked at Shan Shan.\"Hmm?\"Behind Mo Dan, Mo Ye's face darkened, she clenched her teeth and suddenly jumped back, \"Mo Dan, stop him!\"In the air, Mo Ye twisted her waist in a strange manner and actually turned around with her delicate body. Her beautiful hands gently grabbed onto the three meter tall roof's eaves and sprouted out, then with a slight movement of her body, she leapt onto the roof. Her footsteps, however, did not stop at all, and in the blink of an eye, she disappeared without a trace.[] [Table of Contents] 0Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: 80\"Shan Shan, you stay here!\"Seeing this, the corner of Tang Huan's mouth revealed a faintly discernable sneer. After speaking to Shan Shan quickly, he rushed towards the front as fast as lightning. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"Just as his body was about to collide with the wall, Tang Huan jumped out of the ground and climbed over the wall.This place was located at the outermost edge of the western part of the city. There were many houses here, but not many people lived here. Before Tang Huan had appeared, he had already figured out the terrain of this area. After exiting the courtyard, Tang Huan quickly dashed through the passageway, and in a short period of time, he had disappeared without a trace.At the same time, Mo Ye took a left and right detour within the passageway. Not long after, his field of vision opened up.Not far ahead was the dense forest.A faint smile surfaced on Mo Ye's beautiful face. There would definitely be people chasing after her, but as long as they entered the forest, escaping would be much easier.\"Bam!\"But right at that moment, a loud noise suddenly burst out, the earth wall not far away to the right suddenly exploded without any warning, and in the smoke and dust that filled the sky, a red light suddenly flashed, like an arrow leaving the bowstring, it shot towards Mo Ye, and wherever it passed by, it dragged out a sharp whistling sound. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"Mo Ye's smile froze, her face suddenly changed, the red light was not only as fast as lightning, but it was also releasing a blazing heat, even if it was a meter or two away, she could still clearly feel the exceptionally fierce heat, to the point that her clothes were about to be lit on fire.\"Tang Huan!\"Although she did not see the figure behind the smoke and dust, Mo Ye was able to guess the identity of the approaching person. The moment the two words came out of her mouth, she immediately retreated.At almost the same time, a silk-thin red glow shot out from his finger, almost soundlessly.\"Ding!\"In a split-second, the two thick and thin streaks of red light fiercely collided with each other with the speed of lightning, and a series of crisp sounds exploded out. The moment the two sides collided, an even more intense heat spread outwards in all directions as the Strength Qi twisted and turned.In a split-second, the temperature of this small patch of void actually skyrocketed.\"Yes.\"However, Mo Ye seemed to not care in the slightest about the changes in the surrounding temperature. The moment he gave a stuffy snort, that thread of tiny red light was shot backwards from the violent impact. After twirling around in the air a few times, it instantly shrank back into his sleeve and disappeared.The thick red light also retreated slightly before stopping in the air. It was a red spear.Within the brilliant fiery red light, there were even wisps of green, causing the long spear to look even more vibrant and dazzling.\"Mo Ye, you won't be able to escape!\"Amidst the laughter, a black figure walked out from the smoke and dust that filled the sky. It was Tang Huan, not only did he hold onto a spear, his slender body was also straight like a spear, with an imposing manner, and the gaze he looked at Mo Ye with had a tinge of ridicule in it.\"Tang Huan, I am already a Rank 5 Mage. You think you, a Rank 4 Martial Master, would be able to keep me here?\" Mo Ye's beautiful face congealed into frost, and a cold light flashed in the depths of her deep blue eyes.\"Rank five Martial Master, it's not like I've never killed one before!\"Tang Huan chuckled, before he finished speaking, he suddenly swung the spear, the Scarlet Flame Spear shot out like a spirit serpent from its hole, piercing forward like lightning.\"Humph!\"Mo Ye's face sunk. In that instant, he gently raised his right arm, and that thin thread of red light that was even more dazzling appeared from his sleeves once again. Like a ray of light, it shot towards Tang Huan. An extremely fierce heat was also emitted from within the red light. It was as if it was condensed from an extremely dense flame.In the blink of an eye, that small red light once again collided with Tang Huan's Scarlet Flame Spear.\"Ding!\"A crisp sound resounded through the void once more.At this moment, Tang Huan's pupils contracted. That red light was an unknown weapon, and it looked like steel wire from his previous life, but it was much softer than steel wire. It was forged using an unknown strange ore. After the fierce collision with the spearpoint, not only did it not shoot back like it had before, but it wrapped itself around the spearhead, and then began to rapidly spread upwards along the spearhead like a vine.After the flick of a finger, Tang Huan felt an extremely powerful binding and pulling force coming from the red silk, as though it was going to pull the Scarlet Flame Spear off his palm.Although the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire was also a Martial Master, she was definitely much stronger than Wu Yin.Especially her control over Zhen Qi, and Wu Yin was even more so.\"Ha!\"The inside the Dantian, \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" and the spirit wheel revolved crazily, the true energy in all nine of his meridians revolved, as though raging waves, and roared towards Tang Huan's arms with astonishing speed.In the next moment, strong true qi rushed out of his palms and penetrated into the Crimson Flame Spear.\"Buzz!\"In the midst of intense trembling sounds, an even more intense red glow burst out. Tang Huan rubbed his hands together and the fiery red spear body shook extremely hard, the red silk threads around the spear tip finally loosened up quite a bit.\"Prairie Flames!\"Tang Huan shouted loudly. Almost without any hesitation, the sharp tip of his spear released a circle after circle of spear shadows at a speed that was difficult for the naked eye to catch, like ripples, circle after circle, circle after circle, circle after circle. Within each circle of spear shadows, there seemed to be a little bit of flame that was flickering and expanding.After realizing that Mo Ye's strength was stronger than he expected, Tang Huan immediately used his most powerful killing move.With last night's experience, Tang Huan had a deeper understanding of the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" way of setting the prairie ablaze, and this spear also revealed an even stronger power.\"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art?\" Mo Ye's face immediately changed, with a light swirl of his right hand, the red thread quickly retreated.\"Fire Lotus Burst!\"Mo Ye's slender and white fingers danced like a butterfly, the thread was like a red fairy, crazily jumping around in her hands, in an instant, a flaming red lotus condensed in front of her, quickly expanding, and welcomed the roaring flames of the prairie.\"Boom!\"In the blink of an eye, the two collided.The huge fire lotus was like a volcano erupting, and it instantly burst out layer after layer of unusually violent and frightening power, wanting to tear that flame apart. Unfortunately, the flame didn't weaken, but instead became even more intense, instantly covering the fire lotus and completely devouring it.For a moment, flames shot into the sky, filling the air with their heat.In an instant, there was a clanging sound, and the red light in the sky dissipated like the tide.\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"Immediately, Mo Ye suddenly shouted out, she staggered backwards, her face as white as cream had a sickly flush on it, the red thread disappeared into her sleeves again, but this time, there were lines of blood flowing out between her fingers.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: 81\"Bang!\" Bang! \"Bang!\"In front of him, two to three meters away, Tang Huan also suffered a heavy blow and was instantly forced back by three steps. Every time his feet stepped on the ground, it sounded like a drum being struck by a huge hammer, causing muffled sounds to ring out and the stone underneath his feet to shatter.\"Hu!\"Once he stabilized his steps, Tang Huan couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief.Out of all the fights he had faced, excluding the Howling Firmament Wolf, the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire was the most powerful one.The battle skill that she used with that strange weapon just now was extremely powerful.Especially when the fire lotus exploded, the power that burst out was like a needle that had been inserted into a needle; it had actually almost broken through his' Prairie Blazing Style '.If not for the fact that Tang Huan had a new understanding of the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" after fighting with Wu Yin last night, he might not have been able to suppress Mo Ye.\"Mo Ye, it seems like you, this warm bed girl, have made up your mind.\" Tang Huan looked at her dripping jade hands and laughed.\"Tang Huan, how did you learn the 'True Flaming Rainbow Spear Art'?\"Mo Ye had also stabilized herself and turned a deaf ear to Tang Huan's teasing. She only pursed her red lips and stared straight at Tang Huan with her jade blue eyes.Although her expression didn't change much, her heart was already filled with waves of shock.Amongst all the spear arts in the Honor Continent, the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" was ranked second, second only to the first ranking \"Overlord's Armageddon\". It was the famous battle skill of a Stage Nine Martial Saint called Ye Chongshan a hundred years ago, when the Human Clan's \"Glory Empire\" had yet to fall apart. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"The Stage Nine Martial Saint had once killed countless of Devil Clan warriors on the battlefield of the Origin Continent with this battle skill.After the death of the Human Clan Ranker who founded the \"Glory Empire\", Ye Chongshan also went missing, causing the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" to disappear.However, even though the execution was lost, the description about it remained.It was precisely because of this that Mo Ye was able to recognize the 'True Flaming Rainbow Spear Art'. However, it also brought her a great amount of shock, for Tang Huan to actually be able to use the 'True Flaming Rainbow Spear Art', could it be that Tang Huan's descendant?Not only was Ye Chongshan a Stage Nine Martial Saint, he was also known as the \"Spear Saint\", one of the commanders in the army back then. In the past hundred years, he had produced a huge family clan.This perfectly matched what Tang Huan had said before.As for why Tang Huan's surname was not Ye, but Tang, it was naturally easier to explain. A direct descendant of a clan who had been out training since he was young, changing his surname was extremely normal.\"We are descendants from a large family, and we know this trivial 'Flaming Rainbow Spear Art', is it even worth making a fuss over?\"Tang Huan laughed unconcernedly, but a strange light flashed past his eyes.He had heard from Shan Shan that the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" was ranked in the top five of all the spear arts in Honor Continent. However, looking at Mo Ye's expression, it could be said that the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" was even more powerful than what Shan Shan had said.In a second, Tang Huan squinted his eyes and laughed: \"Mo Ye, since this spear art is so powerful, then hand over the weapon and obediently surrender!\"\"Tang Huan, even though you have the 'True Flaming Rainbow Spear Art', do you really think that you can beat me?\"Mo Ye sneered, he raised his hand and pointed towards the back of Tang Huan, \"I am the grand princess of the Mo Yun Empire, how can I not have any tricks up my sleeves? If you do not believe, can you look behind you?\"\"Oh? I want to see what tricks you can play. \"Tang Huan's lips curled up in an almost imperceptible sneer, and he turned to look behind him.Seeing that, both of Mo Ye's eyes lit up, and a ball of dense fiery red light suddenly exploded out from her palm. In the blink of an eye, it enveloped her entire body, and a strange energy undulated with her body as the center, spreading out in all directions.\"Stupid \u2026 \"Ah \u2026\"Mo Ye's red lips slightly parted as she laughed, but before the word \"bastard\" could even rush out of her throat, she was replaced by a scream. Although Tang Huan had turned his head to look behind him, the spear in his hand had simultaneously turned into a red light, shooting towards her like a meteor.The sharp light and blazing heat that was exposed on the tip of the spear arrived in front of his chest in an instant.\"This kind of small trick, laozi has already played it countless times!\" Tang Huan turned his head, his eyes revealing a mocking smile.\"You \u2026\"Mo Ye did not expect Tang Huan to be so sinister, to the point that he had to turn pale in fear. There was already no time for him to retreat, much less retaliate, so he could only turn his body sideways.The next moment, the tip of the spear brushed past her breasts. With a 'chi' sound, the spear tore apart her dress. Under the cover of the red light, a snow-white spear abruptly shot out.\"Hmm?\"Seeing that, Tang Huan frowned in suspicion, but he did not show any mercy at all. The spear swept towards her like a fish swinging its tail. Mo Ye was both angry and embarrassed, but she couldn't care about concealing it at all as her palms that were filled with true energy finally slammed down onto the spear shaft in front of her chest.\"Bam!\"Mo Ye flew backwards, as he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. But just as he was about to land on the ground, a light \"pa\" sound rang out, and the ball of fiery red luster burst apart like a bubble, and Mo Ye who was enveloped within it instantly disappeared without a trace, as if he had never existed.Seeing this scene, Tang Huan could not help but be startled, the doubt in his eyes becoming even stronger.\"He disappeared just like that?\"Tang Huan's brows furrowed even more. If it wasn't for the bloodstains on the ground, he might have thought that everything that had just happened was just an illusion.Two pairs of eyes scanned through the passageway \u2026After a while, a red ball the size of an egg appeared in Tang Huan's hand. It was sparkling and translucent, with countless cracks on it.This was what he had picked up from the place where Mo Ye had disappeared.\"What is this?\"Tang Huan read it over and over again a few times, but he still could not find anything, but he was sure that Mo Ye's disappearance was closely related to it.\"This is called 'Magic Bead', inside, a Magical Transmission Formation was carved by a Tian Clan Mage.\" A crisp voice sounded from behind him.\"Magic bead?\"Tang Huan didn't even need to turn his head to know that it was Shan Shan who had just arrived. Looking at the red ball in his hand, the color in his eyes grew denser, \"She actually has something from the Tian Clan?\"\"What's so special about that?\"Shan Shan gracefully walked to Tang Huan's side, grabbed the \"Magic Bead\" and lightly pinched it, causing the ball to turn into a pile of red powder that fell between her fingers, and then fell down. \"Although the three races are enemies in this world, they are not completely cut off from each other.Tang Huan nodded, as long as it was in the sea, no matter if it was a passenger ship or a cargo ship, they would all have a magic array activated with the \"Demon Source Stones\".[] [Table of Contents] How many children's shoes can be collected this time, have a monthly ticket children's shoes do not forget to cast monthly votes Oh.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: 82\"How far can this' Magic Bead 'send Mo Ye out?\" Tang Huan muttered to himself. [] [Table of Contents]\"She only used a relatively low-level teleportation magic bead. I estimate that it would be able to send her ten miles away.\" Saying that, Shan Shan suddenly looked at Tang Huan with a smile that was not a smile, \"If you chase after her now, you might be able to catch her and make her your bed warming girl.\"\"Ahem, just trying to scare her.\"Tang Huan laughed dryly, \"Since she escaped, then I will leave her alone. I will settle the debt with her first.\"had never intended to kill Mo Ye in the first place, so even if he managed to catch her, he would find a chance to let her escape. Only when Mo Ye was alive would the news that was sent to Sharon Empire and Plain between Two Continents be of the greatest use.Otherwise, the royal family would definitely pay more attention to him.However, with Mo Ye, the grand princess of the Moyun Empire leading them, the situation was completely different. Even if the royal family still suspected him, he could relax a lot. But Mo Ye's situation was not looking good, this time she was the one who stole the chicken but failed to eat the rice.\"Your account with her is over. Our account is not settled yet.\"Shan Shan raised his eyebrows, and looked at Tang Huan with an unfriendly expression, \"Tang Huan, I never thought that you would actually be the descendant of some powerful clan, you are really secretive, it seems like I do not even have status as a maid, and do not even know master's true identity.\"\"I'm just teasing her.\"Tang Huan laughed and then sized Shan Shan up with shining eyes, \"Shan Shan, I realised that you are the one who is hiding your strength, actually possessing two Blood Plume Heavenly Hawks.\"When he was in the blacksmith shop before, Shan Shan's mind was in complete chaos, but she still agreed to the request.Not long after she went out for a trip, she brought back the addresses of Mo Ye and the others. After that, Tang Huan and her were led here by the old man and his wife.While he was inspecting his surroundings, the green robed elder and his wife had already made their move, easily clearing out the surrounding Martial Warriors guards. Immediately after, the corpses of the Martial Warriors guards were all brought away by a group of young men that appeared out of nowhere.According to his conjecture, that old couple must have been Martial Grand Masters of the seventh step. Tang Huan even guessed that the reason why Uncle Lin of the Tang Clan died was most likely because of them.This series of events made Tang Huan even more curious about Shan Shan's origins.However, Tang Huan had never thought that Shan Shan would actually possess the sixth strongest flying spirit beast in the entire Spirit Beasts Board, the \"Blood Ling Sky Hawk\", and two of them at that.Before he had come, Shan Shan had not revealed this to him.\"Uh, it's just a Blood Ling Sky Eagle. Don't you have a spirit beast as well?\" Shan Shan's eyes flashed, she suddenly slapped her jade palm, and exclaimed: \"Aiya, I wonder if Grandpa Lu has caught that woman called Mo Dan yet, Tang Huan, I will go back to take a look first.\" As she spoke, she turned around, preparing to leave.\"Shan Shan, wait, I estimate that you will be leaving the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City in two days.\" Tang Huan suddenly shouted.\"Are you still going to go to 'Feng Ming Mountain'?\" Shan Shan's footsteps paused, she slowly turned around, her beautiful eyebrows slightly knitted, her expression somewhat hesitant, as though she wanted to advise him otherwise.\"That's right.\"Tang Huan nodded his head, \"Even if I put the black pot back on Mo Ye, the effects of the rumors earlier on me cannot be completely eliminated. If I continue to stay in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, I will still be at the heart of the storm, so I might as well leave this place quietly and head to Feng Ming Mountain to take a look.\"As he spoke, Tang Huan's expression was calm, but his tone was extremely resolute.After fighting with Wu Yin and the others, as well as Mo Ye, Tang Huan felt that battle skills needed to go through endless battles to be able to get stronger and stronger.His refining level could be considered quite good amongst the younger generation, but his martial strength could only be considered to be ordinary. No matter how strong one's Tools Method or how high the Tools Method Attainments was, if one did not have a sufficient amount of strong enough martial strength to match it, it would be like a flower in a mirror in the water.One had to advance both the martial path and Tools Method simultaneously.The best way to improve one's martial arts was to fight, to keep fighting!Leaving Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, going to Feng Ming Mountain in the Origin Continent was a good choice. At that place, it was said that young geniuses from the various powers in the Honor Continent were gathered there. On top of that, there was no need to worry about not having opponents at all in Feng Ming Mountain, not to mention the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\", there might even be a \"Divine Tools Catalogue\" remnant there.\"You're right.\" Shan Shan remained silent for a moment before nodding.\"Shan Shan, I initially didn't want to find out about your secrets, but now, I have to ask, if I leave the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City and your strange illness flares up again, it will be troublesome. If you believe me, you might as well tell me. Maybe I can find a way to cure it. \" Tang Huan looked at Shan Shan, and said with a serious expression.\"This \u2026\"As that awkward scene flashed through his mind, Shan Shan couldn't help but blush slightly, the shyness in her eyes faintly appeared, but then she laughed bitterly and shook her head, \"I'm afraid this illness of mine will never be able to be cured.\"\"How would we know without trying?\" Tang Huan laughed.\"The reason I'm like this is actually because my Dantian has a Pure Yang Pill Pearl since birth.\" Shan Shan bit her red lips lightly, and still spoke up in the end.\"Pure Yang Pill Pearl?\"Tang Huan was startled, this was the first time he had heard of this.Shan Shan let out a faint sigh, and then said with a wry smile: \"My mother was an extremely talented refiner when she was young. Before she fused with the 'True Fire,' she ignited a totem fire that was eight meters tall, and with outstanding aptitude and her own efforts, she became a high level refiner just past the age of twenty and became a master refiner before she was twenty-five. By the time she was forty, she was already a Tools Refining Great Master.\"\"What does Shan Shan's sickness have to do with her mother?\" Tang Huan was suspicious, but did not interrupt.\"It was also when I became a Tools Refining Great Master that my mother became pregnant with me. However, it was also during that year that my father was killed. Mother wants to avenge Father and started to forge the Divine Armament. \"\"But, how could it be so easy to forge a Divine Armament? After two consecutive failures, Mother heard the news about one of the five great Spiritual Fire, the 'Bodhichitta Fire'. Therefore, regardless of whether she is pregnant or not, she immediately went to search, and in the end, she was really able to find him. \"\"Unfortunately, my mother failed to fuse with the 'Bodhichitta Fire' in the end.\"\"Even though she barely managed to preserve her life, she was still burned by the Spiritual Fire. Furthermore, the Spiritual Fire's energy that invaded her body was gathering within her womb; that is, the 'Pure Yang Pellet' within my dantian.\"\"A few months later, Mom's injuries became worse and worse. She died a few days after giving birth to me, and the moment I was born, she carried that Pure Yang Pill with her.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: 83Tang Huan's mother had already been a Tools Refining Great Master since she was forty years old, so she was definitely a Stage Nine Martial Saint as well. She never thought that an expert of such strength, who had fused with one of the five great Spiritual Fire, the \"Bodhichitta Fire\", would also fail, and not only would she die from this, she would even implicate the fetus in her womb. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"She was not yet born. Her father had died, and she was born a few days later. Her mother had also died. This girl's life was even more miserable than her own.Who was the culprit behind her father's death?Her mother was from Stage Nine Martial Saint, and her father should be somewhere close to the truth. Even if he wasn't from Stage Nine Martial Saint, he must be a Martial Sect of the eighth step \u2026If her mother, who was in Stage Nine Martial Saint, wanted to avenge her husband, she would have to forge the Divine Armament. From this, it could be seen that the culprit was definitely a strong expert at the peak of the Stage Nine Martial Saint.Just as he was about to speak, he heard Shan Shan continue: \"That 'Pure Yang Pellet' was originally very small, but the 'Bodhichitta Fire' is wood type within the Five Great Spiritual Fire s. After the power of the Spiritual Fire has been condensed within my dantian, it will continue to grow and grow without end, and as long as I am still alive, it will continue to grow.\"\"If it wasn't for several clan elders desperately searching for a piece of Phoenix Blood Crystal when I was ten years old and trying to dispel the heat emitted by the Pure Yang Pill, I probably would have been burnt to death by it long ago.\"\"Shan Shan, where is your 'Phoenix Blood Crystal'?\"After interacting with Shan Shan for a long time, Tang Huan had never seen what the \"Phoenix Blood Crystal\" looked like before. Based on the information he had gathered from the wolf's mouth, the \"Phoenix Blood Crystal\" should be easy to see.\"The Phoenix Blood Crystal disappeared from the maze realm forest as early as.\"Shan Shan's pretty face was filled with bitterness, \"When I went to the maze realm in the forest, I heard that there was the 'Nine Yin Illusionary Dark Grass' in the depths of the forest. That maze realm forest isn't dangerous, so I only brought Uncle Huang and Aunt Wang with me. \"\"However, I never expected that the Howling Firmament Wolf King would actually be hiding there. In the end, not only did it cause Uncle Huang and Aunt Wang to lose their lives, it also caused the 'Pure Yang Pellet' to be stimulated because of me using the Divine Armament, and the heat exploded crazily. In the end, I melted an entire piece of the 'Phoenix Blood Crystal' into my Dantian, and only then did I barely manage to calm down.\"\"But even so, the power of the Phoenix Blood Crystal won't be able to sustain it for long.\"\"When I was fighting with the Howling Firmament Wolf King, I knew that even if I were to successfully kill him, I would not be able to live for long. \"Later on, the heat from the Pure Yang pill once again exploded out, but what surprised me was that it was you who saved me in the end.\"As he said till the end, Shan Shan's brows were filled with the grief of being unable to part with them, as if he was recalling the two people who had died because of her.\"Then what about the Nine Yin Illusion Grass, have you found it yet?\" Tang Huan finally understood the ins and outs of the situation in Shan Shan's body, but he still asked with some suspicion.\"What Dark Nether Grass? It's just a few very ordinary stalks of Nether Heart Ice Orchid. It's just that it looks extremely similar to the Dark Nether Grass.\" Shan Shan laughed bitterly. The two types of medicinal herbs were extremely similar and both were extremely rare, but their effects were as different as heaven and earth.\"So that's how it is.\" Tang Huan sighed, that fake news was really killing him.\"Tang Huan, although I don't know how you helped me these two times, I can only imagine what sort of method you used to suppress it. However, it is impossible to completely remove it from my Dantian. \"Shan Shan shook his head and sighed, \"Moreover, this kind of suppression is not a long term solution. The stronger I am under this kind of suppression, the stronger the backlash in the future will be, and maybe the next time the heat of the 'Pure Yang Pill' erupts, will be when my soul disappears.\"When she said those words, Shan Shan's expression had already calmed down, there was no pessimistic and desperate look in her eyes.\"That's not necessarily true.\"Tang Huan suddenly laughed, \"Let me be honest with you, the last two times your 'Pure Yang Pill Bead' exploded, I did not suppress it, but rather absorbed and refined all of the heat it emitted.\"\"What?\" Absorb and refine? \"At first, Shan Shan was startled, but soon after, he was shocked.In all these years, it wasn't that she and her family's seniors hadn't thought of this method, but it was completely impossible, even if they had to invite Tools Refining Great Master, who possessed the power of Stage Nine Martial Saint, they wouldn't be able to. Even though that expert could absorb the heat from the pill, his speed was slow and was unable to keep up with the growth of the pill.If the bead exploded, even the Tools Refining Great Master would have to choose to suppress it.It was precisely because of this that Shan Shan's first reaction was one of shock and disbelief when he heard Tang Huan's words. Even something that Tools Refining Great Master could not do was actually possible for Tang Huan, a middle stage blacksmith who was only a fourth stage Martial Master?But when she saw Tang Huan's expression and recalled his actions from before, the doubt in her heart gradually disappeared, but the shock in her eyes continued.This was too unbelievable!\"You \u2026 How did you do it? \" After a while, Shan Shan endured the shock in his heart and said.\"Maybe it's because my Tools Method is too good in terms of talent and aptitude.\"Tang Huan laughed, and naturally, he could not reveal the existence of the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", and thus, shamelessly took all the credit for his actions.Hearing that, Shan Shan did not suspect anything.Tang Huan's Tools Method talent was indeed too outstanding. Using the physique of one of the five elements to ignite a twelve meter long totem flame was not something that could be done by an ordinary refining heaven. Presumably, it was because his body was extremely special that he was able to absorb the heat from refining the \"Pure Yang Pill\".\"What I need to do now is to think of a way to take out the entire 'Pure Yang Pill Bead' and transfer it into my body. After that, I will slowly refine it. Tang Huan stopped smiling and said.Since his \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" could absorb the heat emitted from the bead, it shouldn't be a problem for it to hold the entire \"Pure Yang pill bead\". But Tang Huan did not know how to remove it from Shan Shan's Dantian. Fortunately, this was a problem, and Shan Shan should have a better say in it.\"Tang Huan, what kind of joke is this!\"Shan Shan was dumbstruck.Absorbing the heat from refining the bead was one thing, but transferring it into his body was another. The difficulty of the two could not be compared. The reason she was able to live to such a large extent was because of the birth of the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" in her body and the \"Phoenix Blood Crystal\" in the second reason.However, if that \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" were to enter someone else's body, that person would probably be instantly incinerated to death.\"This is not a joke, Shan Shan, what I said was true.\" Tang Huan said with a stern expression.\"This \u2026\" Shan Shan hesitated, \"Tang Huan, that is an entire 'Pure Yang Pellet', are you sure you can handle it?\"Tang Huan's suggestion did indeed hold a great amount of enticement towards her.The moment the \"Pure Yang Pill\" left her dantian, it would be equivalent to completely resolving the hidden danger in her body. At that time, not only would she be able to recover her strength, she would also be able to cultivate at a tremendous pace in the future. However, Tang Huan's suggestion was simply too dangerous for him.\"Don't worry, I won't take my life as a joke.\"Tang Huan smiled slightly. If he could obtain that \"Pure Yang Pearl\", not only would it help Shan Shan get rid of his hidden danger, it would also greatly increase his cultivation and True Fire.It could be said that it was perfect!\"Then... I will find Grandpa Lu and Grandma Zhang later and ask them how knowledgeable they are. Maybe they know the method to transfer the Pure Yang Pill. \" There was still a worry that was difficult to hide on Shan Shan's beautiful face.\"...\"[] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: 84\"Good, good, this rascal, even if he doesn't die this time, he will at least be stripped of his skin!\"In the meeting hall of the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, Tang clan, a loud laughter suddenly rang out. Tang Tianshi's brows were filled with an unconcealable joy.Surrounding them, Tang Tianren, Tang Tian Feng and the others all revealed a smile on their faces.The news of the death of the second prince of the Sharon Empire had long ago spread throughout the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, and they had long since known of it.At that time, they were also extremely shocked, and were secretly guessing who did it, who would have thought that they would actually find out about the matter regarding Tang Huan.Of course they knew, this was just a rumor.They were very clear about Tang Huan's background. How could the abandoned son of the Tang Family, who had been adopted by an old blacksmith, who was said to be a low-ranked artificer, be the direct descendant of some mysterious clan that had a huge power? It was very obvious that someone had spread the news on purpose of offending Tang Huan.Even if the blame was not met, it would still be able to muddy the waters of the pool.That Tang Huan was truly in danger this time. After all, he had indeed clashed with Sha Tu during the \"Artifact Forging Competition\". It was difficult for him to explain the crimes of the death of Sha Tu because the Royal family would not listen to his explanation and had sent their experts to capture him.He was only a mere Grade Four Martial Master. There was no way he could resist.\"That's good as well. This has saved us a lot of effort.\" Tang Tianfeng also laughed.\"I'm afraid it's not that simple.\"Tang Tianren's smile faded as he slowly said, \"That rascal's Tools Method talent is astonishing. If we join either the Divine Armament Hall or the Great Tang Imperial Family, it might cause the entire Honor Continent to fall back into chaos \u2026\" Before he could finish speaking, a figure hurriedly entered. It was the Tang Clan's General Manager, Tang Tiande.\"There's new news.\"Before he could even catch his breath, Tang Tiande said with a dark face, \"The corpses of the missing guards by Sha Tu's side have been found. The corpses of the other Martial Warriors s that appeared with them have also been identified as being the guards of the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire.\"\"What?\" Not only was Tang Tianren shocked, Tang Tian Shi, Tang Tian Feng and the others were so shocked that they stood up.\"You mean, the one who killed Sha Tu was the chief princess of the Mo Yun Empire, Mo Ye?\" Just as he came to his senses, Tang Tianshi asked anxiously. His expression was extremely gloomy.\"Very likely.\"Tang Tian De nodded his head, \"Moreover, not far from the place where Sha Tu was killed, the corpses of the other guards beside Mo Ye were also discovered.\"\"Could it be that someone framed her, and Mo Ye and Sha Tu already have an engagement?\" Tang Tianren, Tang Tianfeng, and the others all looked at Tang Tiande.\"There's news that Mo Ye is extremely dissatisfied with Sha Tu, and has always wished for nothing more than to kill him as soon as possible \u2026 This should not be a rumor. Judging from the situation at the competition grounds that day, Mo Ye and Sha Tu did not get along well with each other. \" Tang Tiande shook his head, \"So, she really did have a good reason to make a move.\"\"How could this be?\"Tang Tian Si sat back down on his seat, his face twitching slightly as his expression became extremely ugly. He had thought that the good days of Tang Huan would end soon, but who would have thought that after being happy for just a while, the situation would change completely.\u2026 \u2026.\"Mo Ye did it?\"On the third floor of Divine Armament Hall, Qing Ye frowned, \"Even the corpses of our guards have been found, isn't that Mo Yun Empire's Grand Princess acting a little too sloppy?\" Although Mo Ye and I have only met once in the Artifact Forging Competition, I feel that she is not such an impatient person. \"\"Maybe she was too busy to transport the corpses of her guards away, or maybe her subordinates were too incompetent, and she didn't even know about it \u2026\" Lu Yao muttered to himself.\"Killing a prince of a country that I am betrothed to is no small matter. Before we take action, Mo Ye will definitely plan for a thousand things, in case there are any loopholes, but the loophole that appeared right now is simply too big.\" Qing Ye shook his head, his charming face was filled with doubts.\"Pavilion master means to say, someone is instigating a relationship between the Mo Yun Empire and the Sharon Empire, and someone else is killing Sha Tu?\" Lu Yao asked in surprise.\"Not necessarily.\"Qing Ye smiled slightly and said, \"Compared to Tang Huan, Mo Ye is more likely to be the culprit. Rather than saying that it is a provocation to the relationship between Mo Yun and Sharon, it would be more accurate to say that it is a deliberate attempt to muddle the water so as to divert everyone's attention away from the impact of the rumor. \"\"Pavilion Master is saying \u2026 Tang Huan? \" Lu Yao was startled, and then immediately exclaimed in shock.\"Exactly.\"\"Otherwise, this would be too much of a coincidence. The news of Tang Huan killing Sha Tu and his mysterious origins appeared not long ago, and a large number of corpses were found, which then led to the discovery of the real culprit, the Grand Princess of the Mo Yun Empire.\"\"Although this move is simple, it is indeed very powerful.\" Lu Yao couldn't help but nod his head, \"When I returned, I discovered that the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City was everywhere discussing about Sha Tu and Mo Ye, and very few people had mentioned Tang Huan. However, Tang Huan is alone, and his strength is not high, how did he do it? \"\"I can't guess either.\"Qing Ye narrowed her beautiful eyes as her gaze became distant. \"This guy is really making me more and more unable to see through him.\" However, this matter cannot be handled by himself. Spreading the news to the entire city in such a short period of time would be impossible without hundreds of people. \"\"This guy can't have secretly defected to any other power before. Could it be that the rumor is true, and that he is the direct descendant of some big family?\" Qing Ye seemed to be talking to himself, but also seemed to be asking Lu Yao.\"Err \u2026\"Luyao wanted to laugh out loud, but before he could do so, he froze, the expression on his face turning strange.He suddenly realized that Qing Ye's guess was not impossible.At almost the same time, outside the small weapon store at the north of Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City, Fat Old Man was lying on a recliner under a tree with his fat body, his eyes were squinted to the point that there were only two small slits left, but he mumbled with his mouth: \"This is really too interesting, before I, Lord Fatty, even made a move, this brat's situation has been resolved to the entire time, it seems like this girl has done it herself. \"Tsk tsk, this brat's luck with women is quite good. I really didn't expect that girl to actually \u2026\"\"Boss, how much is this sword?\" Suddenly, a young man in gorgeous clothes excitedly ran out with a heavy sword in hand.\"Eight hundred gold coins!\" Fat Old Man opened his eyes slightly and glanced sideways.\"Eight hundred gold coins?\" Isn't the price just 400? \"The young man came to his senses after a moment, and then shouted angrily: \"This sword is not even a low level weapon, just selling it for 400 gold coins is enough to scam people, now you are actually selling it for 800 gold coins, is this how you do business? Old man, are you crazy about money? \"Under his rage, the young man, Bai Jun's face turned red. He threw his sword on the old man's bulging belly, turned around, and left.\"What a pity, what a pity!\"Fat Old Man was not angry, he only pulled out his heavy sword with a \"clang\", shook his head and sighed, \"The head of the Weapon Refining Competition, Tang Huan, will be the first weapon forged by Tools Refining Great Master in the future, and it will be the best collection of treasures, yet it will be abandoned just like that \u2026\"\"What?\" \"Boss, is that true?\" The young man halted his steps and ran back in a flash. He smiled in embarrassment, but his eyes were shining.\"Did you see that? This is the exclusive symbol for Tang Huan. It's said that he created the word 'Tang'. If you don't believe me, you can take it to the Starsea Weapon Shop and ask. Yesterday, a shop assistant from the Starsea Weapon Shop came over to take a few weapons forged by Tang Huan. \"\"Alright, alright. 800 gold coins, I'll take it!\"\"My apologies, little brother. The treasured sword has a spirit. It was just abandoned by you, so it is now very angry. Without 1000 gold coins, it won't follow you.\"\"A thousand gold coins?\" You, you \u2026. This evil merchant! \"\"Ai ai, look! It's angry again. It has to pay a thousand two hundred gold coins.\"\"...\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: 85\"Are you sure this method will work?\"The night was dark, and in the room behind the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City's North Blacksmith Shop, Tang Huan was looking at Shan Shan in astonishment. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"This was already the second night of his battle with Mo Ye.Yesterday evening, when they returned to the courtyard, the old man in green clothes, who was called Grandpa Lu by Shan Shan, had long captured Mo Dan and brought him back to the shop at the north side of the city. However, the old man surnamed Lu and the old woman Zhang who returned later could not think of any way to transfer the pill beads.Tang Huan was not in a hurry either. Even though he still did not know where Shan Shan came from, through the layers and layers of clues, Tang Huan knew that there was definitely an exceptionally huge power behind her.As long as she continued, she should be able to find a solution.However, Tang Huan reckoned that no matter how fast it was, it would take at least three or four days. He never expected that tonight, Shan Shan would bring back two pieces of good news.One was that Mordane had finally managed to escape.Sending people to follow her quietly might be able to find traces of Mo Ye, and then revealing his whereabouts from time to time. Naturally, it would be easier for them to attract the royal family's attention to her.The second piece of good news was naturally that Shan Shan had found a way to remove the pill.\"It will definitely be useful!\"Shan Shan nodded heavily, a captivating bright red color surfaced on her snow-white face, but her bright black eyes were filled with unconcealable joy and excitement.Tang Huan was a little hesitant: \"This method is too risky, if we fail \u2026\"\"If it really fails, that is my fate as well.\"Shan Shan gritted his teeth as he looked at Tang Huan with gleaming eyes, \"This' Pure Yang Pill 'has tormented me for almost twenty years. As long as I can drive it away, it's worth it no matter how big the risk is. Tang Huan, now it's all up to you, if you can't take it, you don't have to force yourself, if not, I am afraid that you will lose your life. \"\"You don't have to worry about me.\"Tang Huan laughed, \"Since you have made up your mind, let us begin now!\"Following which, Tang Huan's gaze fell upon the big wooden box inside the room. The box was around two meters long and one meter wide, and the material was probably the same as the wooden box his master left him. This kind of wood was said to be called the \"Spirit Exquisite Tree\". If something was placed in a box made from this wood, it could isolate the most of one's breath.This box was what Shan Shan had just brought.Even though it was separated from the wood box by the \"Spirit Severing Tree\", there was still an extremely strong chill coming from it. One could tell that the items inside were definitely not ordinary.\"Yiya!\"little one was walking around the wooden box. From time to time, she would stretch out her little claws and scratch the lid of the box with curiosity. Noticing Tang Huan's gaze, little one immediately called out happily. His dark blue eyes seemed to reveal an extremely human-like look of anticipation and excitement.\"Shan Shan, get ready!\" Tang Huan took two steps forward and crouched beside the wooden box.\"Yes.\"Shan Shan let out a light snort.Following that, Shan Shan raised her head slightly and threw a green pill into her mouth, then swallowed it. She gently pulled at her belt and her black clothes quietly fell to the ground.Even though she was standing behind Tang Huan, Shan Shan was still incomparably embarrassed. Her extremely beautiful face was like a ripe peach, as if a gentle pinch would cause juice to leak out. However, Shan Shan quickly adjusted her state of mind, resisted the embarrassment, and gracefully moved her beautiful legs to Tang Huan's side.\"Yiya?\"little one looked at Shan Shan suspiciously, as if he didn't understand why she would do such a thing.Tang Huan also subconsciously looked to the side when he heard Shan Shan's light footsteps.The incomparably captivating and beautiful scenery entered his eyes, Tang Huan could not help but feel a sense of excitement in his heart, but in a moment, he took a deep breath, refocused his mind, and forcibly shifted his gaze away from her flawless body, and held the locket.Even so, Tang Huan's gaze made Shan Shan even more embarrassed.The previous two times, although she had exposed her body in front of Tang Huan, it had all happened without her realizing it. But now, with her consciousness completely awake, she had stripped naked beside a man.In a split second, Shan Shan's bright red face became even hotter.\"Begin!\"Tang Huan had already completely calmed down. \"Bada\" he opened the lock and lifted the lid.\"Hu!\"In the next moment, the bone-chilling cold seemed to have condensed into a substance. With the wooden box as the center, it swept out in all directions. In just a blink of an eye, an exceptionally frightening cold spread to every corner of the room, causing the entire room to turn into a cave of ice.\"Yiya?\"little one screamed in fear, her blue body trembling uncontrollably, but she did not dare to stay for another second. Using all her claws, she ran to the window with her fastest speed, and jumped out.Not long after, two more small claws appeared at the window, followed by a small blue head that peeked in with curiosity.Tang Huan, who bore the brunt of the attack, also couldn't help but shiver.Without the slightest hesitation, Tang Huan immediately activated the \"Qi of Heaven and Earth\" to its limits. The inside the Dantian, the cauldron 'Nine Yang Divine Furnace', and the spiritual wheel quickly revolved, and a scorching heat leaked out of the cauldron. It flowed through the entire body along the true energy, and only then was the cold's invasion blocked.Even so, Tang Huan's hands and feet still felt somewhat stiff.\"As expected of the 'Mystery Ice'!\"Tang Huan's eyes revealed a look of shock, and his gaze landed on the box.Inside was a piece of ice as smooth as jade. Whether it was length, width, or thickness, it all fit the wooden box perfectly.It was the \"Yin Profound Ice\" that Tang Huan had mentioned before, and also the source of that terrifying chill.Although it looked crystal clear and bright enough, no different from ordinary ice cubes, if one looked carefully, they would notice that there seemed to be many white-colored odor lingering inside the thick ice block.\"Tang Huan, I \u2026 Move quickly... \"There's no need \u2026\"The true qi within Shan Shan's body had already disappeared. Now that he was engulfed by the cold, not only did his face turn red, his movements became somewhat stiff. Like a marionette, he struggled to take a small step forward before he could no longer move.\"I'll carry you up!\" Tang Huan stood up and carried Shan Shan by his waist, and then placed him on top of the abnormally cold \"Yin Profound Ice\".\"Tang \u2026\" Huanhuan \u2026 Little \u2026 \"Heart \u2026\"Shan Shan lay flat on his back. At this time, he no longer had any thoughts of being embarrassed, and after stumbling back and forth to say these few words, his eyes had already closed, and then did not move again. Shortly after, a thin layer of ice began to spread on the surface of her body at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye.In just a short span of one or two breaths of time, Shan Shan's body seemed to have turned into a beautiful ice sculpture.[] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: 86Tang Huan quietly sat at the side, his eyes shining brightly as he looked at Shan Shan.In Tang Huan's eyes, there was practically no more privacy on top of Shan Shan's body, but right now, not only was there not the slightest bit of desire in his heart, he was instead a bit nervous.Letting out a long breath, Tang Huan tried his best to calm his mind.The method Shan Shan brought over was actually very simple; it was to borrow the cold energy of the \"Yin Yang Profound Ice\" to thoroughly activate the \"Pure Yang Pellet.\"The \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" was not a spiritual object, but it also had the instinct to avoid danger.Under the frightful cold of the \"Absolute Yin Ice\", its initial reaction must have been to release heat, to resist with all its might. In a situation where it had consumed a certain amount of heat, Tang Huan immediately seized the opportunity and activated his True Fire to lure it out of Shan Shan's Dantian.This method might sound simple, but to Shan Shan, it was incomparably dangerous.The cold aura of the \"Yin Profound Ice\" was too intense. Although Shan Shan had taken a precious medicine called the \"Destiny Soul Pill\", it allowed her to retain a sliver of life after being frozen by the \"Yin Profound Ice\". However, if she took too long, there was a high chance that she would become a real ice sculpture.Furthermore, after activating the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\", her body would become a battlefield filled with hot and cold Qi. If her internal organs and spirit veins could not handle such a conflict, perhaps before Tang Huan could lure the \"Pure Yang Pill\" out, she would have already passed away.Moreover, the probability of these two accidents happening was very high.Tang Huan's mind raced, his eyes looking at Shan Shan's flat stomach.Right now, the cold from the \"Yin Profound Ice\" should have completely seeped into her body, yet her dantian had yet to show any signs of movement.Time flew, Tang Huan stared at it unblinkingly.\"Yiya?\" At the window, little one once again stuck his head out, blinking his dark blue eyes and looked inside, but after lying there for only a moment, it couldn't endure it anymore and immediately shrank back.\"There's finally movement!\"Just at this time, Tang Huan's eyes could not help but light up, and a hint of happiness finally appeared between his brows, but he resisted the urge to press his palms against Shan Shan's lower abdomen.He couldn't act too hastily in luring the 'Pure Yang Pill Bead'. Otherwise, it would only backfire on him.The heat continuously emitted from Shan Shan's lower abdomen. At first, it was rather weak, but in the time it took for two to three breaths of time, it had already become extremely intense, like wave after wave of waves of waves. Each wave was stronger than the previous one, and the ice crystals surrounding Shan Shan's lower abdomen quickly melted.However, almost at the same time, the coldness that originated from the \"Yin Yang Profound Ice\" continued to invade him.Once the ice crystals melted, they would reform, then melt, then condense again \u2026 It went on and on like this. On Shan Shan's abdomen, the scorching and freezing auras continued to collide and stick together.Shan Shan did not move, as though he did not feel anything.However, Tang Huan knew in his heart that Shan Shan was currently suffering from excruciating pain, pain that was probably not any less than the time he was fusing with his True Fire.\"You must hold on!\"Tang Huan muttered to himself, suppressing the worry in his heart, he tried his best to circulate the True Qi in his body, on one hand resisting the cold, and on the other hand carefully observing the condition of Shan Shan's abdomen.At this moment, Tang Huan had already displayed his senses to their fullest.It would be difficult to grasp the timing. If it was too early, it would be harmful to Shan Shan, and if he was too late, Shan Shan would have to bear an even greater risk. Even if it was just a few seconds later, it might cause Shan Shan to lose his life.After a while, the heat emitted from Shan Shan's abdomen started to become unstable.The cold aura that the \"Yin Profound Ice\" emitted never weakened, and was extremely distinct when compared to the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" inside Shan Shan's dantian.\"It's time!\"Tang Huan slightly narrowed his eyes, and in the next instant, his palms pressed onto Shan Shan's abdomen.Different from the other parts of Shan Shan's body, her abdomen was protected by the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" which was continuously emitting heat. It was not frozen but still felt extremely soft and creamy.However, Tang Huan did not have the spirit to experience this wonderful feeling at all.With a thought, Tang Huan activated the \"Spiritual Wheel of Universal Truth\" to the extreme. Not only did the inside the Dantian revolve at an unprecedented speed, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" also circulated to the extreme.The two streams of heat did not pierce through the center of his palm and instead turned into flames. Instead, they fluctuated slightly in Tang Huan's palms and continuously emitted heat.Furthermore, the heat was neither strong nor weak. Compared to when Tang Huan was refining, it could not even be mentioned in the same breath.Of course, this was also done intentionally by Tang Huan.The thing that had condensed the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" in Shan Shan's dantian was the heat of the \"Bodhichitta Fire\". This kind of Spiritual Fire power belonged to the wood element, while Tang Huan had the physique of metal element, which also made his primordial flames contain a characteristic of gold.Out of the five elements, metal countered wood.If Tang Huan used the heat up to it too strongly, it would cause the \"Pure Yang pill\" to shrink back into Shan Shan's dantian, not daring to move. Therefore, the heat emitted from his body was a little weaker than the heat emitted from the Pure Yang pill. However, it couldn't be too weak or too weak, and the Pure Yang pill wasn't worth looking at.Only by perfectly controlling the intensity of the heat would it be able to move the 'Pure Yang Pill Bead'.After all, while gold was the nemesis of wood, it was hard metal.Facing a source of warmth that was a little weaker than him, but not especially so, the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" was bound to stir up and want to seize the nest.If it was a normal situation, even if it wanted to move, it would not necessarily leave Shan Shan's dantian. But now, with his nest being continuously corroded by the cold energy of the \"Yin Profound Ice\", the situation was completely different.Sure enough, in the next moment, Tang Huan discovered that the heat coming out from Shan Shan's dantian was suddenly strengthened, and in an instant it covered both of his palms.However, after an instant, the heat weakened again.At this critical moment, Tang Huan's heart was abnormally calm. He continued to maintain the stability of the heat in his palm, and it did not increase because of the retreat of the heat.Not long later, the heat emitted by the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" became strong once more.It also only lasted for a short while before the heat weakened again.Tang Huan's mind was unperturbed, he did not feel the slightest bit of disturbance, and after repeating this several times, a burst of heat, which was more powerful and majestic than ever, suddenly erupted from Shan Shan's lower abdomen.In a split-second, Tang Huan's entire body was enveloped by this strong heat.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: 87Chapter 87\"It's about time!\" Tang Huan's mind moved, his palms suddenly leaving Shan Shan's abdomen.\"Buzz!\"A red ball suddenly shot out from Shan Shan's Dantian. It was about the size of a fist and crystal clear, like it was polished out of jade, and within the ball, a faint trace of green could be seen.The moment this sphere appeared, an incomparably terrifying heat spread out in all directions. It was as if the air itself was on the verge of igniting. The cold that had been filling this space immediately receded quite a bit.\"Pure Yang pill!\"Tang Huan's eyes lit up. He retracted his hands, and with the posture of wanting to leave, he indeed lured the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" out of Shan Shan's inside the Dantian.\"Hu!\"Without even pausing, the red ball smashed into Tang Huan's abdomen.The inside the Dantian and spirit wheel were still operating quickly, but the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" had already slowed down. Inside the cauldron, the ball of \"True Fire\" had also become extremely restrained, to prevent its efforts from falling short at the last moment.As soon as the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" entered the Dantian, it found the source of the heat.Without even the slightest hesitation, the red ball rushed into the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\". Following that, it charged towards the cluster of True Fire with a fierce heat, like a hungry tiger pouncing on a sheep, as though it wanted to devour it all and occupy this place.\"It's a success!\"Now, Tang Huan could no longer suppress the happiness in his chest. In between his mind instructs (in a second), the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" began to spin crazily without any warning.In an instant, the sound of an intense buzzing began to shake through the inside the Dantian, and that cluster of primordial flames also exploded into an incomparably blazing heat.Seemingly at the same time, Tang Huan grabbed with both hands and picked Shan Shan up from the Yin Profound Ice. With a flick of his body, he kicked the lid of the wooden chest up. With a bang, the lid of the box closed and Tang Huan rushed out like a whirlwind with Shan Shan in her arms, entering the neighboring room.\"Yiya!\"When little one who was walking back and forth near the door saw him, he immediately slipped in and looked at Tang Huan who had an anxious expression on his face and then glanced at Shan Shan who looked like an ice sculpture. His pair of dark blue eyes revealed an even denser sense of doubt, and he cried out, \"Yiya?\"Tang Huan didn't have time to respond. He placed Shan Shan on the bed and started slapping her body with his palms.The true energy that contained true essence unceasingly overflowed from her palms and seeped into her body. But at this moment, within the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\", the \"Pure Yang Bead\" that had been stunned by the sudden change also seemed to wake up from its stupor and began to crazily charge, wanting to escape.\"Boom!\" \"Boom \u2026\"Dull chimes rose and fell.Every time the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" collided, it would emit an exceptionally dense and terrifying heat. Just in the blink of an eye, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" seemed to be filled with the heat emitted by the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\", and the red bead's collision did not show any signs of stopping.The heat was so strong that Tang Huan felt like his dantian was about to explode.After successfully absorbing and refining the heat emitted from the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" twice, Tang Huan felt that it wouldn't be too difficult to store the \"Pure Yang Pellet Pearl\" with the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\".But now, Tang Huan realized that he had still underestimated it.The instinct of this \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" was indeed strong.According to Tang Huan's estimations, if it remained in Shan Shan's inside the Dantian for another ten or twenty years, it would truly be able to give birth to an extremely weak consciousness, and turn into a young \"Bodhichitta Fire\".At that time, Shan Shan would definitely be engulfed.However, even though the current \"Pure Yang Pellet\" did not have any spirituality, its frightening instincts had immediately made Tang Huan experience a pain in his ass.The stronger its instincts were, the more it could sense danger, and the stronger its resistance would be.Of course, if the \"Pure Yang Pellet\" did not have this kind of instinct, Tang Huan would not have been able to lure it out of Shan Shan's Dantian. In addition, the stronger one's instincts were, the greater one's gains would be after refining it.This could be considered as having both advantages and disadvantages.\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\"In just a short period of time, Tang Huan was already like a cooked shrimp, his entire body was boiling red, beads of sweat as big as beans oozed out of his pores, and even his breath seemed to have turned into two hot streams. In the blink of an eye, Tang Huan's clothes were all drenched.What was even more difficult to endure than the heat was the increasingly stronger feeling of swelling in Tang Huan's stomach.\"En!\"Both of Tang Huan's eyes opened wide, his cheeks twitched slightly, and he couldn't help but grind his teeth as he let out a grunt. However, his hands were not affected in the slightest, and continued to rise and fall on Shan Shan's body, including his head, neck, arms, chest, and legs \u2026He had to wake Shan Shan up before the effects of the \"Destiny Soul Pill\" wore off.\"Pah!\" \"Pah \u2026\"Tang Huan's palms moved like lightning, and the light and concentrated sound of his strikes resounded throughout the room. True energy continuously entered Shan Shan's body, and within Tang Huan's nine spirit veins, true energy gradually weakened.Fortunately, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" was constantly rotating at an extreme speed, continuously refining the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" to replenish the True Qi, causing the speed at which the True Qi was being reduced to be greatly reduced.However, although he did not have to worry about his true qi being exhausted, the 'Pure Yang Pill Beads' were still frantically clashing within the cauldron. The rate at which heat was being refined could not keep up with the rate at which it expanded.The burning and swelling sensation of the inside the Dantian continued to increase.The clothes on his body were also dry and wet, wet and dry. Unknowingly, a fine crack had even appeared on the surface of Tang Huan's body, and wisps of blood lines seeped out from the crack, but were immediately evaporated by the heat.Fortunately, Tang Huan's hard work was not in vain. As time passed, Shan Shan's stiff and cold body slowly became softer, her temperature slowly increased, and a faint color of blood started to appear on her pale beautiful face. All of this signified that Shan Shan's situation was slowly improving.\"Ugh!\" After a long while, Shan Shan frowned, and suddenly let out an almost inaudible cry.\"Success, haha \u2026\"After being stunned for a moment, his heart involuntarily surged with an ecstatic feeling, and he started laughing out loud. However, before he could laugh twice, Tang Huan fell onto the ground with a thud, no longer making any movements, and had already fainted.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: 88The refreshing feeling continuously spread inside his body, and had already spread to his limbs and bones, his internal organs, and Tang Huan felt as if he was drinking nectar, his entire body feeling extremely comfortable. The blazing heat that filled his entire body, the feeling of swelling up and about to explode from the Dantian, all disappeared without a trace.This familiar feeling suddenly woke Tang Huan up.The moment he opened his eyes, he saw Xiao Budian's small blue head, which was just inches away from him, opening his mouth slightly. A bit of gold could be faintly seen at the tip of his tongue.This scene was exactly the same as when he was in Maze Realm Forest.\"Xiao Budian!\" With the experience from last time, Tang Huan immediately realized what had just happened. He couldn't help but hold onto the little fellow and roll over, sitting up.\"Yiya.\" Xiao Budian's dark blue eyes were filled with excitement. After calling out weakly, her eyelids suddenly drooped, her head drooped, and her small body curled up.\"Xiao Budian?\"Tang Huan was slightly startled, and immediately observed carefully.When he realized that it was only sleeping, Tang Huan heaved a sigh of relief.Looking at its golden horn that was much dimmer than last time, Tang Huan knew that it had used up a lot more of the golden liquid this time.Seeing its state, Tang Huan couldn't help but feel guilty.The little guy followed him. He hadn't eaten any good gems, and had instead suffered two serious injuries in a row.Previously, in the Maze Realm Forest, if there were no other Golden Horn Liquid, Tang Huan's injuries would have taken at least ten days to heal. This time, if not for the Golden Horn Liquid, even though Tang Huan's Dantian would not have burst from the heat of the \"Pure Yang Pearl\", that intense swelling pain would definitely continue for a very long time.But now, not only did the blazing heat that had covered his entire body have disappeared, the countless dense and chapped wounds on his body had all started to heal as well. Most importantly, within the Dantian cauldron, the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" had already completely calmed down.\"I have to find more gems, especially some mid-grade gems for it to eat.\"Tang Huan thought that this little guy would also slowly grow up.Last time, it had to spend hundreds of low-grade gems before it could barely recover. This time, even thousands of low-grade gems might not be able to recover, but high-grade gems, this little guy could not digest them yet, but mid-grade gems were just right.\"Hmm \u2026\"Another soft, delicate cry rang out.Tang Huan was startled awake and looked over. She noticed that Shan Shan's soft and white body slightly twisted and she immediately stood up with Xiao Budian in her arms. She saw that Shan Shan's beautiful eyelashes were gently trembling, and after a moment, her eyes were wide open, revealing her beautiful black eyes.\"Tang Huan, how are you?\"After he opened his eyes, he was stunned for a long time. Only then did Shan Shan's consciousness return to her body, and in an instant, her expression changed and she struggled to sit up. However, she seemed to be exhausted and couldn't use any strength.\"I'm fine.\" Tang Huan was startled upon hearing this, and asked with some surprise. He obviously didn't understand why she would reveal such an expression.\"You \u2026 Your face. \"And your hand \u2026\" Shan Shan's eyes were sharp.\"Hand? \"Face?\"Tang Huan looked down, the back of his hand was covered densely in blood scabs, and after he wiped it on his face, the blood scabs rustled and fell, \"It's nothing, just some superficial wounds, they have all healed.\"Tang Huan didn't even need to look in the mirror to know that his current appearance was indeed terrifying.Otherwise, Shan Shan would not have such a reaction.However, it was only by looking at it that it seemed frightening. The scars on his skin were already rather minute, and after drinking the liquid from Xiao Budian's Golden Horn, it would take another two to three days for him to completely recover. Not even his scars would be left behind.Shan Shan sized up Tang Huan again, and seeing that there were indeed no obvious injuries on his face, he heaved a sigh of relief.\"How do you feel now?\"Tang Huan's gaze swept across Shan Shan's body and couldn't help but feel a little shaken. The current her looked completely different from before, when she was in a frozen state.\"I'm fine, but I don't have the strength to move. However, without the 'Pure Yang Pill Bead', I feel much more at ease. \"Shan Shan's lower brows unconsciously revealed a cheerful smile.But when she detected Tang Huan's gaze, her eyes immediately filled with shyness. Not only did a flush appear on her fair and charming face with a speed that could be seen with the naked eye, it also spread from her elegant neck to her soft breasts. She said in an uncontrollable manner, \"Tang Huan, you \u2026 \"You turn around \u2026\"\"Ah?\" \"Oh!\"Tang Huan came to his senses, and laughed involuntarily as he turned around, \"I think it's better if I go out first, I'll go ahead and call Grandma Zhang over later.\"\"Wait, you \u2026 \"Help me cover up the blanket first.\"Just as Tang Huan was about to reach the door, Shan Shan's thin voice sounded again from behind him.Turning his head to look, he saw that Shan Shan had already closed her beautiful eyes, her eyelashes were trembling, her round and ample chest was also moving up and down rapidly, and her tender and creamy skin was suffused with a faint crimson redness.Tang Huan took a deep breath and hurriedly walked forward. Using his fastest speed, he pulled up the thin blanket to cover her beautiful body, and then carried Xiao Budian out of the room in a few steps.Damn it, if he stayed any longer, he would probably embarrass himself.\"Puchi!\"Even though Shan Shan's eyes were closed, she could feel that Tang Huan's footsteps seemed to be somewhat miserable. With a quick thought, she could faintly guess what was going on and couldn't help but let out a charming laugh. Her beautiful eyes were like limpid autumn water and they were full of bashfulness.In the blink of an eye, an old woman with white hair entered the room.This was the Grandma Zhang.Without even needing Tang Huan to look for her, she had already appeared in the courtyard like a ghost.This old lady looked inconspicuous, but she was at least a Stage Seven Martial Master. With her taking care of Shan Shan, Tang Huan did not have to worry at all. After placing Xiao Budian who had curled up into a ball back into his room and bringing out the wooden chest containing the \"Yin Yang Profound Ice\", Tang Huan left the shop with the tens of low level weapons that he had forged a while ago.When Tang Huan returned, he already had a dozen or so middle ranked gems on his body.Tang Huan didn't leave a single one of them behind, he melted all of them into juice and fed them to Xiao Budian.Compared to Xiao Budian's consumption of energy this time, the dozen or so middle ranked gems were nothing at all. Seeing that Xiao Budian had no signs of waking up, Tang Huan knew that he had to leave the Furious Waves City.Tang Huan reckoned that if he opened his mouth, he would definitely be able to get a large amount of precious stones from her. However, he was still unable to do such a thing, and helping others to forge middle grade weapons might earn more precious stones, but it was far too slow for him to satisfy Xiao Budian's needs. Only by going to the place where a large number of middle grade precious stones were produced, would he be able to get an endless supply of precious stones.Feng Ming Mountain was precisely such a place.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: 89Early in the morning, in front of a restaurant near the west pier of the city, a beautiful figure stood gracefully.It was a young woman about eighteen or nineteen years old. She was tall, had delicate features, and a beautiful face. Her eyes were looking straight at the sea.She was Shan Shan.The sea breeze blew past, causing her long, flowing, waterfall like hair to fly behind her head. Her black robes fluttered about, and her graceful, curvy figure was clearly visible.Shan Shan gazed far into the distance, and within his line of sight, the guest boat was already riding the wind and breaking the waves, moving further and further away.When that small boat figure disappeared into the horizon, Shan Shan couldn't help but let out a faint sigh.\"Miss, this old servant has something to say, do you want to say it?\" Two to three meters behind Shan Shan, a white-haired old lady dressed in black suddenly spoke out.\"Grandma Zhang, if you have something to say, just say it.\" Shan Shan calmed her emotions and turned around, revealing a faint smile on her face.\"Miss, this Tang Huan fellow is indeed very outstanding.\"The black clad old woman squinted her eyes, a benevolent smile appearing on her wrinkled face, \"The physique of the five elements is metal, but it can stimulate a twelve meter long totem fire, and in a short ten days after successfully fusing with the True Fire, it will advance to Stage Four Martial Master and middle stage Weapon Refiner. Its future is limitless.\"\"Grandma Zhang, what exactly do you want to say?\" Shan Shan blinked her beautiful eyes doubtfully.\"I think Miss can ask this young man to stay, our family just happens to lack a male host.\" The old woman in black said with a smile.\"Missing a male host?\"Shan Shan was startled, and immediately understood the meaning of her words. A captivating captivating red immediately appeared on her delicate face, and she pouted: \"Grandma Zhang, why did you suddenly say that?\"\"Miss, in another year you will be twenty.\"\"Madam, when you were your age, you had already given birth to your brother for two years. Miss, you can't delay any longer. \"\"Mother \u2026 \"Big brother \u2026\"Shan Shan softly muttered these words, sadness leaking out from the depths of her eyes, but following that, Shan Shan's expression became stubborn, biting her red lips and said, \"If I don't get revenge for father, if I don't find big brother, I will definitely not agree on marriage. Grandma Zhang, we will return to Heavenly Forging City now! \"\"Miss, you \u2026\" No more thinking about it? \" The black-clothed old woman was stunned.\"I have already thought about it, I want to increase my cultivation as fast as possible, if I stay in Furious Waves City, it will be very inconvenient for me to cultivate!\"Shan Shan clenched his teeth and said.She had initially stayed by Tang Huan's side, but she was curious as to just what method Tang Huan had used to suppress the heat from the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" in her body. However, as time passed, she discovered that that fellow had already quietly broken into her heart. When she thought of him, she inexplicably felt joy.This unprecedented feeling made her feel both sweetness and fear.Now that Tang Huan had left the Furious Waves City, she was also determined to leave. If he did not leave now, he was afraid that he would never be willing to leave once Tang Huan returned.\"What about that young man?\" Feng Ming Mountain is an extremely dangerous place! \"\"With Grandpa Lu following us, nothing bad will happen.\"\"...\"\"Did that old man surnamed Lu follow us?\"Shan Shan and the old lady in black gradually disappeared into the distance. In the small restaurant opposite of them, a fat old man was holding a large bowl of noodles, eating happily while mumbling to himself, \"It seems that I can rest for this time \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.Riding on the wind and breaking the waves, the passenger ship finally traversed the vast waves of anger and arrived at Origin Continent in the evening.Upon entering the Crescent City, the feeling was completely different.Last time, Tang Huan was in a hurry, and did not even dare to spend the night in Crescent City in order to let the tracking Tang Family clansmen follow him. But this time, Tang Huan was much calmer.Because, his expression had already changed greatly.After nightfall, in the room of an inn in the northern part of the city, Tang Huan looked at the thin and unfamiliar face in the mirror and couldn't help but exclaim in his heart.This was the masterpiece of the Grandma Zhang.However, Grandma Zhang didn't have the help of any external objects. He immediately used his hands to massage Tang Huan's face continuously, and in less than a quarter of an hour, Tang Huan seemed to have become a completely different person.Such methods were truly amazing.Now, even if Tang Chao and Tang Hong were to stand in front of him, he would not be able to recognize that he was Tang Huan.Of course, if it was someone who was extremely familiar with Tang Huan, like the old fatty from the weapon shop, they would probably be able to recognize him with a single glance. Other than that, it would be very difficult to maintain this method for too long. In at most ten days, Tang Huan's appearance would gradually return to normal.For Tang Huan, ten days was enough.It was the ten-day journey from Crescent City to Feng Ming Mountain. After ten days, Tang Huan would reach the Phoenix City at the foot of Feng Ming's mountain.At that point, one could enter Feng Ming Mountain at any time.At that time, even if the Tang Family caught up, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack to find him in a place even wider than the Maze Realm Forest.\"Tang Family!\"Tang Huan laughed sinisterly, then carried Xiao Budian out of the cloth bag and placed him on the bed.The little fellow was still asleep, but after observing it carefully for a while, Tang Huan discovered that the golden horn on its head seemed to have lit up a little.Tang Huan's mind shook, he immediately grabbed the bag, and in a few moments, opened it, revealing the wooden box created by the \"Spirit Exquisite Tree\" inside. With a \"pa da\" sound, the lid of the box was opened and an exceptionally gorgeous and colorful light burst out. Following that, a variety of unique characteristics of Qi diffused out.All of the gems in this box were mid-grade!One hundred crystals!This was sent by the old man surnamed Lu that Shan Shan called after he found out about Xiao Budian's condition. When Tang Huan received the gems this morning, he was also greatly shocked. They were not ordinary mid-ranked gems, and every single one of them were extremely precious. At the very least, they were much more precious than the Heaven's Net Stone that would be rewarded during the competition.Tang Huan even suspected that the old man surnamed Lu had gone to all the Gem Store s last night and swept clean all the precious mid-ranked gems.Of course, no matter how he obtained these gems, Tang Huan didn't reject Shan Shan's kind intentions. Furthermore, he had solved his desperate situation with these gems. However, with Xiao Budian's current condition, it was still unknown whether he could recover using a hundred middle ranked gems.\"Hu!\"Casually grabbing a green middle ranked gem, a small ball of flame appeared in Tang Huan's palm. Although this flame was not big, the heat it contained was incomparably fierce. In less than a quarter of an hour, the middle ranked gem in his palm had turned into a small puddle of sticky green liquid.After he refined this pile of sap and removed all of the impurities within it, Tang Huan then opened his mouth and poured the impurities into it. Then, he began to refine the second gem.After feeding Xiao Budian ten middle ranked gems worth of solution, Tang Huan finally stopped and started to cultivate.Inside the Dantian, the \"Nine Yang Divine Furnace\" and the \"Spiritual Wheel were revolving rapidly.\" Tang Huan calmed his mind and slowly refined the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" that was lured out from Shan Shan's body.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: 90A road that was dozens of meters wide, winding like a giant dragon, intersecting high mountains. [] [Table of Contents]At dusk, the sound of rolling wheels slowly echoed out, and a convoy of 12 carriages slowly arrived. Each carriage was tied up with a large wooden chest, and at the front and back of the carriage, there were over twenty riders, all young men and women.\"Everyone, let's work harder. I think in at most half an hour, we'll be able to reach the 'Phoenix City' in front. When we get there, all of your rewards will increase by 50%.\" A middle-aged man with a friendly face laughed loudly on the carriage at the front.\"Alright!\"A chorus of agreement broke out among the surrounding people, and they all revealed smiles on their faces.The Phoenix City was at the foot of the mountain of Feng Ming, which was also the destination of the convoy.However, whether it was the middle-aged man or the surrounding youths, when they were joking, their eyes inadvertently glanced at a silent black-clothed youth in the convoy.He wore a yellow mask on his face, revealing only his mouth, nose and eyes. Strangely, however, for twelve hours a day, his eyes had been closed for at least twenty hours.The black-robed youth was none other than Tang Huan.After staying in Crescent City for the night, Tang Huan bought his horses, tents, and rations early the next morning, and left Crescent City.He did not plan to travel alone. It would take him ten days to travel from the Crescent City to the Phoenix City below the mountain of Feng Ming. On the way, he would need to pass through countless forests and not have any towns to rest.Relatively speaking, it would be much safer to find someone to travel with.Once they reached the north side of the city, they would bump into this convoy that was recruiting guards, and the Martial Warriors that they recruited would at least have the strength of a Stage Four Martial Master. If it was the Stage Four Martial Master, one could get 100 gold coins when entering the Phoenix City, and if it was the Stage Five Martial Master, they could get 400 gold coins.Tang Huan happened to be a Stage Four Martial Master, so without much hesitation, he immediately joined.Although a hundred gold coins was not a lot, but in the journey ahead, with many Martial Warriors s accompanying him and also receiving a reward, why not?Around noon, the team gathered their men and began to set off.In the group, there were thirteen people, all from Stage Four Martial Master, and the middle-aged man who was the owner of the group was from Stage Five Martial Master. Amongst them, Tang Huan and the rest of the twenty-three were Stage Four Martial Master, while the remaining young man called Yin Fei was Stage Five Martial Master.On the first day, everyone got along quite well.On the second day, Tang Huan discovered that there were some changes to his face, and so he put on the mask that he had prepared in advance.However, his actions caused everyone to be suspicious of him. Even the eyes of the middle-aged man and the others had an additional trace of wariness when they looked at him.Tang Huan did not mind.If he didn't wear the mask, he would change his appearance every day, which would most likely cause everyone to be even more suspicious. Moreover, he would leave alone for a while every evening to refine the gem for Xiao Budian to consume. This would also cause people to be suspicious of him.In any case, he was destined to be suspected anyway. Thus, he might as well wear a mask.After that, no one spoke with Tang Huan anymore. He was happy to hear them, and continuously refined the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" every day, not stopping even when he was on horseback.The heat emitted by the \"Pure Yang Pearl\" was extremely wonderful. Not only could it increase the \"True Fire\", it could also increase the strength of the Genuine Qi at an extremely obvious rate.In ten days, within Tang Huan's Dantian, the second stage of Spiritual Wheel was already in its initial form.Tang Huan reckoned that if he continued this kind of cultivation, in at most another ten days, he would reach great success in the second stage of Spiritual Wheel and be promoted to Stage Five Martial Master.And at that time, the \"Pure Yang Pill Bead\" would not even have half the heat of it being refined, and the remaining heat would be enough for him to condense the third stage of Spiritual Wheel and become a Stage Six Martial Master!Thinking of this, Tang Huan felt extremely grateful towards Shan Shan.\"She should have left the Furious Waves City by now, right?\"As the image of Shan Shan's flawless face flashed in his mind, Tang Huan's heart could not help but throb, but in an instant, a sense of loss surfaced in the bottom of his heart.was quite interested in this beautiful woman who came from a mysterious background.When he bid his farewell to her, Tang Huan had wanted to invite her to go with him to Feng Ming Mountain, but the words were already on his lips but he resisted. He could feel that Shan Shan did indeed have the intention to leave the Furious Waves City, but he didn't have the intention to stay by her side.Since that was the case, they might as well part from each other.Tang Huan let out a light breath, suppressing the charming feeling at the bottom of his heart.\"Yiya!\"Suddenly, an almost inaudible bird cry sounded.Xiao Budian woke up?After being stunned for a short while, Tang Huan was overjoyed. He stealthily galloped his horse and hid behind a young man, avoiding the gazes of everyone in front. He then gently lifted the cloth sack on his chest, only to discover that the little guy was still sleeping soundly, and was only mumbling nonstop.Although its cries were as soft as a mosquito's buzz, Tang Huan could feel a trace of anxiety within its shouts.\"Could it be that there's danger ahead?\"Tang Huan couldn't help but be moved. He had interacted with Xiao Budian for so many days, he could easily judge the meaning behind its voice.\"I understand. You can sleep in peace.\"Tang Huan muttered softly. His palm went deep into the cloth bag and gently stroked its head a few times. Xiao Budian seemed to understand his meaning and immediately quietened down, continuing his sleep.After ten days, most of the gems in the wooden box had been used up.Although Xiao Budian had yet to open its eyes, the color of the Golden Horn on top of its head had become even brighter. It was obvious that it had recovered by quite a bit, because if it had, it would not have been able to sense danger while it was sleeping and alert Tang Huan with its voice.Tang Huan raised his head to look, the sun had already set and the sky was turning dark.\"Take people's money and let them get away with it.\"After a moment of hesitation, Tang Huan spurred his horse forward.After all, they had already received half of the guards' pay before leaving. Now that they had been warned, it would be beneficial for them to be extra careful.However, his action immediately attracted a lot of attention.\"Little brother, what's the matter?\" Seeing Tang Huan approaching, the middle aged man chuckled and asked, but his eyes revealed a sense of vigilance.\"Boss Du, we have to be careful. I'm afraid there's danger ahead.\" Tang Huan slowly said.\"Oh? Is there any danger? \"Elder Du didn't deny it and smiled, but a trace of ridicule seemed to flash within his eyes as he cupped his hands and said, \"Then, I thank little brother for your good intentions.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: 91Just by looking at its expression, Tang Huan could tell that this boss called Du Xi did not believe his warning.Not only did he not believe it, it was likely that he was the most dangerous factor in Du Xi's eyes. After all, in the past ten days, his actions had been too suspicious.This could be seen from the eyes of the people around him, as if they were guarding against thieves.When he was approaching Du Xi, many of the Martial Warriors s had placed their hands on their weapons, and after hearing his words, they too acted like Du Xi, their expressions full of ridicule.Tang Huan was too lazy to explain. He pulled the reins and stopped his horse.As the carriage continued forward, a tall and sturdy young man who was passing by Tang Huan and glanced at him fiercely before laughing out loud, \"You were pretending to be mysterious, but now you are reminding us that there's danger ahead. Isn't that funny?\"\"That's right, that's right. In my opinion, he is the one who is in danger.\"\"The Phoenix City is right in front of us, what danger can it be? Everyone, don't believe him. There was originally nothing much to do, so don't let him make you suspect anything. \"\"Maybe this is his goal. We have to mess things up so that he will have a chance to make a move!\"\"...\"The moment the burly man finished speaking, laughter filled the air.Tang Huan did not mind, and continued to follow at the back of the carriage. After reminding Du Xi and the others, he had done his best. As for whether they believed it or not, it had nothing to do with him.If he really met with irresistible danger, he would definitely take the opportunity to leave the group.His and the surrounding guards' duties were actually only to deal with the beasts' attacks. They had already repelled quite a few waves of attacks along the way. Dozens of wild beasts had died under Tang Huan's spear, it could be said that they were unworthy of the fifty gold coins, there was no need to throw your life away.Not long later, the group passed through a hundred meter open area and entered a forest.In the forest, the lighting was getting dimmer and dimmer.The surrounding Martial Warriors s continued to talk and laugh. They would mock Tang Huan from time to time, as if they did not feel that there was any danger that would come at this time. This place was not very far from the Phoenix City, so very few people would choose to rob here.However, Tang Huan was different from them. He firmly believed Xiao Budian's words.Tang Huan guessed that the danger was very likely to be hidden in the forest.As a result, almost at the instant he entered the forest, Tang Huan activated the \"Qi of Heaven and Earth\" to its limits. The Spiritual Wheel in his body rotated extremely quickly, and within the Spiritual Meridian, the Genuine Qi began to surge like water. In that moment, Tang Huan's senses were raised to their limit.\"Hmm?\"After a moment, Tang Huan raised his eyebrows and muttered.\"Chi!\" \"Chi!\" \"Swish \u2026\" In Tang Huan's line of sight, he suddenly saw a string of slender black shadows shoot out from the forest without any warning, flashing across the sky like lightning towards the ten Stage Four Martial Master s in the convoy. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"\"There's someone in the forest!\"\"Be careful!\"\"Those are arrows!\"\"...\"Shouts of surprise suddenly rose and fell.Tang Huan remained calm and reacted even faster than everyone in the convoy. The moment the sound of breaking air rang, Tang Huan had already removed the Crimson Flame Spear and amidst a buzzing sound, the black strips wrapped around the spear's body quickly fell off. The long spear transformed into a blazing red light and pierced behind him like lightning.\"Ding!\" \"Ding!\" In a moment, Tang Huan felt the tip of his spear trembling, two metal clashing sounds erupted out at almost the same time.\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" \"Ah \u2026\"It was at this moment that cries of pain sounded out continuously.Some of them had been shot in the arms, and some had even been shot in the chest. On the left, right, and right, ten black clothed men appeared almost at the same time, all holding longbows in their hands, their faces covered with black cloth.Two eyes swept over, Tang Huan then looked behind him in the blink of an eye.On the road two to three meters away, two long black arrows dropped, and on the roadside about twenty meters away stood two men dressed in black clothing. Both of them wore the same attire, and when they looked at Tang Huan, their eyes revealed expressions of shock.In the carriage at the front, Du Xi's expression changed greatly, as though he did not expect that Tang Huan's words were true, that there would actually be people robbing near the Phoenix City, and that all of them were extremely strong, if not it would not be possible for them to injure so many people in the convoy by relying on just their bows.However, since Du Xi dared to bring his convoy of goods to the Phoenix City, he must have seen many storms before, so he quickly calmed down. With great difficulty, he forced out a smile, cupped his hands together, and shouted: \"My friends, we are here!\"\"Kill!\" \"Leave no one alive!\"Before Du Xi could finish speaking, one of the black clothed man shouted out, following that, the 12 of them threw away their bows, drew their weapons and pounced forward.Seeing that, Du Xi's face became extremely ugly, but he immediately took out an egg sized red ball from his bosom, and gently pinched it, causing a \"peng\" sound. A ball of red light soared into the sky, instantly exploding thousands of meters above, like fireworks, it was extremely dazzling.Perhaps the twelve black clothed men had already expected this action from Du Xi, and their footsteps were not affected in the slightest.\"He... They are all Stage Five Martial Master \u2026 \"But at this time, among the Martial Warriors guards, a young man shouted in shock.The enemy consisted of twelve Stage Five Martial Master s, while their own side only consisted of two Stage Five Martial Master s, Du Xi and Yin Fei. The difference in strength between the two of them was simply too great, if they forcefully resisted, they would be completely annihilated.In the blink of an eye, someone turned their gaze towards the gap between the man in black, wanting to escape.\"Everyone, don't panic! I have already given the signal that there will be experts reinforcements from the Phoenix City soon. \"Sensing his surroundings, Du Xi's expression became even uglier, and quickly shouted out. But in the next moment, he did not care about anything else, with his right hand extended, he retrieved his blade from the carriage with the fastest speed possible, and rushed forward to meet the black clothed man who was rushing towards him.Twelve Stage Five Martial Master came over, and attacked the moment they appeared, not giving Du Xi the slightest chance to finish his words, as they even had the intention to kill him \u2026No matter how he looked at it, it did not seem normal.Generally speaking, the reason for the robbery was to obtain money, not to kill, but the other party actually wanted to kill all the people in the convoy, either because the other party was Du Xi himself or the person who was an enemy of his merchant guild, or because the goods delivered by the convoy were extraordinary.Tang Huan didn't want to get involved, so he wanted to make use of this opportunity to escape from the beginning. However, he quickly discovered that the other party had not given him this opportunity.One of the two men in black behind him actually brandished his hammer and dashed towards him. The hammer was as big as a washbasin, and its handle was about one meter long. It looked extremely heavy, and its entire body was emitting a strong golden light. It seemed as if it was emitting an extremely violent aura.\"Qingfeng Floating Feather\", the role of \"Yin Fei\" that this friend has set, has appeared.

    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: 92Seeing that, a sneer appeared on Tang Huan's face. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"With a slight push of his legs, his body left the saddle and flew up into the air. The Crimson Flame Spear in his hands released a hum and burst forth with an incomparably bright and dazzling red light, and the spear's body was like a fire dragon that had left its lair.Seeing Tang Huan's attack, the black clothed man's eyes flashed with ridicule, the sledgehammer in his hand whizzed forward.\"Bam!\"In a split-second, the tip of the fiery red spear fell on the hammer's body.Amidst the loud clanging sounds, the unstoppable Strength Qi swept out in all directions, and as though the black clothed man had suffered a heavy blow, he only had enough time to exclaim in shock, before he was thrown out along with his hammer, smashing heavily onto the ground a few metres away. Dust and sand flew in all directions, and a pit even appeared on the ground from the large hammer.In the next moment, the man in black leaped up, but before he could even stabilize himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed onto the black cloth that covered his face. Although his right hand was still holding the large golden hammer, both of his arms were trembling.\"Huh?\"Not too far away, a tall black clothed man who had just cut a Stage Four Martial Master in half and saw this scene couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.In the next moment, the two meter long broadblade in his hand pointed towards the Tang Huan that had just landed on the ground.\"Be careful, there's something strange about this Stage Four Martial Master!\" When the black-clothed man holding the large golden hammer saw this, he could not help but shout out a reminder.\"Humph!\"The big sized man snorted coldly, he took a big leap and the long blade in his hand turned into a green rainbow, whizzing towards Tang Huan.The saber stroke was simple and direct, without any superfluous movements. Wherever the long blade passed by, it seemed to create a cyan storm, causing sand and rocks to fly and rocks to fly. Its momentum was like thunder, and even if there was a hill in front of it, it would still be split into two halves by the cyan blade.\"Hu!\" Tang Huan's eyes flashed, the Crimson Flame Spear in his hand wiggled like a spirit serpent, and directly swept out.\"Ding!\"In a split-second, the clash of swords and spears not only raised an ear-piercing sound, but also a violent heat wave that rolled in all directions along with the fluctuations of the Strength Qi.In an instant, the tall man felt as if the long saber in his hand had been ruthlessly struck by a gigantic hammer.Soon after, not only was his palms stinging, his arms tingling, and his blood was surging within his chest, the longblade in his hand involuntarily tilted to the side from the impact, almost falling out of his hands. He held on tightly to the hilt of his saber, yet his whole body was being pulled by it as he staggered.Tang Huan squinted his eyes, he did not chase after the tall man, nor did he turn his head, but it was as if he had eyes at the back of his head. The captivating red Crimson Flame Spear twisted its body, and turned the tip of the spear, piercing behind it.At this moment, behind Tang Huan, the black clothed man had already taken advantage of the time while he was fighting with his companion and smashed out with the golden hammer in his hand.At the end of the hammer's handle, a golden chain was pulled out and held in the black clothed man's hand. As for the huge hammer, it was like a meteorite falling from outer space, as it smashed towards Tang Huan's back with a speed that was hard to see with the naked eye.\"Bam!\"In the blink of an eye, the tip of the spear pierced the hammer.At this moment, even the surrounding space seemed to tremble slightly. The corner of Tang Huan's mouth curled slightly, and with a flick of the fiery red spear, the golden sledgehammer flew back at an even faster speed. The black-clothed man did not even have time to react before his chest was struck ruthlessly by his own sledgehammer.\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"With a miserable scream, the man in black fell more than ten meters away with his hammer.After the golden hammer landed on the ground, it rolled to the side and gradually dimmed. His four limbs were twitching, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His chest had caved in, and he was clearly unable to live.\"Tan Yuan!\"Looking at his miserable companion on the ground, he could not believe his eyes. How could a dignified Stage Five Martial Master be smashed to death by his own weapon in such a pathetic manner?This masked guy was this strong? But the intelligence clearly said that he was just a Stage Four Martial Master!The Stage Four Martial Master could actually be killed this easily?What a joke, there must be a mistake in the information!He is definitely a top Stage Five Martial Master, or even \u2026 Stage Six Martial Master!The tall man's heart trembled, and fear uncontrollably welled up from the bottom of his heart. But at this time, the intense trembling sounds drilled into his ears once again, and a fiery red spear flower began to rapidly expand in his pupils.\"Kill!\"The tall man suppressed the fear in his heart and stepped to the side. Staring at the bell eyes, he roared out loud. The long blade in his hand slashed towards the Fire Red Long Spear that was thrusting towards him.This slash seemed to have infused all the Genuine Qi in his body, and the wide blade exploded with an extremely dazzling green light.Whoosh! Wherever the long blade passed, an incomparably sharp and fierce aura surged like stormy waves, crazily surging and tearing through the void, dragging a sharp whistling sound behind it.\"Buzz!\"The spear in Tang Huan's hand shook as if it was alive, and then like a fire dragon turning over, it weaved around the blade's edge in an extremely strange manner.\"Bam!\"After a short moment, the green blade fell to the ground.Amidst an earth-shaking ringing sound, dust and sand rolled up, creating two waves that were several meters tall. On the ground, there was an additional crack that was two meters long.The power of this strike was extremely shocking.However, the tall man felt his hands and feet go cold, and an uncontrollable chill arose in his heart. Indeed, the moment the long saber fell to the ground, he felt a wave of heat rushing towards him.\"Retreat!\"The tall man's eyes were filled with fear and shock. He let go of the hilt without any hesitation and wanted to retreat. However, the momentum of the red streak of light had completely exceeded his expectations. Just as he let go of his fingers, a piercing pain exploded in his chest.\"Clang!\"The moment the long saber fell onto the ground, the tall man's eyes widened. He looked down and saw that the fiery red spear tip had already pierced into his chest.Faintly, the sizzling sound of burnt flesh could be heard from within his body. The tall man's eyes were filled with despair as he emitted a series of vague sounds from his throat, seeming as if he wanted to say something.Tang Huan's eyes flashed, his long spear raised slightly, as the black clad man's large body flew up into the air, flying towards his companion's side.\"Hu!\"Taking a light breath, Tang Huan retracted his spear and stood still, his two eyes quickly swept across the area.Not far away, the Stage Four Martial Master who had just escaped from a calamity stared at Tang Huan in shock. Not only was his face filled with shock, his mouth was so wide open that a fist could be stuffed inside.Author's Note: The dead dragon 'Tan Yuan' appeared. Although he wasn't killed by his own iron claw, he was still killed by his own weapon.

    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: 93When he was sent flying with a slash of his sword by the tall man, his heart was filled with despair. In front of the Stage Five Martial Master, he basically had no strength to retaliate.That tall man only needed one more blade to completely kill him.But just when he had no hope of surviving, his opponent was lured away by Tang Huan.He was originally a little surprised, Tang Huan was the same as him, also a Stage Four Martial Master, how could he beat back the other black-clothed man who was also a Stage Five Martial Master? At one point in time, he even thought that Tang Huan was probably their spy, and what happened just now was merely two people putting on a show.However, the scene that followed left him dumbstruck.From the very beginning, it had only been a few breaths' time, and Tang Huan had only released four shots, but he had easily killed two Stage Five Martial Master s!Such an outcome was too unbelievable.If not for the two dead Stage Five Martial Master lying on the road, he would have thought that he was mistaken!Where did this strange fellow come from?Could it be that he was a Stage Five Martial Master, or perhaps he had been hiding his cultivation, making others think that he was just a Stage Four Martial Master?The possibility of this was extremely high, otherwise, how could a mere Stage Four Martial Master kill two Stage Five Martial Master so easily!Thinking of this, he couldn't help but shiver.Prior to this, he had mocked and ridiculed that fellow several times. With that fellow's tyrannical strength, he wouldn't find an opportunity to take revenge, right? In the blink of an eye, he had become quite fearful.At this time, both sides were just like him, stunned by the sudden turn of events. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"Regardless of whether it was Du Xi, Yin Fei or the other carriages' Martial Warriors s, or the black-clothed men, all of them had expressions of shock that were difficult to conceal.Especially Du Xi and Yin Fei, the two of them.They were both Stage Five Martial Master and their opponents were both Stage Five Martial Master. Even though they struggled to fight, they were only on par with each other, but Tang Huan managed to finish off the two Stage Five Martial Master s in a few moments.The strength that Tang Huan had displayed greatly shocked both of them.They had originally thought that Tang Huan was only a Stage Four Martial Master, and because of that, even though they suspected his intentions and intentions, they did not chase him away. Instead, they allowed him to stay in the carriage, as they thought about it, as long as Tang Huan made any move, they could easily kill him.But now, they realized just how strong Tang Huan was, had actually surpassed them by far.Before this, when they heard Tang Huan's reminder, the two scoffed disdainfully and did not take it to heart. Even when the dozen or so black-clothed men appeared, they still thought that Tang Huan was the spy and accomplice of this group of people.At this moment, they realized that they were extremely wrong.If Tang Huan had warned him, he would have stopped right outside the forest and released a signal. He would be ready for battle, how would he have been caught unprepared by his opponent?The group of black clothed men exchanged glances, bewildered.For a time, the dark forest road descended into an abnormal silence.\"You! You! You! \"You!\"On the opposite side of Du Xi, the black clothed man suddenly pointed at the four people not far away, and with a fierce look in his eyes he bellowed: \"Attack together, kill him!\" As for him and his companions, they moved once again and attacked the two Stage Five Martial Master s, Du Xi and Du Xi.\"Yes sir!\"Just as he finished speaking, the four men in black who were pointed out immediately gave up on chasing after the nearby Stage Four Martial Master, and pounced towards Tang Huan from different directions.The black clothed man moved in succession, the fierce battle once again erupted.Seeing the four of them approaching, Tang Huan frowned, at first he only wanted to escape, he did not want to get entangled with them, but now that he had killed two of them, it was impossible for him to stay out of this matter.\"Since that's the case, we might as well have a good fight.\"Tang Huan took a deep breath, and a cold aura swept past his eyes.Although it had only been a short ten days or so and he was still a Stage Four Martial Master, his strength had improved tremendously compared to when he had fought with Mo Ye initially. This progress was not only reflected in his Genuine Qi and Genuine Qi, but also reflected his comprehension of the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\".Just now, he had only used four shots, and he had easily killed two of the Stage Five Martial Master s.In a moment, Tang Huan had already made up his mind. He immediately picked up the Crimson Flame Spear and leaped forward as if he was flying, his speed was as fast as a wild horse struggling off its reins. In the blink of an eye, the distance between Tang Huan and the black clothed man who was the fastest was already less than three meters.The man in black was short and thin, and each of his hands held a dark, sharp dagger.\"Brat, you're dead this time!\"Before he finished speaking, his body suddenly collapsed onto the ground like a spirit serpent. He moved and flickered on the ground like a spirit serpent, fluctuating from east to west and back to front. His movements were erratic, making them hard to follow.Tang Huan's eyes turned serious, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.The thin man's eyes revealed a complacent look, and his movements became even more unpredictable.\"An insignificant skill!\"Tang Huan suddenly sneered, the Crimson Flame Spear in his hand suddenly spun, and thrusted towards the figure on the ground in front of him as fast as lightning, spear after spear, his spear was actually as fast as lightning.With every thrust of the spear, a scorching heat would spread out.The longspear was like a dragon, and its imposing manner was like a rainbow. In the blink of an eye, Tang Huan had stabbed out over a dozen spears at a speed that the naked eye could not catch.\"Seriously... The power of the True Fire, you are the Weapon Refiner! \"The thin man screamed in surprise. The complacency in his eyes instantly disappeared.His body felt like it was about to melt. Then, like a kitten who was stepping on a soldering iron, he suddenly jumped up from the ground and quickly retreated, wanting to escape from the furnace.\"Chi!\"However, the moment he sprung up, the Fire Red Long Spear also leapt up and followed after him like a shadow.The thin man's eyes were filled with shock. The daggers in his hands slashed forward at an extremely tricky angle, and after a short moment, the daggers had stuck onto the tip of the spear.However, at that instant, the sharp tip of the spear was less than two inches away from his chest. The warmth that was emitted from the tip of the sword even made the clothes on his chest frown. Not only that, the power that was surging around the spearhead was extremely powerful, making him feel as if he couldn't control it.He had a premonition that in one or two breaths of time at most, the spear would break free from the control of the dagger in his hands and pierce into his chest. And at this time, he simply couldn't let go of it.\"Save me, save me \u2026\"The thin man couldn't help but scream out in extreme terror.Almost at the same time as his words left his mouth,Two black long blades and a white heavy sword hacked towards Tang Huan at the same time. In an instant, the strong wind whistled and the sharp sound of the blade and sword tearing through space made everyone's scalp tingle.Tang Huan pulled back the spear in his hand, immediately escaping from the dagger's clip.After the thin man had survived the tribulation, his legs weakened and he sat on the ground in exhaustion. However, Tang Huan's spear was like a fire dragon, pointing, piercing, piercing, sweeping, smashing \u2026 The power of the spear kept changing unpredictably as it fought fiercely with the three men in black. Strength Qi swirled violently as sounds of explosions rang out incessantly.The thin man gasped for breath before finally regaining his senses. The anger in his eyes flickered as he instantly leaped up and grit his teeth as he joined the battle.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: 94Tang Huan fought three alone and was not at a disadvantage. Even after the skinny man joined the fray and fought four alone, he still appeared to be skillful enough.The more the battle progressed, the more shocked the four men became.From the beginning till the end, Tang Huan did not use any offensive skills, the spear in his hand only displayed the most basic movements of a spear.However, every spear strike was astonishingly fast, and every spear strike contained an extremely powerful Genuine Qi. Even if his movements were extremely simple and direct, it was still able to display an extremely great amount of power.Especially at the instant when their weapons clashed, the explosive power of Tang Huan's spear was even more terrifying, and had nearly caused the four's weapons to fly out of their hands on multiple occasions.However, what caused the four of them to tremble the most was still the heat emitted from the spear.The space within a two meter radius around Tang Huan seemed to be ignited with blazing flames, and after being slightly in contact, it was extremely hot. In just a short while, under the assault of the heat, the four of them were already drenched in sweat, and their clothes were completely soaked.\"Could it be that this fellow is not only a Stage Six Martial Master, but also a high ranking Weapon Refiner? Otherwise, how could the power of the True Fire be so strong?\"The thin man felt even more astonished. From time to time, he would look at his companion, and he could see the shock in his companion's eyes, which was getting denser and denser.While the four Stage Five Martial Master s struggled to surround and attack him, Tang Huan grew braver and braver.The more he fought, the more he felt that the \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" was incomparably marvelous. Unknowingly, he seemed to be immersed in an extremely mystical state of mind.Unknowingly, Tang Huan seemed to have touched the threshold of the second style of \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\".This \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\" had a total of six forms. The first was \"Prairie Blaze\", the second was \"Beacon Smoke\", together with the smoke of the beacon, the war was about to begin, this style contained an extremely strong killing intent, within the spear's aura, there seemed to be the sound of a golden spear and iron horse roaring that shook the mind.In a trance, Tang Huan seemed to have caught on to something and fiercely thrusted his spear forward.\"Boom!\"A monstrous heat wave shot into the sky like a pillar of smoke, and an incomparably violent killing intent quickly spread out. This space with a radius of a few meters seemed to have turned into the miniature image of a battlefield, with metallic hooves rumbling, sword lights, bloody streams of light, and murderous intent filling the air.At this moment, the four men couldn't help but reveal expressions of shock.The fiery red spear tip was clearly not pointing at anyone, but they all felt that they were the target. They felt as if they were firmly locked on by the spear tip, unable to dodge or evade it.All four of them felt their bodies stiffen as fear and despair spread through their hearts.However, just when the four of them felt that they were dead meat, the Fire Red Long Spear suddenly stopped in mid air, and the terrifying killing intent instantly dissipated.\"What a pity!\"Tang Huan suddenly woke up from that wondrous state, feeling a bit of regret in his heart.When the second form of \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\", \"Beacon Smoke\", was executed, he immediately felt that his strength was not enough, and understood that this move could probably only be used after he had condensed the second stage of Spiritual Wheel and advanced to Stage Five Martial Master.However, Tang Huan's regret was quickly washed away by his happiness.Even if he could not use it now, he had already comprehended the profoundness of the \"beacon smoke\". Once he became a Stage Five Martial Master in the future, he would be able to use this move naturally.\"Retreat!\"The thin man and the other three walked through the door to hell, as if they had just woken up from a dream, and the word flashed in their minds almost at the same time. However, before they could take action, the Fire Red Long Spear in the air moved again. This time it was towards the skinny man.Circle after circle of spear shadows bloomed like tiny sparks. They instantly merged into one and turned into a prairie fire.\"Chi!\" \"Swish \u2026\"The thin man felt as if a huge ball of fire was pressing down on him. He was immediately scared out of his wits and quickly retreated. The two daggers in his hands crazily danced and the two black lights became bigger and bigger like snowballs.Ding! Ding!After two intense cracking sounds, the captivating red flame and the two black spheres of light simultaneously exploded and dissipated.The two daggers in the thin man's hand were pressed tightly against the fiery red spear shaft, but on his neck, a bright red spear tip had entered his body. The black cloth covering his face, hair, and even his clothes were all burnt by the heat of the spear.Tang Huan's right hand trembled, and the spearhead was pulled out.Immediately after, two \"Dingdang\" sounds rang out and the dagger fell to the ground. The skinny man didn't even have the chance to make a sound as he fell onto the ground with his eyes wide open.The other three men in black had just brandished their weapons in preparation for rescue when their companions were shot through the throats.This sudden turn of events completely scared them silly. It wasn't until Tang Huan looked over in the blink of an eye that the three of them woke up, all of them covered in cold sweat from shock.\"Run!\" In the next moment, the three of them had completely lost the courage to fight Tang Huan, and with a shout, they scattered and ran in three different directions.\"Idiot!\"Tang Huan sneered. His spear was like a streak of fiery red lightning, aiming straight for the black clothed man who had the slowest reaction. If the three of them fought back with all their might and waited for their companions to arrive, they might not die. However, running away like this was like waiting to be slaughtered a lamb.After the lightning fast shot, the man in black fell to the ground with a howl.Tang Huan dodged and jumped, catching up to another man in black clothing. That guy's eyes were bloodshot, he roared and slashed with his sword, although he used a large amount of Genuine Qi, but it was completely useless, and before he could even touch Tang Huan's weapon, Tang Huan's Crimson Flame Spear had already pierced through his chest.\"Help, help, help \u2026\"The last black-clothed man was so frightened that he began to hysterically cry out for help again and again. Unfortunately, before he could finish his words, his voice suddenly stopped and his body froze in place.The commotion had shocked the crowd once again.Previously, the number of black-clothed men chasing after Martial Warriors s of the fourth stage had decreased to a large number, but Du Xi and Yin Fei's opponents had increased by one each.With their strength, they could deal with just one Stage Five Martial Master, but dealing with two would be easy. Especially Du Xi, the boss of the convoy, he had to occasionally observe his surroundings. In a short period of time, their wounds had increased by quite a bit.However, just as the two of them were in danger, they discovered to their astonishment that the other side had actually stopped attacking.The two of them panted and looked over in the blink of an eye, just in time to see the scene of Tang Huan killing the last black-clothed man with one shot.In such a short time, he killed four Stage Five Martial Master s in a row?Adding the two people from before, that meant there were six of them!'s and Yin Fei's eyes almost popped out of their sockets as the number flashed across their minds. Not only them, the remaining six men in black were also speechless. Before this, they had seen both sides fighting back and forth. Who would have thought that after a flick of a finger, the situation would change drastically?[] [Table of Contents] [] [Table of Contents]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: 95\"Boom \u2026\" At this moment, the ground suddenly shook slightly. There was a faint rumbling sound coming from the distance, and it actually became louder and louder. \"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love!\"\"Reinforcements are coming!\" Du Xi's eyes lit up and he could not help but laugh out loud.\"Retreat!\"In front of Du Xi, a man dressed in black seemed to have woken up from a dream, and looked at Tang Huan fiercely.\"Stop!\" You won't be able to escape! \"Du Xi bellowed, but was powerless to stop them.The remaining men in black also came back to their senses. They moved almost at the same time. They didn't even have time to take away their companions' corpses. In just a short moment, they had vanished without a trace.Once they left, the remaining Martial Warriors s all sat down on the ground.Although the goods on the carriage weren't lost, the fierce battle just now had caused the area to lose a lot of corpses. Out of the six black clothed men, seven or eight of the Martial Warriors s had been killed, and more than twenty were still alive.Tang Huan retracted his gaze, retrieved the cloth strip and wrapped it around the Crimson Flame Spear.Just from the looks of the men in black before they left, Tang Huan knew that they would probably hold a grudge against him. However, Tang Huan did not care, he was wearing a mask now, and after taking it off, he would be dressed up, as long as he was careful not to reveal his weapon, it would not be easy to recognize him.\"Little brother, I am truly sorry. I misunderstood you. If it wasn't for you, none of us would have survived.\"A voice suddenly came out, but Du Xi walked over to Tang Huan's side with a limp. His face was filled with shame and regret.His face was delicate and pretty, his body was tall and slender, long hair flowed behind his head, and he held a black spear in his hand. A long and narrow wound extended from his left shoulder to his right rib, and between his chest and abdomen, it was completely dyed red with blood.This man was Yin Fei, the second Stage Five Martial Master in the convoy.\"Brother Ye, I was wrong to blame you these few days. I thought that you didn't have any plans, and that I would be disrespectful to you. Please forgive me, little brother.\" Yin Fei also cupped his hands, with an apologetic look in his eyes.\"It's fine.\"After Tang Huan heard this, he smiled faintly.When he had applied for the position of guard in the convoy, he had not used his real name, but rather used a fake name, called \"Ye Ze.\" This was actually the name of a student of his from his previous life.Hearing Tang Huan's words, Du Xi and Yin Fei felt even more guilty, and the surrounding Martial Warriors s couldn't help but lower their heads in shame. [] [Table of Contents]Along the way, although Tang Huan was following the convoy, he was isolated by the crowd.Even until the moment that group of black-clothed men appeared, the Martial Warriors closer to Tang Huan were still on guard against his sneak attack. However, no one expected that this person, who looked like he was on guard against a thief, would actually become their savior in the end.Just as Du Xi had said, if not for Tang Huan, the entire convoy would have been completely annihilated.Tang Huan had first quickly killed two Stage Five Martial Master s, then attracted four Stage Four Martial Master s from the other party. Otherwise, as long as six people attacked Du Xi and Yin Fei together, the six of them could easily end the battle.At that time, even if reinforcements were to arrive, they would only be able to see the corpses on the ground.\"Little brother is magnanimous, but it makes me feel even more ashamed.\"Du Xi regretfully sighed, and looked at them in the blink of an eye with a bitter smile on his face, \"If I had heard Little Brother's reminder earlier, my losses wouldn't have been so heavy.\"Tang Huan hung his spear at his back and remained silent, but his heart was filled with guesses.This robbery that suddenly appeared was extremely strange.Du Xi was merely a Stage Five Martial Master. If one were to talk about seeking revenge, it was definitely impossible to attract twelve Stage Five Martial Master. If Tang Huan's guess was right, the other party most likely still came for the goods.According to Tang Huan's knowledge, all these carriages were carrying hematite. But now it seems that the hematite was most likely just to hide it, to actually transport something that was perhaps even more precious.If it really was only hematite, as long as the robbers weren't stupid, they would never choose to fight near Phoenix City. After all, even if they robbed so many hematite, it would be impossible to transport them away in a short period of time.However, although Tang Huan suspected it in his heart, he did not investigate further.If he knew too much about this kind of thing, it might attract other troubles. Since the Phoenix City was about to arrive, he would go his own way after entering the city.\"Boom \u2026\"The ground trembled even more violently. Not long later, a black mass of people appeared at the end of the road. At least a hundred people were riding fine horses and galloping like the wind.At the front was a burly man with a tanned face. However, he wore a white robe, making him look rather strange.\"Old Du, are you alright?\"The horse had yet to stop, but the white robed man had already leaped up from the saddle, instantly crossing over a dozen meters of empty space and landing in front of Du Xi, asking anxiously, \"Where's the thing, is it still there?\"Du Xi quickly replied: I'm fine, the thing is also here! Twelve Stage Five Martial Master s have come, six have died, and the remaining six have fled towards that direction! \"\"That's good!\"The white-robed man let out a sigh of relief, then let out a cold laugh. \"They won't be able to escape!\" As he spoke, he turned around and shouted at the hundreds of people who had just reined in their horses, \"Get down from the horses and search over there. Don't let a single one of them escape! See their corpses if they are alive!\"\"Yes sir!\"Amidst the deafening chorus, over a hundred people jumped to the ground at the same time and sped towards the direction indicated by the muscular man. In an instant, they disappeared without a trace.The white robed man turned around and smiled at Du Xi: \"Old Du, not bad, you actually killed off six Stage Five Martial Master s so quickly.\"\"The one who killed them wasn't me, but this little brother Ye Ze. The six of them were all killed by him.\" Du Xi laughed bitterly and pointed at Tang Huan.\"Oh?\"\"...\"After a long while, the caravan finally continued their journey. The shafts of each carriage were lit up by torches, illuminating the entire road.Tang Huan was still at the back of the convoy, and there were still people looking at him from time to time.But the difference from before was that now, those gazes were no longer guarded against any mockery. Instead, they were filled with a strong sense of curiosity and admiration. The white gowned man was also walking side by side with Tang Huan. He spoke and prattled around, trying to find out Tang Huan's identity.Before long, under the dim and gloomy night sky, a brightly lit town entered Tang Huan's line of sight.\"Phoenix City!\"The Phoenix City in front of him was not very big, and was probably only half of the size. The city was located in a valley, and behind the city, there was an incomparably huge mountain range crawling on the ground.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: 96The night was dark.Inside the biggest guest room in Phoenix City, Tang Huan sat cross legged, a ball of red flame lingered around his palm, the heat spread out, and the entire room became extremely hot.Enveloped in flames, he held a ball of emerald green liquid in his palm.This was the last mid-ranked gem that Tang Huan had on him, and before that, nine of the gems had already entered Xiao Budian's stomach.Not long after, Tang Huan poured the completed smelting gemstone into Xiao Budian's mouth.After over a hundred gems fell down, the sharp horn on Xiao Budian's head released a bright golden luster. However, compared to his peak state, it was still lacking.According to Tang Huan's estimations, another thirty to forty Intermediate Gems should be enough.However, Xiao Budian was actually still in deep sleep and he had not woken up yet, which made Tang Huan feel even more surprised. If it had not been for the fact that it had not appeared and even warned him this evening, he would have thought that the little fellow had contracted some kind of sickness.\"I have to think of a way to get some gems as soon as possible. Otherwise, this little guy will run out of food tomorrow.\"Looking at Xiao Budian who was sleeping soundly on the bed, Tang Huan couldn't help but to laugh, but right after, Tang Huan's brows slightly raised, and quickly hid Xiao Budian inside the cloth.\"Brother Ye Ze!\" Knock knock knock! The door was knocked on, and Du Xi's voice sounded out.\"Manager Lei, Manager Du, what business do you two have with me?\"Tang Huan stood up and opened the door to discover that it was not only Du Xi who had arrived. Even the sturdy man who was escorting the convoy was outside the door.After coming to the Phoenix City, Tang Huan found out that Du Xi was actually just a manager of the Star Ocean Commerce, while the man called Lei Ming was the manager of the Star Ocean Commerce. He managed all the shops in the Phoenix City that belonged to merchant guilds, and his position and strength were all higher than Du Xi.Just like this inn, it was one of the businesses in the Star Ocean Commerce.\"Brother Ye Ze, what are your plans for the future?\" Du Xi smiled as he entered the room, and directly went straight to the point.\"I plan to enter Feng Ming Mountain.\" Tang Huan did not conceal his intentions. Basically, the Martial Warriors s that came to the Phoenix City were all going to the Feng Ming Mountain to gain experience. If they wanted to head to the eastern region of the Origin Continent, there was no need to detour to the Phoenix City s if they had a closer path.\"Feng Ming Mountain is indeed a very suitable place to train.\"\"Du Xi smiled slightly, and exchanged a glance with Lei Ming, then suddenly changed the topic,\" Brother Ye Ze, I believe you have already guessed that the 'hematite' I sent to Phoenix City was just a cover, the real thing is actually something else.\"Oh?\"Tang Huan remained calm and collected.He was not interested in what Du Xi was really shipping for. What made him curious was, why would Du Xi say these words to him?\"That thing is called 'Dragon Crystal'!\" Du Xi suddenly said.\"Dragon Crystal?\"A strange look flashed across Tang Huan's eyes. [] [Table of Contents]If this were in the past, he would probably not have been moved by these three words. However, after reading the manual left behind by his master, he had left an extremely deep impression on this \"Dragon Crystal\". From the rank of a Dragon Crystal, it could be said to be a middle-ranked gem, but it was a type of mystical gem that could allow weapons to continuously advance to the next level.Of course, in order to have the mystical ability of continuously leveling up with weapons, there was another ingredient to go with, and that was \"Phoenix Flame Essence\".During the forging process, by fusing these two materials together, a dragon, phoenix, and a phoenix would be formed, causing the cultivator to undergo a complete transformation.A middle ranked weapon that had been infused with these two materials, if it were to continuously fuse with other materials, it could be gradually upgraded to a high ranked weapon, a Heavenly Grade Armament, and even a holy weapon that was extremely close to the Divine Armament.\"It looks like Brother Ye Ze knows about the 'Dragon Crystal' as well.\"Du Xi laughed, \"'Dragon Crystal' is too precious, we, the Star Ocean Commerce, do not want others to know that it was sent to the Phoenix City, but we have a lot of enemies in the Chamber of Commerce, the experts' every action will be noticed by others, being escorted by them, it is easy to notice their movements, so in the end, they sent a person who rarely shows up, they even used a large amount of 'hematite' as a cover, and also recruited a few guards in the Crescent City, all so as to hide it from others.\"\"But who would have thought that the enemy would find out, and even chose to act very close to the Phoenix City, when we are the most negligent. Luckily they were able to save the 'Dragon Crystal' with the help of Brother Ye Ze, and they didn't let those fellows succeed. Otherwise, I would be a criminal for the Chamber of Commerce. \"At the end, Du Xi sighed.\"Why is Manager Du telling me this?\" Tang Huan frowned, his heart becoming vigilant, Du Xi revealed such a secret, what scheme did he have?\"We would like to request Brother Ye Ze's help in seizing the 'Phoenix Flame Essence'.\" Du Xi said slowly as he looked at Tang Huan.\"Me?\"Hearing these words, Tang Huan couldn't help but be taken aback, and then immediately started laughing out loud while looking at Lei Ming and Du Xi, \"Manager Lei, Manager Du, I'm afraid you've found the wrong person, right? Your Star Ocean Commerce has many experts, countless of them, why would you need a small Stage Four Martial Master like me to help? \"\"Brother Ye Ze, don't be modest. If I'm not wrong, you are definitely the best at Stage Five Martial Master. If you weren't truly too young, no one would believe it even if you were said to be from the Stage Six Martial Master. \" Du Xi laughed. If it wasn't so, how could he have easily killed six Stage Five Martial Master s?\"You're wrong, I really am Stage Four Martial Master.\"Tang Huan laughed, and as he spoke, he had already opened his right palm. A small ball of flame emerged from the center of his palm with a \"pu\" sound, and started spinning quickly like a Spiritual Wheel, \"Do you see that?Seeing that, Lei Ming and Du Xi looked at each other, not knowing what to say.\"Brother Ye Ze, are you really Stage Four Martial Master?\"Du Xi said in disbelief, his face full of unconcealable shock. He thought that even though Tang Huan claimed that he was the Stage Four Martial Master, he was actually the Stage Six Martial Master. He never expected that he actually was the Stage Four Martial Master, and although the words might be fake, the Spiritual Wheel that was materialized from the power of the True Fire couldn't be fake.One Stage Four Martial Master, killing six Stage Five Martial Master s consecutively, this was just too scary.After clarifying the true strength of Tang Huan, the shock and astonishment in Du Xi's heart increased by countless of times. Lei Ming's eyes that were as round as bells opened wide and were filled with intense surprise.After a long while, Lei Ming then took a deep breath: \"Brother Ye Ze, if Old Du's description is correct, when you faced the enemy today, you ought to have used the 'Flaming Rainbow Spear Art'?\"\"That's right.\"Tang Huan looked at Du Ze in surprise. He never thought that he would still be able to notice his own battle skill when he was fighting against the two Stage Five Martial Master s.\"I wonder what kind of relationship Brother Ye Ze has with the 'Spear Saint' Ye Chongshan from a hundred years ago \u2026\" Lei Ming's voice became somewhat hurried.\"Uh, that's my great-grandfather.\"Tang Huan's heart was moved, and he smiled indifferently.Back then outside the Crescent City, he had only casually mentioned the name \"Ye Ze\". But now, he realized that this name seemed to be an extremely good cover up, not only was it surnamed Ye, it was also a practice of \"Flaming Rainbow Spear Art\". If he said that he and Ye Chongshan had nothing to do with each other, perhaps not many people would believe him.Descendant of the Spear Saint Ye Chongshan, this identity was not bad, and the chances of it being exposed was very slim.[] [Table of Contents] The unwritten children's paper can't be hurt, uh, friends who like this book don't forget to join the book circle and talk about me more. /(o )/~Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: 97\"As I thought. \"Go to my room and tell me. AiqUxs.Com.\"Whether it was Lei Ming or Du Xi, both of their faces revealed a look of relief.Lei Ming praised: \"A hundred years ago, Spear Saint could be said to be the Martial Saint of the Martial Saint, and Brother Ye Ze is the descendant of an elder. It's no wonder why he, who has just reached the realm of Stage Four Martial Master, actually possessed the powerful strength to sweep across the Stage Five Martial Master.Hearing that, Tang Huan could not help but be startled.He had used the True Fire to prove that he was only a Stage Four Martial Master and was just trying to push this matter aside. Unexpectedly, after impersonating as a descendant of Ye Chongshan, he became even more self-conscious.\"Brother Ye Ze, don't refuse first.\"Seeing Tang Huan's expression, Du Xi hurriedly said, \"That 'Phoenix Flame Essence' is actually located in the 'Phoenix Spirit Valley' of Feng Ming Mountain. This kind of treasure cannot be produced for more than three days, and its efficacy will be greatly reduced. Originally, our plan was to secretly transport the 'Dragon Crystal' over. After everything was ready, the Weapon Refiner would set off from Glory Continent and directly forge weapons beside the 'Phoenix Flame Essence', so that the opponent wouldn't have time to react. \"\"But we are not ready yet, and the Weapon Refiner of our merchant guild has not arrived yet, so the news has already been leaked, and has caught us off guard. At the latest tomorrow, the news regarding the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' will definitely spread throughout the entire Phoenix City, and will also spread throughout the entire Feng Ming Mountain. \"\"At that time, who knows how many people will still frantically search for 'Phoenix Flame Essence' within Feng Ming's mountain.\"\"Furthermore, this information was definitely leaked out from within our merchant guild, and the location of the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' will definitely be leaked out as well. I think that very soon, someone will find the Phoenix Spirit Valley and cause an intense fight, and some people will even intentionally destroy the 'Phoenix Flame Essence'.\"\"So, according to the original plan, it won't work. We can only think of another way that won't work.\" Since the news is bound to leak out, then, rather than waiting for others to spread it, it would be better for us to first leak out the information ourselves, and then we can also take the initiative to take the initiative. \"\"Turning passivity into initiative?\"Tang Huan asked with some doubt.Du Xi slightly nodded, and said with a heavy voice: \"According to our judgement, the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' should only have been formed around ten days later, reaching the state where it would be the most effective. Therefore, we will release information regarding the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' tonight and hold a 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting' meeting ten days later. \"\"Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting? \"What do you mean?\" Tang Huan was puzzled.\"In any case, after this information is leaked, the competition over the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' has become unavoidable. Before the Martial Competition begins, we will set up an registration office outside of the Phoenix Spirit Valley. All those who are interested in the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' can sign up for the martial competition. \"\"We of the Star Ocean Commerce will only keep 30% of those 'Phoenix Flame Essence', and the remaining 70% will be the rewards for the top three in the Martial Competition. The first place will get 40%, the second will get 20%, and the third will get 10%. Even if we do not enter the top three, as long as we enter the top hundred, the Martial Warriors s will still be able to obtain all kinds of prizes that are extremely valuable. When we spread the news, these prizes will all be made public. \"\"In addition, after Martial Competition ends, we will also create a set of 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Ranking', placing the names and origins of the top hundred Martial Warriors s onto the list, ranking them and then printing them out to spread throughout the world, which will definitely attract many Martial Warriors who covet the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' to participate in the Martial Competition.\"\"We hope that Brother Ye Ze can represent our Star Ocean Commerce in battle. If he can enter the top three ranks of the 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting', the reward for him being a 'Phoenix Flame Essence' will be seventy-three percent of our hope.\"\"However, we will definitely not let Brother Ye Ze suffer a loss. There will be a skilled Weapon Refiner who will use the portion of 'Phoenix Flame Essence' you obtained to forge a weapon. Furthermore, all the other materials such as the 'Dragon Crystal' that can be used to forge weapons will all be provided by us, the Star Ocean Commerce.\"As he finished speaking, an additional sense of anticipation emerged in the eyes Du Xi looked at Tang Huan.Seventy-three percent of the \"Phoenix Flame Essence\" awarded was, of course, the majority of the Star Ocean Commerce s.Although it looked like he was at a disadvantage, Star Ocean Commerce had promised to supply him with \"Dragon Crystal\" and all the other materials needed to forge a weapon, which could be considered as making up for his loss.One had to know, that \"Dragon Crystal\" was definitely one of the most expensive mid-grade gems, its value was not the slightest bit inferior to the Saint Grade Gem.It was just a colossus like the Star Ocean Commerce. Ordinary forces simply could not find the \"Dragon Crystal\" at all, and even the three great empire's imperial families did not necessarily have it.In an instant, Tang Huan's heart skipped a beat.But in an instant, Tang Huan's feverish mind calmed down again, and he laughed at himself: \"Manager Lei, Manager Du, you guys think too highly of me. Although my current strength can defeat ordinary Stage Five Martial Master, if I meet a powerful Stage Five Martial Master, or even a Stage Six Martial Master, I will lose without a doubt. \"\"Don't worry about this Brother Ye Ze.\"Lei Ming laughed, \"This' Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting 'isn't something that just anyone can participate in. When we hold our Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting s, we would also make a rule that all participants of the Martial Competition must not be stronger than the Stage Five Martial Master, thus, Brother Ye Ze, you have a very high chance of winning. \"Tang Huan was speechless when he heard this. \"Aren't the two of you afraid of arousing the displeasure of the Stage Six Martial Master?\"Lei Ming chuckled, \"Among Feng Ming Mountain and this Phoenix City, Stage Five Martial Master is the most numerous. Stage Six Martial Master is the least, so what can they do even if they are dissatisfied? They could not participate in the martial competition, as all the Stage Five Martial Master s were the happiest. If they dared to cause a ruckus, the many Stage Five Martial Master s would first reject them. This place is different from Glory Continent. The number of Stage Five Martial Master that have come here to gain experience is extremely few. \"\"I see.\"Tang Huan suddenly realized, \"Then what about your Star Ocean Commerce's opponent? If you hold the 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting', they will definitely come to cause trouble, right? \"Lei Ming laughed coldly: \"If we continue to hide it from them, we might really worry about whether they will come to cause trouble, but now that we have put this matter to the light, there is no need to care anymore. Our Star Ocean Commerce is able to stand tall for so many years without falling, it is not by our mouths.\"\"Since the rules have been set, whoever dares to jump out and break it, that person will be our Star Ocean Commerce's enemy. I actually hope that they can jump out now. That way, it'll be easier to catch up with them and catch them in one fell swoop. \"After a slight pause, Lei Ming looked at Tang Huan and said, \"Brother Ye Ze, a treasure like 'Phoenix Flame Essence' is something that is rarely seen in a hundred years, if you miss it then it will be gone.\"\"Manager Lei, I have another question. You have quite a few Stage Five Martial Master s near this Phoenix City, right? \" Tang Huan frowned slightly.\"There are indeed a lot of them, but none of them have any hope of entering the top three of Martial Competition. Thus, they have no choice but to ask Brother Ye Ze for help.\"Lei Ming said in a depressed tone, \"Sending people from the Glory Continent would take a long time, and what we need the most right now is to quickly slash through this mess. It is already slow enough to hold the 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting' ten days later, but unfortunately, the 'Phoenix Flame Essence' can only solidify after that long, otherwise, it would be able to advance the time quite a bit. \"\"Brother Ye Ze, regardless of whether or not this matter is successful, in the future, all of our Star Ocean Commerce's stores will give you a 20% discount when you buy something.\"\"That won't be necessary.\"A smile appeared on Tang Huan's face as he made his decision in his heart. \"Manager Lei, Manager Du, why don't you just trade this discount for a few dozen mid-ranked gems?\"\"No problem.\" When Lei Ming and Du Xi heard this, they immediately beamed with joy.\"...\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: 98\"...\"\"Have you heard? A 'Phoenix Flame Essence' has appeared in the Phoenix Spirit Valley of Feng Ming Mountain!\"\"Phoenix Flame Essence? But that sort of peerless treasure that could constantly raise the grade of a weapon? That thing is rarely seen in a hundred years, is what you said the truth or not? \"\"Fake? This is news released by the Star Ocean Commerce, how can it be fake? \"\"Star Ocean Commerce? Then it should not be wrong. \"\"...\"\"'Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting'? Star Ocean Commerce was really generous. Not only did he take out seventy percent of the Phoenix Flame Essence s, he even took out a large number of precious mid-grade and high-grade gems as a reward for the competition. \"\"Why did the Star Ocean Commerce do this? Isn't it good for them to monopolize all the 'Phoenix Flame Essence'? \"\"Yeah, if I found the 'Phoenix Flame Essence', I definitely wouldn't leak this information out.\"\"No matter what Star Ocean Commerce wants to do, the rewards that they brought out can't be fake. Otherwise, Star Ocean Commerce's reputation will be completely ruined.\"\"Right, right, let's go to Phoenix Spirit Valley to take a look first. I must definitely participate in this Martial Competition, so I don't dare to hope for entering the top three, but the top hundred, there's no problem at all! Hehe, how can the 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Ranking' not have my name on top of it? \"\"Damn it, this old man is Stage Six Martial Master, why can't Stage Six Martial Master participate?\"\"...\"Early in the morning the next day, as Tang Huan was walking within the Phoenix City, all he could hear were the words \"Phoenix Flame Essence\", \"Phoenix Spirit Valley\", \"Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting\", and \"Phoenix Spirit Martial Ranking\".Almost at the same time, within Tang Huan's line of sight, there were many Martial Warriors who called out and left the city.After a night had passed, the news regarding \"Phoenix Flame Essence\" had spread throughout the entire Phoenix City.The reason Tang Huan left the Phoenix City was naturally to enter Feng Ming Mountain as well.When the sky had just started to brighten, Du Xi personally delivered the middle ranked gems to them.Although they could not compare to the middle ranked gems that Shan Shan had gifted him in the Furious Waves City, in terms of the overall quality, there were still a total of one hundred and twenty of them. When they were all filled, the empty wooden box was once again filled to the brim.With these middle ranked gems, Xiao Budian did not need to worry about his rations for the time being.Tang Huan walked as fast as he could, he had already taken off his mask before he left the door, and a smile was on his face that had recovered its original appearance, as he quickly left Phoenix City.Outside the city, there were more Martial Warriors on the way. It had to be said that Lei Ming and Du Xi's move was extremely clever.First, there were seventy percent of the \"Phoenix Flame Essence\" and many precious gems as bait, and then there was the \"Phoenix Spirit Martial Ranking\" that could spread throughout the world. With both of them in sync, they immediately gathered all of the Stage Five Martial Master and the majority of the Stage Five Martial Master within Feng Ming Mountain.This time's \"Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting\", no matter what the result was, Star Ocean Commerce was still the biggest winner.Of course, if the news was not leaked out, the \"Star Ocean Commerce\" would not suffer any loss, but if the news was leaked out, the \"Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting\" would turn the bad news into a good thing, bringing the competition for the \"Phoenix Flame Essence\" into an orderly fight, continuously reducing the risk of the \"Phoenix Flame Essence\" getting destroyed, and also gaining a huge reputation. Right now, the Star Ocean Commerce was basically in an invincible position.Moreover, the Star Ocean Commerce secretly invited people to battle. If they could take first place, then they could take a step forward.However, Tang Huan was also well aware that he was definitely not the only Martial Warriors that Star Ocean Commerce was looking for. Lei Ming and Du Xi would definitely not put all their eggs in the same basket.Tang Huan did not care about this at all. His main purpose for coming to Feng Ming Mountain was not \"Phoenix Flame Essence\", but \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\" and the \"Divine Weapon Catalogue\" remnant on \"Flamewing Phoenix King's body.\"If he could take over the top three in Martial Competition, acquire a portion of the \"Phoenix Flame Essence\", and forge a weapon that could continuously advance, that would naturally be an unexpected surprise.If they couldn't get it, then there wouldn't be any loss.\u2026 \u2026.\"Hateful!\" You are one step behind Star Ocean Commerce! \"Inside an exquisite hut on the west side of Phoenix City, a middle-aged man who was sitting cross-legged on the ground turned ashen, his palm slammed down fiercely, causing the stone ground to crack like spider webs. \"That Lei Ming looks huge and thick, I never thought he was so crafty.\"\"Yeah, I didn't expect them to react so quickly.\"On the other side of the middle-aged man, a red-clothed female could not help but laugh bitterly, \"If we release the news, it would very quickly trigger a competition for the 'Phoenix Flame Essence'. Once everyone kills until their eyes turn red, it would be impossible to stop. Right now, the Phoenix City and the Martial Warriors of Feng Ming Mountain are probably all rushing towards the Martial Competition.The woman who spoke was around twenty-four to twenty-five years old. Not only did she have a charming face, her figure was also extremely slim. Although she was also sitting on a praying mat, her curvaceous body was still outlined by her tight dress.After pausing for a moment, the woman in red raised her head and asked, \"Zhong Kang, out of the twelve people from yesterday, how many have returned?\"\"Not a single one. They must have all been killed!\"The middle-aged man called Zhong Kang was exceptionally angry, \"I had originally wanted to make use of this opportunity to drive Star Ocean Commerce out of Origin Continent, but who would have thought that this would be the result.\"\"Not only is this a waste of time, the chess pieces that we have set up in the Star Ocean Commerce for so many years might even be taken care of in one fell swoop. It's all because of that group of trash. The twelve Stage Five Martial Master s actually could not handle the convoy of two Stage Five Martial Master s.The woman in red muttered to herself, \"There must be something fishy about this. Didn't we arrange for some people to enter the caravan? Why don't you ask him to come over and see what's going on?\"\"So what if I ask? The plan has failed! \" Zhong Kang's expression was extremely gloomy.\"Although the plan has failed, we cannot let the Star Ocean Commerce have it so easy.\" The red-clothed girl squinted her eyes as she slowly spoke.\"Mu Yan, you mean to say \u2026\" Zhong Kang was slightly surprised.\"Isn't Lei Ming going to hold the 'Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting'? How could I ignore such an enviable reward? If I accidentally get first place in Martial Competition, that would be too interesting. \" After saying that, Mu Yan laughed, and the flowers on her body started to shake, her breasts rising and falling, looking extremely alluring.\"Fine, fine, let's do it, anyway, this' Phoenix Spirit Martial Meeting 'is limited to cultivation, and not to age!\"Zhong Kang's complexion immediately changed from gloomy to clear, he laughed, but when he spoke, he could not help but lick his lips, a greedy look flashing across his eyes as he looked at Mu Yan's chest. But when Mu Yan's gaze swept over him, the greed in his eyes immediately disappeared and was replaced with a deep dread.Amongst all the Stage Five Martial Master in the world, there really might not be anyone who could defeat this woman!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: 99\"The 'Nirvana Sacred Fire' is in Phoenix Spirit Valley?\"Five days later, in the evening, within the mountain forest, Tang Huan was in a daze as he looked at the two maps in his hands. [] [Table of Contents]Of the two maps, one was the Spiritual Fire that Gu Yi had given him after the conclusion of the [Weapon Refining Competition] and the other was the Phoenix Spirit Valley that Du Xi had given him five days ago.Previously in the inn, Tang Huan had not compared the two.After arriving near the Phoenix Spirit Valley, on a whim, he took out the two maps, only to find that the location of the \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\" and the Phoenix Spirit Valley's location had coincided.\"This is heaven's will!\"Tang Huan muttered, but then he frowned.In the Phoenix Spirit Valley region, a large number of Martial Warriors had already appeared. In the next few days, the number of Martial Warriors that had gathered here would definitely increase greatly. The \"Nirvana Sacred Fire\" had intelligence. If it was scared and ran somewhere else, it would be very difficult to find it.As such a thought flashed through Tang Huan's mind, he couldn't help but feel somewhat anxious.After placing the map back in his bosom, Tang Huan was about to run forward, but just as he took two steps, he stopped and looked towards his left front in the blink of an eye.A moment later, a figure staggered out from the forest.It was a sixteen to seventeen year old girl, holding a light red sword in her hand. She was wearing a tight black robe, which made her look quite graceful. However, her hair was messy at the moment, and her face and clothes were dirty.[] [Table of Contents]As the girl in black ran forward, she looked back, as if she was being chased by something. Her jade-like face was filled with panic.\"It's her?\"Tang Huan finally saw her face clearly, and a look of surprise flashed past his eyes.This girl was actually Gu Fei, the Gu Fei he had met once before in the Divine Weapon Pavilion. It was just that she was wearing a black dress now, and at that time was a red dress. That day when he left the Divine Weapon Pavilion and returned to the blacksmith shop, he finally came to his senses. Gu Fei should be the daughter of the Gu Family.If she didn't stay in the Furious Waves City, what was she doing in such a dangerous place?Just as Tang Huan was feeling suspicious, Gu Fei had also noticed Tang Huan. His face revealed an expression of excitement and joy that was hard to conceal, and he opened his mouth, about to call out Tang Huan's name. But soon after, she seemed to have thought of something and pursed her red lips. She shifted her direction and ran to the side.Her strange actions caused Tang Huan to be stunned.Not long later, Tang Huan understood what was going on. A white figure had actually appeared at the place Gu Fei just appeared from. It was a young man in his twenties. He was wearing snow-white clothes, had a slender body, a delicate and pretty face, and his skin was as fair as a woman's. He was carrying a long rod on his shoulder.The staff was about two meters long. It was carved with wave-like patterns and emitted a faint blue light.The young man's strength was obviously above Gu Fei's, and he looked as though he was strolling leisurely, with a slow pace, but his speed wasn't slow at all. From the start, he maintained a distance of around twenty meters away from Gu Fei.With regards to Tang Huan, who was not far away from him, the young man turned a blind eye to him and only played around with the young girl who was running away in panic like a little cat.Seeing that, Tang Huan's heart was filled with anger.Killing people was simply impossible. This guy could have easily intercepted and captured Gu Fei, but he deliberately chased after him and played tricks on him. This was truly hateful!\"Whoosh!\"In the blink of an eye, Tang Huan leaped forward, and in an instant, he passed through over ten meters of space, and landed in front of the young man.Gu Fei turned her head and saw this scene, she was shocked and immediately stopped in her tracks. Turning around, she opened her mouth to shout, but just as the voice was about to burst out, she heard Tang Huan's voice: \"I am Ye Ze, isn't it a bit too much to be teasing a little girl like friends?\"\"Ye Ze?\"Gu Fei was stunned, wasn't he Tang Huan? Why did he change his name?However, after being stunned for only a short while, she came to a realization that Tang Huan obviously did not want to reveal his true identity, and thus changed his name, \"Ye Ze, quickly go. This guy is Martial Master who has already reached the peak of the fifth step, you \u2026 You are not his match! \"The reason why she didn't call Tang Huan earlier was because she didn't want to implicate him. She didn't expect him to still interfere.Gu Fei anxiously stomped her feet and shouted, but Tang Huan turned a deaf ear to her. She stood still like a javelin, and looked at the young man with squinted eyes.He did this not only because he knew Gu Fei, but also because this girl had helped him.In the past, when the owner of this body was only around ten years old, he had been beaten up black and blue by the Tang Family several times. That day, after returning from the Divine Weapon Pavilion, Tang Huan remembered Gu Fei's identity and remembered all of these things.\"A hero saving a beauty?\" As if he had just discovered Tang Huan, the young man squinted his eyes as the corner of his mouth revealed a trace of ridicule, \"Brat, a hero saving a beauty is not something that anyone can do. Many a times, if a beauty is not saved, the hero would turn into a bear and it would even be a dead bear.\"\"You're wrong, this isn't called saving a beauty by a hero, it's called punishing evil to eliminate evil.\" Tang Huan sneered.\"Punishment to exterminate evil?\"The young man obviously did not think that Tang Huan would reply in such a manner, and could not help but be startled, and then immediately burst out laughing, with a faintly discernible look of disdain and ridicule in his eyes, \"Brat, your tone is not bad, but, wanting to get rid of this evil person is not an easy matter.\"\"How would we know without trying?\"Tang Huan's nose snorted, and with a \"weng\" sound, the Crimson Flame Spear fell into his palm. Following the slight swing of the spear's head, the black cloth wrapped around the spear started to fall off, and the resplendent red glow gradually exploded outwards. At the same time, a scorching heat permeated the air.\"It seems that I, an evil person, have to do some evil things.\"The young man's right arm sank as the staff on his shoulder suddenly bounced up, slanted his finger, and laughed out loud at Tang Huan: \"Brat, don't blame me if you die!\"In the next moment, a dazzling dark blue luster blossomed from the lance in her hand. At the location of the fist-sized lance, it was as if there was a layer of jade wave surging. The violent aura was like a raging wave, wave after wave, it surged and swept towards Tang Huan.Seeing that, Tang Huan's face became more serious, between the mind instructs (in a second), he had activated True Fire, causing an even more powerful heat to sweep out from the location of the spear.\"Wait! \"Hold on!\"Just then, Gu Fei ran back with a shout. Her face was slightly pale, and she spoke anxiously: \"Ye Ze, this person had already been a Stage Five Martial Master for many years, but kept suppressing his cultivation, so he did not condense the third stage of Spiritual Wheel, and was promoted to a Stage Six Martial Master. Furthermore, he cultivates the world-famous' Flowing Wave Staff Tactic ', you were previously still a Martial Disciple, how can you be his opponent now?\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: 100\"Gu Fei, you \u2026\"Seeing her spouting out so much in a single breath, Tang Huan was at a loss whether to laugh or to cry. Inwardly, he felt deeply moved, this little girl was indeed kindhearted, when she saw him just now, not only did she not greet him, she had even changed the direction, not wanting to get himself involved.\"Ye Ze, don't say anymore.\"Without waiting for Tang Huan to finish speaking, Gu Fei interrupted him and looked towards the young man. She took out a small package from her bosom, \"Tang Long, I don't want this item. As for the matter between us, I do not wish to implicate others. As for me, if you want to kill me, kill me. \"\"Let him go?\"\"Gu Fei, you're really childish. It's obvious that you're acquainted with him, but if I kill you and then release him, wouldn't it be obvious that I told the Gu family that I killed you?\"\"I am an evil person, so I naturally have to be worthy of the words' evil and wicked person '. You, I want to kill. As for the item in your hand, regardless of whether you give it to me or not, it will still be mine in the end. \"As he said these words, a thick smile hung on Tang Long's face, but deep within his eyes, a killing intent that caused one's heart to palpitate flashed.\"You \u2026\"Gu Fei's delicate body trembled in anger, her beautiful face flushed red, and she instantly gritted her teeth. Her graceful body stood in front of Tang Huan, \"Ye Ze, hurry up and leave! I'll stop him for a while. Whether or not you can escape this time will depend on your luck.\"Tsk tsk, what a lecherous concubine.\"Tang Long sized up the two of them, and said while beaming, \"However, it's better if you two stop wasting your time, neither of you will be able to escape.\"Rest assured, I will bury you all together. Being able to be a pair of lovebirds after death can be considered a good ending. You must thank me for that.\"\"Ye Ze, don't listen to his nonsense, you \u2026\"Gu Fei was both angry and embarrassed, and her face was as red as fire, as if she was drunk.But, before she could finish her sentence, Tang Huan suddenly took a few steps forward and stood in front of her, as if he did not have any plans to escape.\"Your name is Tang Long?\"Staring intently at Tang Long, Tang Huan suddenly spoke up, his expression becoming extremely gloomy. Both of his slightly narrowed eyes seemed to have solidified and actually revealed a sharp glint, like a unsheathed sword, \"The son of the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City's Tang Family Patriarch?\"Gu Fei's expression suddenly changed. She knew that things were bad the moment she heard this.This Tang Long was the son of the Tang Family's Patriarch, Tang Tianren, and Mei Xin, the son of Tang Tianren, the illegitimate son. The two of them could be considered brothers beyond their parents.However, this pair of brothers were probably no different from enemies.With her understanding of Tang Huan, knowing his identity was fine, but now that she knew, even if he died, he wouldn't run away.\"Right, am I already so famous?\"Tang Long laughed in ridicule, but he was a little surprised in his heart. The black-robed youth opposite him had a very strange expression in his eyes, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what was so strange about it.However, Tang Long did not take it to heart.What the young man was thinking at the moment, was not important at all, because before long, he would turn into a pile of yellow soil on top of Feng Ming's mountain.There was no need to investigate the thoughts of someone who was destined to die.\"As expected of Tang Tianren's seed, he's simply a small marten on the same mountain as him.\"Tang Huan raised his eyebrows and could not help but sneer.He had lived in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City for more than ten years and had seen many Tang Clan Disciples s. For example, Tang Chao, Tang Hong, Tang Jiang, and Tang Junjie, he had never heard of Tang Long before.Tang Long was the most talented genius in the Nu Lang (Furious Waves) City's Tang Family's younger generation.It was said that Tang Long had been sent to the Heavenly Forging City since a very young age, to be under the tutelage of an extremely powerful Martial Warriors.According to what Tang Huan knew, Tang Long should only be twenty-one or twenty-two years old this year.To be able to become a peak-Fifth Order Martial Master at such an age, and one that could advance to the Sixth Order at any time, it was indeed worthy of his name as a genius.Tang Huan had never thought that he would actually meet Yue Yang under such circumstances.When he was young, Tang Huan held incomparable hatred towards this half-brother of his.But as he grew older, the hatred in his heart gradually lessened, but to say that Tang Huan had any sort of brotherly feelings towards him, it was all nonsense.In Tang Huan's heart, Tang Long was no different from a stranger. It was already good enough that he did not go and cause trouble for him. If she met him somewhere else, it would also be like running into a stranger, but like now, if he wanted to make a move on her, Tang Huan would not be merciful.Although Tang Huan did not reveal his identity, Tang Huan did not think that revealing his identity would cause Tang Long to lose his killing intent.\"Since you two are done with your nonsense, it's about time for you two to leave.\" Tang Long laughed, and his wrist suddenly sank down.\"Buzz!\"An intense sound rang out, and the long rod seemed to have become extremely soft as it swung out like a ripple, producing waves of sound. At the same time, a tyrannical aura swept out like a wave, as if it wanted to smash any obstacle in front of it into smithereens.Gu Fei's beautiful face went pale as she uncontrollably retreated two steps back.However, Tang Huan did not retreat, but advanced instead. The Scarlet Flame Spear in his hand shone brilliantly, the heat wave churned violently and the surrounding temperature sharply rose, as if Tang Huan was not holding a weapon forged by a iron ore, but a bunch of long flames.The spear and rod faced each other in an imposing manner, ready to strike at any moment.\"The son of the Tang family is really powerful.\"However, at this time, ridiculing laughter resounded in the forest almost without warning. This sound was rather strange. It was hoarse and sharp, as if it could pierce through a person's eardrums. At this moment, not only Gu Fei, even the opposing Tang Huan and Tang Long's gazes were attracted.After an instant, a black figure flashed into Tang Huan's line of sight.Even with Tang Huan's eyesight, he was still unable to see how the black shadow had appeared. Surprised, Tang Huan couldn't help but size him up carefully. It was also a young man who was around twenty years old, with a short and thin body.The short man's hands were empty, and he did not carry any weapons. He walked over shakily with a mocking smile on his face.\"Tang Si!\"Looking at this person, Tang Long's expression changed slightly as he snorted coldly, \"I never thought that you, a traitor, would actually hide within Feng Ming Mountain. That fellow from the clan is a complete piece of trash; However, you sure have a lot of guts to actually show up in front of me! \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
