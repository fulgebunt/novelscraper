Azure light flashed from his body, and there was no trace of water left in the pond.At that moment, he discovered that the Heavenraiser Bottle and the Fused Five Extreme Mountains were all safe and sound in his body. In contrast, Magic Light and the others were completely still in the spirit beast pouch.This place appeared to be an extremely simple platform. Aside from the pond at the center, the platform was enshrouded in a layer of azure light.Outside the light screen, one could vaguely see large snowflakes dancing in the sky. Outside was actually a sparkling and translucent world of ice and snow.\"So it's Friend Han.If it's the Spirit Realm, then that's going to be a bit of a headache.Two or three out of ten of the lower realms have this name.So be it, I'll just register it for you.In any case, the higher-ups generally won't investigate this kind of thing. \"Gao Sheng frowned, but then quickly put on a nonchalant expression.He then made a grabbing motion with his hands, and a translucent jade book and a huge silver brush appeared in his hands. He then quickly wrote something on them.Although Han Li was slightly surprised, he didn't reveal it on his face. Instead, he stood on the spot and silently observed Han Li's actions.Moments later, light flashed from Gao Sheng's hands, and the jade book and brush disappeared at the same time. In their place, a thin purple jade badge appeared, and he handed it to Han Li with a smile.\"This is?\" Han Li didn't immediately take it. Instead, he calmly asked.\"This is Fellow Daoist's immortal badge. It's something that all ascended immortals can receive after registering themselves.Fellow Daoist, you can rely on this to enter the various immortal cities in the future without being inspected. Moreover, you can enter some special places without paying any fees.Hehe, this is only for you ascended immortals. True immortals from the True Immortal Realm like us don't have such treatment, \"Gao Sheng said in an envious voice.\"Oh, why is that?\" Han Li finally revealed a trace of surprise.\"The Realm of True Immortals is boundless, and there are trillions of native Immortals. However, there are very few Immortals who ascend from the Lower Realms with their own strength.However, among the high-ranking immortals in each immortal domain, the number of ascended immortals and native immortals was about the same.Fellow Daoist should be very clear about what this means, right? \"Gao Sheng explained with a smile.\"So that's how it is. I somewhat understand now.Since the Immortal World has such a rule, then I won't stand on ceremony. \"Han Li came to a sudden realization, and he nodded before raising a hand to accept the purplish-golden jade badge. He looked down at it to find that there was a life-like image of his entire body inscribed on it, and there were also his name and a few golden seal characters beside it, such as \"Ascension\".Han Li swept a sleeve through the air, and the jade badge instantly vanished in a flash.He asked with a smile, \"From Brother Gao's tone, the Immortal World seems to be quite orderly, but I don't know what Fellow Daoist is referring to \u2026\"\"Brother Han doesn't need to ask about this matter. As long as you read the things recorded in this memory stone, you will have a rough understanding.\" Gao Sheng didn't say anything more. He raised his hand and threw a blue crystal stone to Han Li.\"Then I thank you very much.\"Han Li caught the crystal stone with a trace of gratitude on his face. He put it on his forehead and understood how to use it. After a little incantation, he immersed his Divine Sense into it.After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, Han Li took a deep breath and removed the crystal from his forehead, then slowly said, \"You're right.He said slowly, \"I see. The Immortal World is now divided into countless immortal domains, and these immortal domains are supervised by various immortal palaces.This is a bit interesting. Only supervision but not rule? \"\"Fellow Daoist is really an understanding person.In this case, I will explain the current situation of the Immortal World to Fellow Daoist.I don't know if Fellow Daoist is interested in listening! \"Gao Sheng asked with a strange expression on his face when he heard Han Li's words.\"Brother Gao, please give me some pointers.\" Han Li cupped his hands, and his face was a little dignified.\"Friend Han, you don't have to be polite.The situation of the Immortal World is indeed quite different from the Immortal World.Although the immortal domains are nominally ruled by the immortal palaces, in fact, there are many great forces in each immortal domain that are not under the immortal palaces. There are even some super forces that can firmly suppress the immortal palaces in their own immortal domains.It's just that the Tao Ancestors need to maintain a certain order in the Immortal World to avoid some big trouble that is hard to clean up. That's why they tacitly agree that the immortal palaces are nominally the masters of each immortal domain.Of course, these immortal palaces themselves are also a few great forces in the immortal domain. Otherwise, they won't be able to convince the masses.Most of these immortal palaces are also very tactful. Generally, they won't anger other great forces that are comparable to them, so the current Immortal World is still peaceful.As long as they don't violate certain laws of the Immortal World, they can naturally live freely in the Immortal World.But Fellow Daoist is an ascended Immortal, so the situation is slightly different from the local Immortals.Even though you have just ascended to become a True Immortal, and the True Essence in your body has already begun to change and can accept Immortal Spiritual Power, I'm afraid it will still take hundreds of years to completely transform it.If I were you, I would definitely choose to rely on one of the forces in the immortal domain. After the True Essence in my body is completely transformed, I will only consider other things.Otherwise, since Fellow Daoist has just arrived in the Immortal World, I'm afraid the daily consumption of Immortal Spiritual Crystals is not a small amount. \"Gao Sheng no longer stood on ceremony and spoke frankly with assurance.As Han Li listened, he revealed a thoughtful look.\"Thank you Brother Gao for your guidance. From your tone, you don't seem to be from the immortal palace, right?\" Han Li smiled and suddenly asked.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Immortal Cultivation Method?\" Han Li narrowed his eyes and asked.\"Immortal Cultivation Method is a cultivation method specially for Immortals and above to cultivate. Only by cultivating such a cultivation method can one truly refine Immortal Spiritual Power, allowing low-level Immortals to advance step by step to the high-level Immortal Realm.However, most low-level and mid-level Immortal Cultivation Methods can only allow people to advance by one or two realms, and then they will have to choose another cultivation method to cultivate again.Only those high-level Immortal Cultivation Methods that are collected by the major forces have the ability to allow Perfected Immortals to directly cultivate to an extremely high realm.Immortal books of this level were rarely circulated in the outside world.Even if there are some, they are just some common goods. \"Gao Sheng seemed to have seen through Han Li's doubts, so he took the initiative to explain.\"Oh, is there no Immortal Cultivation Method that can directly lead to the Dao Ancestor Realm?\" Han Li asked slowly.\"Dao Ancestor?Haha, Friend Han's ambition is really not something that ordinary people can imagine.But unfortunately, even the few legendary Divine Scriptures in the Immortal World can't let people directly cultivate to the Dao Ancestor Realm.Currently, there were hundreds of Dao Ancestors in the Immortal World. Every single one of them had experienced countless tribulations and endured an unimaginable amount of good fortune in order to reach their current realm.Even the most profound and unfathomable Immortal Cultivation Method can only allow one to cultivate to the Zenith Heaven Realm below the Dao Ancestor Realm. If you want to go any higher, you can only rely on yourself. \"Gao Sheng revealed a strange expression, but after laughing, he still explained.\"It seems that becoming a Dao Ancestor is something that can only be hoped for!But I don't know how many levels of Immortal Realm there are below the Dao Ancestor Realm. \"Han Li did not reveal a surprised expression, but nodded and asked again.\"Although we are called Perfected Immortals by the people of the lower realm, the Perfected Immortal Realm is actually only a low-level existence among Immortals. There are still a few levels above it, such as Golden Immortal, Primordial Unity, and Zenith Heaven Realm.The cultivation of each level often requires more than a million years of hard work, so there will be a few subdivisions among them.Even among people of the same cultivation realm, if there is a difference in cultivation rank, the difference in their abilities will be like the difference between heaven and earth, \"Gao Sheng replied without hesitation.\"What realm is Brother Gao in now?\" Han Li asked thoughtfully.\"I'm very ashamed. I've been a True Immortal for millions of years, but I've always been stuck at the True Immortal level, unable to advance any further.If there are no other opportunities, I can only spend the rest of my life in this realm. \"Gao Sheng smiled bitterly.Upon hearing this, Han Li's expression changed slightly.He could not see through the other party's strength at all, and it was actually only at the True Immortal Realm.\"In other words, a newly ascended immortal like me should only be at the low-level True Immortal stage,\" Han Li murmured.\"Low position?It could barely be considered as such!After all, Friend Han's Immortal Origin Energy has yet to be completely converted, so he can only be considered a false Immortal. He'll have to wait several hundred years before he can truly become a low-level True Immortal, \"Gao Sheng replied with a smile.When Han Li heard this, he was left speechless. After a long while, he asked again,\"Judging by Gao Sheng's tone, in addition to us True Immortals, there are also quite a number of ordinary cultivators in the Immortal Plane.\"\"There are indeed cultivators below the level of True Immortal in the Immortal Realm.Even though we Immortals are powerful, we can't guarantee that our descendants will also be able to cultivate to the Immortal Realm. Because these people can't absorb Immortal spiritual energy, their lifespan is limited. They can only marry and have children, which will give birth to more mortals.With this continuous cycle, the number of people can be imagined. \"Gao Sheng seemed to be disapproving of these mortals.\u201c\"I see!It seems that a high-grade Immortal cultivation method is indeed very important to us True Immortals. \"Han Li nodded and began to ponder.\"Our Stone Axis Palace values Immortals who have ascended to the Immortal Plane very much, so other powers won't offer much better conditions than this.Furthermore, Fellow Daoist can first serve as an outer disciple of our Stone Axis Palace. If after several hundred years, you really feel that our Stone Axis Palace is not suitable for Fellow Daoist, you can leave on your own as long as you take out something equivalent to the Immortal cultivation method you have chosen. We won't stop you in the slightest. \"Gao Sheng seemed to have seen through the last trace of hesitation in Han Li's heart.There's such a condition?Alright, since Brother Gao says so, then Han will go to your Stone Axis Palace to see for himself. Han Li's eyes flashed, and he finally made a decision.Just as Gao Sheng had said, the most important thing for him now was to convert the Immortal Origin Energy in his body and truly consolidate his True Immortal Realm.Under such circumstances, it was not a bad choice for him to first attach himself to a major power and then slowly understand the entire Immortal Realm.When Gao Sheng heard Han Li's reply, he was naturally overjoyed and repeatedly said that Han Li would not regret his decision. With a shake of his sleeve, a shadow separated from his back and condensed into a silver-robed \"Gao Sheng.\"\"You will be on duty here for a period of time. I will first take Friend Han to the Stone Axis Palace.\"The silver-robed Gao Sheng replied expressionlessly, \"Then you will have to return quickly. If you are discovered by the supervisor of this region, I won't be able to cover for you for long.\"\"You don't need to worry about that.This Immortal Ascension Platform is located in such a remote place. How could a supervisor easily come here? The last time a supervisor appeared here was several hundred years ago.Besides, I am only here to escort someone. I will return in a few days at most, \"Gao Sheng said nonchalantly.\"As long as you know your limits. Don't implicate me when the time comes.\"The silver-robed Gao Sheng said no more. He walked to the side of the pool and sat down cross-legged. He then closed his eyes and entered a meditative state.When Han Li saw this, a trace of surprise appeared on his face.\"I've let Brother Han see a joke. This is a Dirt Incarnation that I have cultivated. Although it is not as strong as me, it is more than enough to deal with a low-level True Immortal.With it on duty, I can leave with peace of mind.Come, I will take you to the Stone Axis Palace. \"Gao Sheng explained with a smile as he formed an incantation gesture with one hand and pointed at the light screen outside the platform.\"Poof!\"The light screen opened, revealing a circular passageway that was as tall as a person.Gao Sheng walked out with large strides and Han Li followed closely behind him.As soon as they left the platform, snow began to fall from the sky. At the same time, a strange chill swept toward them.Even with Han Li's tyrannical body, he could not help but frown.When Gao Sheng saw Han Li's situation, a trace of surprise flashed across his face.Since the Northern Frost Immortal Realm was named after the word \"Han\", the temperature outside was usually extremely cold. If they encountered such a snowy day, the power of the strange chill in the air could be imagined.Even low-level Immortals who were born and raised in this Immortal Realm had to wear one or two specially refined anti-cold artifacts before they dared to face the snow directly.But Han Li, an Immortal who had just ascended, was unexpectedly able to ignore the snow without batting an eyelid. How could this not make Gao Sheng secretly shocked?Gao Sheng's thoughts turned quickly, but his hands did not stop moving.He suddenly shot a white incantation gesture downward, and several clear sounds came from the thick layer of snow below.In the midst of the dancing snowflakes, two huge white peacocks rushed out of the snow.\"Fellow Immortal, please!\"After Gao Sheng lifted his foot and mounted one of the snow peacocks, he pointed at the other and said to Han Li with a smile.A faint smile appeared on Han Li's face as his body swayed, and he also appeared on the other peacock.After Gao Sheng shouted in a low voice, the two immortal birds immediately spread their wings and soared into the sky toward the sparkling snowflakes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sky was filled with yellow dust, swirling in the air.A thin and petite figure gradually became clear in the yellow sky. She was running forward with all her might.This was a girl around six or seven years old. Her light yellow dress was embroidered with light pink plum blossoms. Her jet-black hair was coiled into two buns, and she had a pair of intelligent big black eyes. Below her exquisite nose was a bright red, making her entire face look delicate and beautiful.The girl's right hand was tightly holding a palm-sized rattle drum.This rattle drum should have been around for a long time. The sides of the drum were a little yellow. There were several green snake patterns on it. The two pellets connected to the ears were flipping up and down. They fell on the drum from time to time, making a few light sounds.The girl was young, but her body was quite agile. After a few leaps, she appeared in an open space in front of the weeds that were as tall as a person.Perhaps it was because she was running too fast. Her snow-white forehead was covered with beads of sweat. A stream of sweat flowed down from her left cheek and flowed into her white neck.She stretched out her left hand to wipe it. Her tight round face was red like a ripe apple. However, she didn't stop running.\"Evildoer, where do you think you're going?!\"At this moment, a man's shout came from afar.The girl's body trembled when she heard this. She was so scared that her face turned pale. She raised her right hand that was holding the rattle drum and turned it with all her might. Her lips moved a few times.A layer of faint green light suddenly appeared on the surface of the drum. As the pellets fell on the drum, a light sound was heard. A green light flew out from the drum and fell on a cluster of weeds in front of her.A layer of green light suddenly appeared on the surface of the weeds. However, the green light only flashed for a moment. It seemed that nothing had happened.The girl's right hand turned a few times. A green light flew out from both sides of the rattle drum along with the two pellets. They fell on the surrounding weeds and gave rise to waves of green light.After doing all this, the girl's face became a bit pale. However, she didn't have time to rest. She hurriedly drilled into the weeds in front of her.Not long after the little girl's figure disappeared into the weeds, a cloud of dust rose more than a hundred feet behind her. A figure rushed over and appeared in front of the weeds.The owner of the figure was a burly man with a curly beard in his forties. He was tall and carried a shining podao in one hand. He looked quite fierce and fiendish.His gaze fell on the small footprints left in the grass in front of him. He moved his body and was about to rush in with his saber.Right at this moment, azure light flashed from the underbrush up ahead, and five or six long azure snakes shot forth before pouncing viciously toward the burly man.The curly-bearded man was startled at first. Then, he quickly fished out a talisman with his left hand and slapped it on his body. A layer of white light barrier emerged. At the same time, his right arm trembled, and the podao in his hand emitted a loud buzzing sound as it slashed forward.Chi la!A cold light that was a few feet long shot out from the podao. As the azure light flashed, three of the azure snakes were slashed in half. Then, with two \"peng peng\" sounds, the remaining two azure snakes were also bounced away by the white light barrier on the burly man's body. They were also slashed in half by the burly man's saber light.These azure snakes were defeated by the burly man with a curly beard in one move. They then revealed their true form, which was actually a few clusters of green weeds.The burly man with a curly beard snorted. As he was about to continue rushing into the grass, his expression suddenly changed. He put away the podao and stood still.A rustling sound came from behind, and two figures came together.One of them was a tall and thin Young Taoist priest. He wore a gray robe that looked a bit tattered. He was holding a white horsetail whisk in his hand. The other person was a short and vigorous horse-faced man. There were a few bruises on his face, and his hair looked messy.\"Are the two of you alright?\" The burly man with a curly beard looked back at the two and asked.\"This evildoer is indeed the daughter of the Bewitching Fox. She is really cunning. Just now, Taoist Qi and I were a bit anxious and accidentally fell into her trap. It's nothing serious.However, why did Friend Yan stop here? Where is that evildoer now? \"The horse-faced man waved his hand and asked with some doubts.The burly man with a curly beard did not speak. He pointed at the tall weeds in front of him. The delicate footprints in the weeds were still clearly visible.\"Then what are we waiting for?Let's catch him in one go. \"Seeing this, the horse-faced man was about to rush into the weeds.\"This monster has been running like this for a day and a night. I'm afraid he is almost at the end of his rope. However, he is good at using wood attribute illusion technique. He can be said to be like a fish in the water in this patch of grass. I'm afraid it's not appropriate to rush in rashly.\" Taoist Priest Qi narrowed his eyes and said.\"Do we just let him escape like this?This evildoer is so cunning at such a young age. If he is allowed to grow up, he will bring disaster to the world. \"The horse-faced man hesitated for a moment and stopped. He said unwillingly.\"We are righteous cultivators. It is our duty to exterminate monsters and subdue devils. Since this Bewitching Fox has been found by the three of us, we will not let the tiger return to the mountain.\" The burly man with a curly beard said with awe-inspiring righteousness.\"Friend Yan, it seems that you already have a countermeasure?\" Taoist Priest Qi rolled his eyes and asked.\"The area of this patch of grass is not small. If the three of us blindly chase in like this, although we can eventually capture this demon, I'm afraid it will take a lot of effort.I heard that Fellow Feng recently bought a Fire Cloud Talisman. Fellow Qi's Wind Drawing Technique can be said to have reached perfection. With the two of them working together, this patch of grass will naturally disappear. This demon will also have nowhere to hide, \"the burly man with a curly beard said slowly.\"Fire Cloud Talisman \u2026 is not impossible.However, after we capture this Bewitching Fox, its fur will belong to me. I don't want anything else. How about it? \"The horse-faced man pondered for a moment and said.\"No, this Bewitching Fox must be captured alive.\" The burly man with a curly beard shook his head and straightforwardly refused.\"What does Friend Yan mean?This Fire Cloud Talisman of mine is elementary and middle grade. It cost me a lot of money. \"The horse-faced man's face sank and his voice suddenly became cold.\"Fellow Feng, please don't be impatient. If I'm not wrong, Friend Yan should be an outer disciple of the Blood Saber Association. Not long ago, the association issued a mission. If you can capture this Bewitching Fox alive, not only will you become an inner disciple, but you will also receive a Blood Crimson Pill and a thousand spirit stones as a reward.\" Taoist Priest Qi looked at the burly man with a profound gaze and said.\"I didn't expect Fellow Qi to be so well-informed. You know so much about our Blood Saber Association.I won't beat around the bush. If the two of you can help me capture this Bewitching Fox alive, all the spirit stones will be divided equally. How about it? \"The burly man with a curly beard said to the two without changing his expression.\"Since Friend Yan has said so, I naturally have no objections.\" Taoist Priest Qi casually put the horsetail whisk in his hand on his arm.\"In that case, let's not delay any further. Let's do it.\"The horse-faced man said and took out a talisman from his bosom. After looking at it with a pained expression, he threw it forward and muttered something.The surface of the talisman suddenly glowed with a layer of red light. Then, it exploded and turned into a ball of scarlet flames. It was like a cloud of fire that pressed down on the weeds below.Whoosh!The weeds below, which were as tall as a person, were immediately set ablaze when they came into contact with the cloud of fire.When Taoist Priest Qi saw this, he said \"Immeasurable Deity\" and suddenly flung the horsetail whisk in his hand.In an instant, a loud whistling sound was heard. Several white and misty gales appeared out of thin air and spread forward in a fan-shape.The wind helped the fire, and the fire borrowed the wind. It quickly spread along the weeds like a raging wave. Black smoke billowed in midair and grass ashes flew everywhere.The three men stared at the sea of fire in front of them without blinking.\"There!\"Suddenly, Taoist Priest Qi shouted. His figure shot out like an arrow and swept towards a certain place in front of him. He shook the horsetail whisk in his hand and the surface of the whisk faintly glowed with a green light.When the burly man with curly beard and the horse-faced man heard this, their spirits were roused. They followed closely behind Taoist Priest Qi and rushed out.They saw that a petite figure suddenly scuttled out of the grass that had been eroded by the sea of fire about twenty or thirty feet ahead. It was the little girl who had previously escaped into the grass.However, at this moment, the light yellow silk dress on her body was torn in many places. Her fair face was even blackened by the smoke.She had previously hidden in this rather large area of weeds. In order to not make a sound, she had carefully changed the direction of her advance. When she heard that there was no sound coming from behind her, she thought that she could breathe a sigh of relief. She didn't expect that the other party would use fire to force her to show herself.The little girl's face was tense and her expression was full of panic. She didn't say a word and rushed forward. She seemed to be in a panic and couldn't choose where she was going. She couldn't stop coughing.As a result, she hadn't escaped far when she felt a cool breeze behind her. Dense green hair appeared and curled behind her.Almost at the same time, a \"chi chi\" sound came from above the little girl's head. A large black net about ten feet in size fell down.The little girl's eyes were filled with despair. But then, her eyes fell on a withered small tree more than ten feet in front of her. Her eyes slightly lit up and she bit the tip of her tongue.\"Got it!\"The horse-faced man was the slowest, but when he saw the little girl in front of him blocked by the curly-bearded man and the Taoist Priest Qi, he suddenly showed a look of joy.A large piece of green hair spanned several tens of feet and rolled forward, binding the little girl firmly. At the same time, a large black net fell from above.But at this moment, the figure of the immobile little girl collapsed with a flash of green light and turned into a withered small tree.\"Wood Release!\" The curly-bearded man and the Taoist Priest Qi landed and looked at the change in front of them. Their faces sank.\"There!\" The horse-faced man hurriedly pointed to a place not far ahead.The withered small tree there blurred and transformed into a little girl holding a rattle drum. After taking a glance behind her, she turned around and continued onward.\"Chase!\"Perhaps because of the use of Wood Release, the little girl's face was pale at the moment. Her footsteps also became weak. She stumbled as she ran, and her speed was greatly reduced. The distance between her and the three people behind her was quickly shortened.\"Ouch!\"The little girl exclaimed. She accidentally tripped on a Stone under her foot, and her whole body flew forward. She hit a gray boulder diagonally in front of her and fell heavily to the ground.\"Continue to run!\"When the curly-bearded man and the other two saw this, they slowed down and slowly surrounded her. The horse-faced man licked his lips and said sinisterly.Under the joint efforts of the three people, they chased this girl for almost a day and a night. Along the way, they suffered a lot from her. At this moment, they naturally had some resentment in their hearts. Especially the horse-faced man, he even used a Fire Cloud Talisman.The little girl's body was petite and exquisite. At this moment, as the three people approached step by step, her whole body clung to the boulder behind her and curled into a ball. But at this moment, her eyes were full of resentment.Seeing the expression on the little girl's face, the three naturally did not take it to heart. Instead, the horse-faced man took a step forward, raised a hand, and said gloomily:\"Although I can't kill you, I will teach you a good lesson today, you evildoer!\"At this moment, an unexpected scene happened.Only to hear a \"ka\" sound!The surface of the 10 meters tall boulder that the little girl was leaning against actually cracked with a crisp sound. Many small stones rolled down and scattered on the little girl's body and hair, making her body shiver.\"Eh?\"Seeing this, the horse-faced man let out a sound of surprise. His raised right hand was also suspended in the air. The attention of the two people also temporarily shifted from the little girl and looked at the boulder behind her.\"Ka la\"Under the gaze of the three people, the cracks on the surface of the boulder spread rapidly like a spider web. Many stone pieces peeled off from the boulder and fell to the ground.\"Ah\"The little girl obviously did not expect such a strange thing to happen to the boulder behind her. She was so scared that she closed her eyes and held her head with both hands. She did not dare to move.\"Boom\", the boulder finally shattered inch by inch in a loud sound. Large pieces of Stone splashed in all directions and fell to the ground, lifting up a piece of yellow soil.The three people were all shocked. With a vigilant look, they took a few steps back, but their eyes were still staring in the direction of the boulder.\"This \u2026 what is this?\" The horse-faced man's expression changed, and he cried out in surprise.Through the gradually settling dust, the original boulder could be found to have disappeared. Replacing it was the figure of an unusually tall man.This person was dressed in a green robe, and his hair and face were covered with a layer of grey lime. It seemed that he had been in the huge rock before this. His facial features were vaguely discernible, and his skin was slightly dark. His eyes were staring straight ahead, and he looked a little dull. However, he was a head taller than the curly-bearded man.This sudden scene left the little girl, the curly-bearded man, and the other two dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She hugged the tall Youth who had suddenly emerged from the boulder.The little girl was petite and exquisite. Her head only reached the tall Youth's waist. At this moment, a pair of fair and tender little hands were tightly hugging the Youth's thigh. Most of her body was turned sideways to hide behind the Youth. Her pair of big watery eyes were looking at the tall Youth, rolling around.The three of them were startled when they heard this. They couldn't help but look at each other. Their gazes once again fell on the tall Youth. They saw that his face was expressionless after hearing the little girl's call. He was still staring blankly in front of him. The three of them suddenly had a suspicious look on their faces.The little girl's heart tightened. Her pair of small hands that were hugging the Youth's thigh couldn't stop shaking. She cried out loudly again.\"Brother Stone, Le'Er has finally found you!These bad guys want to catch Le'Er. Brother Stone, help me beat them up! \"This time, the tall Youth seemed to have heard the little girl's cry. His head slowly drooped down.The little girl raised her head to meet the tall Youth's gaze. Her heart thumped again when she saw his empty eyes.However, when the curly-bearded man and the other two saw this, their hearts skipped a beat.They had already released their Divine Sense to sweep over the tall Youth. However, there was no trace of magic power on the person in front of them. There were two possibilities for this situation. One was that the other party was just a mortal without any cultivation. The other was that the other party had a special secret technique or magic tool that could conceal his magic power.Moreover, from the strange situation when the young man appeared and the way the little girl kept calling him \"Big Brother Stone\", the three of them faintly felt that it was very likely that the young man was the latter and might even be a member of the Demon Clan.Taoist Priest Qi rested the horsetail whisk on his arm. His eyes darted back and forth between the tall Youth and the little girl. His eyes darted back and forth, and no one knew what he was thinking.The horse-faced man had also retracted his right hand. He took a step back unknowingly and returned to the side of the bearded man and the Taoist Priest Qi. His left hand, which was hidden in the sleeve of his robe, was secretly pinching something while his eyes were fixed on the little girl.\"How should I address you?I'm Yan Cheng of the Blood Saber Association, and I'm working with the two of you to capture this bewitching fox. If you have nothing to do with this matter, please leave. \"The muscular man with curly beard asked in a probing tone after winking at his two companions.The little girl panicked and looked at the tall Youth with pleading eyes.The tall Youth slowly raised his head, and looked at the curly-bearded man in a stupefied manner. He didn't say anything.A trace of anger flashed in the eyes of the muscular man with curly beard, but he didn't flare up. Instead, he repeated what he had said before, but raised his voice.The little girl opened her mouth slightly, but didn't say anything. However, her little hand, which was grabbing onto the tall Youth's trousers, broke out in cold sweat, causing her palm to become slightly damp.The tall Youth still didn't react at all.\"This person is so suspicious. It seems that there's something wrong with him. Instead of wasting time here, why don't we \u2026\" The horse-faced man turned his body slightly, and his lips moved slightly as he transmitted his voice to the two people beside him.\"Within a radius of ten thousand miles, anyone who can remain so calm after hearing the name of the Blood Saber Association is either an immensely powerful cultivator, or a real fool.In any case, he was the one who protected the evildoer first. Even if he were to kill him, no one would say anything.Of course, I'll leave the decision to my Friend Yan. \"Taoist Priest Qi narrowed his eyes, and transmitted his voice to the other two people.The curly-bearded man nodded slightly, and his eyes gradually turned cold. He weighed the podao in his hand, and suddenly shouted, \"Your Excellency, are you looking down on the three of us?!\"His voice was loud and clear, and it echoed continuously in the wilderness. The air nearby buzzed.The little girl's little face revealed a look of fear when she heard this. She unconsciously let go of the bottom of the Youth's trousers, and tightly held onto the rattle-drum with one hand.The tall Youth didn't respond to the words of the curly-bearded man as if he were deaf.\"Alright, since Your Excellency insists on joining forces with that demoness, then \u2026 let's do it!\"An ominous glint flashed in the curly-bearded man's eyes. The podao in his hand suddenly shone with a dazzling white light, making it impossible for people to look at it directly. He suddenly raised his other hand.A black light flashed and flew out. It spun in the air, and turned into a large black net that fell down.The little girl was shocked, and hastily retreated a few steps. Unfortunately, the distance was too close, and it was too late.The large net pressed down like a black cloud, and suddenly closed up. Suddenly, it enveloped her and the tall Youth. At the same time, a cold light appeared in the net, and a silver hook appeared on each knot. The hook shone with a cold light, and looked extremely sharp.The little girl screamed, and opened her mouth to spit a cloud of blood mist onto the rattle-drum in her hand. At the same time, she twisted her wrist.Dong!A clear rattle of the rattle-drum resounded, and the little girl's body flashed with a green light. Then, her figure became blurry, and collapsed, turning into a piece of dead wood.Thump!The little girl's figure flashed a hundred feet away, and then she fell to the ground. Her hands and feet had been injured by the black net's barbs. More than a dozen wounds had appeared on her body, and blood was gushing out.She rolled and struggled to get up. But, she only took one step, and then her body went limp, and she fell to the ground again. Her face was pale, and she was gasping for breath.At this time, the curly-bearded man didn't even look at the little girl who could only wait for death. Instead, he made a hand sign with one hand, and the black net that wrapped around the tall Youth suddenly tightened.At the same time, the Taoist Priest Qi's figure had already leaped into the air, and with a flick of his wrist, more than a dozen green lights shot out. They were more than a dozen crystal-clear flying needles, and they shot toward the Youth's body at lightning speed.\"Watch out!\"Not far away, the little girl couldn't get up, but she could only scream again when she saw the situation.Ding, ding, ding!The sound of metal clashing rang out. The green flying needles were all bounced off the tall Youth's body as soon as they came into contact with him, as if they had pierced into a Stone.\"How is this possible?\" The Taoist Priest Qi, who had landed lightly on the ground, cried out involuntarily.Even if the other party was really a Stone, these flying needles should have easily pierced through it.Whoosh!A golden light suddenly flew out from the Taoist Priest's side, and after a flash, it was firmly nailed to the tall Youth's throat.\"Hehe, you've been hit by my Golden Bee Awl. It'll be hard for you not to die \u2026\" On the other side, the horse-faced man slowly lowered his raised arm, and he sneered.However, before he could finish his sentence, the Golden Bee Awl that was nailed to the Youth's throat exploded on its own, and the fragments turned into specks of golden light that fell down.\"Impossible \u2026\"The horse-faced man's expression was as if he had seen a ghost.The curly-bearded man also stared at the tall Youth's body, his face full of disbelief.The black net's hooks, which could tear through iron sheets, were hanging on the Youth's body, but they couldn't pierce the surface of his body at all.Just as the three of them were overwhelmed with shock, the Youth finally showed some reaction under the continuous attacks.He slowly lowered his head and looked at the things hanging on his body. He seemed to feel that they were a hindrance, so he moved his arm, and all ten of his fingers simultaneously grabbed the black net that was wrapped around his body.Chi La!The surface of the black net exploded with a burst of spiritual light. Then, it was torn apart like a piece of paper. It was divided into two pieces, and they gently fell to the ground.The eyes of the horse-faced man and the Taoist Priest Qi almost popped out of their sockets when they saw this.Not far away, the little girl's mouth was also wide open. She didn't even feel the sharp pain on her body.\"You \u2026 you dare to destroy my magic tool!\" The curly-bearded man roared as he witnessed this scene. He felt as if his heart was bleeding.This black net was an important treasure that he had borrowed from a good friend of his without sparing a lot of money. Today, it had been inexplicably destroyed here. How could he not be shocked and angry at the same time?The curly-bearded man gnashed his teeth as he looked at the tall Youth. He pinched two of his fingers together, and a purple charm appeared on his fingertips out of thin air. He threw it with one hand, and chanted an incantation. The charm immediately flew out, and swept over the top of the tall Youth's head.With a \"pu\" sound, the talisman shattered into pieces and turned into a thick black leaden cloud.The black leaden cloud flashed with a thunderous sound, and a silver arc of lightning as thick as the mouth of a bowl struck down from the black cloud.\"Boom!\" There was a loud noise.The thick arc of lightning bombarded the tall Youth's body. Countless arcs of lightning scattered in all directions, and cracked the ground around him. Consequently, a ghastly black pit was formed.The little girl closed her eyes in fright when she heard the roar of thunder. She didn't know where she got her strength from, but she used her hands to push herself back a few steps. She managed to avoid the aftermath of the lightning by a hair's breadth.As a result, she opened her eyes with a lingering fear in her heart. She opened and closed her mouth, and nearly bit her tongue.The tall Youth stood calmly on the bumpy ground. But, there wasn't the slightest injury on his body.The curly-bearded man was shocked. But, he didn't stop moving his hands. Instead, he quickly mumbled an incantation, and formed a magic sign with his hands.\"Bind!\"Another silver arc of lightning fell from the sky. Then, it suddenly changed, and intertwined with each other. Then, it transformed into a chain of lightning light. Then, it rapidly wound around the tall Youth's body, and tied him up firmly.\"My two friends, what are you waiting for if not now?!\"The curly-bearded man growled. He held the podao in his hand horizontally in front of him. Suddenly, a layer of red light appeared in his hand. Then, he leaped forward, and fiercely slashed at the tall Youth's face with his podao.The horse-faced man was also surprised by the fact that the power of lightning couldn't hurt the Youth. But, he was overjoyed when he saw the situation. He formed a magic sign with one hand, and his figure suddenly turned into a light breeze, and disappeared from where he stood.The next moment, a gust of wind rolled up from the side of the tall Youth, and the horse-faced man flashed out of it. A black iron ruler appeared in his hand. The surface of the ruler was flashing with a few white runes. Then, he smashed the ruler towards the tall Youth's shoulder with an evil gust of wind.Taoist Priest Qi's eyes flickered. He didn't rush out after the two men. Instead, he took two steps back and waved his hand. A mass of blood-red light flew out from his sleeve. It flew in a circle in the air at lightning speed, and silently smashed towards the back of the tall Youth's head.Although the three of them attacked at different times, they had a tacit understanding of each other. It was obvious that this wasn't the first time they had worked together.The tall Youth's eyes were dull, and he stood motionless in the same place. It was as if he didn't see the attack in front of him.The eyes of the curly-bearded man flickered with joy when he saw this. He unconsciously increased the strength of his podao by 30%.But, he suddenly felt his wrist tighten the next moment. It was as if a big hand made of steel had firmly grabbed him. Not only could the pouncing knife not move down, but even his rushing figure came to a screeching halt. He couldn't move forward anymore.The tall Youth stretched out his arm, and his five fingers were like hooks as he grabbed the wrist of the man who was holding the knife. His movement was so fast that it was almost impossible to see it clearly.The curly-bearded man exerted all his strength to pull back. But, it was as if he was rooted to the ground. He couldn't shake his opponent's arm at all. His heart turned cold at first, but the corners of his mouth immediately revealed a cruel smile.\"Bang!\"\"Pfft!\"The iron ruler of the horse-faced man and the blood-colored ball of light released by the Taoist Priest Qi hit the tall Youth's shoulder and the back of his head almost at the same time. One emitted a glaring black light, while the other shattered like porcelain. It turned into a thick bloody mist that shrouded the entire head of the Youth. At the same time, it emitted a pungent smell that made one want to vomit.\"Haha!\"The horse-faced man had just laughed out loud when he felt his fingers heat up in the next moment. An indescribable, raging wave of power erupted from the tall young man's body and spread to his body through the iron ruler.\"No!\"The horse-faced man revealed a horrified expression. He only had time to say one word before his body flew backward involuntarily. When he landed far away, there was a series of cracking sounds in his body. He didn't know how many bones were broken. Blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs spurted out of his mouth.His whole body was like a broken sack riddled with holes. He was no longer breathing.\"Impossible, you \u2026 Ah \u2026\"The curly-bearded man turned pale with fright, but he didn't have time to do anything to salvage the situation. The five fingers that grabbed his wrist shook, and a strange vibration spread. The bones in his body instantly shattered. The pain was as if he was being cut by a thousand knives. The big man couldn't help but let out an extremely shrill scream.\"Whoosh!\"The curly-bearded man couldn't help but rise into the air. He was ruthlessly thrown onto a boulder not far away.\"Boom!\"As the big man screamed, his whole body exploded on the boulder and turned into a pile of minced meat.This series of actions happened in the blink of an eye like a spark from a flint.The Taoist Priest Qi's face turned ashen when he saw all this. He suddenly turned around and madly patted five or six talismans of different colors on his body. At the same time, he started to run wildly in the direction he came from.However, he only had time to run a few steps before he felt the air around him tighten. Several protective spiritual lights on his body flashed and extinguished. Then, his whole body exploded with a \"Bang!\" as if an invisible giant had pinched it in the air like a toy. It turned into a rain of blood and flesh.\"Huff!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe little girl stared blankly at everything that had happened in front of her. Her small mouth was half open, as if she had yet to recover from the shock.She stared blankly at the corpses of the curly-bearded man and the other two. Her body went limp and she sat down on the ground. Two streams of tears flowed from her eyes.At first, she was only sobbing softly. Then, as if she had thought of something sad, her cries suddenly became louder.Like a river bursting through a dike, her cries once again broke the silence of the wasteland. It was like a heartbreaking lament, pouring out the frustrations and injustices of the world to the Heavens.After an unknown amount of time, the cries stopped abruptly.The little girl stood up again, clenching her delicate fists. The blackness and bloodstains on her small face had been washed away by her tears, revealing a beautiful and delicate face once again. However, there seemed to be something more in her big eyes than before.Suddenly, she lifted her leg and ran toward another greyish-white boulder not far in front of her.Beneath the boulder, a badly mutilated body lay in a pool of blood. It was vaguely discernible that it was the curly-bearded man. He had died a long time ago. Dozens of feet away from the boulder, there was a short man's corpse that looked like mud. It should be the horse-faced man from before.As for the Taoist Priest Qi, his entire body had exploded under the punch of the tall Youth. It could be said that there were no bones left. Only some minced flesh and bloodstains could be seen nearby.The little girl leaped to the bottom of the boulder. When she raised her hands, green fingernails that were several inches long suddenly grew out of her ten fingers. She waved them at the remains of the curly-bearded man.The sound of something tearing through the air could be heard. Streaks of green claws shot out and struck the remains of the man.Blood splattered everywhere. In the blink of an eye, the already badly mutilated body was torn into a pile of minced flesh.She seemed to have not vented her hatred. She opened her mouth and spat out a green flame, turning the minced flesh into ashes.Then, she did the same thing to the horse-faced man's corpse. Only then did she stop.When she was done, the little girl's knees gave way. She sat on the ground again, panting.The magic power that she had just recovered was exhausted once again.\"Father, Mother, Big Brother, Second Sister \u2026 One of the Blood Saber Society's villains has finally died. Although I didn't personally kill him, you have finally taken some revenge.Don't worry, as long as I still have a breath left in me, there will be a day when I kill my way up to Bloodlight Mountain and make the Bloodblade Association disappear from this world. \"The girl calmed down a little and moved her body. She knelt down in a direction and murmured.After saying this, the little girl's eyes turned red again. She was on the verge of tears, but she forcefully held them back.\"Don't cry. Dad said that people who cry often won't grow up. I want to grow up quickly!\"After a while, the little girl finally suppressed her sobs and stood up again. She glanced at the storage bags of the three men on the ground.Her expression was somewhat disgusted, but after a slight hesitation, she still picked up all these things and put them away.As the blazing sun moved westward, the sky became a little dusky. The wind gradually became stronger, whistling, and the temperature also became a little cooler.Looking at the bleak surroundings, the little girl could not help but feel a little afraid. She curled up her body slightly and subconsciously moved closer to the only living person beside her, the tall Youth.After the tall Youth threw that punch, he once again returned to his previous sluggish appearance. He stood woodenly on the ground and looked down at his feet. It was as if he did not hear what the little girl had just done.\"This \u2026 Brother Stone \u2026\" The little girl did not dare to get too close. She hesitantly called out softly.The tall Youth did not respond.\"Brother Stone, my name is Liu Le 'er. Thank you for killing those three villains.Although you are also a human, father said that there are good people among the human race, \"the little girl said timidly.The tall Youth's body moved a little. He finally had some reaction. He raised his head slightly and glanced at Liu Le 'er.The little girl's figure was reflected in his eyes. There seemed to be a flash of light in his sluggish eyes. Then, they became muddle-headed again. However, his eyes were still looking at Liu Le 'er.This made Liu Le 'er jump in fright. She quickly took a few steps back.However, the tall Youth only looked at her blankly. He did not do anything else. He did not move at all.Liu Le 'er secretly let out a sigh of relief. She was even more certain that there was something wrong with the Youth's brain. She gradually became more courageous. She tried to walk a little closer, and curiously looked at the person in front of her.She did not have time to look carefully in her panic. Now that she walked a little closer, Liu Le 'er could see more clearly.This Youth was tall and had slender fingers. The muscles on his body were not very thick, but he gave off a feeling of infinite power.Although his eyes were blank and lifeless, his pupils were incomparably black. If one looked at them for a long time, they would feel as if their souls would be sucked into them. His exposed skin was dark and smooth. After the fierce battle just now, there was not a single scar left on his skin.The green clothes on his body looked ordinary. He had just been cut by the Thunder Strike Saber, but he did not suffer any damage.All of this, in addition to the fact that the Youth had sucked the unusual blood mist into his mouth, showed that he was definitely not an ordinary person. He was definitely not a mortal.How could a mortal kill three cultivators with magic weapons in just two or three moves?The little girl looked at the tall Youth in a daze. The tall Youth still did not have any reaction. She became more and more relaxed. Perhaps it was because of her childlike nature after the disaster, she walked around the tall Youth.The Youth's eyes never left Liu Le 'er. It seemed that there was something about Liu Le' er that attracted him.Perhaps it was because of the Youth's appearance that she escaped the disaster and helped her kill three enemies. The little girl felt that the tall Youth in front of her was becoming more and more amiable.\"Eh!\"Liu Le 'er suddenly exclaimed. On the chest of the tall Youth, there was a small dark green ornament. It was crystal clear, but she did not know what it was.She wanted to lift his clothes to take a closer look, but she did not dare to.At that moment, the wind around them grew stronger. The clouds in the sky surged, and a large patch of dark clouds appeared. The dark clouds hung low, making the surrounding light even darker.\"Kaboom!\"A thick bolt of lightning tore through the dark clouds, illuminating half the sky. There was a loud sound of thunder, and raindrops poured down.\"Ah!\"Liu Le 'er let out a cry of surprise. She subconsciously hid under the tall Youth's body and hugged the Youth's thigh. Her petite body was shivering.She was a Demon Fox, so she had an inexplicable fear of lightning.The tall Youth's eyes glowed faintly, but it soon dimmed again. It was unknown whether it was intentional or not, but he slightly bowed his body. His tall body covered Liu Le 'er, blocking the endless wind and rain outside.The little girl felt a surge of warmth in her heart. At that moment, she was no longer afraid of the wind and rain outside. Instead, she felt at ease. This feeling was just like when she was in her father's arms.The rain came and went quickly. It didn't take long for the clouds to disperse, and a fresh scent of grass and trees spread out.Liu Le 'er shook off the rain on her body and giggled. She pulled the tall Youth's hand and flicked the water off his clothes.The green clothes on her body were made of an unknown material. When the rain fell on it, it was like the skin of a lotus leaf, rolling and condensing into water droplets. It was impossible to soak in.The tall Youth didn't say anything about the little girl's action, but he didn't oppose it either. He just let her do whatever she wanted.\"That's right, Brother Stone, Le 'er still doesn't know your name.\" Liu Le' er pulled the tall Youth and tried to make him sit down.The tall Youth listened to her and slowly sat down. However, he still didn't say anything.\"Brother Stone, why are you here?\"\"Brother Stone, that punch was so powerful. Can you teach it to Le 'er?\"\"Brother Stone \u2026\"Liu Le 'er didn't want to give up. She tried several ways to communicate with the Youth, but no matter what she said, the Youth didn't respond. She couldn't help but feel disappointed again.\"Brother Stone, although I don't know who you are, you killed a member of the Blood Saber Gang. You should leave with me.\"The little girl thought for a while and finally made up her mind. She grabbed the wide palm of the tall Youth and begged.Although the tall Youth was muddle-headed, he seemed to understand something after Liu Le 'er talked and gestured for a while. He blinked his eyes and finally left with the little girl.The sky gradually darkened, and the setting sun was like blood.The entire wasteland was bathed in the afterglow of the setting sun and became a little golden.The two figures, one big and one small, walked towards the direction of the setting sun and gradually went further away. The faint sound of Liu Le 'er's joyful voice could be faintly heard in the wind.\"Brother Stone, I know you are very powerful, but there are still many bad guys in the Blood Saber Gang!\"\"It's getting late. You must be hungry.\"\"When we leave this place, Le 'er will catch a few wild birds and roast them for you to eat.Le 'er's cooking is not bad! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay(The first two months of the new book will be free, with one update per day.After it is officially published, there will be two updates per day!)In a lush and luxuriant wasteland forest.The biting cold wind howled incessantly, and the feather-like snowflakes fluttered in the air, turning everything white.Although the sun had not completely set, the forest was already very dark under the curtain of snow.An inconspicuous mountain road in the forest was winding and almost indistinguishable under the thick layer of snow. At the end of the road was a glimmer of fire, revealing some warmth in the world of ice and snow.At the place where the fire was lit was the only Mountain Deity Temple in the forest of a thousand miles.Because of the lack of people, this Mountain Deity Temple had long lost its incense and had been abandoned for many years. The gate tower and courtyard walls of the outer courtyard had long collapsed, leaving only a dilapidated main hall standing alone in the same place.The main hall's door had long disappeared, and a shabby straw mat was half-covered by the door frame, hastily blocking the wind and snow outside the hall.Through the hole in the straw mat, one could see that in the empty main hall, apart from some messy withered grass and bricks, there was a figure sitting cross-legged in the middle.It was a tall young man in azure clothes. Even if he was sitting on the ground, his figure still seemed to be extremely tall and straight, yet his face just happened to be emotionless and stiff to the extreme. It was just like the damaged clay statue behind him, stiff, lifeless, and lacking vitality.The tall Youth crossed his arms in front of his chest, and in the crook of his arms lay a slender and small girl. It was the little fox demon Liu Le'er.\"Uh \u2026\"At this moment, a low moan suddenly came from the Youth's arms.Liu Le'er's little head arched against the Youth's arms, and her cheeks, which were originally buried deep in his chest, moved a little outwards, revealing her face from his arms.That originally beautiful and tender little face was now sickly red. She was clearly still asleep, but her pair of delicate eyebrows were tightly knitted together, and under her closed eyes, her eyeballs kept rolling left and right, as if she was experiencing an extremely terrible dream.\"No \u2026 don't \u2026 wuu \u2026\"Accompanied by the ravings, Liu Le'er subconsciously tightened her arms around Youth's arm.Half of her calf had also been kicked out from Youth's embrace. Her body wriggled a few times from time to time, looking very unsteady. Her little face that had just shifted away was now buried back into Youth's chest.The Youth, who was originally looking straight ahead, seemed to have sensed something. He lowered his head and looked at the girl in his arms. There was a slight change in his blank eyes. He seemed to be a little confused, but he was still at a loss.\"Brother \u2026 Stone \u2026\"Another wave of indistinct sleep-talking came from the Youth's chest. It was as soft as the buzzing of a mosquito, almost undetectable.Perhaps it was because of the light from the fire, but the tall Youth's face seemed to have softened a little. His originally empty eyes seemed to have brightened up a little.He didn't get up, but sat on the ground and shifted his position. He used half of his body to block the cold wind that leaked in. His arm moved a little bit, wrapping the girl's outstretched calf back into his embrace, and slightly hugged it a little tighter.The girl's body shook and rubbed a few times in his embrace. Her little head arched into his chest. Her movements slowly stopped, and her breathing gradually stabilized.The sky outside the hall had already turned dark, and the wanton wind and snow between the heaven and earth had gradually weakened.\u2026Halfway up a green mountain peak, there was a cave entrance that was more than 30 feet high. A tall Youth stood with his back facing the cave entrance.Liu Le'er stood behind the Youth. She pulled the corner of Youth's clothes with one hand, and hugged his thigh with the other. She slightly stretched out half of her small face to look ahead. Her small face was a little pale because of nervousness.A few feet in front of the two of them, there was a giant gray bear that was as tall as two adults. Its hind paws were on the ground, and its forelimbs were raised up.There was a single ferocious horn on his head that was like a white bone. He opened his protruding bloody mouth, and the corners of his lips curled up, revealing his cold and sharp white teeth. He bared his teeth and growled, and a line of stinky and slightly sticky saliva flowed out of the corner of his mouth.The tall Youth in front of this giant bear looked as thin and weak as a child.However, there was not the slightest expression on his face. He just stared straight at the giant bear. His dark eyes were like ink, and there was not much luster.The giant bear stared at the tall young man's face for a moment. For some reason, its face suddenly revealed a somewhat human-like expression of fear. It suddenly let out a low roar and took two steps back. Then, it turned around and dropped its forelimbs, running away with its four legs.Liu Le'er saw this scene, and her expression relaxed. She sighed in relief, and then scratched her head in puzzlement. She went around to the tall Youth, and looked up at him.She stared at the wooden face of the Youth for a long time, but couldn't see anything strange. She couldn't help but show a little disappointment.\"Brother Stone, Le'er knows that you are not an ordinary person. But it's a pity that you can't speak. Otherwise, you can say something to Le'er. Sigh \u2026\" Liu Le'er sighed like a little adult. She held the big hand of the Youth, and turned around to walk back to the cave on the mountainside.The Youth didn't say anything. His lowered eyes fell on the little girl's white hand that was holding his. His body was pulled by the girl, and they gradually walked into the cave.\u2026 \u2026On an unknown vast grassland, it was the height of spring, and the grass was long and the nightingales were flying. The new spring buds of the grass had already sprouted, and the whole grassland was filled with the unique fresh fragrance of grass.A girl about eight or nine years old was carrying a cluster of slender rattan that was covered with pale yellow flowers. She was riding on the shoulder of a tall and straight young man as they moved forward leisurely.Compared to two years ago, the Youth hadn't changed at all. He was still wearing the same green clothes, but Liu Le'er was very different from before.The girl's figure had grown a lot, and the childishness on her small face had faded. Her eyebrows showed a little softness that was rare for ordinary girls. It was obvious that she was a rare beauty, and it was unknown whether she would be able to cause the downfall of a city or a country in the future.Her ten fingers moved quickly, weaving the yellow flower rattan in her hand. She was also humming a light tune. Her voice was clear and pleasant, like the chirping of an oriole.\"It's done \u2026\"Before the song ended, Liu Le'er's hand stopped moving, and a beautiful flower wreath was formed.She held the wreath with both hands, and looked at it in a circle. She nodded with satisfaction, and happily put the wreath on the Youth's head.The size of the wreath was just right, and the densest part of the flower fell on the Youth's forehead.The tall Youth seemed to feel something, and he raised his hand to touch the wreath, and then slowly withdrew his hand.Liu Le'er was already used to the tall Youth's reaction. She looked down and saw the green string on his neck. She covered her mouth and smiled. She mischievously stretched out her hand to grab the string, and was about to lift it up.However, the Youth below her seemed to react instinctively. He grabbed the dark green ornament tied to the string in front of his chest, and refused to let go for a long time.\"Brother Stone is stingy. He does this every time. I'm just curious \u2026\" Liu Le'er's cheeks puffed up.Although she said so, she was not really angry. The Brother Stone under her had never spoken to her in the past two years, and he rarely reacted to the outside world. Only when this ornament was involved would he take the initiative to respond.Because of this, Liu Le'er would occasionally tease the Youth with this.\u2026Time flew by like a white steed, and several years passed in a hurry.A beautiful thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl in a white dress walked briskly on an official road paved with yellow sand. Her black hair reached her waist, and her hands were clasped behind her back.Behind her, there was a tall man in a green robe. His expression was dull, and his pace was slow.One of them was fast, and the other was slow. However, their steps were small, and the distance between them was not too big.Liu Le'er, who was walking in the front, saw a magnificent green city at the end of the official road. She could see many people coming and going at the city gate, and they were as small as sparrows.She frowned and stopped walking.\"Ming \u2026 Yuan City \u2026\" Liu Le'er squinted her eyes and looked at the city for a while, and then slowly called out.The tall Youth walked to her side and also stopped. He looked at the magnificent city in the distance.\"It looks like a big city of the human race \u2026\" Liu Le'er whispered with a hesitant expression.In the past five years, in order to cure the tall Youth's dementia, the two of them had entered some human towns. However, they had never been close to a city as big as the one in front of them.\"Brother Stone, if you are completely cured, can you help Le'er take revenge?\" Liu Le'er looked up at the Youth and said in a low voice. It was unknown whether she was asking him or herself.The Youth seemed to have some reaction when he heard this. He slowly withdrew his gaze from the distance and looked at the girl. However, he still didn't say anything.\"What nonsense am I talking about? Even if Brother Stone is powerful, how can he defeat so many bad guys from the Blood Knife Association?\"Liu Le 'er seemed to have thought of something again. She lowered her head with a gloomy expression, but her tears fell disappointingly and seeped into the yellow sand on the ground.At this moment, she suddenly felt a weight on her head, and a warm touch came to her.She slightly raised her head and saw her \"Brother Stone\" raising his hand and gently caressing her head. His eyes were especially gentle.She didn't know why, but Liu Le'er felt very safe at this moment. She felt an indescribable courage in her body. It seemed that no matter how big the difficulty was, she wouldn't be afraid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMingyuan City was the third largest city in the Toyokuni territory.The city was located on a plain, covering an area of a hundred miles. A large river meandered through the southern part of the city. Both land and water transportation were extremely convenient, which contributed to the prosperity of the city.At this time, there was a long queue of people entering the city. It was noisy.Liu Le 'er dragged the tall Youth along with her. She felt a little uneasy, and her eyes occasionally glanced at the top of the city gate.An octagonal bronze mirror was hanging there, facing the city gate.The sun was high up in the sky. The Eight Trigrams pattern carved on the bronze mirror shone under the sunlight, emitting a majestic and auspicious aura.One only needed to pay some money to the guards to enter the city. The inspection didn't seem to be strict. Soon, it was Liu Le 'er and the Youth's turn.The two arrived at the city gate, facing the Eight Trigrams bronze mirror. An inexplicable force enveloped the two.Liu Le 'er's body stiffened, and she lowered her head.The tall Youth looked straight at the Eight Trigrams bronze mirror. His eyes were dull, but no one noticed that there was a flash of blue light in the depths of his eyes. However, the bronze mirror didn't show the slightest change.\"Where are you from?What do you want to do in the city? \"A middle-aged gate guard glanced at the two and asked lazily.\"Brothers, we are from the Liu Town, three hundred miles northwest of the city. My name is Liu Le 'er, and this is my elder brother, Liu Shi. We came to the city to visit our relatives, and also to treat my elder brother's illness,\" Liu Le' er said quickly with a smile on her face.Although she and the tall Youth depended on each other for survival these years, they still couldn't avoid contact with outsiders. For convenience's sake, she gave this \"Brother Stone\" the name Liu Shi.As she spoke, Liu Le 'er quickly took out some copper coins and handed them to the guard. It was a little more than the entrance fee.When the middle-aged guard saw this, a trace of satisfaction appeared on his face. He put the extra copper coins into his pocket without batting an eyelid. He glanced at the somewhat dull and tall young man, Liu Shi, and waved his hand without asking any more questions.He waved his hand and said, \"You and your sister can't be bad people. Let's go in.\"Liu Le 'er agreed and pulled Liu Shi into the city quickly. After walking for a long distance, they were far away from the city gate. Then, they slowed down in an empty corner and breathed a sigh of relief.\"Fortunately, I still have the Qi Drawing Talisman my father gave me. It can conceal my Monster Qi and prevent me from being discovered by the Demon-revealing Mirror.Liu Le 'er looked around and saw that no one was paying attention. She muttered a few words before taking out a green jade talisman from her arms.The jade talisman was two inches long and two fingers wide. It was engraved with cyan patterns, forming a complicated magic formation. Gentle cyan light flowed on top of it like flowing water.She looked at the talisman in her hand. of. and carefully, she hid the talisman.After passing through two alleys, the two arrived at the main street of Mingyuan City.The street was wide enough for three carriages to travel side by side. Both sides of the street were lined with tall and spacious buildings that stretched as far as the eye could see.However, there weren't many bricks and tiles here. Most of the buildings were made of wood. Although the buildings weren't very tall, and there were very few that were over thirty meters tall, they were exquisite and delicate, making them quite novel.This was the first time Liu Le 'er had come to such a large city like Mingyuan City. The bustling crowd made her feel somewhat afraid, and she stuck close to Liu Shi.However, although the crowd was like a river, everyone went about their own business. No one came to disturb the two, causing her to gradually relax. Her attention was drawn to the various new things in the city, and she pulled Liu Shi along as they strolled through the streets in high spirits.\"Brother Stone, look over there!I've heard of that thing. It looks really delicious. \"Liu Le 'er stared fixedly at a nearby vendor selling candied haws.Liu Shi's dark eyes reflected the lively scene around him. His face was expressionless, as if he was completely indifferent to all of this.Liu Le 'er was just about to pull Liu Shi over when she saw the Youth's expression. She felt a wave of disappointment in her heart, and immediately remembered the purpose of their trip to the city. She hurriedly grasped Youth's hand and earnestly said, \"Brother Stone, don't worry.\"Brother Stone, don't worry. This city is so big, there will definitely be a doctor who can cure you.\"Liu Shi's eyes flickered when he heard this.Liu Le 'er pulled Liu Shi to a street food stall to eat. After asking around, she quickly learned the location of two nearby medical centers.West of the city, Li's Medical Centre.Li's Medical Centre had been practicing medicine in this area for a hundred years. It could be considered as a time-honored brand.A middle-aged man dressed in a green robe was sitting upright on a wooden chair. Three fingers were pressed on Liu Shi's wrist, and he was attentively checking his pulse. Liu Le 'er stood nervously at the side.This middle-aged man was called Li Changqing. He was the current successor of Li's Medical Centre. He was a famous doctor in the area, and he had been practicing medicine for more than twenty years.After checking his pulse for a while, Li Changqing retracted his palm.\"Your Elder Brother's six meridians are smooth and strong. His Qi and blood are abundant. His body is obviously in excellent condition. How could he suffer from soullessness?When did this illness appear?Is there any external cause? \"Li Changqing frowned and looked at Liu Le 'er.\"I haven't seen my elder brother for many years. I don't know the cause of his illness.\" Liu Le 'er shook her head.\"Then it's difficult. If we don't know the cause, we can't treat it.Please forgive me for my shallow medical knowledge. I have the heart, but I am powerless. \"Li Changqing stroked his long beard and said apologetically.\"Do you really have no clue?\" Liu Le 'er asked anxiously.\"This old man is powerless.\" Li Changqing shook his head.Liu Le 'er was disappointed. She bowed to Li Changqing and led Liu Shi out of the medical centre.\"There are many medical centres in Mingyuan City. We will visit them one by one. We will definitely be able to cure you.\"The young girl hung her head dejectedly for a while. She quickly cheered Liu Shi on.Liu Shi grinned. It was unknown if he understood Liu Le 'er's words.The two of them walked in the same direction. After passing through two streets, they arrived in front of another medical centre.This medical centre had a grey outer wall, a black roof, and a wide entrance. It exuded a luxurious atmosphere. It was much grander than Li's Medical Centre. There were also many people who came to seek medical treatment.\"This medical centre is so big. The doctors inside must be even more skilled.\" Liu Le 'er was filled with anticipation. She pulled Liu Shi inside.After half an hour, the two of them walked out. The young girl's face was still filled with disappointment.\"There's no hurry. There are other medical centres.\" Liu Le 'er quickly regained her spirits.For the next half of the day, the two of them walked through the streets and alleys. They visited almost all the medical centres in Mingyuan City. However, none of the doctors could do anything about Liu Shi's illness.\u2026North of the city, Nokikusai.Two figures slowly walked out. They were Liu Le 'er and Liu Shi.Liu Le 'er looked disappointed. She lowered her head and played with the corner of her clothes.Although Nokikusai wasn't the largest medical centre in Mingyuan City, it was said that the doctors here were quite knowledgeable about difficult diseases. Unfortunately, they couldn't figure out the cause of Liu Shi's illness.\"Young lady, please wait.\"At that moment, a voice came from behind. A grey-haired, green-robed old man quickly caught up with them.\"Doctor Liu.\" Liu Le 'er was slightly surprised. She stopped in her tracks.This green-robed old man was the one who had taken Liu Shi's pulse. He was the doctor in charge of Nokikusai.\"Could it be that you've thought of something about my elder brother's illness?\" Liu Le 'er asked hurriedly. A glimmer of hope suddenly appeared in her heart.\"Yes. Just now, after I treated Your Elder Brother, I went to the back hall to read some medical books. I happened to see a medical case that is quite similar to Your Elder Brother's condition.\" The green-robed old man nodded.\"Doctor, please tell me.\" Liu Le 'er was overjoyed when she heard this.\"According to the book, Your Elder Brother's condition is very different from normal soullessness. He was cursed, or his soul was injured by a restriction.This kind of injury isn't something an ordinary doctor can treat. Only an immortal master who is skilled in this field can cure him.As for his inability to speak, it's a small matter. Your Elder Brother's tongue is fine. As long as his soul returns to normal, he will naturally speak, \"the green-robed old man continued.After listening to this, Liu Le 'er fell silent. After a while, she forced out a cute smile.\"Thank you for your guidance, Doctor Liu.\"\"Young lady, you're too polite. Treating and saving people is the duty of us doctors.\" The green-robed old man shook his head and returned to the house.Liu Le 'er walked out of Nokikusai with the Youth. She was depressed.\"Alas, Brother Stone's condition really is that his soul was injured.\" The young girl muttered to herself.She was a fox demon. Even though she was young, she had some knowledge of cultivation and the Dao. In these past few years, based on Liu Shi's unusual state, she'd faintly guessed that his soul might have been injured by someone.If she wanted to treat him, she would need to seek help from cultivators who were proficient in the Way of the Soul.However, such cultivators were extremely powerful. She was not sure that she could hide from them with just an Aura Attracting Talisman.The two of them came to Mingyuan City to seek medical help with the hope that they had guessed wrong. However, it seemed that things did not go as they wished.Liu Le 'er could not help but hesitate.Just as she was frowning, there was a sudden commotion on the street in front of her. The pedestrians on the street were in a mess.\"The horses are scared!\"\"Get out of the way!\"Cries of alarm came from the front. The crowd was in a mess, desperately running to the sides.Not far away, a silver carriage was pulled by a strange green horse covered in scales. It was madly galloping towards where Liu Le 'er and Liu Shi were.The strange green horse neighed as if it had gone mad. The carriage shook left and right behind it. The driver's face was as white as a sheet. He desperately pulled the reins, but it was of no use.Liu Le 'er was shocked. She wanted to pull the Youth away, but it was too late.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Ah!\"Liu Le 'er wanted to cast a spell to block the strange green horse. However, her mind was shaken, and the magic power in her body wasn't working properly. She couldn't help but cry out in alarm.At this critical moment, she only saw darkness in front of her. It was Liu Shi who suddenly took a step forward. His tall body stood in front of her. Simultaneously, he stretched out his hand like lightning, and grabbed the bucket-thick neck of the strange green horse. His body leaned to the side, and collided with the strange green horse.\"Bang!\" A loud sound was heard!The strange green horse neighed loudly, and its huge body abruptly stopped in place as if it had hit a huge wall. Due to its excessive momentum, even the hard stone slabs on the nearby streets were smashed into pieces by the iron hooves.The silver carriage, under the effect of inertia, hit the rear of the strange green horse. It flew sideways for several feet, and heavily fell to the ground with a 'bang'.Although the carriage didn't turn upside down, its shape was greatly changed, and a variety of miscellaneous things fell to the ground.The driver of the carriage didn't sit steadily, and almost fell from the carriage.The tall Youth was like a nail, and didn't move an inch.When the people nearby saw this scene, they were instantly dumbfounded. Someone in a teahouse even let out an exclamation of \"divine power\".Liu Le 'er patted her chest. She looked at the tall figure in front of her, and her heart felt slightly warm.But in the past few years, every time she encountered danger, 'Brother Stone' would subconsciously step forward to help her.The relationship between the two of them was no longer that of family.The strange green horse became even more manic when it was blocked by Liu Shi. It neighed, and lowered its head. Its huge head fiercely hit Liu Shi's chest.\"Brother Stone, be careful!\" Liu Le 'er was startled.Liu Shi was expressionless. He increased the strength of his arm that was holding the horse's neck, and pressed it down.\"Plop!\" The strange horse's four legs bent, and its huge body was directly pressed down on the ground. The surrounding stone slabs were all shattered.Its entire body felt like it was being crushed by a mountain, and its bones were about to fall apart. The blood-red light in its eyes faded away, replaced by a look of fear.Facing Liu Shi, whose strength far exceeded its own, the strange horse finally became obedient. It lay on the ground obediently, not daring to move.\"Such great strength!The impact force of this horse beast is probably no less than four or five thousand Jin, but this person can actually block it so easily! \"\"Amazing!\"\"I say, whose family's carriage is this? It actually dares to gallop so casually in the busy city. If it wasn't for this hero stopping it, who knows how many people would have suffered!\"Most of the surrounding people finally reacted and began to discuss among themselves.Only then did Liu Shi release his arm and stand motionless on the spot.Although the strange green horse was no longer restrained, it still panted heavily, not daring to stand up from the ground.\"Brother Stone, are you alright?\" Liu Le'er hurriedly went forward to check on Liu Shi's body. Seeing that he was fine, she heaved a sigh of relief.The coachman's face had already turned pale. Seeing that the strange horse had been subdued, his whole body went limp on the shaft of the carriage.At this moment, the carriage door was pushed open, and two pale-faced young men jumped out.The one in front was a handsome man in his twenties, dressed in a moon-white scholarly robe.The other person appeared to be only seventeen or eighteen years old. His face was like a beautiful jade, his eyes were black and white, and his lips were red and teeth white. He wore a snow-white robe, a jade belt around his waist, and a jade crown on his head, which was inlaid with a pearl the size of a pigeon's egg. His elegant demeanor was far superior to that of his scholarly companion.\"You dog slave, how can you drive a carriage? You almost fell and killed this young master!\"The scholarly robed Youth's face was full of fear. He grabbed the horsewhip from the coachman's hand, and began to whip the coachman's face.The coachman's body was covered in bloody marks, but he didn't dare to dodge. He knelt on the ground and repeatedly kowtowed to beg for mercy.The scholarly robed Youth saw this, but his expression became even more angry, and he began to whip the coachman even more quickly.\"Shut up, it's the people of Yu Prefecture!\"\"This has nothing to do with us. Don't talk anymore.\"\u2026The surrounding discussions came to a screeching halt when they saw the two men's faces. Everyone looked at the two men with submissive gazes. It was obvious that they recognized them.\"Second Brother, forget it.This matter can't be blamed on him. After all, this Azure Wind Horse is a low-level monster beast. It's wild and difficult to tame. \"An arm suddenly stretched out and grabbed the scholarly robed man's wrist. The horsewhip immediately stopped. It was the younger white-robed youth. His voice was like the gurgling of spring water, and it was exceptionally pleasant to listen to.The scholarly robed Youth glanced at the white-robed youth, and the corner of his mouth twitched. He then snorted and threw away the horsewhip.\"Thank you, Seventh Young Master!\" The coachman repeatedly kowtowed to the white-robed youth.\"Get up. Take this silver and compensate the people and shops that were injured by the carriage.If you handle this matter well, your punishment will be reduced. \"The white-robed youth took out a bag and gave it to the coachman.\"Yes, yes.\" The coachman repeatedly nodded. He took the silver and walked towards the injured people.\"Thanks to this brother for subduing the Azure Wind Horse. Our injuries are a small matter. If others were injured, even ten thousand deaths wouldn't be enough to atone for it.\" The white-robed youth turned to look at Liu Shi and smiled as he bowed.When the scholarly robed Youth saw this, he also looked at Liu Shi. He saw that Liu Shi's appearance was ordinary, his skin was dark, and he wore a simple and crude green robe. The scholarly robe looked somewhat shabby. His expression suddenly became somewhat contemptuous, and he reluctantly cupped his hands.Liu Shi's gaze was wooden, and he also didn't say a word.The scholarly robed Youth had never been ignored like this. His expression suddenly became sullen, and he was about to erupt. However, he was stopped by the white-robed youth.The youth carefully sized up Liu Shi. He noticed that there was something strange in Liu Shi's eyes, and his heart suddenly stirred.There were more and more people around them. Liu Le 'er couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. She pulled Liu Shi and whispered, \"Brother Stone, let's go.\"The white-robed youth only noticed Liu Le 'er at this moment. After he saw her delicate porcelain doll-like face, his eyes suddenly lit up. He quickly caught up to them and stopped them.\"You two, please wait.\"\"What's the matter?\" Liu Le 'er stopped and frowned. Her small face was somewhat fierce as she asked.\"My name is Yu Qi. I lost control of my carriage and almost hit you two. I'm deeply sorry,\" the white-robed youth said with a face full of smiles.\"We're all right. Get out of the way,\" Liu Le 'er said with a taut face.\"Today's matter is all thanks to this brother's help. If I don't repay him, I won't be able to feel at ease.This place is not far from Yu Prefecture. Would it be possible for the two of you to come to my residence and let me show my hospitality as a host? \"Yu Qi said slowly.\"There's no need. What happened just now was nothing. We siblings still have other matters to attend to,\" Le 'er shook her head without hesitation. She pulled Liu Shi and was about to walk away from the person in front of them.\"Wait. This so-called important matter \u2026 Could it be that you want to seek medical treatment for Your Elder Brother?\"Yu Qi's figure flashed and appeared in front of the two of them. She looked at the tall Youth and suddenly asked with a serious expression.\"You \u2026 How did you know about this?\" Le 'er was startled. She couldn't help but reveal a shocked expression.\"I was born with a very sensitive nose. You two have the smell of herbs on your bodies. You should have just come from the nearby Nokikusai.Although this brother's divine strength is astonishing, it seems that his divine intellect is hindered. That's why I guessed so. It seems that I'm right. \"Yu Qi looked at Wild Chrysanthemum, who was not far away, and smiled. Although she was dressed as a man, there was a strange charm to her smile.Even though Le 'er was a woman who looked even younger, she was stunned. She immediately turned to look at Liu Shi and saw that her \"Brother Stone\" was still expressionless. She didn't know why, but she felt slightly relieved.At this time, the white-robed youth had already put away his \"breathtaking\" smile.He continued, \"Little sister, our Yu Family has some influence in Mingyuan City. We know many famous doctors. If you seek medical treatment, they should be able to help.\"\"That's right. We came to Mingyuan City to seek medical treatment. However, ordinary doctors can't cure my brother's illness.\" Liu Le 'er shook her head.\"In that case, it seems that Your Elder Brother's illness isn't ordinary.However, it doesn't matter. Our Yu Family has an Immortal Honored Guest. His medical skills are far superior to those of ordinary doctors. Why don't we ask him to take a look at Your Elder Brother? \"Yu Qi frowned, but after glancing at Liu Shi and Le 'er, she clapped her hands and smiled.\"Immortal Honored Guest \u2026\" Liu Le 'er's eyes brightened, but she hesitated.\"Little sister Your Elder Brother, please don't decline. Let me do what I can.I'm not boasting, but although there are other Immortal Honored Guests in Mingyuan City, in terms of medical skills, if our Yu Prefecture's Immortal Honored Guest claims to be number two, then no one would dare claim to be number one. \"Yu Qi's eyes turned slightly before she proudly spoke.\"Alright, the two of us can go with you.However, if this Immortal Honored Guest isn't able to cure my elder brother, we will have to leave immediately. \"Liu Le 'er was finally moved by the white-robed youth's final words and reluctantly agreed.When Yu Qi saw that Liu Le 'er had agreed, she was delighted and immediately asked, \"Of course. That's right, I still haven't asked for your names.\"Liu Le 'er hesitated for a moment before reporting her and Liu Shi's names.\"So it's Little Sister Le 'er and Brother Liu Shi.\" Yu Qi nodded repeatedly.The Confucian robed Youth had been left to the side for a long time and his expression wasn't too good. At that moment, he couldn't help but interject, \"Seventh Brother, these two people are of unknown origin. How can you just casually bring them home and ask an Enlightened Master to treat them?\"\"It doesn't matter. I know what I'm doing. Second Brother doesn't need to worry.\" Yu Qi waved her hand and casually replied.The Confucian robed Youth seemed to be somewhat afraid of his younger brother, Yu Qi. His lips moved a few times as if he wanted to say something. However, he didn't say anything in the end.At that moment, a few brightly dressed guards carrying swords and sabers hurriedly rushed over from a distance.When the nearby onlookers saw this, they abruptly dispersed. It seemed that they were very afraid of these people.The guards didn't pay attention to the surrounding people. They hastily stepped forward and bowed to Yu Qi and Liu Le 'er.\"Seventh Young Master, Second Young Master, we've come late. Please forgive us.\"\"We're fine. There's no need to make a fuss.The few of you, take the carriage back first. Don't make this matter public. \"Yu Qi said lightly.\"Yes.\"The guards obediently took the strange green horse in a flurry and quickly left.\"The two of you, please follow me.\"After dealing with these things, the white-robed youth turned around and smiled at Liu Le 'er and Liu Le' er. Then, he took the lead and walked forward.Liu Le 'er glanced at Liu Shi again. She held his hand tightly and followed behind Yu Qi.The Confucian robed Youth watched them go away. His face became more and more gloomy. He stood still for a while, then stomped his feet and snorted coldly. Then, he strode forward.\u2026\"Haha, interesting!She's said to have a good aptitude for cultivation. She's the one that the Prime Minister of Toyokuni originally planned to send to the Leng Yan Sect. \"At an inconspicuous corner of the street not far away, two people suddenly turned around. The one in front was a Youth in black. His eyes were narrow and long. He looked at the direction where Yu Qi and the others had gone and said in a gloomy voice. His face was full of indescribable evil spirit.\"Be careful, Junior Brother. It's said that there are also Rogue Cultivators in Yu Prefecture. Moreover, they're not alone. Don't underestimate them.\"The other person behind the black-clothed youth was a grey-clothed man who was as thin as a stick. There were several bulging beast-skin pouches hanging from his waist. He was also looking at the back of the Yu Residence's people as he spoke slowly.\"Senior Brother Fan, I know what to do.But this time, Yu Prefecture is my first trial mission. You're only sent to assist me. If there's no special reason, you don't have to do anything.I'll take care of everything with my people. \"The Youth in black didn't take it seriously.Seeing this, the man in gray smiled bitterly and said nothing.He knew his Junior Brother's character very well. Although his cultivation was not high, he had the support of the Elders of the Sect. He had always looked down on the other Junior Brothers of the same level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe white-robed youth was quite talkative. Along the way, he told Liu Le'er some interesting anecdotes about the city. However, Liu Le'er was somewhat absent-minded and only responded with a few words.The group passed through several streets and soon arrived at the center of Mingyuan City.This place was somewhat quiet. The roads were clean and tidy, and there were no shops on either side. Instead, there were many large courtyards. It was obvious that these were the residences of the rich and powerful families in the city.After walking for a while, the group arrived outside a vermilion mansion.Unlike the other buildings in the city, this mansion occupied a large area. The vermilion gate was about six feet tall, and it looked majestic. Two stone lions stood in the courtyard, each of them about ten feet tall. The gate was covered with shiny copper nails that shone brightly under the sun.On each side of the gate, there was a guard dressed in bright armor. He wore the same clothes as the guards from before, but he held a spear in his hand and stood solemnly.Everything here showed the power and status of the owner of this place.A huge gilded plaque hung above the main gate, with the words' Yu Residence 'written on it in large gilded characters.Liu Shi raised his head and glanced at Yu Prefecture, but he quickly withdrew his gaze.Liu Le'er looked at the mansion in front of her in surprise. She felt slightly uneasy.She had never seen such a large mansion before. From the condition of the gate, it seemed that Yu Prefecture had a very high status in Mingyuan City. It was likely that it was closely related to the Toyokuni Imperial Court.\"Younger Sister Liu, what's wrong?\" The white-robed youth seemed to have noticed something and asked gently.\"Yu Prefecture is so big, and there are so many guards. It can't be an ordinary family, right?\" Liu Le'er said with a forced smile.\"Younger Sister Liu is really smart. My father is the Prime Minister of Toyokuni. That's why there are guards in the mansion. Otherwise, how could a true Immortal Master be stationed here?\" Yu Qi replied disapprovingly.Liu Le'er couldn't help but widen her eyes when she heard this.When the Youth saw this, his face was filled with arrogance.\"Seventh Young Master, Second Young Master!\" Upon seeing them, the two guards at the entrance hurriedly greeted them and bowed.Yu Qi nodded slightly at the two of them and led Liu Le'er and Liu Yue through the door.\"Seventh Brother, if you insist on bringing two outsiders into the mansion, be careful. Father will be furious if he finds out. Don't blame me for not reminding you.\" After entering Yu Prefecture, the Youth in the Confucian robe snorted coldly and left in a huff.\"Ignore him. Please follow me.\" Yu Qi smiled sweetly and led Liu Le'er and Liu Shi to another direction in the mansion.Yu Prefecture covered a large area. There were pavilions, terraces, pavilions, gardens, and corridors everywhere.The floor was also paved with white jade, green jade, and other high-quality jade stones. It was as smooth as a mirror and as hard as iron, showing off the extravagance of a wealthy family.Yu Qi seemed to be very dignified in Yu Prefecture. The servants they met along the way all saluted her, and some even directly knelt on one knee.When Liu Le'er saw this, she glanced at Yu Qi's back. Her two sparkling eyes rolled around, and no one knew what she was thinking.When she and Liu Shi followed behind Yu Qi, they naturally attracted many people's attention. In particular, Liu Shi's strange behavior was even more eye-catching. However, these people seemed to be afraid of Yu Qi's dignity and didn't dare to stare.Not long after, the three of them arrived at a long corridor. A tall servant girl wearing a long green dress walked over.\"Young Master, you're back.\" When the servant girl saw Yu Qi, she immediately revealed a happy smile and trotted over.\"Xiao Wu, there are honored guests here. Don't be disrespectful.\" Yu Qi reprimanded in a deep voice.The servant girl Xiao Wu stuck out her tongue, but she wasn't afraid. She was completely different from the previous servants.Yu Qi helplessly glared at the servant girl, and then said: \"Xiao Wu, you came at the right time. These two are my honored guests. Younger Sister Liu Le'er and Brother Liu Shi, go to the west wing and clean up a courtyard for them to rest.\"At this moment, Xiao Wu noticed the two people behind Yu Qi. Liu Shi's strange behavior surprised her, but when her eyes fell on Liu Le'er, her beautiful eyes suddenly lit up. She smiled and said: \"Ah, such a beautiful little sister!\"\"Younger Sister Liu is my honored guest. Don't be rude!Both of you, Xiao Wu is my personal servant girl. Please don't blame her for her rude words. \"Yu Qi reprimanded, and then turned to Liu Le'er and Liu Shi with an apologetic smile.\"I know.\" Xiao Wu said, but when Yu Qi didn't notice, she made a face at Le'er.Liu Le'er was amused and couldn't help but laugh. She quickly covered her mouth with her hand, but her originally nervous mood relaxed a little.\"Right, I've been outside for a few days, in the mansion \u2026\" Yu Qi looked around, and then approached Xiao Wu and whispered.The two bodies leaned against each other, and their expressions were intimate. Xiao Wu didn't seem to avoid it.Seeing this scene, Liu Le'er curled her lips, and the little good impression she had of the white-robed youth was greatly reduced.The two whispered a few words, and then Xiao Wu nodded. She turned around and walked away quickly.\"Both of you, please.\" Yu Qi said, and continued to walk.After a while, the three of them arrived at a small courtyard. Xiao Wu was there to welcome them.Although it was a small courtyard, the area was not small. There was a small path paved with cobblestones. There was a pine tree on the left, and a cluster of dark green bamboo on the right.A breeze blew, and the leaves of the pine tree rustled. It was incomparably quiet.Although the furnishings in the house were simple, the workmanship of the tables, chairs, and benches was extremely exquisite.The tables and chairs were clean and spotless. It was obvious that they had just been cleaned.\"Both of you look a little tired. Please rest here for a while. Later, I will host a banquet to entertain Your Elder Brother Younger Sister.\" The white-robed youth turned to look at Liu Le'er, and said with a smile.\"There's no need to entertain.I only want to know when I can ask that Immortal Master to treat my elder brother's illness. \"Liu Le'er looked around.\"Since both of you don't like to entertain, I will ask Xiao Wu to send dinner over later.As for the Immortal Master, I'm afraid you will have to wait until tomorrow. \"Yu Qi pondered for a moment, and said.\"Alright.\" Liu Le'er was somewhat disappointed.\"Oh, that's right. If both of you need anything else, you can ask Xiao Wu.Both of you rest well. I will take my leave first. \"Yu Qi said, and looked at Liu Shi.Liu Le'er nodded, and her expression was somewhat absent-minded.\u2026\"Young Master, who are they?Looking at their clothes, they are just ordinary people. Why are you so polite to them? \"Outside the small courtyard, Xiao Wu asked curiously.\"Little girl, what do you know?Today, my second brother's and my carriage was startled. It was that Liu Shi who single-handedly subdued the Green Wind Horse, and stopped the carriage. \"Yu Qi frivolously pinched Xiao Wu's white chin, and said with a light smile.\"Green Wind Horse!Single-handedly!That Liu Shi \u2026 has great strength! \"Xiao Wu was startled when she heard this.\"Do you understand now? If I can subdue this kind of mutant with divine strength, he will be very useful to me in the future.Moreover, even if Le'er is older, she will still be a great beauty that can cause the downfall of a city. How can I bear to let her wander about outside and suffer hardships? Naturally, I will also take her into the residence.Pass down the order that we must properly entertain them. Don't neglect them. \"The white-robed youngster walked out with a smile on his face, and gave his orders as he walked.\"Yes.\" It was unknown what Xiao Wu had thought of, but her face blushed as she hastily complied.\u2026Inside the small courtyard.Liu Le'er had traveled the entire day, and she had just experienced a storm. She was somewhat tired, and so she pulled Liu Shi into the bedroom to rest.Although they were men and women, the two of them had been living and eating together in the wilderness for the past few years. So, Liu Le'er didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it.When the sky turned dark, Xiao Wu brought a sumptuous dinner.Looking at the table full of fragrant dishes, Liu Le'er couldn't help but swallow her saliva.She had never eaten such sumptuous food before. Although she was in the Prime Minister's residence, and the unfamiliar environment made her somewhat restless, she couldn't help but eat heartily.On the contrary, Liu Shi didn't have any reaction to these delicious dishes.The night gradually deepened, and a full moon slowly rose from the horizon.Liu Le'er was lying on the bed. She tossed and turned for a long time, but she couldn't fall asleep. Her mind was filled with the matter of tomorrow's treatment.\"Brother Stone, do you think that Immortal Teacher can cure you?\" Liu Le'er moved her body a bit closer to the bed, and softly said.Liu Shi didn't lie down. He closed his eyes and sat cross-legged on the bed.He had done this every night for the past few years, and he had never laid down to sleep.Liu Shi was expressionless, and he didn't open his eyes either. It was as if he hadn't heard the young girl's words.\"Brother Stone, don't worry. If the Immortal Teacher here can't cure you, we'll go somewhere else. There will certainly be someone who can cure you.\"Liu Le'er was accustomed to this. She whispered a few more words, and then revealed a relieved smile. She slowly closed her eyes, and entered into a dream.Liu Shi remained motionless, like a statue in the darkness.After an unknown amount of time, the tall Youth suddenly opened his eyes, and looked in a certain direction in Yu Prefecture. He subconsciously raised his hand, and stroked a dark green ornament on his neck.\u2026At the same time, in the direction that the tall Youth was looking at, in a secret underground room in Yu Prefecture.The four walls of the secret room were engraved with dark-red runes, and they converged from various parts of the wall to the center.A black alchemy furnace was placed in the center of the secret room. At the bottom of the furnace was a fire pool, burning with raging flames.The alchemy furnace was emitting a black light, and its lid was trembling slightly, as if it would fly away at any time.An old man stood next to the alchemy furnace, and nervously looked at it.This man wore a lotus crown on his head, and wore a grey-white Daoist robe. His eyes were deep, and his cheeks were thin. A long goat-like beard hung from his chin, and his hair was snow-white. He seemed to be in his seventies, and had the air of an immortal.At this moment, a muffled explosion came from the alchemy furnace, and a burning smell spread out.I's complexion changed. He waved his hand, and cast a magic art to extinguish the fire in the furnace. Then, he waved his hand, and the lid of the alchemy furnace flew up.He didn't care about the scalding heat of the alchemy furnace, and put his hand inside. His complexion became extremely gloomy, and he took out a handful of black powder.A strong medicinal fragrance mixed with a burnt smell was emitted from the powder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the morning of the second day, the sound of footsteps could be heard from outside the west wing of Yu Prefecture.In the vermilion corridor that led to the courtyard, three people were slowly walking in this direction.The two people in front were walking side by side. One was the aged I, who wore a lotus crown and a grey Daoist robe. The other was a heroic-looking woman in a light yellow palace dress.Behind the two people, there was a young girl dressed in a servant girl's dress. In her hand, she carried a three-layered food box made of fragrant wood and vermilion lacquer.I walked with his hands behind his back. His white eyebrows were slightly furrowed, and his expression seemed somewhat displeased. His gaze was straight ahead, but his mind was clearly elsewhere.The woman in the palace dress was not very old, around seventeen or eighteen years old. Although her figure had not fully developed, it looked extremely well-proportioned. Her black hair was tied up high, her facial features were elegant, and her eyebrows were full of heroic spirit. Her eyes were as bright as stars, causing one to forget about worldly affairs.In addition, the woman's face was slightly powdered, causing her originally white and flawless cheeks to have an appropriate blush, making her appear especially lovely.\"Bai Shi Zhenren, I am truly sorry to disturb your pill refining.\" The woman said as she walked, her eyebrows slightly drooping.\"There is no harm in taking a look. However, I is a bit puzzled. Why does Miss Seven want I to treat a foolish mortal?\" Hearing this, I withdrew his thoughts, his face still expressionless.\"You may not know, but yesterday, this person \u2026\"The woman in the palace dress smiled faintly and roughly recounted how Liu Shi had stopped a horse to save a person on the street yesterday.As I listened, he gently rubbed his fingers. When he heard that Liu Shi had only used one hand to stop the Azure Wind Horse that was charging madly, his white eyebrows slightly raised.\"Since he is indebted to Miss Seven, then this person is worthy of I's attention.\" Hearing this, I loosened his lightly rubbing index finger and thumb and said indifferently.Hearing this, the woman in the palace dress smiled and slightly bowed.The maidservant nervously carried the food box and obediently followed behind the two of them, not making a single sound.In the west wing, Liu Le'er, who had already washed up and dressed, was talking to Liu Shi, who was sitting on the edge of the bed. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.\"Little Sister Le'Er, my Young Mistress has brought Master Immortal to visit you.\"The maidservant on the side did not wait for the Miss's signal. She immediately walked forward and lightly knocked on the door a few times, calling out in a low voice.Liu Le'er stood up and didn't rush to open the door. She asked with some doubt, \"Who is your Miss?\"\"Little sister Le 'er, it's me.\"Hearing the familiar voice coming from outside the door, Liu Le'er blinked in confusion.After a slight hesitation, she still walked forward and opened the door with a creak.As soon as the door was opened, she smelled a faint smell of medicine. Then, she saw three people standing outside the door.Her gaze first swept over I and confirmed that the smell of medicine came from him. Then, she looked at the maidservant on the side and found that she was the personal maidservant of Young Master Yu Qi, Xiao Wu.When Liu Le'er's gaze finally fell on the woman in the yellow palace dress who had a faint smile on her face, she was startled at first, and then her mouth opened wide in shock.\"You are \u2026 Seventh Young Master!\" Liu Le'er shouted with her hand covering her mouth.\"That's me.Little sister Le'er can call me Miss Seven or Elder Sister Seven. \"The woman in the palace dress looked at the young girl's astonished expression and said with a smile.\"No wonder yesterday, I felt that Seventh Young Master was a little \u2026\" Hearing this, Liu Le'er also smiled.\"A little what?\" Yu Qi slightly raised her eyebrows.\"A little \u2026 not like a man.\" Liu Le'er thought for a while and found this euphemistic way of saying it.\"A man can avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble when he walks outside.After a few years, when you grow up, Le'er, you will understand. \"The woman in the palace dress looked at Liu Le'er's pretty little face and said with a smile.Hearing this, Liu Le'er nodded, not fully understanding, and let the three people into the room.\"Little sister Le'er, this is the Immortal Master I told you about, Bai Shi Zhenren.Enlightened Master, this is Liu Le'er, and the one sitting over there is her brother, Liu Shi. \"Miss Seven slightly moved to the side, making way for I.\"Greetings, Immortal Master.\"Liu Le'er already had some guesses in her heart, but hearing this, her heart still thumped. She hurriedly lowered her head and bowed, not daring to look at I.Liu Shi sat on the edge of the bed and stared blankly at the people who came in.Bai Shi Zhenren indifferently glanced at Liu Le'er, then shifted his gaze to Liu Shi. He first walked to the front, then went around to the other side, and carefully looked from top to bottom. Finally, his gaze slightly focused on the space between Liu Shi's eyebrows.After looking for a moment, I closed his eyes, raised his palm, and suddenly pointed at the space between Liu Shi's eyebrows with two fingers.\"Ah \u2026\"Seeing this, Le'er was startled and couldn't help but cry out in alarm.I's outstretched fingers suddenly stiffened. He turned around and glanced at her with a displeased expression.\"Little Sister Le'er, Enlightened Master is helping your brother examine, no need to make a fuss.\" Miss Seven hurriedly pulled Liu Le'er and explained.\"I'm sorry, Immortal Master, I didn't mean to \u2026\" Liu Le'er knew she was in the wrong and quickly apologized.Hearing this, I's expression slightly relaxed. He raised his palm again, closed his eyes, and pointed at the space between Liu Shi's eyebrows.Following the two fingers pointing forward, a green light shone from the space between Liu Shi's eyebrows, and circular ripples swayed from it, like the ripples created when a stone was thrown into a lake.After a moment, I lightly exclaimed, withdrew his fingers, and slowly opened his eyes.\"How is it?Can Brother Stone be cured? \"Liu Le'er hurriedly asked.Bai Shi Zhenren glanced at her from the corner of his eyes, but didn't say anything.Yu Qi stepped forward, pulled Liu Le'er's hand, and lightly patted the back of her hand, indicating that she shouldn't be anxious.Liu Le'er shut her mouth and didn't ask any more questions, but her eyes were fixed on Liu Shi.As if sensing Liu Le'er's gaze, Liu Shi's eyes shifted to her, and he swallowed the pastry in his mouth. His mouth drew back, revealing a trace of a smile.Bai Shi Zhenren muttered to himself for a moment, and with a flip of his palm, an ancient bronze round mirror appeared out of thin air.\"Go!\"He lightly shouted, and the round mirror flashed with a green light. Immediately, it leisurely floated up, flew to the top of Liu Shi's head, and hovered motionlessly.Bai Shi Zhenren softly chanted, and his joined fingers also drew in the air, as if he was writing some kind of hidden runes.After a moment, both of his fingers suddenly stopped, and pointed at the round mirror from afar.The floating round mirror immediately shook violently, and the originally somewhat uneven mirror surface lit up with a layer of misty green light, and unexpectedly became bright and clean.Liu Le'er nervously stared at the mirror, and felt that there seemed to be some changes in the green light, as if some vague picture was about to appear.However, after waiting for a moment, the mirror's green light was still blurry, and nothing could be seen clearly.At this time, Liu Shi also seemed to be a little unhappy with the round mirror covering his head. He raised his hand, and waved it like he was driving away mosquitoes. Although he didn't sweep the round mirror, the green light on the mirror's surface swayed, and became more chaotic.\"Impossible, this is \u2026\"Seeing this, Reverend White Stone's countenance changed greatly. Immediately he shook his sleeve and waved it toward the ancient mirror. The round mirror immediately flew back like a swallow returning to its nest, submerged into his hand, and disappeared without a trace.Liu Le'er looked at this scene, and her small face immediately revealed an expression of concern.\"Did Daoist see the problem? Is there a way to cure it?\" Miss Seven couldn't help but ask.\"Fifty-fifty, it may not be impossible, but \u2026\" Bai Shi Zhenren's complexion was uncertain, and he looked somewhat hesitant.\"I beg Master Immortal to definitely cure my brother.\" Liu Le'er was overjoyed, and quickly begged.\"If Daoist has a good method, then please be sure to cure Liu Shi. As for any costs, I will bear them.\" Miss Seven also opened her mouth to speak.Hearing this, Liu Le'er looked at Yu Qi with a trace of gratitude in her eyes.\"Since Miss Seven has spoken, I will naturally do my best.However, I have to say that his soul is in a sealed state for some unknown reason, and it will not be easy to reopen it.Only by setting up a Spirit Summoning Spell Formation will there be a chance of a cure. It will also require Master I to be alone in a quiet room, and use all of his strength. \"Bai Shi Zhenren looked at the tall Youth for a long time, and then slowly replied as if he had made up his mind.\"Then when Master Immortal is treating him, can Le'er accompany him?\" Liu Le'er hesitated for a while, and then asked in a low voice.\"What are you accompanying him for?You're a hindrance.What's wrong? You, a little baby, don't believe this Old Taoist? \"Reverend White Stone suddenly raised his voice as he asked.Liu Le'er's heart thumped, and she quickly waved her hand. \"I don't dare, I don't dare. Le'er only wants to accompany Elder Brother, and will just watch from the side. I guarantee that I won't disturb Master Immortal.\"\"Up to you.The Spirit Summoning Spell Formation is not ordinary, and there are still some preparations that need to be done. I will go back first. \"Bai Shi Zhenren first said lightly, and then looked at Yu Qi with a serious expression.\"Thank you, Daoist.\" Miss Seven bowed.Liu Le'er also quickly bowed to Bai Shi Zhenren. However, before she could straighten up, I had already left the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the afternoon of the third day.The maidservant Xiao Wu came to the west room and informed Liu Le'er that Bai Shi Zhenren was ready to treat Liu Shi.Under the guidance of Xiao Wu, Liu Le'er led Liu Shi through a winding corridor, through four courtyards, and out of a circular arched door. Finally, they arrived at the backyard of Yu Prefecture.Liu Le 'er was already amazed by the twists and turns of the courtyard corridor, but when she saw the small lake full of dark green lotus leaves in the backyard, she finally had a real understanding of the vastness of the Yu's mansion.Although it was called a small lake, it was only compared to the big rivers that Liu Le'er had seen before. In fact, this lake had a circumference of at least three or four hundred feet. Compared to the ponds in the houses of ordinary rich people, the difference was like the clouds and mud.\"Miss Le'er, that is the place where Bai Shi Zhenren practices alchemy.\" Xiao Wu raised her hand and pointed to a small island in the middle of the lake.Liu Le'er followed the direction of Xiao Wu's finger and saw a stone bridge made of white marble with nine bends, passing through the lotus leaves and connecting to the small island.The area of the small island was not large, but it was densely forested and covered with clouds and mist, making it hard to see clearly.At the thought that there was a chance that her \"Brother Stone\" could be cured on the island, her small face could not hide the excitement, and her mind was also fluctuating.\"The place where a Daoist Master practices is not a place that we servants can go.Miss Le'er, you can go by yourselves. \"Xiao Wu saw that Liu Le'er was a little absent-minded, and said with a smile.\"Thank you, Elder Sister Xiao Wu.\" Liu Le'er came back to her senses and quickly thanked her.Liu Le'er's sweet \"sister\" made Xiao Wu very happy. She waved her hand happily, turned around, and walked away.The girl looked at the misty island in the middle of the lake. She held the railing of the stone bridge with one hand and did not rush to get on the bridge. For some reason, a thought suddenly popped up in her mind.\"If Brother Stone recovers, will he leave Le'Er?\"Thinking of this, she could not help but feel a little worried. However, when she looked at the tall Youth's unusually familiar face again, she suddenly felt relieved.\"Brother Stone, let's go.\"The girl took the lead and stepped onto the stone bridge. She held Liu Shi's hand and walked towards the small island.Passing through the green leaves of the stone bridge, Liu Le'er couldn't help but feel a little nervous. Liu Shi, on the other hand, had a calm expression. From time to time, he would be attracted by the koi fish under the lotus leaves, looking left and right.When they arrived at the edge of the small island, Liu Le'er felt that the mist on the island was not as thick as it looked from afar. There were not many birds chirping around, and it was particularly quiet and serene.At the end of the stone bridge, there was a bluestone paved path, all the way winding all the way to the depths of the small island.Liu Le'er and Shi Mu walked along the path all the way, without any forks in the road, and directly arrived in front of a simple Taoist temple with white walls and black tiles.Bai Shi Zhenren was standing in front of the Taoist temple, waiting. When he saw the two of them, he expressionlessly said, \"Come in.\" Then he turned around and walked in the direction of the back hall of the Taoist temple.The two of them followed I through three main halls, and arrived at the back of the Taoist temple, where there was a huge artificial mountain.Bai Shi Zhenren walked in front of a certain mountain wall, and raised his hand to press on it. A heavy stone door slowly opened, revealing a cave entrance that was as tall as a person.After the two of them followed I into the cave, the heavy stone door behind them slowly closed.The cave was man-made, and the space inside was not very large, only slightly larger than the space of the west room where they lived. There were a few lamps on the four walls, and they didn't know what kind of lamp oil they were burning, but there was no smoke.An octagonal pattern was carved in the center of the ground, and it looked like the Eight Trigrams, but it was obviously different.The carvings on the pattern were very deep, and there were not only some strange patterns of birds and beasts, but also some strange lines. She vaguely felt that she had seen them before, and they seemed to be some kind of ancient seal script.On each corner of the octagonal pattern, there was a dark red triangular flag, and there were also some strange patterns drawn on the flag with golden lines.\"What are you waiting for? Let him sit in the middle of the magic circle,\" Bai Shi Zhenren glanced at Liu Le 'er, who was looking at the magic circle, and said coldly.\"Yes.\"Liu Le 'er quickly withdrew her gaze, and led the tall Youth to sit in the middle of the circle pattern in the middle of the magic circle.\"Brother Stone, you will definitely get better. Le 'er will be here to accompany you.\"Liu Le 'er stared into Liu Shi's eyes, and said seriously. Then, she reluctantly left the magic circle, and stood at the side of the stone wall, and looked at I with a nervous expression.\"Now, you will stay where you are, and don't make a sound, and don't disturb I when he is casting the magic. Don't even take half a step, understand?\" Bai Shi Zhenren ordered solemnly.Liu Le 'er quickly nodded.Only then did Bai Shi Zhenren walk forward. First, he raised his palm and bowed. Then, he walked around the magic circle, and silently chanted an obscure incantation.As he chanted, the golden lines on the eight triangular flags around the formation lit up at the same time with a dazzling golden light. They spread from all directions and covered Liu Shi's body.Liu Shi was originally looking around, but the moment the golden light covered his body, his body suddenly shook, and he sat up straight as if he had been electrocuted.Seeing this, Liu Le 'er's heart skipped a beat. She was a little worried, but also a little expectant.Golden light flowed around Liu Shi's body, and vaguely began to condense into strange golden patterns. At the same time, there seemed to be spots of golden light gathering in his eyes, and he looked even more strange.Spiritual Master White Stone's chanting suddenly stopped. His hand gesture that was forming the incantation sign suddenly changed. He clasped his fingers and shouted,\"Suppress!\"The golden light that was swimming around Liu Shi's body suddenly condensed, and like a layer of golden paper, it wrapped him up.Through the golden light, Liu Shi's face could be seen. He frowned, and he seemed to be in pain.A loud sizzling sound could be heard!The eight small flags around the magic circle shone with red light, and streams of black-gray fog flowed out and gathered in the center of the magic circle.When Liu Le 'er saw this, her expression changed slightly. She did not know why, but the moment the black-gray fog appeared, she instinctively felt extremely uncomfortable.Suddenly, Liu Shi groaned, and the muscles on his face twitched.\"Ah!\"Liu Le 'er could not help but exclaim, but she immediately covered her almond-shaped mouth with her jade-like hands, her face pale.\"Shut up!If you interfere with I's casting, can you bear the consequences? \"Bai Shi Zhenren's fingers were still clasped tightly, and he scolded sternly.Liu Le 'er's heart trembled, and she did not dare to speak anymore, but the panic in her eyes did not fade away.The fog was like a living thing, and it intertwined into tentacles, wantonly climbing up, and directly swallowed Liu Shi.Then, I made a gesture with one hand, and a gloomy incantation sounded.The black-gray fog became thicker and thicker.The tall Youth in the fog first showed a confused expression, and then his eyelids drooped, and he slowly closed his eyes. He actually fell asleep standing up.I saw this, and his face revealed a trace of joy. He suddenly changed his hand gesture, opened his mouth, and spat out a ball of blood essence, which turned into spots of blood light, and directly entered the black-gray fog.Suddenly, there was a thick smell of blood in the fog, and blood-colored runes appeared in a frenzy.\"Something is wrong!\"When Liu Le 'er saw this, her expression changed several times. Her intuition strongly told her that the situation was not right, but because of the previous warning, the girl was a little hesitant.But at this moment, I let out a low shout.The black-gray fog's temperature suddenly dropped, and it turned into a huge black ice cube in the crystal light. The tall Youth was frozen in the middle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWithout waiting for the young girl to shake the artifact in her hand, I shook his sleeves and spat out the word \"Quick\".A streak of golden light shot forth like lightning, transforming into a shimmering golden rope in a flash, binding the young woman in a firm manner.\"Plop!\"Liu Le 'er lost her balance and immediately fell over.\"Old thief, what are you trying to do?\"The young girl glared fiercely at Perfected Yu Shi, her body twisting incessantly. However, the golden rope seemed to have sensed her resistance and abruptly tightened with a flash of golden light on its surface.\"Ugh \u2026\"The young girl's face contorted in pain and tears flowed from her beautiful eyes. However, she gritted her teeth and didn't scream.At this moment, the ears on both sides of her cheeks suddenly disappeared and two pointy, triangular fox ears emerged from the black hair on both sides of her head.A powerful restraining force came from the golden rope and completely sealed the transcendence energy in her body.\"Hehe, what are you doing?You little fox demon, you think you can hide from me with just a single artifact? You're really delusional! \"Bai Shi Zhenren glanced at the young girl on the ground and said coldly.\"You've already seen through my identity!\" The young girl's heart sank, but she still wore a stubborn expression that didn't match her heart.\"Hehe, do you still need to care about this now?You were brought into the residence by Miss Seven. The fox clan is considered quite powerful in the Spirit Huan Domain's demon clan, so I originally planned to turn a blind eye and let you off.However, who would've thought that I'd find this human-shaped treasure. \"After Bai Shi Zhenren said a few words indifferently, he turned to look at Liu Shi who was inside the black ice block. His eyes revealed a trace of uncontrollable fire.\"You \u2026 What do you want to do to Brother Stone?\" Liu Le 'er asked with a trembling voice when she saw Bai Shi's expression.\"Don't worry, I can't bear to kill your silly brother. He has a naturally powerful soul that's rarely seen in a hundred years. What's even more amazing is that his consciousness was injured and he became stupid.As long as this Daoist grandpa uses a secret technique to refine it and erase its remnant consciousness, I will be able to refine a soul puppet with boundless potential. \"Daoist White Stone half explained and half muttered to himself, his face full of pride.After Liu Le 'er heard this, a trace of blood flowed out from the corner of her mouth. Her eyes suddenly revealed a trace of madness and a strange layer of blood red appeared on her face. Her body suddenly arched and she let out a beastly roar. Her pupils suddenly lit up with a green light and large patches of white fur grew all over her body.Every single strand of his fur was sparkling with a translucent radiance, and they were extremely hard. His entire body seemed to have become a white hedgehog, and the white fur on his tail was faintly flickering with white arcs of electricity.The white fox's fur suddenly stood erect, and the golden rope was pushed open by a few centimeters. Its furry tail trembled, and white light shone brightly.Xiu Xiu Xiu!Countless white hairs shot out like thousands of flying needles. They issued an ear-piercing sound and hit the black ice block.\"You're courting death!\"Bai Shi Zhenren suddenly turned around and shouted in anger. He waved his hand and a black oval shield appeared in front of him. Then, it turned into a black light and flew out at an extremely fast speed. It flew ahead of the white fox fur and reached the black ice block.The oval shield suddenly expanded several times in size, blocking the black ice block behind it.\"Peng Peng Peng\" a series of loud sounds were heard!The white hairs hit the black shield. The black shield trembled and blocked all the hairs.The green light in Liu Le 'er's eyes flickered violently when she saw this. She was about to make another move when the golden rope on her body suddenly shone brightly. Its strength suddenly doubled and it quickly squirmed and shrank. It crushed the white fox fur and a golden light flashed on the surface of the rope. Then, countless finger-long sharp golden needles grew out of the rope and pierced deep into her body.\"Ah!\"In an instant, blood gushed out of the girl's body and dyed a large patch of the fox fur red.However, she gritted her teeth and used all her strength to swing her tail again, ignoring the blood flowing out of her body. Whoosh!Whoosh! Whoosh!Another wave of white hairs shot out.This time, the hairs scattered like flowers scattered by a celestial maiden, hitting the black ice from all directions.Although the black shield's defense was amazing, it was helpless against the hair coming from all directions.\"Evildoer, how dare you!\"Bai Shi Zhenren was furious. He opened his mouth and spat out a black light. It was a snake-shaped flying sword wrapped in black light. In a flash, it flew above the black ice block.Buzz!The flying sword circled in the air and transformed into a black sword qi. It formed a sword shadow and wrapped around the black ice block.The black shield also shone brightly and increased in size again. Together with the sword shadow, it protected the ice block.Ding! Ding! Ding! A series of metal clashing sounds rang out.Most of the hair was blocked by the flying sword and the shield. However, there were still some that penetrated the sword shadow and hit the black ice block.The black ice block shook violently and many small holes appeared on its surface. A few cracks appeared and quickly spread.At this moment, a figure flashed and Bai Shi Zhenren appeared beside the ice block. He waved his hands and a large amount of black gas surged out from his sleeves. Some of it fused with the black ice block, while the rest condensed into a shield and wrapped around the black ice block.The cracks on the ice block immediately stopped spreading and quickly healed. In a few breaths, the ice block was back to its original state.Bai Shi Zhenren heaved a sigh of relief and turned to look at Liu Le'er angrily.The girl was lying on the ground, her eyes filled with indignation.All the white fox fur on her body had disappeared and her aura was weak. It was obvious that the two attacks just now had exhausted her Primordial Qi.\"I've really underestimated you!\"Bai Shi Zhenren snorted coldly. The Black Ice block would've been broken by Liu Le'er if he had been a little bit slower.Then, he waved his hand and a black palm of light appeared out of thin air and patted Liu Le'er's body.The girl's petite body was sent flying and crashed against the wall of the secret chamber. She screamed and spouted a mouthful of blood. Then, she fell to the ground.Her whole body was bathed in blood and her hair was disheveled. Her complexion was extremely pale. She seemed to be in a very bad condition.If it weren't for Bai Shi Zhenren's intention to sell her for spirit stones, she would've been dead by now.\"Brother Stone \u2026\" Liu Le'er raised her head and looked at Liu Shi in the ice block. She murmured in a low voice. Then, her body twitched and she fainted.When Bai Shi Zhenren saw this, he waved his hand and several talismans flew out and stuck to the ground around Liu Le'er's body.A large amount of black light burst out from the talismans and condensed into a ball of light that covered the girl.After doing this, I turned to look at the black ice block again and couldn't help but smile.\"Red-robed Master, Gui Yao, wait until I've refined my Soul Puppet. Then, let's see how you'll fight me!\"The smile on Bai Shi Zhenren's face disappeared and he raised his hands. Then, eight more talismans flew out and landed on the ground near the black ice block.Buzz!A large amount of black light rose from the eight talismans and formed a spell formation. The black ice block floated in the air and floated in the air.When I saw this, he turned his hand and took out a black gourd.The gourd was engraved with a circle of blue talisman characters. It emitted a cold light and the sound of surging liquid came from it.He opened the gourd's stopper and carefully tilted the gourd. A pitch-black liquid exuded a pungent rancid smell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBai Shi Zhenren's expression was solemn as he treated the black liquid with extreme caution. He waved his hand and a black light enveloped the liquid before landing on the black ice block.The moment the liquid touched the black ice block, it immediately seeped in. Soon, the originally black and translucent ice block turned jet-black. Even the Youth's figure within it became blurry and indistinct.I revealed a satisfied expression as he kept the gourd and sat down cross-legged.This liquid was the Black Corpse Soul Decaying Water that he had meticulously refined from over ten types of rare materials. It could seep into a cultivator's sea of consciousness and harm the soul. It was extremely insidious.Bai Shi Zhenren formed a hand seal with both hands and the black spots of light within the ice were immediately activated. A small portion of it began to slowly seep into Liu Shi's head.He planned to only use a little bit of the Soul Decaying Water at a time to gradually erase the consciousness of the tall Youth. This way, he could reduce the other party's instinctive resistance as much as possible to ensure that nothing would go wrong.Just as the few spots of light touched the Youth's head, they suddenly flashed and seeped into it.Not only that, all the black spots of light within the ice block began to stir and uncontrollably surged towards every part of the Youth's body and seeped into it.\"Not good!\"I's expression changed drastically as he frantically formed a hand seal in an attempt to control the black spots of light. However, it was too late.All the Black Corpse Soul Decaying Water disappeared in the blink of an eye. However, the body of the Youth sealed within the ice did not seem to have changed at all. It was as though nothing had happened.\"What's going on? Where's my Black Corpse Soul Decaying Water?\"Bai Shi Zhenren suddenly stood up with a face full of shock and anger. At the same time, he released his divine sense to probe Liu Shi's body.However, no matter how he probed, he could not find anything strange.The old man stared at Liu Shi and took a deep breath. The shock and anger on his face quickly disappeared and was replaced with a frown.\"This person does not have any trace of transcendence power. He is definitely not a cultivator!Could it be that he has consumed some spirit medicine or has some treasure to protect his body that is coincidentally able to restrain the Black Corpse Soul Decaying Water \u2026 \"His eyes involuntarily glanced at the chest area of the tall Youth. There was a slight bulge there, and a faint wisp of dark green light was flashing.I hesitated for a moment and gave up on the idea of removing the ice seal and searching their bodies. After all, once this array was activated, it could not be easily stopped.After he pondered for a moment, he turned his hand and took out a green gourd. He waved his hand and released a spell symbol. The mouth of the gourd flashed with green light, and a dozen dark green insects flew out of it.These bugs were about half a foot long and as thick as a strand of hair. As they flew through the air, they let out squeaking cries. As soon as they appeared, they transformed into beams of green light that pierced through the ice like spirits. Then, they pounced toward the top of the Youth's head in an attempt to burrow into it.A strange creaking sound came from the ice.No matter how hard these green insects tried, they could not burrow into the Youth's scalp at all.There seemed to be an invisible force in Liu Shi's head that prevented the green worms from entering.Bai Shi Zhenren's expression changed, and he finally became slightly bewildered.\"Humph!I don't believe that I can't deal with an idiot like you. \"He remained silent for a moment. Then, a tyrannical look appeared on his face.I waved his hand and recalled the green insects. He then put them into the gourd. Then, he clenched his teeth, and started to mumble something.A beam of grey light flew out of his body, and floated above his head. It was a small grey flag. It swelled several times in size in the wind.The small flag was densely covered with layers of restrictive charm characters. It was hard to tell how many layers of charm characters were engraved on it. It could dazzle a person's eyes at a glance. However, these charm characters were dim and lifeless.Bai Shi Zhenren bit the tip of his tongue, and spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, the blood seeped into the flag. Simultaneously, his hands moved at lightning speed, and a beam of black light seeped into the grey flag. The surface of the flag suddenly blossomed with a bright radiance. The charm characters on the surface of the flag began to brighten gradually. Then, a grey mist rose from its surface.The grey flag enlarged again with a \"Buzzing\" sound. It became ten feet in size. Then, a ray of light flashed on its surface. Then, the vague shadows of skeletons flew out of the flag. There were seven or eight of them. Each of them issued a heart-chilling wailing sound. Then, they pounced towards Liu Shi who was trapped in the Black Ice.The sound of the Night of a Hundred Ghosts reverberated in the secret room of the cave.Bai Shi Zhenren opened his bloodshot eyes wide, and stared at the shadows of the skeletons.Right at this moment, a shocking scene appeared.The shadows of the skeletons were about to plunge into the huge black ice. Suddenly, a strange ripple-like fluctuation appeared in the faint shadow of the tall Youth on the ground. Then, a black mass flew out of the shadow. It rotated in the air, and transformed into a ferocious-looking ghost's head. It had two horns on its head.The ghost's head was as big as a washbasin. It cackled in a strange manner. The green flames in its eyes flickered as it glanced at the shadows of the skeletons. Then, it opened its mouth, and spurted out a large amount of silver mist.\"Pu\" \"Pu\"It was as if the shadows of the skeletons had met their nemesis. They couldn't dodge the silver light. Instead, they were swept away by the silver light and swallowed by the ghost's head.After the sinister ghost's head had finished doing this, it smacked its mouth, which was full of fangs. It seemed as if it wanted to continue. Then, the green flames in its eyes flashed. It suddenly turned around, and spat out a large mass of green gas. Then, it disappeared into thin air.The green gas flashed and shot towards the Youth's face. Then, it silently disappeared into his body.All of this happened so quickly that Bai Shi Zhenren didn't even have time to react. It was already over.\"This \u2026\"I could be considered to be experienced and knowledgeable after forming his Gold Core. However, such a strange matter left him dumbstruck for a moment. He was at a loss as to what to do.At this moment, a crisp \"Crack\" sound was heard.White cracks suddenly appeared on the surface of the Black Ice. The tall Youth's eyelids moved, and he slowly opened his eyes.His eyes were astonishingly clear, and they were no longer at a loss like before.After his gaze swept around, he frowned slightly. Then, his shoulders shook slightly.\"Boom!\" A loud sound rang out!The entire piece of Black Ice exploded from the inside out. Grey-black ice fragments flew all over the sky and fell to the ground.The tall Youth raised his head and looked at I. His eyes flashed as if he wanted to say something. However, the next moment, his face suddenly revealed a trace of bewilderment. Then, he held his head with both hands and screamed loudly.The bones in his body made cracking sounds, and his hands and feet became thicker as if they were inflated. In the blink of an eye, his body expanded several times. Golden scales the size of copper coins appeared on the surface of his skin. This was also the case on his cheeks, neck, and other parts of his body.These scales seemed to be cast from pure gold. A dense cold light flowed through them, and they seemed indestructible.When Bai Shi Zhenren saw this scene, he was dumbstruck. Even if he had any other ideas, he knew that the situation was far from good. The situation had already gone out of his control.When he came back to his senses, his face immediately changed into a hideous expression. He clenched his teeth and spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood flashed and disappeared into the big grey banner.Rays of light appeared on the grey banner again. The runes on its surface squirmed as if they were alive. After a series of cracking sounds, they turned into a grey centipede that was fifty or sixty feet long.I patted the storage bag on his waist. Then, seven or eight fist-sized jet-black balls flew out. The surface of these balls was surrounded by black gas, and they emitted an incomparably foul smell. It was unknown what they were.However, the grey centipede let out a cheerful hiss. It opened its big mouth and swallowed the black balls. Immediately, a large amount of black appeared on the surface of its carapace and spread rapidly. In the blink of an eye, its entire body became as black as ink. Moreover, it was shining with a metallic luster. It seemed as if it was cast from black gold.The centipede let out an excited cry. Its pair of small eyes faintly glowed with red light. Its huge body moved slightly in the cave, and its long sickle-like legs scratched the mountain wall. The incomparably hard mountain wall was like tofu, and deep marks were left on it. At the same time, the surrounding stone wall was dyed black, and it emitted a pungent smell. It was obvious that the centipede's claws were highly poisonous.\"Go!Kill him! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe black centipede hissed, and its body swayed left and right. It turned into a black shadow and instantly pounced in front of Liu Shi. It opened its mouth wide, revealing a row of white dagger-like teeth. The teeth shone with a cold light and struck fear into Liu Shi's heart.The tall Youth was still holding his head and screaming, not noticing the situation around him at all. With a crack, he was bitten by the centipede.When Bai Shi Zhenren saw this, a cruel smile appeared on his face.He was well aware of how powerful this centipede was. It could crush ordinary magic tools with a single bite, and the most powerful part was the poison that covered its body, which could corrode spirituality and kill upon contact with blood.But in the next moment, the smile on I's face froze.The black centipede suddenly let out a scream and loosened its mouth, blood flowing out, and all of its sharp teeth were broken.On the golden scales on the tall Youth's shoulder, there was not a single scar left on it.Although the black centipede was severely injured, its ferocious nature was aroused. After letting out a blood-curling scream, its body suddenly coiled around the young man like a venomous snake. Its sharp legs took the opportunity to shake and slash at the young man.Clang clang!Sparks flew, but the scales on the Youth's body were still intact, and he was unscathed.When I saw this, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.\"Yes, I remember now \u2026 I \u2026 I am Han Li, the number one cultivator of the human race, the number one Mahayana Stage cultivator in the Spiritual Realm!\"The tall Youth suddenly stopped screaming, and he suddenly raised his head and roared. His eyes were extremely clear, and there was no longer a trace of confusion.He was Han Li, who had gone through untold hardships to ascend from the Spiritual Realm to the Immortal Realm.(For readers who haven't read Han Li's previous story, you can first read the related prequel, The Legend of a Mortal Cultivator.)Han Li didn't even look at the black centipede that was wrapped around his body. He moved his arm, and his palm directly penetrated the centipede's seemingly hard shell like a steel fork, and with a slight force, he easily tore the black centipede off his body.The black centipede hissed incessantly, and desperately twisted its huge body, but it couldn't break free at all.\"Peng!\"The Youth's fingers, which had sunk into the centipede's body, trembled, and an invisible force spread out.The black centipede let out a mournful wail, and its body slumped to the ground after the tremors. It no longer had any strength to struggle.Pfft!Han Li's other hand sank into the centipede's body. He exerted force with both hands at the same time, tearing the giant centipede in his hand into two pieces amidst the rain of blood and throwing it away casually.The two halves of the centipede's body twisted violently before reverting back into a pair of small flags. The spiritual light on their surfaces had completely faded, and it was clear that they had been completely destroyed.This series of actions happened in the blink of an eye.Bai Shi Zhenren stood there in a daze, his mouth slightly open, unable to close for a moment.Han Li turned to look at Bai Shi Zhenren.As soon as I met the cold gaze of the Youth, he quivered. His heart felt as if it had sunk into a bottomless ice cave, and his whole body felt extremely cold.\"Get trapped!\"Bai Shi Zhenren's complexion changed several times. Suddenly, he shouted loudly and formed a sign with both of his hands.The black magic circle in the secret room suddenly shone brightly, and a buzzing sound was heard. Streaks of black-grey fog frantically surged towards the tall Youth again.At the same time, I waved his sleeves, and a pale white flying shuttle flew out. It hovered in the air, and shot towards the door. He was actually trying to escape.\"You want to leave?!\"Han Li snorted coldly. The golden scales on one of his arms flashed wildly, and he punched the ground.\"Boom!\"The stone slabs on the ground splashed in all directions, and a huge pit appeared. The black magic circle disappeared without a trace, and all the fog was gone.Bai Shi Zhenren heard the sound of the magic circle shattering behind him, and his body trembled. However, at this moment, he had already flown to the side of the cave's door, and he was about to break it and escape.However, at this moment, a figure flashed in front of the stone door, and an explosive sound resounded in the air.\"Whoosh!\"I flew out like a sack in an instant, and he crashed into the stone wall not far away. A loud and muffled sound was heard.\"Wa!\"Bai Shi Zhenren opened his mouth, and spat out a mouthful of blood. He collapsed on the ground, and his face was full of fear. The flying shuttle under his feet had flown to an unknown place.Han Li stood upright at the door. He slowly withdrew his left fist, and his figure flashed. He appeared in front of Bai Shi Zhenren like a ghost, and looked at him coldly.\"Senior, please spare my life!I have eyes, but I didn't recognize Mount Tai. Please be magnanimous, and I am willing to offer all my belongings to you! \"Bai Shi Zhenren's body trembled, and he struggled to get up. He took off the storage bag from his waist, and put it in front of the Youth's feet with both of his hands. Then, he repeatedly kowtowed and begged for mercy.The tall Youth was expressionless, and he didn't even look at the storage bag.\"Apart from these, I still have some treasures in other places, and I can offer them all to you.\"I am a Guest of the Grand Chancellor's Mansion, and I also know the location of the Grand Chancellor's Mansion's Treasure House. As long as you nod, I will immediately take all of them and offer them to you. \"Bai Shi Taoist saw that the other party didn't say anything, and his heart thumped as he continued to beg.In order to survive, he couldn't care less.Han Li heard this, and his face revealed a trace of peculiarity. It seemed that he was somewhat moved by the other party's words, and the golden light on his body slowly converged.When the old Daoist saw this, he was overjoyed. Just as he was about to say something, Han Li suddenly raised his hand and grabbed at the air below him. A ball of black Qi flew out from his shadow and with a wave of his hand, it disappeared into the old Daoist's face.\"Senior, please spare my life!\"I was shocked, and he hurriedly checked the condition of his body. However, he didn't find any abnormalities, and this made him even more afraid.\"Don't worry, I won't kill you for the time being. This can be considered as giving you a taste of your own medicine. As long as I move my mind, this mass of black aura will immediately explode in your body. You should know what the consequences will be.In addition, I have already remembered everything. My surname is not Liu, but Han. \"Han Li said indifferently, and his originally huge body began to shrink back to normal. At the same time, the scales on the surface of his body also quickly faded away.Bai Shi Zhenren's face was ashen, but when he heard that Han Li wouldn't kill him immediately, his heart relaxed, and he repeatedly said yes.\"Bang\"Han Li then grabbed the old Daoist's collar and lifted him up. At the same time, his right index finger touched the space between the old Daoist's eyebrows. A black light shot out from his fingertip and entered the space between the old Daoist's eyebrows.\"Senior \u2026\" Bai Shi Zhenren was extremely frightened, and he thought that the other party was going to go back on his words. However, before he finished speaking, his eyes became blank.Han Li's lips were tightly pursed, and a layer of fine sweat gradually appeared on his forehead, and his face gradually turned pale.Time passed by for a moment.He let out a light breath, and his finger moved, and the black light on his fingertip dissipated.I's eyes rolled, and he directly fell into a coma.Han Li waved his hand, and Bai Shi Zhenren was thrown on the ground. He took a few deep breaths, and only then did his face recover, but then he knitted his brows, and his expression was uncertain.Just now, he had performed the soul-searching technique, and he had already found out what he wanted to know from Bai Shi Taoist.Han Li turned his eyes, and it fell on the body of Liu Le 'er who was also in a coma, and a trace of gentleness flashed across his eyes. Without the support of transcendence energy, the golden rope on her body had already loosened by itself, but it was still trapped in the black light cover.His figure flashed, and he appeared beside Liu Le 'er. He waved his hand, and a shapeless huge force suddenly burst out.The black light cover responded to the sound, and broke into pieces.Han Li looked at the girl's body that was riddled with wounds, and sighed. After a moment of hesitation, he made a gesture with one hand, and opened his mouth to spit out a thin cloud of green gas, which quickly merged into her body.Liu Le 'er's pale face immediately had a trace of redness, and the wounds on her body quickly recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.\"Little girl, these few years have been really hard on you.But in this way, I don't have much transcendence energy left. \"Han Li looked at the girl, and murmured. He then walked to the side of Bai Shi Zhenren, picked up the other's storage bag, and with a pull of both hands, it directly tore open, and a lot of things fell out.These things were mostly materials, but there were also some medicinal pills.Han Li carefully examined them, and then randomly picked out two bottles. He poured out a green medicinal pill and a red medicinal pill, and carefully fed them to Liu Le 'er.\u2026 \u2026The official WeChat account (wang--yu----) had already released a virtual dynamic 3D image of \"Han Li\".After replying to \"Quickly see Han Li\", an incredible scene immediately appeared!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li watched as Liu Le 'er's chest gradually calmed down, and her breathing gradually stabilized. Then, he sat down cross-legged again.He reached his hand into the clothes in front of his chest. After searching for a while, he took out the ornament that had been hanging on his neck. It was a slender round bottle with a light green body.The small bottle was distributed with dark green leaf-shaped patterns. They were vivid and very exquisite.Han Li gently rubbed the body of the bottle with his finger. He felt a familiar slightly protruding texture on his fingertips. His mind wandered.After pondering for a long time, his face suddenly sank. He put away the small bottle. At the same time, he said in a low voice, \"Magic Light.\"There was silence in the cave. There wasn't the slightest movement. Only Han Li's voice reverberated in the cave. It was buzzing.But after a moment, the shadow that was reflected in front of him twisted and swayed. It twisted forward and elongated a little.\"Plop!\"A dark figure separated from Han Li's elongated shadow. It slowly stood up.The figure was dressed in a black robe. His skin was as dark as ink. His appearance was somewhat similar to Han Li's. His black hair wasn't tied up. It was casually draped over his shoulders. His whole body was faintly exuding an indescribable aura of decay.\"Friend Han, long time no see.\" The figure's eyes fell on Han Li. He said in a dull voice.\"Magic Light, what happened? How did you become like this?\" Han Li frowned. He asked in a deep voice.\"I don't know. I didn't wake up a few years earlier than you. When I woke up, I found that I had lost almost all of my spirituality. Only a remnant soul was left.Because of the Heavenly Devil Contract, I can only hide in your shadow. If you don't summon me or someone hurts you, I can't take the initiative to appear in front of others. \"The dark-skinned man's tone didn't change. He answered somewhat mechanically.\"Do you remember what happened recently before you fell asleep?\" Han Li asked after pondering for a moment.\"I remember everything that happened before you ascended. But after you ascended, I only remember that you left the Immortal Platform with that Immortal Gao Sheng. I have no memory of anything after that,\" the dark-skinned man replied slowly.\"So that's how it is. Our memories stop at the moment we left the Immortal Platform.It seemed that if he wanted to understand what had happened, he would have to find Gao Sheng first.However, our current situation isn't too good. According to the information obtained by the Soul Catcher just now, not only are you and I in a lower realm directly under the Darknorth Celestial Domain called the Spirit Huan Domain, but you and I have already lost three hundred years of memories after three hundred years, \"Han Li's eyes flashed as he said.\"It's really terrible!I wonder what Fellow Daoist plans to do? \"The man called Demonshine said with a dull expression.\"Even though you're only left with a wisp of your soul, you were originally a Heavenly Demon, so you should still have some abilities left, right?\" Han Li raised an eyebrow as he retorted.\"I only have about twenty to thirty percent of my magic power left, and I've also lost most of my abilities. I can only use some low-grade mystic techniques,\" Magic Light replied with a bitter expression.Han Li's brows relaxed slightly upon hearing this, and he nodded.\"Mm, that's much better than I expected.In fact, my current situation isn't much better than yours.I've just checked myself and discovered that not only have I lost all of my treasures and pills, I have almost no magic power left, and my consciousness and physical body have also been severely injured. I only have about a tenth of my peak power left. Fortunately, I've already awakened, and as long as I can find suitable spirit medicines, I should be able to recover quickly.Also, I can sense Daoist Xie and the Gold Devouring Beetle King through our soul contract, but I don't know where they are. I'll have to think of a way to find them in the future. \"\"In that case, it looks like you're in deep trouble.If you want to find that Gao Sheng, you'll have to return to the Darknorth Immortal Realm first.If I recall correctly, ascension to the lower realms of the True Immortal Realm is much easier than ascension to other realms, but you'll still need the Immortal Platform to guide you and your magic power to forcefully break through the realm, \"Magic Light said after a moment of silence.\"There's no rush to return to the True Immortal Realm.I'll have plenty of time to think about it, but there's one thing I can be sure of; no matter who caused Han to fall into this predicament, I'll be sure to have a good chat with them when I get back, \"Han Li replied in a calm manner.Magic Light didn't say anything further upon hearing this.\"Are you still willing to follow Han, Fellow Daoist Magic Light?As you can see, I'm currently in an extremely dire situation, so I won't stop you if you want to leave. \"\"Why bother testing me, Fellow Daoist?Although I'm just a remnant soul with incomplete spirituality, the Heavenly Devil Contract is still in effect. I can't even defy the power of the contract now.In my current situation, if I were to leave you, I'm afraid it'll be even more dangerous, \"Magic Light replied mechanically.\"Alright, since you've said so, I won't mistreat you. As long as Han recovers his magic power, I'll definitely find a way to restore your soul's spirituality.Now, the first thing we need to do is to collect some information and resources from this realm to see if we can restore our magic power. \"Han Li finally smiled upon hearing this.\"I'll leave it to Friend Han to decide.It's not appropriate for me to appear outside for too long, so I'll go back and recuperate. \"Magic Light said calmly. Then, his figure blurred and turned into a cloud of black mist that surged towards Han Li's shadow on the ground. Soon, he disappeared.Han Li let out a long breath and looked at Liu Le 'er who was still in a deep sleep. Then, he slowly closed his eyes and adjusted his breathing.Half a day later, Liu Le 'er, who had been in a deep sleep, finally woke up.She opened her eyes and saw Han Li sitting cross-legged beside her with his eyes closed. I, who had previously harbored ill intentions towards them, was standing at the side with a careful expression.\"You're awake \u2026\" Almost at the same time, Han Li opened his eyes and said with a smile.Liu Le 'er's body suddenly stiffened. She stared at Han Li's eyes with a complicated expression. After a long time, she muttered, \"Brother Stone, you \u2026 you've recovered from your illness \u2026\"\"Le 'er, my name is Han Li. You can call me Big Brother Han from now on.\" Han Li replied gently.\"Han \u2026 Big Brother Han,\" Liu Le 'er heard this and her expression changed a few times. She couldn't help but become gloomy and called out reluctantly.At this moment, the tall Youth looked a little strange to her.Han Li saw all the changes in her expression and couldn't help but smile.\"Don't worry. Although I've woken up, I still remember the things that happened in the past few years clearly. I'm still your Brother Stone. This will never change.\"Hearing this, the young girl was overjoyed. With tears in her eyes, she called out, \"Brother Stone.\" Then, she couldn't help but throw herself into Han Li's arms.\"I know you have a stomach full of questions, but now is not the time to explain. When there is a suitable opportunity in the future, I will tell you everything.\" Han Li rubbed the young girl's head dotingly and said softly.Liu Le 'er nodded sensibly and didn't ask any more questions. However, she looked at I, who was standing at the side with an extremely nervous expression. Her expression became a little bewildered.\u2026 \u2026The official WeChat account (wang--yu----) had already released a virtual dynamic 3D image of \"Han Li.\"After replying to \"See Han Li quickly,\" an incredible scene immediately appeared!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the future, he wouldn't dare to attack you even if he had ten times the courage.\" Han Li stood up and said with a smile, his eyes inadvertently glancing at Bai Shi Zhenren.I's body suddenly trembled, and he hurriedly nodded like a chick pecking rice. His back was already dripping with cold sweat.Seeing this, Liu Le 'er's expression finally relaxed.\"Come, let's go out.\"Han Li took Liu Le 'er's slender little hand and walked to the front of the stone door of the secret room in the rockery. He raised a palm and pressed it against the stone door.Just as he was about to push it open, his movements suddenly paused and his brows furrowed.Liu Le 'er felt the subtle change in Han Li. She raised her head and looked at him, a trace of confusion in her eyes.\"What a coincidence!\"Han Li chuckled. Without further hesitation, he pushed open the stone door and walked out in large strides.The sky outside was dark and gloomy, and it was already night time. However, looking out from the small island, the entire Yu Prefecture was currently in flames, as if it were daytime.Waves of heart-palpitating shouts came from the front yard, mixed with the roar of a huge explosion.Thick smoke rose everywhere in Yu Prefecture, like a thick black and gray demon dragon, twisting and rising into the night sky.Even though Han Li's group was on the island in the middle of the lake, far away from the settlement of the people of Yu Prefecture, the air was still filled with an abnormally thick smell of blood.\"This \u2026 what's going on?\" Liu Le 'er looked at the flames of Yu Prefecture, her face full of disbelief.\"White Stone, do you know what's going on?\" Han Li asked indifferently.\"This junior also doesn't know what's going on. Perhaps the enemies of the Yu Family have come to find us.\"Bai Shi Zhenren said hesitantly. Then, he looked at Han Li respectfully, as if everything was up to him.Han Li glanced at Liu Le 'er beside him and found that the young girl was also looking up at him. After pondering for a moment, he said,\"No matter what, I owe Miss Seven a favor for being able to wake up this time. I can't just leave like this. Let's go and take a look.\"After that, the three of them walked out of the Taoist temple, went down the mountain, and walked along the stone bridge to the front yard of Yu Prefecture.The closer they got, the clearer the battle cries became. When the three of them arrived at the circular arched door, a miserable scene like that of Asura appeared in front of them.In the small courtyard behind the arched door, there were layers upon layers of badly mutilated corpses. Most of them were dressed in the uniforms of the Prime Minister's manor guards. Only a few of them were dressed in black.The courtyard was illuminated by the fire. In a corner near the front yard, there was a semi-arc-shaped white light curtain that blocked more than ten black-clothed people outside.At this time, a spiral-shaped fire awl as thick as an adult's arm shot out from among the black-clothed people. When it flew several feet above the light curtain, the awl's head suddenly turned downwards. Like a fire dragon, it spun rapidly and swooped down.\"Boom!\" A loud sound was heard!The spiral-shaped fire awl smashed onto the layer of light curtain, causing the light, which was not very solid, to immediately disperse. Then, with a \"Pa!\" sound, it completely shattered.\"Kill!\"Immediately after, a deep voice sounded.The dozen black-clothed people immediately brandished their swords and rushed toward the corner.\"Save them!\"Han Li didn't move. He only lightly spat out two words.Bai Shi Zhenren, who was at the side, immediately stepped into the courtyard. He suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a black light.The snake-shaped flying sword flashed in the air and in the blink of an eye, it arrived above the black-clothed people's heads.A sharp \"Zheng!\" sound was heard.The flying sword suddenly shook in the air. Dozens of black sword-qi swiftly shot out from the sword's body like swimming snakes, and fell straight down.Suddenly, a series of \"Pu Pu\" sounds resounded in the courtyard. It was followed by the sound of painful wailing.Among the dozens of black-clothed people, only a short-bearded man reacted quickly. He turned over and rolled several feet away. The rest of the black-clothed people died on the spot.\"Who is it?\" the short-bearded man shouted in a stern voice.Bai Shi Zhenren ignored him. He put his hand together and waved his fingers. The flying sword that was suspended in the air immediately swooped down, and went straight toward the short-bearded man's chest.The short-bearded man's complexion changed. He shook his sleeve without hesitation, and a small blue shield flew out from his sleeve. It hovered in the air, and grew bigger. It turned into a huge shield in front of his body.At the same time, he raised one of his hands. The flames of the spiral-shaped fire awl soared, and it rapidly collided with the black flying sword.\"Peng!\" a loud sound was heard!Sparks flew in all directions. The spiral-shaped fire awl had already exploded into pieces, and it turned into balls of fire that fell to the ground.As for the black flying sword, it flashed with a black light and directly pierced into the short-bearded man's chest. The huge blue shield was pierced through like paper, and it seemed to be useless.\"A Core Formation cultivator \u2026\" The short-bearded man cried out with difficulty as blood flowed from his nose and mouth.Bai Shi Zhenren waved his hand to recall the flying sword, and he said with disdain, \"A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to \u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, he immediately shut his mouth and peeked at Han Li behind him in fright.Han Li didn't react in the slightest. He simply brought Liu Le 'er to a corner of the courtyard, where two people were huddled together.One of them was a Youth. His green robe was dyed with blood, and his hair was disheveled. Although he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, his breathing was extremely weak. It was obvious that he was about to be exhausted.Behind him was a young girl dressed in servant clothes. Her body was dyed with blood, and she was shivering. She didn't even dare to raise her head.\"Elder Sister Xiao Wu?\" Liu Le 'er stared blankly when she saw the servant girl's face, but she immediately called out to her in a probing manner.The young girl's body stiffened, and she slowly peeked out from behind the Youth. As soon as she saw Le 'er, she burst into tears.Liu Le 'er promptly stepped forward and helped her up.The Youth man paused for a moment, and he also forced himself to stand up. He rushed towards Bai Shi Zhenren and said with a distressed expression, \"Daoist Master \u2026 quickly, quickly go and save Miss Seven.\"Bai Shi Zhenren stared blankly after hearing this. He didn't reply, and instead secretly peeked at Han Li.\"Where is Miss Seven?\" Han Li indifferently asked.The Youth man obviously didn't recognize Han Li. He was stunned for a moment, but he still replied,\"When Xiao Wu and I came to the island in the center of the lake to ask for help, Miss Seven and the others were left at the main residence, protected by a few other consecrated people.However, the enemy's momentum is ferocious, and they probably won't be able to hold on for long. \"\"You stay here and recuperate.Xiao Wu, you're the most familiar with the terrain of Yu Prefecture. Lead the way. \"Han Li lightly instructed.Xiao Wu also stopped crying under the comfort of Liu Le 'er. She looked at Han Li doubtfully.She couldn't imagine that the young man, who used to have a blank expression on his face, would suddenly give orders now.The Youth man was also a little bewildered!At this moment, he could already see that Han Li was the leader of these people. Bai Shi Zhenren, who used to be high and mighty in Yu Prefecture, completely followed this person's lead.\"Hmm, okay.Follow me. \"Xiao Wu nodded subconsciously. She steadied her mind, turned around and trotted towards the front yard. Han Li and the other two also followed.Yu Prefecture had been attacked for some time. The front yard of the mansion was full of corpses. There were guards and soldiers, as well as maids and servants. Those men in black had obviously made up their minds to exterminate the entire Yu Prefecture.Liu Le 'er was frightened along the way. Although she had already experienced the cruelty and bloodthirstiness of the human race, the scene in front of her still refreshed her understanding of this race.Along the way, in addition to the corpses everywhere, they also met several groups of men in black. Almost all of them were killed by Bai Shi Zhenren as soon as they met.Occasionally, they also met the leading cultivators, but most of them were only at the Foundational Stage. They were no match for Bai Shi Zhenren at all.The four of them passed through the halls and corridors, all the way to the main mansion.\u2026The official WeChat account (wang--yu----) had already released a virtual dynamic 3D image of \"Han Li\".After replying to \"See Han Li quickly\", an incredible scene immediately appeared!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe main residence of the Yu Clan.The house that was originally filled with flowers had completely turned into a pile of broken walls. As far as the eye could see, there were corpses everywhere, blood covered the ground, and the air was suffused with a dense smell of blood that made one feel nauseous.Most of the Yu Clan's survivors were gathered here. There were only about twenty of them, young and old. Miss Yu, Second Young Master Yu, and the others were among them.Everyone had a panicked expression on their faces and the graceful matrons were trembling. Only Seventh Young Miss Yu and a few others were able to maintain a calm expression on their faces.There were a lot of black-clothed people here, about thirty of them. They surrounded the Yu Family from three sides and trapped them in the courtyard. These people were divided into small groups of three to five, and most of them were holding various magic tools. They were all cultivators.Fortunately, the other Yu Family's revered elders finally arrived and protected the Yu Family's group.After all, the Yu Clan was the residence of the prime minister of Toyokuni, and the cultivators they supported were quite powerful. In particular, there was a middle-aged cultivator in a red robe standing in front of the Yu Clan members. He had a pockmarked face and a short stature. He looked unremarkable, but his entire body was shrouded in red light and emitted the enormous spiritual pressure of a Core Formation cultivator.A scarlet fire bead magic treasure floated above his head, and several scarlet fireballs danced around it. It was an astonishing scene.The other three Yu Clan experts were two men and one woman. Although their cultivation was inferior to the former, they still appeared to be extraordinary.One of them was a black-clothed woman with delicate features and a scar on her face. The other was a tall, thin, and sunken middle-aged man. They stood on either side of the red-robed cultivator.The last one was a skinny old man with rough hands and dark skin. He looked like an old farmer from the countryside.Although there were Core Formation cultivators, there were only four of them. They had to split their attention to protect the Yu Clan members, so they were in a deadlock with the surrounding black-clothed cultivators.\"We can't continue like this. Protect Miss Seven and the others. When the opportunity arises, we'll rush out!\"The red-robed middle-aged man was a Core Formation cultivator. When none of the surrounding black-clothed cultivators answered him, he finally became furious. He gave an order to the other three experts and formed an incantation gesture. He opened his mouth and spat out a red light into the scarlet fire bead above his head.The scarlet fire bead's speed suddenly increased, and it became blurry.Then, a dozen or so huge fireballs flew out of it and quickly fused together to form a thick fire dragon that was over a hundred feet long.Roar!This Fire Dragon was covered in fiery red scales. With a furious roar, it bared its fangs and brandished its claws as it pounced into the group of black-robed men.Boom!The small group of black-clothed men at the front were caught off guard and were sent flying by the fire dragon. Two of them even turned into ashes.Immediately after, the thick Fire Dragon swung its tail fiercely, setting off a layer of fire waves. Upon seeing this, the surrounding people all retreated to avoid it.After a moment of commotion, the black-robed cultivator immediately reacted. Various magic tools and magic techniques rained down on the fire dragon's body.The Fire Dragon's huge body swayed left and right from the bombardment, and the flames on its body surged. However, it did not harm its core, and it continued to attack in all directions. In a few breaths, a small half of the black-robed men were either dead or injured.\"Go!\"The red-robed cultivator shouted at the black-robed young woman and the others.However, at this time, there was a \"sou\" sound, and a blurry black light shot out with incomparable speed. It was like a bolt of black lightning, and it struck the Fire Dragon's lower abdomen.Puchi!The black light pierced deeply into the Fire Dragon's body. It was a long black arrow, and the body of the arrow was faintly engraved with black talisman characters.Boom!The talisman characters on the body of the arrow suddenly flared with black light, and it suddenly exploded. It was like a lightning strike, and a huge red and black mushroom cloud burst out, causing the ground nearby to tremble.A large hole was immediately blasted into the Fire Dragon's lower abdomen, and its body flashed wildly.Seeing this, the red-robed cultivator and the other three consecrated men were all shocked!At the gate not far away, a black-robed man had appeared out of nowhere. He held a pitch-black bow in his hand, and his body was surrounded by black light. Impressively, he was at the peak of Foundation Establishment Stage.The darkness behind him moved, and four black-robed men walked out. They were all at the peak of Foundation Establishment Stage, and they also held black bows in their hands. They nocked arrows, pulled the bowstrings, and shot.Swoosh! Swoosh!Swoosh! Swoosh! Four pitch-black talisman arrows shot out like meteors, streaking through the night sky in cold arcs, as swift as lightning.The red-robed cultivator changed his hand seals repeatedly, driving the Fire Dragon to dodge. However, its body was too huge, and the archery skills of those people were excellent. He only managed to dodge one arrow, and the other three talisman arrows hit their mark.Rumble!The three talisman arrows exploded at the same time!Three more large holes were blasted into the Fire Dragon's body, and it could no longer maintain its shape. With a loud bang, it dissipated into scarlet flames that filled the sky, and disappeared without a trace.The red-robed cultivator grunted, and his body swayed.Right at that moment, another ghostly wail and wolf howl sounded, and a pale white light shot out from the darkness. Its speed was several times faster than the talisman arrows, and in the blink of an eye, it arrived in front of the red-robed cultivator.The red-robed cultivator was greatly alarmed and the scarlet flame bead on top of his head immediately flew out to meet the white light while he himself flew backwards. At the same time, he raised his hand and a blue and red light flew out. It was a small blue sword and a scarlet pitchfork respectively. They also attacked the white light.The white light flashed, and its true form was revealed. It was a three feet long bone saber, surrounded by gusts of sinister wind.The bone saber buzzed, and a large patch of black threads appeared on its surface, wrapping around the Scarlet Fire Bead, the small blue sword, and the scarlet pitchfork.The spirit light on the surface of the three Dharma treasures dimmed, and they immediately became sluggish, on the verge of collapse.With a flash, the bone saber passed through the three Dharma treasures, and appeared near the red-robed cultivator's head out of thin air, twisting at lightning speed.\"Ah \u2026\"The red-robed cultivator let out a miserable cry, but it came to an abrupt halt. His head tilted and fell from his neck.A fountain of blood gushed out, shooting several feet into the air. The headless corpse swayed, and fell to the ground.\"Venerable Red Robe!\"Everyone from the Yu Family exclaimed.The black-robed woman and the other two elders were also shocked, and they all took a few steps back, at a loss of what to do.Immediately afterward, a sinister-looking Youth slowly walked out from the crowd. He was the one who had been spying on them from Mingyuan City, but the grey-robed man wasn't with him.When the black-robed men saw the Sinister-Looking Youth appear, they immediately stopped and bowed.The Sinister-Looking Youth waved his hand, and the white bone saber immediately flew back to him, along with the three Dharma treasures of the red-robed cultivator.His gaze swept over the three Dharma treasures with a trace of disdain, but he still put them away with a wave of his hand. Only then did he look at the Yu Family, and coldly said, \"Kill them all.\"Kill them all. Leave no one alive.\"\"Yes!\" The black-robed men hurriedly replied and stepped forward.The three Yu Family elders' expressions were extremely ugly, but they didn't stop them.When the women and children of the Yu Prefecture saw this, some began to weep loudly, while others collapsed to the ground. Some of them couldn't even control themselves on the spot.\"Wait!\"A pleasant voice was heard, and a person stepped out from the crowd. It was Miss Seven.At this moment, she had changed into a man's clothes again, but it still couldn't hide the trace of tenderness between her brows.\"It's you!\"The Sinister-Looking Youth's eyes lit up, and his lustful gaze kept moving on Miss Seven's body.Miss Seven's face was pale, but she could barely maintain her composure. She resisted the urge to gouge out his eyes, and took out a purple-gold token from her bosom.The token was engraved with a vivid purple-gold flame pattern.\"Who are you people? How dare you slaughter my Yu Prefecture? Do you not respect the Leng Yan Sect at all!\"\u2026 \u2026The official WeChat account (wang--yu----) had already released a virtual, dynamic 3D image of \"Han Li\".After replying to \"See Han Li ASAP\", an incredible scene immediately appeared!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"It's the Leng Yan Sect's Token of Guidance.Speaking of which, Miss Seven is the most beautiful woman in Mingyuan City. I've been longing for her for a long time. Now that I've seen her today, she's indeed as beautiful as jade. \"The evil Youth's eyes fell on the Purple Gold Token. He grinned and looked at Miss Seven again. A hint of amazement flashed across his face.\"I don't care who you are. Leave the Yu Residence immediately. Otherwise, you'll be publicly making an enemy of the Cold Flame Sect.\" Seeing that the other party recognized the token in her hand, the Seventh Young Miss couldn't help but feel a bit more confident.\"Miss Seven, so you've been chosen by the Leng Yan Sect!\"The young woman in black and the other two Yu Family Guardians had originally planned to stay out of this. Seeing this, they all became spirited.The Yu Family members also had a glimmer of hope.\"Haha!Leng Yan Sect? What's so great about it? \"The evil Youth saw this and suddenly laughed wildly.\"How dare you look down on the Leng Yan Sect!\" Miss Seven's face darkened and she shouted angrily.\"Look down on me?You're not an official disciple of the Leng Yan Sect. You only have a Token of Guidance. Even if you are, so what? \"The evil Youth sneered. He flipped his hand and took out a black token. It was the same size as the Purple Gold Token in Yu Qi's hand. A silver skull pattern was carved on it.\"This is \u2026 the Tengui School's Inner Disciple Token!You're from the Tengui School! \"Miss Yu's expression changed.\"The Tengui School that is as famous as the Leng Yan Sect!\"The three cultivators all drew a sharp breath upon hearing this before exchanging a glance with one another and remaining silent.\"Even if you're a disciple of the Tengui School, Toyokuni belongs to the Leng Yan Sect. Are you trying to start a war between the two sects by recklessly invading them?\" Miss Seven seemed to have thought of something, and her face regained some color.\"Hehe, Miss Seven is indeed eloquent. Unfortunately, you're wrong about one thing,\" the Evil Youth said contemptuously.Miss Seven was slightly startled when she heard this.\"To tell you the truth, the Leng Yan Sect was defeated in the last competition, and they have handed over the control of Toyokuni. Now, the entire Toyokuni belongs to our Tengui School,\" said the Evil Youth with a cruel smile.When Yu Qi heard this, it was as if she had been struck by lightning. She was completely dumbfounded.The black-clothed woman and the other three Yu Family Guardians were also shocked, and they unconsciously retreated, deliberately putting some distance between them and the Yu Family.At this moment, the Yu Family members' faces were even more unsightly, and their hearts sank.Although they didn't know much about the World of Cultivators, they could still understand the general idea from the conversation between Miss Seven and the Evil Youth.\"Right, there's one more thing I forgot to tell you. I think Miss Seven will be very interested.\" A strange light appeared in the Evil Youth's eyes, and the corners of his mouth curled into a malicious smile.\"What?\"Yu Qi's heart sank. She vaguely guessed that what the Evil Youth said was definitely not something good, but she couldn't help but ask.\"Some officials of the Toyokuni Royal Family dared to disobey the orders of our Tengui School. After these people were arrested, they were convicted of treason. Yesterday, they were beheaded in Feng Jing. It seems that Prime Minister Yu and his two sons, who are also civil officials, were among them.\" The Evil Youth looked into Miss Seven's eyes and said word by word.\"Father!Eldest Brother, Third Brother! \"Miss Seven's vision darkened. Her body swayed, and she fell to the ground. The token in her hand also fell to the ground with a clatter.When the rest of the Yu Family heard this, they all looked desperate. The graceful women couldn't help but burst into tears and collapsed to the ground.Just a moment ago, they were still the noble people of the Prime Minister's Mansion, respected by the world. In the blink of an eye, they encountered a great change. The Prime Minister was killed, their family was destroyed, and they were reduced to fish on the chopping block.\"Haha \u2026 haha!\"The Evil Youth saw the expression on Miss Seven's face. His cheeks flushed red, and his eyes showed a morbid excitement. He laughed wildly, as if he had gone mad.Forcing people into the abyss of despair and then enjoying their helpless expressions was what he liked to do the most.The Evil Youth laughed wildly for a while, and the redness on his face gradually faded. He waved his hand and coldly ordered:\"Kill all of them. Leave the Seventh Young Miss alive.\"The surrounding men in black agreed in unison, and walked towards the Yu Family with hideous smiles.The woman in black and the other two priests had already retreated to the side, looking for an opportunity to escape. Seeing this, the Evil Youth smiled proudly and didn't stop them.\"Hehe, Young Master Qi, you have a good eye. Although this girl hasn't started cultivating yet, the Cold Flame Sect has given her a Welcome Token and is ready to take her in as a disciple. Her aptitude should be pretty good. She's very suitable to be your Cultivation Cauldron.\" A black-clothed man came to the side of the evil youth and flattered him.The nefarious young man burst into laughter again when he heard this.Miss Seven's body trembled, and her eyes became clear again. A trace of determination flashed across her face. She touched her waist with her left hand, and a shiny dagger appeared. She stabbed it towards her heart.The Evil Youth's smile froze. He didn't expect her to be so unyielding. He wanted to stop her, but it was too late.Swish!With a piercing sound, a sharp wind flew and hit the dagger in Miss Seven's hand.With a \"clang\", the dagger was knocked away and fell to the ground.Swish! Swish!Several sharp gusts of wind blew towards the black-clothed men who were about to slaughter the Yu Family.A series of screams sounded. The wind was so powerful that a few men in black were hit by it, and they spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood.The rest of the people stopped in their tracks in shock.\"Who is it?\"The Evil Youth shouted. He suddenly turned around and looked at an intersection not far away.The people around him also looked in that direction.A series of footsteps sounded, and a few people slowly walked out. It was Han Li, Bai Shi Zhenren, and the others.The Evil Youth squinted his eyes and looked at them. His gaze stopped on Han Li for a moment, and then quickly moved to Bai Shi Zhenren.\"Bai Shi Zhenren!\"\"Immortal, save us!\"The people of the Yu Clan were originally waiting for death in despair. When they saw Bai Shi Taoist, a Core Bearing Stage cultivator, appear, it was as if they were grasping at straws of life.\"Miss!\"Xiao Wu didn't care about the men in black. She rushed to Yu Qi's side and helped her up.\"Xiao Wu.\"Miss Qi looked at the old Taoist priest not far away with a complicated expression.Although Bai Shi Zhenren was a Core Bearing Stage cultivator, the Red Robed Master was also a Core Bearing Stage cultivator, but he was easily killed by the Evil Youth. Bai Shi Zhenren might not be able to defeat the enemy in front of her.Her eyes suddenly flashed and fell on Han Li.Han Li's appearance didn't change at all, but his eyes were no longer blank. Instead, his body was filled with a faint sense of calmness.\"You are Bai Shi Zhenren?Hmph!Let me give you a piece of advice. If you still want to live, don't meddle in other people's business! \"The Evil Youth stared at Bai Shi Zhenren. The black light on his body suddenly brightened, and a huge pressure spread out.The sharp wind just now was strangely powerful, but it was tangible and intangible, as if it had appeared out of thin air.Although the Evil Youth was experienced and knowledgeable, he couldn't guess how the sharp wind was produced. He was a bit afraid of White Stone Daoist, so he released his spiritual pressure to make him retreat.Bai Shi Zhenren's body trembled, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.The pressure emitted by the Evil Youth had reached the middle stage of the Core Bearing Stage. Bai Shi Zhenren was only in the early stage of the Core Bearing Stage, so he was no match for this person. He couldn't help but squint at Han Li.He clearly saw that the sharp wind just now was just a few strands of wind that this \"Senior Han\" had casually flicked out.Han Li's face revealed a faint smile, but he didn't say anything.I's heart turned cold, and he immediately made a decision. He righteously and sternly shouted, \"Hmph!Since I am a Minister of Yu Prefecture, how can I just stand by and watch?You people are extremely daring. How dare you commit such a sin of murder? This is simply intolerable! \"The Evil Youth's face turned violent, and he angrily said, \"Fine. Since you are tired of living, then you can die together with me!\"As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand, and the white bone knife flew out, slashing towards Bai Shi Zhenren.At the same time, he changed the incantation gesture in his hand, and the bone knife suddenly burst out with a large white light. Within the light, the shadows of snow-white skulls appeared, and the ghostly wails and howls of the skulls were extremely powerful.\u2026 \u2026The official WeChat account (wang--yu----) had already released a virtual dynamic 3D image of \"Han Li\".After replying to \"See Han Li quickly,\" an incredible scene immediately appeared!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Be careful, Immortal. That Bone Saber is very powerful. The Red-robed Master was killed by it!\" Miss Seven warned.Bai Shi Zhenren was shocked when he saw the power of the Bone Saber. His facial expression changed when he heard Miss Seven's words. However, he thought of Han Li. He clenched his teeth, opened his mouth, and spat out a snake-shaped flying sword. Then, he made a sign with his hands.\"Chi La!\"The sword emitted a black light. It looked like a black python that wrapped around the Bone Saber.The Evil Youth sneered. He changed the sign with his hands, and pointed his finger.The Bone Saber shone brightly and twisted.\"Bang!\" The black sword-light shattered. The snake-shaped flying sword broke into several pieces and fell to the ground.Bai Shi Taoist waved his hands hastily, and a green round shield in the shape of a copper coin flew out to meet the Bone Saber.The Bone Saber's light dimmed, but its power didn't diminish. It fiercely chopped the green round shield.\"Crack!\"The Bone Saber chopped the green round shield into two halves. It paused for a moment. Then, the saber light shone brightly again, and continued to chop toward I.I was shocked. He took advantage of the gap between the green round shield and the attack to hide behind Han Li.If it had been before, he would've been able to contend with the Evil Youth even if he couldn't defeat him. However, most of his magic weapons had been destroyed when he fought with Han Li. So, he couldn't resist the Bone Saber.The saber light flashed, and appeared in front of Han Li in the blink of an eye. The cold light rolled out again. He intended to cut Han Li and Bai Shi Zhenren into four pieces at the waist.\"Senior \u2026\" Bai Shi Zhenren called out in a low voice.Han Li looked indifferent. Then, he raised one of his hands. A golden halo flashed in his palm, and golden scales appeared. Then, he stretched out his five fingers like lightning.\"Clang!\" A light sound rang out!The dazzling blade light and the ghostly wails and wolf howls suddenly disappeared, turning into a grayish-white short blade that was a few inches long in Han Li's hand. The short blade bounced between his fingers like a small fish, but it couldn't break free.\"How is this possible \u2026\"The Evil Youth's eyes bulged. He couldn't believe what he was seeing.This bone saber looked ordinary, but it was actually a replica refined by the elders of his clan using countless precious materials to imitate the sect's most valuable treasure, the \"Heavenly Ghost Saber\". It was extremely powerful, and even a late Core Formation cultivator wouldn't dare to take it lightly. At this moment, however, it was actually caught by someone's bare hands.Everyone present was dumbfounded, their mouths agape.\"Liu Shi \u2026\" Miss Seven's pretty face was also filled with astonishment, and her beautiful eyes flickered as she looked at Han Li.Bai Shi Zhenren was also dumbfounded. Although he had guessed that Han Li might be able to block the bone knife, he didn't expect that it would be so easy.Just how powerful was this \"Senior Han\"?While he was shocked, he was also somewhat relieved.Luckily, when the two of them were fighting, Han Li didn't use too much strength. Otherwise, he wouldn't be alive right now.Other than the excited expression on her face, Liu Le 'er didn't feel too surprised.In her eyes, \"Brother Stone\" was incomparably powerful, and it wasn't strange for him to do anything.\"Such a low level evil treasure, I haven't seen it in a long time.\" Han Li glanced at the object in his hand and said softly. Then, he suddenly closed his fingers.\"Peng!\"The mini bone knife was instantly crushed, turning into specks of grey light that floated to the ground.\"No!\"The Evil Youth's face turned white and he spat out a mouthful of blood.This knife was his life treasure. Now that it was destroyed, it was the same as chopping off one of his arms.\"You dared to destroy my treasure. Then, pay with your life!\"The young man's eyes were incomparably resentful. He formed a seal with both hands and roared loudly. Strands of black gas emitted from his body and condensed into a pitch-black cloud in the blink of an eye. Countless blurry ghostly shadows vaguely appeared within the cloud.Not only that, the Evil Youth hit his chest three times at lightning speed and spat out three mouthfuls of blood. Every time he spat out a mouthful of blood, his face became paler. After he had spat out three mouthfuls of blood, his face was as pale as a piece of paper.As soon as the blood was spat out, it turned into a thick blood mist and blended into the black cloud.The black cloud instantly turned into a blood cloud. Then, it rolled violently and expanded several times. The vague ghost shadows inside also became several times more solid and let out mournful howls.The Evil Youth's body shrank and silently disappeared into the blood cloud.All of this was complicated, but it happened in the blink of an eye.The moment the blood cloud appeared, the temperature of the entire house dropped sharply, as if it had suddenly fallen into a cold cave.Even with Spiritual Master White Stone's cultivation base, he shuddered in fear. He hastily activated a jade-like treasure that flickered with white light, shielding himself and Liu Le 'er, who was not far away, and retreated far away.The surrounding black-clothed men, members of the Yu Family, and the three priests were so cold that their faces turned deathly pale. Their bodies trembled violently.Liu Le 'er instantly felt a chill run down her body. Then, it warmed up. A white light shield protected her.It was unknown when Taoist Master White Stone had appeared beside him, but he was also using a jade pendant shaped treasure that flickered with white light to conceal himself within it.When he saw the young girl looking at him, I gave her a flattering smile. Then, he protected the young girl and retreated more than a hundred feet away.Han Li looked at the blood cloud in the sky and revealed a strange expression. Then, he suddenly turned his hand and punched at a nearby void.\"Boom!\"A faint ghostly figure flew out from the ripples in the void, but with a mournful wail in mid-air, it turned into a grey mist and exploded.But at this moment, there was a loud \"chi chi\" sound from below Han Li. Several black chains shot out like poisonous snakes, instantly binding Han Li's body.Immediately afterward, a grey-robed man silently emerged from the ground nearby while making a hand seal. He was none other than the other companion who had appeared with the sinister youth in Mingyuan City.The aura emitted by this person was above that of the Evil Youth. However, his body was covered by a black ghost shadow. The two seemed to have fused together. His body also became translucent, as if he could disappear into the void at any time.\"Haha, Senior Brother Fan, you've come at the right time. Let's kill this guy together!\" The Evil Youth laughed wildly from the blood cloud. Then, he muttered something.A strong wind blew, and the blood cloud rolled like a huge wave.Han Li remained completely expressionless as he stood completely still on the spot, allowing the crimson clouds to envelop him.The eyes of the ghosts in the blood cloud were bloodthirsty. They bared their fangs and roared as they pounced forward. It seemed that they wanted to divide Han Li and eat him.Seeing this, the Evil Youth was overjoyed.These blood souls were refined using a special secret method. They were in between a spiritual body and a physical body. They were extremely difficult to kill. As long as one was entangled by them, they would be like maggots in one's bones. Only death awaited them.\"I don't care who you are. If you dare to oppose my Tengui School, I will destroy your soul!\"Although the man in grey was surprised that Han Li had seen through the hidden ghosts he had summoned earlier, he still had a cruel expression on his face.Then, with a sway of his body, he strangely appeared above Han Li in the blood cloud. He clapped his hands, and two huge black ghost claws appeared. The claws were surrounded by a dark green light and emitted a foul smell. It seemed that they were extremely poisonous. He clawed down fiercely.\"Brother!\" When Liu Le 'er saw this, she was about to pounce on him without any regard for anything else.\"You can't go over!Senior Han is powerful. He must have a way to escape. \"Bai Shi Zhenren grabbed Liu Le 'er in shock.Although he said so, he couldn't help but feel nervous. Another strong enemy had suddenly appeared, and it seemed that this one was even more difficult to deal with than the first one. He didn't know if \"Senior Han\" could handle it.In the distance, the expressions of Miss Seven and the others changed greatly. Everyone's hearts were in their throats.Han Li chuckled. He didn't move at all, but a burst of firecracker-like sounds suddenly came from his body. His body suddenly swelled up, and golden scales appeared on the surface of his body.\"Kacha.\"With a sway of his shoulders, the black chains that wrapped around his body immediately broke apart. His arms blurred again, and densely packed golden fist shadows appeared, bombarding the surroundings like a violent storm.\"Peng peng\" sounds rang out continuously.When the black ghost claws touched the golden fist shadows, they immediately shattered with a crisp sound like porcelain breaking. The grey-clothed man was also hit by the countless fist shadows. The black ghost shadows on his body immediately shattered, and his body flew out like a broken sack. He heavily smashed on the ground in a bloody mess. His physical body and soul were shattered in an instant, and he no longer had any signs of life.At the same time, the whole blood cloud and the ghost shadows inside were swept away by the golden fist shadows. Amidst the thunderous roar, the figure of the Evil Youth was revealed.At this moment, he was dumbstruck. However, when he met Han Li's cold gaze, his whole body suddenly trembled. Without saying anything, he changed his hand sign, and a large black cloud surged out from the surface of his body. He turned around and shot into the distance.When Han Li saw this, his eyes narrowed. He suddenly took a deep breath, and his chest puffed up. Then, he opened his mouth and spat.\"Sou!\" A white light shot out from his mouth, and with a flash, it disappeared into the black cloud.After a mournful scream, the black cloud suddenly collapsed with a loud bang. A corpse with a bloody hole in its forehead fell from the sky. It was the Evil Youth.There was a complete silence, and even the sound of a pin dropping could be heard!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFrom the moment the grey-robed man suddenly appeared and attacked Han Li with the demonic Youth, to when Han Li counterattacked and killed the two of them, only two to three breaths had passed.Two Core Formation Stage cultivators, who were insufferably arrogant, had fallen here so easily. This caused everyone, including the Yu Clan members and the black-robed man, to be dumbfounded.Especially the last white light that shot out from Han Li's mouth. It came and went without a trace, and in the blink of an eye, it killed the demonic Youth who had already escaped to the edge of the horizon. In addition, someone shouted \"Sword Cultivator\", causing the group of black-robed men to be scared witless. They didn't dare to stay any longer, and they all took out their magic weapons in an attempt to escape from Yu Prefecture.It should be known that in the Spirit Huan Domain, Sword Cultivators could easily crush cultivators of the same level. In addition, the speed of the flying sword was extremely fast, and it could kill people without leaving. If they didn't leave now, they wouldn't be able to even if they wanted to later.For a moment, in the courtyard of the main residence in Yu Prefecture, the magic weapons shone brightly. Dozens of flying shuttles shot into the sky and escaped in all directions.Han Li didn't even look at these people. He only looked in the direction of the demonic Youth's corpse. He raised his eyebrows slightly, and a thoughtful expression appeared on his face.As a result, the Yu Clan members looked at each other, and no one dared to say anything to disturb him. As for the black-robed woman and the other two High Priests, they didn't even dare to breathe too loudly.On the other hand, Bai Shi Zhenren secretly glanced at Han Li. After a moment of hesitation, he suddenly waved his right hand at the fleeing black-robed cultivators.With a slight flick of his sleeve, a long golden rope instantly flew out like a poisonous snake coming out of its hole. It suddenly coiled in mid-air and flew back at high speed.There was a \"bang\" sound.A slender black-robed cultivator was pulled back by the golden rope. He was tied up like a rice dumpling, and fell to the ground in front of Han Li.\"Spare \u2026 spare me \u2026\" The black-robed cultivator fell to the ground, and didn't care about the pain. When he saw Han Li, he immediately struggled and begged for mercy.\"Do you know this Tengui School?\" Han Li didn't look at the black-robed cultivator in front of him, and asked Bai Shi Zhenren.\"The Tengui School and the Leng Yan Sect are both top sects in the Spirit Huan Domain.\" Bai Shi Zhenren looked at Miss Seven and replied carefully.\"How many people did the Tengui School send to Mingyuan City?\" Han Li nodded and looked down at the black-robed man.\"Re \u2026 Reporting to Senior, as far as I know, only these people came to the Yu Residence.\" The black-clothed cultivator struggled to sit up and hastily replied.However, as soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly felt his entire body turn cold, as if he had fallen into an icehouse.All he could see was that the tall Youth in front of him suddenly stared at him with an extremely cold gaze. That pair of pitch-black eyes seemed to suddenly become incomparably huge, turning into two bottomless black whirlpools. As long as he dared to tell a lie, he would immediately be swallowed up.This feeling was fleeting, but the hairs on his body stood on end, and the clothes on his back were soaked in cold sweat.\"Senior, please calm your anger. Everything I said is true!We are only inner and outer disciples of the sect. We are only here to carry out orders. As for whether there are other disciples of our sect in the city, we really do not know. \"The black-robed cultivator wanted to kneel down and kowtow, but he was unable to do so due to the binding of the golden rope. He could only bury his head deeply.\"We are following orders!Han Li glanced at the corpse of the Demonic Youth in the distance and asked calmly.\"Yes, he \u2026 he is called Qi Minghao. He is an inner disciple of our sect. He is very talented and is highly regarded by the sect.He also has a granduncle from the same clan who is an elder of our sect. With this backing, we really don't dare to disobey his orders. If I had known that Yu Residence was under the protection of Senior, I wouldn't have dared to take even half a step into Yu Residence even if you lent me a hundred orders. \"The black-clothed cultivator nodded repeatedly and continued to plead.It was unknown when Miss Seven had walked over. Her eyes were slightly red as she asked, \"Then what Qi Minghao said before, was it all true?My father and the others have already \u2026 \"\"We outer disciples are not qualified to participate in the matters of Plentiful City. But as far as I know, it is more or less the same as what Qi Minghao said.\" The black-robed cultivator answered with some fear.Miss Yu closed her eyes when she heard this, and two drops of tears quickly fell from the corners of her eyes.The women and children of the Yu Family began to weep again.\"Since your Tengui School has already taken over Toyokuni, it is enough to control the original imperial family. Why do you want to exterminate my Yu Clan?\" Miss Seven opened her beautiful eyes and asked with a pained expression.\"This is the sect's custom. In order to completely control Toyokuni, the imperial family members who had previously had relations with the Leng Yan Sect, as well as the officials and families who were loyal to the original imperial family, will be completely massacred. The Yu Clan is one of them.Everyone \u2026 please don't blame me for speaking out of turn. That Elder Qi is extremely famous in the sect for protecting his own. He will certainly pursue the matter of his grandnephew's death to the end. Even us outer disciples who came with him will certainly be implicated in his rage and killed. \"The black-robed cultivator suddenly thought of something and replied with a trembling voice, his face full of fear.When the people of Yu Prefecture heard this, they were immediately terrified. The black-robed woman and the other two remaining elders' expressions also became abnormally unsightly.\"Seventh Sister, what's the point of saying so much? We should also leave quickly.Don't you have a Master in the Leng Yan Sect?Go find her. She will definitely take us in. \"At this moment, the dignified Second Young Master of Yu Prefecture no longer had the appearance of an aristocratic family member. His face was full of tears and stains, and he was almost crying as he begged.The Seventh Young Lady didn't pay any attention to him. She raised her sleeve to wipe the tears on her face and walked in front of Han Li, Liu Le 'er, and Daoist White Stone. She saluted them and respectfully said, \"Thank you for saving my life.\"Han Li didn't say anything and calmly accepted it.Bai Shi Zhenren also nodded and didn't say anything.\"Miss Seven \u2026\"Liu Le 'er, who had also experienced the tragic death of her family, couldn't help but feel a little sad at this moment. She wanted to say a few words of comfort, but didn't know what to say. She could only call out this one sentence and didn't say anything else.Miss Seven nodded at her and reluctantly showed a smile.Then, her face slowly darkened. The previous sadness and disappointment gradually disappeared, and her face gradually became firm, as if she had suddenly changed from Miss Seven to the Seventh Young Master.A white light flashed in her hand, and a bright dagger appeared. It was the one that had been shot down by Han Li before. Without saying a word, she stabbed the black-clothed practitioner's chest.\"Spare my life \u2026\"With a miserable cry, the foot-long dagger sank to the hilt.The black-clothed practitioner fell in a pool of blood. His body twitched a few times, and then he stopped moving.Seeing this, other people of Yu Prefecture couldn't help but look at each other.At this time, Miss Seven looked at the few people who survived the disaster and resolutely said,\"The disaster of Yu Prefecture has become a fact. Now even if we have the support of the Leng Yan Sect, it can't be recovered in a day or two.All relatives of the Yu Family will follow me to the Leng Yan Sect.As for those who are unwilling to follow me, you can take some money from the mansion's treasury and leave. \"The women and children of the Yu Family, who had originally been terrified to the extreme, finally calmed down. They stopped sobbing and gradually settled down.Seeing this, Han Li couldn't help but take a deep look at Miss Seven.\"As for you, Revered Elders, you have risked your life to protect my relatives of Yu Prefecture today.If you want to leave, you can choose as many treasures as you want to take with you.But if you are willing to continue escorting us to the Leng Yan Sect, I will reward you handsomely in the future. \"Then, Miss Seven turned her gaze to the black-clothed woman and the others.Hearing this, the black-clothed woman and the others looked at each other and seemed very hesitant. They all glanced at Han Li and Bai Shi Zhenren.Seeing this, Miss Seven couldn't help but look at Han Li. She suddenly understood. After thinking for a while, she immediately walked a few steps forward and bowed.\"Big Brother Liu, although I don't know your background, I can see that you are a true senior expert. I'm afraid ordinary treasures won't be able to catch your eyes.I'm willing to use a Jiaoyuan bead that has been passed down in my family for generations as a reward. I hope you can escort us to the Leng Yan Sect. \"Miss Seven looked straight at Han Li and said sincerely.Jiaoyuan bead!Hearing this, Bai Shi Zhenren raised his eyebrows and a trace of greed appeared in his eyes. But when he glanced at Han Li from the corner of his eyes, the thought in his mind suddenly disappeared.\"Seventh Sister, are you crazy?How can you talk about the Jiaoyuan bead? \"The second young master of the Yu Family was shocked and hurriedly shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Jiaoyuan bead is an item that can help Core Formation cultivators break through bottlenecks in their cultivation. It truly isn't an ordinary item, but I don't need it. Miss Seven doesn't need it.\" Han Li shook his head.When Miss Seven heard this, her expression changed, but she gritted her teeth and refused to give up, \"If Big Brother Liu has any other requests, please don't hesitate to mention it. As long as it's within an acceptable range, Little Sister will definitely accomplish it.\"\"Speaking of which, I do owe you a favor for allowing me to regain my consciousness.However, I stopped you from killing yourself and helped you kill the two Core Formation cultivators from the Tengui School. No matter how you look at it, I've already repaid my debt of gratitude.Normally, it wouldn't matter, but now that I've just woken up, I still have my own troubles to deal with. I'm afraid I won't have the time to escort you to Leng Yan Sect. \"Han Li indifferently said.When Miss Seven heard this, her expression became distressed, but she still held onto her last shred of hope. She looked at Liu Le'er with a pleading gaze.The young woman glanced at her with some reluctance and hesitantly tugged on Han Li's sleeve, opening her mouth to speak.Han Li naturally understood her thoughts and reached out to rub her head. He then indifferently swept his gaze in a certain direction outside the courtyard and calmly said, \"Don't worry. Even if I don't help, someone else will.\"When Miss Seven heard this, she was slightly startled. She clearly didn't understand the meaning behind Han Li's words.At that moment, the sound of something tearing through the air could be heard from a distance.Everyone from the Yu Clan, including Miss Seven, were alarmed and looked in the direction of the sound. Even Daoist Baishi, the black-clothed woman, and the other cultivators immediately took out their magic tools.As a result, under everyone's gazes, black objects streaked across the sky in succession and were thrown into the courtyard from outside. They fell to the ground with a plop and rolled a few times, revealing themselves to be bloody human heads.They were the black-clothed men that had previously fled. Their faces were twisted with fear.Everyone was startled, and Liu Le'er clutched Han Li's sleeves nervously.However, Han Li's expression was as calm as still water as he turned to look at a certain part of the void.A white light flashed and a white figure suddenly appeared. His clothes fluttered in the wind as he landed in the courtyard.This was a tall and beautiful woman in white clothes. She looked to be in her thirties, and she still retained her charm. She held a jet-black sword in her hand, and her entire body emitted a fierce and murderous aura that was rarely seen on women.\"Master!\" When Miss Seven saw who it was, she cried out in surprise and pounced forward.\"Menghan, I'm relieved that you're fine.\"The beautiful woman pulled Miss Seven's hand and gently stroked her hair. Her expression softened and a trace of love appeared in her eyes.When the Yu Family members heard the conversation between the two, they all heaved a sigh of relief when they knew they weren't enemies.When Bai Shi Zhenren and the black-clothed woman's expressions relaxed, they all looked at the sleeve of the beautiful woman in white.There was a small flame pattern embroidered there, exactly the same as the pattern on the token that Miss Seven had taken out earlier.Everyone immediately revealed a look of respect.Liu Le'er seemed to be a little afraid of Bai Shi Zhenren. She hid behind Han Li and tightly held onto his sleeve.\"I'm here, don't worry.\" Han Li knew what the young girl was worried about and said warmly.Liu Le 'er felt at ease when she heard that and nodded.\"Master, why are you here?\" Yu Menghan held back the tears in her eyes and asked.\"I heard that the Tengui School might be making a move on Yu Prefecture, so I immediately rushed over. However, I was blocked by the Tengui School on the way, so I was a little late. Fortunately, I wasn't really late.\"Bai Shi Zhenren said lovingly.\"This is all thanks to the protection of the Residence's Master and Brother Liu's help.Ladies and gentlemen, this is my master.Master, these four are the Residence's Master.This is Young Master Liu Shi. He was the one who killed the two Core Formation cultivators from the Tengui School and saved everyone in the Residence. \"Yu Menghan smiled and pulled Bai Shi Zhenren in front of Han Li and the others. She introduced Han Li and emphasized on her tone.Daoist Baishi and the others didn't dare to be slow and hurriedly bowed.\"Miss Seven, my real name is Han Li. Liu Shi is just an alias.\" Han Li didn't move and smiled at Yu Menghan.\"Oh, so it's like that. So it's Brother Han.\" Yu Menghan was startled.\"This servant is Leng Yan Sect's Gu Yunyue. Many thanks to Friend Han for saving my disciple's life. May I ask which sect you are from?\"Bai Shi Zhenren's expression was indifferent and his gaze was as sharp as a sword.Bai Shi Zhenren and the others felt as if their skin was being pricked by needles. Their hearts were filled with reverence and they didn't even dare to breathe loudly.The woman merely swept her gaze past White Stone, Liu Le'er, and the others before her gaze settled on Han Li. The indifferent expression on her face slowly disappeared and was replaced by a solemn one.Han Li's aura was faintly discernible. Even with her divine sense, she couldn't see through it. This made her heart tremble.\"Han doesn't belong to any sect. He's just a Rogue Cultivator.The reason why I helped Miss Seven just now was because I owed her a favor. Courtesy demands reciprocation. \"Han Li's expression was calm.With his powerful divine sense, he could naturally see through the other party's background. He was a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator.\"So Friend Han is a Rogue Cultivator \u2026\" The beautiful woman was a little surprised. After all, to be able to kill two Core Formation Cultivators, his cultivation level shouldn't be low. However, there were very few Nascent Soul Stage cultivators and above among Rogue Cultivators.\"Menghan, Toyokuni is now in the Tengui School's sphere of influence. We can't stay here for long. We must leave immediately.\" Gu Yunyue saw that Han Li didn't want to say much, so she nodded at him and instructed Yu Menghan.The Yu Family members didn't want to stay here. Hearing this, they all revealed a happy expression.\"Master, wait a moment. There's something I need to tell you.\" Yu Menghan suddenly opened her mouth and pulled Gu Yunyue to the side of the Evil Youth's corpse.\"Eh!Qi Minghao!Why is he here! \"The beautiful woman let out a light cry and her expression changed.\"Master, you also know this person?Is his great uncle really an elder of the Tengui School? \"Yu Menghan saw Gu Yunyue's expression and her heart jumped.\"That's right.His great uncle, Qi Xuan, is an elder of the Tengui School. His cultivation level has already reached the Spirit Severing Stage. This person is extremely protective. If he knew that his nephew was killed, I'm afraid he wouldn't let it go. \"Gu Yunyue said slowly.\"Spirit Severing Stage!\" Yu Menghan's expression changed greatly and she took a deep breath.Bai Shi Zhenren and the others' faces were filled with indescribable fear.A great cultivator of the Spirit Severing Stage was an existence that far surpassed the Nascent Soul Stage. A single finger could crush them.\"Who killed Qi Minghao?\" Gu Yunyue asked as she looked at Han Li.At this time, Han Li actually walked slowly to the body of the grey clothed man. He casually picked up a storage bag and casually checked the contents.\"It was indeed Brother Han who killed this person.\" Yu Menghan saw this and nodded.Hearing this, the beautiful woman's expression changed several times.\"Master, will Qi Xuan be angry about the death of his nephew and personally take action?\" Yu Menghan asked anxiously.\"Qi Xuan holds a high position in the Tengui School and he has many children. He won't easily leave the sect for a nephew. At most, he will send his disciples to investigate this matter.\" Gu Yunyue pondered for a moment and said while shaking her head.Hearing this, Yu Menghan's expression relaxed.\"Even so, we can't be careless. Menghan, you must immediately leave with me. We must return to the Leng Yan Sect before the people sent by Qi Xuan arrive.\" Gu Yunyue then said solemnly.Yu Menghan's expression changed slightly. It seemed that the beautiful woman only planned to take her away. She hurriedly said, \"Master, then can my family members also be brought to the Leng Yan Sect?\"Hearing this, everyone in the Yu Family looked at Gu Yunyue.Bai Shi and the other elders also looked at Gu Yunyue with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"No way.How can my Cold Flame Sect allow mortals to live in it? The rest of the Yu Residence will be escorted by these few priests to the State of Xi to hide and live in seclusion. \"Gu Yunyue shook her head and flatly refused.The State of Xi was another secular country to the northeast of Toyokuni. It was still within the Leng Yan Sect's sphere of influence.The few Yu Prefecture people were disappointed, but they didn't dare to say \"no\" in front of Gu Yunyue.The Yu Family people were also shocked and looked at Yu Menghan with pleading eyes.\"If the people from the Tengui School find us again, won't we be dead?Seventh Sister, you've entered the sect, you can't ignore us \u2026 \"Second Young Master Yu shouted anxiously.\"Shut up!\" Yu Menghan's face darkened and shouted.Second Young Master Yu's body trembled and he swallowed the words he was about to say.\"Master, is it really okay to send them to the State of Xi?The Tengui School should be able to find them easily. \"Although Yu Menghan was scolding Second Young Master Yu, she was also worried about the safety of the people in the residence.\"Disciple, don't worry.According to the rules of the Spirit Huan Domain, as long as you can officially become an inner disciple of the Leng Yan Sect, the Tengui School won't do anything to your people in the secular world. Otherwise, it would be a violation of the taboo of this domain.If they dare to kill your family, you will have an excuse to attack the people of the Tengui School after you become successful in your cultivation.The reason why they attacked Yu Prefecture before was because they pretended not to know that you have the welcoming order of the sect.Now that I have officially appeared, the situation is naturally different.The key now is whether you can safely reach the Leng Yan Sect. \"Gu Yunyue said with a serious expression.Hearing this, Yu Menghan's face relaxed.The other people in Yu Prefecture also felt relieved and didn't say anything else.\"Reverend, Reverend Wang, Reverend Sha, and Reverend Lin, please take care of my relatives.In the future, when I become successful in my cultivation, I won't forget you guys. \"Yu Menghan bowed towards Bai Shi Zhenren and the black-clothed woman.\"Miss Seven's words are too serious. Prime Minister Yu and the Young Miss have always treated us well. Now that Yu Prefecture is facing a calamity, it's our duty to protect the Yu Family.\" The black-robed woman and the others naturally agreed and promised that they would take good care of the Yu Family.Although they couldn't enter the Leng Yan Sect, Yu Menghan would still be an inner disciple of the Leng Yan Sect. As long as they could form a relationship with her, it would be beneficial for them in the future.Bai Shi Zhenren revealed a trace of embarrassment, and subconsciously stole a glance at Han Li.\"Fellow Daoist White Stone, you've stayed in Yu Prefecture for so long, it's only right that you follow them.\"Han Li, who was playing with the storage bag, looked up at Bai Shi Zhenren and said with a smile that wasn't a smile.Bai Shi Zhenren then forced a smile and agreed.\"Menghan thanks the four of you.\" Yu Menghan acted as if she didn't see any of this and bowed towards them again.After the matter was settled, the Yu Family immediately began to pack up and took out all the treasures in the residence.Han Li casually stuffed the storage pouch into his robes and walked over to the corpse of the young man with the Nefarious Qi and took out the other storage pouch.As for the things on the bodies of the black-robed men, he didn't even bother to pick them up.When Bai Shi Zhenren and the others saw this, they were naturally overjoyed and picked up the things that the black-robed men had scattered.\"What does Friend Han plan to do next?\" Gu Yunyue walked over and asked slowly.\"Han came to Mingyuan City by accident. Now that I've provoked the Tengui School, I naturally have to stay far away.\" Han Li replied indifferently.\"Fellow Daoist got involved in this mess and killed Qi Minghao. I'm afraid that it won't be easy for you to get away now.With the power of the Tengui School, they'll quickly find out who you are. \"Gu Yunyue chuckled and said.\"Fairy Gu, what do you mean?\" Han Li's expression didn't change.\"If Friend Han doesn't mind, how about joining my Leng Yan Sect?My Leng Yan Sect has always welcomed strong Rogue Cultivators to join. With the strength to easily kill a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator, it's completely possible for you to become our Outer Sect's Guest Elder. I'm willing to recommend you. \"Gu Yunyue stared at Han Li and said.\"Master is right.If Big Brother Han can join the Leng Yan Sect, it will also be of great benefit to Little Sister Le Er. \"Yu Menghan's heart moved when she heard this and said.Han Li looked at the young girl beside him and revealed a look of contemplation.Le Er blinked her big black and white eyes and seemed to be at a loss.\"If I'm not wrong, Friend Han's breath is unstable and he seems to be injured.I just happened to bring a 'Horoscope Pill', which is a very famous healing medicine in the Spirit Huan Domain. \"Gu Yunyue said meaningfully.For this woman, two Core Formation cultivators from the Tengui School died this time, and it even involved the descendants of Soul Formation cultivators. On the way to the Leng Yan Sect, they would most likely be intercepted and killed by the strong enemies of the Tengui School.Although the Youth in front of her looked mysterious, if they could go together, he would definitely be a great help.\"Le Er, are you willing to go with me to the Leng Yan Sect?\" Han Li touched his chin and suddenly asked Le Er.With Gu Yunyue's cultivation level, Le Er's fox demon identity was naturally unable to be concealed.However, he had previously soul-searched Bai Shi Zhenren and found out that although the Spirit Huan Domain was very estranged between humans and demons, in some big sects, it was common for cultivators with high cultivation levels to bring some demons with them. Bringing Liu Le Er to the Leng Yan Sect was not a problem.\"I'll listen to Big Brother.\" Liu Le Er looked at Gu Yunyue and then at Yu Menghan and said shyly.\"Don't worry, with me here, no one will dare to bully you.\" Han Li smiled and patted the young girl's head.\"I know that Big Brother will protect me.\" The young girl nodded her head and smiled.\"Then I'll have to trouble Fairy Gu to introduce Han to me. However, can you give me that 'Horoscope Pill'?\" Han Li looked at Gu Yunyue and said bluntly.\"Of course, no problem.\"Gu Yunyue was overjoyed. Without hesitation, she took out a white jade bottle and handed it over.Han Li took the jade bottle, opened the lid and sniffed it before nodding his head.Seeing this, Gu Yunyue revealed a smile.The Yu Family had already packed up. Other than a large amount of treasures, they even brought out a few horse carriages.Bai Shi Zhenren and the rest also walked over.\"Senior Han, I \u2026\" Bai Shi Taoist walked to Han Li's side and hesitated to say something.\"Just protect the Yu Family and don't worry about anything else. Also, I have something for you to do \u2026\"Han Li raised his hand to stop him from speaking. Then his lips moved slightly and he transmitted something.Bai Shi Taoist was startled and nodded his head.At this time, Yu Menghan came to Gu Yunyue's side and said softly:\"Master, the city gate is closed. I'll have to trouble you to send them out of the city.\"Gu Yunyue nodded and waved her sleeve.Suddenly, a large amount of white fog appeared out of nowhere and condensed into a huge white cloud, carrying everyone up into the sky.Most of the Yu Family had never experienced such a magical thing before. They quickly grabbed the horse carriages beside them and some of the more timid ones exclaimed.In the blink of an eye, the white cloud flew out of the city and steadily landed on the official road outside the city.\"Mother, Auntie \u2026\" Even though Yu Menghan was prepared, she was still sad and hugged her family tightly.Mama Yu and the rest also had tears in their eyes and gently told Yu Menghan to take care of herself.After a while, they reluctantly parted.Bai Shi Zhenren and the other three escorted the Yu Family to the east and quickly disappeared into the night.Yu Menghan stared blankly at her family leaving. After a long time, she withdrew her gaze and sighed softly.\"Let's hurry up.\" Gu Yunyue waited for a while before waving her hand and summoning a moon white spirit boat.The spirit boat was four to five feet long and had a rather strange shape. It was shaped like a crescent moon and there was a circle of green spirit patterns engraved on the body of the boat. It emitted a faint spirit power fluctuation. It was obviously not an ordinary object.Han Li pulled Liu Le 'er onto the spirit boat. Yu Menghan took a deep breath and calmed herself down before stepping onto the flying boat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInside the Spirit Boat.Han Li sat with his legs crossed and his eyes closed as he leaned against the side of the ark. Le'er sat beside him in an obedient manner, appraising everything within the spirit ark with a curious look in her eyes. She would also occasionally glance at the scenery around them that was rapidly passing by.Gu Yunyue controlled the Spirit Boat to stand at the bow and whispered something to Yu Menghan.After a long time, Han Li let out a sigh of relief and slowly opened his eyes. His face was a little gloomy.After he woke up, he found that he couldn't absorb the Heaven Earth Essence Qi into his body, let alone directly recover his spiritual power. At that time, he had just recovered his Divine Sense and was shocked by the loss of his memory, so he didn't have time to carefully investigate this matter.Now he tried again and found that it was the same as before.After a brief pause for contemplation, Han Li flipped a hand over to produce a white jade vial. As soon as he opened the vial, an extremely rich medicinal aroma wafted toward him, making him feel slightly invigorated.He poured out a green pill, held it between two fingers, and brought it close to his eyes to take a good look.\"This is the Wangxi Pill?I hope it really has some use. \"Han Li murmured. He raised his hand and put the pill into his mouth. He then closed his eyes and adjusted his breath.Seeing this, Liu Le'Er didn't disturb him. Seeing that Yu Menghan had finished talking with Gu Yunyue and was walking towards her, she got up and greeted her. They sat on the other side of the Spirit Boat and whispered to each other.A short moment later, as the medicinal power gradually spread through his body, Han Li raised his eyebrows. A warm current slowly flowed out from his Dantian before flowing through his limbs and meridians.After one cycle, he only felt a lot more comfortable. The empty feeling in his body also changed a little. There was a trace of spiritual power in his dantian. Although it was insignificant, it made him a little happy.Han Li slowly opened his eyes and clenched his fists that rested on his knees. He felt around for a moment before he flipped his palm and a dozen pills appeared in his palm.Other than the elixirs he got from Bai Shi Zhenren, there were also some that he got from Qi Minghao and the grey-robed man. Almost all of them were used to heal wounds and restore mana. The quality of the elixirs varied, and they were far inferior to the Pill of Foresight.Han Li picked one up and put it into his mouth. Then, he slowly closed his eyes.However, after a moment, his eyes suddenly opened and a look of confusion appeared on his face. He then picked up another pill and swallowed it.After a while, he opened his eyes again, and his gaze flickered.Just now, when the two pills entered his stomach, it was like a clay ox entering the sea. There was not even the slightest sound. He could not feel the accumulation of medicinal power, nor did he feel the slightest bit of magic power being produced.Han Li's expression turned solemn as he swallowed the pills in his hand one by one.Very quickly, the only thing left in his palm was a dark gold pill the size of a thumb.This pill's rank was not low. It was about the same as the Pill of Foresight. He guessed that it was Qi Minghao's life-saving pill.Han Li looked at the pill expressionlessly and tossed it into his mouth.This time, he was not disappointed. The medicinal power of the golden pill slowly dissolved like before, turning into a wisp of spiritual power and flowing into his Dantian, slowly increasing his magic power.Only then did Han Li's expression relax.As long as the elixirs were effective, it would not be difficult to restore his spiritual power.As for the other elixirs that did not work, it was most likely because their rank was too low and the medicinal power was not strong enough.At this moment, a deep voice suddenly sounded in his mind.\"Congratulations, Friend Han. There is hope for you to restore your spiritual power.\"\"It's just a tree without roots and water without a source!\" Han Li smiled bitterly and replied.\"It's better than nothing. The more spiritual power Friend Han recovers, the more hope you and I have to return to the Realm of Immortals.\" Magic Light said indifferently.\"That's true, but I'm afraid it won't be that easy.\" Han Li replied slowly.\"If the elixirs are like this, what about the spirit stones?\" Magic Light asked again.\"Even if you don't say it, I still want to give it a try.\" Han Li smiled and replied.Then, he turned his palm and a few green spirit stones of different sizes appeared in his palm. He clenched his fist and the spirit stones immediately lit up with a faint green light.When Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan saw the green light on Han Li's side, they couldn't help but look at it. Gu Yunyue, who was standing at the bow of the ship, did not have the slightest reaction.The green spiritual power slowly flowed out from the spirit stones. After circling around Han Li's palm for a while, it gradually became hazy and vague.After a while, the green light gradually dissipated and disappeared in the air.Han Li let go of the spirit stones that had become dim in his hand. His eyes were hesitant and he fell into contemplation.\"What's going on, the spirit stones can't be absorbed?\" Magic Light's voice sounded in Han Li's head again.After a moment of silence, Han Li replied, \"Maybe it's the same as the elixirs. These spirit stones are of too low grade and the spiritual power they contain is not pure enough, so they can't be converted into spiritual power.\"\"If that's the case, as long as there are a lot of high grade elixirs and the best quality spirit stones, then it's just a matter of time before you recover your strength.\" Magic Light said after a moment of silence.\"It's not that simple.Whether the best quality spirit stones are useful or not, we can only know after trying.Fortunately, my physical body and spiritual sense foundation are still stable. Even if I can't absorb the world's essence, I can slowly recover on my own. \"Han Li let out a long breath and said with some depression.\"Friend Han is too modest. From what I have seen in the past, if your physical body and spiritual sense foundation is only stable, then there are not many people in this world that can be regarded as incomparably strong.Since there is a direction, I only hope that you can recover soon. \"Magic Light said leisurely, then no longer spoke.Han Li sighed. There was no best quality spirit stone in the storage bag he picked up before, otherwise he would have tried it directly.He carefully checked the spiritual power in his body again and found that it was now equivalent to the middle stage of the Nascent Soul stage of an ordinary cultivator. If he wanted to continue to improve, he could either absorb the world's essence again or directly swallow high grade elixirs to restore spiritual power.Han Li thought of this and frowned. He couldn't help but sink his spiritual sense into the depths of his dantian and directly look inside his body.He saw that his entire dantian seemed to be shrouded in an endless thick fog. In the depths of the thick fog, there was a thin layer of golden light, like a yellow lamp in the night.Han Li projected his spiritual sense inside and saw a small person with a golden body exuding light sitting in the thick fog. Its appearance and demeanor were exactly the same as Han Li's. It was his Nascent Soul.The Nascent Soul's expression was calm. Its eyes were slightly closed and its hands were hanging by its side as if it was sleeping.The reason he couldn't absorb the world's essence into his body was naturally related to the appearance of the Nascent Soul.When he first woke up, he used his spiritual sense to sweep it, but found that his spiritual sense couldn't enter the Nascent Soul, let alone awaken it.If it weren't for the faint spiritual connection deep in his heart with the Nascent Soul, he would almost think that his Nascent Soul had become an external object.At this moment, all types of secret techniques were rapidly flashing through Han Li's mind. In the end, he made a hand seal, and the remaining magic power in his dantian surged before transforming into a series of silver runes that slowly adhered themselves to his Nascent Soul.\"Puff puff\", a few muffled sounds were heard.As soon as the silver rune touched the skin of the small golden person, it burst into silver light and dissipated.Han Li's face sank, but he didn't feel too surprised. He immediately changed the gesture in his heart. Traces of milky white light appeared around the small golden person in his dantian and slowly entangled the small person \u2026A few hours later.Han Li opened his eyes and took a deep breath, swallowing the mouthful of blood that had welled up in his throat.Just now, he didn't hesitate to cast the Spirit Refinement Technique, the Celestial Realm mystic technique, and forcibly used his spiritual sense to invade the body of the Nascent Soul. As a result, a terrifying power was vaguely emitted from the Nascent Soul. It actually caused his spiritual sense to suddenly rebound, and his spiritual power was reversed, causing him to suffer from the mystic technique's backlash.This was also because his physical body and spiritual sense were tyrannical enough. If it was someone else who encountered this, their meridians would be broken, and if it was serious, they would really become an idiot under the backlash of spiritual sense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust as Han Li was struggling to think of a solution, Gu Yunyue, who was standing at the bow of the ship, felt the fluctuation of Fa Li's Fa Li that he didn't conceal because of the backlash of his cultivation method. She was shocked.\"It really is the middle stage of Nascent Soul!\" She murmured. After a slight hesitation, she turned around and walked over.When Han Li saw this, he stood up with a solemn expression.\"It seems that the Wangxi Pill is quite useful to Friend Han. Fellow's injuries are almost healed.\" Gu Yunyue's expression was no longer cold as she said gently.\"This is all thanks to Fellow's spirit pill.\" Han Li also replied politely.\"Friend Han is too polite. When Fellow really joins our sect, there will naturally be other spirit pills for you.\" Gu Yunyue waved her hand.In the following time, the woman seemed to have the intention to rope in Han Li. She constantly found some topics to chat with him, trying to close the distance between them.Han Li also learned a bit more about the situation in the Spirit Huan Realm from him.After all, his understanding of this domain was limited to the knowledge of a Core Formation Stage cultivator like Bai Shi Taoist. Compared to the information provided by a Nascent Soul cultivator, there was naturally some difference.As for the young woman's casual questions about his background, he vaguely brushed them off.The young woman saw that Han Li didn't want to reveal too much, so she tactfully didn't ask anymore.\"Oh right, Fellow Gu, I wonder if you can tell me about the situation of the Leng Yan Sect?After all, Han's understanding of your sect is limited to some rumors in the outside world. \"Han Li suddenly asked.\"Hehe, even if Friend Han didn't ask, I would still tell you in detail.\" Gu Yunyue was a little surprised, but she immediately replied.\"My Leng Yan Sect is a famous sect in the Spirit Huan Domain. It has been established for millions of years, and there are hundreds of thousands of disciples in the sect.Not to mention the Core Formation Stage and Nascent Soul Stage, there are dozens of Soul Formation Stage and Void Refinement Stage elders. Above them, there are three Integration Stage cultivators and a Mahayana Stage ancestor. \"Speaking of this, Gu Yunyue's expression was full of pride.When Han Li heard this, his heart skipped a beat.With a Mahayana Realm cultivator, the Leng Yan Sect was indeed powerful, almost comparable to a major clan in the Spirit Realm.\"The founder of my sect, the Ancestor of the Cold Flame, ascended to the Immortal Realm a million years ago. Even today, our sect can still communicate with this Ancestor through a special method. He will give us some Immortal Pills and Cultivation Methods from time to time. Our small sects can't compare with him at all. Friend Han, you won't be disappointed if you join our Leng Yan Sect.\" Gu Yunyue glanced at Han Li and said with a smile.The moment Han Li heard about immortals, his expression finally changed.The Leng Yan Sect also had a backer in the Immortal Realm!Moreover, after the Icy Flames Ancestor ascended, he would be able to contact the lower realms!He had never heard of such a thing in the Spiritual Realm.From the looks of it, the situation in the Spirit Huan Realm was really very different from the Spirit Realm.Seeing the change in Han Li's expression, Gu Yunyue also showed some satisfaction, and smiled without saying anything.\"I didn't expect the Leng Yan Sect to be so powerful, no wonder it can suppress the Spirit Huan Realm. I wonder what's the situation in the Tengui School?\" Han Li nodded and said.\"The Tengui School is similar to my Leng Yan Sect, they also have an ancestor who ascended to the Immortal Realm.Other than our two sects, there's also a Realm Temple that has a senior backing in the Immortal Realm. The three major sects are on equal footing in the Spirit Huan Realm. \"Gu Yunyue's smile faded, and her expression became somewhat serious.\"Although they're on equal footing, there's definitely a difference in strength. I wonder how the three major sects' strength is ranked?\" Han Li touched his chin, and suddenly asked again.\"This \u2026 The three major sects' strength is basically about the same, but the Tengui School was established much longer than our Leng Yan Sect and the Realm Temple. In history, there were three people who ascended to the Immortal Realm, and their strength was slightly higher. Our Leng Yan Sect and the Realm Temple are about the same.\" Gu Yunyue's eyes flickered slightly, and said evasively.It seemed that the Tengui School's strength was far above that of the Leng Yan Sect, but this woman just didn't want to admit it.Han Li narrowed his eyes and thought, and became a little interested in the Leng Yan Sect.Since the Leng Yan Sect could contact the people of the Immortal Realm, their foundation was definitely not shallow. Maybe they could really find a way to solve the Nascent Soul Realm.He asked some more things about the Leng Yan Sect, and then ended the conversation. He walked to the side and sat down cross-legged.Not long after, wisps of cyan light gradually appeared on his body, but the breath on his body quickly converged, and finally disappeared completely. Not a trace of spiritual power could be felt.Gu Yunyue returned to the bow and continued to control the flying boat, but after noticing the change of the spiritual power fluctuation on Han Li's body, she couldn't help but secretly wonder.The surrounding sky gradually brightened.The flying boat pierced through the clouds and mist, and a towering and dense mountain range appeared in front of it. The mountain range was straight and dark red. Looking from the sky, it looked like a huge red forest.Gu Yunyue saw the red mountain range in front of her, and she couldn't help but feel relieved.This mountain range was called the Red Coral Mountain Range, and it was already the border of Toyokuni.She deliberately took a detour to avoid the easily explored area of the Tengui School. Now that she was here, it should be much safer.However, for the sake of safety, Gu Yunyue raised the flying boat a little more, and drilled into the mid-air clouds.At this moment, the clouds in the sky weren't dense, but passing through the clouds could still play a role in concealing one's tracks.Yu Menghan and Liu Le'er also gradually got used to the flying boat, and they were no longer that afraid. They stood up to admire the beautiful scenery around them, and from time to time, a few melodious laughter could be heard.The mountain range below quickly retreated, and a moment later, a plain appeared in the distance. Gu Yunyue's last trace of worry was slowly put down.\"Be careful!\"Han Li, who had been sitting quietly with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes and shouted in a low voice.When Le'er and Yu Menghan heard Han Li's words, they were startled.Gu Yunyue's expression suddenly changed, and without saying anything, she formed a seal with both hands, and a thick white light shot out from each of her palms into the flying boat.The Spirit Moon Flying Ship shone brightly and suddenly stopped. Then, it shot back at an incomparably fast speed.At this moment, a white cloud in front of them suddenly turned black, and turned into an incomparably huge black sinister ghost face. It opened its mouth and bit down, but the Spirit Moon Flying Boat suddenly flew back, and the ghost face bit empty air.\"Yi!\" A light sound of surprise came from the ghost face.The ghost face swayed, and with a loud bang, it collapsed into a black cloud, and under a blur, two figures appeared.The person on the left was a hunchbacked old man. His face was full of wrinkles, and there were a few sparse yellow hair on his head. He had the appearance of a dying tree.The person on the right was a Youth. He had a horse face, a big mouth, and was extremely ugly. A pair of triangular eyes flickered with an ominous light.Both of them wore black robes with a sinister ghost head pattern embroidered on them. They faintly emitted traces of black gas, and the spiritual pressure they emitted had reached the Nascent Soul Stage.The horse-faced Youth was the same as Gu Yunyue, mid Nascent Soul Stage. The hunchbacked old man's cultivation was even higher, at late Nascent Soul Stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Hehe, I didn't expect Fellow Gu Yunyue to know our names, it's really an honor.\" The old man's voice was extremely hoarse, as if two pieces of iron were rubbing against each other.The horse-faced Youth was silent. His slightly red eyes slowly looked at Han Li and the others. When he saw Yu Menghan and Liu Le 'er, his eyes lit up and he stuck out his tongue to lick his thick lips.Liu Le 'er hurriedly hid behind Han Li.Seeing this, Yu Menghan also felt a chill in her heart.Gu Yunyue's heart was in a mess. Although she guessed that the Tengui School wouldn't let the matter of Yu Prefecture go, she didn't expect the pursuers to arrive so quickly. Moreover, the pursuers were these two fierce and troublesome people.But after all, she was also a cultivator who had experienced many battles. She quickly regained her composure and said coldly, \"The two of you suddenly attacked me at the border. You should give me an explanation right? Could it be that you want to start a war between our sects?\"\"Hehe, let's not beat around the bush. I believe Fellow Gu already knows why we're here.The two of us were ordered by Elder Qi to take away Martial Nephew Qi's murderer as well as this little girl surnamed Yu. \"The hunchbacked old man let out a strange laugh and casually glanced at Han Li and Yu Menghan.Han Li stood still with a calm expression. Yu Menghan's pretty face turned pale.Gu Yunyue snorted. She didn't reply immediately, but her mind was spinning rapidly.\"Fellow Daoist Gu, there is no enmity between you and us brothers. As long as you hand over these two people, we brothers guarantee that you will be able to leave safely. How about it?\" The hunchbacked old man shook his head as he spoke. He was like an old man from the mortal world.Gu Yunyue's position in the Leng Yan Sect wasn't low. If they could, they didn't want to fight with her.\"Friend Han is now our sect's outer court guest elder, and Yu Menghan is also our sect's inner court disciple. You want me to hand them over? What do you think the Leng Yan Sect is?\" Gu Yunyue's face suddenly became cold, and she said resolutely.\"Hmph, you refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. Since you're courting death, then us brothers will send you on your way!\" The hunchbacked old man's eyebrows suddenly rose as he spoke in a cold voice.The Horse-faced Youth had been waiting impatiently for a long time. Seeing that the negotiation had failed, he immediately made the first move. With a wave of his sleeve, a large amount of greyish-white flames swarmed out from his sleeve.With a point of his finger, the greyish-white flames immediately converged to form a greyish-white flame vortex.A house-sized flaming ghost claw suddenly stretched out from the whirlpool, grabbing towards Gu Yunyue and the others.Gu Yunyue, who was already prepared, stomped her foot, and the Spirit Moon Flying Ship shone brightly again as it flew backward.At the same time, she raised her hand, and the black long sword beside her immediately flew out. It turned into a seven-feet-long sword rainbow, and slashed at the flaming ghost claw's palm. Unexpectedly, a sound of metal clashing was heard.Gu Yunyue's eyes slightly moved, and her fingers changed their gestures.The black sword rainbow suddenly shrank, and became more than twice its original size. However, it became even brighter and more dazzling.\"Puchi!\"The black sword rainbow impressively pierced through the flaming ghost claw, and came out from the other side.The ghost claw exploded with a bang, and turned into remnant flames that filled the sky. The flame vortex in the sky also subsequently collapsed.The Horse-faced Youth's face turned red, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.He roared, and his eyes suddenly became blood-red. He turned his hand, and took out a black scroll. It seemed as if it was a picture scroll.A large amount of greyish-white light gushed out from his body, and immediately wrapped his figure. From the outside, it was impossible to see what he was doing inside.The hunchbacked old man also stamped his foot, and a large amount of ink-black light emerged from his body. The enormous coercion of the Late Nascent Soul Stage spread out.Gu Yunyue's complexion slightly changed, and she waved her hand to recall the black sword rainbow. It hovered above her head, and her Divine Sense tightly locked onto the Horse-faced Youth and the hunchbacked old man.The Spirit Moon Flying Ship took advantage of this opportunity to retreat more than a thousand feet in a single breath. Then, it stopped.\"Friend Han, these two people have been famous for a long time, and their strength is extremely strong. If the situation turns bad, you take my disciple and escape first. I will bring up the rear.\" The young woman quickly transmitted her voice to Han Li.Although she had unexpectedly defeated the Horse-faced Youth, she was also aware that she was no match for the hunchbacked old man. Moreover, Han Li's strength was unknown. Even if the two of them joined hands, they might not be able to obtain an advantage over the other party. Therefore, she had long since wanted to escape.Han Li stood there quietly, and didn't speak. He had a noncommittal look on his face.At this moment, a gloomy voice sounded in the woman's ears.\"Want to escape? Can you escape?\"Gu Yunyue's heart suddenly shuddered.With a \"pu\" sound, the black light around the hunchbacked old man suddenly exploded. His figure blurred within the black light, turning into a grey skeleton.Gu Yunyue was startled when she saw this, and Han Li's eyes also flickered.At this moment, the space above the Spirit Moon Flying Ship suddenly fluctuated violently. A beam of black light suddenly burst out from within, and the figure of the hunchbacked old man appeared out of thin air.He waved his hands, and golden light flashed in front of him. A giant golden pagoda that was over 100 feet tall appeared out of thin air, and fiercely smashed down towards the Spirit Moon Flying Ship.A terrifying pressure crashed down, and the light on the surface of the flying ship violently fluctuated. It looked as if it would immediately shatter.Gu Yunyue let out a muffled snort, and her hands formed a series of hand seals at lightning speed. A series of sword arts submerged into the black longsword above her head.The black longsword trembled violently, and countless dense sword shadows appeared, chopping down towards the giant pagoda.Rumble!Countless sounds of explosions rang out!The dense sword shadows chopped down on the giant pagoda, but they immediately shattered and disappeared, not leaving the slightest trace on the pagoda.However, the momentum of the giant pagoda also paused for a moment.Gu Yunyue took this opportunity to shout, and a silver-white light flew out from her hand. It was a silver embroidered handkerchief. With a whoosh, it wildly expanded in the wind, and blossomed with dazzling silver light.Phantoms of mountains and rivers faintly appeared on the surface of the embroidered handkerchief. They swallowed and spat out astonishing Spiritual Qi, and blocked the giant pagoda's downward momentum.Gu Yunyue's tense expression relaxed, and a cold light flickered in her eyes. She formed a sword art and pointed.The black flying sword immediately revolved, and black light shined brightly. It suddenly expanded, and in the blink of an eye, it turned into a giant black sword that was 50 or 60 feet long, and chopped down towards the hunchbacked old man with incomparable speed.The old man sneered, and waved his hand to shoot out a spell art.The bottom of the giant golden pagoda rumbled, and a black hole appeared. Dazzling golden light spurted out from it, and formed a huge golden halo.A terrifying suction force suddenly emerged from it, and the airflow within a radius of several hundred feet began to reverse.The giant black sword immediately stopped as if it was bearing a heavy burden. Then, it revolved in the air, and flew towards the round hole at the bottom of the giant golden pagoda.Gu Yunyue desperately formed a spell in an attempt to stabilize the giant sword. But, it didn't have the slightest effect. In just two or three breaths, the giant sword was still sucked into the giant pagoda.Gu Yunyue's complexion turned pale, and her connection with the black flying sword was thoroughly severed.The golden light emitted by the giant golden pagoda became even more dazzling, and it issued a rumbling sound as it pressed down.The silver embroidered handkerchief faintly caved in, and the phantoms of mountains and rivers on its surface twisted and deformed under the suction force of the golden pagoda. It seemed as if they were also going to be sucked into the giant pagoda.Gu Yunyue hastily formed a spell, and held the embroidered handkerchief with both hands. Then, she madly poured her magic power into the handkerchief.The mountain and river patterns on the surface of the handkerchief radiated a bright silver light, and issued bursts of whistling sounds. Then, it finally stabilized again.The hunchbacked old man sneered, and raised his hand as if he was about to do something.Bang!A muffled sound came from afar, and the greyish-white light around the Horse-Faced Youth's body burst open. Then, his figure appeared. A black picture scroll was floating in front of him. It was the same one that he had taken out before. But, it had already been unfolded, and its surface was densely covered with the patterns of a hundred ghosts. It was exuding an intense black light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, his eyes never left Gu Yunyue.At the same time, the horse-faced Youth took out a black dagger and slashed his arm.A large amount of blood gushed out and turned into a thick blood mist that merged with the Hundred Ghosts Painting.The black gas emitted by the black painting suddenly thickened and gusts of cold wind appeared out of nowhere. Ghostly wails and wolf howls resounded. It was extremely frightening.Roar roar!Two ferocious ghosts jumped out of the painting and grew to four to five feet in size.The upper bodies of these two ghosts were shaped like apes with short, dark green hair. Their mouths were filled with snow white fangs that protruded out of their mouths. Their arms were thick and strong and their ten fingers had bloody red claws that were a foot long.Their lower bodies were shrouded by a black fog as if they had no physical body.The cold wind around the painting grew stronger and the black gas rolled. Ferocious ghosts flew out one after another.In the blink of an eye, hundreds of ghosts appeared.Most of them were at the Foundation Establishment Stage. However, there were five or six ghosts that were obviously larger in size and emitted the aura of Core Formation Stage.\"Kill!\" The horse-faced Youth sneered and pointed at Gu Yunyue and the others.Roar roar roar!Hundreds of ghosts pounced towards the Flying Moon Spirit Ship with an imposing manner.Gu Yunyue's expression changed drastically as she withdrew her hands from the silver handkerchief and patted the storage pouch on her waist. Four streaks of white light flew out from the storage pouch and landed around her, revealing themselves to be humanoid white jade puppets that were around 10 feet tall. Each of them wore a suit of armor and held a large white flag that was flashing with spiritual light.The four puppets waved the large flag in their hands and a brilliant white light emitted from their bodies. The light quickly connected with each other and formed a white magic array that enveloped the Flying Moon Spirit Ship inside.The moment the magic array was formed, the hundreds of ghosts rushed over and surrounded the white magic array.Roar roar!These ferocious ghosts roared and clawed as they attacked the white magic array with all their might.The few completion levelled ghosts, in particular, were spitting out rays of green light that landed on the array.The white magic array immediately shook violently.Gu Yunyue hurriedly formed a hand seal, and rays of white light fell on the four puppets. Only then did the array gradually stabilize.The Horse-faced Youth's figure flickered, and he also flew near the white spell formation. He muttered an incantation, and a large amount of greyish-white flames appeared on his body again, forming a sea of fire that was dozens of feet wide.He made a grabbing motion in the air, and a small piece of the greyish-white flames in the sea of flames immediately separated, condensing into two flame spears that were several tens of feet long.With a wave of his arm, the flaming spear immediately shot out like a bolt of lightning, emitting an ear-piercing screech as it ruthlessly stabbed into the white spell formation.Boom! Boom! Boom!The Fire Spear shattered, but the white spell formation also shook violently. Even Gu Yunyue's body shook, and her complexion turned pale.The horse-faced Youth sneered as he hurled fire spears from his hand, bombarding the magic formation one after another.The originally seventy to eighty feet white magic circle shook violently, and its light quickly dimmed and shrunk. Not long after, it had shrunk to less than thirty feet.Gu Yunyue's complexion became paler, and fine beads of sweat seeped out of her forehead. Her body trembled slightly.In the sky above the spell formation, the hunchbacked old man saw Gu Yunyue's current expression, and laughed heartily. He patted the storage bag on his waist, and twelve black lights flew out of it. They were twelve bone tridents.The bone tridents expanded in the wind, and their surface rose up with pitch-black flames. They emitted a bone-chilling aura as they flew down towards the white spell formation.Qi Xuan had ordered the two of them to come here, and whoever could kill Gu Yunyue would naturally make a great contribution.Gu Yunyue was now an arrow at the end of its flight, and the hunchbacked old man immediately moved to snatch the credit.The horse-faced Youth was furious in his heart, but the hunchbacked old man's cultivation was higher than his, so he could only swallow his anger.Gu Yunyue couldn't help but reveal a trace of despair in her eyes as she saw this scene.But at this moment, a figure soared from the spirit boat, and in a flash, directly passed through the white spell formation, and appeared in the air outside. It was Han Li.His figure flashed left and right, and suddenly transformed into a few afterimages. Then, they quickly combined into one.The twelve bone tridents that had shot down mysteriously disappeared.The hunchbacked old man's eyes narrowed, and his complexion changed greatly.Han Li slowly spread out his hands in the air, and the twelve bone tridents were impressively in his hands. He then rubbed his hands together, and the black flames on the twelve bone tridents collapsed, revealing their original bodies.He looked at these bone tridents, and waved his hand to put them away. From beginning to end, his face was expressionless, as if he had done a trivial thing.\"You, you \u2026\" The hunchbacked old man pointed at Han Li, and was shocked and angry at the same time.The ghost creatures smelled the breath of a living person on Han Li's body, and immediately abandoned the white spell formation, and rushed towards him, their mouths emitting excited roars.\"Noisy!\"Han Li frowned, and his figure flashed again, turning into a blurry green shadow, and rushed into the crowd of ghosts.Wherever the green shadow passed, the ghosts were like waves crashing into a reef, directly exploding and shattering into pieces.In the blink of an eye, nearly a hundred ghosts were killed by the green shadow with the momentum of the autumn wind sweeping away the fallen leaves.The horse-faced Youth was dumbfounded, and he looked at everything in front of him in a daze.A figure flashed, and Han Li appeared in front of him, and blasted a punch.\"Boom!\"The horse-faced Youth didn't have time to scream, and his body directly burst into pieces of flesh. Even the Original Soul hiding inside was not spared.\"Not good!\"The hunchbacked old man saw this, and hurriedly waved his sleeves, and a dense number of green flying needles emerged. There were hundreds of them, and each of them was a foot long. They were as thin as hair, and they were burning with green flames.The sky full of fine needles flew towards Han Li like rain, making a dense \"Chi Chi\" sound.Almost at the same time, the surface of the old man's body emitted a rolling green flame. He turned around and flew into the distance, even abandoning the giant golden tower.Han Li saw this, and didn't move. He opened his mouth and suddenly took a deep breath.\"Boom!\"A huge suction suddenly appeared in the void in front of him, and the airflow within a hundred feet was reversed, and the space was buzzing incessantly.The flying needles were immediately swept away by the suction, like the autumn wind sweeping away the fallen leaves, and all of them went into Han Li's mouth.He chewed, and there was a crunching sound. He raised his head slightly and swallowed them directly.Gu Yunyue saw this scene, and her mouth opened slightly. Her whole person was stunned.Yu Menghan and Liu Le 'er on the flying boat not far away only felt that the sky was dazzled. It seemed that they didn't understand what was happening in front of them at all, and two enemies were killed and one escaped. They couldn't help but be stunned.At this time, Han Li glanced at the green light that the hunchbacked old man turned into, and his expression was indifferent. A faint golden light flashed on his arm, and he blasted out a punch.There was a sound of breaking air!The void behind the hunchbacked old man flashed, and a golden fist the size of a head flashed out, and its speed was several times faster than the old man's escape.\"Ah!\"The hunchbacked old man's face changed drastically, and his body trembled. A black light appeared on the surface of his body, but the next moment, he was hit by the golden fist.Boom!The green ghost exploded, but there was no trace of flesh and blood, only a pile of white bones scattered in the sky.At the same time, there was a fluctuation in the void dozens of miles away from here. A large black light appeared out of nowhere, and a figure staggered out of it. It was the hunchbacked old man.He looked back with a face full of horror, and once again opened his mouth to spit out a green light, which turned into a rolling green flame that wrapped around his body. He flew into the distance and disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.Han Li's divine sense had already spread out, and the situation dozens of miles away was naturally covered by his divine sense. Just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly looked down at the green light on his body, and it was obviously a little dimmer than before.Han Li's brows furrowed upon seeing this, and he gave up on the idea of continuing to pursue the horse-faced man. Instead, he waved a hand to release a burst of azure light, which swept up the horse-faced man's storage pouch before landing on the Spirit Moon Ark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This little fox girl had never seen such a battle before. Although she saw her \"Brother Stone\" easily win, she couldn't help but feel some lingering fear.Han Li gave her a warm smile and lightly shook his head, indicating that she didn't need to worry. He then put away the storage pouch in his hand.Without a master to control it, the hunchbacked old man's golden pagoda quickly shrunk and spun as it descended.Gu Yunyue waved her hand and took the golden pagoda into her hand. She looked at the nearby Han Li and saw that he didn't have any intention of stopping her. She relaxed and put the golden pagoda into the storage pouch at her waist.This golden pagoda magic treasure was quite powerful and was able to trap others. If she could take it for her own use, she would have another trump card in battle and her strength would greatly increase. However, the Wind and Cloud Twin Demons were killed by Han Li after all, so the spoils of war should belong to him. Fortunately, Han Li seemed to tacitly approve of her actions.\"Just now, it was all thanks to Friend Han's help.I originally knew that Fellow Daoist was no ordinary cultivator, but I didn't expect to greatly underestimate your strength. \"Gu Yunyue composed herself and walked in front of Han Li. Although her expression was calm, there was a trace of awe hidden in the depths of her eyes. How could it be hidden from Han Li?This woman knew that even if she were to face the horse-faced Youth alone, she wouldn't be able to kill him as easily as the person in front of her. Even his Nascent Soul wouldn't be able to escape, let alone a late Nascent Soul stage hunchbacked old man.\"Those two wanted my life, so I naturally had to send them on their way.\" Han Li said with a faint smile.Yu Menghan, who was next to Gu Yunyue, pursed her lips and revealed a bit of the charm that a young girl should have. However, when she looked at Han Li, her eyes were filled with awe and confusion.In her mind, her Shizun was a true immortal. In front of her Shizun, even Spiritual Master White Stone, who even her father had to treat with respect, did not dare to breathe too loudly. However, this tall and sturdy young man in front of her, who was dull and lifeless when she first met him, now displayed a powerful strength that even her Shizun could not hope to match.The current Han Li was like a fog to her. Although she was standing next to him, she felt as if she was separated by a galaxy.\"I thought we could avoid the Tengui School's pursuit after leaving Toyokuni. I didn't expect them to come so quickly.\" Gu Yunyue sighed.\"This is nothing. After all, this is currently the Tengui School's sphere of influence.\" Han Li said indifferently. There wasn't much worry on his face.\"As long as we enter the Leng Yan Sect's sphere of influence as soon as possible, we should be able to get rid of the Tengui School's entanglement.\"Gu Yunyue nodded, but her face suddenly stagnated slightly. She looked at Han Li with a strange gaze.Although it was just a flash, it was seen by Han Li.Han Li's expression didn't change, but he was quite depressed in his heart. In the battle just now, he only slightly activated his body protection aura, and the result was that his spiritual power fell from the Nascent Soul Intermediate Stage to the Early Stage.Gu Yunyue should have noticed the change in his aura, so he naturally wouldn't bother to explain anything.\u2026 \u2026In the depths of a cave house in the Tengui School, in a deep secret room.There were a dozen thick torches inserted on the walls of the room. The bright yellow flames trembled at the top, illuminating the entire secret room.In the middle of the secret room, in front of a round stone table, sat a skinny old man with white hair and a black beard. He was wearing an ochre robe. One of his hands was placed on the stone table, and the other hand was tapping on his knee rhythmically.The bridge of his nose was high, and his eyes were deep in his eye sockets. He stared straight ahead, and his wrinkled, thin, and long face looked gloomy under the light of the fire.And directly in front of him, a bronze mirror the size of a human head was floating in the air. The figure of a hunchbacked old man was reflected in the mirror. It was the person who survived the Wind Cloud Duo.The old man in the bronze mirror was already hunchbacked, but at this moment, he was even more hunched. His entire head was completely lowered, and he didn't dare to raise it at all.The skinny old man stopped tapping and asked, \"So, not only did you two not bring back the person for me, but you also lost one?\"His voice was abnormally hoarse and seemed very rough.The hunchbacked old man's body clearly trembled, and he hurriedly replied, \"Reporting to Martial Uncle Qi, it's not that this disciple is incompetent, but that person is simply too powerful and strange.In the beginning, he seemed to have deliberately concealed his aura and appeared to be no different from a mortal.But when he suddenly attacked, he suddenly became a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator. Before I could clearly see his movements, the twelve bone tridents were taken by him, and then \u2026 \"Before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by the skinny old man, \"His cultivation is lower than yours, but he easily took away your magic treasures?\"\"Yes \u2026 yes.Not only that, but his body is also extremely powerful. The ghosts in Junior Martial Brother's Hundred Ghost Portrait are like paper and clay statues compared to him, and they were reduced to dust by a single collision.Even the Bone Devouring Yin Needles were devoured by him, and he chewed them to pieces. \"The hunchbacked old man's body trembled, and he spoke with lingering fear in his heart.Hearing this, the skinny old man's fingers tapped his knee again, and he seemed to be deep in thought.The hunchbacked old man didn't dare to raise his head, but seeing that the skinny old man didn't speak for a long time, the fear in his heart grew. He couldn't help but kneel on the ground and say with a trembling voice,\"Martial Uncle Qi, what I said \u2026 Everything I said is true. I didn't exaggerate or lie in the slightest.\"The skinny old man was still speechless. After a while, he slowly said, \"According to what you said, this person is most likely an extremely rare high level Strength Cultivator. He is indeed not someone you can deal with.Forget it, you don't need to worry about this. \"With that, without even looking at the hunchbacked old man, he casually waved his long sleeve in the air. The image on the copper mirror immediately darkened and disappeared.\"You dared to kill my Hao 'er. So what if you're a high level Strength Cultivator?I will still tear your skin and bones apart to bury my Hao 'er's soul. \"The skinny old man suddenly sat up straight, and his expression was ferocious as he spoke through gritted teeth.After a while, his gaze once again fell on the copper mirror, and he chanted. He formed a seal with one hand and pointed at the copper mirror in the air.Suddenly, the surface of the mirror rippled like water, and then another picture was revealed.In the image, a rather sturdy middle-aged man was hovering in the air above a verdant forest. He stroked his short beard with one hand and asked with a smile, \"What do you think?He stroked his short beard and said with a smile, \"Brother Qi, we haven't seen each other for a long time. Why did you suddenly send me a message today?\"\"Brother Lu Ya, I won't be exchanging pleasantries with you today. I really have something to ask of you,\" the skinny old man said in a low and hoarse voice with a serious expression.Seeing that he wasn't joking at all, the sturdy man also stopped smiling and asked solemnly, \"What's wrong? What happened?\"The skinny old man sighed and told him everything about Qi Minghao and the Twin Killers of Wind and Cloud.\"Bastard, how dare you kill Brother Qi's descendant. You deserve to die!\" The sturdy man named Lu Ya snorted after listening to the story.\"I'm currently in the sect and can't leave for the time being. Brother Lu, you're near Toyokuni, so I hope you can kill this person on my behalf,\" the skinny old man said in a low voice.\"Strength Cultivators mainly train their bodies, and they can easily crush ordinary cultivators. However, it's extremely difficult to cultivate and break through bottlenecks.This person can cultivate to a high level, so I'm afraid he's not an ordinary person? \"Lu Ya thought for a while and asked.\"According to the disciples, this person is a new outer sect elder that the Leng Yan Sect plans to recruit. He hasn't officially entered the sect yet, so you don't have to worry too much about him.As long as you kill this person for me, I'll give you my Origin Spirit Pill as thanks. \"The skinny old man looked deeply at Lu Ya and said in a low voice.A trace of joy flashed in the sturdy man's eyes, but he quickly concealed it and said, \"Since that's the case, I'll take this person's life on behalf of Brother Qi.\"The skinny old man suddenly thought of something and said with a gloomy expression, \"That's right, don't kill that girl with the surname Yu. It's best if she can bring her to me alive.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTens of thousands of miles away from the border of Toyokuni, a spirit boat wrapped in white light streaked across the sky, heading in a certain direction.At this time, the sky was clear, and the white clouds were like cotton. It made people feel relaxed and happy. It was really beautiful, but the four people on the flying boat were obviously not in the mood to appreciate it.Han Li sat cross-legged at the back of the boat with his eyes closed. There was a faint layer of golden light flowing up and down his skin.Liu Le 'er sat close to Han Li, and green light lingered around her body. It was obvious that she was also cultivating.Gu Yunyue and Yu Menghan stood at the bow of the boat. The latter looked back at the back of the boat from time to time with a complicated expression. Gu Yunyue was controlling the flying boat with a faint smile on her face. She seemed to be in a good mood.Two days had passed since the last attack. During this time, they didn't encounter any danger. As they got closer and closer to the gate of the Leng Yan Sect, their safety was naturally getting higher and higher.After a long time, Han Li frowned and opened his eyes. The golden light on his body flashed for a while before fading away.In these two days, he tried several methods to break the seal on his nascent soul, but unfortunately, there was no progress. Instead, he consumed a lot of spiritual power.Although he found two pills similar to the \"Wangxi pill\" from the storage bag of the horse-faced Youth, he didn't know why it didn't work on him.It seemed that the situation of his body was much more complicated than expected.He shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He looked at Liu Le 'er next to him.The fluctuation of this woman's aura was much better than before. There was a faint trend of breaking through to the late stage of foundation building. This was all thanks to the bottle of pills obtained from the storage bag of the horse-faced Youth.Han Li nodded secretly. He didn't disturb her cultivation. He got up and walked to the side of the flying boat and looked outside.\"Friend Han, go all the way west from here. In less than half a month, you will arrive at the sect.At that time, the sect will arrange a good cave for you to recover from your injuries. \"Gu Yunyue walked toward the back of the boat and said with a smile.Yu Menghan followed behind her master without saying a word.Han Li nodded and said, \"Then I'll have to trouble you.\"Gu Yunyue was just about to say something when a faint rumbling sound suddenly came from the front.Han Li and the other two looked towards the source of the sound and saw that the boundary between heaven and earth had suddenly become dark. Several huge tornadoes rose into the sky, sweeping back and forth. From time to time, muffled thunderous noises could be heard from within, and the dusky yellow sand screen blocked out the sun.Gu Yunyue frowned slightly and shot out a seal to stop the Spirit Moon Flying Ship.At this time, Liu Le'er also woke up from her cultivation and walked to Han Li's side with a startled expression.\"It looks like a sandstorm. Is there anything wrong?\" Han Li looked into the distance and asked faintly.\"Friend Han, you may not know this, but the desert we are in is called the Yellow Wave Ancient Desert. There won't be a sandstorm easily. Once it appears, it will spread throughout the entire desert in a short period of time, and it will last for more than a month.\" Gu Yunyue said sternly.\"Oh, then we'll just cross it. Although the scale of this sandstorm is not small, it won't affect us much.\" Han Li frowned and said.\"There is naturally no need to worry about the sandstorm. It's just that there is an ancient strange insect called the Evil Flying Ant here. It usually hibernates in the underground of the ancient desert, but once there is a sandstorm, it will come out to wreak havoc.A single flying ant is naturally not a threat, but this insect often appears in tens of thousands, and its speed is extremely fast. Once you are entangled by it, as long as it is not a magic weapon refined by the Evil Dao, it will be corroded by the foul mist and lose a lot of its spirituality.Therefore, even if a high level cultivator encounters it, most of them will feel a headache. \"Gu Yunyue explained solemnly.\"What about taking a detour?\" Han Li heard this and asked with a slight hesitation.Right now, every bit of Fa Li he used was a bit less, and he didn't want to waste it in a place like this.\"I'm afraid it will take more than a month.\" Gu Yunyue thought about it and replied.Han Li touched his chin and remained silent.Gu Yunyue looked at Han Li and didn't say anything. It was obvious that she wanted him to decide what to do next.\"Friend Han, you don't have to worry about these flying ants. Just leave them to me.\" A voice suddenly sounded in Han Li's mind. It was Magic Light.\"Oh, you have the confidence to deal with them?\" Han Li's heart moved and asked through his mind.\"The Evil Flying Ant is an ancient strange species born from the mix of the evil energy underground and the resentment of the dead. It is quite similar to us demons from beyond the heavens. I didn't think that this Spirit Huan Realm would have it too.Although these ants are difficult to deal with, they are extremely afraid of attacks like the Soul Grasping Demon Sound. Although I don't have 90% of my supernatural powers, dealing with some trivial flying ants shouldn't be a problem at all. \"Demonshine chuckled.\"Alright, if we encounter those Evil Flying Ants, I'll leave it to you.\" Han Li thought for a while and said.\"You and I are in the same boat now, I will naturally do my best.\" After Magic Light said this without emotion, his voice gradually became silent.\"The detour is too far, let's go through the sandstorm. If we encounter those Evil Flying Ants, Han has his own way to deal with them.\" Han Li turned his head and said to Gu Yunyue without changing his expression.\"Friend Han has the confidence?\" Gu Yunyue was startled.\"What, Friend Gu doesn't trust Han?\" Han Li smiled slightly.\"I definitely don't mean that. Since Friend said so, I naturally have a card up my sleeve.\" Gu Yunyue quickly laughed and didn't say anything else. She made a gesture with her hand.The Spirit Moon Flying Ship shined brightly and condensed into a white shield. It plunged into the sandstorm in front of it.In the next moment, everyone felt that the light around them dimmed. All they could see was the roaring wind. It was mixed with a sky full of sand and fiercely bombarded the shield of the flying ship.The Spirit Moon Flying Ship immediately shook slightly.Gu Yunyue made a hand seal and shot a white light into the bow of the boat.\"Chi la\", all the inscriptions on the flying ship lit up. The white shield immediately became several times brighter. It stabilized and flew forward.At first, Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan were a little worried when they saw the roaring sandstorm outside. But as time passed, they saw that the sandstorm couldn't break through the shield of the Spirit Moon Flying Ship. Their worried hearts gradually relaxed and they enjoyed the rare strange scenery outside through the white shield.Gu Yunyue focused on controlling the flying ship and carefully avoided the tornadoes. Her speed wasn't much slower.In the blink of an eye, they flew in the sandstorm for two to four hours. Their luck wasn't bad. They didn't encounter those evil ants.Han Li had his hands behind his back. He calmly stood at the bow of the ship. But suddenly, a blue light flashed in his eyes and he glanced in a certain direction.\"Friend Han, what's wrong?\" Gu Yunyue noticed the change in Han Li's expression and was startled.\"Friend Gu, it seems that trouble has come?\" Han Li glanced at Gu Yunyue and sneered.Gu Yunyue was startled. She didn't understand what Han Li meant.Rumble!Right at this moment, a whirlwind column came rumbling towards the flying boat.This tornado was abnormally thick. It almost reached the sky. Before it arrived, a huge gust of wind swept over and almost swept the Spirit Moon Flying Ship.Gu Yunyue's expression changed. She didn't think too much about Han Li's words. She stomped her foot.The flying ship shone brightly and rushed forward. In an instant, it flew nearly three hundred meters away and narrowly avoided the tornado.But before Gu Yunyue could breathe a sigh of relief, the ground around her suddenly cracked. Yellow light pillars soared into the sky.These yellow light pillars immediately intertwined. In the blink of an eye, they condensed into a large yellow array.A huge array appeared on the ground. It was three hundred meters in size. It was incomparably complicated.\"Array!\" Gu Yunyue's expression changed.She only felt her vision blur. The scenery around her changed. She appeared in a bright world. There were mountain peaks around her. The sky and the ground were flickering with a sparkling yellow light.An indescribably huge spiritual pressure came from all directions. It pressed towards the Spirit Moon Flying Ship.The white barrier on the flying ship immediately made cracking sounds. Countless cracks appeared. It looked like it was about to shatter.When Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan saw this, they suddenly became speechless.Upon seeing this, Han Li calmly extended a hand and summoned a small brass bell. It swelled to several tens of feet in size and abruptly landed on the flying boat, enveloping Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan within it.This small brass bell was a defensive magic treasure found in the long-faced Youth's storage bag. It just so happened to come in handy at this moment.Almost at the same time, the white barrier above the spirit boat shattered and a huge pressure came crashing down.Han Li and Gu Yunyue's bodies flashed with light and they withstood it.A buzzing sound rang out from the surface of the bell, and spiritual light flashed erratically from its surface, but it remained completely unscathed.\"Could it be that the people from the Tengui School came looking for us?\"Although Gu Yunyue could barely maintain her calm, the astonishing aura displayed by the array was not something an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator could do. She couldn't help but panic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as Han Li's voice fell, the surrounding space suddenly changed.In the air, a yellow sand mist appeared and a number of millstone-sized yellow boulders appeared out of thin air. There were at least twenty to thirty of them, and they were densely arranged, tightly surrounding the Spirit Moon Flying Ship.Gu Yunyue's heart thumped, but she didn't think too much. The surface of these boulders flashed, and they quickly rotated. With a whistling sound, they smashed toward the Spirit Moon Flying Ship.The woman was greatly shocked. She suddenly activated the sword art in her hand, and a black sword light soared into the sky. It swayed left and right, and instantly expanded, turning into a giant black sword that was over a hundred feet long.The giant sword rotated, and suddenly bloomed with a large black sword light. It faintly condensed into the shape of a dragon, dragging a long tail, and slashed at the nearest boulder.A loud sound!The boulder was barely broken by the giant sword, but the black giant sword also flew back as if it had suffered a heavy blow. The sword light on its surface completely collapsed.Gu Yunyue's body shook, and she took a few steps back before she could stand firm. Her eyes were filled with shock.The falling force of this boulder was almost comparable to the full strength attack of a Nascent Soul stage cultivator. Facing the twenty to thirty sparkling boulders that were rapidly approaching, she couldn't help but feel a chill in her heart!But at this time, Han Li's faint voice sounded in her ear:\"Protect Le 'er and the others, leave this to me.\"Gu Yunyue only saw a figure flash in front of her, and Han Li had already jumped up from the flying ship. His hands flickered with golden light, and his figure spun, and he punched at the void in all directions.\"Peng peng\" loud sounds came from all directions. All the yellow boulders were hit by a great force at almost the same time, and like eggs, they all burst into pieces, filling the sky with gravel.\"Hmph, as expected of a Strength Cultivator!\"A man's cold snort suddenly came from the air. The voice was ethereal, and it was impossible to tell where it came from.When Gu Yunyue heard the voice, she was pleasantly surprised. She hurriedly looked around, trying to find the owner of the voice.When Han Li heard this, a trace of ridicule appeared at the corner of his mouth. He suddenly turned around, and with a flick of his finger, an azure sword Qi shot out like lightning. It slashed at a corner of the yellow world, and exploded.Rumble!The space there fluctuated violently, and a black-robed man stumbled out of it.This person was quite sturdy, with a square face and a short beard. His face was filled with surprise.\"I didn't expect you to be a sword cultivator.For a Nascent Soul cultivator to be able to see through the illusion formation that I personally set up, he shouldn't be a nobody.What is your name and who is your master? \"The large man's expression quickly returned to normal as he slowly asked.\"It doesn't matter who I am. Dead people don't need to know too much.\" Han Li sneered.\"What a joke!Just now, I only displayed a portion of the formation's power, yet you're already so arrogant. Next time, I'll annihilate you in body and soul! \"The black-robed man was furious. He made a hand sign and yellow ripples appeared on his body. Then, he blurred and hid himself again.Seeing this, Han Li's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.The black-clothed man's Spirit Array was quite exquisite. At this moment, he should have dived deeper into the Spirit Array. Even with his current Spiritual Sense, he couldn't detect him.But then, he snorted and his body glowed with golden light. He planned to use brute force to break the formation so that the other party had nowhere to hide.But at this moment, a sudden change occurred!The entire sky suddenly darkened, and five massive beings with black gas lingering around them appeared, surrounding the Spirit Moon Flying Ship in the middle.Han Li's pupils shrank slightly and a dazzling blue light flickered in his eyes.Under the black gas, there were five black giant ghosts that were thirty to forty feet tall. If it weren't for the pair of curved horns on their heads, they would look like apes that had been enlarged countless times. Their bodies were covered with short black hair and their faces were green with fangs. Their eyes were blood red and they looked extremely ferocious. However, their expressions were very stiff.In the hands of each giant ghost, there was a black mini mountain.Compared to the five giant ghosts, Han Li and the others were as small as ants.Gu Yunyue's expression changed greatly!Each of the five giant ghosts exuded an aura above her and a layer of cold sweat instantly appeared on her forehead.As for Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan, under the terrifying spiritual pressure of the five giant ghosts, they were unable to withstand it and directly fell unconscious.Roar roar roar!The five giant ghosts let out deafening roars and a fierce light flashed in their blood red eyes. They waved their ape arms and suddenly threw out the five mini mountains in their hands.The mini mountains shone with black light and as soon as they left their hands, they expanded wildly. In the blink of an eye, they turned into more than a thousand feet tall mountains and smashed down towards Han Li and the others.Before the giant peak arrived, a terrifying pressure that caused one's heart to palpitate had already whistled over. The air around the Spirit Boat buzzed loudly and a gale suddenly rose.Gu Yunyue almost screamed in fear. Her last trace of rationality made her frantically summon several magic talismans in one breath, forming several layers of light barriers around herself and the two unconscious women.However, Han Li merely furrowed his brows as golden light flashed from both of his hands, following which he pushed his massive palms toward the oncoming mountain in a nonchalant manner.Boom boom boom. Five earth-shattering explosions sounded in succession!An incomparably powerful shockwave spread out, causing the entire yellow space to violently twist and tremble.The yellow space finally couldn't bear it anymore, and with a \"bang\", it shattered. The surrounding environment suddenly returned to the desert, and countless yellow lights spread out.The huge shockwave found a vent and spread out in all directions, causing the sandstorm within a radius of more than ten miles to churn violently and cover the sky.Although the yellow space shattered and disappeared, it was only an illusion. The yellow light on the ground was still there.The five giant ghosts were still standing in the air, but their expressions had returned to normal.Somewhere in the air, the black-robed man's figure flashed and a smug sneer appeared on his face.Even a Deity Transformation late cultivator without a good spirit treasure would find it difficult to resist the Five Ghosts Move the Mountain secret technique.But in the next moment, the smile on his face froze. He widened his eyes and looked down in disbelief.The five gargantuan mountains were stacked on top of each other like a human pyramid, and Han Li stood in mid-air at the foot of the five mountains in a calm and collected manner. He was holding the five mountains in one hand, and it was as if he were lifting them with ease.As for the Spirit Moon Flying Ship below Han Li, Gu Yunyue and the other two women were safe and sound.Without waiting for him to react, Han Li casually opened his mouth and blew. A white stream of air rolled out from his mouth.The five giant mountains were blown away by the white stream of air as if they were goose feathers.The surface of the mountains flickered with black light and quickly shrank to the size of the previous mini mountains.Han Li moved his hand and flicked his five fingers as if he was playing marbles.\"Chi Chi\" the sound of air being torn apart resounded.The five mini mountains attacked the black-robed man one after another. They were incredibly fast and appeared in front of him in a flash.The black-robed man's complexion changed. His body exuded a black light and he suddenly fell to the ground, narrowly avoiding the five mini mountains.Han Li's figure turned blurred and appeared in front of the five mini mountains like a ghost. He flicked his fingers again and the five mini mountains immediately stopped.His body spun around and kicked the two mini mountains with a whoosh.The two mountains immediately turned into two hazy phantoms and fell down like meteors. They were almost twice as fast as when they had just soared into the sky.The two mini mountains flickered with black light and their bodies expanded again. In the blink of an eye, they turned into two giant mountains that were a thousand feet in size. The sharp whistling sound also turned into a terrible loud sound.One of the mountains smashed towards the large array below, while the other flew towards the black-robed man.\"Boom\" a loud sound was heard!The former fiercely hit the yellow array pattern.The large array immediately glowed with dazzling light and tried to resist. However, it was easily crushed and torn apart by the astonishing power contained in the giant mountain. \"Bang\", it turned into countless streamers and exploded.The large array was shattered and the Spirit Moon Flying Ship suddenly regained its freedom. It was swept away by a gust of wind and was blown far away like a small boat.The other giant mountain smashed towards the black-robed man at lightning speed. The black-robed man hadn't even landed on the ground when the giant mountain caught up with him.The black-robed man was horrified. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood essence. His body was suddenly shrouded in blood-red light. His body twisted and turned into a strange snake-shaped light that flew away. Its speed was several times faster than before.\"Boom!\"The black giant mountain smashed into the ground and splashed countless smoke and dust.The moment the giant mountain landed, the snake-shaped light flew away. It flashed and appeared a thousand feet away. The black-robed man's face was covered with cold sweat.Before he could breathe a sigh of relief, a whistling sound exploded in his ears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe burly man shouted and waved his hands.Then, two rays of light \u2014 one black and one yellow \u2014 shot out. They were a black crutch wrapped in black light and a large yellow seal with countless runes on its surface. Both of them were aimed at the black peak.The two magic weapons exuded an astonishing wave of spiritual power. It was obvious that they were their trump cards.The burly man made a hand seal and shouted without any hesitation.Two loud bangs were heard!Two huge balls of light, one black and one yellow, appeared. As the flames tumbled, they stopped the falling black mountain, causing it to pause for a moment.The burly man took advantage of this opportunity to shoot backwards.However, the two halos only lasted for a moment. The burly man was only able to fly a few dozen feet away. Then, the black light lingering on the top of the giant peak crushed the two halos and smashed into the ground. Smoke and dust splashed everywhere.The burly man's figure flew out of the smoke and dust. But, his figure wasn't as fast as before. His complexion was as pale as a sheet of paper. Half of his body was bathed in blood, and his left arm hung limply at his side.He had dodged quickly. But, the speed of the giant peak was too fast. So, his body had been grazed by it in a panic. And, he had sustained serious injuries.Puff!The burly man spouted a mouthful of blood. Then, his body fell to the ground. His face was full of fear. But, he immediately gritted his teeth and waved his hand. He took out a white magic charm. It was inscribed with countless runes. It was incomparably complex and exuded strong spatial fluctuations.The burly man mumbled something. He gathered the remaining magic power in his body and was about to activate this magic charm.But, the sky above his head darkened again. Then, a whistling sound rang in his ears. Another giant peak came crashing down. It was even faster than the previous three giant peaks.The burly man's complexion changed dramatically. He needed some time to activate this spatial magic charm.He made a strange hand seal with his right hand. Then, the black light on his body soared and condensed into a black magic array.The magic array fluctuated. Then, the five giant ghosts \u2014 which had been standing in the void a moment ago \u2014 appeared around him out of thin air. They protected him in the middle.At this moment, the eyes of the five ghosts surged with blood-red light, and they roared in unison. Black light burst out from their ten claws, shooting out long black claw lights towards the black mountain peak that was whistling down from the sky.Bang, bang, bang!As soon as the black lights touched the giant mountain, they immediately collapsed inch by inch. The giant mountain's momentum slowed down a bit, but it still quickly broke all the claws and smashed down.The five ghosts let out a shrill howl in unison, and the black Qi on the surface of their bodies surged. Their bodies suddenly bulged, revealing rock-like muscles, especially on their hands and feet.Ten thick arms stretched out at the same time, fearlessly lifting the black peak.However, as soon as the ten arms touched the giant mountain, they were immediately shattered by a tremendous force. The five giant ghosts continued to roar and use their bodies to push against the black mountain, not retreating in the slightest.The gigantic black peak smashed into the five ghosts, producing a series of grinding sounds as flesh and blood splattered everywhere.The giant mountain finally stopped.The upper bodies of the five ghosts were also shattered, but their broken bodies were still standing straight. Their feet sunk deep into the desert, like five thick pillars supporting a giant mountain.The black-robed man heaved a sigh of relief. Then, the remaining magic power in his body gushed out, and poured into the white magic charm.The talisman slowly glowed with white light. He was ecstatic.However, right at this moment, a loud noise was heard.The last giant mountain fell from the sky and smashed on the fourth giant mountain.A terrifying force suddenly pressed down, and the broken bodies of the five ghosts burst into pieces with a bang.The black-robed man only felt that the nearby air was tight, and he couldn't move at all.Two giant mountains crashed down and pressed on his body.The big man didn't even have time to scream, and his body was crushed into meat paste.\"Whoosh!\"In the vast sand and dust at the bottom of the giant mountain, a golden light suddenly shot out. After a sudden flash, it shot into the distance.Han Li's eyes focused, and he saw a small golden person about three inches tall. Its facial features were exactly the same as the black-robed man, but the hair on its head was disheveled. It had a horrified expression on its face, and its arms were tightly wrapped around a silver storage bracelet. It was flying toward the northwest direction.It was the black-robed man's Nascent Soul!\"Go!\"He grabbed in the air with one hand and flicked his wrist casually. A black light flashed out of his hand and shot toward the direction of the black-robed man's Nascent Soul.Not far away, Gu Yunyue just cast a spell to stabilize the Spirit Moon Spirit Boat, and she happened to look over here. She only heard a sharp sound like an arrow in her ears, but her eyes couldn't catch the flight trajectory of the black light.The next moment, there was an explosion in the distant sky. The black-robed man's Nascent Soul had burst into a golden light.A palm-sized black thing also fell from mid-air. It turned out to be a piece of ordinary iron essence.As for the silver storage bracelet in the burly man's hand, Han Li waved a hand through the air, and it landed firmly in his grasp. His body then flashed a few times, and the five scattered mountains shrank back into his storage bracelet before he leaped back onto the Spirit Moon Spirit Vessel.Gu Yunyue looked at Han Li blankly as if she was looking at a stranger.She didn't think much about the origin of the black-robed man in the panic before, but after recalling the other party's words and secret techniques, she recognized his identity.This person was an elder of the Soul Formation Early Stage called \"Lu Ya\" from the Tengui School. He was good at exorcism. It was said that more than ten years ago, he fought with two cultivators of the same rank in the Jing Taoist Temple and didn't fall into a disadvantageous position. From then on, he became famous.Yet, such a renowned Deity Transformation cultivator had been slain by Han Li in the blink of an eye. This was truly beyond the scope of his imagination.This woman finally figured out that the difference in strength between her and Han Li was like heaven and earth, and the degree of shock in her heart could be imagined.\"Han \u2026 Friend Han, are you really just a Nascent Soul cultivator?\"Gu Yunyue finally recovered and asked with a wry smile, but the trace of awe on her face could be seen by anyone.\"Could it be that you can't tell whether or not I'm a Nascent Soul cultivator?\" Han Li asked in a noncommittal manner.Gu Yunyue sighed and said, \"I can naturally tell the level of your aura.However, Fellow Daoist Han is far too powerful.Even among the Soul Formation Elders of our sect, there aren't many who can easily kill someone of the same cultivation base. \"\"Han only cultivated his body to be slightly more powerful. How could he be compared to the powerful cultivators of the Leng Yan Sect?\"Han Li shook his head and didn't say anything else. Instead, he looked at the unconscious Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan on the ground and shook his sleeve. An azure light swept over the two women.The two women finally opened their eyes and woke up, but there was a hint of confusion in their eyes.Liu Le 'er was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, so she immediately thought of something and sat up straight in shock.\"Brother Stone!Just now \u2026 \"\"Don't worry, everything is fine now. We can continue on our way.\" Han Li gently said as if nothing had happened.\u2026 \u2026\"Peak Lord, according to Martial Nephew Gu's information, this Vagrant Cultivator Han isn't just an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator.I didn't think Martial Nephew Gu would have such an unexpected harvest on this trip. \"In the Cold Flame Sect, in the conference hall of a certain mountain peak, a rough-looking burly man stood in front of a middle-aged man in a scholar's robe and said so.The middle-aged man had a fair complexion and wore a scholar's headband. He wore an azure scholarly robe and held an azure scroll in his hand. He looked like a refined scholar.\"To be able to kill an early Soul Formation cultivator with just the power of his body, it seems he is a high grade cultivator.\" The Confucian robed man nodded.\"Hehe, no matter what, it's great that the Heavenly Ghost Sect has one less Deity Transformation Stage elder.I'm very interested in this vagrant cultivator with the Han surname, \"the burly man chuckled with a hint of elation on his face.The scholarly robed man smiled and said: \"If that's the case, then you'll personally receive them when the time comes.You should be very clear about what to do. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt the same time, in the hall of a certain cave abode.A skinny old man in ochre robes sat on the main seat with a teacup in his hand. A middle-aged man with a pair of small eyes stood respectfully in front of him.The skinny old man didn't even raise his head as he slowly said, \"Lu Ya should be done with his matter by now.\"\"With Elder Lu's help, there's nothing to lose.Only the ancestor can invite Elder Lu. \"The middle-aged man respectfully said.\"Ai, the younger generation in the clan are all useless. Only Hao 'er is to my liking. It's a pity \u2026 Hmph, that Han brat really won't be able to appease my hatred even if he dies ten thousand times.\" The skinny old man angrily slammed the teacup on the table.\"Ancestor, please calm down. No matter what, that Yu Menghan is a pleasant surprise. There's hope for you to achieve great success.\" The middle-aged man hurriedly said when he saw the old man's expression.\"En.Come to think of it, she has something to do with Hao 'er's death. For the sake of her spirit body, I'll let her live for now. \"The skinny old man's expression softened.As soon as he finished speaking, his expression changed and he turned to look at the entrance of the cave abode.A moment later, the sound of footsteps could be heard. A young servant appeared at the entrance and bowed.\"Elder Qi, Elder Mo is here to see you!\"Before the skinny old man could speak, a man's voice sounded from outside the cave abode.\"Elder Qi Xuan must be in a good mood to be able to enjoy tea at a time like this.\"Then, a middle-aged man wearing a black robe and a tall hat appeared outside the door with an indifferent expression.The skinny old man raised his eyebrows and signaled the servant to leave with his eyes. He didn't get up and asked, \"Mo Chen, your Law Enforcement Hall and I have never interfered with each other. What are you doing here?\"\"Not long ago, Elder Lu Ya's soul tablet suddenly shattered.Does Elder Qi have anything to say? \"Mo Chen didn't answer the old man's question. Instead, he bluntly asked a question.\"What did you say?\" Qi Xuan immediately jumped up from his seat and shouted with a livid expression.\"According to the people who traveled with Elder Lu, he died for no reason because you asked him to kill a group of people.May I ask Elder Qi who exactly is the person you asked him to kill? \"Mo Chen asked coldly.\"This is impossible!How could two mere Nascent Soul cultivators be a match for Lu Ya?! \"Qi Xuan's face was full of disbelief.\"Hehe, killing a Deity Transformation Initial Stage cultivator and preventing his Nascent Soul from escaping, does Elder Qi not know what kind of power is required to accomplish such a feat?I only hope that Elder Qi won't attract a troublesome enemy for our sect because of his personal grudges.In any case, please follow me to the Law Enforcement Hall first, Elder Qi. \"Mo Chen sneered and his voice suddenly became cold.\u2026Several days later, the flying ark that Han Li and the others were on finally departed from the Ancient Yellow Desert.Along the way, apart from encountering several waves of sinister flying ants that were easily dealt with by Han Li through Magic Light, there were no other pursuers from the Tengui School.With the precedent of killing a Deity Transformation cultivator, Gu Yunyue wasn't surprised that Han Li was able to repel the sinister flying ants.Yu Menghan and Liu Le 'er were a little tired from the continuous running and turbulence. The two of them leaned on each other and fell into a deep sleep on the side of the spirit boat.Han Li sat cross-legged at the back of the spirit boat with his brows slightly furrowed and a strange expression on his face.In front of him, seven or eight green jade bottles and white porcelain bottles were placed in a disorderly manner, and they were all empty.\"Friend Han, how is it?\" Magic Light's voice sounded in Han Li's mind.Han Li sighed and said, \"Although a majority of these pills came from that Deity Transformation cultivator, there are a few high-grade pills among them, but none of them are useful.\"In the previous battle, although he relied on his powerful physical strength and borrowed the power of the five mountains to crush his opponent, it didn't consume much of his magic power. However, the magic power in his body decreased instead of increasing. This wasn't a long-term plan.\"What about the top grade spirit stone?\"\"It's the same, it can't be absorbed at all.\" Han Li smiled bitterly and released his palm, revealing a spirit stone that had already become dull.\"It seems that only some special pills will be effective.\" Magic Light said blankly.\"Perhaps.Previously, only the Horoscope Pill and Qi Minghao's unknown golden pill had been effective.In any case, when I get to the Icy Flame Sect, I'll ask for a Horoscope Gaze Pill and examine it. Perhaps I'll know the answer then, \"Han Li said as he stroked the small vial in his robes.\u2026 \u2026Half a month later, in the sky above a verdant mountain range, a strange crescent moon shaped spirit boat slowly appeared.On the spirit boat stood one man and three women, it was Han Li, Gu Yunyue and the other two.\"Friend Han, Menghan, Le'Er, this Spirit Flame mountain range is the mountain gate of our Leng Yan Sect.\" Gu Yunyue said with a smile as her eyes swept across the mountain forest below.\"The spirit vein is stable, the spirit qi is dense, it is indeed a rare paradise.\" Han Li's eyes flashed as he nodded.Yu Menghan's heart was filled with joy at first, but after looking around a few times, she looked at Gu Yunyue with a puzzled expression.The little fox girl held the edge of the spirit boat with both hands and stretched out her body to look around, but she could only see the lush forest and ancient trees, there was no trace of a sect building. She couldn't help but ask:\"Brother, I also feel that the spirit qi in this place is very rich, but I don't see any sect.\"\"But all the big sects have a Sect Protecting Formation, we are now outside the formation, like standing outside a high wall, naturally we can't see the scenery inside the wall.\" Han Li said with a smile.When Liu Le 'er and Yu Menghan heard this, they nodded their heads, not really understanding.\"Friend Han, please wait a moment, let me pass the message.\" Gu Yunyue said to Han Li.After saying that, she turned her wrist and a golden token engraved with a flame pattern appeared in the palm of her hand.As the token emitted a ray of light, the flame pattern suddenly shook, as if it was really burning.A ray of light shot out from the token and rushed straight into the mountain range below.After a while, a ripple suddenly appeared in the void below the spirit boat, and a faint arc-shaped golden light curtain appeared.Looking up, one could see that the Spirit Flame mountain range that stretched for hundreds of miles was almost completely shrouded under this layer of light curtain.\"As expected of one of the big sects, the aura is indeed extraordinary.\" Han Li swept his gaze and said with a seemingly admiring tone.At this moment, Liu Le'Er and Yu Menghan were grabbing the edge of the spirit boat at this moment, their faces were full of disbelief, their four beautiful eyes turned back and forth, constantly scanning the area below.They saw that under the layer of pale golden light curtain, there were palaces and buildings everywhere, as well as pavilions and terraces everywhere.Among them, some were hanging alone on the high cliffs, some were connected together, forming a group of gardens, some were built in the ravines, and some were located halfway up the mountain, forming a unique courtyard.And in the middle of the entire mountain range, there were more than ten mountains that were far higher than the surrounding mountains, surrounded by white mist, purple clouds, and rainbow light jumping between the mountains, looking quite like an immortal paradise.\"It's so beautiful \u2026\" Yu Menghan couldn't help but praise.Liu Le'Er also nodded repeatedly, deeply agreeing.\"Friend Han, Elder Luo is already waiting for us at Chuyun Peak, let's go there now.\" Returning to the sect, Gu Yunyue was obviously in a good mood, and said with an obvious smile on her face.Han Li nodded.Just when the spirit boat passed through the layer of light curtain, he felt a Divine Sense exploration, it should be this Elder Luo.After they officially entered the Leng Yan Sect, Liu Le'Er looked up curiously and found that the light curtain just now had disappeared. What she could see was only the blue sky and white clouds.The spirit boat flew toward the middle of the mountain range, and finally landed on one of the towering green mountain peaks.At the foot of the mountain peak, there was a wide white stone square. A big man stood on it, looking in the direction of the spirit boat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Greetings Martial Uncle Luo.\" After Gu Yunyue put away the flying boat, she took a few steps forward and bowed respectfully to the rough man.\"Martial Nephew Gu, you've worked hard.This must be Friend Han, right? \"The big man nodded and his eyes fell on Han Li.\"I'm Han Li.\" Han Li replied calmly.\"Today, Peak Master Nangong wanted to greet you personally, but there are some urgent matters in the sect, so I, Luo Jun, can only greet you on his behalf. I hope Friend Han doesn't mind.\" The rough man said with a smile.\"You're too polite.\" Han Li said with a smile.\"This must be Martial Nephew Gu's new disciple, right? Not bad, not bad!Martial Nephew really has a good eye. \"Luo Jun's eyes fell on Yu Menghan, and his eyes lit up slightly.\"Junior Yu Menghan greets Elder Luo.\" Yu Menghan hurriedly stepped forward and bowed.\"As long as this child cultivates hard, his achievements in the future will definitely not be lower than mine.\" Gu Yunyue also said with a smile.Then, Luo Jun greeted Liu Le 'er. When he learned that she and Han Li called each other brother and sister, a strange look flashed on his face, but it was only a flash, and he didn't say much.Ever since Liu Le 'er saw the powerful strength displayed by Han Li along the way, she was not as nervous and uneasy as before when facing foreign human cultivators. She believed that as long as her \"Brother Stone\" was here, no one could bully her.\"Fellow Daoist Han was able to kill a Deity Transformation cultivator and escort Martial Nephew Gu and his disciple safely back to the sect. With such strength and merits, you are more than qualified to become an outer sect elder of our Cloud Emergence Peak.Now there are more than ten cave mansions for elders to choose from. I wonder if Friend Han has any special requirements so that I can arrange it for you. \"Elder Luo's eyes returned to Han Li. He first praised him, then asked.\"To tell you the truth, Han has yet to recover from his injuries. It would be best if he could find a secluded place to recuperate and recover.In addition, Han has a rough understanding of alchemy techniques. If there is a Spirit Field near the Immortal's Cave to grow some Spirit Herbs, that would be even better. \"Han Li didn't hold back and said unhurriedly.\"Oh, how unfortunate. Among the remaining cave abodes, there are a few secluded places that meet your requirements, but unfortunately, none of them have spirit fields.Most of the spirit fields on Chu Yun Peak are managed by the disciples and are basically distributed on the slopes below the mountainside that face the sun. The locations are not considered quiet. \"Hearing this, Luo Jun was slightly startled at first, then he frowned slightly and said with some hesitation:Han Li frowned slightly when he heard this, and he seemed to have fallen into a dilemma.When Luo Jun saw the change in Han Li's expression, he muttered to himself for a moment before suggesting, \"How about this? Fellow Daoist Han, choose an area near the spirit fields and I'll immediately have someone build you a new cave residence. How about it?\"\"Haha!Why so troublesome? Since there is no spirit field in the cave abode, Han can just move one up. I just don't know if Elder Luo's move is in line with the rules? \"Han Li blinked and suddenly said with a laugh.Gu Yun Yue and Yu Menghan were stunned when they heard this. They were a little confused.Liu Le 'er snuggled up to Han Li's side and didn't care about what they said at all. She just looked around curiously at the surrounding scenery.\"Haha, I don't want to go to the mountain, but let the mountain come to me. Friend Han is really bold!What's wrong with this?Please come with me. \"Luo Jun obviously didn't expect Han Li to answer like this. He laughed and showed a look of interest on his face.Therefore, in the following time, under Luo Jun's lead, the few of them came to a sunny valley on the mountainside of Chuyun Peak. In the valley, there were several reclaimed and divided spiritual fields, which were about an acre in size. There were some servants busy on the fields.\"Friend Han, these spiritual fields used to belong to an outer elder, but a few years ago, he died in an accident after going out. The spiritual fields have been entrusted to me and haven't been distributed yet. If you like it, you can take it as you wish.\" Luo Jun waved his hand casually and said to Han Li meaningfully.\"Thank you, Elder Luo. Then Han won't be polite.\" Han Li looked around the valley, and a faint smile appeared on his face.Seeing this, Luo Jun didn't know why, but he had a strange feeling of insecurity.Han Li walked forward and took a deep breath. He then bent down, raised his fist, and abruptly smashed it into the ground.\"Boom!\" A loud sound rang out!The whole valley suddenly trembled. The place where the fist landed immediately sank into a big hole. It wasn't big, but it seemed bottomless. Yu Menghan's feet were unstable.Yu Menghan stumbled, and if it wasn't for Gu Yunyue supporting her, she would have fallen to the ground.Liu Le 'er's body swayed a few times, and she also staggered for a while. She quickly stabilized her body.The servants who were still working in the spiritual fields were mostly small cultivators in the qi cultivation stage. They didn't know what was going on, so they all screamed and hurriedly ran out of the valley.Luo Jun had already calmed down at this moment. His eyes flashed as he looked at Han Li, and he didn't say a word.Han Li walked along the edge of the spiritual field into the valley. After walking a few hundred feet, he bent down and slammed his fist on the ground again.In the time it took for a stick of incense to burn, the rumbling sound resounded in the valley. Han Li's footprints also went around the entire valley, and finally returned in front of Luo Jun and the others.At this moment, Luo Jun looked at Han Li's calm and unruffled look, and he only felt his mouth go dry. He couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.Han Li didn't say much. He squatted down and rubbed his palms.He suddenly raised both of his hands, which were like knives, and suddenly inserted them into the ground.\"Up!\"Han Li let out an explosive shout and abruptly raised his hands.\"Rumble \u2026\"The rumbling sound in the valley continued, and a crack suddenly appeared on the ground. It gradually expanded from Han Li's palms, and extended to the left and right sides.Every place that Han Li's fist bombarded was connected by this crack, and finally, it surrounded the entire spiritual field in the valley.Liu Le 'er finally understood what her brother was doing. Her small face blushed, and her face was full of worship.\"This \u2026\" Gu Yunyue opened her mouth, but she couldn't say anything for a long time.Only to hear a \"boom\" sound, Han Li suddenly raised both of his hands, and suddenly uprooted the entire spiritual field, and lifted it vertically.Looking from afar, it looked like this spiritual field was floating in the air.Yu Menghan looked at the scene in front of her, and she was completely stunned.\"Let's go, Elder Luo, let's take a look at my new cave mansion.\" Han Li looked relaxed, and turned to Luo Jun with a smile.Luo Jun looked at the entire spiritual field that had been dug up, and the valley that had become desolate, and he couldn't help but have a feeling of not knowing whether to laugh or cry.He originally thought that Han Li would at most choose a piece of this spiritual field, and use some kind of secret technique to move the mountain. He didn't expect that he would actually dig up the entire spiritual field with just his physical strength.However, he was the one who let him take it as he pleased just now, and naturally couldn't say anything now. He could only smile bitterly and lead the way up the mountainside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jun heaved a sigh of relief as he watched Han Li carve out a massive crater that was around an acre in size somewhere in this secluded cave abode. He then placed the piece of spirit field into the crater, and he let loose a hearty laugh.\"Haha, Fellow Daoist Han's divine strength is world-shocking and far exceeds my expectations. Seeing is believing a hundred times. I'm impressed!\"\"Mr. Luo is too kind.Since the test is over, can you talk to me about business? \"Hearing the praise of the other party, Han Li asked with a faint smile.\"Cough!Friend Han must be joking, how could I have such a thought.By the way, as a guest elder of the sect, you don't actually need to do anything. Every year, the sect will give 50,000 spirit stones and some elixirs for cultivation.However, this year's elixir distribution has passed, so you can only wait until next year to receive it.This is your token. There is a map of the sect and some simple introductions about each peak. Also, this is the year's offering, a total of 80,000 spirit stones. The extra 30,000 is a little gift from peak master Nangong. \"Luo Jun awkwardly smiled and changed the topic. At the same time, he took out a sparkling golden command medallion and an azure storage pouch and handed them over to Han Li.When Gu Yunyue heard the words, she looked at Han Li with a complicated expression. What Elder Luo said just now was the treatment that only the elders of the Soul Formation Stage in the sect could receive.Judging from Han Li's performance along the way, he did have this qualification.\"Thank you very much.May I know if the sect distributes the Wangxi Pill every year, or is there another way to get it? \"Han Li thanked him, took the token and spirit stones, and asked casually.\"Oh, the Wangxi Pill Sect occasionally distributes it. Although it has an excellent healing effect, it has no effect on cultivation after all. Some people will still take it out to trade in the sect market, but most of them will be exchanged quickly. It is not easy to get.\" Luo Jun replied very familiarly.\"It seems I'll have to try my luck,\" Han Li said with a pensive look on his face.Luo Jun didn't stay here for long. After chatting for a while, he left with Gu Yunyue and Yu Menghan.In the following time, Han Li activated all the enchantments in the cave house area, then he took Liu Le 'er around the cave house, arranged a bedroom for her, and let her have a good rest before leaving the cave house.After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, Han Li appeared in a valley several kilometers away from Cloud Emergence Peak.At the entrance of the valley stood a white stone archway, engraved with three large vermilion words \"Easy Valley\". Below the archway, a wide bluestone street followed the path of the valley, extending into the valley.This Tongyi Valley was the Sect's market that Luo Jun had previously mentioned. Before entering the valley, he could already hear the clamor of a secular market.After Han Li stopped for a while at the entrance of the valley, he walked forward. When he came under the arch, most of the scene in the valley was reflected in his eyes.The streets here were generally sloping upwards, and both sides of the streets were lined with shops and houses. All the shops were built according to the terrain of the mountains, and there were all kinds of banners hung outside, making it look like a bustling city in the secular world.At this moment, it was afternoon, and the place was bustling with people going in and out of various shops. It was very lively.Han Li randomly picked a rather stylish elixir shop and walked in. After a while, he walked out expressionlessly and continued to walk to the next shop.He went to five or six large elixir shops in a row, but he didn't even see the shadow of a Wangxi Pill. He only learned from one of the shops that the last pill was received two months ago, and it was exchanged on the day it was put on the shelf.As a result, after spending half a day, Han Li almost walked through more than half of the Tongyi Valley, but he still found nothing.After leaving a small shop, Han Li didn't continue to hurry towards the back of the valley. Instead, he leisurely walked towards a secluded corner. Halfway there, he suddenly turned around and coldly said to a large tree not far away, \"That's right.\"Sir has been following me for half a day since I entered the valley. Do you have any advice?\"\"Sir, please don't be angry. It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.\"A dry laugh sounded from behind the tree. An old man in a grey robe walked around the tree trunk and walked in front of Han Li.This person's eyebrows were white, and his face was like a child's. His face was full of spirit, and he looked a bit out of this world.\"Misunderstanding?\" Han Li felt the other party's Soul Formation Stage cultivation and said expressionlessly.The white bearded old man's expression didn't change, and he said calmly, \"I'm Gao Buji, the elder of Dusk Peak. I just happened to find that sir has been searching for the Wangxi Pill, so I followed you for a few steps.\"\"Dusk Peak?If I remember correctly, it's the branch in the sect that specializes in refining pills, right?Sir, could it be that you have the Wangxi Pill in your hands? \"Han Li raised his brows and asked.\"Hehe, I do have a Wangxi Pill in my hands, and I also have the intention to trade with someone. It's just that I don't know if there's anything that I need?\" Gao Buji glanced at the storage pouch on Han Li's waist and said with a smile.\"I wonder what Elder Gao wants to trade?\" Han Li asked without batting an eyelid.\"No rush. I still don't know how to address sir?\" Gao Buji wasn't in a hurry to state a price and asked instead.\"I'm Han Li, an outer sect guest of Cloud Protruding Peak.Now, can Elder Gao tell me what you want to trade? \"Han Li asked with a calm expression.\"Cloud Protruding Peak's outer sect guest?Sir's divine ability is impressive. I actually can't see through sir's cultivation!But this is all a small matter.Frigid Yin Profound Water, Blue Crystal Resonating Sand, Milky River Star Stone, or a Lan Ling Flower or Ink Fragrance Grass over three thousand years old \u2026 I wonder if Friend Han has one or two of these materials?As long as you have any of them, you can trade for the Wangxi Pill in my hands, \"Gao Buji said as he twirled his beard.\"Elder Gao, are you joking? Which one of these materials isn't an extremely rare spirit material of heaven and earth?If sir has these things, are you willing to use them to trade for the Wangxi Pill? \"Han Li's expression darkened, and he asked in reply.The white-bearded old man stiffened when he heard this. He immediately revealed an embarrassed expression and didn't say anything.\"Sir, it's better if you say something practical. Otherwise, Han can also buy it with spirit stones,\" Han Li continued.Although he didn't gain much just now, he still sold some of the materials and pills he had previously obtained in exchange for a lot of spirit stones. In addition to the spirit stones that Luo Jun had given him before, he had quite a bit of wealth. Of course, the few supreme spirit stones that he had previously obtained were not included in this list.\"Well, since Friend Han has said so, then I'll trade with spirit stones. Just treat it as making a friend with Friend Han.One Wangxi Pill for two supreme spirit stones, how about it? \"Gao Buji pondered for a moment and sighed.\"Elder Gao, aren't you asking for too much?Even if the Wangxi Pill is rarely sold in this market, the highest price won't exceed six hundred thousand spirit stones. \"Han Li frowned, and he looked a little displeased.\"I don't think it's too much. After all, this is the price in this sect's market. If it was taken to an auction outside, it would be difficult to get a price.\" Gao Buji said unhurriedly.\"How about this, although Han doesn't have the spirit materials you want, he has some other good things on hand. Are you interested?\" Han Li pondered for a moment and said.\"Other things?Friend Han, if it's some common magic treasures, then there's no need to take them out. It's more convenient to settle with spirit stones. \"Gao Buji smiled and said.\"Azure Crystal, Myriad Yin Spirit Trap Formation, Soul Yin Ganoderma. Are these things common?\" Han Li asked.These items were all obtained from the storage pouch of the Deity Transformation cultivator surnamed Lu from the Tengui School. Their quality wasn't low, but they weren't of much use to him.The old man revealed a hesitant expression. After a long while, he reluctantly said, \"The first two items are fine. The Soul Yin Ganoderma is somewhat useful.However, it has to be at least a thousand years old. In addition to the three hundred thousand spirit stones, the Wangxi Pill is yours. \"When Han Li heard this, he turned around and left without the slightest hesitation.\"Friend Han, please wait!\"When Gao Buji saw Han Li suddenly turn to leave, he immediately lost his previous calm appearance and hurriedly called out.Of course, Han Li didn't really want to leave. He took a few steps forward and stopped at Gao Buji's call. However, he wasn't in a hurry to leave. Instead, he turned around and looked at the old man.Gao Buji quickly walked forward and smiled awkwardly, \"Friend Han, don't be in such a hurry to leave. The price can still be discussed. However, I don't know if you can let me take a look at the Soul Yin Ganoderma?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Tsk tsk, Friend Han's luck is not small. This Soul Yin Ganoderma is at least two thousand three hundred \u2026 no, two thousand four hundred years old. That's more than enough to exchange for the Wangxi Pill \u2026\" Gao Buqian's eyes rolled a few times as he spoke.\"This Soul Yin Ganoderma can be exchanged for two Wangxi Pills.\" Han Li interrupted Gao Buqian's words.\"This \u2026 Friend Han, I only have one of these pills.\" Gao Buqian replied with a wry smile.\"The elders of the other peaks may not have it, but I don't believe an elder of the Dawnfall Peak who specializes in alchemy can't take out two Wangxi Pills.If Elder Gao wishes to make things difficult for me, then I can wait a few more days. I'm sure a sect as large as yours will have someone willing to sell them, \"Han Li said in an unhurried manner.Gao Buqian's white brows furrowed. This time, he really fell into hesitation. After struggling for a long time, he clapped his hands fiercely and said,\"Deal!\"Han Li accepted a white jade box from the white-browed elder. He scanned it with his Divine Sense and a smile appeared on his face.The person's body faintly exuded a mixed herbal scent, which was equivalent to telling him the person's identity as an alchemist.A two or three thousand year old spirit medicine might be rare and precious to others, but to him, it was naturally nothing. It was far less useful than the two Wangxi Pills in his hand.Gao Buqian brought the wooden box to his nose and sniffed it for a while. Only then did he let out a long sigh of satisfaction and happily put it away into his storage bag. He then said to Han Li, \"Come to the Dawnfall Peak when you have time.\" He then hurriedly bid farewell and left.After that, Han Li did not immediately leave the market. Instead, he wandered around the valley and exchanged most of the spirit stones in his hand for a few high-grade pills similar to the Wangxi Pill. Only then did he leave the valley and fly towards the Chuyun Peak.After returning to the cave dwelling, Han Li saw Liu Le 'er sitting alone in the hall with one hand supporting her chin in a daze.\"Le 'er, what are you thinking about?\" Han Li asked as he sat opposite Liu Le' er.\"Big Brother \u2026\" The little fox girl called out happily when she saw that Han Li had returned.\"Why are you daydreaming here alone?\" Han Li smiled gently.\"Le 'er is thinking about what happened after I met my big brother. I feel like I'm dreaming,\" Liu Le' er said seriously.Han Li was startled at first, but then he laughed.\"If this is a dream, Le'Er really hopes that she will never wake up.In this world, besides my parents, big brother is the only one who treats me the best. Le'Er hopes that big brother will always be by my side. \"The little fox girl's nose suddenly turned sour as she spoke in a low voice.Han Li looked at Liu Le'er and hesitated for a moment. Then, he suddenly raised his hand and placed two fingers on her forehead.Liu Le'er didn't understand and jumped in fright, but she didn't move away.\"Close your eyes,\" Han Li said softly.When Liu Le'er heard this, she didn't hesitate and immediately closed her eyes tightly.Han Li shook his head with a smile and closed his eyes as well, silently chanting.After the time it took to burn a stick of incense, Han Li opened his eyes.Liu Le 'er, who was sitting opposite him, was already slightly pale at this moment, and there was sweat on her temples.Han Li withdrew his fingers and said, \"Alright, you can open your eyes now.\"Liu Le'er's long eyelashes trembled as she slowly opened her eyes. She looked at Han Li with a puzzled expression.\"Just now, I have already imprinted the 'Fantasy Spirit Transformation' cultivation method into your sea of knowledge. This is a high-level Demon Clan cultivation method that I came across by accident. It is suitable for your fox body to cultivate.\" Han Li smiled slightly.When Liu Le'er heard this, she closed her eyes and felt it. Her small face was still a little confused.\"Although I will do my best to protect you, if I am not by your side, you must be able to protect yourself. At least, you must be able to hold on until I find you,\" Han Li explained slowly and seriously.Liu Le'er listened and thought for a moment. Then, she nodded and said to Han Li seriously, \"Yes, Le'er will definitely cultivate this cultivation method.\"Han Li nodded with a smile.\u2026 \u2026Cloud Protruding Peak, in a meeting hall.\"Peak Master, that person is indeed a high-level Strength Cultivator. We have already made the necessary arrangements and didn't alert anyone from the other peaks.As for Martial Nephew Gu, we have already rewarded him according to your instructions. We have also warned that we must not tell anyone about that person killing a Soul Formation cultivator. \"Luo Jun said respectfully to the middle-aged man in a scholar's robe.\"Alright.This person's body is strong. He can kill a Soul Formation cultivator at the Nascent Soul Stage. He will naturally be of great use to our peak in the future.Take care of him. If he has any requests, try your best to fulfill them. \"Peak Master Nangong nodded.\"Yes,\" Luo Jun replied.\"You may leave.\" Peak Master Nangong waved his hand.Luo Jun bowed and retreated.\"Han Li \u2026\" Peak Master Nangong murmured to himself. He closed his eyes and meditated for a moment. Then, he stood up and walked towards the back.\u2026 \u2026Han Li naturally didn't know about the conversation between Peak Master Nangong and Luo Jun.At this moment, he was sitting cross-legged in a secret chamber in the cave abode. More than ten jade bottles and jade boxes were lined up on the table in front of him.He held a small red bottle in his hand. He opened the cork and poured out a fiery-red pill. A strong medicinal fragrance spread out. After examining it for a while, he raised his head and swallowed it. Then, he closed his eyes and checked the condition of his body.After a while, he opened his eyes and frowned slightly.Although the rank of this fiery-red pill was similar to the Horoscope Pill, it didn't have any effect on him.Han Li didn't show any surprise. He casually picked up the second bottle of pills and poured out a glistening yellow pill.The pill melted in his stomach, but it still didn't produce any magic power.After a while, Han Li opened his eyes and expressionlessly picked up the third bottle \u2026Soon, he had tried more than half of the pills on the table. Unfortunately, they were all useless. There was only a purple jade box and a blue and white porcelain bottle left on the table.Han Li's expression was solemn, and he couldn't help but feel a little depressed.It seemed that finding another pill that was suitable for him was much more difficult than he had imagined. However, he had finally arrived at the Leng Yan Sect. With his current understanding of the Spirit Huan World, there were all kinds of cultivation resources here. As long as he put in some effort, he should be able to gain something.As he thought about this, he picked up the purple jade box from the table and used his fingers to pick out a gray pill from the box. He raised his head and swallowed it.This time, Han Li's heart jolted, and a hint of joy finally appeared on his face.He felt traces of magic power emerge from the pill and circulate one round in his meridians before merging into his dantian. It caused his magic power to increase slightly.Although the effect of this gray pill was far from the Horoscope Pill, no matter what, he found another useful pill. It was a fortunate thing.As for the pill in the blue and white porcelain bottle, after trying it for a while, it naturally didn't have the slightest effect.Han Li exhaled lightly. He took out another gray pill from the purple jade box and held it in his palm.This pill was called the Dark Cloud Pill. Although its effect was to strengthen one's foundation, it was more suitable for those cultivators who cultivated water-attribute cultivation methods. Its effect was quite different from the Horoscope Pill.Han Li pondered for a while, then suddenly stood up and walked out of the secret chamber.When he passed by Liu Le 'er's bedroom, his footsteps stopped.Although there was a door between them, Han Li could still feel the surging spiritual energy inside. It was obvious that she was cultivating hard.He nodded happily and continued to walk out. Soon, he arrived at the alchemy room.This alchemy room wasn't big. It had a circumference of about forty to fifty feet. The floor was greenish-black. In the middle of the room, there was a round block that was half a foot above the ground. There were many dark red patterns carved on it, forming an array.In the middle of the array, there was a black hole. There was a faint flicker of fire, and a scorching aura seeped out from it.In the middle of the round block, there was an alchemy furnace that was half the height of a person. It was emitting wisps of spiritual energy. It was quite extraordinary.Han Li's gaze swept over the place. He then sat down on a praying mat next to the alchemy furnace. He waved his hand and struck out a magic art.The red array suddenly lit up. Then, a bright red earth fire emerged from the black hole and wrapped around the alchemy furnace.Han Li first cleaned the inside and outside of the alchemy furnace. Then, he turned his hand and took out the Dark Cloud Pill. He waved his hand and threw it into the alchemy furnace.He formed a magic art with both hands. The earth fire immediately moved along with his magic art. It split into eight bunches and drilled into the alchemy furnace. Soon, the furnace emitted a strong medicinal fragrance.Han Li's hands did not stop forming the magic art. The medicinal fragrance suddenly became faint.His expression didn't change. He continued to form the magic art with his hands.Half an hour passed in the blink of an eye. The medicinal fragrance emitted from the alchemy furnace was almost gone. Instead, there were other smells. Moreover, it seemed to be a mixture of many smells.Han Li suddenly stopped and struck out a magic art. The fire at the bottom of the alchemy furnace was immediately extinguished.He waved his hand and rolled up the lid of the alchemy furnace. The Dark Cloud Pill inside disappeared. Instead, it was replaced by a small handful of colorful powder.After Han Li looked at it for a moment, he carefully emitted a green light and carried the powder out.The green light gently trembled. Suddenly, countless thin threads appeared inside. It was as if thousands of small hands had reached into the powder and stirred it.Soon, the small handful of powder was divided into more than a dozen parts. Each part had a different color.Han Li nodded. He carefully separated the different powders into more than a dozen small jade boxes that he had prepared in advance.The secret technique he had just used was called Inverse Alchemy Technique. It was an unorthodox secret technique that he had obtained by chance in the Spiritual World. It could refine and decompose elixirs in reverse.The purpose of the person who had created this secret technique was to rely on this technique to decompose other people's elixirs and reverse deduce the elixir recipe.Unfortunately, this person failed in the end. This Inverse Alchemy Technique still had its limits. It was impossible to completely reverse deduce the elixir recipe. It could only reach the level of identifying the elixir's ingredients.After Han Li obtained it, he felt that this technique was quite novel. Since he was an Alchemy Grandmaster, he had memorized it. Today was the first time he had used it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li placed a dozen or so small jade boxes containing different powders aside, waved his hand, and activated the cauldron's formation again. Then, he flipped his hand and took out an elixir. It was the Horoscope Pill.He pondered for a moment, then threw the Horoscope Pill into the cauldron and used the Alchemy Reversal Mantra again.An hour later, the Horoscope Pill turned into a dozen or so different materials and was also put into a jade box.He placed the materials of the two elixirs together and examined them in detail.\"Huh!\"After a moment, Han Li exclaimed softly, and a smile appeared on his face.Comparing the materials of the two elixirs, most of the materials were naturally different, but one of the blue crystalline powder was exactly the same in color and shape. It was obviously the same material.However, the blue crystalline powder in the Horoscope Pill was obviously much more than the Dark Cloud Pill.Both elixirs were useful to him. Although it might not be entirely due to the blue powder's effect, it was definitely closely related to it.Han Li picked up a bit of the blue powder and sniffed it. Then, he put it in his mouth and tasted it. After a careful examination, his brows slowly furrowed.Since the beginning of his cultivation, he had formed an indissoluble bond with elixir refinement. Whether it was the various elixir refinement materials of the human world or the Spiritual Realm, he more or less knew about them. He even dabbled in elixir refinement materials of other realms. However, he had no clue about the blue powder in front of him.\"Perhaps, this is something unique to the Spirit Huan Realm?\"Han Li guessed. After thinking for a moment, he suddenly stood up and quickly walked out of the cave abode.The sky was already dark at this moment.A green light flashed on Han Li's body, and he shot out.After a moment, he landed in front of a cave abode on Dawnfall Peak dozens of miles away.The cave abode's location was rather remote, and there were no signs of human habitation around.Han Li looked around and walked to the cave abode's entrance. He flipped his hand and took out a sound transmission talisman. After whispering a few words, he waved his hand.The sound transmission talisman turned into a white light and flew into the cave abode.After a moment, the door opened with a rumble.\"Elder Gao, Han has troubled you,\" Han Li said with cupped fists.\"Not at all!Friend Han, I didn't think we would meet again so soon. Please, come in. \"Gao Buqian walked out with a smile and invited Han Li into the cave abode.Gao Buji's cave abode was clearly larger than Han Li's, but the furnishings were quite simple, and the entire cave abode was filled with the rich scent of medicinal pills.After Han Li sat down, he said, \"Elder Gao, I'll get straight to the point. I've come because I have a matter I'd like your guidance on.\"\"Fellow Daoist Han, there's no harm in speaking your mind,\" Gao Buji replied.Han Li took out the jade box containing the blue powder and handed it over, saying, \"Elder Gao is quite knowledgeable. Do you recognize this?\"Gao Buji made an 'oh' sound and took the jade box. Looking at it carefully, his eyes narrowed slightly.He picked up a bit of the powder and placed it on his tongue, tasting it. He raised his brow and gave Han Li a deep look.\"Looks like Elder Han has asked the right person.\" Han Li smiled.\"Hehe, you've asked the right person, Fellow Daoist Han.However \u2026 \"Gao Buxie chuckled, hinting at something.Han Li didn't say anything. He took out a spirit stone and threw it to Gao Buqian.Gao Buqian caught the spirit stone, and a smile appeared on his face. He continued, \"I won't lie to you. This is the powder of cloudcrane grass. It's been around for a long time. This grass is one of the main ingredients for many high-level pills in our sect. It's very rare.Plus, your powder seems to have been processed by other methods. Only I'm familiar with all kinds of spiritual ingredients, and I can barely recognize it. \"\"I see... Would you be able to elaborate on the medicinal properties of the Cloudcrane Grass, Elder Gao?\" Han Li nodded with a pensive look before asking.Gao Buqian chuckled. He didn't say anything and rubbed his hands together.Han Li threw another spirit stone to Gao Buqian.Gao Buqian happily accepted the spirit stone. He shook his head and slowly said, \"This cloudcrane grass is also known as the Color Changing Grass. When it's a hundred years old, it's white. When it's a thousand years old, it's blue. When it's three thousand years old, it's red. When it's ten thousand years old, it's dark red. When it's thirty thousand years old, it's purple.The most special thing about this grass is that it can absorb the Qi of the sun. When it's a hundred years old, it will produce a trace of natural purple Qi.Not only is it a necessary item to practice a few powerful techniques, but it can also be converted into natural spiritual energy. It has the effect of cleansing one's body.The older it is, the purer the natural purple Qi and the more amazing the effect. \"\"Natural purple Qi \u2026 I wonder where I can find this grass?\" Han Li's heart skipped a beat.\"This grass grows in a very harsh environment. As far as I know, it can only be found in a few places. These places are all under the control of the major sects.Right now, almost all of the thousand-year-old and older ones are in the hands of the major sects. You can't find it outside. \"Gao Buqian scratched his head and continued.After listening to Gao Buqian, Han Li basically had a conclusion in his heart. The thing that could restore his spiritual energy was most likely the natural purple Qi.\"Other than the Wangxi Dan, what other dans are made from the cloudcrane grass?\" Han Li thought for a moment and asked.This time, Gao Buqian did not beat around the bush. He answered directly, \"Other than this dan, the Dark Cloud Dan also uses it.In addition, the Spiritual Dan and the Emptiness Dan also contain a small amount of young cloudcrane grass. The natural purple Qi contained in them is negligible. \"After parting ways with Gao Buqian, Han Li went straight to the Valley of Ease. He spent a spirit stone and bought a few of the dans that Gao Buqian had mentioned. He also bought a few hundred-year-old cloudcrane grass. Then, he returned to the Peak of the Chu Yun.Inside the secret chamber of the cave.Han Li sat cross-legged on a cattail hassock. In front of him were the dans and cloudcrane grass that he had just bought.He first opened a white porcelain bottle, poured out a Dark Cloud Pill, and swallowed it. Immediately, a warm current rose in his Dantian, and wisps of spiritual power spread out from the pill, gradually transforming into magic power, and was stored.He was overjoyed. He picked up a hundred-year-old cloudcrane grass and put it in his mouth. After chewing a few times, he swallowed it.After about ten minutes, his dantian warmed up again. Strands of spiritual energy gathered in his dantian and were stored again.The corner of Han Li's mouth curled up, revealing a smile. He finally confirmed that the natural purple Qi was the key to restoring his spiritual energy.After a day and a night, when he consumed more than half of the dans and cloudcrane grass that he had bought, his cultivation level gradually increased. Very soon, he was back to the advanced stage of the original level.Just as he was overjoyed and was about to consume the rest of the dans, his expression became sluggish.At this moment, the medicinal energy that had yet to be completely converted in his body was finally turning into spiritual energy and was gathering in his dantian.However, his dantian was now like a tank full of water. It could no longer store any more spiritual energy.He could only watch helplessly as the power lingered in his Dantian for a while before dissipating bit by bit, turning into nothingness.Han Li sighed. He knew that this was most likely related to the change in the original level. It was likely that consuming more dans would not help.As for the reason behind this, he could only figure it out after his physical body and spiritual energy recovered a little.Today, he could no longer rely on cultivation to increase his spiritual energy. Even if he used dans, he could only return to the advanced stage of the original level. How to speed up the recovery of his physical body and spiritual energy became the most important issue.Thinking about this, he felt a headache. His index finger softly rubbed between his brows and he fell into deep thought.After a while, he seemed to suddenly think of something. He raised his head, flipped his wrist, and took out the guest elder token.Han Li sent his spiritual sense into the command medallion, and a map of the Icy Flame Sect's geographical distribution appeared before his eyes from the convergence of golden light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the mountainside of Chu Yun Peak, there were white clouds.A Young disciple in a white robe was walking up the mountain stairs.When he lifted one of his feet and was about to step on a stone step, he suddenly felt dizzy. Then, he stood on the spot and couldn't move. Even his divine sense became blurred.Then, a figure flashed beside him. A tall Young figure suddenly appeared there. It was Han Li.\"Tell me about the situation of the Scripture Pavilion in the sect.\"Han Li's eyes flashed with blue light. He stared at the Young man's eyes and said slowly with a strange voice.\"The Scripture Pavilion is located on Saint Gathering Peak. It's divided into two pavilions.The outer pavilion is open to all disciples and elders, while the inner pavilion only allows inner disciples and elders to enter \u2026 \"The white-robed disciple's eyes were unfocused as he answered dully like a wooden man.Listening to the disciple's words, Han Li's expression didn't change, but a hint of thoughtfulness flashed deep in his eyes.As the most important place of the sect, the Leng Yan Sect's management of the Scripture Pavilion was naturally very strict.On normal days, the disciples and elders of the sect not only needed to pay a lot of spirit stones but also had to deduct the sect's contribution points.The sect's Contribution Points were a measure of the sect's disciples and elders' contributions to the sect. Generally, they were obtained by completing missions issued by the sect. The more difficult the mission, the more Contribution Points one could obtain. Without enough time to accumulate, it was impossible to obtain enough Contribution Points to exchange for high-grade cultivation methods and secret techniques.Therefore, there were always some people who took the unorthodox path and sought other ways.Not long ago, there were also many rogue cultivators with bad intentions who secretly sneaked into the Scripture Pavilion to steal ancient books under the pretext of joining the Leng Yan Sect and becoming an outer elder. As a result, they were all discovered without exception. Their ending was extremely miserable.There was no other reason but that the security measures of the Scripture Pavilion were too strict. These people had no chance at all.According to the white-robed disciple, there were Void Refinement Stage elders stationed in the pavilion all year round and there were people patrolling from time to time. In addition, there were countless powerful restrictions that ordinary cultivators couldn't get close at all.Han Li pondered for a while, then withdrew his finger from the white-robed disciple's forehead. Like a ghost, he disappeared from the spot in an instant.The white-robed disciple who had raised his foot for a long time finally stepped down.He staggered and almost fell.After stabilizing his body, he rubbed his numb calf and looked around blankly. He shook his head in confusion and continued to walk up the mountain.After the time it takes for a stick of incense to burn.Han Li's figure appeared on Saint Gathering Peak. He stood under a tall, verdant cypress tree, looking at a two-story octagonal pavilion in the distance.The pavilion was about ninety feet tall and had eight sides. However, there was only one door in the south.The walls and roof of the pavilion were engraved with a variety of complicated lightning-resistant and fire-resistant runes.Two groups of patrolling cultivators circled the two sides of the pavilion, shuttling back and forth, taking turns to patrol.After staring at it for a long while, a contemplative look appeared on Han Li's face, and his body blurred before disappearing on the spot.That night.In a valley in the depths of the Leng Yan Sect, there was a bluestone hall. From time to time, teams of patrolling disciples would pass by. There were seven or eight teams, and the leaders were all Deity Transformation cultivators. It was obvious that they attached great importance to this place.A patrol team silently flew past the entrance of the valley. The leader, a burly man in an azure robe, seemed a little sleepy and yawned silently.At this moment, a few dozen feet away, another patrol team flew over and patrolled in different directions.The burly man in an azure robe saw this and couldn't help but curl his lips.Although the Heavenly Talisman Hall was an important place of the Leng Yan Sect, it was too cautious to arrange so many patrolling disciples.Not only was the location hidden, but there was also a sect protection formation covering the entire mountain gate. How could anyone sneak in here?He naturally didn't dare to say these words. Instead, he transmitted his voice to the disciples behind him to be vigilant and flew into the valley.At this moment, a thunderclap suddenly sounded in a hall not far from the burly man in an azure robe. Then, a purple lightning burst out and immediately calmed down.The burly man was startled and didn't seem to react.\"Who is it!\"\"Not good! Someone has sneaked into the Heavenly Talisman Hall!\"The patrolling disciples behind the burly man cried out in alarm.The burly man in an azure robe also reacted at this moment. He flew down and arrived outside the hall in a flash.\"Who dares to break into the Heavenly Talisman Hall? Quickly surrender!\"The burly man shouted loudly. He gripped a magic weapon in his hand and waved his hand. The patrolling disciples behind him dispersed and surrounded the hall.Whoosh! Whoosh!The other patrolling disciples also flew over and surrounded the hall. There were seven or eight teams in total. Hundreds of people surrounded the hall so tightly that not even a fly would be able to escape.The hall was pitch-black and didn't have the slightest movement.All the halls here were shrouded by a restrictive spell. So, the spirit sense couldn't penetrate inside.The leaders looked at each other. They couldn't make up their minds whether they should rush in or not.They were patrolling disciples and didn't have the qualifications to set foot in here.\"What happened?\" A white light flew over and landed outside the hall. Then, the figure of a white-haired old man appeared.\"Master Fan, you're here. Someone has just broken into the Heavenly Talisman Hall.We are about to go in and search, but according to the rules, we are not qualified to go in. \"One of the leaders walked to the side of the old man and said quickly.\"What!A group of idiots. Why are you still following the rules at this time? What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go in! \"The white-haired old man immediately roared in anger and rushed into the hall.When the leaders saw this, most of them immediately followed. However, two of them stayed outside.When the white-haired old man rushed to the entrance of the hall, he was startled.The restrictive spell on the main entrance of the hall was actually intact.The old man felt strange. However, he didn't have time to think about it. He took out a token and a white light flew out from it and fell on the door.The door flashed and opened with a squeak.The leaders immediately rushed into the hall. The white-haired old man waved his hand and shot a magic technique.The hall immediately bloomed with white light, illuminating the inside of the hall.Everyone was stunned. The furnishings in the hall were simple. There were only a dozen white jade shelves. They could see through them at a glance.There was no one here!There were a few scorch marks on the ground.\"No one?Did he escape? \"The leaders saw this and couldn't help but look at each other.The cyan-robed man was also in the hall. His eyes were wide open and full of disbelief.When the accident happened, he was right next to the hall and his eyes never left it for a second. How did that person escape?\"Ah!Celestial Shadow Stone!Moongazing Grass! \"The white-haired old man rushed to a white jade shelf. His face was pale and his lips were trembling.These white jade shelves were filled with materials. There were restrictive spells around the shelves. However, the restrictive spells on two of the shelves had been broken and the materials on them were a lot less.\"Billowing Wood, Iron Feather!\" The old man ran to another shelf and beat his chest and stamped his feet. He was extremely distressed.The Semi-God Realm leaders' faces didn't look good either.\"Go after him! Mobilize all the patrolling disciples. We must catch this thief for me!\" The white-haired old man stomped his feet and shouted angrily.\u2026A large number of precious talisman-making materials were stolen from the Heavenly Talisman Hall. It caused a great uproar in the Leng Yan Sect. Countless patrolling disciples were dispatched to search for the thief.The operation to catch the thief lasted from midnight until dawn. Later, many outer disciples were woken up and joined the search.As a result, the entire Spirit Flame Mountain Range was turned upside down, but no trace of the thief was found.This matter soon alarmed the sect's higher-ups. A late Void Refinement Stage elder who was good at tracking came to the Heavenly Talisman Hall. After investigation, he determined that the thief escaped using a lightning teleportation formation. There was no trace left, so he couldn't track him.Seeing that even the late-Spatial Tempering elders were unable to find the thief, there was no way a Body Integration Stage grand elder would be alerted by such a trivial matter. Only then did Master Fan of the Heavenly Talisman Hall resentfully stop his arrest.Although the search was over, the sect naturally wouldn't let it go so easily.The protective formation around the Spirit Flame Mountain Range didn't show any signs of being broken. Naturally, the thief was still in the mountain range. The Leng Yan Sect secretly sent experts to search for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree days passed in the blink of an eye.It was night again.The Leng Yan Sect's Sutra Depository.Ever since the Heavenly Talisman Hall incident, the number of patrolling guards had doubled.In a dense forest a few hundred feet away from the pavilion, a faint silvery figure slowly emerged. Under the cover of the night, the face couldn't be seen clearly, only the eyebrows and eyes could be vaguely seen.The figure raised his head and looked at the octagonal pavilion that seemed somewhat mysterious in the night. After a while, he turned his hand and took out a pale purple talisman, and stuck it on his body.The purple talisman suddenly broke into pieces, and turned into a few vague tadpole-shaped talisman characters. They flew up and down around the figure, and then merged into his body.Suddenly, a purple mist appeared around the figure, and instantly submerged his figure, making him disappear into thin air.Of course, the figure didn't really disappear, but turned into a group of nothingness, and directly floated in the direction of the Sutra Depository, ignoring the patrolling guards around.Although the patrolling guards looked around from time to time, and their spirit sense constantly swept every corner of the surroundings, they couldn't find the existence of the figure at all.It didn't take long for the figure to float to the entrance of the Sutra Depository.It was already late at night, and the Sutra Depository had already been closed. The wide stone door was glimmering, and it was obviously covered with a restrictive spell.The figure muttered something, and made a hand sign. Then, he opened his mouth and spouted a group of almost invisible green gas, hitting the door.If the green gas was magnified a hundred times, it could be seen that the green gas was composed of countless incomparably small talisman characters. As soon as the talisman touched the restrictive spell on the door, these tiny talisman characters merged into it.The restrictive light curtain seemed to be corroded, and a big hole appeared. The figure immediately flew into it silently.The stone door without a restrictive spell was useless, and the figure disappeared into the stone door.The restrictive spell on the door flashed, and immediately restored to its original state.All of this happened in a flash, and the patrolling guards outside didn't notice anything unusual.The figure entered the Sutra Depository, and a circular hall appeared in front of him.The hall was very large, almost twenty or thirty feet wide. There were more than a dozen paths extending from the hall, and no one knew where they led.In the deepest part, there was a pitch-black staircase, winding up to the top.The silhouette glanced around before flying towards a passageway silently.The passage was not long, and he soon reached the end. In front of him was a tightly shut stone chamber.The door of the stone chamber was covered with a layer of white restrictive spell just like the outside.On the top of the door, there was a white jade slab with the words \"Cultivation Technique\" carved on it.A look of joy flashed in the figure's eyes. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of green Qi. Just like before, the green Qi corroded a large hole in the white barrier, and the figure immediately flew into it.Behind the stone door was a very large stone room. There were hundreds of bookshelves inside, and they were all covered by a layer of faint red light.Each bookshelf was divided into several compartments, and each compartment contained a jade slip.There was a label next to each grid, introducing what kind of cultivation method was recorded in the jade slips inside.The silhouette casually walked to the front of a bookshelf, opened his mouth, and spouted a green gas, corroding a big hole in the faint red light curtain around the bookshelf. Then, he waved his hand and released a suction force, sucking a few jade slips into his hand. His Divine Sense seeped into them.After a while, he frowned and threw the jade slips back onto the bookshelf.The cultivation methods recorded in the jade slips were Core Formation and even Nascent Soul cultivation methods, but it seemed that this person did not care about them.The figure walked around the stone chamber, and not long after, he roughly examined the jade slips on the bookshelves. Then, he shook his head in disappointment.Without hesitation, he turned around and flew outside. He quickly passed through the stone door, and a moment later, he returned to the main hall.He immediately entered another passage on the side, and at the end of the passage was another stone chamber.There was also a white stone slab at the top of the stone chamber, and the word \"Cultivation Technique\" was written on it.The figure used the same method, and very quickly, he broke the restriction on the door and entered again.Not long after, the figure returned and entered the third passage.In the blink of an eye, more than two hours passed, and the figure had examined all of the passages. His eyebrows were tightly furrowed, and it seemed that he did not find what he was looking for.The figure slowly floated to the pitch-black staircase in the deepest part of the cave. He glanced up and slowly flew up.The staircase was not long, and he soon reached the end. There was a huge stone door that was several feet wide.There were two people sitting cross-legged on both sides of the door.The one on the left was white and fat, with a fat head and big ears. He was wearing a purple kasaya, and he seemed to be a monk. The one on the right was tall and thin, and his skin was yellow and sallow. He looked very sick.However, there was a faint brilliance above their heads, and the aura they exuded was as deep as the sea. They were two powerhouses at the Void Training Stage!They closed their eyes and meditated, unaware of what was happening below.The figure glanced at them, and then his eyes moved away and fell on the stone door behind them.Wave-like light appeared on the stone door, reflecting colorful light. It seemed that the restriction on this door was much more powerful than that of the other stone chambers below.If he guessed correctly, behind this stone door was most likely the cabinet of the Sutras Pavilion of the Leng Yan Sect, where the most exquisite books and records of the Leng Yan Sect were stored. It seemed that it would not be easy to break the restriction here.The figure narrowed his eyes and paused for a moment. Then, he moved forward again and landed in front of the door as if he was weightless. He was less than three feet away from the two Void Training Stage cultivators.At this moment, the fat monk on the left raised his eyebrows slightly. He could not help but open his eyes and look around.The tall and thin man on the right also opened his eyes and asked, \"What's wrong, Brother Lingxi?\"\"Nothing.\" The fat monk looked back at the door of the cabinet and murmured to himself.He did not really find anything. It was just a kind of feeling that originated from his heart triggered by a secret technique he had cultivated. However, the success rate of this technique was not very high. Moreover, there were layers of restrictions here, and the two of them were guarding this place day and night. Not to mention a cultivator at the Form Synthesis Stage, even if a cultivator at the Great Vehicle Stage wanted to covet this place, he would not be able to do it without making a sound.With this thought, the monk slowly closed his eyes again.The tall and thin man didn't pay much attention to this and also closed his eyes to cultivate.The figure stood still in the same place from beginning to end. Only after the two Void Training Stage cultivators closed their eyes to cultivate did his glabella fluctuate slightly. A powerful spiritual sense was released from his glabella and quickly covered the entire door, faintly condensing into a protective barrier.Then, he opened his mouth to expel a burst of azure Qi, which fell onto the rippling water restriction on the door.The rippling water restriction immediately flashed with light, as if it was resisting the invasion of the azure Qi. However, the two Void Training Stage cultivators outside the spiritual sense barrier were completely unaware of this.The figure made a hand seal and the azure Qi fluctuated in a myriad of ways. It clashed with the rippling water restriction, causing the area in the center of the restriction to fade a little.Without saying a word, the figure flashed and disappeared into the door.All of this seemed complicated, but from the moment he broke through the restriction to the moment he entered the door, only a few breaths had passed. At this moment, the spiritual sense barrier quietly dissipated.\"Huh?\"The fat monk raised his eyebrows and opened his eyes again. He suddenly looked back at the door of the cabinet behind him.The rippling water restriction on the surface of the door was sparkling, emitting a dense light, and there was no abnormality.However, there was a clear ominous feeling in his heart just now. Although it was only a flash, he couldn't help but feel suspicious.\"Brother Lingxi, did you find something?\"The tall and thin man also seemed to notice something was wrong at this time. He quickly stood up and looked back at the door, then closed his eyes again. His huge spiritual sense swept in all directions without reservation.\"Brother Qing Tao, did you find anything wrong just now?\" The fat monk walked to the door of the cabinet, carefully looked for a moment, and asked.\"Unless \u2026 someone can fly out of the Scripture Pavilion for hundreds of miles in two or three breaths, or break the Glaze Profound Water Array that the Cold Flame Ancestor personally set up and enter the cabinet.\" The tall and thin man had already opened his eyes at this moment, shook his head, and said slowly.Obviously, his spiritual sense search just now was also fruitless.\"How is this possible?It seems that it is my illusion. \"Hearing this, the fat monk couldn't help but shake his head with a wry smile.If he wanted to break the Glaze Profound Water Formation silently in two or three breaths and restore it to normal, he was afraid that even the Great Elder of the Dacheng Stage in the sect might not be able to do it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust as the two Spatial Tempering cultivators were feeling suspicious, the figure had already appeared in a black hall.The hall wasn't very large, only around 200 to 300 feet in size. There was a thick white jade pillar at the center of the hall, which was engraved with countless runes. A soft yellow light radiated from the top of the stone pillar, forming a yellow light barrier in the shape of an upside-down bowl. A dozen or so red Stone cabinets could be vaguely seen inside, but the contents of the cabinets couldn't be clearly seen, making it appear rather mysterious.The figure stood in place and didn't take a step forward. He carefully examined the yellow light barrier in front of him, his eyes faintly glowing with blue light.A moment later, he waved his hand and several tens of black lights flew out. These were black formation flags, which landed around the yellow light barrier in an orderly manner. He then made an incantation gesture with both hands and black pillars of light flew out from the surrounding formation flags, connecting in mid-air to form an even larger hemispherical black light barrier that enveloped the entire yellow light barrier.The yellow light barrier had originally occupied nearly half of the space in the hall, and the faint black light barrier had almost filled the entire hall.The figure opened his mouth and spat out a burst of azure Qi, which landed on the yellow light barrier in an attempt to break a hole like before.To his surprise, when the azure Qi corroded a palm-sized hole, the surface of the light barrier immediately shone brightly. Countless rays of yellow light appeared out of thin air, enveloping the azure Qi.At the same time, the runes on the white jade pillar at the center of the light barrier suddenly lit up.The surface of the yellow light barrier shone brightly, and countless dazzling thin yellow threads of light appeared, entangling the azure Qi before fiercely constricting it.The azure Qi was immediately cut into countless fragments and dispersed. The yellow light also quickly faded, and the hole that had previously appeared also quickly closed.The figure was indifferent to this scene, as if he wasn't surprised at all. He stared at the white jade pillar for a long time, then flipped his hand and took out a dozen or so formation flags of different colors.With a wave of his hand, all of the formation flags floated in mid-air, arranging themselves into a strange oval formation. It seemed to be disorderly, but there was a hidden mystery in it.The figure quickly made an incantation gesture with both hands, and black light flashed incessantly in his hands.More than a dozen Array Flags also blossomed with various colors of light. Like javelins, they struck the yellow light barrier one after another, and drilled into it like nails, encircling an area of about ten feet.The surface of the yellow light shield flashed wildly, causing the advancing speed of the formation flag to greatly slow down. At the same time, a rather strong wave of magic power spread out. However, these waves slightly touched the light black light shield outside, and disappeared without a trace, like a clay ox entering the sea, and did not spread outside at all.As the figure chanted an obscure incantation, the surface of the dozen or so formation flags lit up and their speed increased. Finally, they were completely embedded in the light barrier.In the next moment, the yellow light on the surface of the area enveloped by the formation flag quickly dimmed.The figure immediately opened his mouth and spat out a cloud of green gas, which landed in this area.The dim light shield had no resistance at all, and in the blink of an eye, more than half of it was corroded by the green gas.However, the runes on the white jade pillar in the middle flashed wildly at this moment, and the other areas of the yellow light shield shone brightly. More yellow rays of light emerged, and rushed towards the area that was surrounded by more than a dozen formation flags like a raging wave. However, it was blocked by the formation flags.The fierce magic power spread out, and was blocked by the surrounding black light shield. However, this time, the magic power fluctuations were too fierce, and the black light shield also trembled with a buzzing sound. Moreover, it was getting more and more intense, and it seemed that it could not bear it.Fortunately, after two or three breaths, a big hole was corroded by the green gas in that area of about ten feet.The figure quickly rushed in, and landed near the white jade pillar. He opened his mouth and spat out a thick black gas, which wrapped the stone pillar. At the same time, he made an incantation gesture with both hands, and a black incantation gesture flew out, and hit the stone pillar.The black gas quickly spread on the stone pillar, and the rune pattern on it was dyed black.The light on the stone pillar immediately dimmed, and the surging rays of light on the yellow light shield slowly subsided. Everything returned to its original state.The figure waved his hand, and more than a dozen formation flags emerged from the light shield, and flew back to his hand, and was put away.His action did not stop. He turned his hand, and took out a stack of yellow formation flags. They turned into more than a dozen rays of light, and flew out, and hit the yellow light shield from the inside.These formation flags submerged into the light shield without any resistance, and disappeared.The entire yellow light shield slightly fluctuated, and then returned to its original state. The big hole that had been corroded by the green gas also quickly recovered.The figure turned his head, and looked at the more than ten stone cabinets distributed around the stone pillar.Each stone cabinet was impressively shrouded in a layer of dark red light shield.The figure walked in front of a stone cabinet, and without much hesitation, he opened his mouth and spat out a green gas, which fell on the surface of the light shield. The area immediately fluctuated violently, and the red light quickly faded. It seemed that the light shield was about to be broken.At this moment, the surface of the red light shield suddenly emerged with white crystal lights. The red and white lights intertwined, and suddenly resisted the erosion of the green gas.At the same time, a shrill bell sounded from the depths of the hall.The void around the figure fluctuated, and it seemed that he was also taken aback.But the next moment, a muffled incantation came out of his mouth, and his hands kept changing.The green gas immediately tumbled, and changed into various shapes. It quickly attacked the red and white restriction, but no matter how much the green gas changed, it couldn't break through.The figure suddenly waved his hand, and decisively recalled the green gas. Then, he pointed two fingers at his eyebrows, and a black crack suddenly appeared between his eyebrows. Then, it split open, and a pitch-black eyeball emerged.The eyeball turned slightly, and a black rune appeared in it.Xiu!Then, a finger-thick streak of black light darted out of it, and struck the restrictive spell outside the stone cabinet in a flash.The red and white restriction was like a piece of paper in front of the black light. It was immediately penetrated, and broke into pieces with a \"bang\" sound.The figure's eyebrows flashed, and a huge power of Divine Sense was emitted. Then, it split into more than a dozen parts, and each of them submerged into a jade slip, and quickly explored the contents inside.With the sound of the bell, the restriction outside the Scriptures Pavilion immediately flashed, and issued a burst of warning sounds.\"Not good!Someone broke into the Scriptures Pavilion! \"\"Who is so audacious? He's simply courting death!\"\"Could it be the thief who sneaked into the Heavenly Talisman Hall two days ago?\"Following a series of angry roars, one figure after another gathered towards the Sutra Depository from all directions.With the example of the Heavenly Talisman Hall, these patrolling people did not hesitate. They sent people to inform the sect's higher-ups, and the strongest captains immediately broke into the Scriptures Pavilion.In the dark night, everywhere in the Leng Yan Sect lit up, and there was a commotion.The first people to react were actually the two Void Refinement cultivators at the door of the Cabinet.As the alarm bell rang, the two immediately jumped up, and their faces showed a mixture of shock and anger.Someone had actually snuck into the Cabinet under their noses!\"Could it be a Great Ascension cultivator?\"This thought flashed in the minds of the two, but at this moment, they couldn't care about anything else. They immediately took out a jade talisman, one shaped like a crescent moon, and the other was oblate.The two jade talismans fit together, forming a complete circle. Without saying anything, they stuck it somewhere on the door.The water ripples on the door flickered, and quickly disappeared. The stone door suddenly opened, and the two flew in without saying anything.When they saw the faint black light screen inside, the two were startled.The fat monk's mind raced, and he fiercely gritted his teeth. He flipped his hand and took out a magic treasure, a round mirror.He formed an incantation gesture with his hand, and the round mirror flashed with grey light, shooting out a thick greyish-white light beam. It hit the black light screen, and a deafening explosion sounded.The light screen immediately shook violently, like waves, but it did not immediately collapse.Almost at the same time, four azure flying swords flew out of the tall and thin man's body. They circled in the air, and turned into four azure lotus flowers.Countless azure sword Qi flew out of the four azure lotus flowers, and slashed at the black light screen.Pu pu!The black light screen finally could not withstand it, and was torn apart, revealing the situation inside.\"Bold thief!\"When the two Void Refinement cultivators saw the faint silver figure inside, their hearts relaxed, and they couldn't help but feel ashamed and angry.The aura emitted by the figure was only at the Nascent Soul stage!However, the person didn't seem to care about the two Void Refinement cultivators outside. At this moment, he had just finished looking at the jade slips in the first stone cabinet. His figure flashed, and he came to the side of the other stone cabinet.In the same way, a black light shot out from the eye between his eyebrows, and broke the restrictions around the stone cabinet. Then, he calmly released his spiritual sense, and once again explored the jade slips.\u2026 \u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Die!\"The fat monk and the tall and thin man roared at the same time. The fat monk took out a yellow jade tablet and waved it.Chi la!A yellow light shot out from the surface of the jade tablet and landed on the yellow light barrier in a flash.The light barrier immediately split in the middle, revealing a passage that was about six meters wide.The two of them flew out and pounced towards the figure inside.At this moment, the figure suddenly raised his hand and chanted an incantation. He pointed a finger.A black light flew out from his fingertip and hit the white jade pillar in the middle.The restriction runes on the jade pillar suddenly lit up and the yellow light barrier shone brightly. Countless rays of yellow light shot out and engulfed the two Void Refinement cultivators in mid-air.The two of them felt as if they had fallen into a swamp. Their bodies suddenly became a hundred times heavier and it became extremely difficult to even lift their hands.\"Oh no, this formation has been modified!\" The tall and thin man exclaimed.\"Who are you?How do you know how to control the restriction here? \"The fat monk's face was gloomy and he shouted angrily.The figure ignored him and quickly read the jade slip with his spiritual sense. His hands kept making hand seals and hitting the white stone pillar.The yellow light immediately fluctuated and rotated with the two Void Refinement cultivators at the center. It formed two yellow vortexes and firmly imprisoned their bodies.The two of them roared and struggled with all their might. At the same time, the magic treasures in their hands flashed and shot out grey light beams and green sword Qi in an attempt to break free from the yellow light. However, no matter how hard they attacked, they could not break free.The two of them were both angry and anxious in their hearts. This Yellow Mist Restriction was originally used to deal with external enemies, but now it had unexpectedly appeared right in front of them and had instead become a huge problem that trapped them.At this moment, seven or eight figures swarmed in from the outside. They were the Deity Transformation Stage patrol captains.When they saw the situation inside, they were even more dumbfounded.However, they quickly reacted and raised their hands to take out magic treasures to attack the yellow light barrier. They tried to break it and save the two Void Refinement cultivators.\"Stop! You can't attack it!\" The fat monk's expression changed and he cried out.However, it was already too late. Seven or eight magic treasures bombarded the yellow mist, causing it to tremble.But at the same time, bumps the size of millstones appeared on the yellow mist.\"Puff! Puff!\" Seven or eight tentacle-like multicolored lights shot out like lightning and wrapped around several people. Then, they suddenly retracted and dragged them into the multicolored light.Their cultivation bases were inferior to the two Spatial Tempering cultivators, so they were completely immobilized by the multicolored light.\"Damn it!\" The fat, white monk roared.\"Have you informed the sect of the situation here?\" The tall and skinny man asked the few patrol captains.\"Already \u2026 informed \u2026\" Those Soul Formation captains found it very difficult to open their mouths and said with difficulty.The two Void Refinement Realm cultivators were relieved to hear this and turned to look at the figure.The figure was still constantly breaking the restrictions on the stone cabinet and quickly reading the jade slips on the cabinet. His speed was extremely fast. In just a moment, he had already read most of the ancient books in the cabinet.Although the two of them were extremely anxious in their hearts, everyone present was trapped by the yellow mist restriction. They could only watch helplessly without being able to do anything.\"Who dares!\"At this moment, a thunderous roar came from outside. The air in the hall trembled violently and the yellow light was also shaken by the roar.The ears of the dozen or so people in the yellow mist restriction buzzed and their faces turned pale. However, they were overjoyed.The figure standing in front of one of the stone cabinets stiffened and looked outside. Then, the vertical eye on his forehead shone with black light.Whoosh! Whoosh!Whoosh! Several streaks of black light shot out and destroyed the restrictions on the three stone cabinets.Boom!A crimson figure shot out from the door. It was a red-haired man.This person was six meters tall and was as majestic as an iron tower. He wore a crimson robe that was burning with raging flames. The entire hall was instantly plunged into a terrifying temperature.A huge pressure was emitted from the man's body. He was a Body Integration cultivator.\"Scoundrel, die!\"The red-haired man swept his gaze towards the figure. His eyes seemed to be burning as he let out a roar.He grabbed with one hand and a huge burning sword flew out. In a flash, it became tens of meters long and slashed at the yellow barrier with a momentum that could split mountains and split seas.A large amount of yellow light appeared and faced the huge sword in an attempt to block it. However, before it could touch the sword, it was torn apart by the flames on the body of the sword.\"Crack!\"The huge flaming sword fiercely slashed at the yellow barrier. Immediately, countless cracks appeared on the barrier. However, it did not completely shatter and blocked the attack.At this moment, the figure waved his hand and released a suction force.The jade slips on the three stone cabinets immediately flew over and landed firmly in the figure's hand. He turned his hand and put them away.When the red-haired man saw this, he was furious. He formed a hand seal and the huge flaming sword suddenly doubled in size. Flames soared tens of meters high.With a bang, the yellow barrier was completely shattered.The two Void Refinement cultivators and the group of Deity Transformation cultivators felt their bodies relax. They finally regained their freedom.The huge flaming sword paused for a moment. Then, it continued to slash at the black figure.The figure suddenly raised his head and the vertical eye between his eyebrows shone brightly. Countless black runes appeared in it and a thick black light flew out from it. It hit the huge sword.\"Peng!\" The black light exploded!The flames on the huge sword suddenly stopped and dissipated. At the same time, ripples appeared in the surrounding space, causing the huge sword to stop in mid-air.\"Law Eye of Destruction!\" The red-haired man was startled.The figure formed a hand seal and muttered an incantation. Suddenly, a large amount of purple lightning appeared on the surface of his body. It suddenly spread and turned into a lightning formation with him as the center. The formation shone brightly and issued a loud thunderclap. This caused the figure to become somewhat blurry.\"Where do you think you're going?!\"The red-haired man let out a furious roar. The flames on the huge sword soared again. The body of the sword trembled and suddenly split into two.A flaming sword shadow of the same size as the huge sword suddenly slashed down. Its speed was several times faster than the huge flaming sword and it struck the lightning formation.\"Bang!\" The dazzling red light exploded with a loud sound. A violent airflow spread in all directions.The two Void Refinement cultivators' bodies shook violently. They retreated a few steps before they could stabilize their bodies. The seven or eight Deity Transformation cultivators' knees gave out and they knelt down. The spiritual light protecting their bodies trembled violently. They were completely unable to stand.The red light scattered and a deep mark was left on the ground. However, the black figure had already disappeared.Everyone's expression changed. They looked at each other in dismay. Then, they looked at the red-haired man.The red-haired man's face turned ashen. Flames of fury rose in his eyes.At this moment, in the center of the secret chamber of Han Li's cave abode.A large purple formation was engraved on the ground. Wisps of lightning were circulating in the formation. Han Li sat cross-legged beside the formation with his eyes closed.The purple formation suddenly lit up, emitting a dazzling electric light. With a loud thunderclap, a figure wrapped in black Qi emerged from within.Han Li suddenly opened his eyes. A hint of joy flashed in his eyes. He waved his hand and cast a spell.The black Qi around the black figure quickly dissipated. It revealed a silver-armored soldier with dull eyes. It was a talisman soldier.Half of the silver-armored soldier's body was destroyed. It was on the verge of collapse.Han Li waved his hand. Twenty to thirty jade slips flew out of the armored soldier's body and fell into his hand.He put away the jade slips. Then, he stretched out his hand and pointed at the glabella of the armored soldier.A black light flashed. An egg-sized black bead flew out from the glabella. There was a silver airflow slowly flowing inside it.At the same time, the armored soldier's body flashed. It collapsed and turned into a broken silver talisman and a purple talisman. They floated down at the same time.The silver talisman was the Armor Origin Talisman. The purple talisman was the High Zenith Invisibility Talisman. Han Li sneaked into the Heavenly Talisman Hall a few days ago. He stole the materials inside and refined them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li put away the two talismans with a wave of one hand, then he sat down cross-legged and stuck the black bead between his eyebrows with two fingers.The silver smoke in the bead suddenly flew out of the bead, and after circling slightly between his eyebrows, it went into it.Under a closer look, the silver smoke was actually countless tiny characters that were smaller than mosquitoes. They were the books of cultivation methods and secret skills that the Armor Talisman puppet had peeped at in the Scripture Pavilion, which were also the accumulation of the entire Leng Yan Sect over the years.With so much content, even with Han Li's powerful Divine Sense, it was impossible to absorb it all at once.But he was not in a hurry, he had plenty of time to study it slowly.Time slowly passed by, but Han Li remained motionless for three days and three nights.It was not until the morning of the fourth day that he slowly opened his eyes and frowned slightly.Although some of these books were quite exquisite, and some of them were so wonderful that he could not help but admire them, for the current him, they were of no use.Han Li shook his head, and after putting away the black bead, he shook his sleeve, and thirty or forty jade slips appeared on the ground. They were the ones that the Armor Talisman puppet took away at the last moment.His gaze slowly swept over these jade slips, and his expression was a little complicated, hoping to find something useful to him in these jade slips.Thinking so, Han Li picked up a jade slip, and his Divine Sense gradually probed into it.Another whole day passed like this.When Han Li's Divine Sense withdrew from the last jade slip, his eyes showed undisguised disappointment.Most of these thirty or forty jade slips recorded some profound and mysterious cultivation methods, but there was still nothing useful to him now.Han Li smiled bitterly. He had gone through so much trouble to get so many books from the Leng Yan Sect, and almost alarmed the entire sect, but in the end, it was all for naught.He shook his head, and with a wave of his sleeve, he was ready to destroy all these jade slips.Although he had just checked, and there should be no restriction left on them that could be traced, but this Spirit Huan World had such a strange thing as the Innate Purple Qi, it was hard to guarantee that there was no method that even he could not discover, so it was better to destroy them.\"Huh?\" Han Li was startled.More than thirty jade slips were reduced to a pile of powder, but one of the seemingly ordinary jade slips was actually intact.He pondered for a moment, then curiously picked up the jade slip and carefully examined it.Even a piece of fine iron would have been shattered by that casual touch, yet this small jade slip was completely unscathed.However, there was nothing special about the jade slip. It was made of ordinary jade, and he had already read the contents of the jade slip. It was just a body refinement cultivation method suitable for Spatial Tempering Stage cultivators.Han Li looked at the yellow jade scroll and squeezed it with his fingers.Suddenly, a layer of faint star-like radiance emerged on the surface of the yellow jade slip, resisting his strength.His eyes lit up and he stopped. The starlight immediately disappeared.There was indeed something special about this item!He could sense that the starlight was not a restriction used for tracking.Han Li looked at the jade strip in his hand, and with a thought, his Spiritual Consciousness once again entered it.There was something special about this item. The cultivation method recorded inside might be extraordinary, and he might not have discovered it before.In the end, he read the contents of the cultivation method three to four times, and even tried to cultivate it, but in the end, he still did not discover anything hidden.\"Could it be that I'm thinking too much \u2026\"Han Li muttered to himself, but he was unwilling to give up. A crystal light flashed between his eyebrows, and a huge wave of Spiritual Consciousness flew out and wrapped around the jade slip. He carefully examined it inch by inch again.At this moment, the starlight on the jade slip appeared again, and it emitted a devouring force, which actually swallowed his Spiritual Consciousness continuously.Immediately after, a dot of golden light appeared on the surface of the jade slip.Han Li was shocked at first, but then he was overjoyed. He did not retract his Spiritual Consciousness, and let the jade slip devour it.As time passed, his expression gradually became astonished.The jade slip was like a bottomless pit. It had already swallowed nearly one-fifth of his Spiritual Consciousness power, and it was still not satisfied. The dot of golden light also became the size of a broad bean.His Spiritual Consciousness was now damaged, and it was only about 10% of its peak state. However, because of the cultivation method he cultivated, it was not much worse than ordinary Immortals. This jade slip unexpectedly swallowed so much Spiritual Consciousness power.Although it would inevitably take a lot of time to recover later, he only thought about it for a moment and continued to devour it.After a while, an amazing scene appeared!As the golden light on the jade slip increased and filled the entire jade slip, it gradually formed a golden pattern of the Big Dipper.At this time, the devouring force emitted by the jade slip suddenly stopped.Han Li breathed a sigh of relief and was overjoyed to pick up the brand new jade slip. His Spiritual Consciousness once again explored it, and he couldn't help but stare.The contents of the jade slip also changed at this moment. The original countless small yellow characters disappeared, and a large number of golden characters appeared.\"This \u2026\" Han Li was startled and quickly read it.After a full fifteen minutes, he raised his head, and his eyes were full of joy.The small golden characters in the jade slip recorded a body-tempering secret technique called \"Little Big Dipper Origin Technique.\"According to the information left by the Cold Flame Ancestor, this technique did not belong to the Spirit Huan Realm, but was an authentic Immortal World technique. It was specially found by the ancestor after he ascended, and then passed down to the lower realm.What was worth noting was that this technique did not rely on the spiritual power of heaven and earth, but on condensing the power of starlight into the body to temper it.The entire technique was divided into seven levels, and with each level, one could condense a profound aperture. When all seven levels were perfected, one could condense seven great profound apertures, cultivate a True Extreme Body, and cultivate to become a legendary Profound Immortal.His Nascent Soul was currently mutated, and he could not use the spiritual power of heaven and earth to cultivate, but perhaps he could try using the power of starlight.However, at the end, the Cold Flame Ancestor specifically pointed out that if one used the power of starlight to temper their body, they would have to suffer the great pain of starlight piercing their body at all times.Moreover, this technique was not orthodox. It could greatly strengthen the body, but it could not be used to increase the cultivation of magic power through this technique. Those who did not want to put their lives on the line would not want to cultivate this technique. After cultivating it, they could only walk on the Profound Immortal Path, which was far more difficult than ordinary Immortals.Most importantly, cultivating this technique not only required a certain tyrannical body as the foundation, but also a powerful divine sense to guide the power of starlight into the body. Therefore, those who did not have a powerful divine sense could not cultivate this technique.When the Cold Flame Ancestor passed down this technique from the Immortal World, he set up a special restriction on the jade slip. Only those with enough divine sense could see through the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique.Han Li held the jade slip tightly, and he was slightly excited. He felt as if there was a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel.This Little Big Dipper Origin Technique seemed to be tailor-made for him. Although the jade slip said that it would be extremely painful to cultivate, he did not hesitate at all.But at this moment, the jade slip in his hand suddenly shattered and turned into a ball of dazzling golden light.Han Li's pupils shrank when he saw this, and he looked up.The golden light floated in the air, and with a slight distortion, it transformed into a golden figure. It was a burly middle-aged man with a square face and a beard on his cheeks. He gave off a dignified aura.Han Li was shocked. He had seen the portrait of this person in front of him in the sect. It was the Cold Flame Ancestor!\"Good!Good!Good!My painstaking efforts were not in vain. Finally, there is someone who can break this restriction!Which peak's disciple are you from?What's your name? \"the Cold Flame Ancestor looked at Han Li and asked with a smile.\"I am \u2026\" Han Li's mind raced, and he decided to first deceive him.The person in front of him was clearly a clone left behind by the Ancestor's divine sense, but he still gave him a considerable sense of oppression. His combat power was probably not to be underestimated.\"Huh!\"The Cold Flame Ancestor suddenly made a sound of surprise, interrupting Han Li's words. He looked Han Li up and down. His eyes suddenly turned cold, and he asked:\"Why don't you have the slightest aura of the sect's cultivation method on you?Could it be that you are not an inner sect direct disciple? \"the Cold Flame Ancestor asked.\"Reporting to the Ancestor, this one is a guest elder who recently joined the sect. I haven't had the time to cultivate any of the sect's cultivation methods.\" Han Li frowned in his heart, but he quickly said on the surface.\"Guest elder?How could an outer sect elder get the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique's jade slip? \"the Cold Flame Ancestor asked in a cold voice.Han Li could not help but be speechless for a while.The Cold Flame Ancestor's eyes turned and looked at Han Li's feet.There was a pile of sparkling powder there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Icy Flame Patriarch waved a hand through the air, and a burst of golden light swept forth, sweeping up all of the translucent powder in front of Han Li before transforming it into a ball of faint golden light that hovered before him.The Icy Flame Ancestor raised her head and coldly asked, \"These are the sect's secret technique jade slips. How did they fall into your hands? Could it be that you snuck into the sect's Hidden Scripture Pavilion and stole them?\"Although the jade slips had been turned to dust by Han Li, the Icy Flame Ancestor was still able to infer their contents from the slightest trace.The corner of Han Li's mouth twitched and he sighed, \"There's no need to be angry, Fellow Icy Flame. I can give you an explanation for this.\"\"How dare you speak to me as an equal!\"The Icy Flame Ancestor was enraged when she heard this. She didn't do anything, but golden light suddenly shone from between her eyebrows. Countless ripples of crystalline light flew out and instantly condensed into a three-meter-wide golden flower illusion.The golden flower slowly rotated and the center of the flower flashed with light, shooting a nearly transparent golden beam of light towards Han Li's head at an incredible speed.Everywhere it passed, ripples would appear in the air like still water.Han Li stood in place and didn't dodge. He only slightly raised his head and crystal light flashed from between his eyebrows, shooting out an invisible ripple to meet the golden beam of light.\"Pu!\" A soft sound rang out, and the void shook violently, causing a circular ripple to appear.The golden light pillar seemed to have collided with something. It shattered layer by layer from head to tail, and the invisible ripples also dissipated.All of this happened in the blink of an eye.Han Li's clothes only fluttered a few times. Apart from that, he was completely unscathed and wore a faint smile on his face.\"How \u2026 How is this possible?Your Excellency is a direct immortal? \"The Icy Flame Ancestor's body trembled and she spoke with disbelief.Even though this was only a projection manifested from his spiritual sense and he hadn't unleashed his full power in that attack, even a Grand Ascension Stage cultivator wouldn't be able to withstand that attack so easily, let alone a Nascent Soul cultivator.This could only mean one thing. Han Li's divine sense was not inferior to his!\"Fellow Cold Flame, can you listen to me now?\" Han Li asked faintly.\"Then why don't you tell me why you still want to steal the books that I passed down to the lower realms even though you've already achieved Immortal Karma?\"The Icy Flame Ancestor's expression changed several times. Although he was still somewhat displeased, his tone was much more relaxed.\"Because of some reasons, Han accidentally landed in this Spirit Vast Domain, and he has no ill intentions towards your esteemed sect.However, I am currently injured and I don't have any suitable pills on hand. That's why I came to your sect to get some ancient records. I want to study them. \"Han Li slowly explained.\"Oh, I see.Which part of the Immortal World does Friend Han come from? \"Even though Icy Flame Ancestor said this, his eyes flickered. He clearly didn't completely believe Han Li's words.\"Han is temporarily staying here. I won't do anything detrimental to your esteemed sect. Similarly, there's no need for you to ask about my origins.\" Han Li said with a faint smile.The Icy Flame Patriarch harrumphed coldly. An Immortal like Han Li had mysteriously appeared in the Spirit Vast Realm, so how could he not ask about his background? However, if Han Li refused to tell him, the Icy Flame Patriarch's spiritual sense avatar wouldn't be able to do anything to him.\"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. I owe you a favor this time.Han can promise that if the Leng Yan Sect is in any trouble, I can help once, \"Han Li said unhurriedly.\"Friend Han, are you serious?\" The Icy Flame Ancestor was greatly moved when he heard this.Even though he was already in the Immortal World, he naturally treasured the Leng Yan Sect that he created and carried forward with his own hands. Otherwise, he wouldn't have given him pills and cultivation methods all these years.Even though the Leng Yan Sect seemed to be powerful and glorious in the Spirit Vast Domain, it wasn't truly worry-free.However, he was in the Immortal World. Even if he wanted to help, he couldn't do much. However, if there was Han Li, who was also a True Immortal, to help, then he could do much more.\u2026 \u2026Two days later, the back mountain of the Leng Yan Sect's Sacred Fire Peak.In the depths of a purple bamboo forest shrouded in mist, there was an elegant and unique little courtyard with green tiles.The purple bamboos in the forest were scattered all over the place. They were densely packed and looked ordinary, but there was actually a secret hidden within.The position of every cluster of purple bamboos here corresponded to the base of a formation. Thousands of purple bamboos formed a sea, forming a unique formation world.The purple bamboos that were planted here were not ordinary bamboos. They were the Lung Fire Bamboo that could absorb the power of Earth Fire. If one were to look carefully at the body of the bamboo, one would be able to see that under the purple bamboo skin, there were dark red patterns that looked like flames.It was because of this Bamboo Sea Lung Fire Formation that this area became the place with the densest spirit energy and the most concentrated power of Earth Fire in the entire Spirit Flame Mountain Range.The little courtyard with green tiles and white walls was built on the eye of this formation.At this moment, in the main house of the small courtyard, a man dressed in a purple robe was sitting cross-legged on a cattail hassock, cultivating with his eyes closed.This person had long hair that was as white as snow, and a handsome face. There was a purple mark in the shape of a flame between his brows. He looked to be in his thirties, but there was a faint purple aura around his body, revealing a vigorous aura that made one's heart palpitate.On a red sandalwood table not far in front of him, there was a gold-plated purple copper incense burner, burning sandalwood incense, slowly emitting green smoke.On the wall next to the table, there was a three-foot-long painting scroll with a middle-aged man's image on it.The lines of the painting were not very detailed, but it was very vivid. The man in the painting had a square face, bright eyes, and a slight beard on his cheeks. He stood tall, his robe slightly bulging, and his body exuded a dignified aura.At this moment, the white-haired middle-aged man suddenly opened his eyes, looking at the painting scroll on the wall with a somewhat surprised expression.There was a strange fluctuation on the painting scroll, and a circle of ripple-like fluctuations rippled from it. The man in the painting seemed to come to life, his figure swayed left and right, and then he walked out of the paper.The white-haired middle-aged man hurriedly stood up, his body trembling slightly as he bowed to the ground, and said respectfully, \"Welcome, Old Ancestor.\"The man waved his hand and said, \"Get up, I descended today because I have something to tell you.\"Only then did the white-haired middle-aged man stand up, respectfully standing to the side with his hands by his side, quietly waiting for instructions.\"I already know about someone sneaking into the Scripture Pavilion a few days ago,\" the Icy Flame Ancestor said slowly.When the white-haired middle-aged man heard this, his heart tightened again, and cold sweat immediately seeped out of his forehead. Just as he was about to open his mouth to explain, he heard the Icy Flame Ancestor continue, \"This matter is dropped, there is no need to investigate further.\"\"Old Ancestor, this \u2026\" The white-haired middle-aged man was stunned, and couldn't help but hesitate.However, the Icy Flame Ancestor waved his hand to interrupt him, and his lips opened and closed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As soon as he touched the ground, he heard a man's voice from behind him.\"Brother Nangong!\"The middle-aged man turned around and saw a black-bearded Daoist wearing an azure Daoist robe walking towards him from several thousand Zhang away.The man didn't seem to be walking very quickly, but he left a trail of afterimages behind him. Every step he took covered a distance of several hundred Zhang. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived before the middle-aged man.\"Brother Zhuang, let's go together.\" The middle-aged man smiled and called out to the black-bearded Daoist.\"It has been more than ten years since we last mobilized such a large force.\"The black-bearded Daoist nodded and looked at the several streaks of light in the distance.The middle-aged man and the black-bearded Daoist were the two Peak Lords of Rising Cloud Peak and Sunset Peak, Nangong Zhangshan and Zhuang Ziyou.Nangong Zhangshan shook his head and sighed, \"It's most likely because of the theft of the Sutra Library. I'm afraid that they will be held accountable for it.\"\"Although I was busy concocting a cauldron of medicinal pills, I heard people mention that the theft was somewhat strange \u2026 The thief was able to pass through the layers of restrictions and enter the Inner Pavilion. In the end, even Elder Huyan Chang was unable to stop him.\" Zhuang Ziyou's expression was solemn.Nangong Zhangshan nodded and said, \"This matter is indeed strange. I believe that the Grand Supreme Elder will explain it in detail during the meeting.\"As they spoke, they had already passed through the plaza and arrived in front of a majestic vermillion palace. The two of them tacitly stopped talking and walked up the stairs, side by side, into the main hall.The main seat in the middle of the hall was three feet above the ground. A large carved chair was placed on top of it. There were two rows of seats on the left and right of the chair facing each other.The pillars behind the seats were inlaid with gold and carved with all kinds of rare birds and strange beasts.A red-haired burly man in a crimson red robe sat on the seat closest to the main seat. His figure was like an iron tower, and his face was gloomy like water. His entire body emitted a terrifying aura.Nangong Zhangshan and Zhuang Ziyou glanced at each other, then chose two adjacent seats and sat down, closing their eyes to rest.After waiting for a while, people began to enter the hall one after another. Soon, all the seats in the hall were filled.All of them appeared to be at the Spatial Tempering Stage, and there was not a single cultivator below the Deity Transformation Stage.But at this moment, none of them looked natural. At most, they nodded at each other as a greeting. It seemed that no one was interested in saying anything.The atmosphere in the hall was oppressive and heavy.When the entire hall was almost full, after about the time it took for half an incense stick to burn, two figures walked out from the inner hall of the hall.When everyone in the hall saw this, they immediately stood up. Even the red-haired man was no exception. They all bowed and said in unison,\"We pay our respects to the Highest Elder and the Sect Leader!\"The white-haired, handsome man in a purple robe walking in front was the only Highest Elder of the Leng Yan Sect, Sima Jingming. Accompanying him was a middle-aged man wearing a tall hat with a solemn expression. He was the Sect Leader of the Leng Yan Sect, Liu Jingzhu.Sima Jingming arrived in front of the main seat, but didn't sit down. His eyes slowly swept across everyone below.His aura wasn't revealed in the slightest, but just by standing in front of them, he gave off an oppressive feeling that made everyone tremble with fear. All of the subordinates lowered their heads, not even daring to breathe, let alone look at him.After a while, the Great Ascension Stage Highest Elder of the Leng Yan Sect slowly opened his mouth.\"A few days ago, something happened in the Heavenly Talisman Hall and the Scripture Pavilion. Today, I invited all of you here for this matter.\" His voice wasn't loud, but it was filled with an indescribable sense of majesty.Everyone's heart tightened, and they were all silent, waiting for the Highest Elder to question them.As a result, the Great Ascension Stage master said something that stunned everyone in an unquestionable tone,\"This matter ends here. Stop all the tracing and searching in the sect. There is no need to investigate further.\"Hearing this, the people in the hall couldn't believe their ears, and they couldn't help but look at each other.For a time, no one dared to ask directly.\"Senior Brother Sima, the theft of the Scripture Pavilion is of great importance, I \u2026\" The red-haired man standing in the front couldn't help but step forward and break the silence.Before he finished his words, he was interrupted by Sima Jingming coldly, \"Junior Brother Huyan, do I need to say it again?\"After that, he flicked his sleeves, turned and went straight to the inner hall, leaving the red-haired man and the peak masters in the hall who were somewhat puzzled.At this moment, the Sect Leader Liu Jingzhu also opened his mouth,\"Meeting dismissed.\"He only said these two words, and then he also flicked his sleeves and left.After a while, on the White Jade Square outside the hall.\"Stop the search?The Scripture Pavilion has lost so many precious ancient books, are we just going to let it go? \"Zhuang Ziyou seemed to have not recovered and couldn't help but ask Nangong Zhangshan.\"It doesn't matter if the ancient books are lost, there are copies in the sect, but if these secret books are leaked out, it will be very bad.The Supreme Elder naturally has his reasons for making such a decision, we should not speculate. \"Peak Master Nangong said with a smile.Although he said so, the doubts in his heart did not reduce.\u2026 \u2026It didn't take long for all the disciples of the Leng Yan Sect to discover something that puzzled them.Two important places in the sect were stolen, but the sect suddenly stopped all the tracing and searching.Although everyone was talking about it, the peak masters were all silent about it, as if they were unwilling to talk more.Therefore, such an earth-shattering event that shocked the entire sect was muddleheaded and left unsettled.As for Han Li, the initiator of all this, he was completely unaware of the series of changes that happened in the sect. He only minded his own business and hid in his cave dwelling, trying to figure out the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique.Previously, he only read it in a hurry, but now, the more he tried to figure it out, the more he felt that this technique was mysterious and unpredictable, and he was extremely excited.Speaking of which, ever since he stepped into the Taoism world, he had come across many body-refining techniques. Some of them mainly refined the muscles, some refined the bones, and some trained the internal organs, just like the Five Reserve Origin Forging Technique that he had practiced before.However, this Little Big Dipper Origin Technique was different, it cultivated the \"Mysterious Orifice\".What was the Mysterious Orifice?Han Li was baffled. The Minor Northern Stars Origin Art didn't explain it in detail, but the cultivation process described in the ancient records was incomparably profound. Even with his experience and insight, it took him a long time to comprehend it.Simply put, if this technique could be cultivated to the great success stage, the power of a punch would be enough to shatter the void, and the strength would not be inferior to an ordinary Immortal.However, correspondingly, there were also many disadvantages.First of all, the process of cultivating this technique was extremely painful, and those who were not determined enough would not be able to persist until the end.Moreover, it was extremely difficult to receive the power of the starlight. After all, the stars were far away in the depths of space and time, so it was extremely time-consuming to cultivate this technique.Han Li directly ignored this and immediately decided to start cultivating.He first went out for a while, and only returned the next day, he immediately activated all the restrictions in the cave dwelling area.In the following time, he walked around the cave dwelling, chose a suitable secret room, and even opened a big hole at the top of the room, from which he could directly see the sky.After doing all this, Han Li sat cross-legged on the ground, and quietly adjusted his breathing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne night, a few days later.There was not a trace of cloud in the sky, and a full moon hung in the middle of the starry sky. From time to time, meteors would flash by.In the secret chamber of the cave, Han Li was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed. Rays of starlight poured down through the big hole above him, making him look as if he was bathed in a faint silver light.Below him, there was a rather mysterious formation inscribed.This formation was composed of seven big star patterns, each the size of a praying mat, shining brightly, and linked together to form the shape of the Big Dipper.This formation was called the Big Dipper Energy Gathering Formation, and it was not recorded in the Little Big Dipper Energy Gathering Technique. Instead, it was derived from another star formation that he had observed at night and combined with his past attainments in formations.The power of the stars in the sky seemed similar, but in reality, they were as different as heaven and earth. Some of the power of the stars leaned towards Yin and cold, while some were extreme Yang. There were even some that alternated between Yin and Yang, and could not be lumped together. Cultivating the Little Big Dipper Origin Art required the power of the stars of the Big Dipper. The seven stars were divided into Yin and Yang, the four seasons, and the five elements.This formation had been set up by Han Li to assist him in drawing upon the power of the seven stars of the Big Dipper.He was sitting cross-legged on the first of the seven big star patterns of the formation.He suddenly opened his eyes and waved his hand to cast a spell.Buzz!The star formation below him immediately began to operate, and the seven big stars suddenly shone brightly. The first star was especially bright, and as the white light flashed, specks of white light appeared out of thin air, filling the void around it, vaguely forming a pattern of countless stars.Han Li was in this sea of stars, his figure faintly discernible, appearing somewhat hazy.He muttered something, and his fingers constantly changed, slowly operating the spell of the Little Big Dipper Energy Gathering Technique.After the time it took for a stick of incense to burn, there was a faint glimmer of light between his eyebrows, and an astonishing power of Divine Sense rolled out. After a spin, it formed an invisible whirlpool in the void above his head.He changed his two hand seals.The spiritual vortex above his head spread out and slowly changed, forming a pattern similar to a nebula. In the nebula, a Big Dipper pattern also emerged, faintly resonating with the Star Array below.Han Li raised his head and looked through the large hole in the ceiling. He looked up at the seven brightest stars in the night sky. His gaze then fell on the first Dubhe star and he chanted a cryptic incantation.Boom!The bright Dubhe Star seemed to light up slightly, and countless starlight power surged from it, like a silver waterfall falling from the sky, through the big hole, and enveloped Han Li below, the surging power of the stars surging around.Han Li's expression became extremely solemn.The power to receive the starlight depended on the strength of one's divine sense. Although his divine sense was comparable to an immortal's and he had already laid a solid foundation for practicing this technique, he could not be careless.He formed a hand seal and activated his cultivation technique.The power of the starlight in the surroundings suddenly fluctuated, and condensed together, transforming into countless sparkling light filaments. They looked like countless thin needles, and hovered slightly under the cover of his Divine Sense. Then, they fell down like raindrops, and submerged into his body.Han Li's body suddenly trembled, his eyebrows slightly wrinkled, and he took a breath of cold air.These threads of light turned out to be completely solid. They directly pierced through his skin and drilled into his body, as if thousands of swords were piercing through his body.At this moment, his whole body was densely covered with needle holes, and blood seeped out from them, quickly dyeing his body red.What was worse was that the starlight threads were running around in his body, like countless small knives twisting, and the pain was deep into his bones.If it were not for his incomparably strong body, he would probably have cried out directly.But after a moment, his eyebrows gradually relaxed, because he clearly felt that the starlight threads were gradually decomposing, turning into the purest power of the starlight, and integrating into every part of his body.Han Li was suddenly ecstatic!He took a deep breath, and quickly suppressed the joy in his heart and the pain in his body, and fully concentrated on his cultivation technique.More and more power of the starlight fell down, piercing into his body, and under the urging of his cultivation technique, it began to circulate in a certain way.His body was severely injured, and because he had not been able to replenish his Yuan Qi, he had not been able to recover. But now that he had come into contact with such pure star power, he immediately swallowed it, and his injuries rapidly healed.The small needle holes that the starlight threads had pierced into his body instantly healed, and couldn't harm his body at all.Gradually, the pain of thousands of swords piercing through his body was gradually forgotten, and he was completely immersed in his cultivation.Time flew, and in the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.In the center of the cave mansion, Han Li was still sitting cross-legged on the first big star pattern. His body was blooming with a faint brilliance, and each of his muscles and muscles began to emit starlight, and his bones also began to emit starlight.The most peculiar thing was that on his lower abdomen, a very conspicuous blue dot was blooming.The blue dot of light expanded and contracted, as if it was breathing.Most of the power of the starlight that gathered around was swallowed by this dot of light.There was no trace of pain on Han Li's face, and there was only calm and tranquil.Suddenly, there was a fluctuation of the power of the stars around him.The blue dot of light on his lower abdomen suddenly bloomed with a dazzling brilliance, rolling endlessly.The blue light suddenly flashed, and a profound star rune emerged within it.After the rune rolled for a moment, it flashed and disappeared into his body.Han Li opened his eyes, and a happy smile appeared on his face.With his powerful body and spiritual sense, in just a few days, he had successfully cultivated the first level of the Little Big Dipper Star Origin Art to perfection, and successfully condensed the first mysterious aperture.However, he still did not have the idea of going out at this moment. He still closed his eyes, and honestly sat cross-legged, intending to consolidate this cultivation technique.A few days later, on a night with a bright moon and sparse stars.In the middle of the secret room, Han Li raised his eyebrows and opened his eyes. He raised one hand and stopped the operation of the Big Dipper Star Origin Gathering Array. The power of the starry sky and the dots of white light suddenly receded like the tide.He quickly stood up, walked to the front not far away, and bent down to pick up a dark green, thin-necked bottle, and put it in front of his eyes.He saw that the whole body of the bottle was wrapped in a layer of green light at the moment, and a few strange golden runes appeared on the surface, full of ancient charm.But the next moment, the green light was submerged in the dark green patterns on the body of the bottle, but the strange golden runes remained, slightly protruding from the surface of the bottle.Lifting the small bottle and shaking it in front of his eyes, he seemed to see a drop of liquid the size of a broad bean shaking.Seeing this situation, he couldn't help but smile.These days, every time he cultivated, he would put this small bottle in the open space in front of him.Every time at a certain time, the surface of the small bottle would be covered with a layer of faint white light.If one were to look closely, they would discover that the layer of white light was formed by countless tiny white light spots. They were like living creatures that scrambled to squeeze into the small bottle until they were completely absorbed by it.But such a strange phenomenon would not last for too long, and every night after a certain time, it would immediately disappear.And every two days, after the white light on the surface of the small bottle had faded, a layer of green light would appear, and then a drop of green liquid would appear in the bottle.Han Li retracted his gaze, and his fingers gently stroked the leaf-shaped patterns on the small bottle. His movements were meticulous and gentle, as if he was caressing the cheek of his beloved.Feeling the slight protrusion from the body of the bottle, his mind couldn't help but sway a little.All of a sudden, he felt as if he had returned to the Seven Injuries Sect, back to the small medicine garden in the God Hand Valley, and back to the young man who had experimented with the green liquid in the small bottle for the first time. He was feeling a little uneasy, but also a little expectant.He knew that if he hadn't unintentionally discovered that the green liquid in the bottle could accelerate the growth of spirit herbs, perhaps he wouldn't have been able to truly embark on the path of cultivation. He also wouldn't have been able to rely on his mortal body to soar all the way to become the number one cultivator of the human race, the leader of the Spirit Realm, Han Tianzun, whom everyone worshipped.If there was one thing that had accompanied him ever since he stepped onto the path of cultivation, it was without a doubt this small bottle named 'Sovereign of the Heavens' that stood before him.Even though he had lost Daoist Xie, his Gold Devouring Beetles, and many other things that he had once relied on in the past 300 years of his coma after entering the True Immortal Realm, he had always subconsciously protected this item and never allowed it to leave his side.He had an indescribable and complicated feeling towards this small bottle.All of a sudden, Han Li raised an eyebrow, and he stopped stroking the small bottle as a peculiar expression appeared on his face.He opened the lid of the bottle and looked into it, upon which his expression became even more peculiar. He seemed to be a little surprised, but also a little elated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the cave house's alchemy room.Han Li opened the lid of the Sky Bottle and placed it on the empty space next to the cauldron. He then took a few steps back and raised his hand to activate the array under the cauldron, causing the raging flames in the cauldron to surge.After a while, he took a deep breath, stretched out a white finger, and gently hooked it in the direction of the cauldron.With a \"hu\" sound, a crimson flame immediately flew out from the bottom of the cauldron. After spinning in mid-air, it turned into a slender line of fire like a small snake. Under his control, it shot into the dark green bottle at the side.A red light flashed in the small bottle, and then the jade-like wall of the bottle was illuminated. The leaf-shaped patterns revealed a little dark red color, and they flickered as if they were alive.Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly, and he stood in the same place for a while without moving.After a while, the red light in the bottle suddenly converged and disappeared.The dark green bottle returned to normal again, as if nothing had happened.However, Han Li's gaze was focused, and he stared at the small bottle without blinking, as if he was waiting for something.Time passed little by little. After about a quarter of an hour, he raised one hand again and drew a slightly larger flame from the cauldron, causing it to enter the small bottle.Just like before, the red light in the bottle flickered again, and then it became silent again.But this time, the flickering time seemed to be a little longer than before.Seeing this, Han Li's face showed a trace of hesitation.In the following time, he continued to draw the cauldron fire into the small bottle, and the interval was getting shorter and shorter.As expected, the red light in the small bottle flickered longer and longer.After an unknown amount of time, when Han Li once again drew the cauldron fire into the small bottle, causing the red light to flicker, this time it lasted for a quarter of an hour, and there was no sign of it stopping.Han Li's eyes lit up slightly.At this moment, with a crisp sound from the bottle, the bottle began to emit traces of silver light, and it swallowed all the red light at a speed visible to the naked eye.The next moment, with a \"whoosh\" sound, a dazzling silver light shot out from the mouth of the bottle, rushing straight to the top of the secret room.\"Peng\" a muffled sound rang out.The silver light hit the ceiling of the room and fell down a little. The silver light emitted from it immediately filled the entire Alchemy Room, illuminating the whole room.Han Li raised his head and looked at the silver light above him. Blue light flashed in his eyes, and his face showed a hint of surprise and joy. But then, he frowned slightly.The ball of silver light spun a few times in the air before shrinking and transforming into a small silver firebird. It spread its wings and swooped down towards him.Han Li raised his hand, and the silver firebird nimbly stopped half a foot away from his palm. Then, it spread its wings and flew around his index finger. It constantly let out cheerful cries, as if it was very happy.This firebird was none other than the Refined Flame Firebird that was formed after the Refined Flame had a trace of spirituality!In the beginning, when he was in the human world, he cultivated the Purple Apex Fire with the Celestial Ice Flame and the cold air of the Six-winged Frost Centipede. Then, he integrated the Purple Apex Fire into the Lunar True Fire. Later, when he came to the Spiritual Realm, he swallowed a lot of other flames through the Lunar True Fire and finally formed this Refined Flame Firebird.Not only could this fire swallow all kinds of spiritual flames, but it also had a significant restraining effect on fire-attribute spirit beasts. It was one of the important helpers for him to dominate the Spiritual Realm.Han Li heaved a faint sigh as he recollected his train of thought. He raised an arm, and the Fire Raven obediently withdrew its wings before landing on his palm.For some reason, since he woke up, he had not been able to sense this fire. He originally thought that he had lost it for some reason, but he didn't expect that not only was it not lost, but it had been sleeping in his Sky Bottle.Just now, in the secret room, he had also suddenly felt a faint connection to the flame in his spiritual sense. As a result, he immediately rushed to the pill refinement room and tried to use the furnace fire as a catalyst to awaken the Fire Bird. He didn't expect it to actually succeed in one go.He looked at the silver firebird that was constantly jumping in his palm. His face looked a little gloomy under the silver light.This bird was now less than 3 inches tall, and the fire around it seemed to be a little weak. Its power was more than 10 times worse than before.This made the anger that he had been suppressing in his heart that couldn't be vented increased a little.Needless to say, this bird's current appearance was definitely related to the loss of its memory.Han Li swore in his heart that no matter who it was that had reduced him to such a state, he would make them pay for it.After a while, he calmed his mind, and his face gradually calmed down. A green light rolled out of his sleeve, and the silver firebird disappeared into his body.It was likely that this bird would need to be cultivated in his body to regain some vitality.After about 15 minutes, Han Li left the cave mansion again and came to a corner in the northwest of the spiritual field.He released his Divine Thought to sweep around. After confirming that there was nothing strange, he raised one hand and waved his wrist several times. Small triangular flags flew out one after another, circling a circular area in the field.Then he chanted a spell in a low voice and made a gesture with one hand. The circle of triangular flags suddenly flashed with a faint purple light, forming a layer of fuzzy light curtain between them, wrapping the area inside.After doing all this, he stepped into the area, and the purple light on the light curtain disappeared, completely blending into the night.At this moment, if an outsider passed by the cave mansion, as long as their cultivation hadn't reached the Soul Formation stage, they wouldn't be able to discover the abnormality here. If it was a cultivator above the Soul Formation stage, they would be discovered immediately and respond in time.Inside the light curtain, Han Li waved his hand, and more than 20 exquisite wooden boxes appeared out of thin air, floating in front of him.He casually lifted his hand, and the lids of the wooden boxes were opened one after another, from which came bursts of medicinal fragrance.Dozens of stalks of white spirit herbs with well-developed roots flew out of the medicine box one by one, falling toward the ground and taking root.These spirit herbs, which looked somewhat similar to ordinary ginseng, were the hundred year old Cloud Crane Grass.In the past few days, he had made several trips to the Valley of Ease and bought almost all the Cloud Crane Grass in the valley.In order to not attract the attention of others, he even deliberately concealed his cultivation and changed his appearance.After glancing at the white spirit herbs on the ground, Han Li took out the dark green bottle from his bosom.He took a deep breath, opened the bottle cap, and shook it lightly. Then he tilted the bottle, and poured the liquid onto the Cloud Crane Grass below.The drop of green liquid slowly slid down the mouth of the bottle, and sprinkled on the spirit herbs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpring passed and autumn came. Two years passed in the blink of an eye.The Bloodlight Mountain Range to the northwest of Toyokuni stretched for thousands of miles. The spiritual energy here was not very abundant. Desolate mountains stood in great numbers, and endless peaks and deep valleys were shrouded in mist.In a huge dark red valley in the mountain range, there were densely packed buildings built against the mountain. From time to time, a few blood-robed cultivators would fly past at a low altitude, and there were even some people hurrying in and out of these buildings.In a large hall in the depths of the valley, a middle-aged man in blue robes paced back and forth somewhat anxiously. From time to time, he would raise his head to look at a huge stone door in the depths of the hall.The stone door was tightly shut, and a blood-red fluorescence continuously flowed on it.\"Big brother still hasn't come out?\"A man's voice came from outside the hall. Following that, a strong man with a face full of scars walked in from outside.\"He should be out soon.Third brother, how are the arrangements? \"The middle-aged man in blue robes asked somewhat anxiously.\"There are already people from nine branches who have arrived. The other four should be on their way as well. The inner hall disciples who are handling matters outside have almost all been summoned back \u2026 Second brother, have we mobilized too many people?\" The scar-faced man asked somewhat hesitantly.\"In a short ten days, six branches were razed to the ground. Almost everyone, including the branch leaders, seemed to have evaporated into thin air in a single night. Not a single trace was left behind.Third brother, do you think that with our strength, we can do this? \"The middle-aged man in blue robes sighed and replied with a question.\"How is that possible?But this way, all the transactions have stopped, and we have suffered heavy losses.I'm worried that big brother will blame me for making a decision on my own, and in his anger \u2026 \"The scar-faced man laughed bitterly, but soon after, he seemed to think of something and his body trembled.\"How could I not know?But if there is even the slightest delay, I'm afraid that our strength will be greatly damaged.Don't forget that those small and medium-sized clans may normally be very respectful towards us, but in reality, all of them can't wait for our Blood Blade Association to die.When that time comes, even those from the Demon Race will definitely not miss this opportunity. \"The middle-aged man in blue robes also revealed a trace of fear on his face. He then shook his head and spoke in a low voice.\"They dare? Who doesn't know big brother's methods?To think that the head of the Yu family, the number one clan in the Lang Province, had actually dared to criticize the actions of the association. In the end, over thirteen hundred members of the clan had been turned into skeletons by the elder brother in a single night, not even mortals spared.Now that Big Brother has broken through to the mid-Deity Transformation Stage, he'll definitely be able to tear those who dared to destroy our branch into a million pieces! \"A vicious light flashed through the scarred man's eyes.\"I'm afraid this matter isn't that simple.You still don't know, right? More than a month ago, the group of Shadow Cat Clan women escorted by Hall Master Shi was robbed. More than twenty people, including Hall Master Shi, disappeared, and their whereabouts are still unknown. Now it seems that it is very likely related to the recent events.Hall Master Shi is second only to you and me in the middle stage of the Nascent Soul stage. Even his Nascent Soul couldn't escape. It's clear that he didn't come with good intentions. \"The blue-robed middle-aged man said.\"There's such a thing!It seems that the other party's strength is not inferior to Big Brother's. This time, we might have to alarm that person from the Tengui School. \"The scarred brawny man sucked in a breath of cold air.At this moment, a \"click\" sound came from the depths of the hall. The bloody light on the surface of the stone door faded, and then it opened from both sides. A white-robed man slowly walked out.This person looked to be only in his early thirties. He was handsome and had a white face without a beard. He gave people a gentle and elegant feeling.\"Welcome out of seclusion, Big Brother!\" Seeing this, the blue-robed middle-aged man and the scarred brawny man hurriedly knelt on the ground.\"Hehe, two brothers, as the vice leaders of our association, you don't need to be so polite. Stand up and talk.\" The elegant man walked slowly in front of the two and chuckled.The two of them thanked him profusely before standing up.\"Big Brother, I \u2026\" The blue-robed middle-aged man took half a step forward and wanted to say something.\"Feng Song, I already know about the message you sent to me a few days ago, otherwise, I wouldn't have come out of seclusion in advance.I don't have much time. You just need to tell me, what's the progress now? \"The elegant man interrupted the blue-robed middle-aged man's words.\"Reporting to Big Brother, three days ago, the Sui Zhou branch also encountered the same method. Almost none of the more than two hundred people survived.Combined with the previous matter of Hall Leader Shi, Third Brother and I speculated that the other party has at least the strength of Deity Transformation and is good at using fire attribute treasures or skills. \"Feng Song slightly wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and said.\"That's it?Almost no one survived. Only some people were lucky enough to survive.Feng Song, when did you learn to say Wen Jue's name? \"The elegant man looked at Feng Song and said with a fake smile.\"Big Brother, please forgive me.This person is now outside the hall. I'll get someone to bring him in. \"Feng Song's heart tightened and he quickly said.Seeing that the elegant man did not object, he hurriedly turned around and called out to the outside of the hall. At this time, the clothes on his back had already been completely soaked in cold sweat.Not long after, a thin Youth quickly walked into the hall. Seeing the three people in the hall, he quickly bent his knees and bowed.\"Greetings to the president and the two vice presidents!\"\"No need to stand on ceremony. Get up.Tell me about the situation at that time. \"The elegant man said with a gentle smile.The thin Youth didn't dare to get up and said with a stutter, \"Re \u2026 reporting to the president. Three days ago, our branch was attacked in the middle of the night. This lowly one \u2026 this lowly one couldn't see the appearance of the other party clearly. I only know that he used a fire-type divine ability and directly turned the entire branch into ashes \u2026 No one survived, not even Branch Leader Yu.\"\"Since you said that no one survived, how did you survive?\" The elegant man asked again.\"This subordinate had to go out for some business. When the incident happened, I happened to rush to the Pan Jin Mountain outside the branch, so I was lucky enough to escape,\" the thin Youth said with lingering fear.\"Did you miss anything?\" The elegant man slightly frowned.\"No \u2026 no \u2026\" Seeing this, the thin Youth became a little nervous.The elegant man smiled faintly and suddenly made a grabbing motion with one hand. The thin Youth's body tensed up and several black lights suddenly appeared on top of his head. Like snakes, they drilled into his head.The Youth let out a shrill scream as blood flowed out of his seven orifices. But soon, his voice died down and his body slumped to the ground.\"It seems that he is quite honest.\" The elegant man put down his hand and nodded, a thoughtful look flashing across his face.Feng Song and the scarred man had been bowing their heads ever since the thin Youth came in, not daring to breathe too loudly.At this moment, a loud \"boom\" suddenly came from outside, accompanied by exclamations that rose and fell in succession, causing the entire hall to rumble and shake.The elegant man's face sank. His figure suddenly turned into a bolt of lightning and flew out of the hall.Feng Song and the scarred man hurriedly followed.At this moment, the sky above the dark red valley was shrouded by a thick curtain of blood-red clouds. Above the curtain of light, there were three giant black mountains that were hundreds of feet high, surrounded by black light.The blood-red light and the black light intertwined and flickered, showing a stalemate.In the valley, countless figures flew out from various buildings. There seemed to be over a thousand people. They all looked up into the sky, their expressions changing dramatically.Boom!Another giant black mountain suddenly fell from the sky and smashed down. This time, the surface of the curtain of light violently surged with blood-red light. Then, it finally couldn't hold on any longer and shattered with a loud bang.Four giant black mountains rumbled down, shrouding a small half of the valley below in the shadow of the main hall.Everyone suddenly became a pot of porridge, and they scattered in all directions to escape.However, the mountain's momentum was astonishing. These people didn't have time to escape, and they all revealed a look of despair.At this moment, a figure appeared in the sky above the main hall out of thin air. It was the elegant man in the white robe.He raised his hand without saying a word, and a big blood-red banner appeared in front of him. It rotated and expanded against the wind. Then, a large amount of blood-red light gushed out from it, and blocked the four giant black mountains.The two collided with a loud bang!The blood-red banner shone brightly, and trembled incessantly. But, it still held the four giant mountains.\"The president is mighty!\"The people of the Bloody Saber Association cheered under the shadow.However, they didn't have time to cheer for the second time. A black shadow flashed higher in the sky, and another giant mountain came crashing down with a loud bang.Whoosh!The blood-red light dispersed under the pressure of the five giant mountains. The blood-red banner was also torn apart, and the five giant black mountains came crashing down at an astonishing speed.The five giant mountains almost occupied the entire sky above the valley, and the valley was shrouded in darkness.The elegant man's expression changed, and he didn't hesitate. His body swayed, and he flew out of the valley before the five mountains hit the ground.Rumble!The five mountains hit the ground with a loud bang, and a vast cloud of dust rose. The ground shook violently, and mournful screams rose and fell. But, they were immediately drowned out by the loud rumbling.A figure blurred above the valley, and the elegant man's figure appeared. He looked at a place not far away from him with an ashen face.A green jade flying boat was floating there, and an old man and a young girl were standing on it. The old man was an old man dressed in a greyish-white Daoist robe, and the young girl had a pair of quick-witted eyes. She was a beautiful young girl.They were Daoist Baishi and Liu Le'er.The elegant man narrowed his eyes, and slowly asked, \"Who are the two of you?\"\"The people who have come to kill you!\" Liu Le'er's voice was cold.\"Huh? You're from the Cloud Fox Clan?I know. You must be the small demon fox that escaped from me all those years ago.I didn't think that you would reach Core Formation stage after so many years.Speaking of which, the fur of the Azure Cloud Hill's Cloud Fox Clan is a superior defensive magic treasure material. In the past, it really made me a great profit. \"The scholarly man let out a cry of surprise, then chuckled as if he had thought of something.\"Jia Ren, I'll kill you!\"Liu Le'er's eyes reddened, and her slender fingers began to move like a wheel. Silver light flashed from her left arm, and a silver fireball flew out. It revolved in the air, and transformed into a palm-sized silver firebird before pouncing toward the elegant man.As Jia Ren spoke, he had already released his spiritual sense. He instantly swept through an area of several hundred kilometers, but he didn't find any cultivators at or above Deity Transformation stage.When he saw the unremarkable silver firebird, he was slightly startled. Soon, a sneer appeared on his face.\"Two Core Formation Stage juniors dare to challenge me? What a joke!\"With that said, he opened his mouth and spat out a black ring. The ring revolved in the air, and suddenly transformed into a black flaming beast that was over three hundred meters tall.The beast resembled a lion or a tiger, and it exuded an extremely violent aura. It stomped its four feet in the air, and it charged toward the silver firebird.The difference in size between the two was like the difference between heaven and earth.As a result, silver light flashed, and the silver firebird instantly disappeared into the black flaming beast's body.The black flaming beast's body stiffened, and with a loud boom, it exploded.Jia Ren's eyes widened, and he didn't dare to believe what he was seeing. However, he immediately reacted, and he immediately fled. Light flashed from his body, and a suit of shimmering crimson armor suddenly appeared over his body.However, the silver firebird was extremely fast, and it almost instantly caught up to him. In a flash, it pierced through his body, and the crimson armor wasn't able to block it in the slightest.\"No \u2026\"Jia Ren only had time to shout the word \"No\" before his body turned into a ball of flames. Everything, including the magic treasures on his body, was quickly reduced to ashes.The silver firebird circled in the air, and it opened its mouth again, spitting out a wave of silver flames toward the valley below.As it descended, the silver flames rapidly expanded, turning into a sea of silver flames that enveloped the entire dark red valley.With the five mountains suppressing them, it was impossible for the people in the valley to escape in a short period of time.At this moment, Liu Le 'er looked down at the raging sea of flames, and her vision was blurred by her tears.She muttered to herself, \"Father, mother, big brother, big sister \u2026 Le 'er has finally killed my enemies today. I've exterminated the Blood Saber Gang, and I've avenged you.\"After a long while, Daoist White Stone cupped his hands and said, \"Fellow Daoist Liu, congratulations on your revenge!\"\"This is all thanks to everything Fellow Daoist White Stone has done over the years. Big brother said he would remember it.\" Liu Le 'er wiped away her tears and curtsied to Daoist White Stone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt the same time.Spirit Flame Mountain Range, Chuyun Peak.In a secluded secret room of a cave house, the light was as bright as day.A huge white cocoon in the shape of a human stood in the center of the secret chamber. Its surface was covered in fine white threads of light that were connected to one another, layer after layer. There were no less than a hundred layers of this cocoon.Suddenly, the formation below shone brightly, especially the nebula pattern below the white cocoon. It burst into a dazzling light that filled the room.The bright threads of light on the surface of the white cocoon suddenly squirmed as if they were alive. Then, countless white runes suddenly appeared on the surface and expanded at an incredible speed.After the cocoon expanded and shrank, it burst open.Following an earth-shattering boom, a bare-chested young man suddenly emerged from the center of the secret chamber with his eyes closed.He was tall and had an ordinary appearance. His whole body was wrapped in white gas.It was Han Li.He suddenly opened his eyes. Blue light flashed in his eyes and an amazing aura burst out from his body, rushing away the white gas that wrapped his body.On his chest and abdomen, there were five dazzling blue light spots. Each of them had a strange star rune, spinning and flickering.Under his skin, there was also a faint light flowing in his muscles and bones. The starlight flashed as if there were thousands of stars hidden in it.After a while, as the star runes gradually faded, the light spots also disappeared.Han Li opened his eyes and let out a long breath. He couldn't help but feel a little excited.After two years of hard work, he had finally successfully condensed the fifth mysterious aperture and reached the fifth realm of the Little Big Dipper Yuan Gong.This cultivation speed was more than a hundred times faster than what was described in the cultivation method!What made him most excited was that his physical injuries had finally been completely healed at this moment. His Divine Soul had also recovered to about one-third of its peak.As he thought so, he flipped his palm and a light blue spirit grass that looked like ginseng appeared in his palm. He put it in his mouth and chewed it.Feeling the spiritual power in his dantian gradually filling, Han Li couldn't help but smile bitterly.Over the past two years, he had accumulated quite a lot of Cloudcrane Grasses of five or six hundred years like the one in front of him for cultivation purposes through the green liquid.The reason for this was because it was already enough for him. Anything more than that would just be a waste.Not long ago, he even directly ripened a ten thousand year old plant and consumed it. As a result, after the medicinal power exceeded the Nascent Soul Stage, it still dissipated on its own. It did not help in recovering his cultivation at all.Han Li shook his head and calmed his mind. He closed his eyes and casually looked inside his body, only to find that the thick mist shrouding his Dantian was obviously much thinner.He was overjoyed and quickly cast his Divine Sense toward the golden light emitted by the Nascent Soul. He saw that the golden little person was still in its original position, sleeping soundly.Seeing this situation, Han Li pondered for a while, then he channeled the power of his Divine Thought, causing the spiritual power contained in his dantian to surge. Slender crystal threads appeared out of thin air, flying up and down toward the nascent soul.When approaching the nascent soul, all the crystal threads suddenly accelerated, stabbing straight at it like a steel needle.At this moment, there was a loud \"boom\", and an arc-shaped black light swept out from the nascent soul, immediately blocking all the crystal threads.Han Li's body shook violently, and he only felt a violent shock in his dantian.His expression changed a few times. After gritting his teeth, he suddenly channeled the Cultivating Spirit Technique.\"Boom!\" The power of his spiritual sense spread throughout his dantian, and the number of thin translucent threads abruptly increased drastically, transforming into a vast expanse of translucent waves that crashed viciously into the arc-shaped black light with unstoppable force.\"Poof\"!The arc-shaped black light only flashed a few times, and finally couldn't withstand it anymore, turning into a black smoke and dissipating.The crystal tide suddenly submerged the golden little person, and Han Li's Divine Sense finally penetrated into the nascent soul's body as he wished.As a result, the next moment, his face became abnormally ugly.The nascent soul's body was crisscrossed, and there were eight pitch-black chains shining with a gloomy light!These chains almost ran through the entire nascent soul, some connected to the nascent soul's limbs, and some went straight to the nascent soul's head. There was a faint black mist lingering on it, looking extremely strange.What was even more shocking was that on these black chains, there seemed to be some kind of unknown power of law.Han Li frowned slightly, and he channeled his mind to control the crystal threads to condense into a crystal clear small axe, chopping straight at a black chain.\"Clang\".The small axe blade chopped on the chain, and it suddenly shook, then it was pushed back by a strange force, flying upside down, collapsing into crystal light spots in the air, disappearing.Han Li's mind was slightly shocked, and he stopped for a moment, then he channeled his technique again.Under the command of his Divine Sense, a large amount of spiritual power turned into a green smoke, condensing and floating toward the black chain. It attached to it like a thick mist, trying to melt it.However, the moment the green smoke came into contact with the chains, the chains immediately began to shake rapidly. Wisps of black mist suddenly increased, and very quickly, they wrapped around the green smoke and engulfed it.Seeing this, Han Li still didn't want to give up, and his gestures changed again \u2026At the same time, somewhere in the Celestial World.In a vast and boundless desert, the sky was gloomy and gloomy, and the air was suffused with a pungent and suffocating smell of dust. Violent winds howled in the surroundings like the wailing of thousands of ghosts, and the layers of sand that were raised up covered the entire horizon.In the sky, dozens of yellow sand dragons rolled forward like a yellow high wall that connected the sky and the earth. It rolled forward, getting wider and wider, and the momentum was getting bigger and bigger.However, when it rolled to about ten miles away from the center of the desert, it clearly did not encounter any obstacles, but it suddenly collapsed with a loud bang as if it had hit a towering mountain, turning into dust that scattered in all directions.In the center of the desert, there was a majestic hall that was more than a hundred feet high. The hall was completely yellow, and there were no carvings on the exterior. It looked like it was made of yellow sand, exuding a desolate and unsophisticated breath.The interior of the hall was rather spacious, and there were dozens of thick square pillars scattered everywhere. Dozens of braziers hung on the walls on both sides of the hall, emitting a gloomy green glow, causing the entire hall to appear even more gloomy and gloomy, and outlining a lonely pitch-black wide chair in the depths of the hall.What was strange was that the wind was whistling outside, but the hall was extremely quiet. There was almost no sound.\"Clang clang\"There was a skinny middle-aged man sitting on the pitch-black chair. He was slightly raising his withered palm, causing the greenish-black chain that was wrapped around his arm to emit a sound of metal rubbing against metal.This man's cheeks were sunken, and his face was withered. His half-closed mouth revealed a row of dense white teeth. He was wearing a snow-white cloak, and the skin that was exposed on his body was purple and black. He looked exactly like a green-faced, ferocious-fanged zombie.Upon closer inspection, the white cloak on his body was wrapped densely with greenish-black chains that were as thick as an arm. The ends of the chains extended in all directions, and almost covered the entire hall.At this time, the zombie-like man's tightly closed eyes suddenly opened, and a strange expression appeared on his greenish-black, withered face.\"Guards!\"The zombie-like man shouted in a low voice. His voice was hoarse and deep, as if his throat was also filled with sand.The iron chains on the ground not far from him suddenly shook, and an earthy yellow lump slowly bulged up from below. Then, it distorted and blurred, and unexpectedly transformed into a tall and sturdy man wearing ancient bronze armor.The man's complexion was dark green, and it seemed as if there was a layer of copper rust on his face. He knelt on the ground and respectfully said,\"Ancestor!\"\"In the past thousand years, among my disciples, who has used the Primordial Isolation Chain that I have personally bestowed upon them?\" The zombie-like man's voice was hoarse as he asked directly.\"Ancestor, three hundred years ago, Lord Fang Pan, who was serving in the Immortal Palace, encountered a strong enemy. He once used the Primordial Isolation Chain to kill his opponent. After that, no one else has used it,\" the copper-armored man immediately replied.When the zombie-like man heard this, he softly muttered to himself, \"So it was Old Seven \u2026\"After thinking for a moment, he opened his mouth and said to the copper-armored man, \"Send a message to Fang Pan. Tell him that the enemy that he used the Primordial Isolation Chain to kill didn't die. Now, he has once again activated the power of law contained in the Primordial Isolation Chain.\"\"Yes, Ancestor,\" the copper-armored man replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInside the cave house.Han Li slowly opened his eyes and withdrew his Divine Sense from his body. There was a trace of exhaustion on his face.After he calmed down, he took out a piece of light blue cloud crane grass and put it into his mouth to chew. There was a look of contemplation on his face.After a while, he let out a long breath and suddenly said:\"Daoist Magic Light, can you come out for a chat?\"After his voice fell, the shadow in front of him twisted and elongated. A man in a black robe with dark skin and a similar appearance to him with long hair stood up.The man looked at Han Li and was silent.\"Magic Light, have you ever seen a mystic art that can seal someone's nascent soul with a chain that contains some kind of law?\" Han Li asked directly.\"Daoist's nascent soul being sealed is related to this?\"After two years of recuperation, Magic Light had also recovered a lot, but he still looked a bit mechanical when he spoke.Han Li nodded and roughly told the other party about the current situation of the nascent soul in his body.\"According to my judgment, in this case, I'm afraid that you must first restore your spiritual power and cultivation level before you can rely on a mystic art to make your nascent soul break free on its own.But on the other hand, your nascent soul is now because of the shackles of these law chains, it can't cultivate at all, let alone restore your cultivation level.As a result, it has formed a self-contradictory dead knot. \"Magic Light said after a moment of silence.\"I have roughly deduced what you said, and the situation is even worse than what you said.Even if I self-destruct my body now and my nascent soul takes over another body, I can't get rid of this technique. \"Han Li frowned and said.\"Daoist just went to the Scripture Pavilion of this sect not long ago, did you find anything?\" Magic Light asked again.\"Although I read a lot of ancient books, they were almost useless.\" Han Li sighed helplessly.\"In this case, I don't think the level of mystic arts in this world is enough to solve this problem.I'm afraid I can only find a way to solve this problem by returning to the Celestial Realm. \"Magic Light replied after a moment of silence.\u2026Somewhere in the Immortal World, in an unknown dense forest.The forest was shrouded in clouds and mist, and there were ancient trees that towered into the sky that were over three hundred meters tall. Some of them were verdant and exuberant, some were withered and decayed, and there were even some that were completely purplish red. It was extremely strange.In the depths of the dense forest was an open area that was around 3km wide. There were practically no tall trees there, and only expanses of short shrubs grew there. Compared to the surrounding environment, it seemed to be slightly out of place.In the center of this area, there was a strange ancient tree that towered into the clouds.The tree was greenish-black in color and had a diameter of at least three hundred meters. Its trunk was perfectly straight, with few branches and not a single leaf growing on it. It looked like a giant pillar that supported the sky.What was even more special was that there was a huge gray bird's nest on seven or eight slanted branches somewhere above the ancient tree. From afar, it looked like an upside-down, worn-out straw hat.An unbelievably large and strange giant bird was lying in the giant nest, whimpering in a low voice. It seemed to be in great pain.The bird's body was covered with arrow-like feathers. Its head was unusually large, but its neck was somewhat slender. There was also a giant pouch hanging near its chest that bulged and shrank as it breathed.Suddenly, the bird's neck suddenly straightened, and its head was raised high. Its eyes were full of vigilance as it looked at a certain place. The frequency of the pouch on its chest expanding and contracting greatly increased.There was a sound of breaking through the air!In three directions at the edge of the area, the forest shook violently at the same time. A figure jumped up from each direction, and then shot straight toward the giant nest.These three people were all dressed in black, and the timing of their leaps was exactly the same. Even the range of their movements was exactly the same. What was even more surprising was that these three people's figures and appearances were exactly the same. They were all handsome men with sharp eyes and Youth faces.The three of them quickly closed the distance between them and the giant nest at an indescribable speed, leaving a trail of afterimages in midair, but then their figures blurred and disappeared at the same time.\"Chirp!\"The strange bird was startled, and the pouch on its chest bulged. It suddenly opened its mouth toward the southeast, and let out a deafening cry.The rolling sound waves, with an incomparably violent momentum, wrapped in countless densely packed green wind blades, swept toward the direction of the tall trees in front of it.\"Rumble!\"Like the rolling of thunder, the countless wind blades formed an arc-shaped high wall. Everywhere it passed, the low shrubs were uprooted and twisted into fragments. The tall trees were all broken and cut into pieces.Under the cover of the smoke and dust, these fragments became a part of this torrent, and continued to crazily rush toward the dense forest with an undiminished momentum.In the void in the southeast direction, the two black figures that had just disappeared suddenly flashed out of the smoke and dust, and rapidly descended toward the ground.At the same time, the two of them suddenly flashed with green light, and their figures immediately became blurred. Their speed was unreasonably fast, and sometimes slow, and they constantly flashed in the air.The wind blades that blotted out the sky and covered the earth were actually unable to touch him at all.The giant bird's head roared continuously, and dense wind blades swept in all directions under the cover of the sound waves.The two figures shuttled through the wind blades as if they were strolling in a courtyard. Their figures flickered, and they were unexpectedly not affected by the sound waves at all.Seeing that the two people were getting closer and closer, the giant bird looked down at its lower body, and let out a long mournful cry.The flesh pouch under its neck swelled rapidly, and in a moment, it had become as big as its body, and it was still growing.Seeing this, a black-clothed Youth suddenly became furious.\"Evil creature, you still want to self-destruct?Dream on! \"As soon as the voice fell, the third black-clothed Youth, who had been hidden before, suddenly appeared in the void in front of the giant bird's head without warning.He held a dark long knife in his hand, and with a slight shake of his wrist, a black light flashed, and instantly slashed the giant bird's throat.There was a loud \"puff puff\" sound, and a strong force gushed out from the wound, carrying a large amount of blue blood, like a fountain, sprayed more than ten feet high.When the blue blood fountain gushed out, the flesh pouch under the cyan giant bird's neck also shrunk to its original state. Its head was tilted in the giant nest, and its feathers were stained with blood.Under its body, there was a white giant egg stained with blue blood, leaning against the giant bird's abdomen, looking very lonely.The three black-clothed young men jumped down from the giant bird's head expressionlessly. They walked to its wings and tail respectively. After rummaging through the thick feathers for a while, they each pulled out a feather that was flickering with light.At this moment, a yellow light suddenly lit up at the waist of one of them, accompanied by a rapid buzzing sound.When the other two saw this, they immediately swayed and came to the side of the black-clothed Youth. The three figures blurred, and they actually merged into one.Immediately afterward, the black-clothed Youth took out a circular communication disc from his waist. He scanned it with his Divine Sense, and his face suddenly changed. He frowned and shouted,\"This is impossible \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the secret chamber.Han Li looked at Magic Light, who was gradually disappearing into his shadow. He laughed bitterly in his heart and stopped thinking about the sealing of his Nascent Soul.He raised his head and looked at the starry night sky through the large hole above him.After a while, he stood up and walked to the sixth star of the Big Dipper Essence Congregation Formation, the Mizar Star. He sat down cross-legged again and formed a hand seal with both hands. After a few hand seals, the entire formation was instantly activated.After adjusting his breathing, Han Li slowly closed his eyes and stopped moving.In the end, an hour later, when he started to activate the chant for the sixth level of the Little Big Dipper Essence Skill, something unexpected happened.For some reason, the power of the stars that was drawn down from the sky this time was several times more than before. In a few breaths, it formed six incomparably thick pillars of starlight.From afar, it seemed as if there were six blurry pillars of light descending from the night sky above the cave abode. The surging power of starlight spread from them, and they looked extraordinary.Seeing this, Han Li was shocked.When he'd cultivated the first five levels earlier, even though he'd caused some phenomenon, it was far from being as magnificent as it was now, so he didn't think too much about it. After all, there were many cultivation techniques in the Spirit Circle that required the assistance of the stars to cultivate, so it was normal to cause some phenomena of the heavens and the earth while cultivating.However, with such a shocking phenomenon today, it would not be easy to not attract attention.He shook his head and did not pay too much attention to it. He continued to cultivate quietly.\u2026In the sky above a certain cave abode, a burly man stood in the air. He looked at the six huge pillars of light descending from the sky and revealed a surprised and serious expression.In the next moment, black light flowed on his body and he turned into a blurry shadow that shot out. Very quickly, he landed near Han Li's cave abode without a sound.The closer he got, the more he could feel the overwhelming power of the starlight contained in the pillars of light. It was like waves of the sea that spread towards the surroundings.After a moment of hesitation, he decided to take the risk and cast a spell to investigate.\"Luo Jun, wait.\" A voice suddenly sounded beside Luo Jun's ear without warning.Then, he felt his vision blur and the figure of a man in a scholar's robe appeared in front of him out of nowhere.It was the peak master of Chuyun Peak, Nangong Zhangshan.\"Peak Lord.\"Luo Jun was slightly startled, then the black light around his body slightly fluctuated, and his figure slowly appeared. He still wanted to say something.But Nangong Zhangshan waved his hand and interrupted him.\"You don't have to say anything. Follow me.\"Then he didn't wait for Luo Jun to reply. His body glowed brightly, and he flew toward the top of the mountain.Luo Jun opened his mouth, seemingly wanting to say something. However, seeing that Nangong Zhangshan was already far away, he could only transform into a beam of black light and follow.A moment later, in the main hall at the summit.As soon as Luo Jun landed on the ground, he saw Nangong Zhangshan was walking toward the depths of the main hall with his hands clasped behind his back.\"Peak Lord, the phenomenon that Han Li is causing most likely indicates that he's cultivating an extraordinary cultivation art.After all, this person's origins are somewhat suspicious. If we don't investigate clearly and the sect investigates, how are we going to explain ourselves? \"\"It's the First Supreme Elder's voice transmission. He told us to stay out of this matter.\" Peak Master Nangong said without stopping.\"Great Elder!Why is he \u2026 \"Luo Jun was startled and revealed an expression of shock, but then he asked with some doubt.Peak Master Nangong suddenly stopped and turned around. \"The First Supreme Elder has his reasons for doing things. We will just follow his orders.\"\"Since it's the First Supreme Elder's orders, I understand.\" Luo Jun heard this and nodded.\"Also, pass down the order. No one is allowed to approach Han Li's cave, and no one is allowed to disturb him!\" Peak Master Nangong immediately ordered.\"Yes!\" Luo Jun accepted the order and walked out of the main hall.\"Han Li \u2026 Just who are you to be able to make the First Supreme Elder, who is in seclusion all year round, pay attention to you \u2026\" Peak Master Nangong muttered to himself and gradually fell into deep thought.\u2026 \u2026The phenomenon caused by Han Li's cave didn't last for long. About an hour later, the six pillars of starlight dissipated and disappeared.However, no one from the entire sect came to the scene despite such a huge commotion, as if no one noticed it.Inside the cave, Han Li was still sitting with his legs crossed. His eyes were already open, but he didn't move for a long time. His expression was slightly heavy.The sixth level of the Lesser Northern Stars Technique was far more difficult than he had imagined. Needless to say, it was much more obscure than the fifth level. Most importantly, the demand for the power of starlight had increased by several times.With his current Divine Sense, it was actually enough to handle it.However, the more he used the power of his Divine Sense, the greater the consumption of his magic power. Previously, he could use the Cloud Crane Grass to support his cultivation, but now, even if he used the little green bottle to continuously mature the Spirit Grass, he still couldn't guarantee that he could continue to cultivate.At this rate, it would take at least ten years to reach the sixth level.Thinking of this, Han Li couldn't help but frown.He had to return to the Celestial Realm as soon as possible. Ten years was too long, he couldn't wait.Truth be told, if he was able to cultivate the sixth level of the Minor Big Dipper Origin Art within ten years, this speed was already extremely shocking. If the Icy Flame Ancestor in the Immortal World knew about this, he would probably be so shocked that his jaw would drop.Han Li touched his chin, but his expression changed as he suddenly thought of something.Then, he closed his eyes and recalled the information he had found in the books.After a moment, he raised his eyebrows and opened his eyes, revealing a faint smile.The Leng Yan Sect was indeed one of the three major sects in the Spirit Huan Realm. He really found two methods from the information he had obtained from the Scripture Pavilion.One was related to the other major sect that was on par with the Leng Yan Sect, the Realm Daoist Temple.Among the many inheritances of the Realm Daoist Temple, there were many techniques that relied on the power of stars to cultivate. It was said that the founder of the Realm Daoist Temple was proficient in star techniques.Inside the temple, there was a \"Star Gathering Platform\" that used countless rare materials. On it was inscribed a Star Gathering Formation from ancient times.This formation was personally set up by the founder of the Realm Daoist Temple. It was far from comparable to the Big Dipper Gathering Formation that Han Li had figured out and set up himself.With the help of this formation, it was said that it could easily draw in the power of stars four to five times more than usual. It was famous in the entire Spirit Huan Realm.However, the Realm Daoist Temple attached great importance to this treasure platform. Even in the sect, only the most core disciples and elders could use it. Outsiders couldn't even see it.As for the other method, it was a certain jade slip that recorded the method to refine a special magic treasure. This treasure was called the \"Star Moon Treasure Mirror\".The Star Moon Treasure Mirror was not a powerful offensive spirit treasure. It was only a supportive magic treasure. It only needed a small amount of magic power to activate, and this treasure mirror could draw in a large amount of the power of stars.The method to refine this treasure mirror was obtained by a Body Integration Elder of the Leng Yan Sect by chance in a secret realm tens of thousands of years ago.Because there were not many star techniques in the sect, and refining this treasure required an extremely large amount of precious materials, almost ten times more than normal magic treasures, so even though this jade slip was precious, no one had ever asked about it.The most important thing was that the main spirit material to refine this treasure was a special material called \"Yin Chen Stone\". This ore was extremely rare, and it was something that the Tengui School regarded as the foundation.It was said that when cultivating the last few layers of the \"Great Heavenly Ghost Technique\", the Tengui School's signature technique, a large amount of Yin Chen Stone would be consumed.As for the few known Yin Chen Stone mines in the Spirit Huan Realm, they were all in the hands of the Tengui School.It could be said that whether it was the Star Gathering Platform or the Star Moon Treasure Mirror, it was not easy to obtain them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was still late at night, and everything was quiet.Han Li emerged from the cave abode and flew toward a certain direction as a streak of light.Not long after he flew out, he only felt that the sky in front of him darkened. A giant white palm appeared out of thin air and fell down.\"Chi chi\", countless white fire lotuses appeared out of thin air. They spun and shot out countless lotus petals, covering an area of more than a thousand meters. Han Li couldn't dodge at all.The temperature of the nearby air suddenly dropped under the extreme cold breath. Even the ground of the nearby mountain top was covered with a layer of crystal clear frost.Han Li was slightly startled, then he raised his hand and punched in the air. Suddenly, an invisible force surged out.\"Bang bang bang!\" A series of chaotic sounds!Almost all the white fire lotuses collapsed like bubbles, turning into crystal lights that dissipated in the sky.The spiritual light on the surface of the giant white palm tremored violently in the face of this enormous force, and the nearby space warped slightly as a series of rumbling booms rang out.The owner of the giant palm seemed to be a little caught off guard. He shrank in panic and disappeared into the void.Then the void not far away fluctuated, and a figure covered in a layer of white light emerged. The figure was holding a crystal clear blue jade ruler in his hand. The surface of the ruler was engraved with circles of mysterious patterns that looked like whorls.As soon as the figure appeared, he flipped his hand and threw the jade ruler into the sky.The ruler spun and grew to more than a thousand meters in size. The spirit patterns on the surface lit up in a series, blooming a dazzling blue brilliance.The white figure raised one hand.There was a loud whistling sound!Immediately, the giant ruler let out a long sound, and it struck down at Han Li with the sound of wind and thunder.Han Li's eyes flashed slightly. He moved his sleeve and stretched out his hand, grabbing in the air.Before he really grabbed it, a huge force that could condense the air surged toward the giant ruler. The spiritual light on the surface of the ruler trembled violently. It spun in the air and couldn't fall down.At this moment, the spirit patterns on the surface of the giant ruler shone brightly, and a phantom of a monster with a bull's head and a dragon's body appeared vaguely. It opened its mouth and let out a strange roar that sounded like a bull's roar.The giant blue ruler buzzed and trembled, and was about to descend again.Han Li narrowed his eyes and activated the Little Big Dipper Origin Art. Immediately, five dots of blue light flashed from his chest and abdomen, faintly forming the image of the Big Dipper. However, only five of the stars shone brightly, while the other two were dim and dull.The five fingers that he stretched out suddenly came together, and the nearby void suddenly twisted and swayed!The strange dragon shadow on the surface of the huge blue ruler let out a miserable wail, and dispersed with a 'bang'.\"Friend Han, I'm Sima Jingming. Please show mercy!\" The white figure hurriedly said.As soon as he finished speaking, the white light around him disappeared, revealing a man in a purple robe with a head full of white hair.Han Li's eyes flashed, and he stopped clenching his fist.Sima Jingming made a lightning-fast hand seal, and the giant blue ruler shrunk to a hundred times its original size. In a flash, it returned to his hand.He let out a sigh of relief.Just now, through the spirit treasure in his hand, he could clearly feel how terrifying the other party's grasp was. If he had hesitated for even a moment, he feared that the treasure would have lost a great deal of its spirituality.Although he hadn't used his full strength, it was obvious that the other party had been merciful when he saw how casually the other party had dealt with his attack.\"What is the meaning of this, Fellow Sima?\" Han Li expressionlessly asked with his hands behind his back.\"Friend Han, please don't mind me. I didn't mean to offend you. I only wanted to test your true strength.After all, the agreement between you and the Old Ancestor is an extremely important matter to our sect. I have to see what the sect's one million years of savings can be exchanged for. \"Sima Jingming flipped his hand and put away the jade ruler.\"How do you feel now, Fellow Daoist?\" Han Li raised an eyebrow with a hint of a smile on his face.\"Brother Han's strength is far stronger than I expected. Being able to cultivate the Little Big Dipper Origin Art to such a level in such a short period of time is truly an eye-opener for me.Our sect has also cultivated this cultivation method in the past, but unfortunately, they were only at the beginner level. \"Sima Jingming sighed and sincerely praised.\"You're far too kind, Fellow Daoist Sima,\" Han Li replied with a smile.He paused for a moment and continued, \"As for the lost records in your sect's Scripture Pavilion, after Han is done with his business, I can make a copy of them.\"\"Friend Han is too polite. Our sect has a copy of the missing records.However, I hope you won't forget your promise to the ancestor. \"Sima Jingming said and cupped his hands at Han Li.\"Han naturally won't go back on his word.\" Han Li calmly said.\"Good, I'm relieved to hear that.Brother Han seems to have something to do. I won't disturb you anymore. \"Sima Jingming cupped his hands at Han Li again.Han Li didn't say anything else. His body was wrapped in a green light and he flew away. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.\u2026Celestial Realm, Northern Frost Celestial Realm.A green mountain that was more than a thousand feet tall was shrouded in dense spirit energy. At the peak of the mountain, there was a magnificent golden palace that was shining brightly under the sun.At this moment, an old man with a long beard wearing a purple-gold robe and a lotus crown was sitting on a large red sandalwood chair in the main hall. He was holding a crystal clear jade teacup in his hand. After taking a sip slowly, he raised his head and looked at the person in front of him.The person looked to be in his twenties or thirties. He wore black clothes and bowed respectfully to the old man. He said, \"Immortal Elder Tong Xu, this junior is Fang Pan. Today, I came to ask Immortal Elder Tong Xu to help me find someone.\"The old man put the teacup on the side table and said, \"I am not interested in who you are. However, you should know the rules of the Tong Xu Pavilion, right?\"The Youth in black immediately took half a step forward and said, \"A ten thousand year Void Sea Purple Yang Flower, two high grade Golden Eyed Dragon's Eye Stones, and a bottle of Boyang Yin Water. Is Immortal Elder satisfied?\"After he finished speaking, two exquisite purple boxes and a white jade bottle appeared in the void in front of him. The lid of the box and the bottle were opened by themselves, revealing the contents inside.The old man glanced at them and his eyes lit up. He nodded slightly and said, \"You have some sincerity.Tell me, who are you looking for? \"The Youth in black furrowed his brows and said, \"This person is a formidable enemy that I met in the past. I thought that he had died in my hands three hundred years ago. Recently, I found out that he might still be alive. However, I don't know where he is now. I hope Immortal Elder can help me find him.\"\"Is there anything related to his bloodline, hair, scales, or anything like that?\" The old man asked.The Youth in black hesitated for a moment. He turned his wrist and took out a white porcelain bottle. He handed it over and said, \"This person's bloodline is a little special.When I fought with him, I managed to obtain a drop of blood essence. Immortal Elder, please take a look and see if it is suitable. \"The old man took the porcelain bottle and shook it. He felt that it was quite heavy. He opened the bottle cap and sniffed it. His expression changed immediately.\"Strange, strange. Who is this person?His bloodline contains so many kinds of spiritual force? \"Immortal Elder Tong Xu exclaimed in surprise.\"This \u2026 I won't hide it from Immortal Elder. This person is someone who ascended from the Lower Realm. He has a variety of magical abilities and is not weak. I was lucky to defeat him in the past.\" The Youth in black hesitated for a moment before replying.\"Someone who ascended from the Lower Realm \u2026 Forget it. Come with me.\"Immortal Elder Tong Xu pondered for a moment. He stood up and walked toward the back of the hall with one hand behind his back.The Youth in black followed him around a beautiful golden lacquer screen in the hall. They passed through the back of the hall and arrived at a secret room.The secret room was very spacious. The floor was engraved with three layers of circular patterns. It was obvious that they were some kind of extremely complicated array patterns.There were no tables or chairs in the room. There was only a large bronze urn in the center.The urn was about three feet tall. It was also engraved with simple and strange patterns. They were closely connected with the patterns on the floor.The Youth in black followed Immortal Elder Tong Xu to the large urn. He looked down and saw that the urn was filled with a black liquid. The liquid's surface vaguely reflected their figures.The old man opened the lid of the porcelain bottle in his hand. With a flip of his wrist, he poured the drop of blood essence inside the urn.\"Ding Dong\"A drop of pale golden blood slipped from the bottle and fell into the urn. It made a soft sound and splashed rings of ripples that spread to the surroundings.Then, Fang Pan saw that the black liquid in the urn immediately dissipated along with the ripples. In the blink of an eye, the urn became clear.Through the liquid, he could see that the bottom of the urn was also engraved with circular patterns.When Immortal Elder Tong Xu saw this, his lips moved and he immediately chanted an obscure incantation.\"Open\"After a long while, he shouted and poked at the space between his eyebrows with one hand. Then, he pointed at the bronze urn.\"Buzz \u2026\" A muffled sound was heard.When the bronze urn touched the edge of the urn, it suddenly shook. The engraved patterns on the urn suddenly emitted a strong green light.Then, the light spread down along the runes and quickly lit up the entire formation on the ground.Before Fang Pan could react, he was shrouded in a green light.He suddenly realized that he was standing on a vast body of water. When he looked around, he saw that he was surrounded by green mountains.\"This is \u2026 a jar!\" After looking for a moment, the black-clothed young man muttered to himself in sudden realization.\u2026Recommended Huan Yu's new work, \"The Way of Cooking\"While others were worrying about losing weight, Song Hao had no choice but to eat a ton of food every day because of his cultivation.While others were controlling their diet and did not dare to eat sweets, Song Hao never had to worry about his three high blood sugar levels. He was not afraid of fat, but he loved sweets the most \u2026Whether it was junk food or delicacies, Song Hao did not reject them. He ate as much as he could.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Don't look left and right, you only have five breaths of time!\"At that moment, Master Immortal Tongxu's voice suddenly came from above. His voice was like rolling thunder, causing Fang Pan's heart to palpitate.He hurriedly collected his thoughts and looked around. Apart from the endless mountains and rivers, there seemed to be nothing else in sight.But immediately after, he suddenly lowered his head as if he had sensed something. He saw that there was a faint golden line of blood extending towards the bottom of the water under his feet.Fang Pan looked down and found that there was a blurry green figure under the water. It seemed to be near and far, real and illusory at the same time. He tried to see it clearly, but he couldn't.Just as he was about to lower his body and dive into the water to find out what was going on, the blood line under his feet suddenly became blurry and disappeared.He was slightly startled. Before he could think any further, the surrounding scenery spun and became distorted.When he came back to his senses, he found that he was still standing next to the bronze urn. He was bent over and holding the urn's edge with both hands.He looked down and saw that the liquid in the urn was still as black as ink. Everything that had happened just now was like a dream.\"Tell me, what did you see?\" The long-bearded old man's voice was heard.\"I'm ashamed, I didn't seem to see anything clearly \u2026 I only felt that the figure seemed to be near and far. It was quite blurry and I couldn't see it clearly.\" The black-robed Youth shook his head and told him what he had seen.\"As the saying goes, those who are closely involved can't see clearly.The reason why the Heavenly Secrets Urn is like this is because the owner of the blood essence is not in the Northern Frost Celestial Realm. He is in a secret realm in the Celestial Realm, or \u2026 in a small lower realm directly under the Celestial Realm, \"Master Immortal Tongxu said after thinking for a while.\"Immortal, can you further confirm which secret realm or lower realm that person is in?\" Fang Pan couldn't help but ask.\"Ridiculous!Do you think that the Celestial Realm is the same as those small realms? There are no markings and you can easily find someone with just a drop of blood essence? \"Master Immortal Tongxu snorted coldly and said with some displeasure.Fang Pan hurriedly cupped his hands and said, \"I was rude, please don't blame me.\"A moment later, outside the green mountain peak.Fang Pan stood in the air with his hands behind his back. His eyes were cold and his expression was uncertain.\"Humph!Even if you run to the ends of the earth, I will still tear you to pieces! \"As he spoke, he reached out to his waist and took out a communication disk array. He chanted a few incantations, then he pointed at his glabella with one hand and pulled it outward. A light curtain appeared in the palm of his hand.A tall Youth appeared on the screen. He was dressed in a green robe and had an ordinary face.As Fang Pan waved his hand, the light screen blurred and shrank before flying into the communication disk and disappearing.\u2026A few days later.In a deep valley in the northwest of Toyokuni, the valley was filled with thick mountain fog.From time to time, the rumbling sounds of explosions and the clashing of magic tools could be heard from the thick fog.Suddenly, accompanied by a thunderous bang, the mist burst open, and a green escape light flew out from inside.Inside the light was a green-robed young girl with three glowing green jade tokens hovering around her. They were fluttering around her, and she was standing on a dark green jade shuttle.The young girl was bright and beautiful. It was Liu Le 'er.Before she flew far, the thick fog in the valley rolled violently. Five escape lights flew out from inside and chased after her.The aura of the escape lights was extraordinary. They were all cultivators of the Nascent Soul Stage.Although Liu Le 'er drove the shuttle under her feet with all her strength, her speed was still a bit slower than the people behind her.In less than 30 minutes, the distance between the two sides was less than 300 feet!\"Who are you people? Why are you chasing me like this?\" Liu Le 'er made a gesture, and the escape light immediately stopped. She shouted at the back.The first streak of black light faltered, and a burly man with a curly beard appeared. He glanced at the flying shuttle beneath the young woman's feet, and made no attempt to conceal the greed in his eyes as he chuckled.\"Hehe, don't ask what you shouldn't ask.If you know what's good for you, obediently surrender and you can avoid physical pain. \"The other four escape lights also split into two and drew two arcs. They flanked Liu Le 'er from the left and right sides and surrounded her.The escape lights faded, and four figures appeared. They were a red-faced old man, a purple-robed young woman, and two black-robed Youth. They looked exactly the same. They seemed to be twins.\"So many people bullying the weak. Do you think that the disciples of the Leng Yan Sect are easy to bully?\" Liu Le 'er glanced at them coldly and said.\"A small Core Formation cultivator. You're really arrogant.Have a taste of this old man's power! \"The red-faced old man shouted and shook his sleeve.A red light flashed and a red ring shot out from his hand. It turned into a red shadow and rolled toward Liu Le 'er.In addition to the bearded man, the other three also took out a treasure. Under the control of a spell, it turned into three different colored magic attacks and attacked from three different directions.Liu Le 'er's pretty face froze, but she was already prepared. She waved her hands and muttered an incantation. The three green jade badges around her suddenly grew several times bigger. They turned into layers of badge shadows and shrouded her in the middle.With a loud rumbling sound, four dazzling balls of light exploded into existence!The green badge shadows flashed wildly and produced a series of cracking sounds. The spiritual light on the surface dimmed by more than half, but it was still able to resist the attacks of the four people.This startled all five of them, including the large man with the curly mustache.\"We can't stay here for long. We must finish the battle quickly. Be careful not to harm this woman.\"After the bearded man gave an order, he raised his hand and the item in his hand turned into a huge black brick that was more than 100 feet in size. He also joined the battle.Under the joint attack of the five Nascent Soul cultivators, the light on the surface of the green badge quickly dimmed.As a result, just before the badge shadow collapsed, Liu Le 'er calmly raised her hand and summoned a white silk magic treasure with lingering spiritual light. Its grade seemed to be no lower than the previous green jade badge.The white silk gently wound itself around the woman's head, and spiritual light flashed as layers of pristine white light appeared. White ripples proliferated in all directions, enshrouding the woman's body once again, and she became indistinct.The bearded man and the others were shocked and angry. They obviously didn't expect a Core Formation cultivator to have so many high grade magic treasures.However, it was clearly not the first time they joined forces. They all simultaneously increased the intensity of their magic power!Rumbles sounded everywhere!The white light suddenly trembled violently, but there were no signs of it breaking for a while.Liu Le 'er was surrounded by the white light. After she hastily took a pill, her hands quickly formed an incantation gesture. However, her small face was tense and her heart was extremely nervous.This was the first time she had to face several enemies with cultivation far higher than hers. After all, she was only able to kill the Deity Transformation cultivator Jia Ren by relying on the Flame Essence Bird that Han Li used a special method to seal in her body. If she hadn't taken a Spirit Whitening Pill that temporarily increased her magic power, it would have been impossible for her to kill Jia Ren in a single strike.The reason she was able to last until now was because of the magic treasures and spirit pills that Han Li gave her before he left. Even so, her situation was becoming more and more unfavorable.\"No, I can't let anything happen to me!I promised Big Brother that I would protect myself! \"The young woman gritted her teeth and her pale face slightly flickered. She suddenly raised her left arm and formed an incantation gesture.A profound silver spell formation suddenly lit up on her left arm.Accompanied by a clear cry, a silver firebird that was a little smaller than before flew out of it. It spread its wings and immediately flew out of the white light, flying to the side.Two \"puff\" sounds sounded almost at the same time!\"Ah, this \u2026 what is this!\"\"No \u2026\"Amidst the horrified screams of the two black-robed Youth, the silver flame instantly wrapped the two of them.This scene happened so suddenly that the bearded man and the other three people didn't even have time to react. The two black-robed Youth turned into a cloud of smoke in front of their eyes. Even their Nascent Souls didn't have time to escape and completely disappeared from the world.With such a moment of delay, the red-faced old man was also engulfed by the silver flame in a flash of silver light. His protective aura was useless, and he didn't even have time to scream.The bearded man and the purple-robed young woman who finally reacted were already terrified. They turned around and fled in different directions without saying anything.The former's cultivation was a bit higher than the latter's, so naturally, his speed was also a bit faster.The silver firebird didn't give the two a chance at all. It rushed down like lightning and turned into a blurred silver light. In the blink of an eye, it crossed a distance of thousands of feet and pierced through the purple-robed young woman's back, turning her into a ball of fire and falling straight down.\"Master, save \u2026\"It didn't take long for the bearded man's body to be submerged in the silver flame along with a shrill scream that stopped abruptly.The silver light circled in the distance and shot back like lightning. It flashed and flew into the young woman's arm, disappearing without a trace.Liu Le 'er's heart relaxed, but her face was already as pale as paper. Her body swayed a few times and she couldn't stand steadily.She quickly took out a spirit pill and swallowed it. Only then did her face regain some color.At this moment, a strange change suddenly occurred!The void above her head fluctuated. Then, a jet-black demonic claw appeared out of thin air and fiercely grabbed down.Before it really fell, there were waves of invisible fluctuations in the void below. An invisible spiritual pressure directly pressed down on the young woman.Chi!The white silk light protecting her body was already somewhat unstable. Under this spiritual pressure, it finally collapsed!The young woman turned pale with fright. She hurriedly wanted to use her spiritual power to cast an evasion technique to escape.But in the next moment, she felt her entire body tighten. She couldn't even move a finger, let alone make an incantation gesture. She could only look on helplessly as wisps of black light flew out of the demonic claw's palm. These wisps of black light condensed into a large black net and bound her body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"I didn't expect that a little demon fox like you would have such a heavenly flame.Oh \u2026 I see, it must be that Han brat who gave it to you. No wonder he is so difficult to deal with.But this is really an unexpected surprise. It seems that my opportunity has come!Haha \u2026 \"The black-robed old man stared at the silver seal on Liu Le 'er's left arm and laughed.Liu Le 'er was tied up by the black net at the moment. She couldn't move at all like a dumpling. After hearing the old man's words, she suddenly thought of something and cried out involuntarily,\"You are Qi Xuan from the Tengui School!\"\"Yes, I am Qi Xuan.It seems that you should also know the purpose of my visit! \"Qi Xuan's smile disappeared, and his face showed a hideous expression.\"You want to use me to lure my brother here? Don't even think about it!\"Liu Le 'er shouted angrily, and a trace of determination flashed across her pale and bloodless face.Then, the girl's eyes suddenly lit up with a dark green light. A crystal green light appeared between her eyebrows and flickered violently.Seeing this, the old man pointed with one hand, and a black light shot out. It instantly went into Liu Le 'er's eyebrows.The green light between Liu Le 'er's eyebrows flashed and disappeared. Before she could have any other thoughts, she fainted.\"Hmph!Now is not the time for you to die. When I catch that Han Li, I will burn you into ashes with the Earth Ghost Flame in front of my grandnephew's memorial tablet. You will never be able to reincarnate! \"After Qi Xuan muttered a few words to himself, his eyes returned to the girl's left arm again. After a slight hesitation, he turned his hand and took out a fiery red round bottle. It was densely engraved with various unknown runes.He threw the round bottle in his hand, and it floated in front of him. Then, he chanted and flicked his fingers. It seemed that he was slowly activating some kind of secret technique.After a long time, he let out a low shout and pointed at the round bottle with one hand.\"Poof!\"All the runes on the bottle suddenly lit up, and a fiery red light flew out from it.Dozens of fiery red crystal silk flew out of the light and flashed into the silver seal on the girl's left arm. Then, it pulled out.Buzz buzz buzz!The silver seal immediately shone brightly. Under the pull of the crystal threads, silver flames appeared.Qi Xuan rejoiced in his heart and quickly formed a seal with both hands.The light erupting from the mouth of the vial instantly became a lot denser, and even more translucent threads emerged from within before disappearing into the silver seal.Liu Le 'er's body trembled slightly, and her left arm twitched as she groaned.More and more silver flames were drawn out of the seal, forming the shape of half a silver firebird. However, its aura was extremely weak, and it seemed to be on the verge of falling asleep.At this moment, a burst of azure light appeared at the bottom of the seal, faintly emitting a power that wanted to pull the Firebird back.Seeing this, Qi Xuan let out a disdainful smile and spat out a mouthful of blood into the bottle.Immediately thereafter, brilliant red light erupted from the vial, and all of the translucent threads intertwined to form a pair of translucent chains that latched onto the Fire Raven's neck.Silver light flashed on the surface of the bird's body, and it awakened.It seemed to have noticed the chains on its neck, and it let out an angry cry. It spread its wings, and the silver flames on its body flourished as it spat out a silver pillar of fire from its mouth.As soon as the translucent chains came into contact with the silver flames, they disappeared in the blink of an eye. The pillar of fire pierced through the flaming red bottle without any reduction in speed, and continued to shoot toward Qi Xuan.Because of the suddenness of the incident, and the astonishing speed of the pillar of fire, it reached the old man in the blink of an eye.Qi Xuan was greatly alarmed, and without hesitation, he waved his hand to summon a small green shield to block. At the same time, his body shot back with a series of afterimages, appearing several hundred feet away. However, his left arm had been burned to ashes due to coming into contact with some of the silver flames.If it weren't for the fact that the flames seemed to be weak, he would have been severely injured even if he didn't die.He took a deep breath and took out a blood-red pill. The muscles on his severed arm squirmed frantically, and new flesh grew at a speed visible to the naked eye.After a few breaths, his left arm had regrown.The old man looked in the direction of Liu Le'er with a lingering fear.The fiery red bottle and the small green shield had already been completely devoured by the silver flames. After the silver Fire Raven's attack, the seal on the young girl's left arm flashed with a green light, and it disappeared without a trace.Although he was caught off guard and suffered a hidden loss, the more it was so, the more he looked at the seal with a burning gaze.\u2026 \u2026Within a verdant mountain range that had a winding landscape, mist rose and spirit energy suffused the air, and numerous exquisitely carved pavilions and palaces were distributed all over.In the sky above a remote valley, seven or eight figures swept from a distance, and descended toward the entrance of the valley.Among these people, the leader was a sixteen or seventeen-year-old boy. He was dressed in a snow-white robe, and his handsome face was full of arrogance.As soon as he landed, he immediately said to the others, \"Enter the valley immediately. This time, we can't let it escape no matter what.\"\"Yes!\"Everyone responded in unison, and immediately rushed into the valley.A grey-robed, white-haired old woman did not listen to the order like the others. Instead, she held a strangely shaped purple cane in her hand and walked to the youth's side.The youth looked at the old woman and said, \"Grandma Sun, you should also go. This Purple Cloud Marten is very cunning. If you don't act, I'm afraid it will be difficult for them to succeed.\"The white-haired old woman shook her head and said, \"Young master, this old woman is ordered by the temple master to protect you. You must not leave your post.\"The white-haired old woman shook her head and said, \"You are only entering the valley before me to capture the Purple Cloud Marten. How is that considered leaving my post?\"The youth frowned and said, \"The temple master ordered me to follow you closely. If anything happens to you, I will not be able to absolve myself of the blame even if I die ten thousand times.\"A trace of displeasure appeared on the youth's face. He said, \"This Gourd Valley is under the jurisdiction of my temple, and it is only a snap of the fingers from our sect. Who dares to come here? Isn't he tired of living?\"\"That may be so, but \u2026\"Before she finished speaking, she was interrupted by the youth impatiently, \"There is no need to say more. If you delay any longer and the Purple Cloud Marten escapes, I will report it to the Ancestor and hold you responsible.\"The old woman's expression became ugly, but she still hesitated and did not move.\"What are you waiting for?\"Seeing this, the youth immediately became angry.The white-haired old woman could only grit her teeth and heavily tapped the ground with her purple cane. She turned into a rainbow and rushed into the valley.The youth looked at the back of the old woman and was still a little annoyed. He waved his sleeve and walked into the valley.As a result, he had only taken two steps when he felt something strange behind him. He subconsciously looked back, only to see two deep blue lights shaking endlessly, and his Divine Sense immediately became blurry.In the void behind him, the green-robed Han Li slowly appeared. Blue light flashed in his eyes and he held a purple talisman between his fingers.He calmly put away the High One Invisibility Talisman. His lips curled into a smile and he walked in front of the youth.At this time, the youth's eyes were lifeless and his expression was lifeless. He stood motionlessly in place.\"Where is the Realm Temple's Condensing Star Platform?\" Han Li directly asked.\"On Nine Palace Peak \u2026 the peak.\" The youth's lips trembled as he replied.\"Oh, why is it not on the main peak, Jingtian Peak?\" Han Li asked with some confusion.\"Nine Palace Peak is the highest mountain and has the widest view from the top. It is more suitable for receiving the power of the stars, so the Ancestor placed the formation on this mountain.\" The youth answered without hesitation.\"Who is guarding the Condensing Star Platform? What is their cultivation?\" Han Li nodded and continued to ask.\"The arrangements of the temple \u2026\" The youth's face was expressionless. His mouth constantly opened and closed as he spilled out the situation on Nine Palace Peak.Nine Palace Peak was the largest peak of the sect, second only to Jingtian Peak. It was naturally an important place for the Realm Temple. Normally, a large number of sect elders and disciples cultivated there.However, the peak where the Condensing Star Platform was located was a large forbidden area in the sect. Apart from a few inner sect elders and a few core disciples, no one else was allowed to enter.According to the youth's description, the Condensing Star Platform was sealed by a powerful restriction and there was an unknown number of elders guarding it. It could be confirmed that there was at least one Unity Stage elder overseeing it.Han Li muttered to himself for a while before pointing his finger at the youth's forehead. Soon after, his figure disappeared like smoke.The white-clothed youth's eyes regained their clarity. He remembered that there was something strange behind him and quickly looked back. However, he saw that it was empty and there was no one there.He shook his head in confusion and continued to walk into the mountain valley.On the other side, Han Li's figure emerged from behind an ancient tree. He lifted his foot and was about to fly up.At this time, a ray of light suddenly shone from his waist. A yellow talisman flew out on its own and floated in the air.When Han Li saw this talisman, his eyebrows slightly wrinkled.\"Whoosh!\"A ball of fire soared in the air and the talisman spontaneously combusted.As the flames rose, a vague shadow appeared in the flames and gradually became clearer.In the shadow, he saw a green-robed girl lying paralyzed on a stone table. Her beautiful face was devoid of blood and her eyes were tightly shut. She had already fainted.Her slender wrist was tightly gripped by an emaciated and large hand.The owner of the hand was wearing a black robe. He had white hair and a black beard. His figure was skinny and he was looking at him with a malicious expression.\"You are Qi Xuan!\"Han Li looked at the old man and then at his robe. He narrowed his eyes and suddenly asked.\"Humph!Thief Han, two years ago you killed my nephew, Hao Er. Then you treacherously plotted against my good friend Lu Ya. Since then, you have been holed up in the Leng Yan Sect. You really made me look for you!Today, this little demon fox has fallen into my hands. Are you going to save her or not? \"The old man's face flashed with killing intent and he laughed cruelly.\"What do you want?\" Han Li's expression didn't change as he asked.\"Within a month, come to my Tengui School's Dark Ghost Peak of the Mang Yin Mountain Range.Remember, only you are allowed to come. If I don't see you when the time comes, don't blame me for being ruthless. \"Qi Xuan's voice suddenly became cold as he said.After saying that, he increased the strength of his grip on Liu Le 'er's wrist. The fainted girl frowned in pain and her face became even paler.When Han Li saw this, his face became gloomy and he remained silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHalf a month later.The Mang Yin Mountain Range.The sky above a steep mountain peak was shrouded in a layer of black clouds. Even though it was noon, there was not much sunlight shining down. It looked gloomy as if a storm was coming.The mountain peak was covered with trees, but it was not the usual green color. Instead, it was a slightly thick black color, making the entire mountain peak look like an ink painting drawn with thick ink.At this moment, in the dark clouds in the sky, a gap suddenly broke open. A light flew out from it, and a tall Youth wearing a green robe appeared.It was Han Li.He floated in the air, glanced around, and then closed his eyes. He slowly released his Divine Sense and swept it across the entire mountain peak.After a moment, his eyes suddenly opened, and a strange expression appeared on his face. Then, his body moved, and after a few flashes, he landed in a forest not far away that was shrouded in fog.After he landed on the ground, he walked forward for a short distance. After circling around a thick ancient tree, he saw a petite figure leaning motionlessly on half of a greyish-white withered tree amidst the white mist in front of him.\"Le Er.\"He furrowed his brows and called out to her.The petite figure heard the voice, and her shoulders moved slightly. Under the movement of her eyelashes, her originally closed eyes slowly opened.The moment she saw Han Li, the pale face of the woman suddenly showed a touch of joy. The corners of her mouth also pulled up into a forced smile. When she opened her mouth to speak, it seemed that her tongue was restricted, and she could only make vague sounds of \"Ah ah ah ah\".\"I'm here, don't be afraid.\" Han Li comforted her, and slowly walked forward.Seeing this, Liu Le Er seemed to think of something. Her beautiful eyes flashed with panic, and she shook her head at Han Li.Seeing that Han Li didn't stop, she struggled for a moment, trying to sit up straight. Suddenly, there was a \"Pa pa\" sound around her.Chains that flickered with black lightning appeared on the surface of her body, tightly binding her from head to toe. If she moved even the slightest bit, black lightning would flow out of the chains and fiercely strike her body.Seeing that Liu Le Er's small face showed a painful expression, Han Li's expression didn't change, but a trace of cold killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes, and he didn't stop walking.Just as he took his next step forward, before his foot touched the ground, a sudden change occurred!The originally calm white fog in the forest suddenly became incomparably dark and violently rolled. Then, under the roar of the wind, all the black fog instantly turned into a huge whirlpool.The surrounding temperature suddenly dropped, and \"Wu wu\" sounds of ghosts and wolves howling resounded!Han Li was at the center of the whirlpool. He only saw darkness in front of him, and there was an invisible suction force coming from the whirlpool. of light, of the whirlpool.Han Li snorted coldly and continued to stomp his foot. He walked toward Liu Le 'er in large strides without any obstruction.At this moment, a muffled rumble came from the ground!The ground on both sides trembled violently and shattered with a loud bang. A pair of ferocious ghost hands the size of a cattail leaf fan suddenly broke out of the ground and grabbed Han Li's legs from both sides.Almost at the same time, the black mist above his head dispersed in a frenzy, and a burst of invisible pressure came crashing down from above with devastating might.\"Boom!\" An earth-shattering sound rang out!A dark purple octagonal pagoda descended from the sky with the weight of Mount Tai, trapping Han Li inside.The giant tower was five to six hundred feet tall and covered in purple spirit patterns. It emitted an indescribably gloomy aura.All of this happened in the blink of an eye, and before Han Li could react in the slightest, he'd already fallen into a trap.\"Hmm \u2026\"Liu Le 'er watched this scene, and she immediately made a series of vague sounds. Her body couldn't help but struggle violently.However, the more she struggled, the tighter the chains that bound her body became. Streaks of snake-like black lightning flowed up and down, causing the woman's forehead to be dripping with cold sweat.The ghost mist around the giant tower surged, and four figures emerged from the surroundings in a flash.One of them was wearing a black robe. He was thin, had white hair, and a black beard. It was Qi Xuan.The person who faced him was wearing a yellow robe. He was a sturdy man with a square face. In the other two directions, there was a thin middle-aged man with a silver crown and a beautiful middle-aged woman in a scarlet robe.Without exception, these four people were all cultivators of the Soul Formation Stage. They all made the same gesture until they walked to the side of the giant tower.\"Hehe, Elder Tian, this time thanks to you borrowing this Purple Nether Tower, we finally caught this little thief in one fell swoop.\" Qi Xuan chuckled and cupped his hands toward the square-faced man.\"Elder Qi is too kind.But then again, you asked me to borrow this famous secret treasure from my master at all costs, but it was only used to deal with a mere Nascent Soul stage cultivator. Don't you think it's a bit overkill? \"The square-faced man showed a little pride on his face. He glanced at the giant tower and asked again.\"The reason why I'm so careful is also just in case. After all, Elder Lu Ya died in his hands. For this, I suffered a lot in the law enforcement hall.\" Qi Xuan sighed and shook his head gently.\"In any case, since Brother Qi has caught this person alive, don't forget what you promised us before.\" The beautiful woman in a red robe covered her mouth and said meaningfully.\"Haha, of course, everyone can rest assured \u2026\"Before Qi Xuan finished speaking, the giant tower in front of him shook violently, and the whole ground also shook. He was startled and swallowed the rest of his words.\"This is \u2026\" The beautiful woman in a red robe raised her eyebrows and asked in surprise.The silver-crowned middle-aged man standing across from him chuckled. Then, he said in an unconcerned manner, \"Don't worry about it. It's just the Rotten Ghost that I've raised. I think that kid is somewhat restless inside. He'll have to suffer a bit more.\"\"I didn't expect the ghost raised by Brother Luo could already shake the Purple Nether Tower. This is a little surprising.\" The beautiful woman in a red robe pressed her plump chest with one hand and said with a sigh of relief.As a result, as soon as the woman's voice fell, there was another muffled \"boom\" in the giant purple tower, and the power was a bit stronger than before.This time, Qi Xuan and the others felt the ground shake violently, and they faintly felt that they could not stand still.Looking at the ground again, within the range of a hundred meters below the giant tower, there were dense cracks that were deep and unfathomable, crawling all over the ground like a spider web.\"Brother Luo, is this also the work of your ghost?\" The beautiful woman in a red robe's face changed slightly, and she turned to ask the middle-aged man with a silver crown.The latter was just about to speak, but he couldn't help but let out a muffled groan, and a trace of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.\"How is this possible \u2026 my rotten ghost has been killed \u2026\" The middle-aged man with a face full of horror wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.As soon as this was said, Qi Xuan and the beautiful woman in a red robe were both shocked.\"It seems that Elder Qi's guess is correct. The strength of this little thief surnamed Han really cannot be underestimated.But you don't need to panic, the Purple Nether Tower is a Divine Spirit Treasure. Even if a Void Refinement cultivator is trapped inside, it will not be easy for him to escape. He is only a Nascent Soul cultivator, so how can he overturn the heavens? \"The square-faced man calmed down and said with great confidence.\"Even so, this treasure is controlled by a Body Integration cultivator after all. The four of us together can barely control it, so its effectiveness will inevitably be greatly reduced.In my opinion, why don't we use our full strength now and activate this treasure to kill this person? \"Qi Xuan frowned slightly and suggested with some worry.\"Brother Qi's words are reasonable. We should immediately kill him to avoid any changes.When the time comes, only his Nascent Soul will be left for us to deal with. \"The middle-aged man with the surname Luo revealed a ruthless expression and immediately echoed.After the four reached an agreement, they formed hand seals again and began chanting at the same time.All of the purple spirit patterns on the giant purple tower lit up and countless mysterious runes surged out. Above the tower, there were thick strands of purple Qi overflowing. The cold aura that filled the air increased greatly, causing the surrounding temperature to plummet. There was a loud crackling sound in the air and faintly, pieces of ice appeared out of thin air.At the same time, the entire tower seemed to become a bit heavier and was deeply embedded into the ground.However, before the four of them could breathe a sigh of relief.The giant tower shook again and the spirit patterns on its surface flashed wildly, rapidly growing larger.\"Not good!\"The square-faced man's expression changed greatly, but before the four of them could do anything else, the surface of the tower cracked and a huge crack appeared from top to bottom.Then, the giant tower rumbled and in front of the horrified eyes of Qi Xuan and the others, the giant tower suddenly burst open and a large amount of purple smoke billowed up.An indescribably strong wave of air swept in all directions. Although the four of them tried their best to resist, they still couldn't help but step back. A little further away, Liu Le 'er was also blown away by the wind.The fragments of the giant tower were scattered on the ground. The smoke and dust gradually dissipated, revealing a dark, ferocious giant ghost on the ground. It was about fifty or sixty feet in size and was lying on the ground with its four feet facing the sky. There was a large hole in its chest that was dripping with stinky black blood.On the head of the giant ghost, Han Li, wearing a green robe, glanced expressionlessly at Liu Le 'er. Seeing that she was fine, he then swept a cold glance at the four people around him.\"Could it be that you \u2026\"Under the shock of the four people, an unbelievable thought arose in their hearts at the same time.In the next moment, Han Li punched twice without saying a word.One of his punches hit the silver-crowned middle-aged man who was closest to him, and the other went straight to the beautiful woman in a red robe who was also not far away.The two only felt a monstrous wave of air pressing down, the surrounding air tightened, and their bodies sank. It was too late to avoid it.In a hurry, the silver-crowned middle-aged man's robe fluttered without any wind, and his two sleeves opened like trumpets, gushing out thick black gas.In the black gas, five bloody evil ghost heads opened their bloody mouths and rushed toward the wave of air.Immediately after, a blood-red ghost seal engraved with Yin characters also swelled in the void and turned into the size of a house, blocking in front of them.On the other side, the beautiful woman in a red robe was already pale. In a panic, she waved her wrist repeatedly, and thirteen white bone flying swords jumped out continuously, striking forward with the screams of evil ghosts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Bang! Bang!\" A series of continuous sounds came from both sides at the same time!Almost as soon as the five ferocious ghost heads appeared, they burst like ripe watermelons, and the blood-red ghost seal also burst into powder.On the other side, the thirteen bone swords also shattered inch by inch with a few \"pu pu\" sounds, turning into a handful of bone dregs. The blood-red round shield was also like a piece of paper, breaking from the center and shattering into pieces.Two miserable screams sounded almost at the same time. The silver-crowned middle-aged man and the red-robed beautiful woman's bodies were swept by the two fist winds, and instantly burst into pieces.A purple light flashed!A light purple two-inch tall Nascent Soul flew out of the former's corpse with a horrified face, trying to escape.However, as soon as the purple light on its body lit up, Han Li had already silently approached it. A big hand suddenly stretched out from the side, grabbed it, and pinched it.The purple Nascent Soul twisted wildly, still trying to make a last-ditch struggle. The big hand just rubbed it lightly, and with a \"puff\" sound, it was crushed into flying ashes.The red-robed beautiful woman's Nascent Soul didn't dare to soar into the sky. Instead, she took advantage of the moment when Han Li crushed the silver-crowned middle-aged man's Nascent Soul, and hurriedly rushed towards the depths of the forest.Han Li suddenly turned back, opened his mouth, and spouted a white gas, condensing into the shape of a flying sword, and flashed away.Suddenly, there was a rumbling sound in the forest ahead, and towering ancient trees suddenly collapsed.In the depths of the forest, a white light flashed, and the red-robed beautiful woman's Nascent Soul was directly split in half, and its light quickly dimmed.All of this seemed complicated, but in fact, it happened in a snap of a finger!The square-faced man and Qi Xuan took the opportunity to escape in the opposite direction at the same time, using their respective secret techniques.At this time, the burly man was stepping on a snow-white giant bone bird, and with a flap of his two huge white bone wings, he could jump two or three hundred feet away at an astonishing speed.Qi Xuan had a pair of ten feet long blood wings on his back, and his speed was a bit faster than the former, and he had already flown thousands of feet away.Feeling that the aura of their two companions behind them instantly disappeared, the two were shocked.The burly man flicked his wrist without saying a word, summoning a black and red octagonal copper mirror. The surface of the mirror flickered with black and red light as it shielded his back.He seemed to still be worried. He flicked his other sleeve, and nine small black flags appeared in a flash. They connected with each other in midair, and in the blink of an eye, they formed a thick layer of black light barrier that protected him impenetrably.At the same time, a series of cracking sounds came from within his body. His skin was torn and his clothes were torn. Sharp thorn-like bones protruded out of his body and fused together to form a set of white bone armor that covered his chest and other vital areas.On the other side, a ruthless look flashed across Qi Xuan's face. He raised his right hand and chopped off one of his arms.A large amount of blood sprayed out, turning into a blood mist that enveloped his body. He transformed into a ball of crimson light and fled into the distance at an incredible speed.Han Li frowned, but he did not give chase immediately. Instead, he raised his hand and pointed at Liu Le'er, who was not far away.A cyan light flew out and flashed into the woman's body.Suddenly, a black lightning chain appeared on her body, and then it shattered with a bang.\"Brother!\" Liu Le 'er exclaimed in a low voice. She was pleasantly surprised.Han Li smiled at her and then waved his hand gently.A dim black talisman flew out of the girl's body and exploded halfway. Five black mini mountains flew out of it and fell steadily into Han Li's hand.Han Li glanced at the two people who were flying away, and his arm became slightly blurred.Woo woo!Two of the mini mountains flew out of his hand and turned into two vague black shadows, shooting toward Qi Xuan and the square-faced burly man respectively. The distance between them was shortened at an amazing speed.The surface of the two mountains flickered with black light, and they grew to more than a hundred feet in size on the way. Wherever they passed, circles of invisible ripples appeared in the nearby void.The square-faced burly man and Qi Xuan felt a terrible force sweeping from behind, and their hearts couldn't help but thump.The former made a gesture with his hand, wanting to do something, but it was too late.The black mountain whistled and slammed into them fiercely.As soon as the octagonal copper mirror, the black flag, and all the other protective treasures touched the mountain, they cracked and shattered.The skeletal bird beneath his feet also let loose an anguished wail before its entire body exploded into countless bone fragments.The burly man was hit by the mountain. The bone armor on his body was broken, and his body also turned into a pool of blurred flesh and blood.Before his Divine Soul had time to escape, it was instantly crushed by the invisible force carried by the mountain.Qi Xuan was already seven or eight miles away at this moment. When he looked back and saw this scene, he was scared out of his wits.At this time, another black mountain was flying at lightning speed.At the critical moment, he groaned, and his eyes suddenly turned blood red. His body also instantly appeared a bloody color. Countless blue veins bulged on his skin, and his body rapidly inflated.\"Bang\", a loud noise!His whole body suddenly burst and turned into a huge blood-red light ball. Circles of blood-red ripples spread to the surroundings.The black mountain came like lightning, and was slightly slowed by the blood light.A two or three inches tall Nascent Soul that looked like Qi Xuan took the opportunity to shoot out from the blood light. After a flash of protective aura, it disappeared without a trace. The next moment, it appeared a thousand feet away. It then spat out a mouthful of blood essence, which turned into a mass of blood light that enveloped itself.He immediately turned into a streak of crimson light and flew off into the distance at an unbelievable speed.Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly, and he waved his hand downward.Liu Le 'er's left arm flashed with silver light, and a clear bird cry came out. Then, dense silver flames sprang out, and condensed into a palm-sized silver fire bird.The bird flapped its wings and flew into Han Li's hand.Han Li made a gesture with one hand, and the silver fire bird's body suddenly swelled several times. Then, it quickly elongated, and turned into a silver fire bow. Countless silver talisman characters danced around the bow's body.He didn't take out any arrows. Instead, he put his other hand on the bowstring, and gently pulled it.\"Hula!\"The silver fire bow blossomed with incomparable dazzling light. Suddenly, silver flames sprayed into the surroundings, and gathered on the bowstring. In the blink of an eye, it condensed into a silver fire arrow, and pointed it at Qi Xuan's Nascent Soul.At this moment, Qi Xuan's Nascent Soul had already flown over five kilometers away, but at this moment, it still felt a bone-chilling sensation coming from behind it. A sense of foreboding welled up in its heart, and its expression changed drastically.\"Stop!\"At this moment, a thunderous shout came from afar.At the end of the horizon, a dot of black light had appeared out of nowhere. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a rolling black cloud, and flew towards them at lightning speed.Qi Xuan's Nascent Soul was overjoyed to see this. It immediately changed its direction, and flew towards the black cloud.However, Han Li didn't pay any attention to that shout, and loosened his fingers.The silver fire arrow suddenly brightened, and disappeared into thin air.An ear-piercing sound was heard behind Qi Xuan's Nascent Soul, and a silver arrow shadow appeared out of thin air. It flashed, and pierced through the Nascent Soul.\"Bang!\" The Nascent Soul screamed in fright. The silver flame wrapped around it, and turned it into a mass of black fluorescent light in the blink of an eye.At this moment, the black cloud that had suddenly appeared also arrived in front of them. A wisp of black Qi flew out of it, and rolled towards the black Nascent Soul. Unfortunately, it only caught the drifting light.\"How dare you!\"Thunderclaps resounded in the black cloud. It was obvious that the person inside was extremely angry.\"Chi!\" A mountain-sized jet-black ghost claw suddenly stretched out of the cloud. It brought along gusts of chilly wind, and clawed towards Han Li's head.The ghost claw hadn't yet fallen, but its five fingertips spurted out a wisp of black ghost flame. It turned into countless black fireballs, and rained down on Shi Mu.Han Li remained unmoved, and a cold light flashed in his eyes. He clenched his hand, and suddenly punched the air.An enormous invisible force soared into the sky, and a mournful piercing sound rang out wherever it passed.A series of chaotic crackling sounds rang out!All of the black fireballs were extinguished like fireworks, and they drifted away without a trace.The jet-black claw was also stopped in midair by this enormous force. Then, a black light flashed on its surface, and it exploded with a loud rumble. It turned into countless wisps of black Qi, and then dissipated.A rumbling astral wind rose up, and it turned into a hurricane that soared into the sky. It easily tore apart the black cloud in midair.A black-robed, dove-faced old man appeared. His body slightly swayed, but he immediately steadied himself. He had a bewildered expression on his face.Han Li raised his head to look at the dove-faced old man. His expression was calm, but there was a trace of ridicule at the corner of his mouth.The dove-faced old man's complexion sank when he saw this. Without saying anything further, he turned his hand, and took out a dazzling silver object. He suddenly raised his hand and waved it.With a sharp whistling sound, that silver object shot out like an electric current, and went straight towards Han Li.However, halfway through its flight, it suddenly made a \"Pa Ta\" sound, and it automatically disintegrated.\"Bang!\"Countless rays of silver light burst out from the formation plate, and enveloped an area of more than a thousand feet. It enveloped Han Li and Liu Le 'er.Many silver magic characters appeared in the midst of the rays of light, and they issued Buddhist chants.\"This is \u2026\" Han Li thought of something, and was about to do something.At this moment, a mournful wind sound resounded, and a black light flashed within the silver light. It was incomparably fast, and it shot towards Liu Le 'er, who was not far away.Han Li's figure disappeared, and the next moment, he appeared in front of Liu Le 'er, and waved his arm.\"Bang!\" The black light was sent flying by his hand. It turned out to be a black flying dagger.At this moment, the silver light suddenly brightened, and it submerged his field of vision.Han Li's body was shrouded by a force, and the scenery in front of him rapidly changed.Soon, his field of vision was restored, and he appeared in a spacious area.\"Lesser Space Teleportation Technique!\" Han Li glanced around, and his voice sank.This place was a huge valley shrouded in dark clouds. On both sides, there were towering black peaks, and there were some indistinct buildings on top of them.At this moment, he and Liu Le 'er were in a huge square in the middle of the valley, and the dove-faced old man was floating in the air.The square was several hundred acres in size, and it was completely paved with black jade stones. Black Qi was gushing out from the black jade stones, and it formed a thin layer of black fog on the ground of the square, which condensed and didn't disperse.The entire square was like a sea of black clouds.In front of the square was a huge palace, towering and towering. The tallest palace had a black inscribed board hanging above it, and the three characters \"Heavenly Ghost Palace\" were written on it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlmost as soon as Han Li and Liu Le 'er appeared in the square, a sudden change occurred!The ground around the huge square rumbled and shook. Nine pitch-black stone pillars broke out of the ground and surrounded the large area in a circle.All the stone pillars were as thick as a person's arms, and they were more than a hundred feet tall. From the top to the bottom of the stone pillars, there were countless characters and runes engraved on them. The surface of the pillars was also inlaid with many shiny black crystals. They seemed to be some kind of special spirit stones, and they were shining with a bright black light.In addition, there was a ghost statue at the top of each stone pillar. Some had long tongues and some had wings on their back. They were all different, but they were all lifelike and abnormally ferocious, making people feel a chill in their hearts.Dazzling black light emerged from the ghost statues at the top of each stone pillar. They quickly connected with each other and formed a black hemispherical light curtain in the blink of an eye.On the surface of the light screen, dense black talisman markings surged and flickered ceaselessly. Under the roiling baleful qi, countless blurry ghostly shadows were formed layer upon layer, and shrill ghost howls rose and fell in succession, causing the scene to seem extremely bizarre.Liu Le 'er saw this scene and her heart trembled. She moved closer to Han Li.Although this woman was no longer the little fox girl who had never seen the world, she had never seen such a big battle. Her face was deathly pale.When Han Li saw this, he didn't even spare the old man a glance. He waved his hand and a silver firebird flew out from his palm. With a whoosh, it transformed into a silver fire net that covered Liu Le 'er's entire body.\"Stay inside, don't be afraid.\"When Liu Le 'er heard Han Li say so, her heart suddenly felt a lot more at ease.At this moment, the sound of breaking air resounded everywhere.Streaks of light flashed from the buildings in all directions, surrounding the square. They were all black-robed disciples of the Heavenly Ghost Sect.Not long after, the huge square was filled with dense figures. There were hundreds of people. It seemed a bit noisy, and there were still people coming from all directions.At this moment, Han Li turned a deaf ear to the commotion around him. His eyes flashed with blue light as he calmly sized up the nine stone pillars and the black light curtain around him.The disciples of the Tengui School who had gathered here thought that a strong enemy had invaded the sect. However, when they saw that there was only an ordinary-looking Youth in his twenties and a ten-year-old girl in the middle of the big formation in the middle of the square, they were stunned and looked at each other.However, seeing the gloomy expression on the old man's face, no one dared to step forward and say anything.The dove-faced old man didn't pay any attention to the people around him, and his figure flickered as he landed on a black stone pillar. He muttered an incantation, and with a wave of his sleeve, took out nine black formation plates, and quickly formed a series of hand seals.The nine formation plates flew out one after another and landed on the nine giant stone pillars down below, immediately fusing into the black light emitted by the stone pillars in a flash.The black light curtain flickered, and as more and more black talisman characters surged out, the thickness of the black light curtain increased by nearly half. The originally somewhat indistinct ghost shadows also became more solid and clear under the flickering of the talisman characters.The dove-faced old man saw this and let out a sigh of relief, but he still didn't stop his hand seals.At this moment, two grand lights flew over from a distance, and in the blink of an eye, arrived above the square. The lights disappeared, and two figures appeared.One of them was a white-haired old man with a ruddy complexion, and the other was a dark-skinned man.Like the dove-faced old man, these two were also Void Refining Stage cultivators.When the surrounding ordinary Tengui School disciples saw the three Inner Sect Elders appear at the same time, all the noise came to an abrupt halt.When the white-haired old man and the dark-skinned man appeared, they didn't bother to greet the dove-faced old man. At the same time, they released their spiritual sense to sweep Han Li and the young man below, and also swept the surrounding void.\"Elder Jiang, what happened? Why did you use the Lesser Displacement Voidspirit Disk to bring these two juniors into the sect? Moreover, why did you activate the Nine Great Ghost King Heavenly Pillars?Every time the formation is activated, it consumes a large amount of resources. \"The white-haired old man looked at the dove-faced old man and asked in a deep voice.The dark-skinned man also looked at the latter, clearly greatly puzzled.\"You two came just in time. Quickly lend me a hand and activate the formation to refine these two.\" The dove-faced old man formed an incantation gesture and urgently said.\"Activate the formation to refine these two low-grade cultivators?This Ghost King Heavenly Pillar Formation is a restriction that can even trap Body Integration Stage experts.Brother Jiang, you aren't joking, right? \"The dark-skinned man chuckled and didn't act according to the old man's words.The white-haired old man also didn't act.The nearby disciples also became restless, but because of the dove-faced old man, they didn't dare to make too much noise.Many people had already noticed that the man and woman trapped in the formation were at the Nascent Soul stage, while the woman was only at the Core Formation stage. Even among the disciples, they could find a large number of people who could kill them. The dove-faced old man was a grand Void Tempering cultivator, but he actually said that he wanted to activate the famous Nine Great Ghost King Heavenly Pillars in the Spirit Huan Domain. If news of this were to spread, wouldn't they become a laughing stock?The dove-faced old man hurriedly said, \"Don't underestimate them. Although this green-robed boy's cultivation is quite low, he is actually an extremely powerful Strength Cultivator.\"\"A powerful Strength Cultivator \u2026\" The dark-skinned man still shook his head with a smile.The white-haired old man lowered his head and looked at Han Li, who was still looking around inside the light screen, and even had a somewhat leisurely expression. The white-haired old man slightly frowned and was about to speak.Right at this moment, Han Li raised an eyebrow and stopped his wandering gaze as he murmured to himself, \"That's right.He inwardly muttered to himself, \"Since I'm here, I might as well settle this matter together.\"As soon as his voice fell, his figure flashed and he appeared in front of the light screen, leaving behind a series of afterimages. Then, he extended a white finger and casually tapped a certain spot on the light screen.An inconceivable scene appeared!After a light \"puchi\" sound, the entire black light screen suddenly shook violently and began to flash wildly. The ghost shadows that were originally baring their fangs and brandishing their claws unexpectedly began to scatter up and down as if they had lost their souls.The dark-skinned man's smile froze and he couldn't help but widen his eyes.The dove-faced old man's body shook and he opened his mouth to spit out a mouthful of blood. His hands rapidly formed a hand seal, trying to stabilize the formation with all his might.\"Not good!Quickly strengthen the formation, we can't let that person break out! \"The white-haired old man roared and his figure shot out, landing on top of a black stone pillar.The dark-skinned man also reacted. He was so shocked that he also wanted to fly to another stone pillar, but it was already too late.A faint light flashed on the surface of the black light screen and all the ghost shadows disappeared. Then, nine huge ghost faces appeared on the surface of the light screen facing the nine stone pillars. Their faces revealed a painful expression and they opened their mouths to issue a malevolent and ear-piercing scream.This scream was like a piercing steel needle. The disciples on the square held their heads and screamed. Some of the weaker disciples had blood flowing out of their ears and noses.After the screams, countless black talisman characters suddenly surged out from the nine huge ghost faces. Then, after a moment of blurring, they collapsed.The entire light screen then shattered like glass with a \"kacha\" sound, turning into countless black lights that drifted in the air!Not only that, but countless cracks also appeared on the ghostly statues on the nine black stone pillars. With a \"peng peng\" sound, they shattered into pieces.At this moment, Han Li had already retracted his finger. He held his hands behind his back and walked towards the nearby Liu Le 'er amidst the black lights that filled the sky.Liu Le 'er, who was enveloped by the silver fire net, had an excited expression on her face. If she weren't surrounded by a large number of enemies, she would have almost cheered out loud.When the three old men saw that the Great Array of the Sect had been so casually broken by the opposite party, they felt as if they had received a heavy blow in their hearts.The surrounding several hundred disciples of the Tengui School were completely dumbfounded as they blankly stared at the scene in front of them.\"You dare to destroy my Sect's Great Array!Die! \"The old man shouted loudly. He opened his mouth and spouted a white light that turned into a white bone blade. The back of the blade was inlaid with nine huge silver rings.His ten fingers changed like a wheel and shot out five or six secret techniques in succession.The nine silver rings on the bone blade issued a 'ding ding' sound that could confuse a person's mind. Then, countless blood-red talisman characters appeared on the surface of the blade. It blossomed with a dazzling blood-red blade light that was nearly a hundred meters long and chopped down towards Han Li's head.At the same time, the white-haired old man waved his arm like lightning and took out a simple and unadorned black crutch. The top of this crutch impressively had a black dragon head.The crutch rotated in the air and expanded in size. Then, it turned into a strange black Flood Dragon with a pair of wings on its back.The Flood Dragon opened its big mouth and spouted a large amount of black flames with a \"puchi\" sound.The dark-skinned man also took out a grey feather fan without the slightest hesitation. It seemed to have been made from the feathers of some kind of spirit bird. Then, he poured his magic power into the fan and fanned it with all his might.Suddenly, the color of the world changed and a gloomy grey wind whistled out. Then, it turned into seven or eight grey wind dragons and rushed towards Han Li.The surrounding disciples of the Tengui School didn't hesitate when they saw the old man and his two companions attack. They also took out a variety of magic weapons and started to mutter an incantation.Suddenly, all kinds of spiritual lights appeared one after the other.A crystal light flashed between Han Li's eyebrows as he saw this. Then, a huge spiritual sense flew out of it and shrouded the entire square in a flash. Buzz!Buzz! Buzz!An indescribably powerful Divine Soul power pressed down on him.Everyone in the square felt as if their minds had sunk.The surrounding disciples of the Tengui School suddenly saw countless stars flickering in front of their eyes. Then, their vision turned black and they started to fall down from the sky. They fell on the square and became paralyzed.The magic weapons that filled the sky suddenly lost control and fell to the ground.The old man and his companions were Void Refinement cultivators after all. Their spiritual souls were quite extraordinary. After their bodies trembled, they immediately recovered.The attacks of the three people didn't stop. Blade lights, black flames, and wind dragons arrived in front of Han Li in the blink of an eye.Han Li didn't move. He didn't have the slightest intention of dodging.\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\" Three loud sounds echoed!The blood-red blade light violently trembled and burst open. It turned into a white bone blade and flew back. The black flames and wind dragons were directly routed. They didn't cause the slightest damage to Han Li. Even his blue robe wasn't damaged in the slightest.As for Liu Le 'er, because most of the attacks were blocked by Han Li, she was unscathed under the cover of the silver flame net.\"How is this possible!\"The three people sucked in a breath of cold air. They couldn't believe what they had just seen.\"Isn't it my turn now?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as his voice fell, Han Li's figure blurred and disappeared without a trace.\"Be careful \u2026\"The dove-faced old man was startled and shouted loudly.As a result, before his voice fell, he only saw a blurred figure flash in front of him. His whole body was like a broken sack that was hit by a giant mountain. He fiercely hit a mountain outside the square and was embedded into the mountain wall. It was unknown whether he was alive or dead.\"Peng peng\" two muffled sounds were heard!The white-haired old man and the dark-skinned man watched helplessly as the figure of the dove-faced old man flew out. Before they could understand what was going on, they felt their vision darken. Then, their bodies flew in a certain direction as if they were riding on clouds and mist, fiercely smashing into the mountain wall.The entire square suddenly became silent.Liu Le 'er looked at the black mass around the square, as well as the various magic weapons and magic tools. Her small mouth was wide open, and she couldn't close it for a long time.Although she knew that her Brother Stone was very powerful, the scene in front of her was still far beyond her imagination. It felt like a dream.While this woman was still somewhat lost in thought, Han Li appeared beside her and asked with some concern:\"Le 'er, how are your injuries?\"\"Fortunately, I have the treasures that Brother gave me, so it's not a big deal.Not only does he covet Brother's spiritual flame, but he also wants to use me to lure Brother here.However, besides imprisoning me, he didn't do anything to me. \"Liu Le 'er shook her head and said with some lingering fear.Han Li nodded and sat down cross-legged. He took out a white medicinal pill and put it in his mouth.Previously, with his current Fa Li, even if he deliberately reduced the power of this Divine Sense attack, his Fa Li was still almost depleted.\"Brother, are we not going to leave now?\" Liu Le 'er was slightly startled. She looked around and said with some worry.Han Li made such a big movement in the square, and naturally, it alarmed the entire Tengui School. Rays of light flew out from everywhere and flew toward the square.\"Since you're here, why are you in such a hurry to leave?\" Han Li smiled and said without a care.A short moment later, the sound of something tearing through the air rang out, and several grand streaks of light flew over. In a flash, six figures appeared, and the auras they exuded weren't inferior to those of the three old men.When the few of them saw the situation, they were shocked and their gazes fell on Han Li.Although the few of them were somewhat bewildered, they released their spiritual sense and glanced at each other. They all tacitly pulled back a bit before summoning their magic treasures.A sharp whistling sound pierced through the air, and six different colored beams of magical weapons descended from the sky, attacking Han Li at the same time.Han Li did not get up. He still maintained his cross-legged posture. His body spun on the spot, and his arms became a blur. He punched in six different directions at the same time.\"Boom boom!\"The surrounding area fluctuated, and ripples spread out in all directions.Earth-shattering roars resounded everywhere. All the magical weapons seemed to hit an invisible wall, and six huge spirit balls burst out. The momentum was so great that it seemed as if the entire space was roaring.The light faded away, and Han Li, who was originally sitting cross-legged, was nowhere to be seen.The six people in the sky were startled. Then, a figure flashed in front of a middle-aged man with small eyes. Han Li's figure emerged, and without saying a word, he raised his hand and punched.\"Peng!\"He didn't have time to react, and his whole body was sent flying by a huge impact.While he was in the air, he heard five consecutive loud sounds coming from behind him. Then, he heavily hit something, and his vision went black. He was completely unconscious.After Han Li punched the other five Void Refinement cultivators, he returned to Liu Le 'er's side and stood with his hands behind his back.At this time, the rest of the Tengui School disciples who came from all directions happened to see this scene with their own eyes. They all stopped in shock and looked at each other, a little at a loss.These Void Refinement Stage elders who were usually high and mighty were now like flies that were casually swatted away by an ordinary-looking Nascent Soul cultivator. Some of them crashed into a certain part of the square, creating deep pits and sending broken rocks flying in all directions. Some of them directly crashed into the palaces nearby, causing them to collapse.In particular, the hundreds of semi-conscious disciples around the square and the magic treasures on the ground were even more shocking.At this moment, a white light shot from a distance, hovering above the Heavenly Ghost Hall that had collapsed more than half. From it, a burly man wearing brocade appeared.This person looked to be in his thirties or forties. His face was square, and there was a circle of short purple beard on his chin. His aura was quite vigorous.\"Supreme elder \u2026\"\"Elder Lu is here, that's great \u2026\"The square was in a complete mess. When everyone saw this person appear, a look of joy appeared on their faces. They all began to shout as if they had found their pillar of support.The man's gaze fell directly on Han Li. His expression was incomparably solemn, and he immediately began to quickly make a hand seal in front of him.\"A Body Integration cultivator \u2026\"Han Li glanced at the man and curled his lips. He flipped his wrist and black light flashed in his palm. A miniature mountain appeared.He spread his arm and suddenly waved it.The small black mountain flew out of his hand with a whoosh.The small black mountain flickered with black light midway, and it suddenly grew to a hundred meters in size, crashing directly toward the purple-bearded man.Before the mountain had even reached him, an astonishing aura surged toward him.The man was calm as usual, and his hands were making hand seals at an incredible speed.Just as the black mountain that had grown to a thousand meters tall was about to smash into his body, the man's hand suddenly stopped.A ball of dark purple light suddenly lit up under his feet. A hidden formation covered with runes suddenly appeared and instantly swallowed him.The mountain missed its target and smashed down towards the dilapidated walls below.At the same time, an identical formation appeared under Han Li and Liu Le 'er's feet. A purple light rolled down and swallowed the two.\u2026 \u2026In a hidden valley in the Mang Yin Mountain Range.The space here was narrow, and the light was dim. The valley was filled with rolling black fog. On both sides were rock cliffs that were more than a thousand meters tall. There were some strange patterns and some obscure ghost runes engraved on them.In the four corners of the valley, there was a tall bluestone pillar. The surface of each pillar was inscribed with dense runes, and they looked abnormally ancient.At this moment, the deep black ground suddenly flashed with purple light. Han Li and Liu Le 'er appeared in the empty space of the valley at the same time.Liu Le 'er was still covered by the fire net formed by the silver fire bird. When she was suddenly teleported here, she felt dizzy. Her body swayed a few times, but it was not a serious problem.As soon as Han Li stabilized himself, he raised his head and looked around.The purple-bearded man from before had appeared on a bluestone pillar. On the other three pillars, there were two men and a woman sitting cross-legged. They seemed to be meditating with their eyes closed.The woman wore a red gauze dress. She had a plump figure and a beautiful appearance. She didn't look old, but she had a mature charm.The other two were a one-eyed giant and a hunchbacked old man.The three of them had strong auras. They were all at the Body Integration stage.When the three of them sensed the disturbance in the valley, they opened their eyes at the same time. They looked at Han Li and Liu Le 'er with bewilderment. Then, their eyes fell on the purple-bearded man.\"Elder Lu, didn't you go to deal with the trouble in the Heavenly Ghost Square?Why are you back so soon? Why did you bring two outsiders into the forbidden area? \"The beautiful woman asked with furrowed brows.\"I don't have time to explain. This person is at the pinnacle of the Body Integration stage. Hurry up and activate the Earth Ghost Soul Suppression Formation!\" The purple-bearded man said with a grave expression.The three of them were shocked to hear this. Although there was a strange look on their faces, they didn't hesitate. They all flipped their hands and took out a black badge.The four of them, including the purple-bearded man, shouted at the same time. They waved their wrists and threw the badges out.Clang! Clang! Clang!Four sounds of metal clashing rang out. The badges flew straight down and landed around Han Li. They instantly burrowed into the ground.\"Go!\"A loud shout echoed in the valley.Han Li only felt that the ground under his feet suddenly trembled violently. A muffled sound like rolling thunder came from the ground.In a thousand feet around him, the soil was turned over and the rocks cracked. Four strange decorated arches broke out of the ground at the same time, surrounding him and Liu Le 'er in the center.These memorial arches had three rooms and four pillars, and they were about five to six hundred meters tall. The pillars were covered with the bones of humans and beasts, and there was a blood red skull hanging on the eaves, and it was like a red wind chime that lingered without end.In the middle of the decorated arches, there was a huge evil ghost head engraved. Some of them had a single horn with eyes like copper bells, and some had a human corpse in its mouth with blood dripping from the corner of its mouth.Seeing this, Han Li was about to take action. The giant ghosts on the four decorated arches seemed to have suddenly come to life. Their eight huge eyes rolled around and looked at him in unison.\"Chi Chi!\" A loud sound rang out!All the eyes shot out a large amount of bloody light at the same time. Under the intertwining flashes in the air, it turned into a rolling blood sea phantasm that pressed down, shrouding the space of thousands of feet around Han Li and Liu Le 'er.Han Li was situated within the sea of blood, and he was struck by a sense of immense gravitational force pressing down on his shoulders. All of his clothes clung tightly to his body, and even his movements became more sluggish.His eyes flashed slightly, and there was a continuous sound of firecrackers in his body. His body just shook a little, and he stood firm again. There was no strange expression on his face at all.The silver net that was covering Liu Le 'er twisted and deformed under the pressure of this gravitational force. There was even a large dent at the top, but after Han Li inserted several techniques into it, it was finally able to withstand it. The young girl who was trapped in it was first startled, but then her expression relaxed a little.The glamorous woman looked at Han Li and Liu Le 'er who were unscathed below, and said with a face full of disbelief,\"How could this be?\"\"It seems that we still underestimated this boy. This formation can at most temporarily trap him.But now that he is in the Demon Flame Valley, we can borrow the power of the Nine Heavens Demonic Flame left in the valley by the Bone Flame Ancestor to directly refine him. \"The purple-bearded man's eyes flashed fiercely, and he muttered.\"Do it!\"The one-eyed giant and the hunchbacked old man looked at each other and said in unison.The four of them immediately made a gesture at lightning speed, and their mouths also began to chant obscure chants.\"Weng Weng\" The chants continued to echo in the valley, causing the entire valley to tremble.On the cliff walls on both sides, fine mountain rocks rustled and rolled down, and the Ghost Dao Runes engraved on them shone brightly.Those patterns, which could not be seen clearly before, suddenly became alive at this moment. Each and every one of them struggled and twisted, turning into patches of black fire lotuses.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe black flames were rolling and the waves of fire were surging.These black flames were extremely strange. The sudden rise in temperature made everything in the valley feel as if they were in a furnace, but at the same time, waves of pitch-black Demonic Qi gradually spread out, faintly bringing with it an aura that made people tremble in fear.Han Li and Liu Le 'er, who were shrouded in the black flames, had to bear an even more appalling high temperature. Even the surrounding air became blurred and hazy.Liu Le 'er was so scared that her face turned pale at the moment when the surrounding Demonic Flame surged out.But the next moment, she found that she was in the middle of the silver flame net. The surrounding high temperature and rolling Demonic Qi seemed to be attracted by some kind of huge magnetic force into the silver flame, causing the air within a few feet to be abnormally cool. She suddenly felt a lot more at ease.Although Han Li did not have the silver flame to protect his body, he did not even blink in the face of the surging Demonic Flame. His expression was extremely calm.Just when the surrounding Demonic Flame was about to touch his body, he suddenly opened his mouth and a suction force immediately rolled out from it.The black devilish flames in the surrounding area were swept up by this suction force, transforming into bursts of black devilish flames that surged into his mouth like tidal waves.In just two or three seconds, most of the black flame had entered Han Li's stomach, causing the raging fire in the valley to suddenly weaken.This scene made the four cultivators at the Form Synthesis Stage stare almost out of their eyes, and they hurriedly stopped what they were doing.As a result, the black lotus on the surface of the surrounding cliff became blurred and returned to its original appearance, but the patterns were faintly faintly dimmer than before.But Han Li did not have the slightest intention to stop until all the black flames in the valley were completely swallowed. Then he closed his mouth with some reluctance and let out a muffled burp.\"How is this possible!\"\"The Nine Heavens Demonic Flame that can incinerate everything was actually \u2026\"\"What kind of monster is this person!\"\"Everyone, this person's Divine Ability is truly unimaginable. We must not hold back while he's still in the Earth Ghost Soul Suppression Grand Formation. Otherwise, there will be no end to our troubles in the future!\" The purple-bearded man had a serious expression as he cried out loudly.After saying that, he raised one hand and took out an ancient purple copper lamp that was less than half a foot long. In the obscure incantation, he stretched out his hand and gently rubbed it.\"Pu!\"A faint purple flame ignited on the surface of the ancient lamp. At the same time, countless rice-grain-sized purple magic characters emerged on the surface of the lamp.A thick purple smoke rose from the flame and quickly spread and expanded. In the blink of an eye, it condensed into a lifelike giant purple tiger that was the size of a loft. It raised its head high and let out a silent roar. Then, it pounced on Han Li with its four legs flying.The beautiful woman on the other stone pillar was chanting an incantation that fluctuated between high and low pitch, and a layer of red light had appeared in her eyes.The purple gauze dress on her body fluttered even though there was no wind, and she looked like a fairy who had descended to the world. Her skin and muscles were shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the nails on her slender fingers became long and black, turning into a pair of hideous, withered claws. As the flesh and blood on her beautiful face melted away, her whole body turned into a pink skeleton!He swooped down at an astonishing speed, and in the blink of an eye, he appeared not far away from Han Li, leaving a trail of afterimages in his wake as he made a grabbing motion with one of his shriveled claws.The space above Han Li's head fluctuated, and a white bone claw the size of a small hill stretched out. The five bony fingers were like sharp blades, and with a sharp wind sound, it fiercely grabbed toward Han Li's head. The rolling grey evil spirit swept out from the palm.The bone claw didn't seem to be affected by the rolling blood sea phantasm at all!Han Li stood in the same place and didn't move. Without saying anything, he raised one of his hands, and a mini black peak flew out of his hand. Under the wind, it turned into a black mountain peak and fiercely smashed on the white bone claw.\"Boom!\"The black mountain peak burst open under the bone claw, and it turned into a sky full of huge stones that rained down. However, the bone claw also trembled and collapsed with a few \"ka la\" sounds.The evil spirit that filled the sky dissipated, and only countless white bone fragments were left.The pink skeleton still wanted to do something, but an earth-shattering airwave rolled up from below. It was like a willow in the wind, and it flew out without any resistance. It heavily hit the side of the mountain wall, and scattered into a pile of bones.At this moment, a roar that sounded like a tiger's roar rolled down!It was the giant purple tiger that broke through the air. It opened its mouth, and a purple light beam shot down.Han Li merely made a grabbing motion with a single hand, and a burst of enormous invisible force swept forth, vanquishing the pillar of purple light amid a resounding boom. Immediately thereafter, he leaped into the air and appeared beneath the tiger's abdomen, completely defying the gravitational pull of gravity.His arms stretched out like lightning. One hand grabbed the giant tiger's head, and the other hand grabbed one of its hind legs. The muscles on his arms swelled like two big pincers. No matter how much the giant tiger struggled, it couldn't break free!Just when he separated his hands and was about to tear the tiger into two halves, the ground below suddenly made a \"bang\" sound. Then, four giant black spears flashing with a dim light broke out of the ground. They passed through the layers of blood sea, and suddenly pierced towards his chest and abdomen.\"Clang!\" a sharp sound was heard!The four giant spears seemed to have smashed into an iron wall. They were shocked by a huge force, and they trembled and shrank back.\"Gu Gu!\"A strange sound was heard. The mud and stones on the ground were turned over, and a giant black spider popped out.There were two rows of white compound eyes on its head, and eight long legs like steel spears. They were as thick as a child's arm, and there was a gray meat bag hanging under its abdomen.Han Li squinted his eyes slightly. He found that the meat bag was the hunchback old man, and this spider seemed to grow out of the bulge on the old man's back. It was extremely strange.As soon as the black spider appeared, its two sharp front legs crossed again, and a bloody red light appeared on them. It looked like a big burning scissors, and it went straight to Chu Yunsheng's neck.However, this time, Han Li didn't give him the slightest chance. He grasped the huge purple tiger tightly with both hands and rapidly leaped down using the immense force of gravity. Along the way, he raised his right leg and swept it horizontally.\"Bang!\" a loud sound was heard!The two front legs of the spider were shattered inch by inch, and its body also flew out under the impact of a huge force. It heavily smashed into the stone wall on one side, and was buried by the falling boulders.As soon as Han Li landed on the ground, he exerted force with both of his arms and tore the giant purple tiger in his hand into two halves.Then, something unexpected happened!The giant purple tiger that was torn apart did not dissipate. It turned into a large purple mist and rolled down, shrouding Han Li in it.The purple mist exuded a strange fragrance. It seemed to have some kind of special ability to absorb people's souls and erode the mind of cultivators.\"Brother!\" Liu Le 'er in the distance saw that the situation was not good, and she couldn't help but exclaim.\"Hehe, so what if your physical body is strong? Under Elder Lu's Soul Eroding Ghost Fog, what can you do \u2026\" Not far away, the bones reformed into a pink skeleton. It stood up shakily and let out a sneer.As a result, before it finished speaking, it heard a heart-wrenching roar coming from the top of a stone pillar above.At this time, the purple-bearded man had already turned over and fell from the stone pillar. He rolled on the ground with a painful face, and the ancient purple copper lamp from before had rolled aside.The mist that the giant purple tiger turned into dissipated with a tremble, revealing Han Li's figure. He waved one hand, and the ancient purple copper lamp came to him in a blur. After he checked it, he casually put it into the storage bag.At the same time, a crystal light flashed, and a slender crystal silk flashed out of the purple-bearded man's head, and it rolled back to his brow.After that, he turned his gaze and said faintly to the tall archway on the left, \"Why?Haven't you found a chance to sneak attack? \"As soon as he said that, a figure flashed out from behind the archway, and he quickly rushed back. It was the one-eyed muscular man who had not made a move.At this moment, his whole body was covered by a bone armor full of spikes, and he held a blood-red crystal-clear giant axe in one hand. It seemed to be a superb magic treasure with extraordinary power.But after this person stood firm, he just looked at Han Li with vigilance. He didn't intend to rush up and fight desperately.Just then, he had witnessed Han Li pummeling the three Body Integration cultivators to the point where they couldn't even put up a fight in the blink of an eye, and he was struck by a sense of helplessness from beginning to end.This feeling of powerlessness in the face of an opponent had not been felt for many years.When Han Li saw him appear, he withdrew his gaze, turned around, and walked toward the Earth Ghost Archway in front of him unhurriedly.From the changes in the folds of his clothes, it could be seen that the surrounding blood sea restriction was still firmly pressing on him. Although his pace was not fast, it was obviously not very strenuous.Walking to the front of the archway, after taking a look at the pillars of the archway, he suddenly bent down and reached out to hug one of the pillars. His waist and arms suddenly exerted force, and he suddenly lifted up.The whole ground shook with a bang, and the eyes of the giant ghost head on the archway had a hint of human-like horror!The entire archway swayed and swayed before growing taller and taller, and in the end, it was forcibly uprooted from the ground.After leaving the ground, the giant ghost head let loose an anguished wail. Black light flashed from the archway, and it suddenly shrank into a black badge that fell into his hand. The blood sea projection that encompassed a radius of several thousand feet also tumbled violently before shrinking significantly.Han Li stowed the badge away before making his way toward another archway...At this point, the hunchbacked elderly man and the purple-bearded man had already crawled up from the ground, and the beautiful woman had also reverted to her original appearance.The four Body Integration cultivators of the Tengui School were situated in four different corners of the valley, and they looked on as Han Li stowed away the Earth Ghost Archways that formed the Earth Ghost Soul Suppression Formation one by one with complex expressions on their faces, but none of them stepped forward to stop him.No one said anything, and it was as if they were waiting for something.Half an incense stick of time later, when Han Li stowed away the final black badge, his brows suddenly raised slightly, and a peculiar look flashed through his eyes.\"It's finally here.\"After murmuring to himself, he suddenly opened his mouth and abruptly exhaled.\"Hula!\"A large amount of black flames rolled out, and it turned out to be the demonic flames that had been sucked in by him before.These demonic flames rose into the sky and gathered in the air, condensing into four wheel-sized fire clouds. Under a series of distortions, they instantly turned into four black fire pythons that were several tens of feet long, and they pounced toward the one-eyed giant and the other three.The four were shocked to see this, and they immediately released several defensive magic treasures of different styles, transforming into layers of protective shields around their bodies.\u2026 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven though the four Body Integration cultivators had immediately unleashed many defensive measures, their backs were still drenched in cold sweat.These four black flame pythons appeared to be only around 30 to 40 feet in length, but they were clearly condensed from the vast amounts of Nine Heavenly Devilish Flames that had filled the entire valley. As high-grade cultivators of the Tengui School, no one was more aware of just how fearsome these flames were than they were.Even a Body Integration cultivator would be in deep trouble if they were not careful.Never did they think that they would be facing these devilish flames head-on one day.Right at this moment, the sound of something tearing through the air suddenly erupted.A streak of white light flashed through the air above the valley before splitting up into four and hurtling down at an extremely fast speed, appearing before the four cultivators as if they'd teleported.These were four shimmering sword projections!The sword projections flashed before transforming into four sword wheels that were each around 10 feet in diameter.Almost in the next instant, the four black flame pythons crashed into them.A string of resounding booms rang out.Countless balls of black flames exploded on the surface of the four sword wheels, following which a series of invisible fluctuations surged through the air.The four ferocious black flame pythons were instantly destroyed, transforming into plumes of black smoke that dissipated into nothingness.Immediately thereafter, spatial fluctuations erupted in the air above the valley, following which a black-robed man in his forties appeared. He had regular facial features and a refined appearance, but his brows were as dense as swords, giving off a sense of killing intent.The four translucent sword projections transformed into four streaks of white light again before disappearing into his body from the four corners of the valley.\"Martial Uncle Duan!\"The purple-bearded man and the others heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing this, and they were all ecstatic to see the figure in mid-air.Han Li stood on the spot, and his pupils contracted slightly as he looked directly at the man before him.Needless to say, this man was naturally one of the two Grand Ascension Stage beings of the Tengui School, Duan Renli.Duan Renli cast his gaze around to find that the Demonic Flame Valley, which was a restricted area of the sect, was in complete disarray, and the four Body Integration cultivators were also in dire straits. His expression remained unchanged, but his eyelids twitched slightly.He lowered his head slightly, and his gaze fell on Han Li. He didn't make any hand seals, but he just stretched out his palm and slowly pointed down with his five fingers.His five fingers suddenly became extremely translucent, and spiritual light flashed from his fingertips.\"Sou sou\" sounds rang out one after another!Beams of white light shot out from his five fingertips and expanded in the wind. Then, they transformed into hundreds of white bone flying swords, each about a foot long. Along with a shrill whistling sound, these flying swords rained down on Han Li.Seeing this, Han Li just made a gesture with one hand. Suddenly, a burst of firecracker-like muffled sound came from his body. His figure skyrocketed, and his body surface shone with golden light. Pale golden scales emerged from his body and instantly covered his whole body.The white bone swords that covered the sky arrived in an instant and struck the surface of his body, causing it to erupt with balls of alternating gold and white light that drowned his body. Moreover, it emitted an explosive sound that was like rain striking a fence!Circles of air waves exploded nearby, sweeping in all directions like a hurricane, causing countless thin white marks to flicker in the air within a radius of a hundred feet.At the same time, a thousand feet above the center of the explosion, there was a fluctuation, and a small black seal appeared out of thin air. In a flash, it turned into the size of a pavilion, and released thousands of black light rays that descended from the sky.It hadn't even descended when a suffocating spiritual pressure caused the nearby space to warp, and its might was shocking to the extreme.An earth-shattering loud noise!The giant seal was a few feet above the ground, and its falling momentum stopped. It couldn't fall any further.Seeing this scene, Duan Renli's face finally showed a trace of emotion.Although he had just used two great magical powers in one breath, in reality, it was only a breath's time. At this time, after the gold and white light receded, the situation was revealed.Han Li stood firmly in place, motionless. He raised his right arm that was covered in golden scales, holding up the giant black seal. Both of his feet had sunk into the deep black ground, and cracks had appeared around him.He grinned at Duan Renli in midair, revealing a mouthful of snow-white teeth. Then, he bent his right arm and suddenly straightened.Suddenly, a deafening roar sounded, and the black seal that seemed to be as heavy as Mount Tai was forcibly thrown up like a piece of wood. With an incredible speed, it flew out of the valley's entrance and disappeared without a trace.Then, his feet suddenly stepped into the air, and after a flash, he strangely appeared not far in front of Duan Renli. His arm slightly blurred, and he was about to throw a punch at Duan Renli.Seeing this, the latter's expression didn't change in the slightest, and he only narrowed his eyes.At this time, the void behind Han Li flashed, and a silver ring silently flew out.He quickly turned around as if he had already expected it, and with a light chop of his hand, the ring was cut open.Then, a strange scene appeared!The talisman characters on the surface of the two silver rings curled up, and they suddenly turned into a series of afterimages as they disappeared into thin air.The next moment, the two strangely appeared on either side of Han Li.\"Keng!\" A light sound rang out!Han Li felt his body tighten, and the two silver rings suddenly came together in the middle, forming a complete ring that tightly locked his body.The ring shone brightly, and suddenly tightened. When the inner ring came into contact with the golden scales, sparks flew everywhere, and a crackling sound was heard. It seemed as if the ring would be crushed by this huge force in the next moment.\"Brother!\" Liu Le 'er had already retreated to a corner of the valley, and seeing this, she immediately cried out in alarm.When the purple-bearded man and the others saw this, they were delighted.Han Li didn't panic in the slightest. He immediately clenched his teeth, and let out a low shout.Suddenly, a muffled thunder-like crackling sound came from his body, and five blue light spots suddenly appeared on his chest. The muscles of his whole body fiercely swelled, and his body suddenly became one size bigger.He suddenly stretched his arms, and the silver ring flashed wildly as it was forcibly expanded. Then, countless silver talisman characters appeared on its surface, and crazily jumped. Then, a \"Kacha\" sound was heard, and it exploded.Duan Renli's complexion finally became serious, and his figure shot backwards. His sleeves bulged, and it seemed as if he was about to activate other magical treasures.But how could Han Li let his opponent attack so easily? His shoulder swayed, and he disappeared from his original position in a blur.The next moment, the figure behind Duan Renli, who had flown a distance of a thousand feet, suddenly blurred. Han Li's figure appeared like a ghost. He clenched his fist without saying anything, and blasted out a punch.His fist was shining with golden light, and it seemed as if it was cast from pure gold. Wherever the fist wind passed, a white mark was drawn out of thin air!Duan Renli suddenly turned around, and opened his mouth to spit out a cloud of blood. It condensed into a blood-red light shield, and blocked in front of his body.A \"Boom\" sound was heard!Han Li's fist bombarded on the blood shield, and the surface of the shield caved in deeply. Then, it collapsed with a loud bang, and turned into a large expanse of blood mist. The fist momentum didn't stop, and it directly penetrated Duan Renli's chest.But, there wasn't the slightest hint of joy on his face. Instead, he coldly snorted.Duan Renli's entire body instantly burst open with a \"Poof\" sound. Then, a large expanse of blood mist drifted away, and his entire body turned into a white skeleton. Then, it hung on Han Li's arm.The void fluctuated a thousand feet away, and Duan Renli's figure silently appeared. He seemed to be unscathed, but his complexion was faintly pale.A series of unforeseen events happened in a flash. The purple-bearded man and the others couldn't help but look at each other when they saw this situation. They saw a trace of horror and shock in each other's eyes.\"I didn't expect that a power cultivator like you, who is comparable to a Great Ascension Stage cultivator, would appear in this world after only a few hundred years of closed-door training.May I ask for your name? \"Duan Renli looked up and down at Han Li. It seemed as if he wanted to confirm again. Then, he slowly said.\"Daoist Duan, you flatter me. I am Han Li.\"Han Li smiled slightly and casually threw the white skeleton to the side. The pale golden scales on his body faded away, and he didn't make another move.\"It turns out to be Friend Han.However, since you have such strength, you should maintain your identity. Why did you come to my Tengui School to cause trouble, and even bully my disciples? Shouldn't you give me an explanation? \"Duan Renli's voice suddenly sank.\"Hehe, the Tengui School will be the first to complain.You kidnapped my people first, and then used a secret technique to forcibly teleport me here. I still want to ask you to give me an explanation. \"Han Li's mouth twitched, and he sneered.Duan Renli was slightly startled when he heard the words. He glanced at the purple-bearded man and the others below and asked:\"What happened?\"Several people looked at each other, and the other three looked at the purple-bearded man.\"Reporting to Master Duan.I previously received a message from the sect saying that someone broke into the mountain gate, so I went to investigate.When I saw that this \u2026 this Friend Han's magic power was powerful, I activated the restriction and teleported him here.As for why this person came to my Tengui School, I'm really not very clear. \"The purple-bearded man hesitated for a moment, and said so.\"Investigate this matter immediately!\" Duan Renli heard the words, and ordered in an unquestionable manner.\"Yes.\" The purple-bearded man quickly responded, and quickly flew out of the valley.Duan Renli's gaze returned to Han Li's face, and he didn't say anything.Han Li looked down at a certain place, and after using his eyes to signal Liu Le 'er not to worry, he wore a faint smile on his face, and looked at the purple-bearded man.After about half an hour, the purple-bearded man returned to the valley, and respectfully transmitted his voice to Duan Renli for a while.Duan Renli frowned slightly, but he immediately returned to normal and waved his hand.The purple-bearded man hurriedly retreated to the side.\"So Friend Han is from the Leng Yan Sect?\" Duan Renli looked up at Han Li, and slowly said, as if he was considering his words.\"That's right.\" Han Li calmly said.Duan Renli's eyes flashed slightly, and he said with a smile, \"I didn't expect your sect to be so low-key. Even with a strength cultivator like you, you haven't revealed any information about it. Congratulations.\"\"Fellow Daoist Duan, it's best not to change the subject.\" Han Li said with a faint smile.\"I've basically figured out the situation.You had some grievances with an outer sect elder, and as for everything that happened after, it was all a misunderstanding.Since that person is dead, and the matter has been cleared up, there's no point in us fighting anymore.How about we stop here, and I'll get someone to escort you and your companion away? \"Duan Renli was silent for a moment, and so he said so.In his opinion, although Han Li didn't seem to have a high cultivation base, he had clearly used some kind of method to hide his true strength. Now that the sect's other Grand Ascension Stage cultivator happened to be away, continuing to fight would not be worth the loss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How dare you make such an outrageous request!\"\"Wishful thinking!\"After a short silence, before Duan Renli could speak, the voices of the purple-bearded man and the other three came from behind him. Their words were filled with anger.\"Fellow is really demanding an exorbitant price.A Yin Chen Stone mine can't even refine 500 kilograms in a year. Friend Han wants to take 100 kilograms at once. Don't you think it's a little too much? \"Duan Renli's expression did not change, but there was a hint of coldness in his words.\"Han doesn't think that such a big Tengui School can't even take out this amount of Yin Chen Stones after so many years of accumulation.\" Han Li said with a chuckle.\"It seems that you're deliberately causing trouble.Since you're not willing to leave, then stay forever! \"Duan Renli's face was vaguely ferocious. It seemed that he was completely infuriated by Han Li's attitude.As soon as he finished speaking, a large blood light suddenly appeared on his body, illuminating the surroundings in a blood red color. It also emitted a terrifying spiritual pressure that almost froze the surrounding space. He opened his mouth and spat out a blood red mini ancient flag that was a few inches tall.The flag spun and turned into a giant flag that was a few feet tall. It was surrounded by a murderous aura and a hideous ghost head with two horns on its head could be clearly seen. It had a green face and fangs, and its eyes were tightly shut.As he quickly chanted an incantation, crimson light began to revolve around the huge flag, stirring up a gust of bloody wind. The sinister ghost head opened its mouth and released a thick crimson streak of light towards Han Li with overbearing momentum.Before the light arrived, a nauseating smell of blood immediately filled the entire canyon. The temperature of the surrounding air suddenly dropped by a few degrees.Han Li's body swayed gently in mid-air upon seeing this, and he abruptly transformed into a series of afterimages, thereby allowing the crimson streak of light to strike empty air.In the next moment, there was a fluctuation behind Duan Renli. Han Li's figure appeared out of thin air. A fist that was covered with light golden scales moved and turned into countless shadows. It was as if hundreds of fists were thrown at the same time.In an instant, there was a loud whistling sound!An astonishingly huge force passed through the dense fist shadows and came crashing down. Wherever it passed, the void seemed to shatter inch by inch.In the face of such a shocking attack, Duan Renli merely extended a finger and pointed at the blood-red banner in front of him in a seemingly slow but actually swift manner.Suddenly, the banner turned around at lightning speed, and a large amount of blood-red mist sprayed out from the banner. It quickly spread out, and turned into a mass of blood cloud with a radius of several hundred feet. It shrouded his entire body, and his figure became indistinct.The golden fist images descended successively onto the blood red clouds like raindrops, yet they actually seemed as if they'd struck a ball of cotton, and the extraordinary might contained within them actually vanished without a trace like a clay ox entering the sea, causing it to seem extremely strange.Furthermore, every fist shadow that entered the blood cloud vaguely caused it to expand a little.Han Li frowned slightly. He withdrew his arm without thinking, and his body immediately turned into a shadow that retreated backward.The crimson clouds in the surrounding area immediately began to tumble and churn like a tidal wave before rapidly spreading to both sides, and a series of crimson vortexes materialized within them. As they rotated, shockwaves swept forth in all directions like gale-force winds, causing the nearby space to twist and warp.Ear-piercing roars came one after another. Han Li only felt that the air around him was tight. A huge force surged from all directions, causing his retreating momentum to stagnate slightly.At this moment, the ferocious giant ghost on the surface of the blood-colored ancient flag suddenly opened its eyes. Two balls of red light like the scorching sun emerged. It was so dazzling that people couldn't look directly at it!Han Li only felt dizzy, then the surrounding scenery became slightly blurred. He suddenly appeared in a bloody space.Above his head was a bloody sky, but below was a boundless vast blood sea. A thin layer of blood mist floated on the surface of the sea, and the air exuded a slightly sweet smell.\"Treasure of the cave!\" A hint of surprise appeared in Han Li's eyes.\"You are quite knowledgeable.Yes, this Crimson Blood Heavenly Ghost Flag is a treasure of the cave, and it is also the secret treasure of our sect.You should consider yourself lucky to be buried here today. \"Duan Renli, dressed in a black robe, was standing in the air not far away with his hands behind his back. His clothes were fluttering, and his body was surrounded by blood mist.\"Oh, is that so?\" Han Li said indifferently.As soon as he said this, there was a burst of ghost howling from all directions.These sounds were far and near, rising and falling. It was as if countless ghosts were crazily howling, echoing non-stop.Han Li's eyelids suddenly became heavy, and his consciousness became dazed. Suddenly, a bloodthirsty and irritated feeling arose in his heart. It was as if he could only calm down if he immediately rushed forward and fought with those ghosts.However, he did not hesitate in the slightest. Immediately, a cool force surged out of his dantian and instantly flowed through his meridians.The crazy thoughts in his mind immediately disappeared, and the ghost howling around him also disappeared without a trace.Duan Renli saw that Han Li's body only shook slightly, then returned to normal. He could not help but be surprised.The bewitching blood mist floating on the surface of the blood sea was a collection of thousands of ghosts' resentment. It was enough to confuse one's mind and trigger the desire and murderous intent in the deepest part of one's heart. Even if one was caught unprepared and fell into it, one would be affected to a certain extent.This strength cultivator in front of him was not affected at all. Could it be that his consciousness was much stronger than his?If that was the case, the trump card that he originally prepared naturally could not be used.At this moment, Han Li's eyes flashed and his body shot out in a blur, heading straight for the black-robed man opposite him.Duan Renli snorted coldly and made a hand sign.Boom!The blood sea below him suddenly churned violently. Suddenly, an incomparably huge wave of blood rose and swept his body away without a trace.Seeing this, Han Li's body stopped in mid-air. He closed his eyes and released his powerful consciousness. However, he immediately frowned slightly.This space actually seemed to be boundless, and the sea of blood below was extremely strange. With the strength of his Divine Sense, he was actually only able to penetrate a mere 30m into the bottom of the sea, let alone find out where the other party was hiding.He thought for a moment, and a blue light flashed in his eyes. He used the Brightsight Spirit Eyes.Immediately, everything within a hundred feet of the blood sea became clear. However, further down, it was still hazy and he could not see through it at all.Just as he flipped his hand and took out a Cloud Crane Grass to eat, he circulated most of the spiritual power in his body into his eyes and prepared to use the Spirit Eyes Spirit Eyes, a sudden change occurred!A few hundred feet in front of him, the blood red sea suddenly churned violently. The viscous blood water flowed in a certain direction and formed a huge whirlpool. There was a faint low rumbling sound coming from it.Seeing this, Han Li's body swayed without hesitation and he flew a few hundred feet into the air. Only then did he look down at everything below him.There was a rustling sound in the center of the whirlpool. Then, the waves rolled down and an incomparably huge skeleton rose from it.This skeleton was a few hundred feet tall and its bones were crystal red. It seemed to be made of blood jade and there were countless mysterious runes engraved on it.On its hill-like head, in the middle of two curved horns, a dark red Nascent Soul sat cross-legged with its eyes closed. Its facial features were eighty to ninety percent similar to Duan Renli.When Han Li saw this scene, his eyes couldn't help but narrow slightly.The Nascent Soul suddenly opened its eyes and opened its mouth. It spouted seven balls of blood essence in succession. At the same time, its hands made a gesture and an obscure incantation came out of its mouth.The blood essence transformed into seven bursts of blood mist that coiled around the Nascent Soul's limbs and neck like spirit snakes. Immediately thereafter, the Nascent Soul let loose a long cry, and the blood mist radiated crimson light, transforming it into a ball of crimson light.A strange scene appeared!The bloody light ball sank and merged into the skull of the skeleton.Suddenly, two balls of bloody light appeared in the hollow eyes of the huge skeleton. All the runes on its bones suddenly lit up.The huge waves in the blood red whirlpool below churned and flew out a viscous bloody light that converged together. It was like a huge spiral pillar of blood that soared into the sky, submerging the skeleton from the bottom to the top.Through the blood pillar, one could vaguely see that the tall figure inside was gradually expanding.The blood pillar fell down like a receding tide. The original huge skeleton disappeared without a trace, and was replaced by a terrifying ghost that was more than a thousand feet in size. It had a green face and fangs, a pair of huge curved horns on its head, a pair of blood-red eyes, and a body covered with blood-red hair. Its limbs were much longer than an ordinary person's, and there was a pair of purple-black bat wings on its back.As soon as it appeared, its body rippled with waves of astonishing fluctuations. Even the surrounding air trembled violently.\"This is the rumored Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost from the Netherworld?It's a little interesting! \"Han Li looked straight at the giant ghost in front of him and murmured.\"Chi La!\"The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost raised one of its arms, and a large bloody flame suddenly appeared in its palm. Then, it grabbed at Han Li from afar.The top of Han Li's head darkened. A huge bloody ghost claw appeared out of thin air. The ghost claw was wrapped in raging bloody flames, and it fiercely grabbed at him.Before the giant claw arrived, a gust of wind had already pressed down, causing the surrounding blood sea to surge violently.Han Li raised his hand and punched at the Void above him.\"Boom!\" Under the impact of an invisible force, the blood-red ghostly claw suddenly shattered, bursting into a sky full of bloody light and residual flames that splashed in all directions.His body also staggered a few steps back before he could stand firm. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.The power contained in the bloody giant claw was amazing, and somewhat beyond his expectations!However, the remnants of the crimson light didn't disappear. Instead, they abruptly stopped after flying a short distance, then intertwined to form a crimson ring with a diameter of several tens of feet. The crimson ring then abruptly contracted to bind Han Li tightly.Before Han Li could react, the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost waved one hand, and the bloody ring that trapped Han Li flew toward it at an incredible speed. It was caught by one of its bloody ghost claws, leaving only its head exposed.\"Let's see where you can run to!\" The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost grinned hideously, and its other ghost claw also clenched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost was surprised to see that his grip, which was powerful enough to uproot a mountain, had failed to crush Han Li.\"Hmph, you overestimate yourself!\"He grunted and thick blood tattoos appeared on the surface of his body. His arms suddenly thickened and he used all his strength to clench them again, pressing them down with an earth-shattering force.Apart from causing Han Li to show a hint of pain, his body was like an indestructible piece of fine iron. No matter how much strength he used, he couldn't break it.At this moment, a ball of golden light suddenly erupted from Han Li's body. Faint golden scales appeared on the surface of his body, and five balls of blue light flashed faintly from his chest and abdomen that were held by the ghostly claw.He let out a low shout and pushed out with both hands. A tremendous force that was several times stronger than before suddenly erupted.The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost was shocked. His fingers were slowly pushed away by Han Li.Han Li's body swayed, transforming into a golden blur as he flew out of the ghostly claw. Along the way, his body rapidly swelled in size, and thick golden fur quickly sprouted from all over his body, including his face. Two snowy white fangs emerged from his mouth.In the blink of an eye, he had turned into a giant golden ape that was more than 30 meters tall.A tyrannical aura exuded from him, and there was even some black fiendish aura that danced around his body.\"This is \u2026 the legendary Giant Mountain Ape!\" The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost was a little surprised.The giant ape that Han Li had turned into swayed and stood in the air more than 300 meters away. He suddenly beat his chest with both hands, feeling the majestic power surging through his body, and let out a long roar.Although his Nascent Soul was sealed, the power of the various true spirits and bloodlines that he had refined were still there. After his body had completely recovered, he could finally use the 12 Awakening Art.Using this divine ability once again made him feel a myriad of emotions in his heart.\"No wonder your divine power is so amazing. So it has something to do with this true spirit.If I can refine my Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost Streamer with your blood, it will definitely advance to the next level, and its power will greatly increase! \"The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost grinned, and its huge body pounced forward.He clenched his right claw into a fist, and the house-sized fist smashed toward the giant ape as a vast expanse of crimson light erupted from the fist.The giant golden ape snorted coldly and punched out as well. A large expanse of golden light erupted from his fist.Two fists of completely different sizes collided!An earth-shattering sound resounded throughout the entire sky, causing the sea of blood below to roil and surge as waves surged into the sky.The Crimson Blood Heavenly Ghost's body shuddered as it was sent flying. Its right arm exploded into a cloud of blood mist, revealing the translucent crimson bone within.Hualala!The Sky Ghost was smashed into the blood sea, setting off a monstrous wave of blood.The giant golden ape only swayed slightly before stabilizing its body and lowering its head to look down.After the sea surged for a while, it returned to calmness.But the next moment, there was a loud \"boom\"!The blood sea behind the giant ape suddenly burst open, and the surging waves of blood rolled out. The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost flew out of it, bathed in blood. Its previously exploded arm had already recovered to its original state, and its blood-red eyes shone brightly. It seemed as if the tyranny in its heart had been completely aroused.It grabbed the void with one of its arms, and a large expanse of blood below rolled up and condensed into a 300 to 400 feet long blood-red spear in its hand. Then, it swung its arm, and fiercely threw it at the giant golden ape in mid-air.There was suddenly an ear-piercing shriek in the void!The giant ape suddenly turned around, and instead of retreating, it swooped down. A hairy palm stretched out, and like a huge cattail leaf fan falling from the sky, it swatted at the blood-red spear.\"Bang!\" A loud noise resounded!Almost as soon as the blood-red spear was thrown, it was abruptly smashed away, and with a mournful wail, it exploded inch by inch, and turned into a mass of blood again.The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost could not help but be startled, and before it could dodge, the giant golden ape had rushed to less than a thousand feet in front of it, and two golden fists came down in a blur.The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost did not show weakness, and stretched out its left arm to block in the air.There was a loud noise!Its huge body was hit backward, and the flesh on the left side of its body was almost completely shattered, revealing its sparkling bones dripping with blood.Just as the giant golden ape expressionlessly roared, and was about to continue to chase, there was a sudden change in the blood sea below!The blood sea suddenly set off a huge wave, and as it twisted and deformed, it turned into a huge ferocious dragon head in the blink of an eye. Its bloody mouth opened and closed, and with lightning speed, it swallowed the giant ape not far from the surface of the sea.Then, the blood dragon rose from the sea with its fangs and claws bared, and impressively, it was more than a thousand feet long. Its huge body wriggled in the sky above the sea, and under the blood light, a blood mist billowed out.Not far away, the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost had already stabilized its body, and under the flashing of the runes on the surface of its bones, a viscous flow of blood flew out from the blood sea, and wrapped around the broken half of its body. Under the frantic squirming of the flesh, it was recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.Seeing that the giant ape was swallowed by the blood dragon, he quickly made a gesture with his hands, and a mysterious and obscure incantation came out of his mouth.The blood light in the giant dragon's eyes flourished, and its long body instantly coiled into a huge ball of blood. A dazzling blood light appeared on its surface, flashing incessantly, and its volume rapidly inflated as if it was inflated.A fierce look appeared on the face of the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost, and its hand gesture suddenly stopped, and at the same time, it spat out the word \"break\".But in the blink of an eye, there were countless golden threads on the surface of the huge blood ball, and a big bump suddenly bulged, followed by a loud \"bang\" sound, and a golden light flew out of it, rushing in the direction of the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost.Wrapped in the golden light, it was the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into.He had just flown less than two or three hundred feet, with an earth-shattering bang, the huge blood ball suddenly exploded, turning into a huge blood-colored halo, and in a flash, it became a thousand feet wide, and desperately spread in all directions.Circles of monstrous air waves spread out, and a strong wind swept over a dozen miles. The sea surface set off shocking waves, and at the center of the explosion, there were even ripples visible to the naked eye in the void, but it disappeared in the blink of an eye.Although the giant golden ape broke out of the body in time, it was still affected. The bright golden hair on its body was damaged in a few places, and it seemed to have suffered some minor injuries, but they were not serious.If it wasn't for its quick reaction, even with the strength of its body, it would inevitably be greatly injured.When the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost saw that the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into was rapidly approaching him, a pair of purple-black bat wings on its back flapped, and suddenly two hurricanes whistled under its body. Its huge body turned into a blurred blood shadow, and it quickly retreated into the distance, pulling away from the giant golden ape at a speed visible to the naked eye.The physical strength of the giant ape in front of him was far beyond his imagination, and he didn't want to face the other party head-on.Seeing this, the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into became gloomy.The Giant Mountain Ape was originally good at huge strength, but it was not good at speed, so it couldn't catch up with the other party at all.Suddenly, a strange howl came from the mouth of the Heavenly Ghost in the distance!\"Puff puff!\"The blood-colored sea around the giant ape protruded one after another, and then a number of blood shadows rushed out, densely packed, and there were hundreds of them, flocking toward the giant ape.It was a blood-colored ghost with a single horn on its head, a pair of green eyes, ten sharp fingers, and a blood mist lingering around its body.The giant ape's figure paused, and the golden light around its body shone brightly. Its huge body became blurred, and it quickly shrank, submerged in the surrounding blood mist.The next moment, a loud and clear sound rang out, and then thousands of dazzling green lights broke through the blood mist. Countless green gales appeared out of thin air, blowing the surrounding blood mist away again.Whoosh!A huge green shadow shot out like lightning. It was a giant green bird.It was seven or eight feet long, and its feathers were bright green. There was a green crown on its head, and its wings were wide. When spread out, it was a little longer than its body, and three long tail feathers trailed behind it, making it look very handsome.The gigantic green bird flapped its wings fiercely, and countless gusts of wind whistled out. Within the gusts of wind, hundreds of long green scars appeared, and they slashed at the Blood Ghosts that were pouncing towards it.Puchi!Immediately, dozens of blood ghosts were easily cut into several pieces by the green marks, bursting into a puff of blood mist.The giant green bird flapped its wings again, and suddenly turned into a blurred green shadow, rushing out of the rest of the blood ghosts with great dexterity, and shooting toward the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost.\"Holy Bird Blue Luan!Who are you? \"The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's expression changed greatly, and it turned around to escape with its wings.However, the green shadow was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it flew to the side of the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost.Puchi!A bloody light suddenly appeared on the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's chest, and three huge bone-deep wounds appeared, and blood splashed out.The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost suddenly turned around, and it was about to raise its arms to do something. Somehow, the green shadow appeared behind it, and flashed.Puchi!Three huge wounds appeared on the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's back, and one of its wings was cut off, and blood gushed out.\"Roar!\"The red light in the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's eyes brightened, and it suddenly turned to look at the green shadow. It let out an angry roar, and its ghostly claws clawed out.Countless crimson claw projections appeared, forming a dense net of crimson claws that blocked in front of him.As a result, the green shadow suddenly disappeared without a trace, and the next moment, as if it had teleported, it appeared on the right side of the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost, and once again pounced like lightning.Puchi!Three bone-deep wounds appeared on the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's right arm, and blood splashed out like a fountain.The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost roared again and again, and it tried to fight back.Unfortunately, it could not keep up with the green shadow's speed, and it could not even catch the shadow.A blurry green shadow flew around the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost like a ghost, and it could not be seen at all.In the blink of an eye, the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's body became a bloody mess, and its movements became sluggish.If it was not for the fact that the blood-red bones in its body were extremely hard, and the Blue Luan's attack could not break them, it would have been cut into countless pieces.A trace of fear finally flashed in the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost's eyes. It covered its head with its arms, and it flew toward the sea of blood below. At the same time, a huge viscous wave of blood rose from the sea of blood, and welcomed it.A loud and clear sound suddenly rang out!The green shadow's body swayed, and its speed increased again. It turned into a series of afterimages, and it quickly circled around the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Ghost.Rumble!A strong wind suddenly rose in the nearby sky, and countless long green scars appeared out of thin air, filling a radius of several miles, and crazily cutting everything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The streaks of green marks kept slashing its body, causing blood to splatter wildly.The Heavenly Ghost's hands waved wildly, but it was in vain. The flesh and blood on its body were shredded again and quickly blown away.Every time it wanted to use the power of the blood sea below to recover, it was always blocked.From the moment the Azure Luan appeared until now, only the time of a few breaths had passed from the beginning to the end, yet he'd already shockingly once again transformed into the appearance he had when he appeared from the sea of blood earlier, and only an incomparably enormous blood colored skeleton remained. Besides his head, there wasn't a shred of flesh on his body.As for the blood ghosts that rushed over like a swarm of bees in the distance, because they lost the support of spiritual power, they directly collapsed and disintegrated before they could fly to the skeleton.\"Damn it!\"The Heavenly Ghost skeleton roared, and the huge skeleton began to spin in mid-air, planning to desperately wait for an opportunity to swoop down.As a result, the phantasm transformed by the Green Luan spiraled faster and faster, and more and more green marks appeared in mid-air. Not only could the Heavenly Ghost not fall, but it was also faintly lifted up by the countless green marks into a gust of wind, flying high into the sky.\"Clang clang!\" A loud sound rang out!Streaks of green marks slashed on the scarlet skeleton one after another, making a dense sound like raindrops falling on banana leaves. It actually caused the blood light on the surface of the skeleton to faintly weaken.Following the slash of a thick green mark, a small crack finally appeared on the skeleton of Sky Ghost's forearm with a light \"Kacha\" sound.\"Stop, I admit defeat!\"The bloody light in the Heavenly Ghost skeleton's eyes shrank, and suddenly shouted.Upon hearing this, the azure silhouette that was rapidly circling around them stopped, and a giant azure bird appeared over 100 feet away. The bird folded its massive wings and stared at the Heavenly Ghost Skeleton with bright blue light shining from its eyes.Countless green marks suddenly dissipated, and the sky full of violent wind slowly stopped!Seeing this, the Heavenly Ghost skeleton let out a sigh of relief, and its body immediately flew toward the blood sea, and with a \"poof\" sound, it disappeared into the blood sea.After a moment, a black-robed figure flew out of it. It was Duan Renli.At this moment, his face was pale and haggard. It was obvious that he had used up a lot of Yuan Qi in the battle just now.Seeing this, the Green Luan's body flashed with a green light, and its huge body shrank quickly, revealing the figure of Han Li.The two of them looked at each other.Han Li had a smile on his face, but Duan Renli's expression was somewhat ugly.\u2026Inside Demon Flame Valley.In a corner of the valley, the purple-bearded man and the other three Body Integration cultivators were gathered. Liu Le'er was enveloped in silver flames as she stood at the other end of the valley.They all raised their heads to look at the sky.There was an enormous blood cloud that almost covered the entire sky above the gorge, and a huge blood banner was faintly discernible within it. It was bobbing up and down indeterminately, and from time to time, a breathtaking blood light would shoot out from it.Liu Le'er looked anxious and nervous.The violet bearded man and the others seemed to be rather relaxed, and they frequently swept their gazes towards the young girl with ill intent, causing her expression to become even more uneasy.As high-level cultivators in the sect, they were well aware of the power of this Crimson Blood Heavenly Ghost Banner.This treasure banner was passed down from one of the ancestors of the Tengui School who had ascended to the Immortal Realm, the Bone Flame Ancestor. The Heavenly Ghost sealed within it was said to be a ghost king that he had captured from the Land of the Netherworld. It was passed down from generation to generation to the First Supreme Elder, and was usually raised and worshipped with his own blood essence. During this period, it had undergone countless times of special blood essence refinement, and was no longer comparable to an ordinary Dharma treasure.Duan Renli's strength could only be considered average among the many Great Ascension Stage cultivators in the Spirit Huan Domain, but in the space of the blood banner, it was a completely different scene.Even though that Han Li was powerful and had an extremely tough body, the moment he was sucked into the space of the blood banner, the outcome was almost decided.\"It's been almost an hour.That Han Li has probably become the Heavenly Ghost's food by now. This little demon fox is really an eyesore, why don't we just kill her? \"The violet bearded man turned his head to look at Liu Le'er in the distance and said slowly.Not only did Han Li snatch one of his treasures, but he also caused him to make a fool of himself in front of Han Li. He knew that he couldn't get back at Han Li, so he naturally vented his anger on Liu Le'er.\"Elder Lu, don't be impatient. In my opinion, let's wait for Martial Uncle to come out and let him decide.\" The glamorous woman pondered for a moment and said so.\"Fairy Shi Mu is right.I just observed that the silver flame around this little demon fox is no small matter. It can even devour the Nine Heavens Demonic Flame. It seems to be some kind of mutated True Flame. Let's wait a little longer. \"The hunchbacked old man said thoughtfully.The one-eyed giant crossed his arms and stared at the huge blood cloud in mid-air with one eye, as if he didn't hear the few people's words.The violet bearded man's brows furrowed slightly upon seeing this, but he still nodded in response.The four of them hadn't unleashed any concealment techniques to conceal their voices, so Liu Le'er was naturally able to hear their conversation. Her petite body was trembling as she leaned against the rock wall, and her face was completely drained of all color.All of a sudden, the one-eyed giant spoke.\"Looks like there's a conclusion.\"As soon as this was said, everyone cast their eyes up into the air in unison.The massive crimson cloud tumbled violently before splitting in half, revealing the massive crimson flag within.The four Body Integration cultivators' expressions changed slightly upon seeing this.The crimson light emanating from the surface of the flag was still as dazzling as ever, but the giant ghostly head on the flag seemed to have dimmed slightly.Before anyone had a chance to think any further, light flashed from the crimson flag, and two streaks of light swept forth before landing on the ground down below.The light receded at the same time to reveal Han Li and Duan Renli, both of whom were appraising one another.Duan Renli stood expressionlessly with his hands clasped behind his back, appraising Han Li with a cold expression.As for Han Li, he wore a faint smile on his face and wore a calm expression.\"Big Brother!\"Liu Le'er faltered slightly upon hearing this, and tears immediately welled up in her eyes as she rushed toward Han Li with no regard for anything else.Perhaps it was due to the fact that she was overly concerned, or perhaps it was due to the fact that she had expended all of her magic power to begin with, but her footsteps were a little unsteady. When she reached Han Li, she tripped over something and was sent flying.Right at this moment, she felt as if she had been carried by a burst of invisible yet gentle force, following which her surroundings blurred, and she appeared beside Han Li.Han Li swept a sleeve through the air, and the silver net of flames enshrouding Liu Le'er contracted slightly before transforming back into a silver Fire Raven that disappeared into his body.The young girl opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but she suddenly realized that the surrounding atmosphere was a little strange. She immediately shut her mouth and stood obediently at the side.Seeing that Han Li, who should have been destroyed in both body and soul, was now standing in front of them, alive and well, with a calm and composed look on his face, the purple-bearded man and the other three stared with their mouths agape as they stood there in a daze.After a while, the few of them finally reacted. They looked at each other and wanted to ask what the result was, but they did not dare to.Right at this moment, Duan Renli slowly opened his mouth.\"Go and retrieve fifty kilograms of Yin Chen Stone.\"His tone was calm and his voice was not loud, but when it entered the ears of the purple-bearded man and the other three, it was as shocking as thunder.Although they had already guessed it, when they heard this, they still found it hard to believe.The meaning behind Duan Renli's words was very obvious. He had lost.One of the two great Grand Elders of the Tengui School, a Mahayana Stage cultivator who could summon wind and rain in the entire Spirit Huan Domain, had actually lost to this ordinary-looking, young Youth in front of him.Moreover, it was in the Crimson Blood Heavenly Ghost Flag's space of blood.\"Do you want me to repeat myself?\" Duan Renli's voice was still calm.\"Yes!\"The four of them were startled. The purple-bearded man and the beautiful woman hurriedly turned around and flew out of the canyon together.\"Fellow Duan is generous, it would be impolite for Han to refuse.\" Han Li's lips curled into a smile as he said slowly.\"You're very good.\" Duan Renli looked deeply into Han Li's eyes and said word by word.Then, he waved one hand and kept the giant blood-colored flag in the air. Then, he suddenly turned into a ray of black light and with a flash, he disappeared at the entrance of the canyon. Not a single trace of him could be seen.\u2026Not long after.Leng Yan Sect, in the main hall of the Chu Yun Peak.\"Although I had expected it, this person is not ordinary.But I didn't expect him to be so powerful that even Duan Renli from the Tengui School was not his match. \"Nangong Zhangshan sat on the main seat in the hall and said with a bitter smile.\"Fortunately, he is not our Leng Yan Sect's enemy.\" Luo Jun let out a long breath and said with a complicated expression.\"The theft of the Heavenly Talisman Hall and the Scripture Pavilion happened after this Elder Han came to our Chu Yun Peak. I think it was most likely his doing.But at that time, no matter what, it was impossible to suspect him. \"Nangong Zhangshan thought for a while and said.The rugged man nodded. It was obvious that he had already guessed this.However, he did not say much about this. Instead, he changed the topic and said,\"Although the Tengui School has kept their mouths shut about this matter, how could they hide such a huge commotion that day?Now, the entire Spirit Huan Domain is in an uproar because of this matter.It is said that many forces that were originally affiliated or close to the other two sects have the intention to join us. \"\"That's right. Valley Master Yu from the Abundant Valley and Mountain Master Zhao from the Wuwei Mountain have already sent their trusted aides to talk to the Sect Master in secret.Actually, these people also want to take the opportunity to see Elder Han personally. After confirming his strength, they will decide to join our Leng Yan Sect.Unfortunately, Elder Han went into seclusion not long after he returned.The First Supreme Elder also gave an order that no one is allowed to disturb him. \"Nangong Zhangshan said with a smile.Luo Jun nodded thoughtfully and did not say anything else.After a moment of silence in the hall, Nangong Zhangshan suddenly asked, \"Elder Luo, in your opinion, what do you think of this Elder Han?\"Luo Jun's expression changed slightly when he heard this. If it was in the past, he could naturally speak without thinking. But now, he did not dare to speak casually.After thinking for a while, he said with a serious expression, \"I have not had much contact with Elder Han.Previously, when Martial Nephew Gu brought him into the sect, other than confirming that he was a Strength Cultivator, I did not feel that there was anything special about him that was worth paying attention to.Now that I think about it carefully, I feel that he is even more meticulous and meticulous.However, this person is not a heartless person. \"\"Oh, why do you say so?\" Nangong Zhangshan raised his eyebrows and asked.\"Previously, didn't the Sect Master suggest for Elder Han to move to the cave abode that is adjacent to the First Supreme Elder's on the Sacred Fire Peak? However, he politely refused, saying that he is satisfied with the cave abode now and that there is no need to trouble himself.On the other hand, I feel that perhaps this is his intention. He wants to return a favor to our Chu Yun Peak. After all, with such an expert overseeing the sect, our peak's position in the sect will naturally rise greatly. \"Luo Jun explained.\"Indeed.Speaking of which, it was Martial Nephew Gu who recommended Elder Han into the sect. This can be considered a major contribution. In the future, we should double the amount of cultivation resources he receives every year. \"Nangong Zhangshan said in deep thought when he heard this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is a heaven-defying act to seek the path of immortals in one's limited life.Not only does it depend on one's aptitude, but it also depends on one's luck. This is why many people may not be able to reach the Foundation Establishment Stage in their lifetime, let alone the Golden Core Formation Stage.I have been cultivating for more than 500 years, and I have been in the Nascent Soul Stage for more than 100 years. There may be a glimmer of hope for me to reach the Deity Transformation Stage in the future, but it is extremely unlikely for me to reach the Void Refinement Stage.As for the Mahayana Stage that is only one step away from the path of immortals, I don't even dare to think about it. \"Gu Yunyue stopped and looked up at the sky.Hearing this, Yu Menghan's mind was a little excited, and a trace of sadness appeared in her eyes.The beautiful woman looked back at the girl in the palace dress and shook her head with a smile.\"Master is limited by her aptitude. If there is no special opportunity, her achievements will most likely be so.Menghan, on the other hand, you have a spirit body and an extremely high comprehension ability. In just two years, you have already reached the Foundation Establishment Stage. If there is no accident, your future achievements will definitely be higher than me. It is not impossible for you to reach the Void Refinement Stage. \"\"Thanks to master's careful teaching and many precious pills, Menghan is very grateful.\" Yu Menghan said sincerely.\"Thanks to Elder Han, you don't need to worry about the problem of pills for a long time.\" Gu Yunyue waved her hand and continued.Yu Menghan's eyes lit up.\"Speaking of which, master has visited elder Han once in the past two years. However, his dwelling has already been designated as a forbidden ground within the sect, so it'll probably be impossible for me to visit him again in the future.\" Gu Yunyue sighed as she finished speaking. Some regret appeared on her face.\u2026Not long after, the Leng Yan Sect suddenly accepted a rogue cultivator as an outer sect disciple on the Chuyun Peak. His aptitude was mediocre and he was not young, but he was only in the Core Formation stage. He did not meet the recruitment requirements at all, so it caused quite a stir among the disciples.It wasn't until later that everyone learned that the man's name was White Stone, and that he was an old friend of Elder Han's that the matter gradually died down. More and more people, including elders whose cultivation bases far surpassed his, began to express goodwill toward him.Of course, this was a story for another time.Another month passed quickly.At the back of the Sky-admiring Peak, the main peak of the Realm Taoist Temple, there was a jade-like oval-shaped pool. The spiritual energy in the pool was rich, and a layer of thick white mist floated on the surface of the water. From time to time, golden fat carps leaped out of the water.On the rocks and grass beside the pool, there were more than a dozen red-crowned cranes playing with each other, pecking at the scattered spirit grass on the ground. They would raise their heads and chirp a few times from time to time.\"Whoosh!\"A purple escape light suddenly flashed from the sky and landed beside the pool.The light faded, revealing a tall man wearing a golden crown and a purple robe with golden patterns. He looked like he was in his forties or fifties. He had three strands of long black beard on his face, which made him look like an immortal.As soon as he landed, he looked at the cranes beside him, then he moved his gaze to the other side of the pool, at the green and black stone wall covered with moss.He flipped his hand in his sleeve, and a voice transmission talisman shot out of his sleeve with a \"whoosh\", flying into the stone wall and disappearing.After a while, a pale golden light curtain appeared on the stone wall, revealing a hole that was as tall as a person.The purple-robed taoist didn't hesitate, and his figure flashed and flew into the hole.Inside the stone wall, there was a very wide stone room.There were three levels of high platforms in the middle of the room, and each level was engraved with mysterious patterns. There were also strange yellow lamps placed densely on top of the platforms, forming a strange formation, from which waves of amazing spiritual power were emitted.In the middle of the high platform, a fat man wearing a golden robe with his chest exposed sat on a futon. From afar, he looked like a small mountain of meat.\"Grand Elder, today, the Leng Yan Sect sent a message, saying that Elder Han wants to use the Condensing Star Stage in our temple for cultivation, and he promised a generous reward.Should we \u2026 \"The purple-robed taoist bowed to the\" mountain of meat \"and said respectfully.The fat on the golden-robed man's face trembled, and he didn't answer. Instead, he said slowly, \"I asked you to arrange to investigate this person's identity, how is it going?\"His voice was abnormally loud, and it echoed in the stone room.\"We only know that this person suddenly appeared in Toyokuni two years ago, and then he entered the Leng Yan Sect and became an outer elder. However, he was quite low-key during that period, and there was nothing unusual about him. As a result, our spy in the Leng Yan Sect didn't know about this person until after the incident at the Tengui School,\" the purple-robed taoist replied.\"Forget it. If I were Sima Jingming, that old fox, I would definitely block the information about this person.What's the situation at the Tengui School recently? \"The golden-robed man asked again.\"After the incident, the disciples of the Tengui School became very low-key, and they didn't show any dissatisfaction or desire for revenge,\" the purple-robed taoist said after thinking for a while.\"Do you think I don't know the temperament of those two old farts?They are vengeful people, and they won't just swallow their anger. Let's just wait and see. \"The golden-robed man sneered, and it was obvious that he didn't believe it.\"Then about borrowing the Condensing Star Stage \u2026\" The purple-robed taoist asked hesitantly.\"Since the other party has the strength of the Mahayana Stage, it's naturally inconvenient to become enemies with him. For the time being, let's agree to it,\" the golden-robed man said after a moment of silence.The purple-robed taoist frowned, and after a moment of hesitation, he said:\"I won't hide it from First Elder, the few Grand Elders in the temple are somewhat worried about this. They're afraid that after this person enters the Star Condensation Platform to cultivate, his strength will rise another level. At that time, our Realm Temple will be suppressed by the Cold Flame Sect.In addition, the Condensing Star Stage consumes a lot of Star Stone, and we have to use it to cultivate the elite disciples in the temple. If we waste it on an outsider, it will be a pity \u2026 \"\"What a joke. How can it be so easy to improve one's strength after reaching the Mahayana Stage?However, since he wants to use it, the consumption naturally can't be borne by us. All of it will be compensated by the Leng Yan Sect, \"the golden-robed man said with a faint smile.\"Yes!\" The purple-robed taoist respectfully replied.\u2026Two months later, in the Realm Temple.Among the rolling green mountains, there were thousands of peaks competing with each other, drifting clouds. From time to time, there were red-crowned cranes flying in the sky, showing the momentum of a fairyland.In the middle of the peaks, there was a towering giant peak that towered into the clouds, far surpassing the surrounding peaks.On top of the peak, there were huge stones stacked one after another, filled with Spirit Qi, but there were not too many vegetation covering it. In the middle, there was a nine-story high platform shaped like a round tower. Its whole body was lustrous white, as if it was carved out of beautiful jade.Around the high platform, there was a brown-robed old man with his eyes closed, sitting cross-legged.Near dusk, the afterglow of the setting sun shone down, directly illuminating the rocks on the top of the mountain, emitting a soft orange light, reflected on the white jade high platform, refracting a strange glow that enchanted people's hearts.At this time, in the distant sky, suddenly, two rainbow lights galloped together and landed under the white jade high platform, revealing two figures, one fat and one thin.The brown-robed old men who were originally sitting around the high platform got up one after another, came to the side of the two, and bowed respectfully to the fat golden-robed man, saying in unison:\"We pay our respects to the Grand Elder.\"With that said, their gazes shifted slightly, looking up and down at the unfamiliar Youth beside the golden-robed man.This person was tall and had an ordinary appearance. Naturally, he was Han Li, who had come to borrow the Star Condensation Platform.The golden-robed man waved his large hand, not saying anything.The four immediately understood, and without another word, they retreated, returning to their original positions.The golden-robed man's voice was loud, and he said with a smile, \"Friend Han, the four of them are the guardians of the Star Condensation Platform. Although there is only one Body Integration cultivator and the other three are Spatial Tempering cultivators, they have cooperated with each other for many years, and their hearts are linked. With them protecting you, there will be no danger.\"Han Li naturally didn't want to have the people of the Dao Temple protecting him, but he also knew that this was something he couldn't refuse. The smile on his face didn't fade, and he said, \"Thank you, Fellow Daoist He Shan.\"The golden-robed man looked up at the sky, and said, \"Night is approaching, so I won't delay Friend Han's cultivation.If you need anything else, feel free to ask those people, \"the golden-robed man said as he looked up at the sky.With that said, he cupped his hands toward Han Li, and turned into a streak of light, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.After watching him leave, Han Li looked around, and turned to the stairs of the Star Condensation Platform, but he wasn't in a hurry to climb it.The people around the platform were already quickly forming hand seals, and chants could be heard from their mouths.Then, mysterious runes lit up beneath the four of them, and a golden barrier of light that covered the entire Star Condensation Platform appeared out of thin air.At the same time, a narrow entrance that was as tall as a person appeared in front of Han Li.Blue light flashed through his eyes, and he found that although the spiritual power fluctuations in the light barrier weren't weak, it was only a defensive spell formation. He took a large step forward, and walked in.As soon as Han Li entered, the entrance to the light barrier closed, fusing with the air, and disappeared.As soon as he stepped onto the stairs, a strange spiritual power fluctuation immediately came from all directions.Han Li's heart was slightly surprised, and he looked around.He saw that the stone steps under his feet, and the surrounding ground, were densely covered with small potholes. If he didn't look carefully, he wouldn't have noticed them.He used his Spirit Eye to look for a moment, and found that there was a faint silver light flickering at the bottom of the potholes. They were actually traces left behind by being bathed in the power of the stars for many years.On the ground of the Star Condensation Platform, there were many patterns that were connected by circles and lines. Some were connected by three to five, and were extremely simple. Some were connected by more than ten, and their shapes were complicated. There were also some that were connected to form the word \"Jing\" \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li walked up the stone steps, all the way to the top of the Star Condensation Platform. Only then, near the center of the platform, did he find a map of the Big Dipper.After examining it for a moment, he sat down cross-legged, raising his head to look at the sky. He discovered that the sky had already turned a deep blue, and a few sparse specks of starlight had already faintly appeared in the sky.He slowly closed his eyes, and began to breathe in and out quietly.About two hours later.Han Li's eyelids slightly moved, and his eyes once again opened. His lips slightly parted, and he spat out two words.\"Begin!\"Hearing this, the four brown-robed elders around the high platform each took out a palm-sized milky white Star Stone, and pressed it into a groove in the ground in front of them.There was a soft \"ka\" sound.The four round stones shattered at the same time, and rays of white light began to shine from within the grooves. They flowed along the formation engravings on the ground, and very quickly rushed into the Star Condensation Platform.The entire nine level high platform immediately shone with light, becoming translucent and sparkling. The star maps engraved on it exploded with a resplendent silver light, and from afar, it seemed like a miniature starry sky, extremely gorgeous.And at this moment, the stars that filled the sky seemed to resonate with the scene here, growing even brighter. Countless fragments of silver light sprinkled down from the curtain of night, like a faint silver mist, enveloping the Star Condensation Arena.Han Li was in the middle of it, as if he was sitting cross-legged in the middle of a sky full of stars. He only felt a boundless and gentle power of the stars encircling him.He focused his mind, formed a seal with his hands, and began to chant in a low voice, silently activating the [Little Big Dipper Origin Technique].\"Boom!\" A muffled sound was heard.Six pillars of white light, each as thick as a water tank, suddenly descended from the night sky, projecting around Han Li. The power of the stars within was incomparably abundant, emitting waves of surging fluctuations.Countless sparkling and translucent threads of light drifted out from the pillars of light, and suddenly stretched taut. Like countless steel needles, they pierced towards Han Li's body.At the same time, the faint silver mist that enveloped the entire Star Condensation Platform seemed to be suddenly stimulated by something, and began to rapidly flow.Countless fragments of silver light, under a great force, instantly gathered above the Star Condensation Arena, forming a silver whirlpool of light that was thirty meters tall.Han Li's heart skipped a beat. Just now, the extremely gentle power of the stars had suddenly become incomparably violent.After the six pillars of light were enveloped by the vortex, they immediately shone brightly and expanded in size by several times. The power of the stars that poured into them also increased by several times.On the other hand, the pain that Han Li was suffering right now was not something that could be compared to at the beginning.His clothes were instantly soaked in blood. A huge amount of Star Crystal Threads kept piercing through his skin, and the blood that oozed out was drawn by the power of the silver vortex, turning into a hazy mist of blood that enveloped his entire body.The four brown-robed elders surrounding the Star Condensation Arena were all greatly shaken at this moment. In the long years that they had been guarding this place, when had they ever seen such a berserk star energy, and when had they ever seen such a crude method of imbuing one's body?At this moment, even if a Body Integration cultivator were to enter the Star Condensation Arena, they would most likely struggle to survive.However, at this moment, the blood-soaked Han Li's waist suddenly lit up with a ball of light. Six black round mirrors the size of a palm flew out, flying towards the six surrounding pillars of light.The round mirrors were shrouded in black Qi and had a simple and unadorned style. On the surface of the mirror, there were faintly floating talisman characters. These were the Star Moon Treasured Mirrors that he had refined using the Yin Chen Stones that he had obtained from the Tengui School.As soon as the six treasured mirrors landed, black light flowed on the surface of the mirrors. Strange talisman characters the size of ants surged out, converging into an incomparably thick and resplendent pillar of light that shot straight into the night sky.\"It actually wants to increase the power of the stars. This is truly inconceivable!\" The brown-robed elder was greatly astonished and muttered to himself.Before his voice had faded, the light of the six stars of the Big Dipper suddenly surged, and a bright silver light suddenly appeared in the air. Like the Milky Way, it violently flowed into the silver vortex.\u2026 \u2026Half a year later, in a stone room at the back of Reverence Heaven Peak.The golden-robed Taoist He Shan sat cross-legged on the three-story high platform with his eyes closed. He formed a hand sign and muttered.Suddenly, the hand sign in his hand stopped and he hurriedly stood up.A gust of strange wind appeared in the room out of nowhere. Wherever it passed, the dozens of yellow lamps on the high platform lit up one after another. Wisps of white smoke rose in spirals and gathered into a white mist in the air.The surface of the mist blurred, and the figure of an old man with gray hair and a purple lotus crown appeared. He was not tall and had a thin figure. He wore an ochre yellow Taoist robe embroidered with gold.When Taoist He Shan saw this, the fat on his body trembled as he knelt on the ground and said respectfully, \"Welcome, Clarity Ancestor.\"\"Rise.I have come today because I have a few things for you to do, \"Purple Crown I said with a wave of his sleeve.\"Please instruct me, Ancestor.\" Taoist He Shan stood up and stood with his hands clasped.\"The quality of the Vast Origin Stone you offered last time is not bad. You need to collect another batch within ten years,\" Purple Crown I ordered.\"Yes.\"\"This is the Orion Star Transference Mysterious Art that I created back then. Now that my state of mind is different, I have made some improvements to the art. Take it and place it in the Scripture Pavilion \u2026\"Purple Crown I's lips kept opening and closing as he gave several important orders. Taoist He Shan agreed to each of them without hesitation.At the end, I said,\"Also, there is another important matter that you need to do carefully.\"When Taoist He Shan heard this, he looked at I with a solemn expression and quietly waited for the other's next orders.The latter waved his sleeve and the light screen immediately trembled. A foot-long golden leaf passed through the light screen and floated in front of him.\"If there is news of this person, immediately report back,\" Purple Crown I said with an unquestionable tone.Taoist He Shan received the golden leaf with both hands and looked at it with rapt attention. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.The golden leaf had the image of a Youth drawn on it. The appearance was none other than Han Li.\"What, is there something wrong?\" Purple Crown I asked indifferently.\"Reporting to Ancestor, this person \u2026 this person is currently in our temple,\" Taoist He Shan hurriedly replied.\"Are you sure it is this person?\" Purple Crown I's expression did not change, but the speed of his words faintly increased.\"Although the figure of the person in the painting is much thinner, his expression and appearance are completely the same. There is no mistake, it is him.\" Taoist He Shan said with certainty after a moment of silence.\"Why is this person in my Realm Temple?\" Purple Crown I nodded slightly and asked again.\"Ancestor, please forgive me. This person is actually a Leng Yan Sect \u2026\" Taoist He Shan first apologized, then explained everything he knew about Han Li in detail.After Purple Crown I finished listening, he revealed a look of contemplation and did not speak for a long time.Taoist He Shan's forehead was slightly sweaty, but he did not dare to make a sound and could only wait quietly.\"This person has a great background, most likely a banished immortal from the Immortal World. Now there is a high bounty on his head in the Immortal World.Do not act rashly and alert him. Wait for my follow-up arrangements.Before that, no matter what, you must make him stay in my Realm Temple, \"Purple Crown I said with a stern expression.\"Understood,\" Taoist He Shan immediately responded.\u2026In an unknown sea in the Immortal World.The seawater here was a strange pitch-black color, like ink.The black sea was boundless, the waves surged violently, extending to the end of one's vision.In the sky above the black sea, nearly a hundred black mountain peaks floated, and on top of them stood huge black octagonal towers.Although these towers were both tall and short, the tallest being ten thousand feet and the shortest only a thousand feet, without exception, they all looked exactly the same. They were pitch-black and had octagonal flying eaves.In a hall at the top of a small black tower, a person wearing a purple crown, I sat cross-legged in front of a square altar. It was the Clear Light Spiritual Master.A white formation floated above the altar, emitting a bright white light.I waved his hand and struck out a technique. The white formation immediately stopped operating, and the white light quickly dimmed.Then, he looked forward without moving, but his eyes were constantly flickering, as if he was hesitating about something.After a long time, I gritted his teeth, as if he had made a decision. He flipped his hand and took out a crystal bead the size of a thumb. It was sparkling and translucent, and he tossed it in front of him.As a technique entered the bead, many mosquito sized crystal runes immediately appeared on the surface of the bead. They condensed into a foot-long formation that rotated gently.Every time a breath passed, the formation would fluctuate.Time passed bit by bit, and after a quarter of an hour, there were no changes to the formation.There was no impatience on I's face as he waited calmly.After another quarter of an hour, the formation suddenly lit up, and a small pitch-black shadow appeared inside. It was a man in a black robe. He had a wide forehead and a wide face, but his body was like a dead tree. His complexion was waxy yellow, and he looked like he was terminally ill.\"Bone Flame Sanren, I haven't seen you for a thousand years. You look as elegant as ever.\" Spiritual Master Clarity cupped his fists, and a warm smile appeared on his face.\"Spiritual Master Clarity I, if you have something to say, make it short.\" Bone Flame Sanren did not have a friendly expression when facing I, and he looked slightly impatient.\"I wonder if you are in Black Water City now?This Penniless Daoist has a great opportunity here. \"Dao Master Clarity withdrew his smile and spoke in a mysterious manner.\"Tell me about it.\" Bone Flame Sanren's expression did not change, and he said lightly.\"I believe you have received the Ten Directions Tower's wanted order, right?\" Spiritual Master Clarity said slowly.\"What do you mean?Could it be that you have news of the person on the wanted order? \"Bone Flame Sanren raised his eyebrows slightly.\"That's right, that person is currently in the Spirit Huan World!\" Spiritual Master Clarity's eyes flashed, and he said something shocking.\"Is this true?\" Bone Flame Sanren's expression changed slightly, and he confirmed it with caution.\"Whether it's true or not, you only need to contact the disciples in the lower realm, and you will know very soon.\" Spiritual Master Clarity touched his chin, and said while shaking his head.\"Listening to you, could it be that you want to \u2026\" Bone Flame Sanren's eyes lit up slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if he's restricted by the power of realms in the lower realms, he's definitely not someone that two or three Grand Ascension Stage beings can handle,\" Loose Bone said in a calm manner.\"There's no need to worry about that, Fellow Daoist. According to the information I've gathered, this man has been severely wounded, and his powers have been severely diminished. At most, he's only slightly more powerful than the average Grand Ascension cultivator,\" Spiritual Master Clarity replied.\"It's still too risky to let a sect from the lower realm deal with an Immortal. Why don't we wait for this person to leave the Spirit Huan World, and let the few of us deal with him ourselves?\" The Boneflame Immortal said after a moment of silence.\"I think that this matter should be settled early. If we delay, there will be changes.For the Ten Directions Tower to offer such a high bounty, it means that this person must have some big secret on him. Even if he doesn't, the bounty is enough for us to fight for it, \"Reverend Clarity said slowly, his words filled with endless temptation.Flame Bone was silent. His eyes flashed as if he was moved by Clarity Enlightened Master's words.After a while, he slowly opened his mouth and said, \"Alright, I'll remember this.If everything is really as you say, then our two sects will join hands and support this great undertaking.As for the specifics, we'll discuss it after I return to Blackwater City. \"\"Brother Yan is wise,\" said Reverend Clarity with a smile.\u2026Several days later, in a great hall in the depths of the Realm Temple in the Spirit Huan World.There was nothing in the hall except for a white jade platform in the center of the hall. On top of this platform, there was a teleportation formation that was more than a hundred feet in size. It was buzzing, emitting a dazzling white light.Daoist He Shan was currently standing in front of the spirit formation, looking at it expressionlessly as if he was waiting for something.Moments later, the white light radiating from the teleportation formation fluctuated, and rings of runes emerged from within. They danced up and down, releasing dazzling light.Within the light, two figures, one tall and one short, appeared. After the light faded, their true appearances were revealed.The shorter one was a bald old man in a black robe. His hands were clasped behind his back and he was slightly hunched. He was not even as tall as the other person's shoulder. His face was as dark as pig iron, and his whole body exuded an indescribable cold aura.The other person was a middle-aged man who wore a black robe and had a refined appearance. It was Duan Renli.\"Fellow Daoist Tong and Fellow Daoist Duan, our Realm Temple is honored by your presence.We haven't seen each other for so many years, the two of you are still as graceful as before. Especially Fellow Tong, your cultivation seems to have risen greatly. It's truly a matter worthy of celebration! \"Daoist He Shan cupped his hands towards the two of them and said with a smile.The bald old man was the other Mahayana Stage cultivator in the Tengui School, Tong Renjue. Not only was he the person with the highest cultivation in the Tengui School, he could also be called the number one cultivator in the entire Spirit Huan Domain.However, this person was eccentric and didn't stay in the sect all year round. No one knew where he usually cultivated in seclusion.The old man only nodded slightly at Taoist He Shan as a form of greeting.\"Fellow Daoist He Shan, it's been a long time.\" Duan Renli returned Daoist He Shan's greeting with a faint smile.\"Fellow Daoists, this is not the place to talk, please move to the side hall.\" Daoist He Shan chuckled and made an inviting gesture before leading the way.A moment later, the three of them arrived at a side hall and sat down according to the host and guest.\"Fellow Daoist He Shan, where is that Han Li now?\" Tong Renjue went straight to the point as soon as he sat down.His voice was hoarse and piercing like metal pieces rubbing against each other, as if he hadn't spoken to anyone for a long time.\"To tell you the truth, this True Immortal Han is currently in our sect's Condensing Star Stage.Ever since he entered, he hasn't left a single step. It's already been half a year. \"Daoist He Shan said frankly.\"He's a mighty True Immortal. He must have a reason for wanting to borrow the Condensing Star Stage. Does Fellow Daoist He Shan know the details?\" Duan Renli's expression changed as he asked cautiously.\"I've thought about this as well. I've watched him from afar several times in the middle of the night and even had a Body Integration cultivator of our sect stand guard by his side day and night in the name of a protector.Judging from the situation of his cultivation and the astronomical phenomenon he caused, he should be cultivating some kind of special body refinement technique that requires the power of the stars. \"Daoist He Shan pondered for a moment before saying so.\"This person's body is already unbelievably powerful, and he can use some kind of strange secret technique to transform into a True Spirit Giant Mountain Ape and an Azure Luan.Could it be that he's a Profound Immortal who fled to a lower realm? \"Duan Renli guessed with a hint of realization.\"Perhaps.According to the Clarity Patriarch, this person has already lost his immortal body due to his severe injuries. Now that he's in this realm, his strength will be greatly restricted, so he can only be considered a Half Immortal. \"Daoist He Shan nodded in a noncommittal manner.\"Even if he's a Half Immortal, he's definitely not an ordinary Grand Ascension Stage cultivator. It's always good to be cautious,\" Tong Renjue said in a solemn voice.\"Fellow Daoist Tong is right. This matter is very unusual and has great implications. We must come up with a foolproof plan. This is also the reason why I invited the two of you here today.\" Daoist He Shan nodded with a solemn expression upon hearing this.\"This is Fellow Daoist He Shan's territory after all. I'm sure you've already considered this matter. I'd like to hear your opinion.\" Tong Renjue looked at Daoist He Shan in a meaningful manner.\"Hehe, you're being too polite, Fellow Daoist Tong.I do have some humble opinions, but I still need to discuss them with the two of you. \"Daoist He Shan chuckled.\u2026 \u2026Late at night.Not a sound could be heard in the Realm Temple. All of the pavilions were shrouded in a layer of hazy darkness. Only the peak of Nine Palace Mountain was brightly lit, as if it was daytime.Six incomparably thick pillars of light hung down from the starry sky. As the white light flashed, it seemed to be gradually fading away, turning into specks of silver light that dissipated.The entire Star Condensation Platform was filled with smoke-like silver light fragments.On the ground of the platform, Han Li sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. His entire body was translucent, and there was a shimmering silver light flowing on the surface of his skin. The well-defined muscles all over his body emitted a faint silver metallic luster. Every muscle seemed to have become as tough as fine gold.On his chest and abdomen, there were six spoon-shaped blue dots of light arranged in a row. They flickered incessantly and were abnormally eye-catching.Right at this moment, six streaks of black light flew out from the six pillars of light that were about to completely collapse. The streaks of black light then transformed into six palm-sized antiquated black mirrors that flew into his body and disappeared without a trace.After a long while, Han Li slowly opened his eyes and let out a long breath.With the support of the two strange treasures, the Star Condensation Platform and the Star Moon Treasured Mirror, the sixth level of the Little Big Dipper Star Yuan Art had finally been completed.\"Just one more step.\"Han Li muttered to himself. He then stood up and took a step forward.There was a loud \"boom\".The entire Star Condensation Platform shook. His body could not help but stagger. He had actually stomped a hole in the stone platform, and half of his calf was embedded in it.When Han Li saw this, he did not know whether to laugh or cry. He did not think that after completing the sixth level of the cultivation technique, there would be such an obvious change in his body.Just now, he had not controlled the strength of his stomp well. It was not intentional, but it already had such astonishing destructive power.Fortunately, the place he had stomped on had no engravings of a star atlas formation, so it would not affect the use of the Star Condensation Platform. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain.Thinking of this, he could not help but reach out and touch his nose.After the several elders around the high platform felt the violent vibration, they were all startled. Then the other three looked at the brown-robed, white-bearded old man.\"It's nothing, don't worry about it.\"The white-bearded old man only glanced up slightly, then his lips moved slightly and transmitted his voice to the other three.Ever since Han Li came here to cultivate, he had almost become accustomed to the behavior of this high-grade strength cultivator, whose strength was comparable to a Mahayana cultivator. What could a cultivator who could remain calm under the shroud of such a vast power of stars not be able to do?And the order given to him by the Great Elder was to closely monitor this person's movements and try not to contact him as much as possible.On the Star Condensation Platform, Han Li took a deep breath and flipped his wrist, taking out a grey shield that was two feet in length.This shield was also a defensive treasure that he had casually put away during the battle at the Tengui School. It seemed to have been obtained from an unlucky Spatial Tempering cultivator. The entire shield was forged from Flowing Light Iron, and there were also some refined crystals mixed in. There were many mysterious runes engraved on the surface of the shield, and there were faint streams of light sliding on the surface of the shield.He injected a little magic power into the shield, causing the surface of the shield to flash with spiritual light, and after all the reinforcement restrictions were activated, he held the two ends of the shield with both hands and exerted a little force.With a \"pu\" sound, the spiritual light on the surface of the shield dimmed, following which a series of clanging sounds rang out. The entire black shield was immediately twisted and deformed, like a clay statue, being crushed into a ball.Seeing this, Han Li was overjoyed.According to his estimation, his current strength and physical strength had almost doubled compared to before.He raised his head to look at the bright stars in the sky, and his mood gradually calmed down. He once again sat on the Big Dipper Star Atlas, closing his eyes and adjusting his breathing.Approximately two hours later.Han Li's hands formed a hand seal, and his mouth began to chant the chant for the seventh layer of the Little Big Dipper Origin Art.The Big Dipper Star in the depths of the sky suddenly brightened, emitting a bluish-silver light that was different from the surrounding stars. Moreover, it violently flickered between bright and dark.This time, there were a total of seven incomparably thick silver pillars of light that abruptly fell from the sky, bombarding the Star Condensation Platform.All of the star atlases engraved on the platform simultaneously shined with silver light, illuminating the entire area.From a distance, the entire platform seemed to have been molded with silver liquid.Only a loud rumble could be heard.The entire Nine Palace Mountain suddenly trembled, and a large expanse of silver light swept out. A silver vortex of light that was ten times more powerful than the previous one swept out, madly revolving above the platform.The layer of protective light that originally enveloped the Star Condensation Platform was drawn into the incomparably violent power of the stars. Immediately, it was torn into pieces, turning into specks of golden light that disappeared without a trace.The four elders guarding the platform were caught off guard, and were swept by the aftermath of the vortex. Among them, three Void Tempering Stage elders could not help but be sent flying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were Daoist He Shan, Tong Renjue, and Duan Renli.At this moment, without exception, they were all looking at the dazzling white light that shot into the sky in the boundless night.That was the direction of Nine Palace Mountain.The three of them were silent. Aside from the mountain wind that blew the corners of their clothes, the surroundings were silent. The atmosphere was somewhat heavy.After a while, the silence was broken by one of them.\"Fellow Daoist He Shan, could this be your so-called foolproof plan?You want this person to cultivate in peace and greatly increase his strength? \"Duan Renli slowly said.\"I didn't think it through.It seems that this person has found some kind of method to recover from his injuries. \"Daoist He Shan sighed and said with some helplessness.\"This matter cannot be delayed any longer.\" Tong Renjue said coldly.\"Fellow Daoist Tong is right.Originally, the preparations were almost complete. There were some details that I wanted to carefully study, but now, we really can't wait any longer. \"Daoist He Shan's voice sank.\"We should have done it long ago.\" Duan Renli muttered and clenched his fists in his sleeves. His eyes lit up with a hint of eagerness.\u2026 \u2026The next morning.In the back mountain of the Leng Yan Sect's Sacred Fire Peak, a small courtyard with green tiles was hidden in the Purple Bamboo Forest.Sima Jingming stood in front of a red sandalwood table with his hands by his side. He looked at a three foot portrait on the wall and was respectfully reporting something.At this moment, light flowed on the portrait and a figure suddenly appeared. It floated in the air with a square face and bright eyes. It was the Icy Flame Ancestor.\"You're saying that this Han Li has already begun to cultivate the seventh layer?\" The Icy Flame Ancestor coughed lightly and slowly asked.\"From the description of the Heaven and Earth Anomaly last night, it is most likely correct.Ancestor, what is this person's identity? His cultivation speed is truly unimaginable \u2026 \"Sima Jingming first said with certainty, but then he hesitated to speak further.\"Hehe, I don't know his identity, but I just found out recently that an enormous organization in the Immortal Dimension has placed a bounty on the head of this Friend Han, and the bounty is so generous that even I'm slightly tempted.Bright Clarity I, who had been in seclusion all year round, had recently left for Old Ghost Yan's Black Water City.In my opinion, the Tengui School and the Realm Origin Temple are about to get restless, \"the Icy Flame Ancestor said unhurriedly.\"Then should we \u2026\" Sima Jingming was startled and asked with a strange expression.\"Do you want to join the plan of those two sects and get a share of the loot?\" Cold Flame Ancestor interrupted him.Sima Jingming knew that he had said something inappropriate and quickly shut his mouth.\"Fellow Daoist Han, Daoist Clarity and Old Ghost Yan haven't personally interacted with each other, but I have.This person was definitely not simple!When I heard you say that he has already mastered the sixth layer of the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique, I was even more convinced of this point.Even if the benefits are tempting, you still need to be alive to enjoy them, \"the Icy Flame Ancestor said with deep meaning.\"Jingming understands,\" Sima Jingming hurriedly replied.\u2026 \u2026Late at night, at the top of the Star Condensation Platform.Han Li sat cross-legged, his entire body bathed in the center of the silver vortex formed by the seven silver pillars of light.At the same time, the vast power of the stars surged into his body from all directions, tempering his body.His body was motionless, but his mind was multitasking as he pondered something.The heavenly omens caused by the cultivation of the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique were quite astonishing. Under the violent power of the stars, the defensive restrictions that originally enveloped the Star Condensation Platform collapsed.After the four Realm Origin Temple elders were sent flying, they never appeared again. As for Daoist He Shan, he didn't seem to care about this at all, as if he was too confident in him.This originally didn't matter, but recently, he could clearly sense that the Realm Origin Temple cultivators within a two hundred kilometer radius of the Star Condensation Platform didn't seem to return after leaving their cave dwellings.At first, he didn't think much of it. After all, it was common for people from the sect to travel or carry out missions and not return for a long time. But after this situation continued for half a month, it finally gradually attracted his attention, and he couldn't help but become more vigilant.Just now, he didn't know why, but he faintly felt a little uneasy. A feeling of unease welled up in his heart.Han Li muttered to himself for a moment, then withdrew a portion of his spiritual sense that was drawing in the power of the stars, and quickly searched everything within a radius of several hundred kilometers.At this moment, the entire space above him suddenly blurred, then an incomparably thick white mark silently appeared. It was as if the entire sky had been forcibly torn in half, extremely strange.Chi chi chi!Countless silver runes surged out of the white mark in a frenzy, as if there were no end to them. As soon as all of the runes appeared, they transformed into balls of silver light that exploded, dyeing the entire space in a silvery-white color.As these silver halos fused with each other, an incomparably huge silver moon condensed. It was extremely large and gave off a dazzling brilliance, causing all the surrounding stars to pale in comparison.All of this took a long time to describe, but it actually happened in an instant. The instant the giant silver moon formed, all the starlight that fell from the sky also disappeared.Seeing this, Han Li's figure blurred without saying anything. In the blink of an eye, he left the range of Nine Palace Mountain, and with a few flashes, he had flown twenty to thirty kilometers away.Just at this moment, something strange happened again!On a mountain several dozen kilometers away from Nine Palace Mountain, a huge boulder tumbled down with a resounding boom. A giant white rune that was over 1,000 feet in size appeared on the surface of the boulder, and an incomparably thick pillar of white light rose up into the sky.Almost at the same time, a mountain in the other direction also shook violently, and a huge green light soared.\"Rumble!\" 8 consecutive loud noises!The 8 seemingly inconspicuous mountains within a hundred kilometers of Nine Palace Mountain made a loud noise at the same time at this moment, and a huge pillar of light of different colors soared from each of the huge runes.Dense runes of various colors appeared around the light pillar, then they quickly connected together, condensing into a huge light curtain in the blink of an eye. With Nine Palace Mountain as the center, all of the light curtain was shrouded in it.Countless multicolored runes flowed endlessly on the light curtain, issuing strange and sharp \"chi chi\" sounds. Even from far away, one could still feel the astonishing spiritual power fluctuations emanating from the light curtain.Somewhere inside the light curtain, Han Li stopped, and his heart sank slightly.Although he didn't know what the Jing Taoist Temple was planning, it seemed that they had evil intentions towards him after all.He glanced around, and a layer of blue light appeared in his pupils, then he frowned slightly.This giant enchantment was mysterious and unpredictable. It was far from the Ghost King Sky Pillar Array of the Tengui School that day. With his insight and knowledge, he couldn't find any weakness for a while.His figure immediately flew out without hesitation, and he came to the front of the colorful light curtain in the blink of an eye. As the six blue lights flashed on his chest and abdomen, he immediately punched somewhere in the light curtain.An earth-shattering loud noise!The surface of the light curtain trembled. The light flashed wildly, and a huge concave fist mark appeared. Around the concave, dense five-color runes gathered, making the concave recover little by little at a speed visible to the naked eye.Before it was completely recovered, another punch landed on the same concave position. The light curtain trembled violently as if it was going to collapse in the next moment.Just as Han Li was about to unleash a third punch, the massive silver moon in the sky suddenly lit up, and countless beams of silver light that were imbued with countless silver runes converged to form a massive pillar of light that encompassed an area with a radius of over 50 kilometers.Han Li only felt a flash of silver light in front of him, and the next moment it returned to normal, but he had appeared in a strange world inexplicably.This was a vast and desolate desert. No matter which direction one looked from, it was a barren wasteland. The ground was littered with large and small gray stones. From time to time, there would be some huge craters, as if they had been hit by meteorites.The sky was filled with thick gray clouds, and it was very low. It seemed that it would press down at any time, giving people a very oppressive feeling.\"Another cave treasure?\" Han Li muttered to himself, and he immediately released his Divine Sense.As a result, in addition to the barren ground, there were deep pits and boulders, and there was nothing else.After a slight hesitation, he condensed his Divine Sense and probed up into the gray clouds.But as soon as his Divine Sense entered, there was a sense of difficulty. It was dizzy everywhere. Even if he used Spirit Refinement Technique, he could only barely sense more than a hundred feet away, and it was still the same situation.He didn't know what was strange about this gray cloud. Even with his powerful Divine Sense, he couldn't completely penetrate it.Han Li's eyes flashed, and he retracted his Divine Sense. When he planned to use other means to explore, the gray cloud above his head suddenly rolled violently and rumbled.The next moment, a yellow light fell from the sky like raindrops and fell on the ground.After each yellow light landed, it inflated like a balloon, and after a blur and deformation, it turned into the appearance of a golden muscular man.These muscular men were about the same size as ordinary people. Their skin was golden, and there was a faint golden halo flowing on it. They were wearing yellow scarves around their waists and holding various weapons. They were very similar to the legendary yellow scarf warriors.Although they looked the same as ordinary people, they didn't have the slightest breath of living beings. Their faces were dull like puppets.In less than a moment, there were nearly a thousand people around, and they surrounded Han Li.Han Li was slightly startled by this sudden turn of events.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThese Yellow Turban Warriors were extremely agile, holding various weapons such as sabers, spears, swords, axes, and so on. As soon as they landed, some of them jumped up, like a large yellow bird gliding in the air, and some of them ran wildly, causing the earth to emit a deafening buzzing sound.In an instant, a dense army of Yellow Turban Warriors rushed toward Han Li from all directions. They covered the sky and the momentum was terrifying.Han Li stood in place and calmly swept his gaze around him.The next moment, a Yellow Turban Warrior was the first to arrive in front of him. The spear in his hand pierced down, turning into a spear shadow. It made an ear-piercing whistling sound and covered most of his body.Han Li's eyebrows moved. He ignored the spear shadows as if they were nothing. He reached out with one hand and grabbed the spear with lightning speed.A turbulent force surged along his arm, causing his body to sway slightly. Although he stabilized himself in an instant, his eyes still flashed with a trace of surprise.The strength of this Yellow Turban Warrior is really amazing!While thinking, he pulled the spear back with his arm, causing the Yellow Turban Warrior to stagger. His other hand clenched into a fist and punched.Bang!The spear in the Yellow Turban Warrior's hand fell out, and his whole body was knocked backward. He smashed into the crowd behind him, knocking dozens of Yellow Turban Warriors in a row before stopping.As a result, the Yellow Turban Warrior turned over and immediately stood up. A clear fist shadow could be seen on his chest.Although his movements were a little slower than before, he still continued to rush toward Han Li with the rest of the Yellow Turban Warriors.Han Li casually tossed the spear in his hand behind him, sending several of the Yellow Scarf Warriors flying. When he turned around and saw this, his pupils shrank. He had used fifty percent of his strength in that punch, shattering a mountain, but he hadn't been able to kill a single Yellow Scarf Warrior.At this time, the surrounding Yellow Turban Warriors had already swarmed over.Han Li snorted coldly. He took a step and his body moved with a series of afterimages. At the same time, he shook his fists and suddenly became blurred.Dense fist shadows appeared and bombarded in all directions.\"Peng Peng\" sounds rang out!The yellow-turbaned strongmen were sent flying one by one, and deep fist marks appeared on their chests. When they collided with the strongmen behind them, they immediately fell to the ground, and the originally aggressive and astonishing offensive slowed down.After the Strongmen that were sent flying fell to the ground, they flipped over and stood up again.Han Li's eyes turned cold. His figure flickered, and he appeared like a ghost in front of a Yellow Turban Strongman who had just been sent flying. Without hesitation, he punched the fist mark on his chest.Crack!The Yellow-scarved Strongman's body shuddered and cracks appeared on the surface of his body. Rays of yellow light shot out from the cracks and his body shattered, turning into a yellow mist that filled the sky and dissipated.Han Li's expression relaxed. Although these yellow cloth puppets' bodies were hard, they were not indestructible.The surrounding Yellow-scarved Strongmen swarmed in like a tide again.Han Li took a light breath, and his chest and abdomen flashed with blue light. Six light spots appeared, and his body suddenly swelled up. Then, his body swayed left and right, and a few blurry figures appeared.Peng Peng Peng!Seven or eight of the Yellow Scarf Warriors that were flying over were sent flying and then directly exploded.Han Li's hands danced like a hurricane, and wherever he passed, a dense fist shadow appeared.A series of loud noises accompanied the roar of the air!Within a dozen feet of him, all the strongmen were sent flying, and their bodies shattered, turning into a yellow mist.No matter how strong these strongmen's bodies were, under the power of the Little Big Dipper Origin Art, it was nothing.\u2026 \u2026Immortal World, a vast and boundless pitch-black sea.Above the sea, the wind whistled, and the black mist filled the air, constantly rolling up a dozen feet high turbid waves.In the sea where the black mist was the densest, there was a huge black city floating steadily.The city was more than a hundred feet high and had a radius of a hundred miles. Above the northern city gate, there were three ancient characters engraved: Blackwater City.The outer city of the city was built with huge black square stones. Occasionally, under the reflection of the sun, it would reflect a crystal-like luster. However, the inside of the city was like an ordinary secular world. There were rivers, fields, trees, streets, and markets.He could also see many people coming and going, and it was an endless stream of people.The city was not flat. The closer one was to the center of the city, the higher the terrain, the closer the buildings were, and the more magnificent the palaces and pavilions were.At the highest point of the huge city, there was a small inner city. It was separated from the other buildings on the periphery by a black river, and there was a clear dividing line.In the Inner City, there were exquisite pavilions and pavilions, quiet and beautiful ponds and water corridors, and there were even artificial mountains and gardens. At the center was a vast platform, and on the platform stood a three-story pavilion with double eaves. It was completely made of wood, with vermilion arches crisscrossing, and a glazed roof with yellow tiles. There were dragon and phoenix sculptures on it, and it was extremely exquisite and gorgeous.On the highest floor of the pavilion, all the windows were wide open. Looking in all directions, the field of vision was very wide. Not only could one see the scenery of the inner city, but even the large black sea outside the city could be seen at a glance.The furnishings in the pavilion were very simple. There was only a square table in the center, and on both sides of the table, there was a round silk praying mat.On the table, there was a dark red copper incense burner with a beast inscribed on it. Green smoke was slowly rising, and the fragrance filled the entire room.On the right side of the praying mat, there was a thin old man with gray hair and a purple lotus crown sitting cross-legged. He was holding an exquisite teacup, and he was carefully sipping it.The color of the tea in the teacup was dark green, and it was even better than jade. The fragrance was faint, and it was not even as fragrant as the sandalwood in the incense burner. However, after entering the mouth, the taste was extremely exquisite, and the spiritual energy was rich, leaving one with an endless aftertaste.The thin old man slowly put down the teacup in his hand, and sincerely praised, \"Fellow Bone Flame, your Black Water Spirit Tea really lives up to its reputation.\"\"Fellow Clear Flame, you flatter me.If you like it, you can bring more back, \"a withered, yellow-faced man with a wide forehead said indifferently.\"Previously, because of the sects in the lower realm, Brother Yan and I did not have much contact. In the future, we should cooperate more and develop together,\" Clear Flame Daoist said with a warm smile.\"If we can take down this person this time, we might have to work together and dig out the secrets that he might be hiding.\" Bone Flame Daoist nodded.\"Speaking of which, what is this person's identity? Did Brother Yan find out?\" Clear Flame Daoist asked with a serious expression.Bone Flame Daoist shook his head and asked, \"After you contacted me last time, I have already asked around through some channels, but I did not obtain any useful information. Did you find anything on your side?\"\"It's not much different from yours, and I also can't find out anything about this person.The information that Ten Direction Tower has leaked is very limited. We only know that the client has a powerful background, but we don't know the specifics. \"Clear Flame Daoist sighed.\"The more it is like this, the more I am interested in the secrets that this person might be hiding.It seems that we can only wait until after this matter is over, \"Bone Flame Daoist said with a chuckle.Clear Flame Daoist laughed heartily and asked, \"Haha, seeing how confident Brother Yan is, you must have some secret treasures to give to your disciples, right?\"Bone Flame Daoist glanced at the thin old man and said, \"Could it be that Fellow Yan doesn't have any trump cards?\"Bone Flame Daoist didn't mind and said with a smile, \"In order to ensure that nothing goes wrong, I naturally have some.\"Bone Flame Daoist saw that the other party didn't want to say more, so he didn't ask any more questions and only casually said this.Seeing that the other party didn't want to say more, Bone Flame Daoist didn't ask any more questions and only casually said this.The thin old man's expression changed when he heard this, and he was extremely shocked.\"It's actually a Dao Soldier \u2026 Fellow Yan, you really have great fortune and astonishing fortune, but it's only a Yellow Turban Dao Soldier of the three lower grade Dao Soldiers. It's not worth mentioning.\"Bone Flame Daoist waved his sleeve and put on an unconcerned expression, but a trace of pride flashed in the depths of his eyes.\"Even if it's a lower grade Dao Soldier, it's still far from what other magic treasures can compare to. With this treasure, even if that Han guy has three heads and six arms, he'll still be able to capture him,\" Clear Flame Daoist said. The envy in his voice didn't decrease in the slightest.Bone Flame Daoist heard this and smiled without saying anything.At this moment, Clear Flame Daoist suddenly thought of something and raised his eyebrows as he asked, \"That's right, this Han Li is also an outer sect elder of Leng Yan Sect in name. That guy, Leng Yan, won't cause trouble and interfere, right?\"Bone Flame Daoist's expression turned cold, and he said with a cold smile, \"If he's not afraid that there will only be two top sects left in Spirit Huan Boundary, then he can come and try.\"Clear Flame Daoist nodded, and his thin face also revealed a hint of a smile.\u2026In a mysterious space, above a thick layer of gray clouds, three figures stood in the air. They were Tong Renjue, Daoist He Shan, and Duan Renli.At this moment, Duan Renli was holding a yellow gourd in his hand, and he was chanting.The gourd was half the size of a person, and its surface was lit up with circles of fine golden words. At the mouth of the gourd, there were some golden runes that were similar to these small words floating around, and they emitted an ethereal aura.As he chanted a series of profound and cryptic incantations, a burst of golden light revolved around the mouth of the gourd, and yellow bean-like objects flew out of it, all of which shot downward.Once these beans came into contact with the gray clouds, tiny whirlpools immediately appeared on the cloud layer, and they were pulled in and swallowed, disappearing without a trace.\"Could this be \u2026 Bean Soldiers!?I didn't expect your sect to be able to use such a legendary celestial technique! \"Daoist He Shan looked at the yellow gourd in Duan Renli's hand with a face full of envy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"I see.Han Li's physical body is strong, so it's really not easy to deal with him with ordinary means.Let these yellow scarf dao soldiers take the lead and consume a lot of his energy first. This is a good move! \"Daoist He Shan nodded and praised.\"It's just an expedient measure to cooperate with Daoist He Shan's cave treasure.Although the first step has been completed, if we really want to kill this kid, we might need the three of us to do it together. \"Tong Renjue said in a deep voice.\"It's almost time. Daoist He Shan, can you let us see the situation below?\" Duan Renli stopped chanting and turned his head to look.Daoist He Shan nodded and raised his hand. A silver light flew out of his hand. There was a silver bead the size of an egg in it.The bead rotated in the air for a brief moment before appearing in front of the three of them.With a \"puff\", the bead burst open. A cloud of silver smoke spread and condensed into a silver mirror of 80 meters in size. After a blur, a clear picture appeared on it.As a result, when the three of them saw the situation in the picture, their faces suddenly changed.On the screen, the Yellow Scarf Warriors descended from the sky and pounced on the tall young man in the middle like a tidal wave from all directions.The tall Youth moved his body. He didn't make many movements, but there were fist shadows blasting out in all directions.The surrounding yellow scarf warriors were like scarecrows. As soon as they touched the fist shadows, they were hit into the air. Yellow light burst and exploded. They couldn't get within 100 meters of him at all.In just a few breaths, 70 to 80 yellow scarf dao soldiers were smashed and sent flying.The Youth looked calm, and his movements didn't slow down at all. It was as if it didn't take much effort to smash these dao soldiers.At this moment, with a \"puff\" sound, the silver mirror distorted and collapsed. It turned into a large cloud of smoke and dissipated.\"This \u2026 how is this possible!\" Duan Renli's face was a little ugly.\"Although these yellow scarf dao soldiers don't know any mystic techniques, their bodies are strong, comparable to high rank strength cultivators.Even we will feel troubled if we are surrounded by hundreds of them, but this Han Li can deal with it so easily. It can be seen that we still underestimated him. \"Tong Renjue frowned.\"Could it be that his injuries have already recovered?\" Taoist He Shan said in a deep voice, and his heart could not help but pound.\"If it's so easy to recover, why would this person leave the Celestial Dimension and come to this Spirit Huan Domain?Now that things have come to this, in for a penny, in for a pound, in for a pound. According to our previous discussion, it is better for the three of us to personally take action to avoid any undue delays. \"Tong Renjue's voice turned cold.\u2026In the Heavenly Abode.Han Li dodged the pincer attack of several Yellow Scarf Warriors. His right arm became a blur and seven or eight fist shadows appeared. Each fist accurately hit the head of a Yellow Scarf Warrior.Bang, bang, bang!The heads of seven or eight strong men burst open, and their bodies flew out. With a \"pu\" sound, they turned into a cloud of yellow mist.The entire process was smooth and clean like flowing water, and in the blink of an eye, close to twenty strong men had been defeated.After a period of fighting, these Yellow Scarf Warriors were no longer a concern in his eyes. The speed of the Yellow Scarf Warriors that appeared in all directions was no longer as fast as he killed them.As the number of surrounding Yellow Scarf Warriors decreased by more than half, a blue light flashed in Han Li's eyes, and he looked towards the gray clouds above. He was prepared to find some clues, and wait for an opportunity to break through the cloud layer in one go to explore the universe.All of a sudden, the streaks of yellow light raining down from above stopped, and the grey clouds in a certain area tremored violently before parting to reveal a rift that was over 100 feet wide. Three streaks of light descended from above before dispersing into the air.The light faded, and the figures of three people were revealed.Han Li's gaze swept across, and his eyes narrowed slightly.Other than Taoist He Shan, who was as fat as a mountain, and Duan Renli, who was holding a yellow gourd, there was also a short and bald old man in a black robe.\"Taoist He Shan, looks like you've joined forces with the Tengui School. What a pity,\" said Han Li with a normal expression.\"Friend Han, you can't blame this poor Taoist.It's really that you've offended someone you shouldn't have, and this poor Taoist had no choice, \"said Taoist He Shan indifferently.\"Oh?Looks like Taoist Duan's face is really not small, \"said Han Li sarcastically as he faintly thought of something, but his expression did not change as he looked at Duan Renli.\"Friend Han, with such strength, you can get whatever you want in this Spirit Huan Domain.If it's just a mere fifty kilograms of Yin Chen Stone, why would my Tengui School make such a big fuss over it? \"said the bald old man in a black robe with a dry laugh.\"If I'm not wrong, you must be the number one cultivator of the Tengui School, Taoist Tong.May I know who I've offended to actually trouble the three of you to attack me at the same time? \"said Han Li as he turned to look at the old man.\"Cough!If Friend Han wants to stall for time, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.Attack! \"Before Tong Renjue finished speaking, he shook his sleeve and took out a greyish ancient book. He raised one hand and pointed at the ancient book.The ancient book instantly started flipping quickly with a rustling sound. Streaks of greyish white flowing light shot out from the pages of the book, and then transformed into strange birds with ghost heads, eagle bodies, and scorpion tails. They were about sixty to seventy feet in size, and in the blink of an eye, dozens of strange birds appeared. They spread their wings and started circling in the sky.\"Friend Han, I'm sorry to offend you!\"As Taoist He Shan spoke, he raised one hand, and a light blue disc-shaped magic treasure flew out and disappeared into the grey clouds in the sky in a flash.Then, he stretched out a finger and pointed at the sky with concentration.Rumble!The thick clouds immediately rolled and let out a deafening roar of thunder. Streaks of thick greyish black lightning appeared and swam in the clouds. It was extremely terrifying.Duan Renli chanted, and the surface of the yellow gourd in his hand was surrounded by golden runes. It let out a sharp roar, and hundreds of yellow beans flew out of the gourd. After landing on the ground, they turned into Yellow Scarf Warriors.The three of them seemed to have agreed on it, and they started to use their techniques at the same time.Han Li's hands did not stop moving. His gaze landed on the yellow gourd, and there was a hint of surprise in his eyes.So this was how these Yellow Scarf Warriors came about!This thought only flashed in his mind for a moment. In the next moment, his arm shook, and densely packed fist shadows appeared and swept across the surroundings. In one breath, all the Yellow Scarf Warriors within a radius of more than a hundred feet were sent flying. Then, he leaped up and was about to fly towards Duan Renli.These three people had taken so much effort to put him into this grotto-heaven space, so they definitely had ulterior motives. They definitely did not just have these techniques on the surface. He had to strike first to gain the upper hand.At this moment, the strange birds in the sky circled slightly in the air, and more than ten of them spread their wings and swooped down towards Han Li.Before their bodies arrived, the scorpion tail behind the strange birds trembled at Han Li.There was a loud sizzling sound!Countless thin black threads came crashing down like a torrential downpour, enshrouding Han Li within.Seeing this situation, Han Li shook his shoulder slightly, and his whole body shot out with a series of afterimages, making all the attacks of the strange birds miss.As a result, when he just stabilized his figure not far away and punched 2 Yellow Scarf Warriors, there was a whistling sound from above again. There were several strange birds swooping down towards him.Almost at the same time, there was a thunderbolt in the sky. A thick gray-black electric snake descended from the sky, and it slashed down aggressively.Han Li frowned slightly. The surface of his body flashed in golden light, and pale golden scales appeared, covering his whole body in an instant. Then, he blasted up with a punch.\"Rumble!\" There was a loud noise!The gray-black electric snake shattered, and a dazzling gray-black electric light burst out.Although Han Li's fist was undamaged, his figure shook, and he took a step back.\"Ding ding dang dang dang\"!It was the attacks of the strange birds' scorpion tails that fell on the scales on his body. There were specks of black light, but not even a trace of white mark was left on it.\"Peng!\"One of the strange birds didn't have enough time to take flight after its attack and was struck by one of the Yellow Scarf Warriors that Han Li had tossed out. It was immediately struck by a burst of unstoppable force, and it let loose an anguished wail before disintegrating along with the Yellow Scarf Warrior.Immediately afterward, there was a loud roar in the air!Streaks of gray-black lightning struck down densely like a thunder rain. The dazzling lightning tore the surrounding gray space, and the power was earth-shattering.The strange birds hovering in the air also launched attacks below from time to time.Han Li's figure was moving erratically. He casually punched and defeated the lightning that couldn't be dodged one by one. There were strange birds that were shot down from time to time, but he could still deal with it freely.However, in this way, he couldn't attack Duan Renli again for a while.As a steady stream of yellow beans flew out of the gourd, and his killing speed was greatly reduced, there were more and more Yellow Scarf Warriors around.After a few breaths, there were as many as three to four thousand Yellow Scarf Warriors gathered around.And what made him feel uneasy was that most of the Yellow Scarf Warriors on the periphery didn't rush to attack him at this time. Instead, after running wildly for a while, they suddenly stopped in place and became motionless.\"Enchantment!\"Han Li's pupils shrank, and these two words suddenly appeared in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as Han Li thought about it, he separated his five fingers and turned his fist into a claw. He lifted a yellow scarf soldier in front of him and threw him toward the yellow scarf soldiers outside.\"Peng!\"A soldier standing still on the periphery was smashed. Under the impact of a huge force, both of them collapsed. The invisible airwave caused several yellow scarf puppets behind him to fall to the ground.Then there was a loud whistling sound!Han Li swung his arms through the air, and one Yellow Scarf Warrior after another was hoisted up without being able to put up any resistance before being flung through the air. The Yellow Scarf Warriors flew through the air in arcs before crashing into the group of Yellow Scarf Warriors around them.As for the attacks of the gray and black lightning and the strange birds that couldn't be dodged, he simply ignored them.In less than two to three breaths, the army of yellow-turbaned strongmen on the periphery suddenly fell in disorder and fell into chaos.\"Don't wait any longer, finish it quickly!\" Tong Renjue's face sank, and he shouted coldly.After he finished speaking, he immediately flipped his hand and took out a dark yellow token that seemed to be covered in rust. His other hand made a strange gesture as he quickly chanted, and the surface of the token suddenly emitted a dazzling yellow glow.Han Li tilted his head, and his pupils shrank suddenly!Although he didn't know what this token was, when the old man took out this thing, he was a little shocked.But before he could do anything, the yellow token in Tong Renjue's hand suddenly flew out. It turned into a dazzling yellow light and landed on the top of Han Li's head. It rotated, and the strange yellow spirit patterns lit up in circles.A strange scene appeared!All the thousands of yellow scarf soldiers standing still in the periphery raised their hands high above their heads at the same time, making a crossing gesture as if a fire was ignited. Their bodies suddenly bloomed with dazzling yellow light, and it quickly gathered at the crossing point of their arms and soared into the sky.All the dazzling yellow light connected and expanded in the air, like a layer of yellow light curtain. It instantly covered an area of thousands of meters with Han Li as the center.At the moment when the yellow light covered his body, Han Li only felt that his body suddenly sank as if he was pressed by a giant mountain. His body became a little sluggish.At this moment, the \"puff puff\" sound came one after another!Wisps of yellow mist rose up from the ground that had been enshrouded by the yellow light, intertwining with one another to form a series of yellow ropes that flew toward him like spirit snakes. The ropes instantly bound his body in a tight manner.Almost in the blink of an eye, Han Li's waist, arms, and legs were tied tightly to the ground, so that he couldn't move at all.Han Li knew that it was not good. He madly channeled the Little Big Dipper Yuan Technique. His chest and abdomen flashed wildly. The divine power in his body burst out. He twisted his body, and his arms suddenly pulled.The yellow ropes that entangled his body were suddenly tightened, and the thinnest of them were even trembling. Although they were still tied, they couldn't completely restrict his movements.At the same time, the yellow gourd that was originally held by Duan Renli flew to the top of his head and floated motionlessly.Duan Renli opened his mouth and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood essence on it. At the same time, a low incantation came out of his mouth.The surface of the gourd in the air shone with yellow light and expanded to the size of a house. The golden talisman that was floating around the mouth of the gourd became the size of a palm and emitted a dazzling golden light.\"Hualala\"Countless yellow beans shot out from the mouth of the gourd, like the Yellow River bursting its dike.These newly born yellow turban strongmen stood still after running for a while. They also crossed their hands above their heads and released a dazzling yellow light that merged into the yellow light curtain above.Han Li clenched his fists. Under the pull of the yellow ropes, he continued to punch several times. He blew up the strongmen and strange birds in front of him, but his movements became more and more sluggish.It seemed that with every additional strongman, the light curtain above became a little more solid. At the same time, it caused the yellow fog that came out of the ground to become a little more solid.In this way, the yellow fog that came out of the ground became more and more dense, causing the ropes that wrapped around his body to become more solid and solid.He only felt that his body had become incomparably heavy, as if his arms were carrying several mountains, and it was becoming more and more difficult to move them. Moreover, those mysterious yellow ropes continued to tighten, leaving deep marks on the outside of his clothes.All of a sudden, golden light flashed from his body, and he let loose a low cry as strands of golden fur sprouted from his skin. In the blink of an eye, he transformed into a giant golden ape, and his body also swelled drastically in size.He used the 12 Awakening Mantra again and transformed into a giant mountain ape!Tong Renjue and Taoist He Shan were slightly stunned when they saw the giant ape that had expanded to more than a hundred feet in size.Although they had already heard about this strange secret technique of Han Li from Duan Renli, they were still shocked by the terrifying aura that his body emitted when they saw it with their own eyes.\"Taoist He Shan, what are you waiting for?\"Tong Renjue shouted in a low voice and put away the ancient book in front of him. Then, he focused all his attention on activating the formation below.Taoist He Shan immediately returned to his senses and stopped activating the greyish-black lightning. With a serious expression, he muttered an incantation. At the same time, his hands were constantly forming seals. Suddenly, the surface of his body was densely packed with strange golden runes. Then, a layer of golden light was released from his body.At this time, there were more than ten thousand yellow-turbaned strongmen around the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into.Endless yellow fog surged out of the ground and converged into the yellow ropes that wrapped around the giant golden-furred ape's body, causing them to become thicker and stronger. There were no signs of them breaking.\"Roar!\" An angry roar rang out!The giant ape's body crackled like beans exploding. The muscles all over its body swelled up as if they were inflated. The golden fur all over its body became as hard as steel needles and stood on end. Its body doubled in size again, reaching more than a hundred feet tall.However, the yellow ropes wrapped around its body also rapidly increased in size under a flash of yellow light. They became even thicker and tougher, but they still firmly bound him.At this time, the giant ape's body suddenly shone and its body rapidly shrank to a hundred feet tall.But almost at the same time, the yellow ropes also changed like maggots in a tarsal bone and shrunk in size.No matter how big or small the giant ape became, the ropes always just happened to restrain it. It was as if they were tailor-made for him, making it impossible for him to break free.\"You still want to break free now? You're delusional!\" Duan Renli could not help but laugh wildly when he saw this scene.\"Taoist He Shan, what are you waiting for?\" Tong Renjue looked at the nearby Taoist He Shan and shouted with a frown.The latter did not answer. With a wave of his golden robe, a golden light shot out like lightning and flew above the giant golden ape's head. A greenish-gray ancient scroll appeared.Daoist He Shan pointed at the scroll from afar and shouted, \"What are you waiting for?\"Go!\"Golden light immediately shot out from the tip of his finger, transforming into a streak of golden light that flew into the quaint scroll. Azure light flashed from the scroll, and it immediately swayed left and right a few times before unfurling itself with a whoosh.A dazzling golden light lit up from the surface of the scroll and a golden Nascent Soul that was five or six inches in size flew out from it.It wore a lotus crown on its head and an ochre yellow Taoist robe. Its appearance was old and its expression was calm. It was surprisingly quite similar to the Realm Taoist Temple's Ancestor, Clarity Taoist.At the same time, Taoist He Shan kept chanting. The scroll that had already been opened shone with golden light and golden characters flew out one after another, rushing into the Nascent Soul's shadow.The small golden person's body was suddenly wrapped in golden light and elongated, transforming into a giant golden sword that was more than a hundred feet long.The body of the sword was engraved with strange golden runes. Its entire body was surrounded by circles of runes and emitted waves of terrifying fluctuations that made one's heart palpitate.The moment Tong Renjue and Duan Renli saw the appearance of the giant golden sword, they couldn't help but look at each other and see a trace of shock in each other's eyes.The giant ape that Han Li had transformed into suddenly raised his head and looked up.He suddenly clenched his fists and six huge blue balls of light simultaneously lit up on his chest and abdomen. The muscles on his arms swelled and he struggled to pull his arms back in front of him, wanting to meet the giant sword above.However, the mysterious yellow rope that wrapped around his arms suddenly shone brightly and became as taut as a steel spear. It seemed to be somewhat unable to restrain him and he slowly pulled his arms back in front of his chest.\"Not good, quickly!\" Duan Renli shouted.Tong Renjue's face was a little pale. His ten fingers were already flying like wheels as he constantly cast spell after spell.The mysterious yellow token in mid-air suddenly sped up!The yellow light that appeared on the bodies of the more than ten thousand Yellow Turban Warriors also shone brightly. More mysterious yellow Qi emerged from the ground, causing the mysterious yellow rope that bound the giant golden ape's body to tighten again and the pulling force became even stronger.The giant ape's body suddenly trembled and the arm that he had just retracted to his chest was immediately pulled back.\"Quick!\"Daoist He Shan finally finished casting his spell and shouted.The giant golden light sword that was suspended in the air suddenly shook and turned into a golden waterfall that slashed down on the giant golden ape's head.Boom! Boom!The giant golden light sword cut through the layers of the void and emitted waves of thunderous roars. Everywhere it passed, an incomparably thin greyish-white crack flashed and disappeared, emitting bursts of intense spatial fluctuations.The area that was covered by the sword light was distorted and became blurry. Even the clouds above were somewhat dislocated and deformed. The two to three hundred strange ghost-headed birds that were originally circling in the sky couldn't evade in time. With a mournful cry, they were directly annihilated and turned into nothingness.At this moment, the giant golden ape's body couldn't break free from the mysterious yellow rope's binding and couldn't evade at all.At this critical moment, the giant ape suddenly raised his head and roared. His body suddenly shone with golden light, and golden scales appeared all over his body. In an instant, a green horn appeared on the top of his head.In the instant that the giant sword fell, the giant ape's body slightly leaned back and stiffened his neck. He suddenly used his head to ram upwards.Boom! An earth-shattering sound rang out!The tip of the giant golden sword heavily pressed against the green horn on the giant ape's forehead. All the sword light emitted by the body of the sword exploded in an instant, turning into a sky full of golden rain that sprinkled down in all directions.Almost the entire void shook crazily. Dozens of greyish-white cracks appeared near the light sword and disappeared in a flash. With the giant ape as the center, the bodies of the yellow-turbaned strongmen in a radius of nearly a thousand feet also collapsed with a loud bang.In the bright light, the body of the golden sword trembled violently and bent a huge arc that made people speechless. With a bounce, it was actually repelled.The giant golden ape's body only swayed for a moment and then immediately returned to its original state. There didn't seem to be any injuries on its body.\"How is this possible!\"Seeing this, Daoist He Shan couldn't help but cry out involuntarily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHigh up in the sky, the golden sword trembled with golden light all over its body. It flew backward for more than a thousand feet before stabilizing again.However, before Taoist He Shan could activate any technique, the runes on the surface of the sword that seemed to be psychic suddenly lit up in circles. The golden light on the body of the sword soared again by more than a foot, and it rushed toward the giant ape again. Its momentum was even more powerful than the previous strike.Due to the decrease in the number of Yellow Turban Warriors around, the pressure on the golden ape that Han Li had transformed into was greatly reduced. He twisted his body slightly and faced the giant sword head-on. He suddenly took a breath, and his chest swelled up high. He suddenly opened his bloody mouth, and the blue light in his eyes suddenly brightened. He let out an earth-shattering roar.\"Roar!\"A transparent wave that was visible to the naked eye spewed out of the giant ape's mouth and surged diagonally upward.The void above twisted, and it was immediately like the ground had been smashed by a meteorite. It sank more than a hundred feet deep, and everything nearby became blurred.This roar was not ordinary. It was another great ability that Han Li had after transforming into the Giant Mountain Ape, the \"Vajra Roar\". It was an unimaginably powerful sound wave technique. With his current physical strength, it was enough to shatter the void.\"Boom!\"There was another loud sound. The golden sword suddenly smashed into the transparent wave with great force. It immediately stopped and trembled violently, and it seemed to be unable to advance any further.As the sound wave continued to vibrate, there was a loud \"ka ka\" sound. The dazzling golden sword light shattered like a mirror, and the surface of the giant sword gradually protruded slightly. An old face could be vaguely seen. From the facial features, it was Dao Master Clarity from before.Then, fine cracks began to appear on the body of the sword. Soon, amid a series of clanging sounds, it broke inch by inch and turned into a golden light that dissipated.All of this took a long time to describe, but it only took an instant.The shadow of Dao Master Clarity's Nascent Soul flashed out of the golden light and reappeared in the air.The light on its body was a little dim, and its small face showed a bit of shock. Without saying anything, it turned to the scroll floating in the air and disappeared in a flash.And almost at the same time, a long and narrow blood mark suddenly split open between the eyebrows of the golden giant ape. A cloud of black gas surged out from it, and instantly transformed into a huge pitch-black demon eye. It was the \"Law of Destruction\" that could penetrate the void.The black demon eye stood upright, and it suddenly spat out a black thread of light. It flashed and disappeared into the void.\"Peng!\"In midair, when it was only a step away from the ancient scroll, that streak of black light suddenly flashed and fiercely struck the Nascent Soul projection that had already reappeared.The Nascent Soul projection immediately let loose an anguished wail as it dissipated into a ball of golden light, and the scroll was also incinerated into nothingness by a burst of scorching flames.\"This is \u2026 the Law of Destruction!\" Seeing this, Tong Renjue's complexion changed dramatically.Duan Renli saw that the treasure bestowed by the Immortal Ancestor of the Jing Yuan Temple had been destroyed by the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into. Even the trace of Primordial Spirit contained in it had been destroyed. Duan Renli's complexion also became ashen.\"What!This person actually has such a magical power that can break the teleportation technique? \"Daoist He Shan suddenly became timid. He could no longer care about the magic treasure bestowed by the Ancestor. His complexion became extremely ugly.And at this moment, a scene that made the few people's souls fly out of their bodies occurred!The body of the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into flashed with silver light. A large amount of silver flames suddenly surged out from under his fur and wrapped his entire body.Only yellow smoke could be seen rising from the giant ape's body. The mysterious yellow ropes that were tightly wrapped around his body and couldn't be broken gradually melted in the burning silver flames and broke apart.Freed from the bindings, the giant golden ape beat its chest with both hands and rolled on the ground. The silver flames on its body disappeared and were replaced by countless silver arcs that shot out wantonly.Countless silver arcs curled around it. A giant silver bird that was more than 100 feet long suddenly spread its wings and flew out. Its feathers were like steel and its claws were like hooks. It was very similar to the legendary true spirit Kun Peng.It was another true spirit transformation of the 12 Awakening Transformations, Thunder Peng.\"Not good \u2026\" Tong Renjue whispered and quickly made a hand seal.The mysterious yellow token spun wildly, and the mysterious yellow Qi on the ground once again surged out in a frenzy, entangling the Thunder Peng again.Duan Renli also immediately changed his hand seal. After the yellow beans that sprayed out from the giant yellow gourd in the air turned into yellow-turbaned warriors, they no longer flew into the formation. Instead, they overwhelmingly pounced on the giant bird.However, the giant bird only flapped its wings and turned into a silver hurricane. It suddenly disappeared from where it was, causing the ropes and warriors to pounce on empty air.Before the three Grand Ascension Stage beings had a chance to react, a bolt of silver lightning suddenly flashed up above, and the Silver Lightning Bird suddenly appeared in the air above the giant yellow gourd before grabbing onto it with its hooked talons.There was a flash of light in the air, and the Thunder Peng and the gourd shrank at the same time.After a short while, Han Li returned to his human form, holding a yellow gourd that was a foot tall in his hand.Seeing this, Daoist He Shan's expression became completely gloomy. He gritted his teeth and said, \"We're no match for him. Let's go.\" He then turned into a streak of light and flew away into the distance.Tong Renjue and Duan Renli didn't hesitate in the slightest and immediately chased after him. They didn't even care about the mysterious yellow token in the air.After Han Li took a look at the gourd in his hand, azure light suddenly lit up in his hand. He rubbed the surface of the gourd forcefully, and the golden runes that were originally engraved on the gourd immediately became blurry. He then rubbed his hand again, and the runes completely dimmed and disappeared.Almost at the same time, whether it was the formation on the ground or the Yellow Turban Warriors that were charging toward Han Li, all of them seemed to be suddenly exhausted and collapsed to the ground. Then, yellow light flashed around their bodies and they turned into yellow peas that scattered all over the ground.The yellow formation formed by them naturally collapsed in an instant and vanished into thin air.He flipped his hand over and put away the gourd. He glanced at the three people that were fleeing into the sky and sneered. The silver lightning around his body crackled, and he turned into a Thunder Peng again. With a flap of his wings, he disappeared from where he was.At this moment, Duan Renli, who was fleeing with all his might, felt his throat dry and his heart filled with bitterness.Previously, because he was controlling the gourd and the Yellow Turban Dao Soldier, he had used up a lot of his Fa Li. At this moment, he was clearly slower than He Shan and Tong Renjue, and they left him far behind.Just as he was complaining incessantly, he suddenly heard a buzzing sound in his ears.He suddenly thought of something, and immediately felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar. He felt a chill all over his body.At this moment, less than a thousand feet above his head, there was a ripple. Silver lightning suddenly appeared, and a pair of huge sharp hooked claws suddenly broke through the air.Countless thin silver arcs shot out and circled around the hooked claws. In the shocking lightning, they gradually formed a huge circular electric net that enveloped him.Duan Renli was not an easy person to cultivate to the Mahayana realm. He was already prepared. Suddenly, a large patch of blood-red light appeared on his body. He opened his mouth, and the blood-red mini ancient banner that was a few inches tall immediately shot out. In an instant, it turned into a huge banner that was ten feet tall.Blood light flowed on the banner, and a foul wind blew. Countless blood mist spread out, turning into a huge blood cloud that enveloped his body.However, before his body could completely disappear, there was a flash of silver light above, and the Thunder Roc appeared with lightning all over its body. It retracted its claws and dove down like a meteor, instantly smashing into the blood cloud.There was a rumble of an explosion!Within the blood cloud, silver lightning flashed and surged violently.With a loud cry, the Thunder Roc's body directly tore the entire blood cloud into two, and it flew out from within.Below it, a human figure was caught in the pair of sharp hooked claws. He was struggling and twisting violently like a caterpillar. The expression on his face was incomparably terrified, and black blood flowed out of his seven apertures. He looked incomparably miserable.At this moment, the silver Thunder Roc suddenly spoke, and its voice was like thunder.\"Fellow Duan, Han previously showed mercy to you because he didn't want to cause trouble. I didn't expect you to be so ignorant.Since that's the case, don't blame me for being merciless. \"With that, its hooked claws suddenly tightened, and a dazzling silver light suddenly lit up in the center of its claws. Countless lightning bolts suddenly exploded.Duan Renli let out a miserable cry, and half of his body was torn apart in the silver lightning.Immediately afterward, a dark red little person with a horrified expression flashed out from the remains of the body with a horrified expression. Before it could escape far away, it was hit by a silver lightning bolt and instantly turned into a cloud of green smoke. It didn't even have the time to let out a scream before it dissipated.A Mahayana Stage cultivator who had commanded the wind and rain in the Spirit Huan Domain for tens of thousands of years was destroyed just like that, leaving not a trace in the world.From the appearance of the Thunder Roc that Han Li transformed into to killing Duan Renli, this series of actions was like a spark, and it only took a few breaths of time.Tong Renjue and Taoist He Shan obviously didn't plan to help this companion of theirs, and at this moment, they had already escaped without a trace.\u2026 \u2026Celestial Realm, Black Water City Inner City.Spiritual Master Clarity and Bone Flame Sanren were still drinking tea and chatting in the third floor of the Double Eaves Pavilion, but the topic had unknowingly shifted to exchanging cultivation experiences.As the two of them were talking to their heart's content, Spiritual Master Clarity's face paled, and he spat out a ball of bright red Essence Blood. It seemed that his vitality had been greatly damaged.\"Fellow Clarity, what's wrong?\" Bone Flame Sanren raised his eyebrows, and hurriedly asked.\"The Spirit Infant Sword Talisman that I gave to the lower realm was broken by someone!\" Spiritual Master Clarity's face was as gloomy as water, and he said word by word.\"Impossible, how could such a thing happen!Your Spirit Infant Sword Talisman is equivalent to your full power attack, and even I don't dare to face it head-on. Moreover, with the help of my Yellow Turban Dao Soldier, how could it not be able to kill this person? \"Bone Flame Sanren was also moved when he heard this.Spiritual Master Clarity's face was ugly, and he didn't speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the grey space.Tong Renjue and Taoist He Shan had transformed into two shadows and were flying through the air at lightning speed.Flying at full speed with their cultivation, they instantly covered a distance of ten thousand kilometers.Especially after Duan Renli's aura disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye, the two of them did not hesitate to expend a large amount of vitality to activate a secret technique, greatly increasing their speed.How many tens of thousands of years had it been since they'd had this feeling of having their souls soar into the heavens? After all, in the entire Spirit Huan World, there were only a handful of people whose cultivation was on par with them, and at their level, they naturally wouldn't engage in battle casually.\"Taoist He Shan, now is the time!Quickly cast a technique to open up a spatial tunnel. If we don't leave this grotto-heaven, we will die! \"Tong Renjue looked behind him and said urgently.\"Alright!\"Daoist He Shan nodded. With a flip of his hand, a palm-sized silver disk appeared in his hand. Azure light flashed on his other hand, and he struck the disk without any hesitation as he began to chant.A ball of silver light immediately bloomed from the disk, and as he chanted, it gradually became dazzling. Densely packed silver runes appeared.In the next moment, a dozen or so silver rays of light shot out from the silver light at the same time. They gathered and intertwined in the air in front of the two of them, gradually transforming into a blurry silver pattern that emitted a trace of spatial fluctuation.At this moment, a blurry sound of thunder came from behind the two of them.When the two of them heard this, their expressions immediately changed.A spot of silver light flashed continuously as it chased them from behind. As it flashed, it constantly grew larger, and its speed was far faster than the two of them.\"How much longer?\" Tong Renjue asked in a low voice.\"Ten breaths \u2026 No, eight breaths!\" Taoist He Shan's hands did not stop forming seals as he answered hurriedly.\"I'll block him, hurry up!\" Tong Renjue's expression changed as he gritted his teeth and said.As soon as he finished speaking, he chanted in a low voice. At the same time, he waved his hand and tore off the black robe on his body, revealing his naked upper body.On his seemingly thin and weak chest, a dark red ghost pattern was imprinted. It was emitting a flickering blood-red light, as if it was a violent living creature that was constantly struggling.There were a few white objects on the ghostly creature's body that emitted a faint white light, faintly suppressing the bloody light.Tong Renjue took a deep breath and formed a seal with both hands. Then, his fingers tapped on the white objects a few times at lightning speed.Balls of dazzling white light lit up from these white objects, and unknown white runes appeared. Then, they trembled and shot out with a few \"pu pu\" sounds. They were a total of 13 white bone nails.As soon as the bone nail was removed, the blood-red ghost pattern suddenly let out an excited roar, as if a terrifying demon had finally broken free from its shackles.An extremely dazzling bloody light erupted from Tong Renjue's chest and enveloped his entire body, forming over a dozen extremely thick bloody pillars of light. Terrifying energy rippled out from them, and it caused the surrounding space to tremble.Amidst the bloody light, Tong Renjue revealed a pained expression and groaned.Crackling sounds suddenly rang out from within his body, and his muscles squirmed as if they were alive as his body rapidly swelled up.In the blink of an eye, his entire body had transformed into a huge ghostly creature that was hundreds of feet tall, with a green face and fangs.This ghostly creature was somewhat similar to the Crimson Blood Heavenly Ghost that Duan Renli had previously summoned. It was just like another Heavenly Ghost, but it was even more terrifying.Mysterious black and red patterns appeared on the surface of his body. What was even stranger was that there were hundreds of eyes growing on his chest, arms, legs, and even the instep of his feet. They blinked incessantly and emitted a faint black light, sending chills down the spines of those who looked at them.In particular, there was a vertical eye between its eyebrows. It was especially huge, and the eyebrows of the eye below it were squeezed to the side, making it look even more ferocious.However, this eye was tightly shut.As soon as the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost appeared, an enormous aura that was far stronger than before emanated from its body, causing the surrounding space to fluctuate.Just then, there was a flash of silver lightning!A silver Thunder Roc that was more than a hundred feet long appeared in front of the two in a flash. When it saw the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost that Tong Renjue had transformed into, a trace of surprise flashed in its eyes.Then, the Thunder Roc spread its wings, and a thunderous sound resounded from its body. Countless silver thunderbolts emerged on the surface of its body, and it suddenly grabbed forward with its claws.\"Whoosh!\"A frightening giant claw of thunder and lightning appeared out of thin air, and grabbed toward the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost's head.The giant claw had yet to fall, but a terrifying force had already arrived with a loud bang, and the surrounding space suddenly tightened.In the face of such an attack, the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost's face didn't show the slightest trace of fear. It weaved its hands in an incantation gesture, and nearly half of its eyes lit up at the same time, and shot out beams of black light.Dozens of beams of light intertwined together, and formed a black light net, which collided with the giant claw of thunder and lightning.At the moment when the two collided, a faint fluctuation of law emerged from the black light net.The giant claw of thunder and lightning suddenly disappeared from its original place with a flash. Then, it reappeared thousands of feet away, as if it had teleported.\"Bang!\" A loud muffled sound was heard, and the giant claw of thunder and lightning bombarded the Void. Countless silver thunderbolts exploded, and the surrounding space tumbled and surged.\"Huh!\"There was a flash of surprise in the Thunder Roc's eyes, and then it flapped its wings again.Two fan-shaped silver thunderbolts shot out from its wings, and appeared on both sides of the Heavenly Ghost in a flash, and attacked from both sides.The eyes on the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost's body lit up again, and beams of black light shot out to meet the two fan-shaped thunderbolts from both sides.The faint fluctuation of law appeared again, and the two fan-shaped thunderbolts disappeared into thin air, and then reappeared thousands of feet away. They collided with each other, and shattered.Not far away, Taoist He Shan saw this scene, and was immediately delighted.At this time, only two or three breaths had passed, and under his full power, the silver pattern in mid-air gradually became solid.The Thunder Roc that Han Li had transformed into withdrew its wings, and stopped its attack. It turned a blind eye to Taoist He Shan's actions, and spoke to the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost in front of him in the human language:\"I didn't expect to see someone in this Spirit Huan Domain who can use the power of space. He is worthy of the title of the first Mahayana Stage cultivator in this domain.\"\"Friend Han, actually, there is no enmity between us, and there is no need for such a big fight.This matter originated from the Upper Realm, and we are only acting on orders. Now that Duan Renli is dead, it is time for you to vent your anger.No matter how remarkable you are, if you really turn the Spirit Huan Domain upside down, the Upper Realm will not tolerate it. \"The Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost had a vigilant expression, and spoke in a tone that was half threatening and half pleading for peace.\"Hehe, looks like this matter is indeed related to the patriarchs of your two sects.However, they are far away in the Immortal Realm, and they are far away from the matter here. \"The Thunder Roc laughed coldly.\"How dare you \u2026\" The Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost was stunned.Before it could finish speaking, the Thunder Roc suddenly raised its head, and let out a high-pitched shrill cry.The silver electric arcs around its body lit up again, and gathered toward its claws. They emitted a shocking silver light, and formed a huge circular electric net.At the same time, strange runes that flashed with silver light flew out of its claws, and sank into the electric net.The electric arcs on the silver electric net suddenly burst soundlessly like bubbles, and a dazzling silver light burst out from within. Then, it suddenly condensed, and turned into two shiny silver thunder balls.The surface of the thunder balls was covered with a layer of silver runes, and there were silver electric sparks flying around it. A low rumbling sound came from within, and it emitted a terrifying aura that could destroy everything in its path.It was the Art of Thunder Sacrifice!The thunder and lightning used in this pearl was the power of the Thunder Roc's silver thunder and lightning, so it was not completely the same as the Thunder Pearl that he used to condense with the Divine Lightning of Evil.The Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost let out a low roar, and the red and black patterns all over its body bloomed. Then, the hundreds of eyes on its body suddenly lit up at the same time.The Thunder Roc raised its claws, and two silver thunder balls immediately flew out. They flew in front of the Heavenly Ghost at an incomparably fast speed, and immediately exploded.\"Boom!\"Suddenly, two silver blazing suns appeared in mid-air. The silver light surged violently, and expanded rapidly. Electric sparks flew in all directions. Countless silver runes appeared on the surface of the blazing suns, and they emitted a terrifying aura that could destroy the heavens and the earth.Even though Tong Renjue had already anticipated the power of Han Li's attack, his facial expression still changed when he saw it with his own eyes.The Heavenly Ghost that he had transformed into roared wildly, and all the eyes on its body suddenly opened wide. The corners of its eyes seemed to be faintly cracking, and its pupils became bloodshot.Whoosh! Whoosh!Whoosh! Streaks of black light that were almost twice as thick as before flew out, and interweaved to form a huge black net.At the same time, the vertical eye on its forehead suddenly opened, and revealed a huge pitch-black eye.Whoosh!A thick black light flew out, and submerged into the big black net.The big black net suddenly lit up, and transformed into a layer of black light screen. Then, it covered its entire body from head to toe.The two silver suns fiercely fell down, and bombarded the black light screen.The black light screen immediately shone brightly, and emitted a strong fluctuation of the principles.Nearly half of the radiance of the two blazing suns suddenly froze, and it seemed as if it had been frozen. However, the other half of the silver light wasn't affected, and it continued to rush downwards with a loud rumbling sound.The black light screen buzzed and trembled, and the radiance on its surface flashed wildly. However, it didn't dissipate.Both sides seemed to be in a stalemate.Suddenly, a loud roar came from the black light screen. Then, the black light screen suddenly expanded, and countless black runes appeared on its surface.The two silver suns flashed, and suddenly disappeared from their original places. Then, they flashed and appeared in the void far away.Rumble!The two blazing suns exploded completely, and turned into two sky-high thunder pillars. They soared into the sky, and easily pierced through the grey clouds in mid-air. The bottom of the pillars also penetrated deep into the ground, and created two big holes.A huge wave of power spread out from the huge thunder pillars, and set off a hurricane within a radius of several dozen miles.Just then, the black light screen also collapsed in a flash, and the figure of the Hundred-eyed Heavenly Ghost appeared.However, it looked extremely terrible at the moment. It was panting heavily, and the hundreds of eyes on its body were half-closed. The black light they emitted was also extremely dim, and it seemed that its vitality had been greatly damaged.Seeing this, Daoist He Shan's face was filled with shock. However, it was clear that he was also at the last moment of his spell casting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDaoist He Shan was overjoyed. He changed his hand seal and spat out a mouthful of blood essence, which fused into the silver moon diagram in a flash.Within the silver moon pattern, streaks of silver light suddenly swept forth from the silver moon that was hidden within the Bi An. The streaks of silver light intertwined and transformed into a shimmering silver vortex.Waves of spatial power rippled out from within, and with a muffled thunderclap, a spot of white light could be vaguely seen in the depths of the vortex.The moment before the spatial passageway opened, the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost and Han Li's Lei Peng looked over at the same time. The former looked delighted, while the latter's eyes flickered with blue light.As a result, Daoist He Shan's gaze only briefly swept past the Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost before immediately landing on the Lei Peng. His heart shuddered as he abruptly turned around like a rabbit and rushed into the silver vortex.Immediately thereafter, spatial fluctuations erupted within the vortex before it burst like a bubble, transforming into specks of silver light that disappeared without a trace.Only a few faint spatial fluctuations were left in the void.From the opening of the spatial passageway to its closing, it took less than the time of a breath.\"He Shan I!\"The Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost was enraged when it saw that Daoist He Shan not only escaped alone, but also closed the spatial passageway.The blue light in Han Li's Lei Peng's eyes faded, revealing a thoughtful expression.In that short moment, he had already captured all the changes in the spatial vortex's opening and closing.The Lei Peng withdrew its gaze and said coldly, \"Fellow Daoist Tong, now that only you and I are left here, it's fine. Let's settle our grudges with your sect first.\"As soon as it finished speaking, the silver lightning on its body suddenly brightened, and with a loud clap of thunder, its huge figure disappeared without a trace.The Hundred-Eyed Heavenly Ghost was greatly alarmed and could no longer be bothered with its resentment towards Daoist He Shan. Its pupils shrank, and it abruptly formed a hand seal. Countless viscous black Qi surged out of its body, turning into a dozen thick tentacles that danced wildly around its body.Thunder rumbled behind it, and silver light flashed. The Lei Peng's figure emerged, and its two huge claws blurred, turning into two blurry afterimages that swiped at its back with incredible speed.As a result, the black tentacles behind Sky Demon reacted extremely quickly, wrapping around Lei Peng like lightning.A trace of surprise appeared in Lei Peng's eyes. Immediately, the silver arcs of lightning around his body flourished, and many silver runes appeared around the arcs.Bang, bang, bang!The spell symbols exploded one after another, and countless silvery lightning threads darted out, puncturing the black tentacles with thousands of holes. Then, the tentacles dispersed into countless wisps of black smoke, and disappeared without a trace in the lightning light.The Hundred-Eyed Sky Ghost's back was also struck by the silver thunderbolts, and its lower back was struck by a thick electric arc. Seven or eight of its eyes were shattered, and black blood was gushing out.He let out a muffled groan, and his figure flashed as he hurriedly dashed forward.\"Rumble!\" A loud noise came from behind him.The Lightning Roc clawed at the air with its claws, and silver arcs of lightning converged around its body to form two more balls of silver lightning.It raised its claws, and two balls of lightning soared into the sky, disappearing into the gray clouds.Immediately, an earth-shattering noise rang out from the clouds, and dazzling silver lightning tore through the gray clouds, casting a blinding silver light down.Two incomparably thick silver lightning pillars suddenly shot out from the clouds, surrounded by countless silver runes, and struck down at an incredible speed toward the fleeing Hundred-Eyed Sky Ghost.The Heavenly Ghost was greatly shocked, and its body glowed with a black light. It forced its eyes to widen again, and the black light flickered in its pupils. It was about to exert the Law of Space.Just then, a bone-chilling snort suddenly rang out in the Hundred-Eyed Sky Ghost's ears!Then, a loud bang sounded in its mind, as if someone had stabbed it with a sharp awl, and a soul-tearing pain suddenly erupted.The Heavenly Ghost suddenly held its head with both hands, and let out a blood-curdling scream. Black blood flowed out of its seven orifices on its face.The black light in the nearly one hundred eyes around it became disordered, and then dissipated.Amidst the deafening roar of thunder, two silver lightning pillars suddenly struck down and struck the Hundred-Eyed Sky Ghost's body.An earth-shattering boom rang out!The Hundred-Eyed Sky Ghost let out a shrill scream, and its body was instantly pierced by two large holes by the lightning pillars, one of which was in its chest.The Heavenly Ghost's body was nearly split into two, and black and red blood gushed out. Its broken body fell heavily from midair, and smashed into the ground.With a muffled cracking sound, the Hundred-Eyed Sky Ghost's body rapidly shrank, and in the blink of an eye, it had turned into a short, bald old man. There were large holes in its lower abdomen and chest, and its injuries were extremely serious.A large amount of blood gushed out of Tong Renjue's mouth. He looked panic-stricken, and the light in his eyes was extremely dim.But the next moment, a ferocious look flashed across his face, and he suddenly made a hand sign with both hands.Circles of black crystal light suddenly swirled on the surface of his body, and his thin body began to swell wildly.\"Self-destruct!\"Lei Peng murmured in midair, and waved its claws under its abdomen. Dazzling silver lightning arcs once again appeared on its surface, and then rolled and converged, turning into a silver lightning ball in the blink of an eye.Rumble!Tong Renjue had actually taken the initiative to self-destruct. The violent shockwaves caused the nearby void to be torn apart. Black light surged out from within, causing the silver lightning ball to be shaken and slow down its descent.\"Whoosh!\" A Nascent Soul that was several inches tall flashed out of the black light, and in the blink of an eye, it was already several hundred feet away in the void. Then, its protective spiritual light flashed wildly, and it turned into a black light, and was about to teleport away again.In the blink of an eye, the silver lightning ball suddenly exploded, and turned into an incomparably huge silver blazing sun. It immediately spread out in all directions, and in the blink of an eye, it submerged Tong Renjue's Nascent Soul.\"Whoosh!\" An object flew out of the silver light, and in a flash, it flew towards the Lei Peng above.After a short moment, the silver blazing sun slowly dissipated, and a large pitch-black pit appeared on the ground.Tong Renjue had completely disappeared without a trace, and not even a trace was left behind.With a flash of silver light, the Lei Peng disappeared, and Han Li's figure appeared. He was holding a red bag in one hand, and it was emitting a faint red light.After continuously changing his body and fighting fiercely, his face was abnormally pale, and the Fa Li in his Dantian had already been depleted.He put away the red bag in his hand, and then took out a thousand-year Cloud Crane Grass and consumed it. Then, he raised his head and looked into the void. He muttered an incantation, and his sleeve shook.Seven black lights shot out, and stopped in mid-air. They were the seven Star Moon Treasured Mirrors that he had refined using Yin Chen Stones, and they were arranged according to the shape of the Big Dipper.Han Li made a hand seal with both hands, and rays of light fell on the seven treasured mirrors.The Star Moon Treasured Mirrors immediately began to spin, and it emitted a dazzling starlight. Many black runes flew out from it, and they danced in the starlight.His hand seal changed, and the Star Moon Treasured Mirrors let out a low hum, and the light they emitted became brighter and brighter. However, they trembled incessantly, and they became more and more unstable.\"Explode!\"Han Li let loose a soft cry and made an incantation gesture.Bang, bang, bang!The seven treasured mirrors suddenly brightened, and all of them exploded, turning into seven huge balls of light.Han Li's face tightened, and his two hands quickly made a hand seal.Under his control, the seven balls of light quickly condensed, and a moment later, they turned into seven huge illusory stars. They looked like the Big Dipper.When Han Li saw this, he changed his incantation seal.The light of the seven illusory stars suddenly connected with each other, and faintly formed a Star Array.Han Li shouted, and his two hands made a strange hand seal.Chi!The Star Array suddenly lit up, and then, as if it was being pulled by two large hands, it tore apart to the sides. A pitch-black crack appeared, and it emitted a deep black light.But in the deepest part of the darkness, a faint light could be seen.\u2026In the sky above the Realm Star Gathering Platform, the huge silver moon violently fluctuated, and a spatial crack suddenly split open somewhere in the middle. An azure figure shot out from it, and floated in the air. It was Han Li.At this time, with the Realm Star Gathering Platform as the center, the restriction formation that covered a radius of a hundred kilometers was still there. The huge silver moon sprinkled down bright silver clouds, and the rainbow light screen that enveloped the surroundings intertwined with each other, illuminating the space inside into a strange and motley world.And Taoist He Shan, who had already escaped, was nowhere to be seen.Han Li's figure flickered, and he appeared in front of a light screen. He punched out three times in a row, blasting a hole in the light screen, and then flew out, arriving outside the light screen.Outside, everything in the Realm Star Gathering Platform was quiet, submerged in the night, and there was no change.Han Li frowned slightly, and after releasing his divine sense, he suddenly turned his head, and looked coldly at the distant Heaven Shocking Peak.The next moment, his figure turned into a streak of azure light, shooting in that direction like lightning.Just at this time, something strange happened!The ground around Heaven Shocking Peak suddenly shook, and dozens of thick yellow pillars of light emerged from the ground. Each pillar was four to five meters thick, and they towered into the clouds.The pillars of light were covered in earthy yellow spirit patterns, and they emitted vast waves of spiritual power.The pillars of light suddenly lit up at the same time, emitting a thick yellow light. They connected with each other, forming a thick earthy yellow light screen. From afar, it looked like a huge yellow cloud, enveloping the entire Heaven Shocking Peak.In the main hall of Heaven Shocking Peak, there was a three-tiered jade platform, completely cast from a sparkling yellow crystal.The area decreased from the bottom to the top, and the bottom layer was over a hundred meters wide, while the top layer was only two or three meters wide. It was covered in yellow runes.Dozens of earthy yellow jade pillars stood around the jade platform, and they were also densely inscribed with countless runes.Taoist He Shan was there, sitting cross-legged on the third layer of the jade platform. Although his expression was calm, the trace of panic in the depths of his eyes betrayed his true thoughts.He muttered an incantation, and his ten fingers moved like a wheel, quickly striking out one incantation gesture after another.The three-tiered jade platform and the dozens of jade pillars around it immediately flickered with bright earthy yellow light, echoing with the formation outside.The seven or eight Body Integration cultivators in the Realm Star Gathering Platform also sat cross-legged on the second layer of the jade platform. They also muttered an incantation, and their magic power was injected into the jade platform.Outside Heaven Shocking Peak, an azure streak of light pierced through the air and stopped outside the formation in a flash, revealing Han Li's figure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe giant golden-furred ape pounded its chest with both hands, and an extremely violent aura immediately erupted forth, causing the nearby yellow cloud formation to tumble violently.Within the Heaven Shocking Peak hall, everyone in the Realm Origin Temple, including Daoist He Shan, were shocked to see such a monstrous and terrifying giant ape through the yellow cloud light barrier.Daoist He Shan's forehead was slightly beaded with sweat, and he pointed at the jade pillars around him in succession as he began to chant an incantation in a hurry.The surface of all of the jade pillars shone with yellow light, and the yellow light barrier around the peak suddenly thickened and became even more solid.The giant golden-furred ape raised its head and let out a long howl, then fiercely punched forward with its furry fist.Dazzling golden light erupted from the giant fist, and the entire fist swept through the air with tremendous force, stirring up a misty golden hurricane, and fiercely bombarded the yellow cloud light barrier.An earth-shattering boom rang out!Golden and yellow light suddenly erupted, as if two blazing suns, one gold and one yellow, were fiercely colliding, releasing a light that no one dared to look directly at.The surface of the light barrier trembled violently, and the place where it was struck caved in, emitting a crackling sound of tearing. Spiderweb cracks appeared around it, and they quickly spread into the surroundings.Within the Heaven Shocking Peak hall, the three-tiered jade platform and all of the jade pillars around it trembled violently. The jade platform trembled violently, and some cracks even appeared on the steps.All of the Body Integration cultivators in the surroundings felt their dantians tremble violently along with the jade platform, and they all threw up mouthfuls of blood, no longer able to maintain their calm expressions.The Heaven Leading Earth Formation that enveloped the Heaven Shocking Peak was set up countless years ago by several formation masters under the guidance of the Clarity Patriarch, and it took them an entire century to set up. Just now, it had almost been destroyed by a single punch.Daoist He Shan's body trembled, and his expression twisted slightly.\"All of you, hold on!\"A hint of panic flashed through his eyes, but he gritted his teeth and abruptly spat out a mouthful of blood essence, which turned into a blood cloud that fused into a nearby jade pillar. At the same time, he quickly made a hand seal, and the magic power within his body surged into the jade platform.When the surrounding Body Integration cultivators saw this, they also hurriedly followed suit.Within the formation, several tens of huge pillars of light abruptly lit up, and layers of yellow scale-like clouds appeared. The cracks created by the giant golden-furred ape quickly began to heal.The giant golden-furred ape let out a cold snort, and his other arm also shone with brilliant golden light before fiercely crashing down.Boom!The huge golden fist landed on the same spot as before. Waves of golden air rose from the fist, sweeping out in all directions like a gale, as if it could devour everything in its path.The great formation shook violently, and the yellow clouds on its surface churned violently. Yellow pillars of Qi rose up and shot out in all directions in a chaotic manner.The formation light barrier suddenly caved in to twice its original size, and the cracks spread even deeper.Finally, there was a loud sound, and, and and, and the formation completely collapsed.The great hall of Shocking Sky Peak shook violently, and a crack appeared on the three-tiered jade platform, splitting the entire jade platform into two.Daoist He Shan's face also paled, and he suddenly stood up.Just as he was about to do something, a loud sound rang out, and countless cracks appeared on the roof of the hall, which had been reinforced with formation restrictions, before it shattered and collapsed.A golden fist the size of a house descended from the sky, and struck toward Daoist He Shan's head.A buzzing sound rang out!With a flip of his hand, Daoist He Shan summoned a silver horsetail whisk, and with a wave, countless silver threads shot out.He made a hand seal with one hand, and the silver threads that filled the sky immediately gathered together, forming a silver Qilin projection that collided with the golden fist.An earth-shattering sound rang out, and golden and silver light intertwined, forming a gust of wind that rushed into the sky, and swept out in all directions.The entire hall was completely shattered, and the Body Integration cultivators were also sent flying by the gust of wind. Fortunately, they reacted extremely quickly, and all of them frantically summoned their various magic treasures to protect themselves, so they didn't suffer too many injuries.A plump figure staggered out of the gust of wind. It was Daoist He Shan, and he held half a horsetail whisk in his hand. A hint of fear flashed through the depths of his eyes, and he hurriedly called out.\"Please wait, Friend Han...\"Before he could finish his sentence, a golden shadow flashed, and the giant golden ape appeared in front of him like a ghost. A massive golden palm that was the size of a house came crashing down.The gigantic palm seemed to move slowly, but it was fast at times. A terrifying force that seemed to be able to crush the entire void arrived with a loud rumble, and a series of explosions rang out in the void.Daoist He Shan was greatly alarmed, and he opened his mouth to expel a ball of white light, which was an ancient black inkstone.There was faint light flowing on the surface of the inkstone, and it was clear that it was a sturdy treasure of a high grade.The inkstone rotated in the air, and it swelled in the wind. Countless runes surfaced from within it, and at the same time, a thick pillar of black light rushed out from within to block the giant golden palm.He took advantage of this opportunity to hurriedly flee into the distance. At the same time, white light flashed in his hand, and a white jade scepter appeared in his hand.The giant golden ape let out a low roar, and the palm that was blocked by the black pillar of light opened its five fingers. Golden spirit inscriptions appeared on the palm.In an instant, a force that was two or three times stronger than before suddenly erupted from the giant palm, and it easily crushed the black pillar of light. Then, it grabbed the black inkstone and gripped it with force.The inkstone was actually crushed with a \"bang\"!After that, his body blurred, and he immediately appeared not far behind Daoist He Shan. A golden hairy hand reached out like lightning, and the golden spirit inscriptions on its surface suddenly lit up. Immediately, a golden wave of air swept forward.Daoist He Shan suddenly turned around and waved his arm fiercely.With a flash of white light, the white jade scepter was thrown up. The red, yellow, and blue light on its surface rotated, and a three-colored mixed spirit flame soared into the sky. It condensed in the middle, and in the blink of an eye, it turned into a three-colored phoenix that was more than 100 feet in size, and it pounced toward the giant ape's fist.An extremely dazzling three-colored light burst out from the phoenix, illuminating half of the sky. At this moment, everything in the surroundings was overshadowed.Rumble!An earth-shattering noise came from mid-air, and it instantly resounded through the entire Realm Origin Temple. It caused all the disciples in Daoist robes to fly out of various buildings in shock. After a commotion, they all looked toward the direction of the Sky Shocking Peak with different expressions.At this moment, the entire sky was divided into two. One side was golden light, and the other side was red, yellow, and blue light. They collided with each other and continued to make muffled thunderous noises.The Sky Shocking Peak and the ground within a thousand miles around it shook violently. Gusts of hurricanes appeared out of thin air and spread toward the surroundings.All the trees near the Sky Shocking Peak were uprooted, and some boulders were also swept away by the violent wind. The ground was almost peeled off, and it was smashed into pieces.The confrontation between the two terrifying forces only lasted for a few breaths. The golden light quickly overwhelmed the three-colored spirit light on the other side, and it was completely crushed.The three-colored fire phoenix let out a mournful cry, and its figure was crushed by the golden light. It completely collapsed.Daoist He Shan's body was sent flying by the astonishing wave of air, and the emerald ruyi in his hand also exploded with a bang.He flew several miles away, and crashed heavily into a mountain peak. Then, along with the sky full of rubble, he fell to the ground.Boom!The huge golden ape's body fell from the sky, and it landed not far in front of Daoist He Shan. The ground shook violently, and rubble flew everywhere. A pair of giant feet had stomped out two large pits.The giant ape lowered its head, and its cold golden eyes looked at the fat figure on the ground.\"Friend Han, no \u2026 Senior Han, please listen to my explanation. It's not what you think!\"Daoist He Shan was scared out of his wits. Seeing that the giant ape did not immediately kill him, he hurriedly spoke.At this moment, he was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he would have immediately fled the Realm Temple after escaping from the cave. That way, he might have had a chance of survival.At this moment, something strange happened!Several consecutive loud booms came from the distant sky. It came from the direction of the Star Gathering Platform.The golden ape raised an eyebrow, and turned to look.Daoist He Shan's heart trembled, and he also hurriedly looked in the direction of the Star Gathering Platform.He saw the eight mountains near the Star Gathering Platform rumble and sway, and the peaks directly exploded and collapsed. The eight pillars of light that soared up above them disappeared in a flash.The huge barrier of light that enveloped the Star Gathering Platform suddenly brightened, and then collapsed.However, not only did the huge silver moon above the Star Gathering Platform not disappear, it instead blossomed with light even more dazzling than the sun, and suddenly began to tremble.Invisible waves of air swept in all directions, and the space within a radius of several hundred miles began to tremble again. Trees shattered, and mountains collapsed.Afterwards, the light from the surface of the silver moon gathered at the center, and suddenly spun, turning into an incomparably huge vortex. The surrounding area was sometimes scarlet red, sometimes dark blue. Various colors of light appeared one after another, and there were even several kinds of light that flickered and interweaved, causing the space to tremble violently.The surrounding disciples of the Realm Temple all stared at the strange phenomenon in the sky, and they fell into absolute silence.The golden ape gazed at the huge vortex in the sky, and blue light flickered in his eyes. Suddenly, he waved his hand, and a huge suction force appeared.\"Spare me \u2026\"Daoist He Shan shouted loudly, and wanted to struggle, but he was still easily sucked into the giant ape's palm without any resistance.The giant ape opened his mouth, and a silver firebird shot out. It was the Essence Flame Firebird, and with a flash, it turned into a rope of silver flames, wrapping around Daoist He Shan's body a few times at lightning speed.Afterwards, he waved his hand, and threw Daoist He Shan away. He then turned to look at the spatial vortex in the sky again, and a serious expression appeared on his face.Daoist He Shan was heavily smashed into the ground, and he immediately saw stars.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the sky, the whirlpool on the surface of the silver giant moon had doubled in size compared with before.In the deepest part of the whirlpool, a layer of translucent crystal wall could be vaguely seen. Behind it was a vast expanse of whiteness as if it was another unknown world.Suddenly, the layer of crystal wall flashed as if it was hit by something from the other side.Boom!The silver giant moon trembled slightly, and the surface of the layer of crystal wall in the whirlpool actually tore open a gap.\"Swoosh\".A cluster of dazzling yellow light flew out from it and fell down rapidly.The layer of crystal wall was instantly healed. As the whirlpool suddenly began to shrink, it could no longer be seen.\"That is \u2026\"The eyes of the giant golden ape that Han Li transformed into flashed blue light, and he immediately saw the thing wrapped in the yellow light clearly.Shockingly, it was a glistening yellow bean. Its appearance was extremely similar to those little yellow beans that Duan Renli had released from the bottle gourd earlier, but it was much larger. Moreover, its surface was inscribed with countless profound talisman markings.The bean suddenly paused in mid-air before rotating on the spot, upon which countless golden runes surged forth in a frenzy. The runes revolved around the bean, and countless streaks of yellow light shot forth from within. The surrounding area within a radius of over 100 feet instantly became shimmering with golden light, and it was as if a golden pond were hovering in mid-air.Then, with a crisp sound, the bean swelled at an incredible speed as if it was germinating. It grew a head and limbs.One meter, a hundred meters, a hundred meters, a thousand meters \u2026Almost in a breath's time, the yellow bean that was originally only the size of a walnut had turned into a yellow turban giant that was more than two thousand meters tall. Its whole body exuded a cluster of golden light that seemed to be substantial.This giant looked similar to the previous yellow turban strongman. Its upper body was naked, and its waist was wrapped with a yellow turban. It was unarmed, but the muscles on its arms and thighs were bulging as if they were made of steel. It gave people a strong sense of oppression.In the next moment, the surface of the silver moon trembled again, and countless yellow dots began to shoot out densely from it. They were the soybeans that had been left in the grotto-heaven, and they rained down like a storm.A strange scene appeared.As soon as the yellow beans touched the golden light emitted by the Yellow Turban Giant, they were all swept up by some kind of suction force.Every bean that landed on the surface of the giant's body would silently sink into it, causing the giant's body to grow a little taller.As a result, when the tens of thousands of soybeans were all absorbed by the giant's body, its body also skyrocketed all the way to about ten thousand feet tall. It stood towering between the heavens and the earth, causing the nearby mountains to seem to shrink a little.An indescribably powerful aura emanated from his body and swept out in all directions.\"Ah!What \u2026 what is this? \"\"This is too huge!\"\"They don't come with good intentions. I think I just saw the Great Supreme Elder lose to that golden-furred ape. Why did this one suddenly appear \u2026\"\"What's the use of saying all this now? It's more important to run for our lives!\"When the disciples of the temple thousands of miles away saw this scene, they were naturally scared out of their wits. Immediately, many people didn't care about anything else and scattered in all directions.But there were also many people who were bold and thought that there was no danger from watching from afar, so they stayed. Naturally, some of them were at the Void Refinement Stage and even the Body Integration Stage, but they had different expressions on their faces.At this time, the huge silver moon in the air flashed and began to shrink rapidly. After a while, it turned into a dim silver disk of more than 100 meters in size. Then the silver disk peeled off like a silver-white scroll in the starry sky, falling down, and burning on the way.The starlight that was originally obscured by the surrounding starlight flashed again, and it flashed constantly.The golden-furred ape ignored the changes of the silver giant moon. From the beginning to the end, his eyes had been staring at the Yellow Turban Giant standing in mid-air.If he guessed correctly, the soybean that transformed into the Yellow Turban Giant was very likely to come from the Immortal Realm.It was even related to the three Perfected Immortal ancestors of the Tengui School.This was a bit thought-provoking.Han Li's thoughts surged like the tide of a raging sea.At this moment, the face of the Yellow Turban Giant fluctuated slightly. A pale-yellow face phantasm appeared faintly. It looked at the golden-furred ape coldly, and its huge figure suddenly rushed straight like a meteorite. In a flash, it appeared in front of the giant ape. It raised its right arm, and a huge golden fist punched straight at it.A yellow air wave spread out like a wave. Wherever the air wave passed, the surrounding mountains and trees burst like bubbles.The golden-haired ape let out a loud shout, and his body quickly grew to a hundred feet. Silver light blossomed on his arms, and countless silver spirit patterns appeared. They gathered into layers of silver inscriptions that covered his entire arms, and a terrifying force was suddenly emitted.With a loud shout, it also blasted out a punch.A misty silver hurricane swept out from his arm!One silver and one golden, two fists of different sizes collided with a loud bang.An earth-shattering loud noise!The two golden lights suddenly flourished, and then they burst apart. The nearby void twisted and trembled, making a buzzing sound.The golden-furred ape's body shook violently, and the silver light on its arm shattered with a loud bang. Its 1,000-meter-tall body was sent flying, and with several bangs, it smashed through three or four small mountains along the way. In the end, it crashed into the mountainside of a mountain that was over 10,000 meters tall, and its body sank over 100 meters into the mountain wall before it barely came to a stop.The giant mountain trembled violently, and countless gravel fell like rain, almost collapsing from the impact. As for the pavilions and pavilions on the mountainside, and even the abode and herb garden, they were directly turned into a pile of broken walls and ruins under the tremendous force.The golden-furred ape flew out of the mountain wall and shook off the dust on his body. There was no trace of injury on his body, but a trace of horror flashed in his eyes.Although he couldn't fully exert the full power of the giant mountain ape because of the shallow spiritual power in his body, the power of the Yellow Turban Giant in front of him was really terrifying. Even he had a feeling that he couldn't match it.\"Boom\"!More than ten miles away, the Yellow Turban Giant's flying momentum stopped, and its feet landed heavily on the ground below, causing the earth to rumble.Then it slightly bent down on one knee and bowed slightly.\"Boom\"!There was a loud explosion in the void, and circles of visible ripples spread out. The Yellow Turban Giant rushed toward the golden-furred ape like a meteor. In the blink of an eye, it reached the top of the ape's head, and two golden giant hands suddenly grabbed down.Although the giant ape that Han Li transformed into was a little surprised by the opponent's speed, he didn't panic. A large green light suddenly emerged from his body, and he rolled on the ground, turning into a 400 to 500 meters tall divine bird.On the head of the phoenix crown and a long green tail, it was the transformation of the Green Luan!The Green Luan spread its wings and disappeared without a trace, making the Yellow Turban Giant miss its target.\"Rumble\", a loud noise resounded through the world!The Yellow Turban Giant couldn't stop its momentum, and the two golden giant hands grabbed the giant mountain behind the original position of the giant ape. The giant mountain was actually cut off from the mountainside.The several-thousand-feet-long chunk of rock smashed down and crushed the other two mountains behind it, causing the earth to quake and the mountains to tremble in a radius of several hundred kilometers.\"Whoosh\"!A green shadow flashed behind the Yellow Turban Giant, and the figure of Green Luan appeared out of thin air. Its two huge claws were wrapped in green light, and it fiercely grabbed the back of the Yellow Turban Giant.Chi la!A few long wounds were left on the back of the Yellow Turban Giant, but they weren't deep. For such a huge body, the wounds were almost negligible.The Yellow Turban Giant seemed to be slow, but it was actually very fast.A violent force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas swept out, and a series of explosions rang out in the void.Green Luan flapped its wings, and its figure turned into a green shadow and disappeared again. The next moment, it appeared in front of the Yellow Turban Giant, and it flapped its wings fiercely.Hundreds of feathers flew out, and they turned into green wind blades of more than 100 meters in size. The edge of each wind blade was flashing with a sharp light, and it quickly slashed the Yellow Turban Giant.Chi la!There were wounds on the chest and abdomen of the Yellow Turban Giant, and it was furious. It quickly turned its head and waved its arms wildly, but it only hit the afterimage of Green Luan, causing bursts of invisible airwaves.Under the flickering light in Green Luan's eyes, its figure suddenly turned into a series of blurred afterimages, surrounding the Yellow Turban Giant in the middle, looking for another opportunity to attack.The Yellow Turban Giant's enormous strength was simply incredible. Fortunately, its defense was not outstanding, so Green Luan's attack could still hurt it. Although the injury seemed to be a little insignificant, it could still threaten the Yellow Turban Giant.At this moment, the chest of the Yellow Turban Giant suddenly flashed, and a mysterious yellow light emerged, quickly spreading to his whole body.His back and chest healed quickly in the yellow light, and they disappeared in a few seconds.Seeing this scene, Green Luan was suddenly stunned.Then it squinted its eyes and let out a screech. Its speed was raised to the extreme, flying up and down around the Yellow Turban Giant. From time to time, it launched a series of fierce wind attribute attacks.Although the Yellow Turban Giant was powerful, its speed was far less than Green Luan's speed. It waved its hands wildly, but it couldn't even touch the Yellow Turban Giant's shadow, but it caused the mountains within a hundred miles to suffer a disaster. The small mountain of more than a thousand meters was directly crushed by its foot, and the taller mountain also collapsed directly under its punch.A green shadow circled around the Yellow Turban Giant's body, and its body was soon covered with bruises.However, a trace of yellow light appeared on the Yellow Turban Giant's chest. No matter what kind of injury, it could be healed in a few seconds.Not only that, the Yellow Turban Giant's movements gradually became more agile. It seemed to have mastered the trajectory of Green Luan's movement technique, and it could gradually catch up with Green Luan's ghostly speed.The 2 kept moving the battlefield. The mountains in the Realm Spiritual Temple collapsed one after another, and countless buildings collapsed.For a time, the roars in the Realm Spiritual Temple rose one after another, and smoke and dust rose everywhere. Seeing this, the high-grade cultivators who had already fled far away could not help but be frightened. They immediately fled in all directions without daring to stay any longer.Lying on the ground, Daoist He Shan watched helplessly as the huge sect became a blind ruin in the blink of an eye. He could not help but feel like his heart was dripping blood.If this continued, the million years of foundation would be destroyed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA deafening roar resounded!Under the golden light, a gigantic yellow palm that was several acres in size descended from the sky and slammed towards a blurry green shadow. However, the green shadow was extremely fast. It twisted in an extremely strange way and narrowly dodged the gigantic palm.Boom!The giant palm smashed on a mountain peak like a mountain.After an earth-shattering boom, the entire mountain completely exploded and collapsed.The green shadow flashed, and it instantly went to the back of the giant's right arm that was connected to the giant palm. The feather crown on its head shone in green light, and its body exuded dazzling green light. It gathered on a pair of sharp claws and slashed down fiercely.\"Chi Chi\", a whistling sound came out!Dozens of green claw lights formed a large green net, grabbing at the giant's right arm. Wherever it passed, the void was easily cut open, leaving crisscrossing pitch-black marks.The giant raised its head, but its right arm was still in the process of retracting. It seemed that it had no time to dodge.A series of loud metal collision sounds, and the green and golden lights suddenly burst out between the green claw net and the giant's right arm, but it was just a flash. The claw lights only paused for a moment, then the golden light was torn apart like a piece of paper.After a \"puchi\", the giant's right arm was easily cut off like tofu in front of the green claw net.Han Li's eyes flashed with joy, but at this moment, a sudden change happened!Suddenly, the golden spirit runes on the surface of the severed arm shone brightly and burst apart in an instant. A large expanse of yellow mist spread and turned into a huge yellow cloud that covered an area of tens of acres.Although the green phoenix flapped its wings and fled as soon as it realized something was wrong, it was still wrapped in it because the cloud was too huge.It only felt that the surrounding air was suddenly tight, and its body suddenly became extremely sluggish.Amidst the dark-yellow mist that filled the surroundings, there were many thin yellow threads that bound its body and limbs.The green phoenix let out a clear chirp. As it was about to flap its wings to struggle, the yellow filaments just trembled slightly, and countless yellow runes surged out.It suddenly felt that the surrounding space was heavy again. Its whole body seemed to be pressed by a giant mountain, and it was quite difficult to move.But in the next moment, a large area of silver flames suddenly sprang out from his body and enveloped his entire body.Amidst the sizzling sounds, the yellow threads were continuously melted and dispersed. However, there were still countless yellow threads that swarmed over from all directions, and they once again firmly bound him.However, in this way, the Green Luan finally obtained a trace of movement under the continuous collapse and convergence of these fine threads.Just as blue light flashed through his eyes, and he was trying to find a way to escape, the surrounding space suddenly dimmed, and a burst of invisible power descended upon him.\"Not good!\" Han Li cried in his heart.Immediately after, an incomparably huge palm strangely appeared in the surroundings. It was so close that one could almost see the thick palm lines on the palm. Without saying a word, the palm clenched towards the center.In a moment of desperation, Han Li's body flashed with golden light, and he instantly transformed into a golden-furred Giant Mountain Ape.\"Boom!\"The five fingers of the giant hand suddenly closed, and he was caught in the palm.The golden-furred Giant Ape grimaced for a while. He only felt that waves of invisible giant force were desperately squeezing his body like a mountain, making a loud cracking sound. Fortunately, his physical body was strong, so he could still withstand it for a while.What shocked him was that the refined flame and silver flame had no effect on this giant palm at all.At this time, the mysterious yellow mist that pervaded the surrounding tumbled back, revealing the huge figure of the yellow turban giant not far away. The yellow face on his face showed a hint of a hideous smile, and his left hand was firmly holding the giant ape's body.A little dazzling yellow light flashed a few times on the giant's chest, then an amazing scene appeared.The mysterious yellow mist gathered at the broken wound of his right arm. After a burst of intertwining and tumbling, a brand new arm immediately recovered to its original state. He raised his five fingers into a fist and smashed it at the giant ape's head like a small mountain.Before it landed, the terrifying force contained in the giant fist had already made the space within a radius of nearly a thousand meters roar, and it was suddenly distorted.Seeing this, the giant ape that Han Li transformed into secretly complained in his heart.Even if his physical body was strong, if he was directly hit by such a giant fist, even if he didn't die, he would be seriously injured.\"This is the only way!\"Han Li muttered to himself. He made a gesture in his heart, and his body suddenly emitted a purple light.\"Peng!\"The left fist of the yellow turban giant slammed down, but the next moment, a trace of surprise flashed on his face.His left fist did not smash the head of the giant ape below as expected. Instead, the back of his hand was directly penetrated by a purple rainbow with a \"bang\" sound. The fingers of his other right hand were also twisted as if they were broken.The purple light rolled not far away, and the light faded away, revealing a golden giant ape that was two or three hundred meters tall.Unlike before, this giant ape was covered with countless purple-gold scales, and there was a cyan horn on its head. There were also two giant ape heads and four hairy purple-gold long arms on both sides of its shoulders and ribs.Han Li impressively cast his trump card magical power \"Nirvana Holy Physique\"!The yellow turban giant looked at the six armed giant ape in front of him, and his face became dignified. The injuries on his hands instantly healed, and they began to buzz.A layer of yellow light appeared over his fists, and several massive golden runes flew out from within the runes. The runes rotated on the spot before fusing into his fists in a flash, causing them to swell to around twice their original size in an instant. A burst of terrifying volcanic power began to brew within them, and even though it hadn't erupted yet, the resulting shockwaves had already caused the nearby space to tremor and buzz.After the transformed six armed giant ape saw this scene, he let out a long roar. He took a step and came to the front of the yellow turban giant. \"Hu hu\", he punched twice, and the fists shone with purple-gold light.Seeing this, the yellow turban giant did not hesitate to wave his fists.Boom!The four fists collided with a loud noise. The nearby space suddenly buzzed loudly, and a vast distance suddenly rippled!This time, the six armed giant ape's body remained motionless, but the yellow turban giant's body was sent flying.Not only that, but the surface of his two fists was badly mutilated, and his two arms were bent at a strange angle, completely broken.The giant's eyes were full of disbelief, and his huge body flew back a few hundred meters, slamming into a mountain peak.Boom!The mountain peak was directly smashed like a piece of paper.The yellow turban giant did not stop flying back, and he continued to fly backward, knocking down several mountains in succession, and barely managed to stabilize his body.But at this moment, a purple-gold light flashed, and the six armed giant ape chased after him like a shadow.The yellow turban giant was startled, but he did not panic. A large amount of yellow light continuously gushed out from his chest, quickly spreading to his broken arms, and quickly healing the injuries there. At the same time, his right leg swept out like a giant knife, slashing at the waist of the giant ape.A huge surging force surged out, setting off a thick white wave in the air.The six armed giant ape's figure suddenly shrank, and with an extremely ugly roll, it dodged the giant's kick. Then, its figure immediately shot out, and fiercely slammed into the giant's body. The two purple-gold arms at the bottom fiercely grabbed the giant's body, and once again slammed into it.The yellow turban giant was shocked, and his body shone with yellow light. He raised his arm that had not yet recovered, and struggled with all his might.As a result, the giant ape's middle two arms stretched out, and like steel hoops, grabbed the giant's arms, and with a crack, broke them again. At the same time, the two uppermost arms flashed with a purple-gold light, and impressively a layer of metallic luster appeared, and fiercely slammed into the giant's chest.Puchi!The two arms impressively penetrated the giant's body, and for a moment, the yellow turban giant's movements suddenly stopped, and the light in his eyes quickly dimmed. The recovery of his arms also stopped.The yellow face shadow on his face showed a furious expression, and with a \"pa\" sound, it shattered and disappeared.Han Li's two arms shook, and he pulled them out of the yellow turban giant's body. In one of his hands, there was a yellow bean that emitted a dazzling light.The yellow turban giant's body trembled, and as Han Li pulled his arms out, all the golden light on its body dissipated. After subconsciously taking a few steps back, countless cracks appeared on the surface of its huge body, and then it quickly shattered, turning into a large cloud of yellow smoke, and dissipated with the wind.Almost at the same time, the momentum of the six armed giant ape plummeted, and with a flash of purple-gold light, it turned back into a human form, and its face was extremely pale.He quickly flipped his hand, took out a cloud crane grass, and swallowed it. Only then did his complexion look a little better.Looking at the yellow smoke gradually dissipating in front of him, Han Li let out a long breath, and a trace of rejoicing flashed in his eyes.Although this yellow turban giant did not know any spells, its physical body was extremely strong, and its great strength was probably not inferior to the so-called Xuan Immortal. If he did not use the Nirvana transformation, he would not be its opponent at all.However, this technique not only required a strong physical body, but also consumed a large amount of spiritual power. With his current spiritual power, it was not enough to support it at all.Speaking of which, this was all thanks to the completion of the sixth level of the Little Big Dipper Yuan Gong. The Five Reserve Yuan Gong, which originally needed to absorb a large amount of spiritual energy from heaven and earth, had recovered some power, so that his internal organs could also store some spiritual power.Although this required ten times the congenital purple energy, and it was not cost-effective, when he discovered the abnormal behavior of the Jing Yuan Gong, he did not hesitate to swallow almost all the cloud crane grass on his body.Even so, it was barely enough to support for a few seconds, and its power was still not at its peak.Fortunately, the yellow turban giant did not react in time. If the other party saw him transform and immediately turned to escape, as long as he bought a little time, the one who died at this moment would be him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked like a fiend that wanted to devour someone.The latter's expression was not much better. After a while, he said slowly, \"I wonder who this person is. Not only can my Spirit Nascent Talisman Sword do nothing to him, even you, Brother Yan \u2026\"At this point, he let out a sigh and did not continue speaking.\"I really did not expect that a Yellow Turban Dao General like me, whose strength is close to the level of a Xuan Immortal, would be defeated by a mere Fallen Immortal!\" Boneflame Sanren's face was full of pain, then he gritted his teeth.This time, he did not hesitate to break through the power of the world and forcefully opened a passage to send down a female bean. In the end, he lost contact with the bean not long after. He was so pained that he wanted to vomit blood.\"It seems that either the information from Ten Directions Tower is wrong, or this Han Li had some special opportunity and recovered his strength.But if that's the case, our two sects in the lower realm will probably be in trouble. We have to think of a solution as soon as possible, \"Spiritual Master Clarity's eyes flashed as he said in a low voice.\"Hmph, this matter will not be settled so easily!\" Boneflame Sanren's eyes became even darker.\u2026Spirit Huan World, inside the Realm Origin Temple.Daoist He Shan looked at the expressionless Han Li who was walking towards him step by step. His body could not help but tighten, and the fat on his body began to tremble slightly.If he was not trapped by the restriction, perhaps he would have long escaped like those elders and disciples. In fact, he might have escaped even faster than them.Han Li stopped in front of him and stared at him expressionlessly for a while. Suddenly, he raised his arm and pointed at the center of Daoist He Shan's brows.\"Senior Han, spare my life!I was only following orders. I really had no choice. \"Daoist He Shan's back was drenched in cold sweat as he cried out rapidly.\"Oh?Tell me, whose order was it? \"Han Li raised his eyebrows, stopped what he was doing, and asked with a faint smile.\"Everything that happened here was done under the orders of the ancestor of the upper realm. Otherwise, how would I dare to do such a rebellious thing?\" Taoist He Shan answered without even thinking.\"Why did your Great Ancestor give such an order? Could it be that he knows me?\" Han Li continued to ask.\"This \u2026 According to the Ancestral Master, there's a huge secret organization in the Immortal Dimension that has issued a bounty for you, Senior. The bounty is so high that it's not something a small cultivator from the lower realms like me can imagine.After the Tengui School's Bone Flame Ancestor received the bounty, he came to persuade and tempt our Ancestor. That's why \u2026 he acted so rudely this time, \"Daoist He Shan's eyes swiveled as he hurriedly answered.\"Rude behavior?You make it sound so easy!Bone Flame Cultivator received the bounty, but didn't your Realm Temple's Spiritual Master Clarity receive it? \"Han Li immediately sneered and mocked.Daoist He Shan's expression froze, but he still answered carefully, \"Perhaps it's a plan that the two Patriarchs came up with together. As their junior, I really don't know the details.Since the Patriarch has given the order, even if I don't want to go against you, Senior, I can only follow it helplessly. \"When Han Li heard this, he did not say anything else. After pondering for a moment, he had a vague guess in his heart.When Daoist He Shan saw that Han Li was silent for a long time, he thought that Han Li was hesitating whether to take his life or not. The fear in his heart grew.He gritted his teeth and said, \"Senior's divine power is unparalleled. I, He Shan, am willing to serve Senior as my master from now on. All materials and pills can be contributed to Senior. In the future, the entire Realm Temple will also serve you as the supreme and be at your command \u2026\"\"Serve me as your master \u2026 You're quite sensible.\" Han Li was slightly taken aback, and he could not help but laugh in his heart.With his personality, since things had come to this, he originally did not plan to spare the other party's life. In the end, before he could even search his soul, the other party had honestly confessed everything. Now, he was even willing to serve him as his master. In this way, he could save a lot of trouble.After all, his original intention was not to cause too much of a disturbance in this small Spirit Huan Domain.But then again, he had met many Mahayana Stage cultivators in the Spirit Realm in the past, but he had never seen one like this Daoist He Shan. He could not help but think of an old friend, \"Sun Ergou\".\"Thank you for your great kindness, Senior!\" Daoist He Shan saw that Han Li did not refuse and immediately called out respectfully.\"I'm not interested in your Realm Temple, and I can't be bothered to occupy your nest. In the future, you only need to listen to my orders and do some things for me.But before that, I need to put some restrictions on you, \"Han Li said with a wave of his hand.After saying that, he raised one of his palms and silently chanted a few words. The tips of his five fingers all lit up with a burst of light. Fine crystal threads extended from his fingertips and drifted in the air leisurely like water plants.As Han Li bent his fingers slightly, the crystal threads immediately became abnormally straight.When Daoist He Shan saw this, his body instantly trembled slightly, and his face also became slightly pale, but he still put on a posture of letting Lin Huang do as he pleased.Some satisfaction flashed across Han Li's eyes. He stretched out his palm, and five crystal threads immediately shot out, piercing straight towards his head.The moment the crystal threads entered his body, Daoist He Shan only felt a piercing pain in his sea of consciousness. He could not help but let out a low and hoarse howl, and his face instantly turned pale.But from beginning to end, he did not resist or struggle at all.\"These translucent threads were manifested from my spiritual sense, and they've already been deeply implanted into your soul. If you dare to harbor any disloyal thoughts in the future, I'll be able to destroy your soul with a single thought. Do you understand?\" Han Li said in a slow voice as he waved a hand to dispel the silver flames on his body.\"Junior understands. In the future, I will definitely do my best to serve you, and will not dare to have any other thoughts!\" Daoist He Shan stood up from the ground and replied with a lowered head.\"There's no need to say anything else to express your loyalty. Tell me, where is the formation that connects the temple to the Realm of Immortals?\" Han Li asked straightforwardly.\"There's one at the back of Heaven's Respect Peak and one at the peak of Bi Mountain. I'll take senior there right now.\" Daoist He Shan answered without hesitation.In the sky, two streaks of light flew up, one after the other, and flew into the distance.Not long after, the area under the jurisdiction of the Realm Temple, which had already returned to silence, suddenly heard two rumbles. They were less than thirty minutes apart.This scene caused many elders and disciples who had just returned to the sect to panic once again. However, when they discovered that there were no other abnormalities apart from these two rumbles, they felt a little more at ease.After all, too many things had happened overnight. Almost a third of the entire Realm Temple had been changed beyond recognition, and the whereabouts of the great elder were unknown. Nothing strange could have happened.About an hour later, two figures, one fat and one thin, flew over from afar on a mountain peak in the depths of the Realm Temple and entered a large hall.At the center of the hall was a white jade platform. There were circles of complicated inscriptions carved on it. It was clearly a formation.\"This is the transportation formation to the Tengui School?\" Han Li asked without turning his head, looking at the formation in front of him.\"Yes.This place is connected to the Tengui School's Black Nightmare Peak. Although we can't directly enter their core area, we're already inside the mountain gate, \"Daoist He Shan immediately answered.\"Just in time. Come with me,\" Han Li said with a smile.\"Yes!\"After saying that, the two of them stepped into the formation. A dazzling white light rose from the ground and engulfed the two of them in an instant.\u2026 \u2026Tengui School, Serene Sacrifice Peak.In a deep and serene hall, a middle-aged man dressed in a red brocade robe was sitting on the main seat. He had a pair of peach blossom eyes, soft cheeks, and sickly snow-white skin. He looked rather feminine and beautiful.However, the expression on his face was extremely unsightly at the moment. He gripped the armrest of the chair beneath him and said in a low, hoarse voice, \"Half a day ago, the soul tablets of the two great elders of the Spirit Hall shattered one after another. We contacted them through a secret technique, but there was no response at all.What do you think about this? \"Although there were more than ten people sitting on the left and right sides of the hall, all of them were at the Body Integration Stage. At this moment, all of them had solemn expressions and were silent.The hall fell into a dead silence.After a long period of silence, a curly bearded burly man finally couldn't help but stand up and say, \"Sect Master, there must be something wrong with the Soul Tablet. Grand Elder Tong is the number one cultivator in the Spirit Circle. Who in this world is capable of causing him to perish?\"\"Yes, there must be a mistake somewhere \u2026\" Someone in the hall immediately agreed.\"Elder Fu, soul tablets are refined from a cultivator's soul and blood essence, supplemented by a secret technique. Has there ever been a mistake in the past tens of thousands of years?\" A beautiful woman in a red gauze dress stood up and asked with a frown.The curly-bearded man was stunned. He opened his mouth to retort, but he didn't know what to say.\"There's no mistake with the soul tablets, but Great Elder Tong and Great Elder Tong wouldn't die so easily. Could they be trapped by some special formation that cut off their connection with the soul tablets?\" A hunchbacked old man among the elders also said.\"Sect Master, no matter what happened, the two Great Elders went to the Realm Origin Temple and there's no news from them now. Just in case, we should open all the defensive restrictions in the sect and contact the patriarchs of the Upper Realm as soon as possible.\"A middle-aged man with a square face and a short purple beard stood up and said to the red-robed man on the main seat.The man released the hand that was rubbing between his eyebrows and said, \"I have the same intention. I'll leave the opening of the restrictions to you, Elder Lu. As for the patriarchs, I'll \u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, he heard a loud \"rumble\", and the entire hall suddenly shook along with it.\"What's going on?\"Everyone was shocked. More than ten rays of light flashed at the same time and directly arrived at the square outside the hall.At this moment, in the sky outside the hall, a black screen of light that covered a radius of several hundred miles appeared. It was the Sect Guarding Formation of the Tengui School.The dozens of mountain peaks that were enveloped by the light screen were the core area of the entire Tengui School. Almost all the important places of the sect were on these mountain peaks.On the black light screen, dim light floated everywhere and runes trembled. It seemed extremely unstable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Boom!\" \"Boom!\" Two loud sounds rang out.As the giant golden-furred ape's fist smashed down, a series of ripples appeared on the black light barrier. There were two obvious deep depressions where the golden ape's fist had struck, and it even let out a shrill squeaking sound.\"Where did this beast come from? What terrifying strength!\"\"This ape seems to be quite similar to the legendary Giant Mountain Ape; could it be...\"\"In any case, this audacious bastard dares to wreak havoc in our Tengui School! We have to take him down as a warning to others!\"The seven or eight Body Integration cultivators, led by Elder Fu, faltered slightly at the sight of the giant golden ape outside the formation. Various speculations then appeared on their faces before they all summoned their treasures and flew toward the giant ape.Elder Lu was just about to fly toward the ape when a peculiar light suddenly flashed through his eyes, and he stopped in his tracks. Aside from the Tengui School Sect Master, there was also a hunchbacked elderly man, a beautiful woman, and a one-eyed burly man.These four were none other than the ones who had attacked Han Li with the Nine Heavens Devilish Flames in the Demonic Flame Valley. At this moment, they exchanged a glance, and all of them could see a hint of astonishment in one another's eyes.At the same time, countless streaks of light appeared on all of the mountain peaks in the Tengui School. Almost all of the elders and disciples had flown out of their residences before landing on the nearby mountain peaks or plaza to appraise the situation.The giant golden ape paid no heed to the oncoming cultivators, and not only did it not stop, it let loose an enraged roar as golden light flashed from its fists, and it unleashed a frenzied barrage of punches toward the black light barrier.An earth-shattering boom rang out!The black light barrier tremored violently before twisting and warping, and it immediately began to shatter amid a tearing sound.The giant ape's massive body abruptly passed through the shattered formation before plummeting toward the summit of a mountain. At this moment, the Body Integration Stage elders from the Serene Sacrifice Peak had also caught up to it.Elder Fu let loose an enraged roar, and crimson mist immediately surged out of his body, enshrouding his entire body before quickly transforming into a giant crimson-armored ghost that was around 500 to 600 feet tall.He held a bloodied mountain-splitting axe in his hands and swung it down at the ape's head.Blood-colored vortexes appeared on both sides of the giant axe, emitting a powerful suction force that seemed to be able to pull everything in the surroundings towards the axe's edge.Following closely behind the crimson giant were several Ghost Dao treasures of different colors and shapes. They were either accompanied by surging black fog or a surging blood river. They covered most of the sky as they pounced towards the giant ape with a ferocious aura.In an instant, gloomy winds howled furiously in the sky, and the smell of blood was dense. It was like a myriad of ghosts were wailing, and the sounds of ghosts demanding their lives rose and fell, causing the temperature in the surrounding area of a few hundred meters to drop abruptly.The golden-furred giant ape let out a low snort from its nostrils. Without slowing down its descent, it raised an arm high and slapped the blood river and ghostly mist down below.\"Hula!\"An indescribably powerful airwave, like a hundred-meter-tall wall, pushed downwards with an unstoppable force.The blood-armored giant that Elder Fu had transformed into bore the brunt of the impact. The crimson axe smashed into the airwave with a loud rumble. It didn't have the slightest bit of delay, and it directly collapsed.Immediately after, its huge body seemed to have collided with a boulder. First, half of its body collapsed, and then its entire body turned into a mass of blood light, and directly exploded.The gloomy clouds and blood mist behind it hadn't even come into contact with the airwave, and most of them were blown away by an invisible force. The bone swords, skeletons, blood rings, and other magic treasures that were hidden within it all exploded like firecrackers, without exception, and turned into powder.A series of mournful cries resounded continuously in the air. Several figures spouted blood as their Natal Magic Treasures were destroyed, and they fell from the air.The rest of the people were also shocked, and they hurriedly fled in the opposite direction.The next moment, the huge body of the golden ape fell straight from a high place like a meteorite, and heavily smashed into a mountain peak. The surrounding ground suddenly shook, and billowing smoke and dust rose into the air. Then, half of the mountain peak immediately collapsed.Near the mountain peak, cries of alarm rang out incessantly, and hundreds of streaks of light swept up, rapidly flying in all directions.At this moment, from the chaotic blood light in the air, a small Nascent Soul that was several inches tall suddenly shot out. Its appearance was very similar to that of Elder Fu, but its expression was one of extreme terror, and it was about to flee into the distance.However, just as its body lit up with light, a fat figure silently appeared beside it. It was surprisingly Daoist He Shan!He expressionlessly slapped down with his palm, and the small Nascent Soul felt the air around it tighten. Then, it didn't even have time to let out a wail before it turned into a mass of red light and exploded with a bang.On the Serene Sacrifice Peak, the Tengui School's Sect Master was already greatly shocked when he saw that the joint attack of seven or eight Body Integration Stage elders was broken by the giant ape with a single slap. At this moment, when he saw the sudden appearance of Daoist He Shan, his expression immediately became extremely unsightly.He forced himself to calm down and raised his voice, asking, \"Senior He Shan, what are you doing?\"Daoist He Shan glanced at the giant golden-furred ape from afar, then turned his head and shook his head, saying, \"Sect Master Shi, to tell you the truth, your sect's two Grand Ascension Stage elders have already died at Senior Han's hands.The Tengui School is finished. \"His voice wasn't loud, but to the Tengui School's Sect Master and the surrounding Body Integration cultivators, it was like a bolt from the blue.Elder Lu and the others immediately revealed expressions of grief.Just now, they had already sensed a familiar aura from the giant ape, and now that they heard Daoist He Shan say this, they were certain that the giant golden-furred ape that was as ferocious as a primordial true spirit was Han Li, and they naturally knew that he wasn't lying.Elder Lu took a deep breath, and his lips opened and closed slightly as he transmitted his voice to Sect Master Shi.A conflicted expression appeared on Sect Master Shi's face at first, but in the end, he secretly gritted his teeth and respectfully saluted Daoist He Shan in mid-air.\"Senior He Shan, since the Tengui School is destined to be destroyed, rather than dying in vain, it is better for us to surrender now. We are willing to serve Senior Han in the future.\"Daoist He Shan revealed a strange expression and chuckled, \"Hehe, regarding the matter of serving, my realm temple is enough.As for Senior Han's anger, let your Tengui School endure it. \"A strange expression appeared on Daoist He Shan's face as he chuckled.With that said, he shook his sleeve and an ancient peach wood sword flew out. With a tremble, it soared into the air and violently expanded into a huge sword of light over 100 feet in length. Countless profound runes revolved around its surface, and its entire body erupted with a dazzling golden light.Then, the huge sword turned into a streak of golden light and slashed toward Sect Master Shi and the others.The surrounding void trembled, and an abnormally long pitch-black rift was forcibly cut open!Sect Master Shi and the others were suddenly shocked. Their figures retreated in several directions, and their bodies lit up with various colors of light. With a wave of their hands, they cast many defensive methods.While they were talking, the giant golden ape had already appeared in front of a huge mountain with a leap. With a roar, it raised both of its fists high and slammed them heavily on the mountain wall like a drum.\"Boom!\" A loud sound was heard!The mountain rock on the surface suddenly cracked inch by inch, and dense cracks spread like a spider web.Immediately afterward, the entire mountain suddenly shook, and then collapsed with a loud bang. Smoke rose from it like a yellow dragon.At this time, a tall figure suddenly flashed out of the smoke and stopped in mid-air. It was Han Li who had returned to his human form.His eyes quickly swept around and saw that there were lights everywhere. Almost all the elders and disciples of the Tengui School were fleeing in all directions.On the distant Sacrifice Peak, there were flashes of light and explosions constantly. Taoist He Shan seemed to be fighting fiercely with the Sect Master of the Tengui School and several other Body Integration cultivators, and he seemed to be at ease.Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly, and he murmured. Suddenly, he opened his mouth and spat out a silver fireball.A silver fireball immediately shot out, and with a \"poof\" sound, it transformed into a silver firebird that was about a foot long.At this time, Han Li made a gesture with his hand and pointed at the firebird.The silver firebird suddenly raised its head and let out a clear cry. Its body swelled at an incredible speed, and in the blink of an eye, it became the size of a small mountain. With a flap of its wings, it rushed to the dense buildings below.An earth-shattering loud noise!The huge firebird crashed straight into the center of the building group and burst open. It suddenly turned into a sea of fire and engulfed it.Seeing this, Han Li suddenly turned around and flew in the direction of another mountain several hundred kilometers away.He had already learned from Taoist He Shan that this mountain was called the Hidden Peak, and it was one of the most important mountains of the Tengui School. The Scripture Pavilion and Pill and Weapon Hall were located on it.\u2026 \u2026Several days later.In the courtyard of the Purple Bamboo Forest behind the Sacred Fire Peak of the Leng Yan Sect.Sima Jingming was holding a communication formation plate in his hand, and he was pacing back and forth in the room, his face full of joy.With his countless years of cultivation, he shouldn't be acting like this, but at this time, he really couldn't restrain himself.At this time, the scroll hanging on the wall in front of him suddenly lit up, and the figure of the Icy Flame Ancestor appeared.Seeing this, Sima Jingming immediately stopped and bowed to the ancestor, \"Welcome, Ancestor.\"The Icy Flame Ancestor asked indifferently, \"What's the matter? Is there a result?\"Sima Jingming's eyes were shining brightly, and he immediately said, \"Reporting to Ancestor, there is a great joyous matter.\"Hearing this, the Icy Flame Ancestor frowned slightly, but didn't say anything.Sima Jingming immediately understood that he was overjoyed and lost his composure.He hurriedly apologized, and said seriously, \"Ancestor, please forgive me. Just today, Senior Han suddenly sent a message, saying that the Tengui School has been removed from the Spirit Huan World, and he asked us to take over part of the country and sect forces that were previously controlled by the Tengui School, saying that it is to compensate for the loss of the sect's ancient books.\"Hearing this, the Icy Flame Ancestor didn't show any obvious joy on his face, and he calmly asked, \"Part \u2026 What about the Realm Temple?\"After pondering for a moment, Sima Jingming replied, \"Senior Han didn't mention this. However, according to the information we received, although the Realm Origin Temple suffered heavy losses, it didn't seem to have been exterminated like the Heavenly Ghost Sect.\"Hearing this, the Icy Flame Ancestor frowned slightly, and after thinking for a long time, he murmured,\"I originally thought that he would be able to fight to the death, and make the two sects suffer great losses, but I didn't expect that he would rely on his own strength to not only heavily damage the Realm Temple, but also flatten the Tengui School in one go. It seems that I underestimated him before.\"\"Ancestor, after this, our Leng Yan Sect will definitely be able to hold our heads high, and become the number one sect in the Spirit Huan World,\" Sima Jingming couldn't help but say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Two lines of sparkling tears silently flowed down her cheeks.\"Father, Brother, the Tengui School has already been destroyed by Han \u2026 Big Brother Han. Toyokuni has also returned to the Leng Yan Sect's control. Our Yu Family has already been completely avenged. Our clansmen will soon migrate back to their homeland. Your souls in heaven can rest in peace.\" The girl wiped away the tears on her cheeks and said in a low voice.This girl was naturally Yu Menghan. At this moment, she was crying tears of joy because she had gotten her revenge. However, she could not help but think of the tall figure of the Youth. Her heart was filled with mixed feelings.\"Big Brother Han \u2026\" She could not help but murmur.\u2026Half a month later, on the Nine Palace Peak of the Jing Yuan Temple.Han Li, dressed in green, was bending over to insert the last piece of Star Stone into the ground.Following a light \"ka\" sound, the entire Star Condensation Stage suddenly lit up.The entire Star Condensation Stage suddenly lit up. A hazy silver light descended from the sky, like a mist, enveloping the entire stage.At this moment, all of the Star Condensation Stage were lit up.Han Li raised his head to look at the starry night sky. With a calm expression, he lifted his feet and slowly walked up the stairs towards the Star Condensation Stage.\u2026Immortal World.At the edge of an unknown and boundless sea, there was a huge cliff over a thousand feet high, protruding out of the sea like the sharp beak of an eagle.At the top of the cliff, there was a majestic city that occupied an extremely large area.The outer walls of the city were more than a hundred feet high. They were made of hard rock and were completely black, blending in with the entire cliff.On the side of the wall that was close to the sea, there were many mottled traces of erosion. These were traces left behind by the thousands of feet high waves that would hit the wall every time a storm descended.Within the city, other than the four straight roads, there were also many narrow paths that crisscrossed each other. Numerous shops of various sizes were located within the city.There were quite a number of residents in the city. The main roads were filled with carriages and the small streets were also bustling with activity.In the southwest of the city, there was a narrow bluestone street. There were all sorts of restaurants, shops, and houses. Both sides of the street were filled with all kinds of banners and banners. There was an endless stream of people coming and going, making it somewhat noisy.At the end of the street, next to a poplar tree, there was an unremarkable three-story building. It had green brick walls, red wood pillars, and octagonal eaves. The roof was covered with green tiles. It faced the street and hung a green banner. The word \"Medicine\" was written on it. It looked very ordinary.In the main hall of the building, a few shop assistants in plain clothes were busy attending to the customers who came to buy elixirs. A few customers were led by the shopkeeper to the second floor along the stairs.At the top of the stairs that led to the second floor, there was a green wooden door that separated the three floors of the small building.Hua. There was. On the third of on, there. On. of Mu Hua and, there, a. and. was. on... and the stairs.. and. and Mu of the stairs..Two figures sat on either side of the table. They were holding tea in their hands.One of them looked like a Youth. He was dressed in black and had a handsome face. It was Fang Pan.The other person was about forty or fifty years old. He was slightly plump and wore gold embroidered silk. His hands were tucked into his sleeves and he had a warm smile on his face. He looked like an ordinary wealthy merchant.Fang Pan looked around the room and saw that there was a layer of faint golden light enveloping the room. He opened his mouth and said, \"Don't worry.He said, \"As the saying goes, a great hermit hides in the city. It is interesting that your Ten Direction Tower is located in the middle of the city.\"\"Haha \u2026 the Ten Direction Tower can't be compared to the big sects. What we do is whisper to each other. Naturally, we can't set it up in a secluded place.\" The middle-aged man said with a smile.\"Earlier, you sent a message saying that you have news of that person. Is this true?\" Fang Pan asked.\"Of course. We asked you to come here to complete this transaction.\" The middle-aged man said with a smile.Hearing this, Fang Pan flicked his wrist and took out a bulging green storage bag, placing it on the table.The middle-aged man picked up the storage bag and scanned it with his divine sense. The smile on his face deepened. He nodded and said, \"The person you are looking for is in the Spirit Circle.\"With that, he waved his hand. A purple gold bowl filled with clear water appeared on the table.The middle-aged man lifted a finger and knocked on the edge of the bowl.\"Dong \u2026\"The clear water in the bowl rippled. After a flash of green light, an intense battle between the giant ape and the yellow scarf giant appeared.Fang Pan saw the golden ape that was as large as a mountain. His eyes narrowed, and a piercingly cold killing intent appeared in his eyes.The middle-aged man who looked like a rich merchant did not show any change in his expression. He still had a warm smile on his face.After a while, he wiped the purple gold bowl with his palm. The light in the bowl dimmed and the scene disappeared.\"This person is still in a sect called the Realm Temple in the Spirit Circle. He should not leave for a while.\" The middle-aged man said slowly.\"Thank you for your trouble.\"Fang Pan thanked him. In his mind, he was already thinking about how to go to the Spirit Circle.\"No need. I took your money and made things convenient for you.If you need anything in the future, don't forget to come back. \"The middle-aged man's smile widened as he cupped his hands.Fang Pan was about to speak when a golden light suddenly shone from his waist. It flickered slowly and quickly.Seeing this, the middle-aged man stood up and said respectfully, \"There is no problem with the barrier here. Esteemed guest, you can rest here for a while. I will not disturb you any further.\"After saying that, he bowed slightly and left the room without looking back.After he left, Fang Pan swiped at his waist with a wave of his hand, and an extremely gorgeous golden token appeared in his palm.He looked at the golden light flashing on the token. After hesitating for a while, he closed his eyes and sent his divine sense into the token.Suddenly, his figure appeared in a magnificent hall. There were almost no furnishings in the hall, but on the four walls, there were many exquisite and magnificent patterns of flowers and birds carved in the hollow.At the front of the hall, a woman wearing a white veil over her face stood. When she saw the Youth in black, she said,\"Fang Pan, the Hidden Beast Tide that happens once in a thousand years has broken out in the Cloud Floating World. Hundreds of cities have been slaughtered and dozens of sects have been destroyed.I order you to go to the Cloud Floating World to deal with this. \"Hearing this, the Youth in black's face stiffened. After hesitating for a while, he said,\"Celestial messenger, it will take at least a few years to completely quell the Hidden Beast Tide. I still have some urgent matters that I have to deal with immediately. May I ask if someone else can take on this mission?\"\"The others under me all have their own missions. No one is free. Only you have not taken on a new mission since you completed the last mission.\" The goddess in white shook her head and said.\"Celestial messenger, can \u2026\"\"Fang Pan, don't forget your duty and the rules of the Immortal Palace.\" Fang Pan wanted to explain but was interrupted by the goddess in white.\"I don't dare. Fang Pan accepts the order.\" Although Fang Pan was unwilling, he could only reply helplessly.After he withdrew his divine sense from the token, his face darkened. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Consider yourself lucky. I'll let you live a few more years.\"\u2026 \u2026Three years later, in the Realm Temple.At night, the Nine Palace Mountain shone with silver light as if it was daytime.The entire Star Condensation Arena was enveloped by seven incomparably thick pillars of silvery white light. A huge tornado formed from the convergence of the power of the stars surrounded the pillars of light, looking like a huge wall that could not be crossed.At this moment, on the high platform, Han Li was sitting cross-legged in the center. His body seemed to be filled with starlight. His entire body shone brightly and was almost transparent.On his chest and abdomen, six blue dots of light were distributed like spoons, shining brightly. At the end of the spoon, the seventh blue dot of light was still a bit hazy, but it was already on the verge of appearing.At this moment, Han Li's eyelashes trembled a few times and his eyes suddenly opened. He stopped his hand seals and the seven pillars of light that enveloped the Star Condensation Stage immediately dispersed and gradually disappeared.In the air, the seven black lights flew over and turned into seven Star Moon Treasured Mirrors that fell into Han Li's hands. He casually put them away.Back in the Realm Origin Temple, in order to break free from the Secret Realm, he had detonated the original mirror. Later, he obtained a large number of Yin Chen Stones from the Heavenly Ghost Sect, so he refined the seven mirrors again.A smile appeared on his face as he muttered to himself, \"Finally, the seventh mysterious aperture is about to be condensed.\"Originally, he didn't have much of an intuitive understanding of Xuan Immortals. But ever since the battle with the Yellow Turban Giant three years ago, coupled with his comprehension of the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique, he had a more precise understanding of this level.He believed that when he achieved the True Extreme Body, if he encountered an opponent like the Yellow Turban Giant again, he might not need to use the Provenance True Devil Art anymore. His physical strength alone would be enough to suppress the opponent.Thinking of this, he suddenly remembered something. With a flick of his wrist, a walnut-sized yellow bean appeared in the palm of his hand.It was the one that he had taken from the Yellow Turban Giant's chest.Ever since he learned that there was a secret organization in the Immortal World that had placed a bounty on his head, Han Li had been busy cultivating and improving his strength. Today was the first time he had carefully examined the bean.He held it in his hand and observed it for a moment. He found that apart from its size being several times larger than ordinary soybeans, there was nothing special about it.However, when he probed the soybean with his divine sense, he was suddenly surprised.He saw that the inside of the bean was filled with a strong green light. If he had not seen it with his own eyes and instead closed his eyes to feel it, Han Li would have thought that there was a vast forest in front of him, filled with an astonishing vitality.\"This thing has such a rich vitality, it is really extraordinary.\" After Han Li opened his eyes, he could not help but exclaim.This yellow bean was only used to condense the Yellow Turban Giant, but he did not know how to use it. But judging from the vitality contained in this thing, it might be of great use in the future.After a moment of pondering, he waved his wrist and put away the female bean. He then stood up and walked down the stone steps of the Star Gathering Platform.At this time, a thick beam of light suddenly flew over from the night sky and landed in front of him.He saw Taoist He Shan, with an anxious look on his face, appear from the light. He quickly bowed to Han Li and said:Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"What's the matter?\" Han Li asked with a frown.\"Just now, Fellow Sima sent a message from the Leng Yan Sect, saying \u2026 saying that Miss Liu was \u2026 taken away \u2026\" Daoist He Shan said with some hesitation.\"Make it clear, what's going on?\" Han Li's face darkened slightly.As soon as Daoist He Shan saw Han Li's unfriendly expression, he hurriedly opened his mouth to explain:\"In the evening, a woman in white suddenly broke through the restriction of the Spirit Flame Mountain Range, and went straight to Chuyun Peak to take away Miss Liu.\"\"That person just took away Le 'er so openly, did no one from the Leng Yan Sect stop it?\" Han Li pondered for a moment, then continued to ask.\"Fellow Sima said that he tried to stop it, but as soon as he made a move, it was easily resolved by the woman, and the other party just casually waved her sleeve to send him flying, there was no way to stop it.However, the woman didn't seem to have any intention of harming people, only saying that she was from the same clan as Miss Liu, and then left with Miss Liu. \"Daoist He Shan bowed and answered.\"With a wave of her sleeve, she repelled Sima Jingming \u2026\" Han Li was startled, and fell silent.\"That's what Fellow Sima said.Senior Han, do you need me to send a disciple to investigate the whereabouts of Miss Liu Le 'er, my temple is still very \u2026 \"Daoist He Shan carefully proposed.\"As far as you know, in this world, is there anyone who can repel a Great Ascension stage cultivator with a wave of his hand?\" Han Li glanced at the other party, interrupting what he wanted to say next.\"This \u2026 there shouldn't be.\" Daoist He Shan was slightly startled.\"Well, I know this matter, you can leave.\" Han Li heard this, and so said.Daoist He Shan respectfully agreed, and flew away from the Condensing Star Platform.Han Li watched Daoist He Shan leave, and was silent for a moment, then suddenly waved his hand, a layer of silver light appeared, covering the entire Condensing Star Platform.\u2026 \u2026Early in the morning the next day.Taoist He Shan's plump figure once again appeared in front of Nine Palace Peak. He bowed deeply in the direction of the Star Condensation Platform and said loudly,\"Junior He Shan greets Senior Han.\"Actually, for the past three years, he would report here every day and report to Han Li about the various movements in the Spirit Huan World. Moreover, he would occasionally act as the Leng Yan Sect's mouthpiece, rain or shine, and never stopped.In fact, most of the time, Han Li was cultivating in seclusion. He would respectfully report to Han Li and wait patiently at the side for about an hour. Then, he would respectfully bid farewell and leave. The whole process was respectful, without the slightest bit of impatience.As a result, in the past thousand days, the disciples of the entire temple gradually discovered that this reclusive dacheng stage grand elder, who was rarely seen in a hundred years, could be seen from time to time. Although they could still only see him from a distance, it really made many low-ranking disciples excited.Of course, almost all the Unity stage and some Void Training stage elders in the temple naturally more or less knew some inside information, but they very tacitly chose to keep their mouths shut, as if they didn't know about it.Daoist He Shan's expression was respectful as he stood in the void three hundred feet away from Nine Palace Peak with his hands by his side. Looking at the Condensing Star Platform that was enveloped by the silver light screen, he was slightly puzzled.In the past, when Han Li cultivated in seclusion, the surroundings would be filled with surging star power, and there would be some movement. Why was it so quiet today?Although he was slightly puzzled, he didn't dare to rashly disturb Han Li. Perhaps Han Li was cultivating in another place. He obediently waited at the side, and after two hours, he once again left.In the end, as time passed, he still came here every day, but found that there was not the slightest movement in the Condensing Star Platform.In the blink of an eye, more than two months passed, and Daoist He Shan gradually became somewhat impatient.On this day, he waited for a full half a day, and found that there was still not the slightest change in the Condensing Star Platform. The silver light screen around him flickered slightly.Daoist He Shan took a deep breath and raised his voice, \"Senior Han, I've found some more clues regarding the matter of Liu Le 'er. I wonder if you have the time now?\"There was not the slightest response from the light screen.\"Senior Han!\" Daoist He Shan shouted again, but there was still no response from the light screen.\"Could it be \u2026\" His expression changed as he thought of something. With a wave of his hand, a ray of golden light struck the silver light screen.Crack!The silver light screen shattered, and the Condensing Star Platform inside was empty. There was no sign of Han Li.However, there was a white jade slip at the center of the platform.Daoist He Shan picked it up and probed it with his spiritual sense. The fat all over his body trembled incessantly, and his face revealed an excited expression.The jade slip recorded the method to remove the restriction in his body.\"Many thanks, Senior Han!\"He withdrew his spiritual sense and looked towards the distant horizon. He didn't care if the other party could hear him or not, and bowed from afar.\u2026 \u2026Spirit Flame Mountain Range.In a large hall, Sima Jingming discussed with the Sect Master and a few Integration Stage Elders for a while before they left. Only Sima Jingming was left in the hall.He let out a light breath, and his face looked slightly tired.Ever since the Tengui School, the once number one sect in the Spirit Huan Domain, was burned to ashes overnight, the various forces had been fighting for the territory of the Tengui School for the past few years. As the only sect among the original three sects that had not suffered any damage, the Leng Yan Sect was especially busy.He, a Mahayana Stage existence, did not have the time to cultivate in peace, and had to deal with various affairs all day long.For a long period of time in the past, he basically only cared about cultivating in seclusion and rarely paid attention to the affairs of the sect. Now that he suddenly had to deal with the affairs of the sect, he was really not used to it.Of course, part of the reason why he was like this was because the Realm Origin Temple, which he thought had suffered a great loss, not only did it not suffer any loss, it even gained many benefits from the incident at the Tengui School.He naturally knew why it was like this, but he could not say it clearly.However, the expansion of the power of the Leng Yan Sect, the Cold Flame Ancestor in the Celestial Realm was extremely happy, and had already given several rewards.With these rewards, if he went into seclusion, his strength would be able to improve further.If this continued, it would not be impossible for him to ascend to the Celestial Realm in the future.Sima Jingming was secretly happy. He stood up and was about to walk towards the back of the hall.\"Fellow Sima.\" A familiar voice suddenly sounded.Sima Jingming's expression suddenly changed.A green light flashed, and a green-robed man appeared out of thin air in the hall. It was Han Li.In his hand that was hidden in his sleeve, a flickering purple talisman shadow flashed.Sima Jingming's pupils shrank when he saw who it was. Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, and a bright smile appeared on his face. He cupped his hands and said, \"So it's Senior Han. I haven't seen you for a few years, and you're even more powerful than before. Congratulations.\"\"Fellow Sima is too polite.\" Han Li's tone was quite cold.\"Senior Han, please take a seat.\"Sima Jingming's heart skipped a beat. He quickly invited Han Li to sit in the main seat, and he sat next to him.\"Han didn't come today for anything. I just heard that my sister Liu was taken away from the Leng Yan Sect. Is it true?\" Han Li sat down and immediately said.\"It's \u2026 it's my fault. I let someone take Miss Liu away, but there's something else \u2026\" Sima Jingming said anxiously.\"About the person who took away Le 'er, do you have any clues? What did she say that day?\" Han Li expressionlessly interrupted him.\"Senior, that person was a young and beautiful woman in white. She claimed to be from the same clan as Liu Le 'er. She asked me to tell Friend Han, thank you for taking care of Le' er.As for this woman, I've definitely never seen her before. After that, I also sent out many disciples to investigate, but to no avail.So, I have a private guess \u2026 \"Sima Jingming hesitated towards the end.\"Tell me about it.\" Han Li raised his eyebrows slightly.\"I'm guessing that this woman is not from the Spirit Huan Domain. After all, she's extremely powerful. I couldn't even take one blow from her.Moreover, this woman is a Perfected Immortal from the Upper Realm. \"\"Perfected Immortal!\"Han Li already had some guesses in his heart. When he heard Sima Jingming say so, he was not surprised. He just frowned and pondered.According to what he knew, the Cloud Fox Clan that Liu Le 'er belonged to was only a declining branch of the Demon Fox Clan. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been exterminated by the Blood Saber Clan. Why would a Perfected Immortal suddenly appear?Could it be that one of her ancestors ascended to the Celestial Realm and coincidentally returned to the Spirit Huan Domain? Or perhaps, Liu Le 'er was hiding something from him \u2026\"Since Fellow Sima has tried your best, Han naturally can't blame you.Fortunately, that person is from the same clan as Le 'er. He shouldn't harm her. \"Han Li thought and sighed.Sima Jingming secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Han Li didn't get angry. Only then did he realize that his back was covered in cold sweat.\"Oh right, Han came here because I have something to ask Fellow Sima.\" Han Li was silent for a moment, then suddenly spoke.\"I don't dare, I don't dare!Senior Han, please speak. I will definitely tell you everything I know. \"Sima Jingming hurriedly said.\"I wonder if your sect's Fellow Leng Yan told you about ascending to the Celestial Realm?Is there any taboo in ascending to the Celestial Realm from the Spirit Huan Domain? \"Han Li didn't stand on ceremony and asked directly.Sima Jingming was shocked. After taking a deep breath, he answered respectfully, \"Senior Han is a Strength Cultivator.Once you cultivate the True Extreme Body, your physical body will be rejected by the power of this world. If you want to ascend, you must break through the void. \"\"I see.\"Han Li nodded in realization. No wonder the closer he got to completion of the Little Big Dipper Origin Skill, the more he felt an indescribable invisible force suppressing him. It even affected his ability to cast spells and fly.\"The Spirit Huan Domain is close to the Northern Frost Celestial Realm. So if you ascend to the Celestial Realm from here, you will be randomly picked up by an Immortal Platform in the Northern Frost Celestial Realm.On the contrary, because the spiritual energy in the Lower Realm is thin, those who are able to ascend successfully all possess extremely high natural talent and a firm disposition. Thus, they are generally valued in the Immortal Dimension. \"Sima Jingming didn't conceal anything and spoke of everything he knew.Hearing this, Han Li's expression didn't change at all, but his mind was filled with thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"That's right, other than the Immortal Platform's guidance, there's actually another method in the Spirit Huan Realm that's similar to smuggling. One can secretly ascend to the Immortal Realm without being guided by the Immortal Platform.\" Sima Jingming suddenly thought of something when he saw that Han Li was silent and added.\"Oh, tell me about it.\" Han Li's heart skipped a beat and he asked casually.\"This method is simple. It's to find some weak space nodes between the Spirit Huan Realm and the Immortal Realm. Through the power of a spatial array or other methods, one can forcefully break it open to enter the gap between the realms and finally arrive at the Immortal Realm.\" Sima Jingming said after some thought.\"This method is not the right way. It's probably very difficult.\" Han Li said thoughtfully but he laughed bitterly in his heart.Wasn't this the method he used when he ascended from the Human Realm to the Spirit Realm?But thinking about it, only a realm that was close to the Immortal Realm like the Spirit Huan Realm could use this method.\"Senior is wise.This method is extremely risky. The gap between the realms is extremely dangerous. Even if one is lucky enough to pass through, there's a high chance that one will be teleported to some dangerous place in the Immortal Realm. After all, the space in the Immortal Realm is weak and usually not a good place.Also, using this method to ascend, one won't be able to enjoy the benefits of tempering one's body in the celestial pool or obtaining a celestial identity token. One will also encounter many difficulties in the Immortal Realm. \"Sima Jingming replied honestly.Han Li nodded slowly. His expression was normal but he was quite excited in his heart.The matter of ascending to the Immortal Realm had always been on his mind. Now, he finally found a solution.As for the danger that Sima Jingming mentioned, with his current strength, he should be fine as long as he was well prepared. Therefore, he didn't take it to heart.\"Thank you, Fellow Sima.\" He nodded in thanks.\"Senior Han, please don't be so courteous with me.Senior has given my sect such great benefits this time. The Elder Ancestor has specially instructed me to thank Senior Han properly. \"Sima Jingming said sincerely.\"Is that so? I didn't think that Fellow Leng Yan still remembers Han.\" Han Li smiled faintly and said meaningfully.Sima Jingming's heart thumped, and he hurriedly said, \"You jest, Senior Han. Patriarch...\"\"Alright, Fellow Daoist Sima, please wait a moment,\" said Han Li before he suddenly turned around, and his figure transformed into an azure ray of light that shot towards the distance.Sima Jingming couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief as he watched the azure ray of light vanish into the horizon.\u2026After Han Li left the Leng Yan Sect, it was as if he had vanished from the face of the earth, and he never appeared in the Spirit Huan World again.However, for some unknown reason, some of his deeds were embellished and turned into several versions. Gradually, they spread and he became a legendary figure.Because of his appearance, in a short few years, a reign of terror had arisen in the cultivation world of the Spirit World that had originally achieved some sort of balance.Some said that he was an expert who was in closed-door cultivation all year round, some said that he was actually an immortal, and some even said that he was actually an old demon who had lived for god knows how many tens of thousands of years and had a true spirit descendant.The entire cultivation world of the Spirit World had mixed opinions about him. Some thought that he was a great devil who killed without batting an eyelid, while others thought that he had eradicated the Tengui School, a force that had always been overbearing and unreasonable, and had returned peace to the Spirit Huan World.In short, there were many different opinions.However, the chaos after the destruction of such a colossus like the Tengui School still lasted for a few hundred years. After the various sects and forces went through countless rounds of small and large conflicts, and after countless cultivators of all sizes died, a new situation gradually formed and slowly stabilized.Of course, these were all for later.A few months after Liu Le 'er's disappearance, on a day where the sun was blazing high up in the sky.A certain ocean in the north of the Spirit Huan World was boundless, and because of the dense black fog that would often rise up from the ocean, it was called the Black Fog Ocean.The spiritual energy in this area of the ocean was very dense, and there were many sea beasts living there. There were also several special spiritual materials that could not be found outside, so there was an endless stream of cultivators who came here to explore and hunt sea beasts.Near a deserted island in the depths of the Black Fog, a rumbling sound spread far and wide. The ocean surface within a radius of several tens of miles tumbled, and huge waves that were over a hundred feet tall rose up and surged in all directions. Even the dense black fog above the ocean surface started to swirl under the effect of an invisible force, forming an incomparably huge whirlpool.In the center of the whirlpool was a green-robed young woman, a black-robed old man, and a middle-aged Daoist priest. They were fighting fiercely with a sea beast that looked like a manatee.These three people all had early stage Soul Formation cultivations. Although the cultivation techniques they cultivated were different, they were very skilled in their coordination. It was obvious that this was not the first time they had joined forces.The light from their magic treasures connected with each other to form a large circle, surrounding the bull-like sea beast in the center, and they launched wave after wave of ferocious attacks.The sea beast was completely blue in color, and there were two black stripes on its back, extending from its forehead all the way to its tail, giving it a very strange appearance.From time to time, it would let out a strange cry that sounded like a cow's roar, and blue light flashed from its body as countless blue balls of lightning appeared to defend against the oncoming attacks. At the same time, it was constantly blasting thick bolts of blue light toward the three people above it.Although its cultivation was slightly higher than the three of them at the intermediate stage of the Soul Formation Stage, its attacks were still limited, and it was gradually being suppressed by the light from the magic treasures of the three cultivators.The fierce battle continued for another hour before the blue sea beast's protective light was finally broken, and its head was pierced through by a rapidly rotating black sword projection from the black-robed old man, leaving a large bloody hole in its head.The sea beast howled in anguish and struggled a few times before it soon stopped moving.\"Haha, Fellow Daoist Qin's Soul Devouring Heart Piercing Sword is indeed powerful; even this mature Black Spotted Sea Cow, which is renowned for its defense, can't withstand it,\" the middle-aged Daoist priest praised with a hearty laugh.\"You're far too kind, Fellow Daoist Ku Mu.\"A hint of smugness flashed through the black-robed old man's eyes, and he waved a hand to withdraw the black sword projection. This was a strange-looking longsword that resembled two intertwined venomous snakes, and it was exuding a cold black light.The old man waved a hand to stow the sword away with a treasured expression.This treasure was something that he had saved up for most of his life, and its power was comparable to that of a normal spirit treasure. It also possessed some armor-piercing abilities, and it was something that he had specially refined in order to deal with sea beasts with thick skin and thick flesh.The three of them quickly finished dissecting the sea cow's carcass, and each of them reaped a significant harvest.The green-robed young woman cast her gaze toward the ocean up ahead, and she suggested, \"In my opinion, even if we can't defeat a Soul Formation Final Stage sea beast, we should be able to escape unscathed. Why don't we go deeper?\"The middle-aged daoist priest's eyes flashed, and he seemed to be rather tempted by this suggestion.\"Absolutely not. The two of you haven't been to the Black Sea for long, so you might not know this, but if we go any further, we'll reach the renowned Star Eye region of the Black Sea. There are countless incomparably deep sea eyes there, and there are many extremely powerful sea beasts living there. There are even Spatial Tempering Stage and even Body Integration Stage sea beasts there. It's even rumored that there's a five-clawed black dragon that's comparable to a Grand Ascension Stage sea beast at the deepest part of the sea eyes.Most of those sea beasts stay in the sea eyes and very rarely come to the surface of the ocean, but aside from some Body Integration Stage mighty figures, no one dares to approach that place.In all honesty, it's already very dangerous for us to pursue this Blackspot Sea Cow to this point. We can't continue onward; it's best that we retreat immediately, \"the black-robed old man hurriedly said with a grave expression.\"A Grand Ascension Stage sea beast?How is that possible? \"The daoist priest drew a sharp breath.The green-robed young woman also wore an incredulous expression.\"That's only a legend. It's said that the five-clawed black dragon has been here for over 100,000 years, and the last time it appeared was several thousand years ago. At that time, it was already at the pinnacle of the Body Integration Stage. It hasn't appeared for so many years, so perhaps its lifespan has already run out.In any case, this place is already fraught with peril, so our top priority is to get out of here as soon as possible, \"the black-robed old man said with an urgent shake of his head.The daoist priest and the green-robed young woman hurriedly nodded in response. Just as the three of them were about to fly back, an earth-shattering boom erupted from the ocean up ahead.The sound had come from an extremely far away place, but it was still clearly transmitted to the three of them. Furthermore, the nearby ocean tremored violently.Their expressions changed drastically upon seeing this.Before the three of them had a chance to react, another rumbling boom erupted from up ahead. At the same time, a burst of enormous and chaotic spiritual pressure swept toward them, sweeping up torrential gale-force winds.The three of them were horrified and tried to flee, but it was already too late. They hadn't even flown far before they were swept away by the gale-force winds, and they were like three fallen leaves in a fierce gale.Fortunately, the gale-force winds had only traveled a short distance before they began to weaken. The three of them hurriedly circulated their cultivation arts and quickly stabilized themselves, but their faces had already turned deathly pale with fright.Right at this moment, another earth-shattering boom resounded!The surface of the sea a hundred kilometers in front of them suddenly exploded, and an enormous black shadow flew out from within. It flew a great distance in the air, and then with a bang, it smashed heavily onto the deserted island not far away from the black-robed old man's group of three, causing the entire deserted island to shake violently. Waves of air even caused the surrounding waves to surge endlessly.The black shadow was an incomparably huge ink-black flood dragon. Its body was two to three hundred meters long, and its entire body was covered in pitch-black scales. There were two long crystalline horns on its head that looked like coral.There were four massive dragon claws on the giant wyrm's abdomen, and each claw had five toes that resembled giant black swords. They shone with a chilling light that made one shudder.An indescribably enormous aura emanated from the five-clawed black wyrm's body.This scene caused the three of them to turn deathly pale, especially the black-robed old man. He wasn't a rogue cultivator, but an inner disciple of a sizable sect that had a Form Synthesis Stage ancestor overseeing it.However, the aura emitted by the five-clawed black wyrm was far above that of the mighty Form Synthesis Stage ancestor in his sect.\"Could it be that the rumor is actually true?\" The old man was greatly shocked, and he couldn't help but make a bold guess in his heart.The five-clawed wyrm struggled to turn over its body, causing the ground to tremble once more.The black-robed old man and the others were startled, and they hurriedly retreated more than a hundred feet away. When they looked again, they saw that there was a large hole in the wyrm's chest, and a large amount of blood was gushing out, dyeing a large area of the barren island red.\"Whoosh!\"A green figure shot out from the sea, and its speed was so fast that only a shadow could be seen. It flashed past the five-clawed wyrm.A cold glint flashed past!The wyrm's body paused, and then its huge head soared into the sky. An incomparably thick pillar of blood shot into the sky, and the entire barren island seemed to have fallen into a rain of blood. A nauseating stench pervaded the air.\"Boom!\"The wyrm's huge body crashed to the ground, and it trembled a few times. Finally, it stopped moving.At this moment, a black light flashed out of the giant wyrm's head, and a mini black wyrm that was a few inches in size was wrapped in it. It was about to flee into the distance in a panic.However, the azure humanoid figure seemed to have anticipated this, and his body swayed as he positioned himself in front of the wyrm. He opened his mouth to expel a burst of azure light that enveloped the wyrm, then dragged it back into a jade vial.The black-robed old man and the others were dumbfounded, and they stood stiffly in the air not far away. The green-robed young woman even subconsciously swallowed her saliva.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe green-robed man ignored the old man in black robe and calmly walked to the side of the huge head of the five-clawed dragon. He raised one hand and grasped the void with his five fingers.\"Puff!\"A part of the head exploded and a fist-sized black crystal core flew out from it. There were mysterious black patterns on the surface. It was the monster core of the five-clawed black dragon.The Youth looked at it with a blank expression and put it away. Then he put his five fingers together and turned them into a knife, slightly blurring.\"Ka ka\" several crisp sounds, the four giant claws of the dragon were cut off.After the Youth put away the giant claws, he turned his eyes to the neck of the giant dragon.There was a pale silver scale that was nearly ten feet long. It was completely different from the surrounding black scales. There were also a few pale silver bone spurs around it, exuding amazing spiritual power fluctuations.On the scales and bone spurs, there were also some faint patterns similar to those on the monster core.The Youth carefully removed the silver scale and bone spurs. He also took a few monster materials from the dragon's body. Then he stood up and turned his head to look at the old man in black robe and the other two.Although there was no malice in the man's eyes, the old man and the other two were still shocked, cold sweat like rain, and they were at a loss of what to do.The green-robed man ignored the three of them and quickly withdrew his gaze. His figure turned into a green rainbow and flew away.When the man completely disappeared in the distance, the three of them breathed a sigh of relief.\"This \u2026 could this dragon be the five-clawed black dragon we were just talking about?\" The middle-aged Taoist looked at the black dragon's broken body and said.\"It should be, and looking at the situation, it is very likely that this dragon has advanced to the Mahayana Stage!\" The old man in black robe had just calmed down at the moment and nodded.The young woman in green robe and the middle-aged Taoist heard this and took a deep breath.\"That senior could actually kill this dragon with his bare hands, and it seems that he did not use much strength. Could it be that he is also a great cultivator of the Mahayana Stage?I have seen the image of Senior Sima of the Leng Yan Sect and Senior He Shan of the Jing Yuan Temple. It seems that he is not one of them. \"The young woman in green robe still had some lingering fear and said with a puzzled face.\"Could it be that he changed his appearance?\" The middle-aged Taoist priest thought of a possibility.\"I don't think so. Judging from the black dragon's wound, that senior should be a pure Strength Cultivator. There's an 80% chance that it's not those two seniors.\" The black-robed elder shook his head.\"If it's not the two of them, then there are other Great Ascension Stage beings in this Spirit Huan Domain?\" The young woman in green was slightly surprised.\"There's one more... Could it be that you've forgotten about Senior Han Li, who destroyed the Heavenly Ghost Sect in a single night several years ago? He was a strength cultivator!\" At this point, the black-robed old man unconsciously lowered his voice.\"That legendary Senior Han \u2026 That's right, according to the rumors, he looks extremely young. Could it really be him?\" The green-robed woman's eyes lit up slightly.\"Legend has it that Senior Han is a banished immortal from the Immortal Realm. He's a true immortal!\" the middle-aged Daoist priest said with excitement.As the three of them spoke, their gazes quickly fell on the Five Clawed Black Dragon's corpse. Their eyes shone with a fiery light.Although Han Li didn't care for the dragon's corpse and didn't want it, to these three Soul Formation Stage cultivators, even a small piece of dragon's flesh would be enough to cause quite a commotion when they brought it back.After all, this was the flesh of a Great Ascension Stage demonic beast!\u2026 \u2026The Heavenly Crystal Sect had a history of two to three hundred thousand years. Although it couldn't compare to super sects like the Leng Yan Sect or the Realm Origin Temple, there were still several Body Integration Stage cultivators in the sect. Their strength was not to be underestimated.However, this sect had always been low-key, so it wasn't very famous in the Spirit Huan Domain.At this moment, inside the Heavenly Crystal Sect, in a huge martial arts arena.A dazzling golden light flashed, and a thunderous sound rang out!A silver-robed elder flew out like a kite with a broken string. He crashed into the martial arts arena's barrier and spat out a mouthful of blood, dyeing the front of his robes red.A pale gold alms bowl spun as it flew back. The spiritual light on its surface was dim, as if it was heavily injured.In front of the elder, a green-robed cultivator stood in the air. His face was shrouded in a layer of green light, so his appearance couldn't be seen clearly. He slowly retracted his right hand.Outside the martial arts arena, there were three other Body Integration Stage cultivators. When they saw this scene, they were all shocked. They hurriedly removed the barrier around the martial arts arena and flew in front of the silver-robed elder. They stared at the green-robed cultivator in the distance with vigilance.\"Great Elder, are you alright?\"\"I'm fine. This fellow cultivator has already shown mercy.\" The silver-robed elder took out a glistening yellow pill and swallowed it. His complexion slowly improved.When he said this, the three people around him were stunned.\"Fellow cultivator's strength is extraordinary. I couldn't even take one blow from you. I'm ashamed.\" The silver-robed elder cupped his hands towards the green-robed cultivator in the air and smiled bitterly.\"Since you've admitted defeat, then according to our agreement, you should hand over the Eight Treasure Exquisite Jade.\" The green-robed cultivator said calmly. It sounded like he wasn't very old.The silver-robed elder helplessly said to a large Body Integration Stage cultivator beside him.Although the burly man's face was filled with reluctance, he still stomped his foot and shot forward.A short moment later, he flew back with a white jade box that was several feet long and half a foot wide. He handed it over to the silver-robed elder.The old man gently stroked the jade box and a trace of reluctance flashed through his eyes. He waved his hand and a golden light wrapped around the jade box before handing it over to the green-robed cultivator.The green-robed cultivator reached out to receive the jade box. Azure light flashed from his finger and he pointed at the jade box.With a crackling sound, the white jade box slowly opened on its own to reveal several white jade stones of different sizes. Although they looked ordinary, there was a faint eight-colored light flowing on their surfaces. It was quite peculiar.The green-robed cultivator nodded and closed the lid of the box before putting it away.The silver-robed elder sighed and said, \"Our sect has several Exquisite Jade Essence mines. It took tens of thousands of years to accumulate these top-grade Eight Treasure Exquisite Jade. I hope you can make good use of them.\"\"Don't worry, I naturally won't let these Exquisite Jade go to waste.\" The green-robed cultivator chuckled and flicked his finger.A ray of white light shot out and landed in front of the silver-robed elder. It was a storage bracelet.\"I won't take your sect's items for nothing. The things inside should be enough to compensate for these Eight Treasure Exquisite Jade.\"The green-robed cultivator said indifferently. Then, his figure flashed and turned into a ray of azure light, disappearing into the sky in a flash.The silver-robed elder's Divine Sense entered the storage bracelet and he was shocked.There was a huge amount of spirit stones inside, as well as a batch of ten-thousand-year-old spirit herbs and some extremely precious demon beast materials.In terms of value, it was indeed not less than the Eight Treasure Exquisite Jade. In fact, it was slightly more valuable.\u2026 \u2026In just a few short months, many strange things happened in various places in the Spirit Huan Domain.A few sects' precious materials, secret skills, cultivation methods, and ancient books were taken away by a mysterious person one after another.This person came from nowhere and his cultivation was extremely high. However, his actions were considered appropriate. The sects whose treasures were taken away received considerable compensation. Hence, it did not arouse the public anger of the various sects in the Spirit Huan Domain. Instead, many itinerant cultivators and sect disciples who had nothing to do with it discussed it enthusiastically.This person's appearance was very sudden. After being active for a few months, he suddenly disappeared without a trace and never appeared again.In the blink of an eye, another half a year had passed.In the southeastern region of the Spirit Huan Domain, there was an extremely huge crimson mountain range. It was called the Fire Cloud Mountain Range and it stretched for hundreds of thousands of miles.In the mountain range, there were many connected giant volcanoes that spewed extremely hot magma all year round. The air was filled with the pungent smell of sulfur and it was extremely hot.Almost all the mountains were black and red in color, as if they were burning red Stone. Even the clouds in the sky were crimson red all year round, hence the name Fire Cloud Mountain Range.This was the largest land of Fire Spirit in the Spirit Huan Domain, and it was also one of the famous dangerous places in this domain. Even cultivators with high cultivation dared not to venture deep into it.In the depths of the Fire Cloud Mountain Range was an incomparably huge abyss. In the deepest part of it, there was a river of magma that surged and rumbled loudly.The surface of the magma flickered with red light as if there were countless burning flames.The temperature here was so high that the surrounding air became blurry and distorted with faint ripples.On a cliff less than three hundred meters away from the river of magma, a giant cave was dug out by someone. There were all kinds of lights flashing inside, and various sharp whistling sounds could be heard from time to time.On this day, a long howl that sounded like a dragon's roar came from the cave. Then, an extremely thick white pillar of light rose from the cave and shot straight into the sky.Within the pillar of light, one could vaguely see two flood dragons and a giant shadow of bone armor. After a long time, it slowly dissipated.In the cave, a green-robed man sat cross-legged there.It was Han Li. At this moment, his face was filled with joy.Two treasures that were flickering with spiritual light were floating in front of him. One was a white bone armor that had an ancient design. There were eight pictures carved on it, and they seemed to be some kind of shield, treasure umbrella, or something like that.There was also a pair of ferocious-looking silver boxing gloves. There were silver-white bone spurs on the boxing gloves, and they looked like two flood dragon heads.The two treasures emitted a shocking wave of spiritual power.Han Li's gaze swept across the two treasures slowly, and a trace of satisfaction flashed across his face.This white bone armor was called the Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor, and the boxing gloves were called the Heaven Piercing Boxing Armor.He found the method to refine these two treasures from the ancient books of the Tengui School. They were not ordinary treasures. In a sense, they were treasures that were specially made for strength cultivators, and they needed extremely strong physical strength to unleash their great power.Since Sima Jingming said that it was very dangerous to use this method to secretly ascend, he spent a lot of effort to collect countless rare treasures to refine these two treasures.Han Li opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of green light. He put away the bone armor and boxing gloves, and flipped his hand to take out a green jade book. On it was a detailed map of the Spirit Huan Domain.On the jade book map, there were a few places that were specially marked.These were the locations of the weak spatial nodes that he found from the ancient books of various sects. However, he had not personally gone to verify them.Han Li pondered for a while, and his gaze landed on a marked point in the southeast region of the jade book map. His gaze flickered a few times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySpirit Huan Domain, on a huge snowy mountain that was more than thirty thousand feet tall.There was a thick layer of dark, leaden clouds in the sky, from which rumbling sounds of thunder could be heard. Bolts of dark blue lightning flickered indistinctly in the depths of the cloud layer.Below it, wild winds howled, and the white snowflakes that filled the sky swirled wildly. It was a vast expanse, and it almost covered the entire mountain peak.And in a place that was more than a hundred miles away from this mountain peak, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse. It was quiet, and it formed a very clear contrast with this place.The sharp peak at the top of the snowy mountain had been shaved off by someone with great power, and turned into a huge platform that was at least a hundred feet in circumference.On the platform, there were dozens of black stone pillars that were a hundred feet tall. They looked messy and disorderly, but in reality, there was a secret to them, and they formed a huge ring-shaped array with two circles inside and outside.On the ground in the middle of the array, there were complicated and intricate spirit inscriptions, and on the top of the surrounding stone pillars, there were pieces of extremely pure spirit stones.At this moment, there was a tall and straight figure, facing the wind and snow that filled the sky, sitting cross-legged in the center of the array.He wore a thin green robe, and his face that was not outstanding was clearly defined. His eyes that were like stars were bright and deep, and they shone with a light that could make one's heart tremble. It was Han Li.He closed his eyes lightly, and his hands quickly formed seals in front of him. He chanted some kind of obscure incantation in a low voice, and the Little Big Dipper Origin Skill in his body quickly circulated.In an instant, the mountain peak shone brightly.Countless silver-white starlight directly broke through the dark clouds, and shot down from the sky. It turned into seven incomparably thick silver-white pillars of light, and enveloped the entire mountain peak.The snowflakes that were originally flying in the wild wind, fell into the silver light, and instantly melted, turning into a cloud of water vapor, and disappeared.Han Li formed a seal with both hands above his head, and made a gesture of raising his hands to the sky. Immediately, a dark light flashed at his waist, and the seven Star Moon Treasured Mirrors flew straight out. Each flew into a pillar of light, and radiated brilliant light.At the same time, a strange vortex suddenly appeared above Han Li's head, and it attracted the seven treasured mirrors towards it.As the vortex grew larger and larger, the suction force from within also grew stronger and stronger. All seven mirrors were involuntarily drawn towards the center.As for the seven huge pillars of light, they were also pulled by this force, all of them slanting and converging towards the center.\"Boom!\" A muffled sound rang out, like a clap of thunder.The seven silver pillars of light finally converged together, fusing into a huge pillar of light that was over a thousand feet thick. It covered the entire mountain peak and connected the heavens and the earth.At this moment, the Big Dipper in the depths of the sky shone brightly, and an astonishing change began to take place.Starting from the Dubhe star, the Merak, Phecda, Megrez, and the rest of the seven stars actually lit up with a silvery-purple radiance in succession. Following that, they flickered one after the other.After a few cycles, the seven stars of the Big Dipper began to shift. First, they turned from their original dipper shape into a straight line. Then, they connected their heads to their tails and turned into a circle.Immediately after, an incomparably thick beam of silvery-purple light surged out from the ring. It seemed to have traversed millions of miles, traversed the endless night sky, and shone directly on Han Li's body.\"Whew!\"At the moment when the silvery-purple light fell on his body, Han Li's clothes instantly turned into ashes.His skin immediately shone with a silver light and became extremely translucent.Through his skin, it could even be seen that the muscles and bones in his body had also begun to change. Originally, it was only covered with a faint layer of silver luster, but now it had become as if it was wrapped in silver paste.A loud buzzing sound could be heard on the snow-capped peak.Countless silver light fragments replaced the original flying snow and scattered down, turning into a huge spherical light curtain that enveloped the entire mountain peak. Bursts of terrifying spiritual power fluctuations were emitted from it.As this fluctuation continued to strengthen, the entire mountain peak began to shake violently. Even the surrounding mountain range also became extremely unstable.Within a radius of a thousand miles, the earth was constantly shaking. Many places directly split open a long and winding crack, and some even caused the riverbed to change, causing the river to change its course.In the nearby dense primeval jungle, yellow dust rose everywhere, and countless beasts ran wildly in the forest, making loud roars.In the sky above the jungle, dense birds and flying beasts flapped their wings and flew out of the forest, covering a large area of the sky.\"Boom!\"Hundreds of miles away, a tall volcano that had been silent for more than ten thousand years, at this moment, under the continuous impact of this shock, erupted again.A large amount of dark red magma, wrapped in thick black smoke, spewed out from the crater of the volcano straight to the sky.Countless burning red rocks were first thrown high up, and soon fell down like a meteor shower, drawing a long tail in the night sky, passing through the layers of volcanic ash and smashing into the forest.A large area of the forest was immediately ignited with raging flames. In the billowing smoke, half of the night sky was illuminated with fiery red.In the entire mountain range, more than a dozen streams of light flew out from different places, all hovering in the sky hundreds of miles away from the silver light ball.Among these people, there were handsome young masters and graceful middle-aged women, but most of them were old men. Most of them were alone, and there were very few who were in groups of three or five.They were all rogue cultivators hidden in this mountain range, and their strength varied. Among them, the weakest was at the late Core Formation stage, and the strongest was only at the middle Void Refinement stage.Besides them, there were some people with strange appearances. Some had vertical horns on their heads, some had multicolored markings on their bodies, some were covered in a layer of fur, and some even had the head of a ferocious beast. They seemed to be demon cultivators.However, whether it was the human cultivators or the demon cultivators, at this moment, all of them looked at the top of the snow mountain with horror and doubt, but no one dared to approach to investigate.\"Such power, is there a Mahayana cultivator who is about to transcend the tribulation and ascend?\" A white robed Youth looked at the various strange phenomena on the snow mountain and said in surprise.Another thin old man who came here with him shook his head and said, \"I don't think so.It doesn't look like it. It doesn't look like a thunder tribulation at all. It looks like someone is practicing an extremely mysterious cultivation method and is about to achieve great success. That's why such a strange phenomenon is caused. \"\"Cultivation method?How is this possible \u2026 \"The white-robed young man sucked in a breath of cold air. He couldn't believe that a cultivation technique alone could cause such a large-scale Heaven and Earth Phenomenon.At this moment, a roar suddenly came from the top of the mountain, and a powerful wave of air suddenly swept in all directions in a ring with the snow mountain as the center.When the people who were hundreds of miles away saw this, they all turned into streams of light and flew backward. There was a demon cultivator with low cultivation who was caught by the air wave before he could retreat far. He was immediately beaten until blood spurted out of his mouth and his body was in tatters. He almost ended up dead.After fleeing for another hundred or so miles, everyone stopped and looked over with lingering fear.They saw that the spherical light screen that enveloped the entire snow mountain expanded again, covering a larger area. The entire snow mountain became blurry, and only a vague outline could be seen.\u2026At the same time.On the Nine Palace Peak of the Realm Temple, Taoist He Shan, who was as fat as a mountain of meat, was standing on the Star Gathering Platform. He looked at the Big Dipper that had changed in the night sky with a complicated expression.Previously, under Han Li's oppression, he was forced to destroy the communication array between the sect and the Immortal Realm, which could be considered as a complete betrayal of Spiritual Master Clarity.Now that this person was about to leave, he needed to think carefully about what methods the Patriarch in the Immortal Realm would use to investigate and how to deal with him.Besides, the Leng Yan Sect had been developing rapidly these years, openly and secretly absorbing many small and medium-sized forces to attach themselves to, and had the momentum to be on par with the Realm Temple. Once Han Li left, this Spirit Huan Domain would probably not be peaceful again \u2026Thinking of this, Taoist He Shan couldn't help but sigh.\u2026Coincidentally, on the square at the top of the Sacred Fire Peak of the Leng Yan Sect.Sima Jingming, who was dressed in a purple robe, was also holding the white jade railing with both hands, looking up at the night sky with a complicated expression.After a while, he let out a long breath and said as if he had been relieved of a heavy burden,\"Senior Han, you're finally going to leave \u2026\"Although the Leng Yan Sect had greatly increased in strength after absorbing the Tengui School, Han Li's existence was like an invisible mountain, pressing on his heart.Although their Icy Flames Sect didn't have a hostile relationship with Han Li and instead got along quite well with him, the existence of a person who could destroy a sect with a wave of his hand was tantamount to having a talisman that could explode at any time. No one would feel at ease.\u2026At this moment, in a remote cave abode on the Cloud Protruding Peak.Gu Yunyue, who was dressed in white, and Yu Menghan, who was dressed in a palace dress, were sitting opposite each other at the stone table in the courtyard.The latter was raising her small face, looking at the ring-shaped Big Dipper in the night sky and the strange silver-purple light pillar. Her eyes were a little blurred.\"This Elder Han really treats you well. Not only did he leave this cave abode to you, but he also left so many magic treasures and pills. These resources are no less than a small sect. It's more than enough for you to use until you reach the Spirit Severing stage.\" Gu Yunyue looked at her appearance and revealed a gentle smile, saying with a hint of ridicule.Yu Menghan was taken aback when she heard this, then she suddenly came back to her senses and said:\"Elder Han probably remembers the matter of me bringing him and sister Le'Er into the mansion, that's why he treats me so well.Actually, speaking of which, that bit of kindness has already been repaid long ago. Instead, I \u2026 owe Elder Han a bit more. \"Hearing this, Gu Yunyue smiled and shook her head without saying anything.The master and disciple didn't say anything more. In the small courtyard, it was silent.\u2026And in a cave abode halfway up the Cloud Protruding Peak.An old I, wearing a lotus crown and a grey robe, was sitting cross-legged in a secret room. It was Daoist White Stone.In front of him, there was an ancient book with a yellowish paper. On it were five ancient words, \"Mystic Water Refining Soul Record\".This ancient book was a superior ghost cultivation method from the Tengui School. It was an important secret book that would never be passed on to outsiders, so when Han Li suddenly appeared and casually gave it to him, he almost didn't dare to believe it.On the day he received it, he began to study it carefully. Now that he had cultivated it to the second level, the bottleneck of the early Core Formation stage that he had been stuck at for many years finally loosened a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLate at night.Above the pitch-black sky, the stars seemed abnormally dim, leaving only the ring-shaped Big Dipper, which was like a silver-purple sun, shining with a strange light.All of a sudden, the silvery-purple pillar of light that was over 1,000 feet in thickness receded and disappeared.\"Boom!\" A loud sound was heard!The ball-shaped light curtain that shrouded the entire mountain suddenly exploded. Countless silver lights were like countless fireflies flying all over the sky, illuminating most of the night sky.Looking from afar, it was as if the Milky Way from the Ninth Heaven had fallen to the earth.However, this beautiful scene did not last for too long. These silver lights seemed to be suddenly summoned. They suddenly gathered towards the top of the snowy peak, and all of them were absorbed into the body of a Youth whose whole body was shining with silver light.This person was none other than Han Li.Wave after wave of surging silver light surged toward him in a frenzy, but Han Li remained completely motionless with his eyes tightly shut and his hand seals.After an unknown period of time, his eyelashes trembled, and his eyes suddenly opened. His eyes were shining with blue light, which was incomparably clear. Thousands of stars were reflected in his eyes.The next moment, he let out a light shout, and a fog-like silver light sprayed out. After flickering for a moment, it gradually disappeared in the air.On his chest and abdomen, seven blue light spots were shining brightly.The seventh mysterious aperture was finally formed!The silver light that lingered around his body was also gradually fading away. A translucent film was formed on the surface of his skin, and there were faint silver flowing lights flowing on it.\"This is the Real Ji Film, the symbol of the Real Ji Body!Once the Big Dipper Yuan Power is completed, this body will be formed immediately! \"Han Li was overjoyed. He raised his arm and looked at the light film that wrapped his whole body. He found that it did not need to consume spiritual power to maintain. It was slightly cool to the touch, and there was no foreign feeling, as if it was a part of his body.He moved his Divine Sense, and the light film immediately shrank and stuck to his skin. After a burst of star-like light flashed, it actually merged into his body and disappeared.When he willed it again, the light membrane instantly appeared through his body.After experimenting a few times, Han Li was overjoyed in his heart. At the same time that he had mastered the True Polarity Membrane, he also discovered that the power of his Divine Sense had unexpectedly been completely restored.Now, in terms of the power of divine sense, ordinary True Immortals were far inferior to him.This was undoubtedly extremely good news to Han Li who was about to return to the Immortal Dimension.At this point, the abnormal movements within a thousand miles gradually calmed down. Even the erupting volcano gradually calmed down.Only the fire spreading in the forest could not be extinguished for a while.A few hundred li away, the rogue cultivators floating in the air raised their heads and looked into the distance, not knowing what to do.The white-robed Youth's back was already drenched in sweat. He muttered in a daze, \"Is this \u2026 the end?\"\"Maybe \u2026\" The skinny old man hesitated and said with some uncertainty.At this time, Han Li, who was on the Snow-capped Peak, did not have the slightest expression of joy on his face. Instead, his eyes were calm and his expression was somewhat solemn.Only he knew that the real test had just begun!Just now, at the moment when he achieved the True Polarity Body, the repulsive force from the realm had already appeared out of thin air and followed him like a shadow.Now, he only felt that the flow of air around him had instantly become stagnant, as if he had fallen into a swamp, and even his breathing had become a little difficult.This repulsive force was not unfamiliar to him. When he ascended from the Spiritual Realm, he had a brief feeling of it. But at that time, he was busy dealing with the Thunder Tribulation, so he did not pay too much attention to it.He took a deep breath and made a gesture with both hands. His lips opened slightly, and there was a burst of chanting from his mouth.There was a buzzing sound.Dozens of rays of light lit up from the surroundings at the same time. A stream of rich spiritual power flowed out from the spirit stones at the top of the stone pillars, and flowed into the formation along the lines on the stone pillars.The runes engraved on the ground and the surrounding stone pillars immediately lit up, and soon gathered into an extremely exquisite and complicated silver light pattern formation.This formation was called \"Void Spirit Pattern Formation\". It was a kind of space formation that he found in an ancient formation book in the Scriptures Pavilion of the Realm Temple.Although it could not reach the level of breaking the void, it could clear part of the space obstruction. For him now, it was also a great help.\"Boom!\" A loud sound rang out!Dozens of silver light pillars rose from the Snow-capped Peak at the same time, piercing straight into the dark clouds in the sky.At the moment when the light pillars pierced into the thick dark clouds, it suddenly turned into a huge spiral, spinning rapidly around the light pillars. At the same time, it also drove the surrounding snow to roll wildly.Thick bolts of lightning were like dark blue flood dragons, constantly churning and twisting around the pillar of light, emitting waves of muffled rumbling sounds.A group of individual cultivators who were still watching from afar were suddenly shocked when they saw this situation. They were afraid that there would be another strange phenomenon, so they took the initiative to retreat. This time, they directly flew a thousand miles away before stopping in bewilderment.At this time, Han Li, who was in the formation, stood up and waved his wrist. Dozens of black lights immediately flew out from his sleeves. They were nearly a hundred Star and Moon Treasure Mirrors, and they flew toward the surrounding light pillars.Previously, in order to refine these Star and Moon Treasured Mirrors with the power of space, he had not only used up all the Yin Chen Stones stored in the Heavenly Ghost Sect, he had even used up all the Yin Chen Stones he had obtained from Tong Renjue's storage bag.After these Star and Moon Treasure Mirrors flew into the light pillars, they immediately rushed up along with the light and went into the dark clouds.Han Li made a gesture with his hand, and after silently chanting for a while, his eyes suddenly flashed with blue light, and he shouted \"Explode\".\"Rumble \u2026\"Dozens of earth-shaking explosions sounded one after another, and countless silver starlight exploded at the top of the sky, turning into a silver light curtain, and opened up a silver light area in the vortex of the dark clouds.At this moment, light flashed from Han Li's body, and he abruptly leaped into the air, flying directly toward that area.The inside of the vortex was chaotic, and everywhere was filled with gray fog. Hundreds and thousands of grayish-white space cracks, long and short, were scattered around the silver light area, appearing extremely unstable.Han Li's gaze swept across, and he saw that from time to time, there would be small grayish-white light blades flying out from those cracks.The surrounding dark clouds would immediately be cut into pieces when they came into contact with it. Even a flash of lightning not far away was cut by a light blade the moment it appeared, and instantly split into two and dissipated.With the continuous flashing of the surrounding gray light blades, the silver light area supported by countless starlight was also eroded, and the area was constantly shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye.Seeing a large area of silver light being swallowed by the dark clouds again, Han Li no longer hesitated. He immediately let out a low roar, and his body suddenly shone with a golden light. His body expanded sharply, and he transformed into a golden giant ape of hundreds of meters tall.After he took a deep breath, a blood mark split open between the giant ape's eyebrows. A cloud of black gas gushed out from it, and a black eyeball suddenly emerged.A black light flashed deep in the pupil of the eyeball, and a slender black light beam was ejected from it.As soon as the black line was spurted out, it trembled violently, then it suddenly turned into a pitch-black beam of light that was as thick as a bowl. It disappeared into the void in a flash.However, the next moment, there was a sudden roar from the depths of the vortex of dark clouds.Immediately afterward, the entire sky suddenly became silent as if the entire space was frozen. Even the rotating dark clouds and the flying snow all stopped in an instant.In the depths of the vortex, a gray-white light wall with a circumference of less than a hundred meters, but its shape was extremely irregular. It appeared somewhat vaguely in the dark clouds.A blue light flashed in the giant ape's eyes. He raised his arms, and two bright silver lights lit up on his mountain-like fists. A pair of ferocious gloves with white bone spurs suddenly appeared, wrapping his entire fists.After a loud roar, the giant ape raised all the spiritual power in his body. Suddenly, there was a trace of golden light coming out of his body, flowing into the silver gloves along his arms.The gloves suddenly shone with silver light, and it doubled in size somewhat incongruously.At the same time, on Han Li's chest and abdomen, seven clusters of blue light suddenly shone brightly. His muscles swelled again, and his arms suddenly became thicker.He suddenly raised his fist and smashed it at the gray-white light wall.A cluster of silver light suddenly rushed out of the fist, and it expanded rapidly in the air, turning into a silver hydra head phantasm the size of a house, and it rushed straight into the depths of the vortex.\"Rumble\" a loud noise was heard!The entire sky shook violently. On the gray-white light wall in the depths of the vortex, there was a burst of sound of a mirror surface breaking. Dense cracks like a spider web appeared in it, almost crawling over the entire wall.However, even so, the gray-white light wall still did not break. On the contrary, the area of silver light that was previously supported by the vortex collapsed in this violent shock.The originally still dark clouds rolled wildly again, and countless gray-white cracks gradually expanded, gathering towards the giant ape.Upon seeing this, the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into immediately took a step in the void. After a few flashes, he appeared in front of the gray-white light wall like a ghost.Once again, he raised all the spiritual power in his body, and the light flowed on his arms. Under the golden hair, golden scales turned up, and his muscles quickly doubled. The seven mysterious apertures on his chest shone brightly, and the Sky Splitting Gloves on his hands shone brightly.A gradually solidified silver dragon head emerged on it, from which came bursts of low-pitched roars of a hydra.\"Break for me!\"The giant golden ape spoke in the human language, making a thunderous sound, and punched the gray-white light wall.\"Boom\", there was a loud noise.On the silver glove on the giant ape's right hand, the silver-white bone spurs broke inch by inch, and the silver dragon head and the glove burst at the same time.A round of silver sun suddenly lit up in the depths of the sky, blooming thousands of bright lights that could not be looked at directly, almost swallowing the entire gray-white light wall.Immediately afterward, there was a crisp sound of porcelain breaking!The gray-white light wall in front of him suddenly shattered with a crack, breaking open a gap about ten feet high, revealing a gray space behind it.At the same time, an extremely strong spatial fluctuation that Han Li had never felt before came from the breach.His eyes flickered slightly, and the golden light on his body suddenly flashed. He turned back into a human form, and in a flash, he disappeared into the breach.As soon as he entered, a dozen space cracks behind him, together with the dark clouds, swallowed the gray light wall.After a few seconds, the silver-white light beam above the snow-capped peak converged and gradually dimmed. The vortex formed in the sky also gradually collapsed, and the space cracks mixed in it also gradually closed up.The sky full of snow swept down again, except for the whistling wind on the peak, everything returned to silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs far as the eye could see, multicolored streams of light surged violently and disorderly, converging into an earth-shattering torrent that rolled back and collided with each other, emitting deafening noises!From time to time, white and misty spatial cracks would appear in the streams of light, emitting an astonishing suction force and emitting a humming sound.Even if it was a Mahayana cultivator with exceedingly high cultivation, or a high-level demonic beast with an almost indestructible fleshly body, if they were the slightest bit careless, their souls would be destroyed, and they would even lose the chance to reincarnate.This was the interface gap!At this moment, Han Li was like a person who didn't know how to swim, and was suddenly thrown into a vast and boundless raging wave.Although he had expected the level of danger in the interface gap, and knew that it wouldn't be easy to pass through, he didn't expect it to be like this.The spatial storms that filled the surroundings were many times more powerful than the spatial storms that he had passed through when he ascended from the Human Realm to the Spiritual Realm. If it wasn't for the fact that his current fleshly body had been forged into a True Extreme Body, and that he had swallowed and cultivated countless spiritual materials and cultivation techniques that allowed his fleshly body to be reborn, he was afraid that the moment he entered this place, he would have been crushed into pieces.His entire body had long been covered by a simple and unadorned white bone armor, and it was precisely the Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor that was formed from the many treasures of the Spirit Huan Realm. Under the tremendous suction force that rose and fell in the surroundings, his body seemed to be swaying unsteadily.He took a deep breath, and the bone armor emitted an incomparably dazzling white light. The treasured umbrellas, shields, and * * on it all shone brightly, emitting a sharp whistling sound. Then, all of them shot out from the bone armor, and turned into white treasured umbrellas and shields that revolved around Han Li.These things revolved, and then suddenly merged into one, turning into a layer of solid and thick shield that enveloped his body. It emitted a dazzling white light, and actually seemed to have the effect of isolating the surrounding spatial fluctuations.Only then did Han Li's figure stabilize a little.He looked at the bone armor on his body, and nodded in satisfaction.Back then, he had refined the Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor in order to deal with the spatial storms in the gap between realms. The materials used had been specially selected. Several of the main materials, such as the Eight Treasures Exquisite Jade, contained the spatial attribute. Now, it seemed that he had not been disappointed.Blue light flashed through his eyes a few times, and he flew forward as a streak of azure light.The surrounding spatial storms surged over, but they were all blocked by the Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor.However, after the time it took for an incense stick to burn, he frowned again.With the protection of the armor artifact, even though it seemed like he would be fine for the time being, his speed was extremely slow as he traversed through the windstorms. From the moment he entered until now, he had probably only flown a mere hundred li.If it was just a matter of time, it wouldn't be a big deal. After all, this was a weak space node between the two worlds. If he advanced slowly, he would one day reach the Immortal World. However, he could clearly feel that after the armor was bombarded by the storm, the spiritual power contained in it was rapidly being consumed.\"Originally, I wanted to save some strength to deal with sudden danger, but now it seems that I can't.\" Han Li muttered to himself.In the next moment, his entire body suddenly emitted a seven-colored light. It was as dazzling as the sun.The cry of a phoenix erupted into the heavens, and it transformed into a gargantuan bird that was several hundred feet in length.This was the Heavenly Phoenix Transformation of the 12 Awakening Transformations!The Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor automatically disintegrated into pieces of bone fragments that stuck to various parts of the Heavenly Phoenix's body. The white light barrier wasn't affected in the slightest.The Heavenly Phoenix spread its wings and turned into a seven-colored phantom. It flew forward at an incomparably fast speed. Its speed was many times faster than before.The surrounding spatial storms attacked, but as soon as they touched the Heavenly Phoenix's body, a seven-colored light erupted from its body, and the storms automatically slid away.The Heavenly Phoenix True Spirit had the ability to control the power of space. It flew through the spatial storms like a fish in water.A trace of excitement appeared in Han Li's eyes. He let out a long cry and suddenly increased his speed again. He shuttled through the endless spatial storms and quickly advanced.Time slowly passed. There was no change of day and night in the interface gap. However, he estimated that almost a day had passed.During this day, he had encountered many difficulties and dangers. It was even longer than a year's time.There were not only spatial storms in the interface gap. There were also other unpredictable dangers lurking. There were even some strange creatures that took up residence and attacked him several times.Fortunately, he had the Brightsight Spirit Eyes and the Heavenly Phoenix's ability to control space. He managed to survive without any mishaps.At this moment, the seven-colored light around the Heavenly Phoenix's body was much dimmer than before. There was also a trace of exhaustion in its eyes.Maintaining this transformation for a long time consumed a lot of his physical strength. However, this was secondary. Han Li was worried about the armor artifact on his body.Cracks had already appeared on the surface of the armor. The white barrier around it was only a thin layer. It wasn't even one-third of its peak strength.\"If I had known this would happen, I would have spent a few more days to refine another treasure \u2026\"Han Li laughed bitterly in his heart. In the end, he gave up on this idea. After all, there was no turning back. It was too late to say anything now.He took a deep breath. The seven-colored light around his body shone brightly. His flying speed increased again.As a result, after flying forward for less than a moment, his eyes suddenly lit up and he let out a soft cry of surprise.He saw a faint white light in the spatial storm in front of him. Although it was weak, it appeared firmly in the spatial storm.\"Could it be \u2026\"Han Li was startled. A possibility appeared in his mind. He unconsciously urged the escape light to increase his speed again. He quickly flew toward the white light.The further he went, the brighter the white light became. An inexplicable and noble aura exuded from it. It was as if it was the holy land of countless interfaces. It was high and unreachable.He vaguely remembered this aura. It was the aura of the Celestial World!\"Finally \u2026\" Han Li was excited and let out a long sigh of relief.His luck was not bad. Otherwise, if the Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor was broken, he would probably be buried in this interface gap today.Although his physical body was quite tired, the scene in front of him still made him feel refreshed.As long as he could return to the Celestial World, he would naturally have a way to find the huge organization that wanted him. Then, he would find the truth about his amnesia and serious injuries.\"Huh!\"After flying forward for a distance, Han Li was slightly startled. His flying figure slowed down.He saw that in the spatial turbulence not far ahead, there was a huge yellow object floating. It was hundreds of miles in size and round. At first glance, it looked like a huge bubble.When the surrounding rolling spatial storm touched the huge bubble, it was immediately bounced off. It could not damage it at all.This mysterious bubble was not empty. He could vaguely see something.A layer of blue light appeared in Han Li's eyes. He looked at it intently. Soon, his face sank.His Bright Light Spirit Eyes could not see through the bubble. There was a strange power inside that blocked his vision!A trace of curiosity arose in Han Li's heart, but he quickly shook his head.This bubble was quite strange. His current situation was not good. It was better not to cause more trouble. It was more important to reach the Celestial World as soon as possible.With this thought, the Heavenly Phoenix that Han Li transformed into spread its wings. It made a turn and flew past the yellow bubble.At this moment, the spatial storm around him suddenly surged violently.Boom!A huge force came out and hit the Heavenly Phoenix that he had transformed into.\"What is this!\" Han Li was shocked.This force was so huge that it was definitely not under his full strength.The Heavenly Phoenix's body was sent flying, and it crashed into the yellow bubble involuntarily.The yellow bubble could easily bounce off the spatial storm. After touching the Heavenly Phoenix, not only did it not bounce off, but it also made a soft \"puff\" sound. The Heavenly Phoenix's body directly sank into it.Han Li was struck by a rush of dizziness, but after flapping his wings several times in quick succession, he was able to barely stabilize himself.Although the force of the collision was great, it could not cause any damage to his current physical body.As a result, when he looked around, he was suddenly stunned.This was an extremely calm yellow world. The turbulent spatial turbulence outside had all disappeared. The air was filled with yellow light, and there was a piece of land that was hundreds of miles large floating below. It looked like an island.The spiritual energy of heaven and earth in this yellow space was extremely rich. It was a hundred times stronger than the best spiritual land in the Spirit Huan Domain. The island was full of lush forests. Every tree looked at least a thousand years old.There were all kinds of spiritual materials in the forest, and they were all thousands of years old. There were also many spiritual herbs that were tens of thousands of years old. Most of them were species that he did not recognize.This island was simply full of treasures.After a moment of silence, a rainbow light flashed on Han Li's body, and he turned back into his human form. He took out a blue elixir and swallowed it.This elixir was called the Heavenly Star Elixir. It was a secret elixir from the Realm Spiritual Temple. It was made from several kinds of strange spiritual herbs that could absorb part of the power of the stars. For him, who cultivated the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique, it was the best elixir for recovery.The Heavenly Star Elixir turned into a warm current and quickly flowed through his body.It was as if a strong life force was injected into his tired body, and he quickly recovered.Han Li's expression relaxed. He did not rashly land on the ground. Instead, he activated his Brightsight Spirit Eyes and carefully examined his surroundings.He felt that there was something fishy about what happened just now. It was as if someone had done it on purpose.Yet, at this moment, a roar that shook thousands of miles came from below.The entire island rumbled and shook. A huge yellow cloud rose from the forest and flew towards Han Li like lightning. In the blink of an eye, it pounced in front of him.He could faintly see a huge hazy figure in the yellow cloud. It seemed to be a giant.Boom!A huge yellow fist stretched out from the yellow cloud. The skin on its surface was yellow and dry, like the roots of a tree. It was extremely rough.The moment it appeared, it brought with it an indescribably terrifying force and smashed towards Han Li.Before the fist arrived, the nearby void was already violently fluctuating.Han Li's pupils shrank. With a low shout, the seven spots of blue light on his lower abdomen suddenly shone brightly. He activated the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique with all his might.His entire body faintly emitted starlight. Seven thick starlight twined around his body, and he similarly struck out with his fist.Boom!The void around him suddenly exploded, and ripples could be seen with the naked eye.After the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique reached completion, even without transforming, the huge force contained in his fist was already comparable to that of the yellow-turbaned giant.The two fists collided.An earth-shattering bang resounded, and the surrounding void suddenly distorted. Then, circles of airwaves suddenly erupted, and instantly formed a white hurricane that shot towards the surroundings.Han Li was sent flying by a burst of enormous force, and only after flying for several thousand feet did he just barely manage to stop himself.The giant's body in the yellow cloud was also clearly shaken. He took two steps back before he could stabilize his body.Immediately after, the yellow cloud around the giant was swept away by the hurricanes, revealing the figure within.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li's figure flickered. The translucent film covering his body had a faint silver flow, and he stabilized his figure again.Although the huge power contained in the opponent's punch made him shocked, it didn't cause any damage to his physical body under the amazing defense of his True Extreme Body.As a result, his pupils shrank slightly when he glanced down.Standing a few hundred feet away was a yellow-skinned giant with a height of two to three hundred feet. His entire body was covered with strange spirit patterns, and his facial features were extremely ugly. He had a flat nose and a wide mouth. The strangest thing was that he didn't have a pair of eyes, only a single huge vertical eye. A murky light flickered in his grey pupil.This giant looked muddle-headed, but it gave Han Li a faint wild aura comparable to a true immortal, which made his eyes twitch a few times.This had nothing to do with the depth of the opponent's cultivation. It was completely an intuition of his.The Cyclops Giant faltered slightly upon seeing that Han Li was completely unscathed after taking his punch, and he let loose a thunderous roar of fury as a vast expanse of yellow light appeared over his body, and he rushed toward Han Li with all his might.Seeing this, Han Li quickly chanted, and the golden light on his body expanded wildly. He turned into a golden giant ape with a height of more than two hundred meters.Seven blue star patterns appeared on the chest and abdomen of the giant ape, shining brightly and emitting a large amount of starlight. The starlight and the golden light on his body surface made his body expand a little more.He clenched one of his big hands into a fist, and his arm became thicker out of thin air. He punched toward the one-eyed giant in the void.The void in front of him was violently distorted, and a golden fist shadow the size of a hill appeared. There was a trace of starlight in it, making the fist shadow almost materialize.The giant roared, and he didn't stop. He waved his giant fist and greeted the golden fist shadow like lightning.\"Boom\", there was a loud noise that shook the earth and the mountains!This time, the one-eyed giant's huge body was beaten back, falling from the sky like a meteorite, and smashed heavily on the island.The entire island shook violently, and a huge crater was formed, filling the air with smoke and dust.The giant golden-furred ape's body swayed, and in the next instant, it appeared above the giant crater. Its arms blurred, transforming into countless overlapping golden fist projections that whistled downward.The cyclops giant leapt up from the ground, seemingly uninjured. However, it let out a low roar of anger and stomped the ground.Strange yellow patterns suddenly appeared on the surface of his body, emitting a sparkling yellow light that quickly spread to the surrounding ground.Ka ka ka!Wherever the sparkling yellow light spread, the soil on the ground immediately shattered and turned into countless yellow crystal sand. As if it had a mind of its own, it flew up and wrapped around his body. In an instant, it formed an extremely tough yellow crystal sand armor on his body.The pitter-patter of rain hitting the banana leaves suddenly rang out!Countless golden fist projections crashed into the one-eyed giant's body, exploding with dense golden halos before shattering one after another.The one-eyed giant's body didn't move at all, and the crystal sand armor on his body was not damaged at all.Seeing this, the giant golden-furred ape that Han Li transformed into was slightly startled. His figure paused for a moment, and he hurriedly retreated.The one-eyed giant of the giant coldly looked at the giant ape in mid-air. He raised his foot and stomped the ground again. The yellow spirit patterns on his body flashed.\"Buzz!\" Then, a circle of yellow ripples spread out, and enveloped the surrounding area of more than ten miles in an instant.The giant ape only felt his body sinking halfway, and the surrounding gravity suddenly increased by several times. It was as if he was pulled down by an invisible hand. He could no longer stand in mid-air, and he fell to the ground.\"Gravity manipulation!\" Han Li's heart thumped.But as soon as this thought appeared in his mind, the giant ape that he transformed into had already smashed heavily on the ground and sank down. His feet sank a few meters into the ground, and countless gravel splashed.Almost at the next moment, the one-eyed giant's figure suddenly appeared, and a giant yellow fist with earth-shattering momentum smashed toward the giant ape that couldn't escape.The fist stirred up a turbulent wind, drawing a huge white mark in the air.The golden-furred giant ape crossed his arms, and the surface was instantly covered with dense golden scales.\"Bang\", a loud noise!The giant ape only felt a great force passing through his arms to his whole body, and his body sank again under a huge shock.The one-eyed giant's figure shook slightly, and his two huge fists became blurred. Countless huge fist projections smashed at the giant ape like a storm.The giant ape had no choice but to wave his hands again and again, trying his best to resist, but he couldn't help but secretly complain.Although his physical body was tough now, and he wasn't afraid of the opponent's attack, under the enhancement of gravity, he couldn't get rid of it for a while. His body kept sinking, and now his waist was almost in the ground.If this continued, he was afraid that he would be buried alive by the opponent.At this moment, a strange change suddenly occurred!Spatial fluctuations erupted over 1,000 feet behind the Cyclops Giant, and a humanoid, half-horse monster that was over 1,000 feet tall suddenly emerged in a soundless manner with its entire body enshrouded within a gust of fierce azure winds.Its entire body was dark green, and its lower body was no different from that of a horse. However, its entire body was not furred, and was instead covered in a thick layer of green scales. Its upper body was that of a sturdy naked man, and what was even more surprising was that on its shoulders, there were actually three identical heads, side by side.As soon as it appeared, its body was still in the air, and its muscular arm had already raised high, holding a tens of meters long blue thunder spear in its hand. It suddenly threw it toward the back of the one-eyed giant.On the thunder spear, the blue arc jumped wildly like boiling water. With a flash of light in the air, it suddenly pierced the back of the one-eyed giant.The giant was originally fighting with the giant ape transformed by Han Li. When he felt the change behind him, it was too late to dodge.As he shouted, the spirit patterns on his body shone with yellow light at the same time. The ground within a few miles nearby suddenly trembled. The yellow crystal sand on the ground behind him suddenly flew up and intertwined, turning into a brown sand wall to block behind him.\"Poof\", there was a soft sound.The blue thunder spear easily penetrated the sand wall and pierced into the one-eyed giant's body.Then there was a loud \"boom\"!The blue lightning spear shone brightly, and countless electric arcs shot out, exploding directly.The one-eyed giant let out a fierce roar. A big hole exploded in his lower abdomen. A large amount of reddish-brown blood splashed around the wound.Meanwhile, the half-man, half-horse mutant beast landed several thousand feet away in a flash. A hint of elation appeared on all three of its faces, but it only lasted for a brief moment before its expression stiffened.Because he found that the thunder spear did not pierce the giant's heart as he expected, but it penetrated from the upper abdomen. Even if it burst, it didn't give the opponent a fatal blow.It turned out that when the thunder spear pierced the sand wall, the one-eyed giant had already raised the ground by controlling the crystal sand, avoiding the vital point.But even so, the giant was still heavily injured. At this moment, blood flowed from the corner of his mouth, and a large amount of crystal sand on his body fell off, revealing irregular patches, making him look like a dilapidated old wall that had been eroded by wind and frost.Due to this sudden scene, the gravitational field that shrouded the surrounding suddenly relaxed. The giant ape transformed by Han Li jumped out of the pit without saying a word. After a few flashes, he landed thousands of meters away.When his gaze swept across the centaur, his pupils constricted slightly.Judging from the aura emitted by the other party, and the fact that it was good at concealment, it was most likely related to him being knocked into this bubble space.He was not in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he focused his attention on the two monsters in front of him.At this moment, the centaur leapt forward on its four hooves. A strong wind swept around it, and it suddenly charged towards the one-eyed giant. A huge thunder spear had already condensed in its hand, and it held it with both hands, thrusting it towards the back of the giant's heart.The one-eyed giant revealed a ruthless look in its eyes. It suddenly let out a roar, and light burst forth from its body.Countless yellow crystal sand filled the surroundings and gathered together. The instant the centaur approached, it immediately turned into hundreds of dark yellow barbs, thrusting towards it.The sound of something tearing through the air rang out!A hint of surprise flashed across the centaur's six eyes. Azure light shone from its body as it held the lightning spear horizontally in front of it. Countless strands of lightning shot out from the spear, instantly turning into a huge lightning net in front of it to block the attack.Bang, bang, bang \u2026The yellow barbs continuously struck the blue lightning net, producing a series of collision sounds. The centaur was pushed back several hundred meters by the impact of the force.However, after this strike, the one-eyed giant couldn't help but open its mouth and spit out a mouthful of reddish-brown blood. The anger in its single eye grew even more intense.It glanced warily at Han Li, who was on the other side in the form of a giant golden ape. Its huge body twisted slightly, and it retreated over a hundred meters, forming a stalemate with the giant ape and the centaur.At the hole in its lower abdomen, an earthen-yellow vortex of flowing light slowly appeared. As it slowly rotated, the flesh around the wound gradually turned from red to black. It directly turned into rock, reflecting a faint light.Not only that, but as the vortex of flowing light continued to rotate, the area of the rock around the wound grew larger and larger. It was like the surface of a lake had frozen, and soon, the hole was completely sealed.Seeing this, Han Li's body flashed with golden light. His figure rapidly shrank, returning to his human form. With a flick of his wrist, a purple High Zenith Invisibility Talisman suddenly appeared between his fingers.With a flash of purple light, his figure gradually became blurry, and he disappeared on the spot.Seeing this, the one-eyed giant was slightly taken aback.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the one-eyed giant felt the unfriendly gaze of the centaur, he didn't care about Han Li anymore. A cold light flashed in his one-eyed eyes. He half-squatted and put on full alert.The eyes of one of the centaur's heads flashed with lightning, and the lightning patterns on the green scales all over its body lit up. Blue arcs of lightning shot out and surrounded its entire body. Then it put its hands in front of it.\"Chi la\"!A lightning halberd that was almost as tall as his body appeared in his hand. Arcs of electricity coiled around the body of the halberd, and it was clearly formed from lightning. However, the lightning on it was condensed, and there were many strange patterns on it. It looked like a powerful magic treasure, far more powerful than the lightning spear from before.He raised the lightning halberd in his hand, and his two hind hooves stomped on the ground. His figure rushed out as fast as lightning, rushing straight to the one-eyed giant.Before his figure arrived, he shook the lightning halberd in his hand. A dense halberd shadow appeared, and it shot at the one-eyed giant one step ahead.The giant groaned, lifted one foot suddenly, and stomped heavily on the ground. The earth suddenly shook. A large amount of smoke mixed with countless yellow crystal sand flew up, like a yellow sand tornado spinning into his hand. The yellow light condensed and turned into a giant long rod that was nearly a thousand meters long.As soon as he held the long rod with both hands, the body of the rod immediately glowed with a faint yellow light. He strode forward and swept at the lightning halberd shadow.In an instant, the shadow of the rod covered half of the void like a mountain, and it directly shrouded the lightning halberd shadow.\"Boom boom boom\"A series of explosive sounds rang out, and the menacing lightning halberd shadows were shattered by the rod shadows one after another. They turned into a mass of dazzling blue lightning, and gradually dissipated.At this moment, a hole suddenly appeared in the dense rod shadow like snowflakes. A blue lightning halberd pierced out from it, aiming straight at the giant's throat.The one-eyed giant had expected it. He retracted the long rod in his hand, and the rod shadow overlapped back into the rod. He then flicked it to the side and pushed the lightning halberd away with a \"bang\".The lightning halberd drew an arc in the air, then the spear head turned and pointed at the giant again.The centaur's arms kept moving, and the lightning halberd in his hand immediately shook in front of him like a dragon. Countless blue halberd shadows pressed at the giant.In the vast halberd shadows, tiny electric arcs kept jumping. Even the air began to fill with a pungent smell of burning.The one-eyed giant turned into a blurry yellow shadow with the long rod in his hand, like a yellow Kun Peng spreading its huge wings, pouncing at the blue halberd shadow.For a time, the crackling sound was endless, and the yellow electric light intertwined. They were in a stalemate for a while.In midair, loud explosions erupted from time to time. If it wasn't a ray of yellow light suddenly collapsing, then it was a ball of lightning exploding with a bang. Circle after circle of enormous airwaves swept out in all directions, causing the space to distort and tremble.Under the intense battle between the two, the huge bubble that shrouded this area was like the surface of a sea swept by a gale. Its surface fluctuated violently as if it could collapse at any time.After concealing himself, Han Li had already taken advantage of this opportunity to appear around 4,000 to 5,000 feet away from the two colossi, and he was appraising this intense battle with rapt attention.Originally, he planned to take advantage of the battle between the two to escape quietly, leaving this mysterious bubble area and heading to the Immortal World as soon as possible. But the scene before him made a trace of hesitation flash in his eyes.After his expression changed for a while, he finally made a decision and didn't leave immediately.The rumbling tremors lasted for an unknown amount of time. The light and shadows in the sky that were originally evenly matched finally began to show a slight change.The one-eyed giant seemed to be affected by his previous injuries. His physical strength gradually weakened, and the speed at which he swung the long rod gradually slowed down.In contrast, the centaur became more and more courageous as he fought. The dense blue halberd shadows began to take the initiative, crushing towards the rod shadows.Amidst the chaotic light and shadows, an earthy yellow halo suddenly lit up above the one-eyed giant's feet.He suddenly let out a loud roar, and the ground under his feet suddenly shook violently. Rolling crystal sand rolled up from the ground, immediately turning into a monstrous sand curtain that was thousands of meters tall, soaring into the sky.Under the impact of the sand curtain, the halberd shadows instantly collapsed. The centaur holding the lightning halberd was also caught off guard, and was blocked on the other side of the sand curtain.When the one-eyed giant saw this, he turned around and fled.Immediately afterwards, the surface of the sand curtain shone with dazzling yellow light, becoming extremely solid!The centaur's three humanoid faces showed a trace of contempt at the same time. Then, the left head turned slightly, and looked forward with the middle head.The two pairs of eyes flickered with green and blue light respectively. Where their gazes met, a strong fluctuation suddenly appeared in the void.Strands of blue lightning flashed out of thin air, and numerous azure wind blades were born. They intertwined with each other and condensed together. Very quickly, they condensed into an azure and blue lightning ball that was 70 to 80 feet in size.The two-colored lightning ball flashed in the void and suddenly smashed at the yellow sand curtain.The sand curtain was smashed by the lightning ball, and it suddenly bulged backward. It didn't shatter for a while, and it blocked the lightning ball.However, at that moment, the ball of lightning emitted a brilliant light and exploded.An earth-shattering loud noise!Blue electric arcs bounced and shuttled back and forth like tiny wandering dragons. Their bodies were wrapped in incomparably sharp cyan wind blades, crazily rushing in all directions. In an instant, they tore a big hole in the middle of the yellow sand curtain, which was dozens of feet in size.The centaur's figure flickered, and it passed through the big hole in the sand curtain, chasing straight ahead. Its speed was as fast as lightning. In the blink of an eye, it ran thousands of meters away.However, in the next moment, it was slightly startled. There was nothing in front of it. Where was the one-eyed giant?But at this moment, somewhere behind the crystal sand, a blazing sun suddenly rose up, emitting a dazzling light. The Cyclops Giant's figure reappeared. Its aura was somewhat weak, and its ugly face revealed a hint of savagery.He didn't escape at all, but hid in the sand curtain, waiting for the centaur to chase.At this moment, it was the original gray eye on its head that was shining brightly.The centaur sensed that something was amiss, and it abruptly turned around. Light erupted from its hand, and it fiercely hurled the blue lightning halberd toward the giant's hiding place.Almost at the same time, the one-eyed giant's eye also flashed, and a thick white light shot out from it.Before the lightning halberd came into contact with the white light, it suddenly blurred and disappeared into thin air. In the next instant, it suddenly appeared in front of the cyclops giant and stabbed into its heart. Countless arcs of lightning shot out, blasting a massive hole in the cyclops giant's chest, and it fell back heavily.Almost at the same time, the white light also flashed and hit the centaur that couldn't dodge in time.Its body suddenly seemed to be shrouded by a strange wave, and its body became extremely stiff. Whether it was the movement or the spiritual power in its body, it was a hundred times slower than before!In a panic, it desperately urged the spiritual power in its body, trying to break through this strange wave.It was a pity that this wave seemed weak, but it was quite strange. Even with its vast spiritual power, it couldn't break it.Right at this moment, the void behind him flashed, and a giant golden-furred ape leaped out from it. Its two fists shone with golden starlight, and it punched out at lightning speed towards the two heads of the giant golden-furred ape.The centaur was shocked, and its two heads subconsciously shrank, trying to dodge.At the same time, the green whirlwind that shrouded its body suddenly left its body, and turned into a lifelike dark green wind dragon. A sharp horn condensed on its head, and it pounced toward the giant golden ape.However, the giant ape didn't have the slightest intention to dodge. A layer of translucent film appeared around its body, and a faint silver light flowed on its surface. Then, it pounced toward the giant golden ape.Two cracking sounds resounded!Because the centaur's movement was too slow, it couldn't dodge in time. Its left and middle heads were hit by the fists, and broke into pieces with a \"pu\" sound. White brain matter mixed with blood splashed out.At this time, the green wind dragon also pounced in front of the giant golden ape. The sharp horn on its head suddenly became dazzling, and countless green runes emerged.\"Chi la\"!The layer of translucent film was torn apart by the sharp horn, and a long wound was suddenly cut on the giant ape's chest. Blood swarmed out.The giant ape let out a low groan in pain. Its body leaned to one side, and it used one hand to protect its chest. Then, its other hand pounded toward the centaur's third head like a lightning bolt.A look of horror appeared in the eyes of the centaur's remaining head. Then, a black light flashed in its eyes, and innumerable black runes emerged. They then revolved around its body.Then, a strange scene appeared!The centaur's figure flashed, and it disappeared into thin air.Han Li had transformed into a giant golden ape. But, he didn't hesitate in the slightest. Then, he spread his enormous spirit sense in all directions. At the same time, a layer of blue light emerged in his eyes, and he quickly swept his surroundings.However, he still couldn't find any trace of the centaur even after using his spirit sense and Brightsight Spirit Eyes at the same time. It seemed as if the centaur had really disappeared into thin air.The green wind dragon took advantage of this opportunity to fly up and down around the giant ape's body. The sharp horn on its head was unstoppable, and it left several wounds on the giant ape's body.The golden-furred giant ape waved its arms in a frenzy to protect its vital parts. Then, a blue light flashed in its eyes. At the same time, its glabella split open, and black Qi surged out to form a pitch-black demonic eye.It was the Law Destruction Eye.The Brightsight Spirit Eyes and the Law Destruction Eye shone brightly at the same time, and they shot out two blue and one black spiritual lights.The three spiritual lights flashed in the air, and they fused together to form a black and blue light ball.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Break!\"The golden-furred ape opened its mouth and spouted a cloud of azure light. This cloud of light then fused with the black and blue ball of light in a flash. The surface of the ball glowed with spiritual light, and countless black and blue runes of different sizes appeared on its surface.\"Buzz!\"Streaks of black and blue light shot out from the ball of light in all directions. They instantly intertwined to form a huge black and blue net that enshrouded an area with a radius of several kilometers.This was an ability that Han Li had comprehended by chance. It was a combination of the Brightsight Spirit Eyes and the Law Destruction Eye. However, the magic power in his body was almost instantly drained as soon as he used this technique.As soon as the huge black and blue net was formed, a certain part of it suddenly trembled and became a little twisted. It seemed as if it had touched something.The giant ape's body suddenly transformed into a golden shadow. It shook off the azure wind dragon and pounced toward that direction like a bolt of lightning.The azure wind dragon let out an angry roar and chased after the giant ape.The giant ape's body was like the wind, and it appeared in the huge net in the blink of an eye. It didn't wait for the wind dragon to catch up to it. Instead, it extended a palm that was radiating golden light and fiercely slapped it down.A loud sound rang out in the air, and violent fluctuations started to appear.A large number of black runes appeared, then collapsed at the same time. A huge humanoid figure stumbled out. It was the centaur mutant beast. Its remaining head was filled with an expression of extreme fear.Before it could react, another huge furry fist that was wrapped in golden light came crashing down.The centaur mutant beast's movements were still extremely slow. It hurriedly crossed its arms in an attempt to protect its head.At this moment, a cold snort sounded from the giant ape's mouth.The mutant beast felt as if its brain had been ruthlessly hammered by an awl. It let out a blood-curdling screech, and its movements suddenly stiffened.The golden fist instantly passed through the gap between the mutant beast's arms and struck its remaining head.Bang!The beast's last head suddenly exploded like a watermelon. Its huge body twitched and fell toward the ground. The azure wind dragon that had been following the giant ape was just about to stab the giant ape's heart with its sharp horn. However, it let out a wail at this moment, and its body collapsed inch by inch.\"Puchi!\" A green shadow rushed out from the mutant beast's headless corpse.\"Eh?\"The eyes of the giant ape that Han Li had transformed into flashed as he exclaimed in surprise.This green shadow was a miniature centaur wrapped in a green whirlwind. It also had three heads and seemed to have taken solid form. It wasn't a divine soul, but rather an existence similar to a cultivator's Nascent Soul.Black light flashed from one of the miniature centaur's heads, and it vanished into thin air amid a string of afterimages in its wake.Han Li let loose a low cry as black light flashed from his glabella. His Law Destruction Eye was unleashed, and a thin black thread shot forth from it before vanishing into thin air.The space a thousand feet away trembled, and the miniature centaur stumbled out. Its three faces were filled with shock.Suddenly, silver light flashed around it, and a series of crisscrossed silver chains of fire appeared. They instantly formed a huge silver flame net that tightened toward the center.As a result, azure light flashed from the left head of the miniature centaur, and the azure whirlwind revolving around its body transformed into an azure pillar of wind that shielded its body within, preventing the net of silver flames from closing in on it.In the blink of an eye, the giant ape had already arrived in front of him with a single step. Crackling sounds rang out from its arm as it lashed out at the azure pillar of wind with a single hand.\"Boom!\"A terrifying fist force tore through the air, and the azure wind pillar collapsed in an instant. The miniature centaur let out a mournful scream, and with a \"bang\", it was crushed like an egg.At this time, the golden-furred giant ape was bathed in blood, and most of its body was dyed red. However, it suddenly turned around and pounced toward the one-eyed giant that was lying on the ground not far away.The giant's heart was pierced by the lightning halberd condensed by the centaur, and it was heavily injured. However, its vitality was extremely strong, and it didn't die.At this moment, the bloody hole in its chest was once again blocked by a layer of fine yellow crystal sand. Its aura was still extremely weak, and it seemed to have problems moving.Seeing the golden-furred giant ape pouncing toward it, the giant's face showed extreme fear. It shouted loudly, and a large amount of yellow crystal sand quickly condensed under its body to form a sand boat. It barely lifted its body and flew away. At the same time, the eye on its forehead lit up with white light again.\"Whoosh!\"A white light beam shot out, going straight for the golden-furred giant ape's head.The giant ape that Han Li had transformed into felt a chill in his heart. Although he didn't know what kind of attack this white light was, he knew that it couldn't be touched when he thought about the centaur being hit by it.While thinking, a golden light flashed on his body, and his figure quickly shrank, returning to his human form.The corner of the one-eyed giant's mouth twitched, and a white light flashed in its eye.The white light beam trembled, and actually turned downward like a living thing, continuing to shoot toward Han Li at an astonishing speed.Han Li was greatly shocked. He wanted to dodge to the side, but it was already too late.Just as the beam of light was about to touch him, an idea flashed through his mind. He reached out to pull the Sky Bottle off his neck and tossed it toward the white beam of light.An unexpected scene appeared!As soon as the white light beam came into contact with the Sky Bottle, it directly disappeared into it in a flash. There was no reaction on the surface of the bottle at all.Seeing this, Han Li's mouth opened slightly, and he revealed an expression of surprise. He waved his hand to retrieve the bottle, and continued to rush toward the one-eyed giant without looking at it carefully.At this moment, the giant's only eye was wide open, and he couldn't believe what he was seeing. However, he immediately came back to his senses and urged the remaining magic power in his body, causing the Yellow Crystal Sand Boat beneath him to shine brightly with a yellow light. Its speed greatly increased as it flew into the distance.In the end, Han Li transformed into a golden-furred giant ape halfway through, and suddenly opened his mouth.Roar!An earth-shattering roar erupted from his mouth!Suddenly, a white misty wave surged out. Wherever it passed, the void was distorted, and it instantly enveloped the area of a few hundred feet in front of it.The sound wave was so far away, so it naturally couldn't cause much damage to the thick skin of the one-eyed giant. However, it caused the sand boat beneath him to shatter with a loud bang.The huge body of the one-eyed giant suddenly became unstable, and it fell from the sky rapidly.At this moment, a golden light flashed below, and the golden-furred giant ape flew over. He suddenly punched upwards, and it hit the giant's head directly.\"Peng!\"The giant's head burst open, and a large amount of red and white matter splattered everywhere.Whoosh!A somewhat dim yellow light shot out from his body. It was the one-eyed giant's Nascent Soul.As a result, as soon as it appeared, a silver light flashed above it, and a silver fire net came down from above. Then, it suddenly contracted, and it was wrapped in it.Countless silver runes flew out from it and attached to the Nascent Soul, forming a silver seal in the blink of an eye. It couldn't move at all, and it was suspended in the air.All these actions were like lightning. Before the one-eyed giant's Nascent Soul had time to use any means, it was trapped.It didn't expect that Han Li had learned a lesson from the previous mistake, so he released the essence fire bird in advance, waiting for it to fall into the trap.\"Peng!\"The giant's body fell heavily to the ground. As a result, after the spirit patterns on its body dimmed, its huge body turned into an air-dried rock. With a crisp \"ka ka\" sound, it turned into countless tiny yellow crystal sand.However, the gray eye remained, and it rolled a few times on the ground.Not far away, a green figure floated down. It was Han Li who had returned to his human form.At this moment, he was looking down at the green bottle in his hand. His eyes flickered as if he was thinking about something.But after a while, he raised his head and waved his hand in front of him. The gray eye steadily fell into his hand under a suction force.This eyeball now looked like an ordinary stone bead. It didn't emit the slightest aura, but since it could emit the light with a trace of the law of time, it was obviously not an ordinary item.Han Li's heart stirred, and for some reason, he gently touched the Heavenly Vase with his lone eye.\"Dang\", there was a crisp sound.As a result, whether it was the eye or the Sky Bottle, there was no change at all.Seeing this situation, he shook his head and smiled. He didn't think much about it. After hanging the green bottle on his neck again, he took out a green jade box and carefully put the eye in it.At this time, the silver flame that sealed the giant's Nascent Soul flew in front of him with full spirituality.Han Li looked up at the giant's Nascent Soul with a trace of hesitation on his face.He wasn't sure what this monster's Nascent Soul, whose cultivation was far beyond the Mahayana stage and comparable to a Perfected Immortal, could be used for, but one thing was for sure. This thing should be rare even in the Celestial Realm.However, he didn't have time to think about this now. With a shake of his sleeve, he stuck several talismans on the giant's Nascent Soul. Only then did he recall the Essence Fire Bird and put the Nascent Soul into a wooden box.After that, he walked towards the centaur's corpse a few hundred meters away and threw it into his storage bracelet like he did before.After doing all this, he let out a long breath.This intense battle had truly caused him to be quite exhausted. Fortunately, it was more daunting than dangerous, and most of the injuries he'd suffered were superficial wounds that weren't serious.He raised his eyes and looked around, and he noticed that after this battle, this small island was already in a state of desolation. Countless ancient trees were broken, and the ground was filled with holes and holes.Only some places further away, which were not affected by the battle, managed to maintain some of their original appearance.Han Li closed his eyes slightly and released his Divine Sense. In an instant, the entire land was shrouded in it.After a while, he raised his eyebrows slightly, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the dense forest, the ancient trees were quiet and lush.Han Li traversed through the forest, and even with his current wealth of knowledge and experience, he was struck by a sense of dizziness.There were many exotic flowers and rare herbs growing everywhere he looked. Some of them were even the best spiritual materials that were rare in the Spiritual Realm in a hundred years. Now, they could be seen everywhere, and most of them were not young. Most of them were more than a thousand years old, and there were even a few that were more than ten thousand years old.In addition, there were some spiritual plants. Although he did not recognize them, most of them contained amazing spiritual power or had a strange smell, so he naturally collected them all without hesitation.Even though he'd roughly swept through this mysterious bubble space with his Divine Sense when he'd just stepped into it, he still exclaimed endlessly with admiration in his heart when he saw it with his own two eyes now, and he rejoiced in his heart that he didn't just leave like that.About half an hour later, Han Li's figure stopped in a relatively open area in the forest. The trees here were sparse, and there were no spiritual herbs growing. It seemed a little barren.More than a thousand meters in front of him was a huge cave with a width of more than a thousand meters. It was like a giant sack with a black mouth facing him.After Han Li stood still, he looked around a little. After confirming that there was nothing unusual, he walked to the cave and looked inside.This cave was not vertical, but it extended diagonally to the ground. There was a constant \"wu wu\" sound of wind coming from inside.A blue light flashed in Han Li's eyes. He strode into the cave.The cave was dim and a little damp. There was the sound of water dripping on the top of the cave and the rock walls on both sides. The ground was also very soft when stepped on.He walked all the way down, and after walking for about a quarter of an hour, the path of the cave suddenly changed and extended to the other side. Moreover, among the rocks around the cave walls, pieces of white crystals that emitted a cold light began to appear.At first, they were a little sparse, but the deeper he went, the denser the crystals became. Gradually, the entire passage was illuminated.After walking for another quarter of an hour, he finally came to the end of the cave. It was a huge underground culvert with a radius of thousands of meters.The ceiling of the culvert was densely embedded with countless white crystals. The cold light emitted from the crystals filled the entire cavern.At the bottom, the clear sound of flowing water could be heard. There was actually an underground river flowing through, forming a small lake here. Around the lake was a sandy land made of yellow crystal sand.The white luster and the rippling surface of the water reflected each other, reflecting the clear and crystalline light around the cave walls. It actually looked a bit strangely beautiful.However, Han Li was not in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery. His eyes were firmly locked on the center of the culvert, where a huge rock protruded out of the water.On that piece of land that was about three hundred feet in size grew a strange tree that was about a hundred feet tall.The trunk of the tree was somewhat similar to a common walnut tree in the secular world, but it was completely bare, without a single leaf growing on it. Only walnut-like fruits hung on the branches.Han Li leaped and landed under the tree. He carefully looked up and down at the tree.Upon closer inspection, he discovered that there were mysterious patterns on the tree that he had never seen before. They didn't seem to be carved by someone, but seemed to have grown naturally.The walnut fruits hanging on the tree were even more peculiar. The patterns on the surface were dense, but they were extremely distorted. They looked like strange human faces. Some looked like old people, some looked like newborn babies, and some looked like middle-aged women. They were not exactly the same.However, no matter what the patterns on them were, these human-faced walnut fruits all emitted an astonishing earth-attributed yuan qi.He had been attracted here because he had discovered this wave of Yuan Qi.Han Li rubbed his chin, a thoughtful look flashing across his face. He had a vague guess in his heart.This mysterious bubble space should have belonged to the one-eyed giant, and the centaur beast had fought to the death for this strange walnut tree in the space.Although he couldn't recognize the origin of the tree and the walnut fruits on it, there was one thing he was sure of. Something that could cause two monsters with cultivation comparable to True Immortals to fight over it was definitely not ordinary. It should be some kind of unknown spiritual treasure.However, this was no longer important. Everything here now belonged to him alone.\u2026The Immortal World.In the sky above an unknown mountain range, leaden clouds covered the sky. The wind was howling, and snow kept falling from the sky. The whole sky was gray.There were dozens of peaks on the mountain range. Below the mountainside, there were some scattered trees bent by the thick layer of snow. Above the mountains, it was completely white and frozen.Between heaven and earth, apart from the howling of the chilly wind, there was only the sound of snowflakes falling to the ground. There was no other movement, nor any trace of living beings.However, at this moment, deep in the belly of the tallest ice peak in the mountain range, a shrill female voice suddenly came through the layers of snow, unaffected by the strong wind.\"Who is it?Who was so bold as to kill my spiritual pet?!No matter who it is, I will find you and tear you to pieces. Then, I will extract your soul and suppress it under my Heavy Yin Peak. You will never be reincarnated! \"His voice was filled with anger, and it reverberated through the violent snowstorm, causing the entire snowy peak to tremble.Countless huge chunks of snow that had accumulated for countless years broke apart and slid down the cliff. They pushed and carried even more snow as they rushed down the mountain in a mighty manner. Rumbling sounds that sounded like the beating of war drums rang out.\u2026In a blue sea in the Northern Frost Celestial Realm.A bright sun was hanging in the sky, like a clear sky that had been washed by water. There were thin white clouds floating in the sky, and a breeze was blowing over the sea, making small waves.On the rippling blue sea, there was a black island with a circumference of several thousand miles. Its edges were surrounded by countless strange-shaped black reefs. It looked extremely irregular, and if one looked down from the sky, it would look like an incomparably huge leaf.At the north of the island, there were many ships anchored at the moment, but it was empty, without a single person on it.From the port to the island, there was a spacious bluestone road, which extended into the dense forest on the island.At the end of the road, there was a simple village with densely packed buildings, hidden among the towering ancient trees.At this moment, fire was everywhere in the village, thick smoke billowed everywhere, and a series of earth-shaking battle cries came from everywhere. The light of magic treasures rose one after another, and the air was also filled with a thick smell of blood.In a mess of ruins, nearly a thousand cultivators were fighting, vaguely divided into two camps, the number of people on both sides seemed to be similar.One of the cultivators didn't seem to be human. They were all tall, green-skinned, and fanged, most of them holding some magic weapons like hammers, and the surface of their bodies was covered with a layer of light white light.Among these foreign cultivators, there were also some tall and sturdy warriors wearing yellow armor and wielding wolf-tooth clubs. However, their entire bodies were waxy yellow, and they didn't look like living people. Instead, they looked more like moving wax statues.The cultivators on the other side were mostly human, and there were some strange soldiers wearing blood-red armor.These blood-armored soldiers had the same skin color as their armor, and their faces were dull. They didn't have the slightest expression when they were fighting, and they looked like puppets.On a high ground, a blood-armored soldier holding a blood-red spear leaped down. He raised the spear in his hand and stabbed it at a waxen soldier who was running forward.Before it fell, a blood-colored vortex suddenly burst at the tip of the blood spear, and countless blood rays swept down.\"Boom\".\"The waxy yellow soldier's chest was blown up, and yellow wax juice kept flowing out of it. He couldn't help but take a few steps back.However, in the next moment, he arched his legs and leaped into the air like a bolt of lightning. He swung the mace in his hand abruptly, and countless mace projections appeared, transforming into a yellow hurricane that swept toward the crimson-armored soldiers who had just landed on the ground.\"Peng!\"\"The blood-armored soldier was caught off guard, and his head suddenly burst open. But at the last moment, he threw the spear in his hand, and it turned into a blood shadow, and directly pierced the waxy yellow soldier's head.Both of them fell to the ground almost at the same time. One turned into a pool of blood, and the other turned into a ball of wax juice.On the other side, the figure of a short and fat old man suddenly flashed out from behind a broken wall, holding a blood-red jade bottle in his hand. The mouth of the bottle was turned upside down, and it pointed straight at a foreign race cultivator who was chasing after someone a hundred feet away.The old man patted the bottom of the bottle with his palm, and a blood light flashed at the mouth of the bottle. Then, a dense blood shot out of the bottle, and intertwined into a blood-red light beam, silently shooting straight at the back of the foreign race cultivator.A strange scene appeared!As soon as the blood-red light beam touched the layer of white light on the surface of the foreign race's body, its momentum suddenly slowed down. Although it wasn't completely offset, its power seemed to be instantly reduced by 30%.\"Peng!\"Although the foreign race cultivator was hit and blood spurted from his mouth, it didn't hurt his foundation. Instead, it turned around and rushed toward the old man with a roar.Similar scenes were playing out everywhere in the village from time to time.Regardless of whether it was the waxen warriors or the blood-armored soldiers, they were unusually brave and fierce when they fought. They were valiant and didn't fear death. However, because their numbers were similar, and their strength was also similar, they naturally couldn't control the situation of the battle.However, the foreign race cultivators were protected by the strange white light, so any magic treasures or spells that fell on their bodies would be weakened by 30%. Therefore, they quickly gained the upper hand on the battlefield, and forced the human cultivators to retreat, gathering at the center of the village.Meanwhile, on a white stone plaza at the center of the village, dozens of black-robed people were sitting cross-legged around a huge statue, and they were silently chanting a strange incantation.These people were men and women, old and young, and their complexions were somewhat pale. Each of them had their sleeves rolled up, and their left arms stretched out in front of them.On each of their wrists, there was a thin line of blood, and a drop of dark red blood was flowing from it, dripping on the ground in front of them.On the ground, there were grooves that were half a finger deep, and they intertwined with each other to form a rather complicated formation pattern, which led to the statue in the center.The statue was about 100 feet high, and it was carved in the image of a Young Confucian scholar. The scholar wore a silk scarf on his head, and held a scroll in his hand. He raised his eyes and looked into the distance.If Han Li were here, he would be surprised to find that the Young Confucian scholar's facial features were somewhat similar to his own. However, if one looked at the proportion of their physiques, Han Li was obviously taller.In front of the statue, there was a white-haired old man dressed in a grey robe. He crossed his hands over his shoulders, and prayed to the statue with a pious expression on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe ditch on the ground around the statue of the Youth Confucian scholar had long been filled with blood. All the blood was like a trickle, gathering under the statue.Following the white-haired old man's slightly trembling voice, a layer of faint bloody light on the surface of the statue fluctuated rhythmically. A bloody vortex was spinning incessantly at the front of the robe, emitting bursts of strange fluctuations.\"Buzz!\" A strange sound was heard!The bloody vortex lit up, and a soldier in bloody armor flashed out of it. His dull eyes swept outside for a moment, and his figure soared into the sky, flying straight in the direction of the battlefield outside the square.After a while, the bloody vortex flashed again, and another soldier in bloody armor flashed out of it, joining the battle outside the periphery.At this moment, a black-robed girl sitting cross-legged around the statue suddenly tilted and fell down.Her face was as pale as paper, and even her lips were devoid of blood. The wound on her wrist was still open, but not a single drop of blood could flow out.Seeing this, the white-haired old man showed a trace of pity in his eyes, but he could only wave his hand.Among the dozen or so people who were waiting on the side, a large man in linen clothes immediately stepped forward and carried the girl to the side. He took out a red pill and fed it to her.The position that the little girl had vacated was quickly filled by a young girl.The girl's face was a little timid, but she still sat cross-legged without the slightest delay. Like the others, she rolled up the sleeve of her left arm, took out a shining knife, and put it on her wrist.She closed her eyes in fear, bit her lips, and slit the knife across her wrist.A striking line of blood immediately emerged, and the dark red blood fell like a string of bloody pearls.\u2026Although the altar here was operating at full capacity, and there would be bloody armor soldiers emerging from it to join the battle every once in a while, it couldn't stop the decline of the human side.It didn't take long for the fierce battle cries to become closer and closer. The faces of the people in the square also became abnormally ugly, and their eyes gradually revealed a look of despair.The altar formation on the square with the statue of the Youth Confucian scholar at the center was the foundation of their race's inheritance. If it was attacked by the foreign races, and the statue was destroyed, then the entire race would be wiped out.At this moment, more and more human cultivators were being forced to retreat to the periphery of the square, forming a defensive ring, and putting up a final fight.In the air above, a series of loud booms rang out, and several balls of light violently collided, revealing over a dozen figures.Six of them were green-skinned foreign beings, and all of them had sinister expressions. Their eyes were filled with a fanatical desire for battle, and their protruding fangs were flashing with cold light.The green-skinned foreign beings were quite tall, and their leader was a purple-robed man who was at least two heads taller than his brethren, making him look like an iron tower standing in mid-air.His aura was extremely powerful, indicating that he was a Grand Ascension Stage cultivator, and the five beings behind him were all at the late-Body Integration Stage.All of the five human cultivators were at the early-Body Integration Stage, and the five foreign beings behind him were all at the mid-Body Integration Stage.Among the five human cultivators facing off against them, there was a slightly portly man in a set of azure robes who was at the late-Body Integration Stage, while the others were only at the early-Body Integration Stage, so they were clearly no match for these foreign beings.With their entire race on the brink of extinction, the green-robed man couldn't help but grit his teeth as he glanced at the massive statue on the square.However, right at this moment, a sudden turn of events unfolded!A ball of bright white light appeared in front of the green-robed man and the others without any warning, exploding violently like a scorching sun. Countless rays of light shot forth from within, instantly engulfing all of them.Boom boom boom!An extremely powerful shockwave surged forth from the center of the explosion, instantly forming several violent tornadoes that swept forth in all directions.Several blurry figures suddenly shot forth from the white light before plummeting toward the square.\"Boom!\" A loud sound rang out.The ground at the edge of the square crumbled, instantly forming a large pit that was over 100 feet deep.However, very soon, several streaks of light flew out from the pit, revealing the figures of the human cultivators. At this moment, their clothes were all in tatters, and their auras were in a mess.The green-robed man's face was as pale as a sheet of paper, and he was holding a broken shield with blood patterns in his hand. Blood was constantly flowing from the corner of his mouth.Just now, he had done his best to protect everyone. Although none of them had lost their lives, he had clearly paid a heavy price.\"Leader \u2026\"When the surrounding humans saw this, they were even more alarmed, and all of them began to cry out.The green-robed man wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his sleeve, then waved at everyone to indicate that he was fine.He looked up at the sky, and seeing that the foreign beings didn't immediately chase after him, he took a few steps toward the statue and cast an inquiring glance at the white-haired old man.The old man shook his head and said with a sorrowful expression, \"There's still no response from the Ancestral God.\"The green-robed man laughed bitterly and murmured, \"Lord Ancestral God, are you really going to abandon your people and your servants?\"At this moment, the purple-robed foreign being had already flown into the sky above the square with a few elders.He laughed and said, \"Hahaha \u2026 Luo Feng, are you still begging your useless Ancestral God?Why don't you change your mind and worship our Ancestral God instead? \"\"Tuha, don't be so insolent!Your Ancestral God was only defeated by our Ancestral God back then, \"the green-robed man rebuked angrily.\"Hehe, what's a momentary humiliation back then?As the saying goes, the winner takes all. Our Ancestral God is still protecting our race and has never failed. But what about yours?Ever since he was heavily injured and fell into a deep slumber 10,000 years ago, has he ever woken up?I'm afraid he's already dead, right? \"The purple-robed foreign being, Tuha, pointed at the white light on his body, then looked at the statue, and said disdainfully.Luo Feng was stunned when he heard that. He wanted to retort, but he was speechless. This was because there was nothing wrong with what the green-robed foreign being said.In the past 10,000 years, the Ancestral God of their race had always been in a deep slumber. He had almost no contact with his people. Especially in the past 1,000 years, he had not responded to the calls of his people.When the great enemy invaded this time, they had already braced themselves and used the blood essence of their people to try and awaken the Ancestral God. However, there was no response until now.Although they could still summon some Ancestral Guards through this statue left behind by the Ancestral God, it was like trying to put out a burning cart of firewood with a cup of water. They could only barely resist the enemy and could not change the overall situation at all.\"Luo Feng, you're dreaming if you think you can stop our Tuhun Race with just these blood-armored Dao soldiers that you summoned.If you don't surrender obediently, I'll slaughter your entire race, \"Tuha suddenly raised his voice and shouted fiercely.As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and the surrounding Icy Crystal Race swarmed forward. Their attacks instantly became more ferocious.Wu Meng Island was already at a disadvantage. Now, they were in an even more precarious situation. Many of their defensive lines had been breached, and the enemy was about to reach the center of the square.Luo Feng's body trembled, and his expression was extremely unsightly. He felt a little despair in his heart.At this moment, a low humming sound suddenly came from somewhere. The green statue suddenly trembled and let out a rumbling sound.Soon after, the statue released an extremely dazzling black light that grew brighter and brighter.\"This is \u2026 the Ancestral God \u2026 the Ancestral God has manifested!\"The white-haired old man who was closest to the altar was the first to notice the change. He shouted in joy.The people of Wu Meng Island were stunned at first. Then, when they heard the old man's voice, they immediately revealed expressions of joy. Their morale soared, and their defensive line that was on the verge of collapse showed signs of stabilizing.The attacking Icy Crystal Race's expressions were the opposite. They also became very nervous.If the enemy's Ancestral God could truly manifest, even their Great Ascension Stage Patriarch would not be a match for it.\"Impossible!\"Patriarch Tuha exclaimed in disbelief as he stared at the statue below.The light released by the statue grew brighter and brighter. Then, with a sudden flash, the entire statue suddenly exploded, turning into a large expanse of pitch-black light.After the black light flashed a few times, it turned into a black vortex with a radius of several hundred feet.Pitch-black arcs of lightning flashed within the vortex. They tore through the void and let out a deafening sound of thunder.As the black vortex appeared, dark clouds appeared in the originally bright sky. There were also bolts of lightning flashing within the clouds.The Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi within a radius of several hundred miles started to churn violently like boiling water.Seeing this, the expressions of both sides changed greatly. They immediately stopped their attacks in fear.The number of black arcs of lightning in the vortex increased rapidly. Then, they gathered at one point and turned into a huge black ball of lightning. It sizzled.Pfft!The black ball of lightning suddenly twisted. Then, it elongated and turned into a pitch-black spatial fissure that was several hundred feet long.Whoosh!A figure flew out of the spatial fissure. He swayed slightly before stabilizing himself in mid-air. It was the figure of an azure-robed man.The spatial fissure flashed wildly a few times before slowly closing and disappearing.In the next moment, the black vortex in mid-air also slowly dissipated. The surging Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi quickly returned to normal. The dark clouds in the sky also disappeared.Although the azure-robed man looked a little disheveled, there was a hint of joy on his face.However, when he stabilized himself and looked around, he frowned slightly when he saw the dense crowd around him.This person was Han Li. He had used all his strength and finally succeeded in passing through the interface gap.However, at this moment, his magic power was almost depleted. His physical strength was also greatly depleted. The Eight Treasures Exquisite Bone Armor had also completely collapsed in the spatial storm.However, what was going on in front of him?\"Lord Ancestral God!You're finally back! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Ancestor God!Lord Ancestor God! \"The people of Wu Meng Island, especially the younger ones, immediately cried out in joy when they saw the clan leader's actions. They retreated a distance and bowed to Han Li.However, the older clansmen and the elders had strange expressions on their faces. They seemed to be a little hesitant.Luo Feng glared at the elders and shouted, \"What are you standing there for? Hurry up and pay your respects to the Ancestor God!\"\"Greetings \u2026 greetings Ancestor God!\" Those people trembled and hurriedly bowed to Han Li.\"Ancestor God?\"Han Li's expression didn't change, but he was inwardly startled.After the initial confusion, with his experience and knowledge, he naturally understood the current situation immediately. The human side led by the slightly plump and elegant man was clearly being besieged by the foreign race led by the burly man in a purple robe, and the situation was quite bad. It could even be said that they were only a step away from defeat.He didn't expect to encounter such a situation when he had finally returned to the Immortal World. If it wasn't for the fact that there was only one Great Ascension cultivator here and that there didn't seem to be any higher-level beings that could threaten him within a thousand miles, he would have left without a word.After all, no matter how badly they fought here, it had nothing to do with him.In the air not far away, Tu Ha looked at the sudden appearance of Han Li with a gloomy expression.They were just one step away from annihilating the humans on Wu Meng Island. However, at the last moment, an unforeseen event occurred.A Body Integration cultivator with a mustache walked over to Tu Ha and transmitted his voice, \"Clan leader, what should we do now? Should we go back and ask for instructions \u2026\"Tu Ha hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and transmitted his voice, \"We've finally forced these damned humans to this extent. We can't give up halfway. Pass down my orders. Fight to the bitter end!\"\"But if this person is really the Ancestor God of Wu Meng Island, I'm afraid \u2026\" The mustached man said worriedly.\"Hmph!This person's appearance is very strange. He looks very young, but it's hard to say whether he is the Ancestor God of Wu Meng Island.Furthermore, his aura is very weak, and he must be heavily injured. There's nothing to fear.Let's attack together. As long as we kill him on the spot, Wu Meng Island will be finished! \"Tu Ha's eyes flashed coldly as he transmitted his voice.As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly shot out and appeared in the sky above Han Li like a bolt of lightning. He looked at Han Li coldly.The mustached man and the other three Body Integration Stage beings immediately followed suit, forming an encirclement around Han Li along with Tu Ha.At this moment, Han Li had his hands clasped behind his back as he looked into Tuha's eyes expressionlessly.Before either side had done anything else, a burst of battle cries erupted from the surrounding Icy Crystal beings as they charged toward the center of the plaza again.The Wu Meng Island cultivators immediately charged into battle. However, due to Han Li's appearance, their morale was quite high.Dragon God!!! \"Dragon Tu Wu Wu sect's Meng Looked Luo God.\" Luo Feng \"Meng\" Feng Luo \"Said.He opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Tu Ha made his move. A large blue light suddenly appeared on his body. It condensed behind him to form a blue python the size of a small mountain. There was a huge curved horn on its head.As soon as the single-horned python was formed, it opened its huge mouth and spat at Han Li.Countless blue ripples appeared and surged toward Han Li.A strange cold power spread out from the blue ripples, and with a loud sizzling sound, ice crystals of different thickness spread out, and the void seemed to be frozen.At the same time, Tu Ha made a grabbing motion with his hands. Immediately, a large patch of blue light spun and transformed into two blue short spears. Along the way, countless blue ice flames appeared on the surface of the spears, and they turned into two blue ice dragons that were over 100 feet long. They pounced toward Han Li from both sides.Almost at the same time Tu Ha made his move, the mustached man and the other three Body Integration cultivators also activated their magic treasures and attacked Han Li.When Han Li saw this, he calmly raised his hand. One of his hands reached out from his sleeve and slapped toward the blue ripples.\"Boom!\"A terrifying invisible force turned into waves of air and collided with the blue ripples.A series of crackling sounds rang out, and the blue ripples were crushed like rotten twigs. They disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye.Right at this moment, a bone-chilling cold hit his face. Two blue ice dragons flew toward him from both sides with their fangs and claws bared.Han Li didn't even bat an eyelid. He waved his other hand, and layers of ripples appeared in the air, as if an invisible giant hand had brushed past.With two bangs, the two ice dragons wailed and shattered inch by inch. They turned back into two blue short spears, and Han Li grabbed them with one hand.When Tu Ha saw this, his face turned pale for a moment. Then, a look of disbelief appeared in his eyes.Rumble!The attacks from the other four Body Integration Stage beings had also struck Han Li's body, but a semi-transparent light barrier appeared over his body, and the silver tubes on the surface of the barrier swirled slightly to repel all of the attacks, thereby allowing him to remain completely unscathed.\"How could this be?!\" The mustached man and the other three Body Integration cultivators' expressions changed drastically, and they immediately sensed that something was amiss.Before the four of them had a chance to react, Han Li waved a hand through the air, and the two blue short spears in his hands shot forth as two streaks of blue light. In a flash, the spears punctured the chests of the mustached man and the other Body Integration cultivator.In the instant that the blue spears struck the two Body Integration cultivators, dazzling white light immediately appeared over their bodies. However, that didn't prevent the blue spears from being punctured in the slightest. Immediately thereafter, the two of them were reduced to mincemeat by the power of the spears. Even their Nascent Souls didn't get a chance to escape before they perished on the spot.Almost in the next instant, two blurry fist projections appeared in front of the remaining two Body Integration cultivators, striking their bodies like lightning.The two of them had no time to react, but a layer of white light immediately appeared over their bodies, forming a light shield in an attempt to keep the fist projections at bay.\"Ka ka\", the light shield was easily shattered, and then the fist shadow hit the bodies of the two people.Two muffled explosions rang out, and the bodies of the two exploded, turning into countless bloody mists.Less than a single breath had passed from the moment Tu Ha and the others had attacked to when Han Li had killed the four Body Integration cultivators.At this moment, Tu Ha had already recovered from his shock. Without saying a word, he turned into a white streak of light and shot into the distance at an astonishing speed.At the same time, the bracelet on one of his wrists flashed in rapid succession, and several layers of light barriers of different colors instantly appeared over his body. His entire body had also been enshrouded in a layer of blue crystalline armor.Right at this moment, Han Li let loose a low harrumph.As a result, Tu Ha, who had already flown several thousand feet away, suddenly felt a sharp stabbing pain in his head, following which he stumbled out of the air and plummeted to the ground.But immediately afterward, a seemingly ordinary jade pendant on his neck shattered with a \"bang\", turning into crystalline green threads that disappeared into his head in a flash.Tu Ha immediately felt a cool sensation in his head, and he immediately returned to his senses.However, his body then swayed, and Han Li took advantage of this opportunity to cover a distance of several thousand feet, arriving right in front of him. Seven balls of blue light flashed from his chest and abdomen, and one of his arms abruptly thickened before clenching into a fist and launching an attack toward Tu Ha.Tu Ha's heart jolted with shock, and he immediately raised a blue saber in front of him to block the attack.\"Thump!\"His tower-like body was immediately sent flying like a broken sack. Not only did the blue saber in his hand shatter inch by inch, but the layers of light barriers on his body also collapsed with a loud bang. Even the surface of the Icy Crystal Armor on his body was densely covered in cracks.Han Li raised his brow, revealing a hint of surprise. However, his body then blurred, and he appeared in front of Tu Ha like a shadow, ruthlessly throwing another punch at his opponent.A terrifying force suddenly arrived, causing the void to ripple.\"Crack!\"The Icy Crystal Armor on Tu Ha's body, along with the layer of solid white light on his body, cracked like an egg. Then, with a \"pfft\" sound, he didn't even have time to let out a cry before his physical body and the Nascent Soul in his body were turned into a pile of flesh and blood.A sparkling blue bracelet flew back, and with a flash, it landed steadily in Han Li's hand.After releasing his divine sense to scan it, he directly threw it into his storage bracelet, and then leisurely looked down below.The dense crowd around the plaza was now completely silent. The Icy Crystal Race and Wu Meng Island were all dumbfounded as they stood where they were, and had already stopped fighting.\"Mighty Ancestral God!Kill! Chase all of these foreign races out of Wu Meng Island! \"Luo Feng was ecstatic, and he was the first to react as he let loose a cheer.\"Mighty Ancestral God!\"The people of Wu Meng Island also came to their senses at this moment, and they let loose deafening cheers as they charged toward the Icy Crystal Race.Although the Icy Crystal Race had slightly more people than the people of Wu Meng Island, their leader and four of the most powerful beings in their race had been killed in an instant. Without a leader, they immediately lost all will to battle, and they were forced into retreat.Han Li naturally had no interest in the pursuit of the remaining Icy Crystal Race beings. His body swayed as he returned to the plaza, and he collected the storage items of the four Body Integration Stage beings.At this moment, on the plaza, aside from those who had yet to return from pursuing their enemies, almost everyone was staring at Han Li. Someone suddenly shouted, \"Welcome, Lord Ancestral God!\"\"Whoosh!\"Everyone knelt to the ground, and their cheers were like a tsunami. Luo Feng also knelt to the ground in an extremely respectful manner.At this moment, the people of Wu Meng Island all wore joyful expressions as if they had just survived a calamity, and there were even many among them who were sobbing uncontrollably.However, most of them were looking at Han Li with reverence and reverence in their eyes, as if they were mortals looking at a god.Han Li swept his gaze across everyone with an extremely calm expression.He didn't immediately announce to everyone that he wasn't the Ancestral God they were talking about, nor did he take advantage of the situation to admit this. Instead, his lips moved slightly as he sent a voice transmission to Luo Feng.Luo Feng's body trembled slightly upon hearing this, and he immediately rose to his feet. With a solemn expression, he issued a few instructions to the people around him.\"Elder Hu, you'll be responsible for treating the injured, as well as taking stock of our losses. Elder Qi, you'll be responsible for guarding the clan in case those foreign races make a comeback... I'm going to follow Lord Ancestral God to the Ancestral God Pavilion, and no one is allowed to approach without my permission.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Lord Ancestral God, this way please.\"Luo Feng bowed slightly and made a \"please\" gesture, leading Han Li to the back of the broken statue. When the surrounding clansmen saw this, they all bowed and opened up a path.The two of them hadn't gone far when the other clansmen on the plaza shouted in unison.\"Farewell, Lord Ancestral God!\"Their voices were abnormally loud and uniform. They repeated this several times until Han Li and Luo Feng's figures gradually disappeared into the forest behind them.During this entire process, Han Li didn't look back, nor did he slow down his footsteps.Following a winding path paved with stone slabs in the forest, the two of them arrived in front of a simple and unadorned hall that was suspended on top of a mountain.This hall was no more than thirty meters tall. Compared to ordinary palaces, it wasn't very tall. The walls were pitch-black and seemed to have been built using materials from the island's reefs. It was covered in mottled traces left behind by the corrosion of time. However, the paint on the doors, windows, and pillars were still very bright. It was obvious that they were regularly cleaned and repainted.The small square in front of the hall and the stone steps under the corridor had been swept clean. Not even a few fallen leaves had fallen.Han Li raised his head and looked at the top of the hall door. He saw a black horizontal board hanging there with three ancient words written in gold paint: \"Ancestral God Pavilion\".Luo Feng quickly walked forward and bowed respectfully. Then, he pushed open the door with a creak and invited Han Li into the pavilion.After entering the hall, Han Li saw a black stone statue that was as tall as a real person. Just by looking at its expression, it did look somewhat similar to him.\"Since there's only the two of us here, I'll be straightforward.I'm not the Ancestral God that you speak of. My appearance here today is just an accident. \"Han Li looked at it for a moment before withdrawing his gaze. He turned to look at the scholarly man behind him and went straight to the point.When Luo Feng heard this, a trace of fear flashed across his face. He hurriedly bowed to the ground and said:\"Lord Ancestral God, if it weren't for your true body descending today, our Wu Meng Island wouldn't have been able to escape the fate of extermination. You must not abandon us!Our entire clan has been devoutly worshipping you for the past ten thousand years. We hope that you will continue to protect us! \"\"If those people hadn't bumped into me today, I wouldn't have made a move. You don't have to be grateful.As the Patriarch, you know very well whether or not I am your Ancestor God. Don't think that I will help you block this disaster. \"Han Li said coldly.Luo Feng's body trembled. At first, he revealed a look of fear. Then, he helplessly smiled bitterly.\"Senior, it doesn't really matter who you are. As long as you agree to stay behind as an Ancestor God and help us overcome this crisis, we'll do everything in our power to provide you with all the cultivation resources you require.\"\"Tell me first. Who exactly is that Universe Enlightened Ancestral God you speak of?\"There was a slight change in Han Li's expression. He did not reply immediately. Instead, he suddenly asked about the Ancestor God.Luo Feng was slightly startled when he heard this, but he still carefully explained, \"The Ancestor God we worship is an ancestor of our clan who became an Immortal hundreds of thousands of years ago. He has been protecting our clan for generations. He is the foundation of our clan's foothold in this place.\"\"In other words, the foreign races that invaded you today also worship an Ancestor God?Could it be that the layer of white light enshrouding their bodies has something to do with the protection provided by their ancestral gods? \"Han Li asked after a brief moment of contemplation.\"That's right. However, their Icy Crystal Race's Ancestor Han Qiu was only an Earth Immortal who had just cultivated to the Great Dao over a hundred thousand years ago. His strength is at the bottom of the Ancestor Gods I know. He was even defeated by our Ancestor God,\" Luo Feng said hatefully.\"What's an Earth Immortal?\" Han Li raised his eyebrows.\"You don't know about Earth Immortals \u2026 Could it be that you just ascended from a lower realm?\" This time, it was Luo Feng's turn to be surprised.Han Li didn't answer. He just looked at Luo Feng calmly.Luo Feng tactfully didn't say anything more. Instead, he explained, \"The so-called Earth Immortals are Immortals who cultivate by absorbing the power of faith from the believers under their protection. Generally speaking, the larger the protected area, the more believers there will be, and the faster their cultivation speed will be, and the stronger their abilities will be.\"\"Tell me about the Icy Crystal Race.\" Han Li nodded thoughtfully and changed the topic.Although he was quite interested in the Ancestor Gods and Earth Immortals, he didn't plan to get to the bottom of it.\"Senior, the Icy Crystal Race is a small race at the edge of the Black Wind Sea, just like our race. The island they reside on is relatively close to our Black Meng Island, and they've always had many conflicts with our race over resources and many other issues.When our clan was at its peak, they naturally didn't dare to act rashly. Now that they see our Ancestor God in a deep sleep, they covet it, \"Luo Feng replied respectfully.After hearing this, Han Li didn't rush to speak again. Instead, he fell into deep thought.Luo Feng naturally didn't dare to say anything more. He just stood at the side with his head lowered.\"What's the distance between the Black Wind Sea and the Northern Frost Celestial Realm?\" Han Li asked after a while.\"This \u2026 as far as I know, the Black Wind Sea is under the jurisdiction of the Northern Frost Celestial Realm, but it's just a remote place.Oh right, this is a partial map of the Black Wind Sea for your reference. \"After a slight hesitation, Luo Feng took out a walnut-sized white bead and handed it to Han Li.Han Li took the bead and closed his eyes. He sent his spirit sense into the bead.A moment later, he slowly opened his eyes. A complicated look flashed across his eyes. After pondering for a long time, he opened his mouth and said,After a while, he said, \"I can protect your Black Meng Island, but I have to say something first.\"\"Senior, please say it.\" Luo Feng was overjoyed and said hurriedly.\"You're right. I just arrived in the Celestial Realm today, and I didn't go through the Immortal Platform.If you have any misgivings about this, I won't hold it against you. Just treat it as if nothing happened. \"Han Li didn't hide anything and said frankly.\"Of course not!I'm already very grateful that Senior can tell me the truth. \"Luo Feng waved his hand and said.\"Since that's the case, you can call me Ancestor God in front of people in the future to calm them down.But in private, you can call me Senior Liu.If the Cold Crystal Race dares to invade again, I'll take action. Don't forget what you promised, \"Han Li said indifferently.Luo Feng was overjoyed and said, \"Of course, of course \u2026\"\"Alright, arrange a quiet place for me to stay. I need to rest,\" Han Li nodded and said.\"Senior Liu, please come with me.\"Luo Feng immediately led Han Li through the inner hall of the Ancestor God Pavilion and toward the backyard.After leaving the backyard, the two passed through a bamboo forest shrouded in purple mist and arrived in front of a small courtyard with white walls and black tiles.\"This courtyard is where I went into seclusion when I reached a bottleneck in my cultivation.No one will come to disturb you, so you can stay here without worry, Senior, \"Luo Feng said.Han Li looked at the courtyard in front of him and nodded. He walked into the courtyard first.\u2026 \u2026About half a day later.In a deep blue sea tens of thousands of miles away from Black Meng Island, there was a white island that was hundreds of meters tall.Its area was about the same as Black Meng Island, but the island was very long and narrow. It looked like a slender willow leaf. The island's vegetation was sparse, and there were exposed greyish-white rocks everywhere on the island, reflecting the sunlight.On the island, white domed buildings were densely distributed according to the terrain of the island. The higher one went up the mountain, the fewer buildings there were, and the more sparsely they were distributed.When they reached the highest point of the island, there were almost no buildings. There was only a shuttle-shaped plaza that was hundreds of meters long built along the ridge of the mountain.The ground of the plaza was engraved with arc-shaped or ring-shaped veined patterns. They were connected to each other, forming an extremely exquisite and complicated pattern formation.At the center of the formation stood a greyish-white statue that was more than 100 meters tall. It was burly and wore armor that was carved with exquisite patterns. Its face was also covered by a hollowed-out mask. Two curved fangs extended from the sides of the mask, and its slightly curled long hair draped over its back. It looked exceptionally handsome.At this moment, there was a circle of Blue Crystal people kneeling on the ground around the statue. All of them had their heads lowered and their arms crossed. They were silently chanting, carrying out some kind of ritual.After a while, two balls of blue light suddenly shone under the mask of the greyish-white statue. Immediately after, a buzzing voice came from it.\"How did it go \u2026 Eh? Why don't I see Tuha?\"A somewhat bloated Blue Crystal elder stepped forward with a sorrowful expression. He cupped his hands and said, \"Reporting to Lord Ancestral God, previously \u2026\"After a while, he lifted his sleeve to wipe the sweat on his forehead and said, \"That's roughly what happened. Patriarch Tuha and a few elders have already died in battle.Lord Ancestral God, you must seek justice for us. \"After a moment of silence, buzzing voices came from the greyish-white statue again.\"You said that Roman's true body has descended \u2026 That's absolutely impossible!If he had really recovered from his serious injuries 10,000 years ago, given his temperament, he definitely wouldn't have let you guys escape and come back.Moreover, according to your description, that person didn't even release his protective power. \"The Blue Crystal elder asked carefully, \"Lord Ancestral God, since that's the case, do you need us to regroup our forces and attack Wu Meng Island again?\"\"There's no need. Although that person isn't Roman, he can easily kill Tuha and the others. Naturally, he's not someone to be trifled with. If you guys attack again, won't you be courting death?Withdraw first. I have my own arrangements for the rest. \"The blue light on the statue flickered, and the buzzing voices came again.\"Understood.\" The bloated Blue Crystal elder immediately bowed respectfully and retreated with his clansmen.After he left, a voice suddenly came from the statue. It seemed to be muttering to itself.\"Hehe \u2026 Hulu, Hu Tu, Lu Kun, since you guys also have your eyes on the fat piece of meat that is Wu Meng Island and want a piece of it, you naturally have to put in some effort as well.However, that thing can only belong to me alone. After all, whether or not my next advancement will be successful is completely dependent on that thing \u2026. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These were azure formation flags, all of which landed around the courtyard in a flash. Immediately thereafter, a faint azure light barrier appeared, enshrouding the entire courtyard.After doing all this, he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes to regulate his breathing.As time passed, the sky gradually darkened, and stars appeared in the night sky.Han Li opened his eyes and looked up at the starry sky. Then, he took out a medicinal pill and took a deep breath. The Little Big Dipper Star Cultivation Method began to circulate in his body, and seven blue star patterns appeared on his chest and abdomen.As the power of the starlight gathered in the night sky, it formed seven starlight pillars that fell from the sky and entered his body. His pale face slowly recovered.The night passed in the blink of an eye.In the early morning, Han Li opened his eyes and let out a long breath.At this moment, not only was his physical fatigue swept away, but even the damage caused by passing through the interface gap had been completely recovered.After stretching his body, he turned back and walked toward a side room in the courtyard. Not long after, he stood in the room.The space here was not big, only about seven or eight feet. In addition to a green bamboo cabinet and a few sandalwood tables and chairs on both sides, there was only a futon in the center. However, everything was clean and tidy, and it looked spotless.Han Li directly sat cross-legged on the futon, turned his hand, and took out a jade box. After opening it, there was a yellow walnut inside.The patterns on the surface of the walnut vaguely formed a human face, exuding an amazing earth-attribute spiritual energy fluctuation. It was the fruit of the strange walnut tree that he had previously obtained in the mysterious bubble.Previously, because he was in a hurry, he did not carefully examine it. Now, he finally had time to study it.He immediately released his Divine Sense into the walnut, and carefully examined it.As a result, he was shocked by what he saw.The earth-attribute spiritual energy contained in it had reached a shocking level, but it was compressed to the extreme and wrapped in the entire fruit.Because of the Sky Bottle, Han Li had a lot of experience in identifying various spiritual herbs and spiritual materials, especially in judging their age.Although he didn't know what this walnut was, it had to be at least a hundred thousand years old for the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi it contained to reach this level.However, this alone did not seem to be enough for two True Immortal level monsters to fight over it.As Han Li thought so, his Spiritual Sense continued to explore the walnut inch by inch.\"Eh?\"After he had examined it more than ten times, he finally found something strange.The incomparably dense Earth Attribute Spiritual Qi inside the walnut seemed chaotic and disorderly, like a series of undulating and interweaving waves, but there was a vague pattern to it.It seemed that every once in a while, these spiritual energy fluctuations would show a rather strange state of interweaving and fusing, and there would be an extremely faint trace of a special aura emitted from these fluctuations.\"Could this be \u2026\" Han Li's heart thumped a few times.This special aura was somewhat similar to the power of laws, but it wasn't quite the same.He carefully examined it for a while longer, but still couldn't be sure.After a moment's thought, he flipped his hand and took out a wooden box.After opening the box, a small yellow person with a few talismans stuck on its body appeared. It was the owner of the mysterious bubble space, the one-eyed giant's Nascent Soul. One of its eyes was half-closed, and it looked a little sluggish.Han Li grabbed the Nascent Soul with one hand, and a black light appeared on his finger, directly entering it.Soul Search!To find out the secret of the strange human-faced walnut, the fastest way was to directly search its soul.The giant Nascent Soul's originally wooden face showed some signs of struggle, and a layer of yellow light appeared on its body, flickering quickly.Han Li frowned slightly. There seemed to be some kind of strange power inside this Nascent Soul, and it was actually locking down the soul, making it difficult for his Spiritual Sense to penetrate it.He snorted coldly, and the black light in his hand lit up, and he began to gradually increase the intensity of the soul search.The yellow light on the Nascent Soul's body suddenly lit up, and it flickered violently. Its small face revealed a painful expression, but it was suppressed by the talismans, and could not make a sound.Han Li was slightly happy. The power of his Spiritual Sense had finally broken through the layer of strange power on the Nascent Soul, and touched the inside of the soul.But at this moment, his face suddenly changed, and the surface of his skin was suddenly covered by a layer of translucent film.Almost in the next moment, a dazzling yellow light burst out from the Nascent Soul, and then with a \"boom\", it turned into a yellow blazing sun, and submerged Han Li's figure.When the yellow light dissipated, it turned into countless pale yellow flowing lights, and Han Li's figure was once again revealed.At this moment, his body was unscathed, but his face was a little ugly.He did not expect that the power on the one-eyed giant's Nascent Soul would be so overbearing. After being broken through by the power of his Spiritual Sense, it immediately self-detonated, so that he could not find much information about it. He only saw a few fragments of the giant's past, and it seemed that every ten thousand years or so, it would swallow a human-faced walnut, which was very beneficial to its cultivation.Han Li sighed softly, looked at the human-faced walnut for a moment, and turned his hand to put it away.Now it seemed that he could only find another way to find out the origin of this thing. Now that he had just returned to the Immortal World, there were more important things to deal with.After calming down, he stood up and walked out of the small courtyard.\"Greetings, Senior Liu.\" A man in a scholar's robe stood outside the small courtyard, it was Luo Feng.\"Patriarch Luo, why are you here?\" A flash of surprise flashed in Han Li's eyes, and he asked calmly.\"I came to see if Senior is used to living here \u2026 Oh yes, this is some of the cultivation resources that our tribe collected overnight according to Senior's request. Because of the time constraints, only a part of it was collected. The rest will be collected as soon as possible, please forgive me, Senior.\" Luo Feng's face was full of flattery, and he took out a black bracelet, and handed it over with both hands.Han Li reached out to take it, and his Spiritual Sense swept through the bracelet, and he nodded.Seeing this, Luo Feng breathed a sigh of relief.\"You came at the right time. You should have a place like a library here, right? I want to look up some things,\" Han Li said as he put away the bracelet.\"Yes, Senior Liu, please follow me,\" Luo Feng said quickly, and he took the lead to fly into the distance.Han Li's figure soared into the sky, and he followed after him.He looked around and saw that the damage caused by yesterday's battle had been mostly repaired, and the collapsed buildings had begun to be rebuilt.In the empty port in the distance of the island, and in some of the surrounding towns, many mortals without magic power appeared.Yesterday's battle had caused extensive damage, but the towns of the mortals were not affected much.At this moment, the mortals and some cultivators in those towns had gathered together, and they were carrying out a ceremony of worship towards the statues of the Ancestor God on Wumeng Island.\"On the various islands of the Black Sand Sea, there are many mortals living under the protection of the cultivator clans of the various islands. During yesterday's battle, they all hid.Although the cultivators of the various islands are constantly fighting, they usually don't attack mortals, \"Luo Feng noticed Han Li's gaze, and explained.Han Li nodded. The situation here reminded him of the Scattered Star Seas in the past.After a while, the two arrived in front of a double-storey building that occupied a large area.\"Ancestor God!\"\"Patriarch!\"There were a few Void Training Stage cultivators guarding the pavilion. When they saw Luo Feng and Han Li descend, they were shocked, and they hurried over to greet them with an extremely respectful expression.Luo Feng didn't pay attention to them, and directly walked in with Han Li.On the first floor of the library, there were rows of bookshelves that looked orderly, and there were all kinds of books, scrolls, and some jade slips placed on them.Han Li glanced around, and found that the scale of the library here was not big, and it was much smaller than the Sutra Library of the Leng Yan Sect.\"Senior, our clan is weak, and the number of books we have collected is also relatively small. I've made a fool of myself.The first floor mainly contains cultivation methods and unofficial history, and the second floor contains books about magic treasures and pills, \"Luo Feng said with an apologetic expression.\"It's fine, I can stay here by myself. Wu Meng Island has many things waiting to be done, so you can go and do your own things. There's no need to stay here with me,\" Han Li said without a care.\"Yes.\"Luo Feng was startled, and he agreed, turned around, and walked out of the pavilion.Luo Feng's body flashed, and just as he was about to fly away, his eyes flickered, and he stopped. He walked to the side of the library, and waited with his hands down.Han Li slowly browsed through the bookshelves. With his incomparably powerful spiritual sense, the speed at which he looked through the books was naturally extremely fast.The books collected on Wu Meng Island were quite messy, and there were all kinds of books. The books on the first floor were not much different from what Luo Feng had said, and they were all about the Black Wind Sea Region. There were also some books about cultivation below the Great Ascension Stage.What Han Li wanted to investigate was information about Earth Immortals, but unfortunately, there was very little information about Immortals here.However, his hard work paid off. After he had almost flipped through the entire first floor, he finally found a few old jade slips, which had some introductions about Earth Immortals.After half an hour, Han Li put down the last jade slip and opened his eyes.Although there wasn't much content in these jade slips, they finally gave him a relatively clear understanding of Earth Immortals and Ancestral Gods.The so-called Earth Immortals, as Luo Feng had said before, were also one of the numerous Immortals in the Immortal World, but their cultivation method was a bit special.According to the books, Earth Immortals could rely on the faith of their believers to condense the power of laws.However, this method of relying on external force to condense the power of laws had a huge limitation, and that was, Earth Immortals could only use the power of laws in the area where their faith belonged. Once they left this area, the power of laws condensed would almost completely lose its effect.Because of the need to condense the Power of Faith, every Earthly Immortal would have a statue made of special materials to store and refine the Power of Faith, forming an Earthly Incarnation that was unique to the Earthly Immortal. The power of the Power of Law used by this incarnation was even stronger than that of the original body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Earth Immortal \u2026 Power of Law \u2026\"Han Li's eyes flickered as he murmured to himself.Even if he was restricted by the territory after becoming an Earth Immortal, he was still excited to be able to use the Power of Faith to master the Law.When he was in the Spirit Realm, he had seen the Power of Law more than once, especially when he used a Profound Heavenly Treasure like the Profound Heavenly Spirit-Slayer Sword that contained the Power of Law of Heaven and Earth. He had personally felt the power of this power. It was an existence that ordinary cultivation methods, secret techniques, and even spirit treasures could not match.But comparatively speaking, comprehending the energy of the Laws was a great fortuitous encounter that could only be chanced upon by luck. Even if one possessed a treasure that contained the energy of the Laws to comprehend, one might not really be able to accomplish anything in one's entire lifetime. If one was able to grasp the energy of the Laws by becoming an Earthly Immortal, then it could be considered as a feasible method.All signs indicated that the Ancestral God of Wu Meng Island had most likely died. If he wanted to replace him and become the Earth Immortal here, it should not be too big of a problem.Suddenly, he waved his hand.The shadow under him fluctuated slightly, and a black shadow diffused out from it, transforming into the figure of a Youth. It was Magic Light.\"This is \u2026 Friend Han, congratulations on finally returning to the Realm of True Immortals.However, the heaven and earth origin energy here is quite thin. Could it be that you ascended to an extremely remote place? \"After Demonshine appeared, he coldly swept his eyes around and then congratulated Lin Ming with a stiff expression.\"Yes, we are now in the Blackwind Sea, an extremely remote place in the Northern Frost Celestial Realm,\" Han Li said calmly.\"Blackwind Sea \u2026 I seem to have heard of this name before, but I don't have a deep impression of it. It seems that it is indeed a remote place.But it's not bad to be able to come here. At least I don't have to worry about my identity being exposed and being discovered by the enemies of the Immortal Realm, \"Magic Light said emotionlessly.\"It's just an expedient measure,\" Han Li said with a wry smile.The remoteness of this place was indeed one of the reasons why he decided to temporarily stay.\"This time, Friend Han, why did you call me out?\" Magic Light stared at Han Li and asked.\"About the Earth Immortal, how much does Fellow Magic Light know about it?\" Han Li asked directly.\"Earth Immortal?I know a little about it. This kind of Immortal can condense the Power of Law through the power of Faith and is extremely rare in the Immortal Realm. Why does Friend Han ask about this? \"\"Extremely rare?Could it be that Earth Immortals have some other weakness besides being limited by the region they are in? \"Han Li didn't answer Demonshine's question, instead asking a question of his own.\"Although Earth Immortals can use the power of faith to condense nomological laws, there are many limitations to this method. Apart from not being able to leave the area they belong to, because their bodies are mixed with the power of faith, the magic power of an Earth Immortal is far purer than that of an Immortal of the same level.Li of Will will will waste, and, and the condense, the Power of the Power of Imals of the Power of Ims, and it will will will will take a long., so the Of of Of Earth of Imals.\"In that case, there are indeed many restrictions \u2026\" Han Li said thoughtfully.There were many Earth Immortals in the Blackwind Sea, but this was probably related to the special geographical environment of the Blackwind Sea.He learned from the ancient books that the entire Blackwind Sea was blocked by the huge Desolate Black Wind. This sea was almost completely isolated from the outside world. Very few Immortals from the outside world could enter this place. The only way to go to the outside world was through a teleportation array on the island in the center of the Blackwind Sea.Such a special environment caused the Blackwind Sea to have many cultivator families and mortals. Therefore, Earth Immortals and Ancestral Gods, embryonic Earth Immortals, were common here.\"Even among the Itinerant Immortals, there are very few who are willing to become Earth Immortals.\" Magic Light suddenly interrupted.\"Itinerant Immortals?What is that? Are they also a kind of Immortal? \"Han Li was startled and asked.\"People in the Lower Realm generally think that those in the Immortal Realm are True Immortals. But in fact, in the Realm of True Immortals, those who can be called True Immortals are those who have mastered the Power of Law. Those who have not mastered the Power of Law are usually called Itinerant Immortals.There are a lot of Itinerant Immortals. This is the reason why there are nine Immortals out of ten.Because Itinerant Immortals can't understand the Power of Law, they can only rely on cultivating Immortal Spiritual Force to advance. But because they don't have the Power of Law to protect their bodies, it is naturally much more difficult for Itinerant Immortals to pass the Heavenly Tribulation and advance. Naturally, it is much more difficult than True Immortals. \"Magic Light said without any emotion.\"Itinerant Immortals, True Immortals \u2026\" Han Li murmured when he heard this.\"Speaking of which, the Profound Immortal Path that you are walking on now is the so-called Strength Immortal. It is actually a kind of Itinerant Immortal.Profound Immortals don't seek to master the Power of Law. Instead, they mainly focus their cultivation on their bodies. They believe in using strength to break through the Dao and advance. They are considered a different kind of Itinerant Immortals. There are very few of them, even fewer than Earth Immortals. \"Magic Light continued.\"I see. Thank you, Daoist Magic Light, for explaining.\" Han Li nodded slowly.\"Although I'm only left with an incomplete Divine Soul, I still remember most of the things in the Immortal World. If you have any doubts in the future, feel free to ask me.\"Magic Light's figure flickered. Without waiting for Han Li to say anything, he once again integrated into Han Li's shadow.Han Li stood in the same place with his eyes slightly narrowed, digesting what he had just heard.After a while, he let out a sigh of relief and walked toward the second floor of the Sutra Depository \u2026\"Mortal Immortal Artifacts carry the Power of Law of Heaven and Earth. They have unpredictable abilities. If there is a difference in the Law, then their cultivation will be different. They can break through all things, establish new life, and remember the past \u2026\"Han Li silently read the small golden words on an ancient book in his heart. He couldn't help but think of the Profound Sky Ruyi Blade and the Profound Sky Spiritslayer Sword, the two Profound Sky Treasures that he had used in the Spiritual Realm.The Profound Sky Spiritslayer Sword, as the top 3 treasures on the Chaotic Myriad Spirit List, had a powerful magical power that ignored the Law of Heaven and Earth. In this regard, it was somewhat similar to the description of this Immortal Artifact.Thinking of this, Han Li couldn't help but look at the page again and read carefully.After about 15 minutes, he closed the entire ancient book and finally had a general understanding of the concept of Immortal Artifact.According to the book, the Profound Sky Treasure was a kind of treasure that was born by sensing the power of a certain world. It was originally a kind of Immortal Artifact. In the Immortal World, it was collectively called Innate Immortal Artifact.It often appeared at the beginning of a certain world, and it mostly appeared in the state of Spiritual Wood.After the Spiritual Wood sensed the essence of Heaven and Earth, it would blossom into Spiritual Flowers or Spiritual Fruits that ignored the Law of Heaven and Earth. Usually, only 4 or 5 of them could be born in a world. It was an extremely rare and precious thing.The flowering and fruiting cycle of these Spiritual Wood was also very unique. Most of them were calculated in 100,000 or even hundreds of thousands of years. Once they blossomed and bore fruit, they would rapidly decay in a few days or even a few minutes.With such a long growth cycle and such a fast decay time, it was almost impossible for people to obtain their Spiritual Flowers and Spiritual Fruits.According to the book, in addition to this type of Innate Immortal Artifact, there was also another type of Acquired Immortal Artifact. It was not born from the Heaven and Earth, but a treasure that contained the Power of Law created by Immortals.There was no difference in strength between the two. When comparing them specifically, it mainly depended on how much Power of Law they contained, or what type of Power of Law they could use.In addition, the strength of the person using the Immortal Artifact was naturally also an important factor.In terms of quantity, Innate Immortal Artifacts were much fewer than Acquired Immortal Artifacts. However, because they often had the possibility of further nurturing and growing, they were more popular among high-level Immortals.Of course, regardless of whether it was Innate Immortal Artifacts or Acquired Immortal Artifacts, they were very rare in the Immortal World. There were very few Itinerant Immortals who could possess Immortal Artifacts, and Immortals who could forge Acquired Immortal Artifacts were even rarer.Seeing this, Han Li could not help but miss the feeling of having the Profound Heavenly Spiritslayer Sword by his side.His heart thumped slightly, and his lips moved slightly, but he silently transmitted a few words.In just a moment, Luo Feng's figure appeared on the second floor of the Scripture Pavilion. He cupped his hands and bowed to Han Li.He asked, \"Senior Liu, what can I do for you?\"Han Li turned to look at him and got straight to the point. \"Do you have any immortal tools on Wu Meng Island?\"\"Immortal Artifacts \u2026 We don't have the fortune to possess such treasures. In the past, Lord Ancestral God also wanted to obtain one, but his wish was never fulfilled.In fact, let alone our Wu Meng Island, there are very few Ancestral Gods in the entire Blackwind Sea who possess Immortal Artifacts, \"Luo Feng said with a bitter smile.Although Han Li did not have much hope, he could not help but feel a little disappointed when he heard this answer.However, he soon felt relieved and asked, \"I just read from the ancient books that Ancestral Gods can condense the power of laws through the accumulation of faith power. Your Wu Meng Island's Ancestral God should have mastered it in the past. May I know what kind of law it is?\"Luo Feng was slightly startled when he heard this. A trace of embarrassment appeared on his face, but it quickly disappeared.He replied, \"What Lord Roman mastered is the power of water that is relatively common in the Blackwind Sea. Most of the Ancestral Gods that the nearby forces worship also mastered this kind of law.\"\"Power of water \u2026\"After a moment of contemplation, a thought suddenly occurred to Han Li, and he asked,He then continued to ask, \"When we were on the way to the Scripture Pavilion, we saw many people worshiping an Ancestral God statue. Is that statue the Earthly Incarnation of Wu Meng Island's Ancestral God?\"\"That Ancestral God statue \u2026 and the other statues on the island are only ordinary statues that are used to collect faith power. Although they can also play the role of communicating with the Ancestral God, they are not the true Earthly Incarnation.There is only one statue on the island that is the Earthly Incarnation of the Ancestral God, and it is currently sealed in the forbidden area of the clan, \"Luo Feng said with some hesitation.\"Where is the forbidden area?Han Li was clearly very interested in this and immediately asked, \"Take me there.\"\"To be honest, Ancestral God Roman's Earthly Incarnation has already shattered after being heavily injured by a powerful enemy. Now, only a head is left to worship.Senior Liu, if you want to see it, I can bring you there right now, \"Luo Feng said after a short pause.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the northwest of Wu Meng Island, there was a very steep cliff. It was more than a thousand meters high, and the bottom was covered with ferocious rugged black reefs.Waves slapped on it, constantly splashing white foam-like waves.The surface of the cliff was riddled with holes, and it was covered with countless dense sea erosion holes of different sizes and shapes. The surroundings were mostly covered with green seaweed and white salt stains, looking mottled. From time to time, some white sea crabs were swept out of the holes by the surging seawater.At this time, Han Li and Luo Feng were floating above the sea, facing this sea cliff.\"Senior Liu, this is where the remains of Ancestor God Roman's earth incarnation are.\"Luo Feng raised his hand and pointed at a seemingly ordinary sea erosion hole of a few dozen meters on the sea cliff.The hole appeared to be only slightly larger and was pitch-black inside. There didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary about it, but when Han Li released his spiritual sense into it, he immediately discovered that there was something special about it.He found that when his Divine Thought swept towards this hole, it was driven by an almost imperceptible strange force and swept towards the stone wall on the side.If it weren't for his Divine Thought that was far superior to ordinary people, he wouldn't even notice that his Divine Thought was disturbed. He would think that the hole was really just a stone wall.\"It's a bit interesting!\"Han Li murmured. His eyes flashed in blue light, and he immediately activated Bright Light Spirit Eyes to look into the hole.In the depths of the hole, there was a pale white water mist vortex spinning slowly. There was a very weak aura of law coming from it.\"After Ancestor God Wu Meng was seriously injured and fell into a deep sleep ten thousand years ago, he never woke up again. The water yuan seal here has also become weaker day by day. After another thousand years, I'm afraid it won't be able to cover this place.\" Luo Feng sighed as he flew into the hole.He crossed his hands slightly in front of him, and a series of blue symbols immediately flew out. After flashing a few times, they all went into the water mist vortex in the depths of the hole.The vortex shook slightly, and the misty water mist immediately reversed, opening a circular passage with the height of a person in the middle.\"Senior, please come with me.\"After Luo Feng called out, his figure flashed, and he passed through the vortex passageway and disappeared.Han Li also flew into the spatial rift behind him.Connected to the whirlpool passage was a dark passageway made of green stones. It was winding and extended towards the ground, with no end in sight. Every few feet, there was a white fluorescent stone embedded in the passageway, illuminating the path ahead.Han Li was not worried about anything. He just followed Luo Feng silently.The deeper the tunnel went, the denser the moisture and the water spiritual power around.After walking for a quarter of an hour, Han Li estimated that they had traveled at least five kilometers underground. They finally reached the end of the passageway, where an azure stone gate appeared in front of them.Luo Feng took out a green token, rubbed it slightly, and shot a green light into the stone door.\"Creak\", \"creak\", the stone door slowly opened, revealing a square stone room about a hundred meters in size.It wasn't appropriate to call it a stone room. The ground and walls here were uneven. It seemed to be rebuilt from an underground cave. Stalagmites hung down from the top of the cave, showing a translucent aqua blue color, like colored glass.Even the surrounding walls were made of similar materials. Through here, one could vaguely see the fast and slow sea currents outside. It could be seen that this place should be deep under the sea.Han Li glanced at the stone room and found that it was empty with almost no furnishings. Only in the middle, there was a black stone platform that was half the height of a person.The surface of the stone platform was engraved with zigzagging fine grooves, which extended all the way down and covered the entire ground.On the platform, there was a statue head that was no different from the size of a normal person's head. Its appearance was similar to Han Li's. It was the appearance of the ancestor god of Wu Meng Island, Roman.However, unlike the statues he had seen before, this head was blue and seemed to be carved with some kind of special crystal stone. Under the light of the surrounding white crystal beads, it looked crystal clear and exuded a strong water attribute spiritual power.Its face was as smooth as a mirror and looked lifelike, but the neck was extremely rough as if it was forcibly broken from the original body.Han Li stood a step away from the head and stared at it intently, but a strange feeling suddenly emerged in his heart.This feeling was as if the head statue in front of him was not a dead object, but a living thing that could breathe.He closed his eyes gently and released his Divine Sense, which instantly filled the entire stone room.Luo Feng, who had been standing behind him, only felt an indescribable huge Divine Sense power suddenly surged from all directions and swallowed his whole body. His body shook involuntarily, and cold sweat immediately dripped down from his forehead.Han Li ignored Luo Feng and just focused on casting his Divine Sense towards the head of the statue.At this time, he suddenly found that around the blue head, there was an invisible energy that was gathering towards the head.The energy looked very weak; each of them was as thin as a gossamer, as if they could be scattered with a wave of his hand, but the number was extremely large. It was so dense that it almost filled the entire stone room.At this moment, there was a light that was originally invisible to the naked eye flickering on the head. The rhythm of the light was very similar to the breathing of a cultivator. As it flickered between light and dark, it absorbed the weak energy in the surroundings bit by bit.\"It seems that this should be the so-called faith power \u2026\"Han Li retracted his Divine Sense and slowly muttered to himself thoughtfully.Behind him, Luo Feng's face was already pale, and he breathed a sigh of relief. In just a moment, the back of his clothes had been completely soaked.He took a deep breath, took a few steps forward, and patted a seemingly ordinary upside-down aqua blue stalagmite a few times.The ground made a series of \"kaka\" sounds, and a small stone platform slowly emerged from the ground with a stone box placed on it.Luo Feng opened the stone box and took out an old jade book from it.\"Senior Liu, this ancient book should be useful to you, please accept it.\" Luo Feng came to Han Li with the jade book in his hand, handed it over with both hands, and said.\"Ancient book \u2026 This is!\" Han Li took it casually and flipped through it. His face suddenly changed slightly.\"This is the cultivation method that Ancestor God Roman used to practice, Omnipotent Water Immortal Technique.I once heard that immortals who ascended from the lower realm must turn to practice Perfected Immortal cultivation method and transform the spiritual power in their body into Immortal spiritual power. Since senior came to the Immortal Realm illegally, you should not have a suitable cultivation method on hand. This Omnipotent Water Immortal Technique should be useful to you. \"Luo Feng said.\"I see, thank you, Patriarch Luo Feng.\" Han Li took a deep look at Luo Feng and nodded.\"Senior is too polite.This is a place at the bottom of the deep sea, where the spiritual power of water is rich. If senior wants to practice Omnipotent Water Immortal Technique, you can retreat here. \"Luo Feng grinned. He knew that the purpose of giving away the ancient book had finally been achieved, and his expression was a lot more relaxed.Han Li did not speak and carefully flipped through the jade book in his hand. After a while, he roughly skimmed through the contents.This Omnipotent Water Immortal Technique was a water attribute Perfected Immortal cultivation method. It should be able to be practiced to the later stage of Perfected Immortal.It was a pity that this cultivation method conflicted with his original cultivation method, and the achievements it could achieve were also quite far from his expectations.With this thought in mind, he handed the jade book back to Luo Feng.\"Senior Liu, you \u2026\" Luo Feng was a little surprised when he saw this.\"Although this Omnipotent Water Immortal Technique is not bad, it's a pity that water attribute cultivation methods are not suitable for me.Is there any place in the Blackwind Sea where I can get Perfected Immortal cultivation methods? \"Han Li shook his head regretfully and asked.Luo Feng pondered for a moment and said, \"The Blackwind Sea is located in a remote area, and there are very few Immortal cultivation methods. Basically, they are in the hands of those Ancestral Gods, and they will not give them to others. After all, if their cultivation methods fall into the hands of outsiders, they may expose their weaknesses.If you want to ask where else can I get other Immortal cultivation methods, I'm afraid that I can only go to the Blackwind Island in the center of the sea. There is a big auction there every 100 years, and there may be Immortal cultivation methods there, \"Luo Feng said.\"Big auction \u2026 I wonder when the next big auction will be held?\"Han Li touched his chin with his right hand and murmured to himself. A look of interest appeared in his eyes.Luo Feng thought for a moment and said, \"About ten years. However, the things that appear in this kind of big auction are usually very expensive.\"\"Ten years \u2026 I understand.Oh right, I have something that I need your help with. \"Han Li nodded slowly and changed the topic.Luo Feng's expression shook and he hurriedly replied, \"Please tell me, Senior.\"\u2026In the blink of an eye, four or five months passed.During this time, the Icy Crystal Race did not come for revenge. This made everyone on Wu Meng Island heave a sigh of relief.In the clan leader's hall, Luo Feng paced back and forth anxiously. From time to time, he would come to the door and look into the distance with an anxious expression.In the past few months, he had sent people to collect some secret techniques or cultivation methods related to Nascent Soul confinement according to Han Li's request.However, this kind of secret technique was very rare. After a few months, he only found three or four kinds. After sending them to Han Li, it was obvious that he was not satisfied with them.This made Luo Feng somewhat anxious.With no other choice, he could only send a Body Integration Stage elder to the central island of the Blackwind Sea, Blackwind Island, with a large sum of spirit stones.That was the most prosperous place in the Blackwind Sea. If the cultivators of the various islands wanted to find something, they would go there.However, today was already the third day after he was scheduled to return, but that elder had yet to return.At this moment, a white light appeared in the distant sky and quickly approached.Luo Feng was overjoyed and walked out of the hall.The white light quickly approached and landed in front of the main hall, revealing the figure of a middle-aged man.Luo Feng hurriedly asked, \"Elder Han Liang, you've finally returned. How was the situation?\"\"I encountered some trouble on the way and had to take a detour.I spent most of the spirit stones, but fortunately, I didn't disappoint you. \"The middle-aged man said as he took out a jade box. There were a dozen or so jade slips inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn a secret room of a small courtyard.Pieces of white paper and crumpled paper balls were scattered everywhere on the ground and the table, looking a bit messy.On these pieces of white paper, one could see a variety of complex and mysterious formation runes.Han Li sat at the table, quickly scribbling on a piece of white paper with a brush in his hand.After a while, he raised his head, sighed, and put down the pen in his hand.These days, he had been racking his brains, combining all his past memories and understanding of formations in an attempt to crack the chains of law on the nascent soul. Unfortunately, there had been no substantial breakthrough.Although he had also designed several restrictions that seemed to be able to shake these chains of laws, most of them were only feasible in theory. After careful consideration, all of them were rejected without exception.The biggest problem was that he knew too little about the eight chains of law on the nascent soul. If he could find out what laws these chains contained, there might be a glimmer of hope.At this moment, a white light flew in from the outside and turned into a sound transmission talisman.Han Li waved his hand and the sound transmission talisman was sucked over. After probing it with his spiritual sense, a trace of joy appeared on his face. He got up and walked out.After a while, when he returned again, there was a jade box in his hand. There were more than ten jade slips inside.He took out a jade slip and stuck it to his forehead, then probed it with his spiritual sense.After a while, he put down the jade slip with a frown. He took out another jade slip and continued to probe it.Soon, he had checked most of the jade slips in the jade box, but his frown became even tighter.These jade slips recorded secret techniques related to sealing Nascent Souls. Although they were more advanced than the previous ones, they were still of no help to him in his current predicament. It was no wonder that a small force like Luo Feng's was able to collect so many jade slips. They had probably reached their limit already.After all, he had asked Luo Feng to search for them before because he was hoping for a fluke.\"It seems that I will have to personally go to Black Wind Island in a few days.\"With this thought in mind, he picked up another green jade slip and stuck it to his forehead.But this time, after a brief inspection, his expression immediately became a bit more solemn.After a long while, he let out a long breath, and a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.The jade chip recorded a secret technique named \"Heaven Separation Heart Refinement\". It was not a technique that targeted the Nascent Soul but a secret technique to confine magical power. However, after a brief consideration, he found that it was rather similar to the eight chains that bound his Nascent Soul.At the end of the jade slip, it was mentioned that this secret technique had evolved from a type of Divine Ability called the Essence Isolation Chain.\"Elemental Isolating Chains \u2026 Could it be that the chains on the Nascent Soul are \u2026\" Han Li muttered to himself.Although he couldn't be sure, this secret technique alone was worth studying. Perhaps he could find a way to break the chains on his Nascent Soul.Han Li's eyes flashed slightly. He picked up the remaining jade slips and checked them one by one. Unfortunately, he didn't find anything useful in the remaining jade slips.He took a deep breath and threw the rest of the jade slips into his storage bracelet. He then picked up the green jade slip that recorded the \"Heaven Separation Heart Refinement\" secret technique and stuck it to his forehead.Several days later, Luo Feng once again received an order from Han Li to collect some materials.This caused the somewhat anxious Luo Feng to let out a sigh of relief.Although the materials that Liu Ming wanted him to collect were quite valuable, fortunately, there weren't many of them and he could basically collect them.\u2026 \u2026Half a month later.A series of muffled sounds suddenly rang out from the originally quiet courtyard.Then, a dozen or so milky white pillars of light soared around the courtyard, forming a layer of white light barrier that enveloped the entire courtyard.The changes didn't stop there. A large expanse of yellow light appeared around the courtyard, condensing into a yellow light barrier that enveloped the courtyard along with the white light barrier.Then, with a sharp whistle, eight large silver banners appeared around the courtyard. With a slight sway, countless silver talisman characters appeared and turned into a large expanse of silver mist that enveloped the courtyard within a hundred feet.At this moment, the sun had already set and the entire Wu Meng Island was enveloped in orange light.Luo Feng and a few elders of the tribe stood on a tall platform and looked at the courtyard that had already been engulfed by the surging silver mist from afar. A hint of shock appeared on their faces.\"What is Senior Liu trying to do? Why is he causing such a huge commotion?\" Luo Hanliang, who had been ordered to search for the Secret Technique on Black Wind Island, could not help but ask.\"We don't need to think too much about what Senior Liu is trying to do, and we definitely shouldn't ask too many questions,\" Luo Feng said in a deep voice.\"Yes.\" Although Luo Hanliang still had a hint of doubt on his face, he still agreed.Luo Feng turned to look at the others and slowly said with a solemn expression, \"Elders, although the Blue Crystal Race hasn't made any movements so far, it's only calm on the surface. Moreover, all of you know that the Blue Crystal Race isn't the only power that covets our tribe.Right now, the safety of our tribe can be said to depend on Senior Liu alone. Do not do anything that might anger him, \"Luo Feng said slowly as he turned to look at the others with a solemn expression.Everyone's expressions trembled and they all agreed in unison.Luo Feng pondered for a moment before saying, \"Pass down my order. From today onwards, seal all the entrances and exits of the island. At the same time, strengthen the patrols around the island. Don't let anyone disturb Senior Liu.Recently, there have been many suspicious people on the island. You must pay more attention to them. Senior Liu's identity must not be exposed. \"Luo Feng pondered for a moment before instructing in a deep voice.The others acknowledged and flew away. Soon, only Luo Feng was left. He looked at Han Li's courtyard in the distance, thinking about something.At this moment, in the open space of the small courtyard, a huge formation was slowly operating. Countless silver lines interweaved on the ground, flickering between bright and dark. There were seven silver pillars in the surroundings that were also engraved with runes. They were arranged in the shape of the Big Dipper, looking somewhat similar to the formation of the Realm Temple's Star Gathering Platform.Han Li sat in the center of the formation, not moving at all.Time passed slowly, and the sun soon set completely. Darkness once again enveloped the entire island.The stars tonight were abnormally bright, and they flickered incessantly.Han Li looked up at the night sky with a smile on his face. He muttered an incantation and waved his hand to cast a spell onto the formation.Weng weng!An incomparably dazzling light appeared in the formation, and a huge wave of spiritual power rippled out. Even though he had set up three layers of restrictions around the courtyard, they were unable to completely block it.At this moment, Han Li could no longer care about these things. His two hands quickly moved in front of him.The formation's operation speed suddenly increased, and the Big Dipper in the night sky slightly lit up. Bright starlight began to fall down and converged toward the small courtyard, forming seven starlight pillars.These starlight pillars did not fall on his body. Instead, they fell on the seven silver stone pillars in the formation.The runes on the stone pillars immediately lit up, and the entire stone pillar quickly became crystal clear.As the starlight continued to converge, the runes on the seven stone pillars became brighter and brighter. With a flash, they moved as if they were alive, forming seven patterns that looked like eyes.Pu pu pu!Seven muffled sounds rang out in succession!Each of the seven eye patterns shot a thumb-thick starlight into Han Li's lower abdomen, chest, eyebrows, and other places.Han Li frowned, and a trace of pain flashed across his face. Then, seven balls of bluish starlight appeared on his lower abdomen.The starlight that had been injected into his body flashed, and transformed into silver filaments. Then, they started to wander in his meridians.At the same time, the magic power in his Dantian also started to circulate in his meridians.The starlight filaments and the magic power were both in his meridians, but they did not conflict with each other. Instead, they were swimming in harmony.Han Li took a deep breath. Then, he formed a seal with both hands, and his hands exuded traces of white light.His meridians fluctuated, and countless tiny white runes appeared out of thin air.The magic power and the starlight filaments were enveloped by these white runes. Then, they lit up at the same time, and slowly fused into one. Suddenly, they transformed into strands of lightning-like bright silver filaments of light. Then, they started to travel in his meridians.A unique aura exuded from these light filaments.These light filaments were specially created to break the Nascent Soul's chains. Shi Mu had fused the power of starlight and magic power. Then, he had used a secret technique to evolve this special magical power.\"I hope it works,\" Han Li muttered to himself.The silver light filaments wandered in his meridians. Then, they finally converged in his Dantian. Then, they intertwined with each other, and transformed into a layer of silver light net that wrapped around the Nascent Soul. Then, it immediately tightened.At this moment, Han Li urged in his mind, and started to operate the Spirit Refinement Technique.\"Boom!\"The vast power of his Divine Sense flooded his entire Dantian. Then, it transformed into countless Divine Sense Crystal Filaments. They passed through the gaps of the silver light net, and shot towards the Nascent Soul.Just as the silver light net and the Divine Sense Crystal Filaments were about to touch the Nascent Soul, a \"Buzz\" sound was heard. Then, a black light flashed on the surface of the Nascent Soul. Then, the eight black chains emerged.The black chains seemed to have felt threatened. So, they started to tremble violently. Then, an innumerable amount of black mist emerged.The silver light filaments and the Divine Sense Crystal Filaments collided with the black mist. Then, a \"Pi Pi Pa Pa\" sound was heard.The black mist was gradually torn apart as the silver light filaments and the Divine Sense Crystal Filaments continued to emerge.Finally, some of the Divine Sense Crystal Filaments and the silver light filaments flew out of the torn black mist. Then, they pierced the black chains.The black chains trembled violently. Then, the black light on the surface of the chains faded away.Han Li was delighted to see this.The silver light filaments were effective against the black chains.He urged in his mind. The Divine Sense Crystal Filaments flashed. Then, they transformed into crystal blades. Then, they fiercely chopped at the black chains.A loud \"Keng Keng\" sound was heard.The crystal blades chopped at the chains. Then, they immediately shattered. Then, they dispersed into specks of sparkling light. However, the black chains trembled even more violently.Suddenly, the eight black chains shook violently. Then, they emitted a crashing sound. Then, they suddenly lit up.Countless tiny black magic characters emerged. Then, they blocked the attack of the Divine Sense Crystal Filaments.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis sudden scene made Han Li's face sink, but he quickly regained his composure.With the strange nature of the black chains, this situation was within his expectations.After letting out a breath, he urged the technique in his mind. More silver threads of light than before flowed into his dantian and bombarded the black chains.A loud crackling sound was heard!Although the silver threads of light were still destroyed as soon as they touched the black runes, the black runes were also being consumed.The blades formed by the Spiritual Sense Crystal Threads also continued to cut down.Wave after wave of silver threads of light and the Spiritual Sense Crystal Threads bombarded, and the black runes around the chains became dimmer.However, there was not much joy on Han Li's face.The black runes were indeed decreasing, but at this moment, the Fa Li in his body was almost depleted.Although he had made sufficient preparations before, so that his five viscera and dantian could store the Fa Li to the limit, it seemed that it was still far from enough.Han Li let loose a low cry before abruptly activating all of the remaining magic power within his body. All of the silver threads within his dantian flashed before transforming into eight silver hands that pierced through the remaining black runes and grabbed onto the eight black chains before tugging at them with all his might.The black chains immediately tightened, and a burst of pain came from his Nascent Soul.Han Li clenched his teeth, but his heart was thumping!Ever since his Nascent Soul was sealed by the black chains, he had not felt anything. At this moment, he finally had some connection with his body.Without saying anything, he urged the Spirit Cultivation Technique, and all the Spiritual Sense Crystal Threads flowed into his dantian, splitting into two. After a flash of crystal light, they turned into two crystal axes.Several silver arcs of lightning flew out from the lightning palms, wrapped around the crystal axes, and fiercely chopped down on the taut black chains.A loud sound!The taut black chains shook violently, and cracks appeared on the places where they were chopped.Han Li was overjoyed, and drove the giant axes to chop down again.At this moment, a strange change suddenly occurred!The void around his body fluctuated, and a black chain appeared out of thin air. Then, without waiting for Han Li to react, it flashed and disappeared into his body.The surrounding starlight array seemed to be unable to stop it at all.\"Ka!\"The black chain wound around Han Li's Nascent Soul and connected the other eight chains together.Buzz!Countless black runes appeared on the surface of the nine black chains. As they spun, light shone in all directions, causing the two silver hands that were grabbing onto the chains to be pierced by rays of piercing black light and dissipated.Clang!When the sparkling axe struck the chain, it immediately shattered and turned into a sparkling light that dissipated.\u2026At the same time, in a great hall in the depths of a desert in the Immortal World.The zombie-like man stretched out his hand, and his whole body was shrouded in a dazzling black light. Countless black magic characters were flickering and throbbing inside the light.The chains around his body rattled, as if countless tentacles were dancing wildly. They struck the ground and the walls of the hall, producing a series of loud noises.The zombie-like man lowered his raised arm, and the black light on his body quickly dissipated. The wildly dancing chains also quickly calmed down and fell to the ground.\"Seventh Brother, I will help you for the last time since we are master and disciple,\" the zombie-like man muttered to himself. Then, he closed his eyes.\u2026In the small courtyard, Han Li suddenly stood up. His eyes flickered with a blue light as he looked around. His complexion was extremely gloomy.At the same time, he released his divine sense without any hesitation. It instantly covered the area of several thousand miles around Wu Meng Island. However, he couldn't find anything.After a long while, he slowly sat down with a gloomy expression on his face.The black chain that suddenly appeared just now must have been sent here by an extremely powerful person who cast a spell through space.But, it seemed that the cultivation of the person who had placed the seal on his Nascent Soul was far more terrifying than he had expected.Suddenly, a thought flashed through Han Li's mind, and he promptly urged his divine sense.A soft buzzing sound was heard!A huge divine sense surged into his Dantian, and formed a layer of crystal light that enveloped his Nascent Soul.Doing this might not be useful, but he hoped that it would be able to shield his Nascent Soul from the outside world.After doing all this, Han Li sat down cross-legged again. He turned his hand, and took out a thousand-year-old Cloud Crane Grass. Then, he put it into his mouth and chewed it.Although this attempt had failed in the end, he was glad that there was a chance that this method could shake the black chain.Although the black chain that had appeared out of nowhere in the end had disrupted his plan, and caused him to fail at the last step, if he had enough magic power to support him, he might be able to forcefully break it even if another chain appeared.\u2026A month later, in a secluded courtyard on Wu Meng Island.During the night, seven huge white pillars of light fell from the sky, and enveloped the entire small courtyard.Han Li, who was dressed in green clothes, was sitting cross-legged in the courtyard's courtyard with his eyes closed.Countless specks of lustrous white light surrounded him like countless white fireflies. They slowly flew around him, and occasionally touched his skin. But, they quickly bounced back and floated in the air.In the courtyard's courtyard, there was a faint white light, as if it was covered by a layer of white gauze. However, what was emitted from within was a strong and gentle fluctuation of the power of the stars.At this moment, the seven balls of blue light on Han Li's chest and abdomen gradually disappeared. The white light that enveloped him suddenly brightened, and then dissipated bit by bit. The seven pillars of light in the night sky also disappeared.He slowly opened his eyes and looked up at the starry sky. There was a helpless expression on his face, and he said with a bitter smile, \"As expected, it still doesn't work \u2026\"Over the past month, he had tried many methods to increase the magic power in his body, but none of them had any effect.In the past few days, he continued to cultivate the Little Big Dipper Origin Technique in an attempt to find a way to increase the power of the Five Organs Origin Forging Technique.However, although the power of the stars would still descend upon him, the seven profound orifices in his body were already full, and he could no longer absorb any more power of the stars.Han Li sighed and stared at the seven stars of the Big Dipper in the night sky. His vision gradually became blurry, and he only felt that a few of the stars were flickering and becoming blurry, as if they were about to overlap.At this moment, his heart jumped, and his mind suddenly flashed with a thought: Since I can't increase the magic power in my body, why not cultivate an incarnation?With this thought, Han Li reached out and touched his chin, thinking carefully.If he used an incarnation to cultivate and accumulate magic power, he could naturally bypass the situation of his Nascent Soul being sealed in his body. As long as the incarnation could provide him with enough magic power, he would be able to solve the troublesome black chains.But, where would this incarnation come from?Although Han Li had previously cultivated the Mysterious Nascent Transformation Technique, and had also cultivated the Wood Spirit Nascent Soul, this technique required him to condense a second Nascent Soul.In order to condense a second Nascent Soul, not only was the requirement harsh, but it also required a large amount of energy and time, which was what he didn't want to waste the most right now.The other incarnation techniques he knew, without exception, required a large amount of time and energy, and were also not advisable.Just as he was hesitating, the statue head in the forbidden area of Wu Meng Island appeared in his mind, and his eyes immediately lit up.\"That's right, the incarnation of an Earth Spirit is also an incarnation \u2026\"With this thought, Han Li immediately stood up from the ground, and with a wave of his hand, a ray of light flew out from his sleeve and landed somewhere on the island.\u2026About a quarter of an hour later, in the forbidden area of the seabed northwest of Wu Meng Island, two figures appeared.One of them wore a green robe and was tall. It was Han Li, and behind him stood a man in a scholar's robe with a puzzled expression. Naturally, it was Luo Feng.Just now, he was cultivating in the cave when he suddenly received Han Li's voice transmission glyph, and immediately rushed here. At this moment, he was a little confused.\"Senior Liu, you asked me to come to this forbidden area. Is there something urgent?\" Luo Feng couldn't help but ask.\"There are some things I need to ask you in a bit.\" Han Li simply said this, and didn't explain much.After saying this, he walked straight to the front of the stone platform, and reached out to hold the blue statue head.After looking at it for a moment, his eyes flashed blue, and he pointed at the forehead of the head with one finger.Seeing this, Luo Feng's heart skipped a beat, and he subconsciously wanted to stop it, but in the end, he didn't do anything. He just leaned forward and stood there with his mouth slightly open.The moment the tip of Han Li's finger touched the forehead of the statue, a ray of light that couldn't be seen by the naked eye suddenly lit up from the head of the statue, and it rippled like water.Although this ray of light wasn't very strong, and it didn't have much destructive power, the moment it touched Han Li, his body suddenly trembled, and an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.He was surprised to find that the chains in his Nascent Soul actually had a faint resonance with this ray of light. At this moment, they were fluctuating with the light, and there was a small degree of trembling.Han Li thought for a moment, and the azure light in his hand suddenly brightened. A strand of pure Fa Li shot out from the tip of his finger, and entered the head of the statue.Suddenly, there seemed to be a storm within the head, and countless strands of power of faith crazily swirled. Suddenly, several strands of light blue Fa Li surged out, and directly collided with the strand of azure Fa Li that Han Li had sent in.Although the azure Fa Li was pure, there was only a very thin strand, and it immediately dissipated like smoke.Seeing the strands of blue Fa Li, Han Li was overjoyed. He suddenly withdrew his finger from the head of the statue, and turned to Luo Feng.\"Clan Leader Luo, the incarnation of your Wu Meng Island's ancestor god, aside from the power of law, did it have any other abilities?\"At this moment, all of the abnormalities and ripples on the head of the statue disappeared.Seeing that the head of the statue was fine, Luo Feng slightly relaxed. When he heard Han Li's question, he immediately replied, \"That's right.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Sure enough \u2026\"When Han Li heard Luo Feng's words, he murmured thoughtfully.In this way, when the Earth Deity Incarnation absorbed the faith power, not only could it be used to condense the power of law, but it could also be transformed into spiritual power for use.In other words, if he started to walk the path of Earth Immortal now and refined his own Earth Deity Incarnation, and accumulated enough spiritual power, it was expected to assist his Nascent Soul to completely get rid of the shackles of those mysterious chains.And judging from the resonance between the faith power in the head of the statue and the chains in his Nascent Soul, refining the Earth Deity Incarnation might have other unexpected effects on getting rid of the shackles.However, if he really wanted to do this, there would still be a lot of trouble.After all, once he embarked on the path of Earth Immortal, there was a risk that the spiritual power in his body would be contaminated by the faith power. If he was not careful, he might be reduced to an Earth Immortal forever.But if he waited until the Nascent Soul got rid of the shackles, and the spiritual power had not really been contaminated by the faith power, it was not impossible to give up this path and walk on other paths again.Han Li's expression appeared calm, but his heart was in a state of constant conflict.\"There are a lot of classics about Earth Immortal in the library pavilion. Most of them are just introductions, but they don't explain how to embark on the path of Earth Immortal. I wonder if Patriarch Luo knows anything about this?\" After a while, Han Li said to Luo Feng.\"Senior Liu, do you also want to practice this path of Earth Immortal?\" Luo Feng asked in surprise.\"Tell me what you know,\" Han Li said in a noncommittal manner.\"Under normal circumstances, most Earth Immortals will first choose to become an existence similar to the Ancestral God of their own clan. Through continuous reproduction, they will give birth to several or even dozens of generations of descendants. Through their long-term worship over the years, they will accumulate the power of faith bit by bit.After adapting to the faith power and having a certain amount of accumulation and buffer, they can really embark on the path of Earth Immortal cultivation \u2026 \"Seeing this, Luo Feng immediately said with assurance.\"Does it have to be one's descendants to provide the power of faith?\" Han Li asked as he raised an eyebrow.\"It's not completely impossible for ordinary people, but the Faith Energy they provide is usually rather heterogeneous, and it's practically impossible for Earthly Immortals who are still at the Universe Enlightened Ancestral God Realm to condense it.The power of faith of one's own direct descendants is the most devout and has the highest compatibility with oneself. As time passes, the number of descendants will increase day by day. Therefore, most people who want to walk this path will choose to spend some time to nurture their own family, \"Luo Feng explained.\"I see. Please continue.\" Han Li nodded.\"Due to the fact that the cultivation speed of an Earthly Immortal and the strength of the power of law condensed are closely related to the amount of faith power, if one wants to quickly strengthen his strength, he must constantly expand the territory he controls and seize as many resources as possible.Only in this way can we nurture more clansmen and allow our race to expand as quickly as possible \u2026 \"Luo Feng was currently the person with the highest cultivation base in the Crow Meng Tribe. Adding the fact that he had spent so much time cultivating in the Blackwind Sea Region, he was quite clear about how to become an Earthly Immortal and how to progress in the future.However, when Han Li finished listening to Luo Feng's eloquent explanation, he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.The path to becoming an Earthly Immortal was not as easy as he had imagined. With his current situation, it was impossible for him to spend a long time to nurture a huge family.As for the future expansion, it would definitely affect the interests of other Universe Enlightened Gods, and he would inevitably fall into endless disputes and killings. This was something he absolutely did not want to happen.\"Patriarch Luo, what you just said was the general situation. Is there another way?\" Han Li suddenly asked.Luo Feng hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Well \u2026 there is indeed another way. One can not walk the path of Universe Enlightened Gods and directly cultivate to become an Earthly Immortal.\"\"This method should require some special conditions, right?\" Han Li said thoughtfully.\"That's right. Although this method of directly cultivating to become an Earthly Immortal is widespread in the Blackwind Sea Region and almost all high level cultivators have heard of it, very few have ever succeeded.This is because this method first requires two conditions to be fulfilled, \"Luo Feng said with a wry smile.\"Let's hear it.\" Han Li said without any change in expression.\"First, the cultivator's Earthly Spirit Incarnation cannot use ordinary materials. It must be a natural treasure that contains the Power of Law.Second, the Earthly Immortal cultivation method must be one that can directly skip the Universe Enlightened God stage. In other words, it must be a high-grade Earthly Immortal cultivation method that can directly condense the mixed Power of Faith of ordinary people, \"Luo Feng said solemnly.\"Materials that contain the Power of Law \u2026 High-grade Earthly Immortal cultivation method \u2026\" Han Li murmured to himself and frowned.\"To be honest with Senior Liu, it is impossible for our clan to have a high-grade Earthly Immortal cultivation method. I'm afraid there are only a few of them in the entire Blackwind Sea Region \u2026 As for the materials, Ancient God Roman had left some materials in the clan. It's just that my knowledge is shallow and I can't recognize most of them. I don't know if there are materials that contain the Power of Law in them. Senior, you can go and see for yourself,\" Luo Feng said.\"Alright, Patriarch Luo, please lead the way.\" Han Li nodded.The two of them quickly left the forbidden area and appeared in a secret underground chamber in a hidden side hall.The secret chamber was not big. There were more than ten wooden shelves with many materials on them. There were materials from demonic beasts, some spiritual herbs, ores, and so on.These items appeared to be quite rare, but that was only true for Spatial Tempering and Body Integration cultivators.Luo Feng obviously knew this as well. He led Han Li to a green jade shelf in the innermost part of the room. The jade shelf was enveloped by a layer of solid blue light, and a small pile of things could be vaguely seen.\"Senior Liu, the things that Lord Ancient God left behind are all here,\" Luo Feng said to Han Li.After saying that, he took out a blue token and shook it slightly in front of the blue light. A blue light shot out.\"Pa!\" The blue light restriction around the jade shelf suddenly dissipated.Most of the things on the shelf were round black ores that emitted an inexplicable cold wave. They seemed to be some kind of special material.In addition to these ores, there were a few miscellaneous items. There were a few pieces of orange wood that emitted a fragrant smell, a light gold ore, two broken short halberd magic treasures, and a palm-sized white jade medallion.Han Li picked up these things one by one and carefully examined them. He couldn't help but shake his head.He recognized the orange wood and the golden ore. They were two kinds of precious refining materials. He didn't know what the black ore was, but it obviously didn't contain any power of law.As for the short halberd, it should have been a powerful spirit treasure in the past. Unfortunately, for some reason, its spirituality had been damaged for a long time and it was no longer useful.Luo Feng couldn't help but sigh when he saw Han Li's expression.In his heart, he hoped that Han Li could cultivate to become an Earth Immortal. In that case, he wouldn't be able to leave this sea and protect the Luo family for a long time. As long as there was enough time, the Luo family could give birth to a new Ancient God.If it wasn't for that, he wouldn't have brought Han Li here so easily.Right at this moment, a light sound of surprise sounded out.It was Han Li picking up the white jade token and carefully examining it.\"Senior Liu, is there anything special about this jade token?\" Luo Feng was slightly stunned.He'd looked through the things here countless times, and this jade token was the same. However, he didn't notice anything unusual about it.Han Li didn't answer Luo Feng immediately. He carefully sized up the jade token for a long time before he spoke slowly, \"I can't explain it in a short time. This jade token seems to be slightly strange. I'll take it back and study it.\"\"No problem,\" said Luo Feng immediately.\"As for the materials that contain the energy of the law and high-grade Earthly Immortal cultivation techniques, I'll have to trouble you to help me keep an eye out for them. Inform me immediately if there's any news,\" instructed Han Li.\"Senior Liu, don't worry. I'll arrange it right away,\" replied Luo Feng.\u2026After a short moment, within the secret room of the courtyard.Han Li sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion while his gaze flickered incessantly, and he revealed an expression of contemplation.Presently, it would seem that if he wanted to solve the problem of his Nascent Soul being sealed in a short period of time, then he could only think of a way to take that unusual path to become an Earthly Immortal.But those two conditions had to be resolved first.This Blackwind Sea Area was extremely vast, and there were a few places that were similar to secret realms. Even though danger lurked in every corner, there were some treasures of the heavens and the earth, strange demon beasts, and so on and so forth. Perhaps he might be able to find one or two materials that contained the energy of the law.When he thought up to here, he suddenly thought of something and withdrew an object. It was precisely the eye left behind by the cyclops giant he killed in the mysterious bubble earlier.The light emitted by this eye was actually able to cause one's movements to become sluggish, and it had truly left a deep impression on him.Even though he'd examined this object in the past, but he was pressed for time at that time, so he didn't examine it carefully. Now he had to study it properly.If it contained a trace of the energy of the law, then it would save him a great deal of effort.Han Li muttered something, and his eyes flickered with blue light. At the same time, a black mark split open between his eyebrows, and a jet-black eye emerged. It was the Law Eye of Destruction.The three eyes lit up at the same time, and each shot out a ray of light.The three rays of light, two blue and one black, converged together and slowly merged.Han Li muttered something, and his hands were constantly forming seals.The three rays of light quickly merged completely, and with a flash, they turned into a black and blue eyeball, emitting circles of strange black and blue light waves that enveloped the eye in his hand.At the same time, he also released his Divine Sense, and a series of Divine Sense Crystal Threads emerged, wrapped around the eye, and penetrated into it.\"This is \u2026\"After a moment, Han Li's heart was filled with joy.Under the unreserved exploration of the power of his Divine Sense, he really made some discoveries.In the depths of this eye, a few extremely faint white light spots vaguely emerged.With a thought, Han Li's Divine Sense Thread changed again, turning into a misty state. He closed his eyes and carefully sensed these white spots.After a moment, he suddenly opened his eyes, and his eyes flickered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li suppressed the excitement in his heart as thoughts began to churn in his mind.It seemed that his guess was right. The light beam that had a sluggish effect from the one-eyed giant was an attack that contained some kind of power of law.It was just that he didn't dare to confirm what kind of Law this solitary eye was emitting.However, most of the methods this giant used were of the earth attribute, and it had previously used some kind of magical power that increased the gravity of its opponent. Could it be that the law of earth contained in the eye was a subsidiary law of weight?\"Perhaps \u2026\"Han Li shook his head and stopped thinking about it.Regardless of what law it contained, it was enough to know that it was a material that contained the power of law.With a thought from Han Li, the black and blue eye in front of him disappeared in a flash, and a hint of exhaustion appeared on his face.He flipped his hand and took out a cloud crane grass and swallowed it. After a while, he recovered.Han Li put the eye back into the storage magic tool, and flipped his hand to take out another object. It was the human-faced walnut that he had examined with his spirit sense before.Han Li pursed his lips and muttered something again. His eyes and the Law Eye of Destruction between his eyebrows flashed and shot out three rays of light again, condensing into the black and blue eyeball.The black and blue ripples enveloped the human-faced walnut, and the Spiritual Sense Crystal Thread appeared again and penetrated into the walnut.Time passed slowly, and the corners of Han Li's mouth rose again as he opened his eyes.The black and blue eyeball disappeared in a flash, and the Spiritual Sense Crystal Thread also withdrew from the walnut.He took out another cloud crane grass and swallowed it. Then, he played with the human-faced walnut in his hand, and a hint of joy appeared on his face.Although it was very weak, this time he did feel that the walnut contained a rather pure trace of the law of earth.In the following time, he took out a few other human-faced walnuts and examined them one by one. Sure enough, they were all the same.It seemed that his luck was really good. The things that he obtained by chance in the gap between the worlds were actually so extraordinary.\"It seems that one of the two problems of cultivating to become an Earth Immortal has been solved, but I'll have to think carefully about which one to choose between this eye and this walnut.\" Han Li let out a long sigh, and his eyes narrowed slightly as he pondered again.According to the information obtained from Luo Feng, the type of law the Earth God's incarnation would condense had a lot to do with the type of law power the materials used to refine the statue.The special incarnation he wanted to refine was directly related to the power of laws contained in the materials.Han Li quickly shook his head.It was still too early to think about this. The most important thing now was to find a high-level Earth Immortal cultivation method.He carefully put away the Human-faced Walnut, then flipped his hand and took out another item. It was the white jade token.A blue radiance appeared in Han Li's eyes as he activated his Clear Spirit Eyes.In his field of vision, the surface of the white jade tablet was enveloped by a faint layer of blue light.This blue halo gave Han Li a strange feeling. It was definitely not a simple restriction.In the blue light, one could vaguely see many wave-like phantoms, which contained a hint of water elemental fluctuations. Obviously, the person who cast the restriction on this jade token was also Ancestor God Roman.However, Luo Feng and the others didn't seem to notice the blue light on the jade tablet.Han Li looked at the jade tablet in his hand with a trace of curiosity in his eyes. He flicked his fingers.More than a dozen white lights flew out and landed around him. They were more than a dozen white formation flags.A dazzling white light emerged from the formation flags and condensed into a lotus-shaped white formation that buzzed incessantly.Han Li waved his hand and threw the white jade tablet out. It was immediately caught by the white formation and suspended in mid-air.He made a gesture with both hands and struck out a series of hand signs.In the surrounding lotus-shaped formation, countless white runes emerged. Following Han Li's hand signs, they gathered towards the jade tablet and penetrated into it.The blue halo on the jade tablet immediately lit up and resisted the invasion of the white runes. However, these white runes changed unpredictably under Han Li's control. Little by little, they still broke through the blockade of the blue halo and invaded the jade tablet.The restriction on the white jade tablet was extraordinary. It wasn't easy to forcibly break it. Fortunately, Han Li had done a lot of research on Array Restrictions. Coupled with his powerful Divine Sense and Brightsight Spirit Eyes, he was able to see many clues. So, he wasn't at his wit's end.As time passed, the blue halo on the jade tablet became dimmer and dimmer. Soon, only a thin layer remained.\"Go!\"Han Li shouted in a low voice. His hands suddenly moved faster.The white lotus-shaped formation suddenly lit up. Countless white runes emerged and converged in one place. They formed more than a dozen white awls and fiercely pierced the jade tablet.Bang!The last layer of blue light on the jade tablet flickered a few times. Then, it finally shattered.Han Li was overjoyed. He was about to wave his hand and grab the jade tablet.But at this time, something strange happened!Some of the runes on the jade tablet wriggled as if they were alive.A dazzling white light radiated from the jade tablet. It condensed into a mass of white clouds. Then, it issued a rumbling sound that sounded like muffled thunder.\"What is this?!\" Han Li was startled. He suddenly stood up.A large amount of white clouds continuously gushed out of the jade tablet. They circled around it. Soon, they formed a strange whirlpool several feet in size.A dark hole appeared in the center of the whirlpool. At first, it was only the size of a fist. But as the whirlpool rotated, it became bigger and bigger. After a few breaths, it became the size of a millstone. Violent spatial fluctuations spread out from it.It was dark and unfathomable. It was unknown where it led to.Han Li looked at the strange passage in front of him. He quickly calmed down. He closed his eyes and released his Divine Sense to explore it.But after a while, he opened his eyes and smiled helplessly.There seemed to be a strange power inside the passage. It blocked his Divine Sense. It made it impossible for him to explore in detail.This power wasn't weak. If he wanted to force his way in, he could naturally do it with his Divine Sense. But now, half of his Divine Sense was used to isolate his Nascent Soul from the outside world. So, he couldn't use his full strength.He stood on the spot for a long time, and after a moment of hesitation, his figure flashed and he leaped into the pitch black hole.Inside the hole was a passage with a radius of ten feet. It was surrounded by bright white light. A hundred steps away, there was a dark exit floating in the void.As soon as he walked out of the hole, a strange fragrance immediately greeted him.Han Li unconsciously wrinkled his nose and swept his gaze around with a frown.He saw that he was surrounded by a lush ancient forest. It was less than a mile in radius. It was surrounded by a thick mist. It seemed to be a small secret realm.After a little observation, he found that the World Spirit Qi here seemed to be similar to the Black Wind Sea. It didn't look like a paradise.Most of the ancient trees in the surroundings were more than a thousand feet tall. Their trunks were perfectly straight, and there were many branches near the top that supported a large verdant canopy. They were connected to each other, causing the entire forest to appear somewhat gloomy.There were few shrubs growing in the forest, and no animals could be seen. It looked dead and lifeless.Through the gaps between the ancient trees, Han Li saw a relatively open area deep in the forest. There seemed to be a square.He passed through the forest and slowly walked over. He found that it wasn't a square, but there were no ancient trees within a radius of ten feet, making it seem a bit empty.In the middle of this open area, there was a strange purple flower growing alone. It was shaped like a peony, but it was as large as a lotus leaf. It was dark purple, and its leaves were somewhat similar to a banana. Its stamen was shaped like a cockscomb. It looked quite strange.The strange fragrance he smelled just now was emitted from its body.A few dozen feet away from this flower, there was a two-story wooden building that was less than ten feet high. Because of years of disrepair, the door and window edges had rotted, and most of the eaves had collapsed. Slippery moss grew everywhere on the walls, making it look very dilapidated.On the left side of the door of the wooden building, there was a grayish-white corpse. It was half-leaning against the wall, and its two bony palms were stretched out in front of it, as if it was making a grabbing gesture.The direction of its fingers was the big purple flower.Han Li looked at the corpse for a moment. His eyes suddenly lit up, and a look of surprise flashed across his face.He immediately walked forward quickly, squatted down, and carefully observed the corpse.The clothes of this corpse had long rotted, and everywhere was tattered. It looked like a piece of mud, and a thick layer of soil and dust was attached to the remains.However, through the dust, he could see that there seemed to be a glimmer of light on the bones, which looked quite strange. It seemed that it was most likely a cultivator when it was alive.Han Li stretched out his hand and waved gently. A cool breeze swept past in an instant, directly sweeping away the dust and clothing fragments on the bones, revealing a sparkling snow-white skeleton.\"Clatter\"A soft sound came from the bones. It was a few jade slips and a storage ring that fell.Han Li picked up a jade slip casually. After looking at it for a moment, he raised his hand and stuck it between his eyebrows. His divine sense sank into it.There was nothing else in the jade slip, only a few hundred words:\"If there is a descendant of the Luo family who is fated to enter this realm, don't be surprised.I am your ancestor god Luo Meng. Previously, my incarnation was seriously injured, and I have been in seclusion here for more than nine thousand years \u2026 I originally wanted to cultivate the Flower of Birth and recast the incarnation of the earth, but there are still more than three thousand years before the flower is formed, and I encountered a strong enemy. Although I killed him, I was also seriously injured.A moment later, Han Li suddenly opened his eyes, and he couldn't help but sigh in his heart. This Luo Meng had actually fallen more than a thousand years ago, and the people of his clan still didn't know about it.However, perhaps it was also because of this that there was no news at all. As for the Blue Crystal Race and other hostile forces, although they had long coveted it, they still waited until recent years before they started to attack Wu Meng Island.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li didn't put away the jade slip in his hand. Instead, he placed it next to Roman's remains.Although this former ancestor god of Wu Meng Island was dead, he finally left behind his last words before his death. As for whether it was because there were no Mahayana Stage cultivators in the clan, so he deliberately didn't tell his clansmen as a delaying tactic, it was unknown.However, at the end of his last words, he also mentioned that if there was really a clansman who successfully passed the tribulation in the future, he would use the materials he left behind to refine the Earth God Incarnation. From then on, he would become the new ancestor god of Wu Meng Island and continue to protect the future clansmen.Although the Great Dao was ruthless, this kind of ancestor god who cultivated the Earth Immortal Dao with bloodline and faith as the foundation still had a trace of concern compared to ordinary immortal cultivators. It also had a bit more worldly aura.\"Fellow Roman, although I can't become the new ancestor god of Wu Meng Island, I will naturally protect your clansmen to the best of my ability.Just treat these materials as a reward, \"Han Li said lightly to the remains.After saying that, he retracted his gaze, picked up one of the remaining three jade slips on the ground, and stuck it between his eyebrows.After a while, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but curl up slightly.In this jade slip, it recorded the refining method of the Earth God Incarnation.This method was what he wanted to understand the most at the moment.According to the description, the refining process of the Earth God Incarnation was not only extremely complicated, but the types of materials needed were also very diverse and rare. Among them, the most special and the most indispensable one was a spiritual material called the \"Soul Birth Flower\".When refining the Earth God Incarnation, one must use a complete flower as the raw material, extract the Soul Birth Liquid from it, and add it to other materials to refine successfully.Moreover, the older the flower, the better the refining effect, and the higher the intelligence of the incarnation. However, it had to be at least ten thousand years old, otherwise it couldn't achieve the effect of condensing a soul. If there was this flower that was more than ten thousand years old, the effect of condensing a soul could be said to be almost perfect.At the end of the jade slip, there was a description of the Soulbirth Flower. It said that within a hundred years, the flower would only have leaves but no flowers. After a hundred years, it would bloom with white flowers. After a thousand years, the flower would turn from white to red, and after five thousand years, it would turn from red to purple. After eight thousand years, its color would deepen, and it would grow a cockscomb-shaped stamen. After ten thousand years, a golden pattern would appear on the petals, and after every ten thousand years, another pattern would appear.As for whether there would be any other changes after 100,000 years, perhaps because it was too rare, there was no relevant record in the jade slip.Besides being used to refine an Earthly Spirit Incarnation, this flower was extremely beneficial to the advancement and breakthrough of an Earthly Immortal's bottleneck. However, the process of nurturing it was extremely difficult. It was said that it was extremely rare for it to survive for more than a thousand years. Therefore, not to mention a Birthing Soul Flower that was more than ten thousand years old, even a Birthing Soul Flower that was five thousand years old was extremely rare in the market of the entire Blackwind Sea Region. There was simply no market for it.The purple flower not far away from Han Li was naturally the Birthing Soul Flower. Looking at its shape, it should be at least eight thousand years old. If it flowed into the Blackwind Sea Region, it would absolutely be enough to make an ordinary Earthly Immortal family go bankrupt.As Han Li pondered in his heart, he picked up another jade slip.As a result, the content recorded in this jade slip was a little special. Not only was the language used different from usual, but the meaning was also very obscure and profound.At first, he was a little confused, but when he carefully studied it, he was pleasantly surprised to find that it actually recorded the method of refining the Power of Faith.It included how to take the Power of Faith for one's own use, how to transform it into magic power, and how to condense the Power of Laws.As for the last remaining jade slip, it recorded some of Roman's daily cultivation experiences and some of his insights and analysis of the Ancestral God's cultivation.Han Li only glanced at it briefly and didn't study it carefully. However, some of the contents mentioned in it made him rather concerned.Due to the special geographical location of the Blackwind Sea Region, the area of the sea was far larger than that of the land. Among the Qi of Heaven and Earth that flowed here, the Water Element was naturally the most abundant.Therefore, it was much easier to condense and cultivate the Power of Laws of Water here compared to other Laws. Moreover, due to the geographical advantage, fighting with the Power of Laws of Water here was 30% more powerful than other Laws, and naturally had the upper hand.It was also precisely because of this that it was much easier to find Earthly Immortal books related to the Law of Water here. This also led to the scarcity of all the resources that contained the Power of Laws of Water in the entire Blackwind Sea Region. Once they appeared, they would be snatched crazily.After Han Li put away the last three jade slips, his eyes fell on the storage ring and searched it.As expected, the items in the ring were all the materials mentioned in the jade slip to refine the Water Element Earthly God's incarnation, including the blue crystal used for the statue's head that he saw before.Without hesitation, Han Li put away all the items in the ring. Then, he looked at the Birthing Soul Flower not far away again.After a moment of silence, he took a few steps forward and removed the Sky Bottle from his neck. He pulled out the stopper and carefully dripped a drop of green liquid from the bottle onto the flower.He had condensed this before he left the Spirit Circle. Ever since he came to the Blackwind Sea Region, he had been focused on breaking free from the chains and had never had the chance to use this item. Thus, he had kept this drop of green liquid until now.With this bottle, it was naturally not a problem to accelerate the ripening of this flower to more than ten thousand years old. If time allowed, he even planned to accelerate the ripening of this flower to a hundred thousand years old.After that, he searched the wooden building and the entire forest again. He did not find anything special, so he returned to the secret room through the spatial tunnel.However, the moment he flew out of the tunnel, the tunnel trembled and emitted a large white light. Then, it shrunk rapidly and disappeared without a trace.The white jade slip appeared again. Its surface flashed with spiritual light and floated in mid-air, emitting waves of weak spatial fluctuations.Han Li stretched out his hand and put it into his storage bracelet.This jade slip seemed to be the key to opening the Ancestor God's Secret Realm of Roman Meng.Now that the restriction on this item had been broken by him, it was equivalent to carrying a treasure grotto-heaven with him. It would be much more convenient for him to do whatever he wanted.As Han Li thought about this, he sat down cross-legged in the secret room. He took out the jade slip that recorded the method to refine the Earth Spirit Incarnation and started to comprehend it.Time passed slowly, and the sky gradually darkened. A bright round moon hung in the sky above Wu Meng Island. It was already night time.Han Li, who was sitting cross-legged in the secret room, suddenly stood up. In a flash, he appeared outside the courtyard.He looked up at the huge moon in the sky and reached out to remove the Sky Bottle from his neck. He placed it on the ground.Not long after, rays of white light fell from the sky and gathered on the small bottle. They formed white spots of light, and a huge white halo appeared around the bottle. It was extremely dazzling.When Han Li saw this, his heart skipped a beat.The commotion caused by the Sky Bottle absorbing the moonlight in the Celestial World was much greater than in the Spirit Huan Domain. Previously, as long as there was enough moonlight, it could condense a drop of green liquid in two days. Based on the current situation, could it condense a drop in a day?Han Li thought excitedly and waved his hand to cast a spell.A green light flashed and enveloped the phenomenon around the Sky Bottle.Then, he sat down cross-legged at the side, took out the jade slip from before, and continued to comprehend it.The night passed in the blink of an eye.When Han Li opened his eyes and waved his hand to disperse the green light, he picked up the Sky Bottle and was slightly stunned.The bottle cap could not be opened at all. In other words, there was no green liquid condensed in the bottle.\"Maybe it will still take two days \u2026\"Han Li murmured helplessly. He did not pay too much attention to it and continued to meditate on the spot with his eyes closed.When night fell and the phenomenon appeared again after the small bottle absorbed the moonlight, he cast a spell to cover the phenomenon again.However, when he picked up the Sky Bottle again at dawn, his expression was a little ugly.This was because the small bottle still could not be opened!\"Could it be that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the Immortal Realm is not as dense as the Spirit Huan Realm?\"Just as this absurd thought appeared in Han Li's mind, he immediately rejected it.That night, he placed the Sky Bottle in the small courtyard again. This time, he did not close his eyes to comprehend the jade slip. Instead, he stared at the small bottle without blinking.In the end, there was no change in the small bottle's absorption of the moonlight. However, the next morning, the green liquid still did not appear.As a result, Han Li couldn't help but feel a sense of anxiety welling up in his heart.One should know that the reason why he was able to get to where he was today, other than being careful and cautious, was because of the Sky Bottle. If this bottle lost its ability to condense the green liquid, he would probably lose his greatest support.For example, if he wanted to obtain a ten-thousand-year-old Birthing Soul Flower, it would probably become a very troublesome matter.However, it was still too early to make a conclusion. After all, this was the Realm of True Immortals. It was different from the Spirit Huan Realm and the Spirit Realm.He continued to try, hoping that he would get lucky.On the fourth day, the green liquid still did not appear.On the fifth day, it was still the same.On the sixth day \u2026In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed.At night, the Sky Bottle continued to absorb the white light like before. However, the mysterious green liquid did not show any signs of appearing.Inside the secret chamber, Han Li looked at the Sky Bottle in front of him with a gloomy expression.When he was in the Mortal Dimension all those years ago, it took him at most seven or eight days to condense a drop of green liquid. Now, twice the amount of time had passed, yet the bottle was still empty. This was something that had never occurred in the past, and it caused him to be unable to help but feel slightly taken by surprise.However, after thinking about it for the past few days, he thought of two possibilities.One, it could be because he was in the Realm of True Immortals.According to the words of the Perfected Immortal Ma Liang from the lower realm, this Sky Bottle belonged to a great force in the Realm of True Immortals called the Nine Yuan Temple.Now that the small bottle had returned to the Realm of True Immortals, it was possible that some changes that he could not detect had happened.The second possibility was that during the battle with the Cyclops in the realm gap, this bottle had absorbed the slowing light that contained the power of laws. This might have caused some kind of effect.Han Li exhaled softly, and his expression slowly returned to normal.Although the Sky Bottle was his most important treasure, it did not mean that he could not survive without it.Moreover, the situation that the bottle was in did not mean that it could not produce the green liquid anymore. At the very least, it was still absorbing the white light every night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHan Li put away the Small Bottle temporarily. He planned to let it absorb the power of the moon every night and observe the changes.As for the Birthing Soul Flower needed to refine the Earth God's Incarnation, he would have to think of another way.As he thought of this, he returned to the secret room and stood in front of the wooden table.There was a jade plate on the table, and there was a blue object the size of a head on it. It was the head of the Earth God's Incarnation that was enshrined in the forbidden area of Wu Meng Island.When he went to find Luo Feng a few days ago, he borrowed the head and did some research on it.He took the head out of the jade plate and placed it on the ground. Then, he sat cross-legged on the praying mat and started chanting.A layer of green light appeared on his body and wrapped around the blue head, lifting it into the air.Han Li waved his hands in front of him. His posture was strange, and his movements were simple and unadorned. It was like some uncivilized barbarians worshiping the heavens. He chanted some ancient and obscure incantations.As he moved, a layer of strange blue light appeared on the surface of the head. It flickered with his movements, and the sound of countless people chanting could be heard.Specks of blue light would appear in the surrounding void from time to time, continuously converging into the head.These blue lights were the power of faith that the Earth God's Incarnation gathered from the believers on the entire Wu Meng Island.As the blue light flickered, an indescribable and invisible power spread out from it. It caused ripples that could be seen with the naked eye to appear in the space. Even the secret room and the small courtyard started to shake.Han Li's expression did not change, but his chanting became more hurried.The blue light from the blue head jumped a few times before it slowly stabilized.This power was not to be underestimated. It contained the power of faith that had been accumulated for nearly ten thousand years. Unfortunately, Roman had already died and could no longer control the power that had gathered in the Earth God's Incarnation.He only followed the method recorded in the jade slip and slowly tried to comprehend and feel the power of faith. He wanted to make some preparations for cultivating the Earth God's Incarnation in the future.Right at this moment, Han Li's expression changed, and he gestured in the air with one hand. The restriction light around the secret room suddenly split open a gap, and a white and misty talisman flew in from within.He sucked the talisman into his hand and scanned it with Divine Thought. He immediately stopped what he was doing, put the blue head back on the jade plate on the table, and left the secret room.Outside the courtyard, Luo Feng stood respectfully with his hands by his side.\"Clan Leader Luo, could it be that you have news about a high-grade Earthen Immortal cultivation technique?\" Before the other party could speak, Han Li asked.\"Senior Liu's guess is correct. There is indeed some progress regarding the high-grade Earth Immortal cultivation method.Yesterday, I had a small gathering with some familiar Fellow Daoists and inadvertently heard a piece of news. It's said that a high-grade Earthly Immortal cultivation method will appear in the next auction on Blackwind Island, so I immediately rushed back. \"Luo Feng cupped his hands towards Han Li and said with a face full of joy.\"Thank you, Clan Leader Luo.The next auction is still more than ten years away \u2026 During this period, I'll have to trouble you to continue to find out if there is any news about other high-grade cultivation methods and the Soul Birth Flower. \"Han Li's heart jolted when he heard this, and he nodded his head.\"Yes, Senior Liu, don't worry. I'll give the order right away.\" Luo Feng nodded his head in response and was about to leave.\"Clan Leader Luo, wait a moment.\" Han Li suddenly called out to Luo Feng.\"Senior Liu, is there anything else?\" Luo Feng turned around slightly in a daze.\"Nothing much. It's just that I've troubled you all for my matters these days. Han will remember it in my heart.\"Han Li opened his mouth to speak, but after an undetectable flash of strange light in the depths of his eyes, he said calmly.\"Senior Liu, what are you talking about? This is what we should do.\" Luo Feng was overjoyed and quickly waved his hand.After the two of them chatted for a while, Luo Feng left again.After Han Li watched Luo Feng leave, he turned around and returned to the secret chamber.Just now, he wanted to tell Luo Feng about Roman's corpse in the Secret Realm, but after thinking about it carefully, he felt that it was inappropriate.This matter had a lot of implications, especially the existence of the Soul Birth Flower. If someone with ulterior motives knew about it, it would inevitably cause more trouble. It was better to tell them when the time was right.\u2026Half a month later, in the morning.A bright red morning sun slowly rose from the distant place where the sea and the sky met. The slightly warm sunlight penetrated the morning clouds and reflected on the surface of the sea.The entire Wu Meng Island was shrouded in a layer of warm light. A large number of islanders and cultivators gathered in front of Roman's statues on the island. All of them were carrying out a unified ceremony and praying.The small courtyard in the middle of the island became brighter under the illumination of the sun.At this moment, in the secret chamber of the small courtyard, Han Li, who was adjusting his breath with his eyes closed, slowly opened his eyes. A glimmer of light flashed in his eyes.After this period of comprehension, combined with the study of the head of the Earthly God left behind by Roman, he had some experience on how to condense the power of faith and how to transform it.In other words, if he was able to possess an Earthly God Incarnation of his own and cultivate a suitable high-grade Earthly Immortal Realm cultivation technique, then he would be able to receive and convert the Faith Energy provided by the believers on Wu Meng Island, then he would have a 50% certainty of being able to struggle free of the mysterious chains that restrained his Nascent Soul and recover his cultivation.However, the Sky Bottle still couldn't condense the green liquid. It seemed that he could only pin his hopes on the big auction that would take place more than ten years later for the Soul Birth Flower and the high-level Earth Immortal cultivation method.\"More than ten years is still a little too long \u2026\"Han Li muttered to himself thoughtfully. As usual, he left the secret chamber and came to a certain place in the small courtyard. He bent down and picked up a dark green bottle.However, as soon as the bottle was in his hand, he raised his eyebrows slightly. There was an unusual feeling in his hand, and it seemed to be much heavier than before.He quickly put his hand on the lid and tried to open it.This time, the lid was removed from the bottle effortlessly.He quickly put the bottle in front of his eyes and looked through the mouth of the bottle.As a result, he couldn't help but be overjoyed!At the bottom of the bottle, a dark green liquid the size of a soybean was slowly sliding along the inside of the bottle.The green liquid had condensed again!However, this drop of green liquid in front of him was slightly different from before. Its color seemed to be darker than usual, and it was a little black, reflecting the inside of the bottle into a faint green.Han Li held the small bottle and looked at it repeatedly several times before his mood gradually returned to calmness.Although he had already prepared for the worst, he always kept a trace of luck and hope in the depths of his heart. After all, if this small bottle really lost its effectiveness, it would be a greater blow to him than losing all his magic treasures.Fortunately, it seemed that all of this should be a false alarm. This could really be called a glimmer of hope!However, it had been almost a month since the beginning and the end. Compared to the past, the time it took to condense the green liquid was really a little too long.I wonder what the effect of the green liquid that has condensed for such a long time is?With that thought in mind, Han Li immediately returned to the secret room and activated all the restrictions in one go. Then, with a wave of his hand, he took out the jade token and opened the passage to the secret realm.In the secret realm, everything was the same.The purple Birthing Soul Flower, which was as big as a lotus leaf, still stood alone in the same place. However, Roman's remains had been buried by Han Li next to the wooden hut, and a small grave was built.Han Li came to the front of the big purple flower. Without hesitation, he directly opened the lid of the small bottle and poured the drop of green liquid into the heart of the flower.His eyes stared unblinkingly at the drop of green liquid as it slowly seeped into the stamen of the Birthing Soul Flower. However, he became a little nervous.This feeling was somewhat similar to the feeling he had when he first learned about the effect of the green liquid and carried out his first experiment. There was a sense of eagerness and anticipation.After waiting for a day and a night, Han Li once again entered the secret realm early in the morning and came to the front of the big purple flower.What surprised him was that in just a day, the Birthing Soul Flower had already undergone a shocking change.On all its petals, there was already an additional golden thread that was as thin as gossamer. It coiled around the edge of the petals, and it looked as if there was a thin golden border around the petals.According to the jade token that Roman had left behind, the appearance of a golden pattern on the petals would only appear after it had reached ten thousand years of age.This Birthing Soul Flower was originally eight thousand years old. In that case, the effect of that drop of green liquid should be at least two thousand years old.After coming to this conclusion, Han Li finally revealed a trace of satisfaction on his face.Although from the looks of it, the collection of green liquid had become extremely slow after coming to the Immortal World, the effect of this drop of green liquid was dozens of times better than when he was in the Spirit Huan Domain.After that, he spent another month. After confirming that the Sky Bottle could condense a drop of green liquid after about a month, his heart that was hanging in suspense was finally completely at ease.At the same time, he did not slack off in his research on the method of refining the Earth God Incarnation. From time to time, he would take out the head of the statue and study it carefully.In the blink of an eye, another three months passed.During this period, Han Li would simulate the detailed refining steps of the Earth God Incarnation in his mind almost every day.Now that he had almost completely understood the refining method, he believed that as long as he waited for the Birthing Soul Flower to mature and gathered all the refining materials, he would definitely be able to refine the Earth God Incarnation in one go.Under the accelerated ripening of the green liquid in the small bottle, all the petals of the Birthing Soul Flower also grew a second golden pattern.According to Han Li's estimation, it would take a month to condense this drop of green liquid in the Immortal World. The more accurate effect of the green liquid should be about three thousand years.According to this deduction, as long as everything went smoothly, he would be able to obtain a Birthing Soul Flower that was more than a hundred thousand years old in about three to four years.\u2026 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sun was setting in the west.The golden afterglow made the entire Wu Meng Island look like a golden leaf floating on the surface of the black sea.On the island, smoke was rising from the mortal villages hidden in the forest, and there were more and more ships anchored at the harbor.A few Wu Meng Island cultivators were patrolling around the island, looking at the peace on the island with satisfaction on their faces.In the great battle half a year ago, the Luo Clan had almost been exterminated. The only reason they were able to survive safely was because of the protection of their ancestor.They didn't have any extravagant hopes. They only hoped to be able to peacefully cultivate here and protect the land passed down by their ancestor.\"Huh?\"As they patrolled, the leading cultivator's expression changed. He stopped and looked at the sea in the distance.\"What's wrong?\" When the others saw this, they also stopped.Before they finished speaking, the sea in the distance rumbled and churned. Huge waves that were hundreds of feet tall rose and surged towards Wu Meng Island.It wasn't just the sea in front of them. Huge waves surged from the sea as far as their eyes could see and surged towards them.The ground in the surroundings began to tremble and muffled rumbling sounds could be heard.When they saw this, their expressions changed drastically.The leading cultivator hastily took out a cylindrical object and pulled it. A brilliant ray of light soared into the sky.However, what they didn't know was that the sea in a radius of 50 kilometers around Wu Meng Island seemed to be boiling. Huge waves rose one after another and surged towards the island from all directions.A figure flew out from the main hall of the Luo Clan. It was Luo Feng.His spiritual sense had already covered the sea around the island, and his expression became unsightly.Whoosh! Whoosh! Several figures flew over from all directions and appeared around Luo Feng. They were the other Body Integration Stage elders of the island.They had clearly discovered the abnormality around the island, and their complexions paled.Just at this moment, a huge change occurred!The surging waves suddenly gathered together and condensed into an incomparably huge water screen. It rose from the surroundings of the island and converged towards the center of the island.In the blink of an eye, an incomparably huge transparent water screen appeared and enveloped the entire Wu Meng Island.Luo Feng and the others panicked when they saw this.\"Patriarch, what's going on? Could it be \u2026\" An elder stammered.\"The enemy has come, and this time, the enemy is unprecedentedly powerful!Quickly go and invite Senior Liu! \"Luo Feng's face was ashen as he loudly ordered an elder beside him.Without saying a word, the man immediately flew toward Han Li's residence.\"Pass down the order. Immediately activate all the restrictive spells on the island!\" Luo Feng quickly issued another order.After a few breaths of time, light flickered everywhere around the main hall. One after another, large restrictions were activated, covering all the important places.At this moment, three extremely bright streaks of light flashed in the distant sky, and they flew toward the main hall of the Luo Family at an incredible speed.In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the top of the hall and three figures appeared.The one in the lead was a burly man dressed in white armor with a hollow mask covering half of his face. Two curved fangs protruded from his mouth, making him look quite fierce.Next to the white-armored man was a black-robed old man. His skin was a bit dark, and his eyes shone with a crystalline blue light.The third person was a blue-robed woman who looked to be in her forties. She was still quite attractive, but her nose was a bit sharp and hooked.Strangely, the three of them had dull expressions on their faces and lacked liveliness. They seemed like three exquisitely made puppets.\"You \u2026 you!\"Luo Feng looked at the three through the water screen, and his face suddenly became extremely pale. His body trembled involuntarily, as if he had seen a ghost.The other elders and some of the older cultivators also had the same expression. They looked as if they had seen ghosts, shocked and terrified.Most of the young Luo Family cultivators didn't recognize the three people in the sky, but when they saw the expressions of the patriarch and elders, they knew that these three people had to be extremely powerful. Their expressions also became uneasy.\"Ancestral God Han Qiu \u2026 Ancestral God Lu Kun \u2026 Ancestral God Hulu!\"Luo Feng let out a long sigh and said slowly, as if he wanted to spit out the terror in his heart.When the young Luo Family cultivators heard this, their faces instantly turned deathly pale.Lu Kun and Hungu were two Elder Gods from two islands that were quite far away from Wumeng Island. They didn't have many interactions, but Elder God Hanqiu was an Elder God of the Glacial Crystal Race who had invaded Wumeng Island not long ago. He had been a sworn enemy of the Luo Family of Wumeng Island for tens of thousands of years.Elder God Hanqiu and the other two were separated by over three hundred meters. They looked down at the trembling cultivators of Wumeng Island, and their rather lifeless eyes became even colder.\"Fellow Daoist Hanqiu, are you certain that Roman has already perished?I heard that your Blue Crystal Race suffered heavy losses a few days ago. \"A cold light flashed through the black-robed elder's eyes, and his voice carried a hint of doubt.The white-armored man snorted coldly and slowly said, \"Hmph, if Roman was still alive, why hasn't he shown himself in the past ten thousand years?As for the setback our race suffered a few days ago, it's because another immortal has arrived on Wu Meng Island recently, \"the white-armored man harrumphed coldly as he explained.\"What?Fellow Daoist Han Qiu, you didn't mention this to us before!Could it be that you're trying to deceive us? \"The blue-robed woman asked with a hint of anger.The black-robed elder frowned and looked at the white-armored man with dissatisfaction.\"Don't be impatient, the two of you. I've already investigated that person. He's only a lower realm cultivator who just ascended. I don't know how he came here, but there's no need to worry about him.Come to think of it, if Wumeng Island didn't have anyone guarding it right now, why would I invite you two? \"Han Qiu said with a calm expression.\"A lower realm cultivator who just ascended...\" The blue-robed woman's expression eased slightly when she heard this, but there was still a hint of hesitation in her voice.The black-robed elder raised an eyebrow and revealed a contemplative expression. He also didn't immediately express his stance.\"How about this? After this is done, I'm willing to give each of you a Meridian Clear Spirit Pill in addition to the rewards we agreed on earlier. It can be considered as compensation for what I didn't say beforehand. Are you two satisfied now?\" Han Qiu said with a smile.The black-robed man laughed, \"Haha, since Fellow Han is so sincere, Fellow Huanggu and I naturally won't be suspicious.\"The blue-robed woman nodded slowly.\"You two are right. He's only a small cultivator who just ascended. How can he stop the three of us together?\" Han Qiu said with a laugh.\"Since that's the case, let's make our move.\" The black-robed man said and took the lead.With a wave of his hand, the sea below suddenly rumbled and dozens of incomparably huge water pillars rose up. Each pillar was over a hundred meters thick and connected the sky to the earth.These pillars of water suddenly intertwined and fused together to form a giant hand that was several thousand feet tall. Then, it smashed down towards Luo Feng and the others with an earth-shattering force.Before the giant hand had even arrived, a gust of fierce winds had already swept forth, and all of the restrictions and barriers tremored violently, almost being torn apart by the fierce winds. Several of the restrictions even shattered into specks of light amid a dull thump.The expressions of Luo Feng and the others changed greatly. They wanted to dodge, but it was too late. They were about to be crushed by the giant hand.At this moment, a long whistle came from afar. In the blink of an eye, it was near them. It was a green light that shot over like lightning and appeared in front of Luo Feng and the others in a flash.The cyan figure punched the void.An invisible force tore through the void and produced a shocking whistle. Everywhere it passed, ripples that could be seen with the naked eye appeared and collided with the giant hand.\"Boom!\" An earth-shattering sound rang out.The giant hand was shattered by the fist energy and exploded, turning into water droplets that splashed in all directions.A wave of air spread out in all directions like a wave. Everywhere it passed, a hurricane was set off. Whether it was rocks or trees, they were either swept away by the wind or shattered into powder.Fortunately, there were no mortals nearby, so there weren't many casualties.The green light around the green figure in the air dissipated and Han Li's figure appeared.The expressions of Han Qiu and the others changed.\"Lord Ancestor God!\" The people of Wu Meng Island were overjoyed and cheered as if they had just survived a disaster.Luo Feng also heaved a sigh of relief. But soon after, a worried expression appeared on his face.Although Han Li was powerful, the other party had three Ancestor Gods!Han Li retracted his arm and swept his gaze across the three people in the air. He asked in a deep voice, \"Who are you three? What business do you have with my Wu Meng Island?\"\"Senior Liu, these three are the Ancestor Gods of the nearby islands.The white-armored man in the middle is the Ancestor God of the Icy Crystal Race, Han Qiu. The black-robed old man next to him is Ancestor Lu Kun. That middle-aged woman is called Madam Swan Bone. \"Luo Feng flew to Han Li's side and transmitted his voice.Han Li's heart stirred when he heard this, but his expression didn't change in the slightest.\"Fellow Daoist Han Qiu, it seems different from what you said. This person is actually a Profound Immortal. He isn't a weakling like you said, right?\" Lu Kun's eyes revealed a trace of coldness as he looked at Han Qiu and transmitted his voice.Madam Swan Bone's expression was somewhat unsightly.\"As far as I know, this person has ascended for less than a year. Even if he is a Profound Immortal, the magic power in his body certainly hasn't completely transformed into Immortal Spiritual Force. There is nothing to fear!\" Han Qiu was very calm and transmitted his voice with a smile.When Ancestor Lu Kun and Madam Swan Bone heard this, they looked at each other and didn't say anything.\"You must be Fellow Daoist Liu. I don't need to say anything to guess the purpose of our visit.Wu Meng Island and our three clans are enemies. Today, the three of us came here to destroy the Luo Clan. This matter has nothing to do with you. Fellow Daoist better not get involved in this mess and leave immediately.I can let bygones be bygones about the matter of you killing several clansmen of my clan a few days ago. \"Han Qiu's eyes emitted a cold light as he spoke in a deep voice.When Luo Feng heard this, his heart thumped, and he looked at Han Li with some apprehension.The expressions of the surrounding Luo Clan members also changed greatly. The older clansmen were shocked by the situation in front of them, while the younger clansmen were shocked by Han Qiu's words.When Han Qiu addressed the Ancestor God as Fellow Daoist Liu, the younger clansmen of the Luo Clan couldn't help but recall a rumor that had been secretly circulating in the clan. The current Ancestor God wasn't Luo Meng, but someone else.The elders of the clan had always strictly denied this rumor and forbade the clansmen from talking about it. But now, it seemed that this rumor was very likely to be true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"You want us to retreat?A boy who has just ascended to the lower realm is too arrogant! \"When Han Qiu heard Han Li's words, his face suddenly sank. A white light flashed around him, and his finger pointed forward. A cloud of white mist appeared out of thin air in front of him.The mist rolled slightly, intertwining with each other in the middle.With a harsh sound, a white icicle dozens of feet long appeared. Its whole body flashed with white light, and with a blur, it turned into two, two into four, four into eight \u2026In the blink of an eye, countless white icicles appeared, almost covering half of the sky, and went straight for Han Li.An extremely cold Qi was emitted from the icicles that filled the sky, and the surrounding temperature suddenly dropped to the extreme. Many icicles even condensed in the void, sparkling and translucent, as if they wanted to freeze the entire world.Almost at the same time as Han Qiu made his move, Ancestor Lu Kun and Madam Huanggu also made their moves.Ancestor Lu Kun was wrapped in a layer of blue light. He stretched out his hand, and a little crystal blue light appeared in his palm. With a few whooshing sounds, it sank into the sea below.Boom!The sea suddenly tumbled, and a huge whirlpool appeared, and it continued to expand. There was a loud noise like thousands of horses galloping, and blue light flashed vaguely.Madam Huanggu closed her eyes slightly, and her hands formed a sign. A black light flashed on the surface of her body, and a wisp of black mist rose from the surface of her body, disappearing into a cloud above.The white cloud instantly became as black as ink, and it began to churn incessantly. An indescribable ripple spread out from it, causing the dense water vapor within a radius of five hundred kilometers to gather towards it, causing it to rapidly expand.At that moment, Han Li saw that the situation was far from good. Azure light swirled around his body as he soared into the sky. Facing the onslaught of ice spikes, he pounced towards Han Qiu and the others.But seeing a flash of light in his eyes, seven stars appeared on his chest and abdomen, and there was a crackling sound in his body. His body suddenly swelled by three times, and he punched the void.A terrifying and enormous force surged out, causing the entire space to tremble violently before suddenly exploding apart.Countless white ripples that were visible to the naked eye appeared layer by layer and spread out with his fist as the center.The blue icicles that filled the sky collided with the white ripples and immediately produced a series of crackling sounds. They all exploded and turned into countless tiny ice crystals that splashed in all directions.Seeing this, Han Qiu's expression didn't change in the slightest. His hands quickly formed seals and shot out several seals.The fine ice crystals exploded again with a bang, turning into countless white cold mist. As the mist rolled down, it instantly shrouded a radius of several hundred meters around Han Li. A strong fluctuation of law rippled out from it.Han Li could only feel that his surroundings were filled with white mist. He waved his sleeves and immediately set off a gust of wind that swept across the surroundings.However, aside from tumbling erratically, the white mist showed no signs of dissipating.Han Li didn't pay any more attention to the mist. His figure didn't stop as he directly rushed into the white mist.The surrounding mist was like a living thing, immediately entangling his body. But for him, this degree of extreme cold was not enough to scare him.With a \"whoosh\", Han Li flew out of the white mist in the blink of an eye. His body shone with blue light and he raised his arm, about to give Han Qiu and the other two a thunderous blow.But then his face changed. There was nothing in front of him, and the figures of Han Qiu and the other two seemed to have disappeared without a trace.His body swayed as he stood still and looked around. His pupils suddenly shrank.He saw that a few hundred meters away, Han Qiu and the other two were standing there.Han Li's eyes swept around, and his eyes suddenly flashed a trace of understanding.It wasn't that Han Qiu and the other two suddenly changed their position. Instead, when he passed through the white mist, his five senses were unknowingly disturbed. Thus, he changed his direction and flew out from the other side of the white mist.Then, he frowned and looked down. He saw that his legs, lower abdomen, and other parts of his body were entangled by white mist as thin as hair. A strange chill penetrated through the mist and invaded his body. He only felt that his whole body was gradually becoming numb. This kind of feeling, it was as if he was really frozen.Han Li shouted almost without thinking. The seven stars on his chest and abdomen suddenly lit up, and his body was suddenly covered by a translucent membrane. Suddenly, the strange white mist was isolated outside, unable to approach him.All of this took a long time to describe, but in fact, it happened in an instant.But before he could do anything else, there was a \"hua la\" sound, and a huge monster suddenly flew out from the whirlpool below.Impressively, it was a blue giant dozens of meters tall. Its whole body seemed to be composed of seawater. It looked quite ugly, with a big head and a small body. Its hands and feet were also of different thickness and length, as if it was casually molded out of dough.The blue water giant rose into the air, and its huge body blocked in front of Han Li. A blue palm the size of a house slapped toward Han Li.Before the giant hand arrived, a turbulent hurricane whistled over, and wherever it passed, the air was distorted. The momentum was so great that even Han Li's body was blown away.Han Li swayed and stabilized his body. He clenched one hand into a fist, and without dodging, punched out fiercely.An invisible force flew out, and the void made an ear-piercing explosion, twisting endlessly.Countless white ripples appeared once again before converging to form a massive white fist projection, which struck the blue water giant's body first despite being the first to do so.A scene that caused Han Li to be astonished appeared!Circles of waves immediately appeared on the giant's body where it was hit, forming a whirlpool.The white shadow fist flashed into the whirlpool, and in the next moment, it flew out from the other side of the giant's body. It continued to fly forward and bombarded the void, causing a burst of crackling sounds to resound in the void.The whirlpool on its body healed in the blink of an eye, and it seemed to be completely undamaged.At this moment, the blue giant palm had already swung in front of Han Li.\"Peng!\"It was too late for Han Li to dodge. His body seemed to be hit by a meteorite, and he was sent flying, rolling far away.But he stabilized his body in a moment. Although his face was a little pale, he didn't suffer any injury.However, the blue water giant rushed toward him again.\"Fellow Lu Kun, I didn't expect that after a mere 20,000 years, the Formless Water Ghost you condensed with the Law of Soft Water has become more and more exquisite. It just happens to be the nemesis of this Xuan Immortal's brute force.\" In midair, Han Qiu chuckled.\"Fellow Lu Kun, you flatter me. Your Law of Ice is not bad. It seems that you have touched the threshold of the Void Domain.\" Ancestor Lu Kun said humbly, but he couldn't help but reveal a little complacency on his face.\"Hehe, it's just a little bit, far from the Void Domain.Next, it's up to Fellow Huanggu to show off his power. \"Han Qiu looked up at the sky and grinned.Just a moment when Han Li was entangled by the two of them, the dark cloud in midair had grown to dozens of miles in size, and silver snake-like lightning was darting about in the cloud.At this moment, Madam Huanggu waved her hand with a solemn expression and struck out a spell. Lightning flashed in the dark cloud, and the entire cloud rolled violently!Whoosh!Countless densely packed raindrops fell from the sky, and it actually became a downpour.The raindrops were incomparably dense, and strangely connected with each other, forming strands of rain that covered the sky and covered the earth.Han Li had just dodged the blue water giant's punch, and he took the opportunity to look up at the sky. He frowned.Strands of rain fell from the sky, and the moment they touched his body, they immediately wrapped around him like thin ropes.In the blink of an eye, his body was entangled by hundreds of strands of rain.Han Li waved his arms with all his might, and the True Polarity Membrane on the surface of his body flowed with silver light, breaking the strands of rain on his body and producing muffled bangs that were almost inaudible.These strands of rain were surprisingly very flexible. Dozens or hundreds of strands of rain were nothing to him, but if he was trapped by thousands or tens of thousands of strands of rain, the consequences would be unthinkable!Han Li's expression instantly became extremely unsightly. His body shone with a green light, and he shot out of the range of the dark cloud.A blue shadow flashed, and the blue water giant blocked in front of Han Li, its two large hands suddenly slapping down.Han Li punched the air with both fists.Two rumbling sounds!Two invisible huge forces drew two white marks in the air, hitting the giant's palms.The giant's palms flashed with blue light, and the two huge forces passed through, not causing the slightest bit of damage to it.Whoosh whoosh!The two giant palms did not stop at all, continuing to slap down towards Han Li.\"Damn it!\"Han Li let loose an enraged roar and his body swayed as he sidestepped to the side.In just a few short breaths, his body was once again entangled by hundreds of strands of rain, causing his movements to become much slower, but he was still able to barely avoid the giant palms.The blue water giant opened its mouth, and a dozen or so millstone-sized blue water balls shot out, dazzling blue light flickering inside, emitting violent energy fluctuations, heading straight for Han Li.At the same time, its body turned, and once again pounced like lightning.Han Li was firmly entangled by this water giant that could not be defeated, and did not have the spare time to break free from the strands of rain on his body. The more strands of rain wrapped around his body, the more difficult it was to move.But at this time, if one were to carefully observe, the light on the bodies of Han Qiu and the other two was much dimmer than before, especially Henggu and Lu Kun.After a few breaths, a crystal blue cocoon appeared in midair, and one could vaguely see the figure of Han Li inside, almost unable to move.The blue water giant also stopped its attack at this moment, and just floated motionlessly next to the blue cocoon.\"You two Fellow Daoists have worked hard, look at this Han!\"Han Qiu's eyes flashed with joy, and with a low shout, countless white runes emerged from the white light on the surface of his body, exuding an incomparably strong fluctuation of Laws, and integrated into the white mist.At the same time, the white light on the surface of his body rapidly dimmed at a speed visible to the naked eye.The white mist immediately roiled, rolling and tumbling towards the distant Han Li, submerging Han Li and the surrounding cocoon, forming a huge white ball of smoke.A strong fluctuation of Laws filled with an extremely cold intent flashed inside.Ka ka!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
