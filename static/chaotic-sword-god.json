No matter where one looked, there was no way to climb up these mountains.At the very top of these peaks, there was only less than a hundred meters between one peak to the next. There was a faint amount of fog that hampered the visibility of the area to a confusing degree. However, despite the hazy visibility, one would still be able to faintly make out two people standing at the very top of the mountain peaks calmly and motionlessly as if they were stone statues. Only their clothes and wind had fluttered with the fierce gale of wind that blew across the sky.Between these two people, one of them was a youth that was no older than 20 years old. This youth was incredibly handsome with a flawless facial appearances. It could be said that his appearances was simply unrivaled throughout the world and was a natural lady killer. His rather ordinary-looking eyes contained a unique amount attractiveness and fascination to them and seemed as if it could steal the soul of whomever.The youth had long black hair with a length that reached his waist without being tied up in any way, allowing it to float freely in the fierce wind as if it was dancing. On his back was a single long sword that was wrapped up in a thick white layer of cloth. On the exquisite sword hilt that stuck out from the cloth, one could make out the two words \u201cLight Wind\u201d. What was most puzzling about the sword however was the fact that there had been no ropes binding it to the youth at all. It seemed as if it was stuck to the back of the youth without any chance of falling\u2013clearly a very hard display to explain.This youth\u2019s name was Jian Chen, the number one expert with a name that shook the Heavens and the Jianghu with the moniker of \u201cSword God\u201d. His quick sword techniques had long since reached perfection and could be considered the sword master of the generation. Despite being only 20 or so years old, he had already reached a realm of great heights.The details regarding Jian Chen were relatively unknown to the people of the Jianghu. Aside from that he was an orphan with no affiliations to any school or sect, there was nothing else known about him. His history was essentially a riddle, and the strong style of martial arts and the exquisite sword style he used had been an utter mystery on where to learn it.And on the other sword-shaped peak a hundred meters away was a single large man wearing black robes. This was an elderly man who looked to be around 50 to 60 years old with hair that was tied up in the same fashion of the neck of a crane. Both of his elderly eyes lit up with a lively spirit that seemed to shine with a light that lit up the entire area. His gaze had been like a sharp sword that would make anyone unwilling to look straight at him. In his hand was a black and thick long sword. But what was most surprising was that this giant sword had no edge to it.This elderly man was the legendary figure that had disappeared from the Jianghu over a hundred years ago: Dugu Qiubai. But that was only a nickname of his since no one had any idea on what his true name or identity was. The reason for this was because over a hundred years ago, he had defeated every single \u2018unparalleled\u2019 super-experts. Nowadays, the amount of people that knew anything about Dugu Qiubai and were still alive were far and few. But even now, the splendid light he had cast in his former days had been passed on from generation to generation. A hundred years later, his strength was surely much stronger than before; meaning that there was no one that knew just how strong Dugu Qiubai had become.Silently, Dugu Qiubai stared at the 20 or so years old Jian Chen from a hundred meters away. His eyes were extremely terrifying and seemed to contain a sharp sword-like glare that seemed as if it could freeze someone at times.\u201cJian Chen, despite being so young, you have a strength that is no weaker than mine. Your achievements in the way of the sword is something that even I can only hope to attain. But unfortunately, you\u2019ve killed my one dear disciple, leaving me no choice but to take revenge. No matter what, I will act in place of my disciple for the sake of justice today.\u201d Dugu Qiubai\u2019s spoke darkly. His previously calm voice had already started to fill up with a bloodlust that would cause people to tremble and shake.But Jian Chen\u2019s face remained calm as ever as he stared back at Dugu Qiubai impassively. His white robes fluttered gently into the air while the hair that dangled at his waist was sent dancing in the wind freely.\u201cI cannot be blamed for that. It was your disciple that decided to offend me first. It could only be blamed on his lack of skill that he was killed by my own sword.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s lips opened and closed gently as the words came flowing out from his mouth.Laughing angrily, Dugu Qiubai spoke, \u201cA lack of skill? Very well then! Then today I will see just how experienced you are. Let this old man see where you will be able to execute me with your Light Wind Sword.\u201dAs he spoke, Dugu Qiubai waved his Heavy Iron Sword. Immediately, a strong amount of Sword Qi began to escape the sword before shooting straight for Jian Chen a hundred meters away with the speed of a lightning bolt.Unsheathing his sword with an impassive face, Jian Chen quickly drew out the long sword that had been on his back to his hand. This double-edged sword was about 1.3 meters long and two fingers wide with a white light. Stabbing forward with the sword, an even more fierce amount of Sword Qi appeared from the sword and shot towards the jet of Sword Qi from Dugu Qiubai with a speed almost impossible to see with the naked eye.\u201cBang!\u201dThe two rays of Sword Qi collided with a loud explosion that rocked the eardrums. A large wave of Qi scattered away from the epicenter with great speeds, scattering the lingering wisp of mist and clouds nearby.Straight away, Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai flew straight for each other, leaving the twin peaks they had initially been standing on. As they reached the midway point of the two peaks, they began to engage each in a fierce battle midair.The two men had strikes that were impeccably fast and the sounds made from their weapons striking against each other had been an endless stream of metallic rings. A sharp amount of Sword Qi shot out from all directions from the two and left giant holes in the landscape around them. As a result, countless of rocks had been sent cascading down a thousand meters below.Within several breaths worth of time, Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai had already exchanged several hundred blows at lightning quick speeds. Afterwards, the two men had leapt back to their respective mountain peaks. Each person were in a worse-for-wear state and had more than enough tears in their previously perfect clothing.With a serious expression that seemed to grow even more grim each second, Dugu Qiubai growled, \u201cWhat a fast sword, it is no wonder that no one in the Jianghu is able to break past your sword. But, it is powerless against this old man.\u201d Dugu Qiubai paused for a moment before continuing to say, \u201cIf we continue on like this, the victor of this match will be hard to determine. We may as well use our strongest strike to find out the victor.\u201d With that, Dugu Qiubai suddenly exploded with power that seemed as if it was a single giant sword that pierced into the skies.Growing serious as well, Jian Chen too began to spike with a large amount of power that was by no means weaker than Dugu Qiubai.The power of the two men continued to escalate with an earth-shattering amount of force that filled the entire area. Soon enough, the power of the two began to cover the both of them and all over the entire mountains. Even the clouds themselves had a hole in them from the power exuded by the two. A fierce gale began to scream and whistle with an ear-piercing sound that was reminiscent of a ghost wailing into the winds. Down in the forests below, countless of animals began to let out terrified sounds as they began to scuttle away from the area as far as their limbs could take them. The strength of the two men on the peaks continued to escalate as they prepared to unleash their strongest strike.\u201cKacha!\u201d \u201cKacha!\u201dNot too far away in the mountains, several small trees were unable to withstand the power of the two. Snapping and breaking into several pieces, they were sent flying into the air and far away from the place.While Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai\u2019s strength continued to rise, a stream of Qi began to stream around them in a single revolution. Any trees or pieces of grass in the area had been pressed down against the ground in the face of their might, and several of the larger trees had even began to shake back and forth.At the same time, a dazzling glow of white light appeared in Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword while a jet-black light appeared in Dugu Qiubai\u2019s Heavy Iron Sword.The Qi circulating around the two men began to grow stronger and stronger until there was a rich white glow that surrounded Jian Chen completely, and a deep black glow that surrounded Dugu Qiubai inside. The both of them had disappeared into their respective colors while all that was left to see was two balls of light shining with the exact opposite colors of each other.\u201cYin!\u201dJian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword had already been filled with a resplendent glow and had started to shake with a powerful Sword Qi that would cause anyone to feel frightened. His black hair had fluttered crazily in the winds while the white robe he wore fluttered with it. His entire body floated in midair, and a single look was all it took for him to be identified as a war god with an indomitable strength.As the two men\u2019s strength continued to climb up to the peak, the two men suddenly let out a furious roar that shook the heavens like a bolt of lightning and pierced the ear drums. Straight away, a beautiful bright white light and a dark black light shot towards each other with incredible speed. In the instant where the two would collide against each other\u2026There had been no sound as one would expect. When everything had calmed down, one could see that Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai had changed spots. Each one were now on the other mountain peak away from each other with an equally pal face. A steady stream of blood could be seen flowing from Jian Chen\u2019s chest, staining his pure white robes instantly. In that split-instance where the two sides had crossed paths, Dugu Qiubai\u2019s sword had pierced through Jian Chen\u2019s heart.As for Dugu Qiubai, he had lost his entire right arm, meaning that he would not be able to wield a sword any longer. The Heavy Iron Sword that had been in it had long since dropped down a thousand meters into the cliffs below. At the time where he had pierced Jian Chen\u2019s heart, he had lost his right arm in exchange.Standing silently on top of the mountain peak, a stream of fresh blood began to slowly leak from his mouth. His white face continued to grow paler and paler before it became as pale as paper. His heart had been pierced by Dugu Qiubai\u2019s sword, meaning that he was doomed to be stuck in an impasse where death was inevitable.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Dugu Qiubai began to laugh from the mountain peak he was standing on. \u201cJian Chen, with your talent, you would most likely be able to defeat me given several years. But how unfortunate it is for you that your strength is lacking from mine. In the end, you were still defeated by my hand.\u201d As he spoke, Dugu Qiubai sighed shortly. \u201cAi\u2026for an old man like me to see to the funeral of a genius, what a sorrowful matter. But however, I must do what I must to avenge my disciple.\u201dSensing that he was slowly being cut away from the power of life, Jian Chen began to close his eyes. At that moment, he was at peace with himself. Death to him was no important manner. After all, after traveling so many years in the Jianghu, Jian Chen had killed many men and death had long since dulled his emotions. The only emotion he had felt in his heart was that he would have no more chances to explore the pinnacle of the way of the sword.Just as Jian Chen submitted himself to a realm of calm, a sudden but strange feeling appeared within Jian Chen\u2019s mind. In that crucial moment, Jian Chen\u2019s spirit seemed to have harmonized with his long sword. He was the sword, and the sword was him; there had been no difference between the two of them. It was almost as if the sword had already became a part of his soul.At the same time, a powerful and pure amount of world energy began to descend from the skies before flowing into his mind one stream after another. As it entered, it began to perfectly harmonize with his soul, and as the energy of the world continued to pour into him, Jian Chen could distinctly feel that his own \u201cspirit\u201d began to grow at an accelerated rate. Simultaneously, his soul began to leave his body and into the boundless mountains and fields ahead. At this very moment, everything within five thousand meters could be distinctly seen in Jian Chen\u2019s mind. He could even see a single mosquito on the ground living as it pleased without a problem.At the verge of his death, he had somehow managed to breakthrough\u2026.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2: Changyang Xiang TianSuddenly, the sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hand started to control itself; it was as if the longsword had a mind of its own. Unexpectedly, the sword shot toward Dugu Qiubai like a bolt of lighting, traveling at a very high speed.The speed of the longsword was almost inconceivable. Dugu Qiubai only reacted when the sword had reached his throat. The sword was infused with an extraordinarily fierce sword qi. Dugu Qiubai widened his eyes in fear just as the longsword pierced through his neck. After finishing the strike, mist appeared from the hilt of the sword. The mist swirled around in midair momentarily before the sword returned to Jian Chen\u2019s hand.A fist-sized hole slowly appeared in the middle of Dugu Qiubai\u2019s throat. The sword tip had expanded as it pierced through Dugu Qiubai\u2019s neck, enlarging the wound. If not for that, it would have been impossible for a sword that thin to create a wound of that size.Dugu Qiubai\u2019s eyes were wide open as he stared at the sword, not believing what he saw. After all, he had just witnessed an impossible feat. He slowly opened his mouth to say something, but unfortunately, his throat had already been impaled, rendering him speechless. With a final look of disbelief and terror, he slowly crumpled to the floor, never to stand again.Jian Chen clasped his sword silently before looking at the collapsed Dugu Qiubai; a gasp was threatening to escape from his own mouth. He didn\u2019t think that in this final hour of life he would make a breakthrough into the realm of the Sword God. But however it was for naught, as he himself was close to death as well.Inwardly sighing, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes slowly began to dim. Even though the breakthrough empowered his body, it was very hard to escape death, especially when one\u2019s innards are skewered.Soon after, Jian Chen followed Dugu Qiubai\u2019s footsteps into the afterlife, his body falling to the ground, proceeding into the abyss.After Jian Chen had fallen, the area in which he and Dugu Qiubai had fallen started to shake. So much so, that the two sword-like mountain peaks emitted a loud sound that shook the heavens and split the two mountains in half. Countless boulders and stones tumbled down the mountainside, creating an avalanche in all directions. The sky turned purple and green and the heavens and earth were illuminated. The colors danced and mixed to form a beautiful picture, and it was a shame that neither Jian Chen nor Dugu Qiubai were alive to see it, or the series of events which would follow afterwards\u2026\u2026\u2026Inside a spacious and luxurious mansion, was a room decorated with great splendor. Outside this room, a large group of people had gathered. A young male paced relentlessly in front of the doors, his face was filled with anxiety and worry. He looked to be thirty years of age, and he gave off a majestic aura. Although he had aged a little, one could still see the handsome youth that he once was. He was wearing a gold lined silver chang pao, which added to his handsome appearance, and he was surrounded by an aura similar to that of a host. His face was resolute, even his eyebrows were knitted together, almost forming a single lump.Three meters outside of the room, a group of 30 people, ranging from young to old, were all lined up nervously. The elders of the group looked to be 60 to 70 years old already, with white hair all over their wrinkled faces. However, despite their age, their eyes could still make people shiver and quake in fear from the godly lights that flickered within. Judging by the glow from their eyes, the amount of fear they could inflict on others was so much that people wouldn\u2019t take them to be frail old men at all, but rather robust and healthy middle aged men with the strengths of a tiger and dragon combined. The rest of the men were all around 30 to 40 years old, with imposing auras and eyes that revealed nothing. It was obvious with only one glance that this was not a group of normal people.And within the room in front of them, the sounds of a woman crying in pain could be heard.\u201cMadam, keep on pushing, the baby is almost out. I repeat, the baby is almost out\u2026\u201d An elderly but impatient voice could be heard through the pain-filled echoes. Those who could hear the voice could tell the owner of the voice was an elderly woman.Outside the room, the middle aged man who was anxiously pacing about, abruptly froze in place and spoke with a sense of urgency, \u201cAi\u2026this has been going on for an entire day and night already, how has Yun\u2019er not given birth? If this drags on for any longer, I\u2019m afraid even Yun\u2019er will face an unfavorable situation.\u201d Even the man\u2019s voice was filled with never ending anxiety.\u201cMy lord, please don\u2019t worry too much. Madam Yun\u2019er will definitely be fine. You forget that Madam Yun\u2019er is a bright Saint Master.\u201d A white haired elder spoke with a tone of confidence, but even his face could not hide the look of worry on it.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d The lord clad in a white chang pao began to sigh again repeatedly; the worry and anxiety on his face did not decrease even the slightest amount.Eventually, after the men outside had waited for two more hours, an excited voice came from within the room. \u201cMy lord, my lord! Madam Yun\u2019er has given birth! She has given birth and is safe! And so is the boy!\u201d The amount of emotion in the voice was stirring up excitement throughout the house.Upon hearing that, the middle age man that was waiting anxiously became slack-jawed; the wariness in his face had been completely wiped out and replaced with an expression of joy and emotions. He was so emotionally moved that he couldn\u2019t find the right words to say, and blew open the doors so quickly that it was as if they didn\u2019t exist in the first place. His speed was almost inconceivable; no ordinary man could possess enough strength to pull off the same amount of speed he had just displayed.The middle aged man immediately flashed over to the bedside and sat down beside it. His face was full of concern as he looked at the woman who was reclining on top of it. \u201cYun\u2019er, how are you feeling; you have to be all right!\u201d Despite his excitement, his voice was gentle and was brimming with concern.On top of the bed was a woman who was in the peak of her 20\u2019s. Her appearance was so beautiful, it could cause an entire state to fight and collapse upon itself for her hand. Her exhausted and pale face was drenched in sweat, but still managed to retain a divine look.The female looked up with a tired expression at the man by her side and smiled, \u201cMy dear husband, I am fine. Please just allow me to see my baby.\u201d\u201cOh! Yes! Right away! As long as Yun\u2019er is fine.\u201d The man started to smile with joy, but he turned around and looked at the bundled up child in the midwife\u2019s arms. Right as he was about to speak, the eyebrows on the midwife knitted together and stared with rapt attention at the infant she was holding. Her arms continued to rock the bundle as she muttered, \u201cCry baby, go on and cry. What child are you that you do not cry? How odd, I have delivered many babies, and although the numbers have not reached over a thousand babies, I have helped given birth to over 900. However, this is the first time I have seen a freshly delivered baby that does not cry.\u201dBut at the same time she spoke, the men who were outside all piled into the room, each one of them had a smile on their faces. One after another each person began to congratulate the woman on the bed.The middle aged man was still smiling greatly and spoke to the woman, \u201cYun\u2019er, you should rest up first. I\u2019ll bring the child over in a second.\u201d The man then got up and walked towards the midwife, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Could it be there\u2019s some sort of problem with the child?\u201d His voice had dropped down slightly; sometimes, some children would be born with diseases. This occurrence wasn\u2019t uncommon, and would actually happen often. He was already afraid that his newly born child had some sort of problem.Hearing his question, the midwife\u2019s face went sour as she looked at him, and said respectfully, \u201cMy lord, the young lord has no problems that I am aware of, but according to my 10 years of experience, every newborn child will start to cry. But this young lord is different; look here, ever since his birth, he hasn\u2019t uttered even a single peep of sound. This is an extremely strange situation.\u201dThe man\u2019s forehead creased in thought as he looked at the bundled infant. The infant\u2019s eyes were bright and showed no impurities within them as it looked all over the place. One moment he would look over here, and the next moment he would look over there. He was very cute in this way, and just by looking at him you would think there were no problems with him.However, the man didn\u2019t notice that the infant\u2019s bright eyes didn\u2019t have a single impurity in the vast abyss of his pupils. In fact, it had seemed like his eyes held a profoundness that shook the man\u2019s inner self, though he himself didn\u2019t believe it.Then as he put his hand on top of the infant, he saw a fine layer of yellow light suddenly float around his palm.Seeing the middle aged man\u2019s movement, the midwife\u2019s face became uneasy. She was only a small midwife, one of society\u2019s lowest class, but even she was afraid if there was a problem with the child. If there was one, then the man would blame her, and she would not be able to recover from it. Despite the fact that this situation was not related to her in anyway, she wouldn\u2019t have the power to say otherwise.The man quickly took his hand back, his own heart was finally at ease. A smile returned to his face once more as he laughed, \u201cThe child is safe and sound, I can\u2019t find even a single problem.\u201d He took the bundle from the midwife with another laugh.Upon hearing this, the midwife let out a breath of air in relief. With her heart rate slowly going back to normal, even she started to laugh in excitement, \u201cWhat the lord says is correct, perhaps this is a representation of the young lord\u2019s future. He will surely become a strong and unique individual as he grows.\u201dAs he listened to the midwife, knowing that this was an extraordinarily vague thing to say, he still couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cYes yes yes, I can only hope so. Someone come here! Let us reward Mother Hong with a hundred gold coins!\u201dThe midwife\u2019s face grew joyously and immediately said with emotion, \u201cI give the lord many thanks, many many thanks indeed!\u201dThe father brought the infant to his mother on the bed and smiled, \u201cYun\u2019er, look! This is our child, look how cute he is!\u201dYun\u2019er held onto the child tenderly and gave him a kiss on the forehead and spoke happily, \u201cDear husband, since our child is a boy, then as per our agreement beforehand, we shall call him Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dLaughing, the husband said, \u201cNot bad, I hereby officially declare that this child\u2019s name will be Changyang Xiang Tian! Come all! I invite all of my guests here today, tomorrow there will be a feast in my son\u2019s honor! We shall celebrate greatly\u2026.\u201dIn a flash, a year had already passed. In front of a small lake, the figure of a child that wasn\u2019t even one meter tall stood about with a blank expression. Both of his eyes were staring attentively at the rock garden in the middle of the lake. The little boy was wearing a gorgeous set of clothes, but the expression on his face was unusually complex in a way that was strange to see on a one year old boy.To be precise, this boy was Changyang Xiang Tian. And in this moment inside of his mind, a hair raising scene was constantly playing. Just as if watching a movie reel, all he could see were pictures of mountain ranges that looked like two giant swords. Another image of a handsome young man of 20 years old with a sword came to his mind, along with the hundred year old battle hardened figure of Dugu Qiubai. Finally at the time of his immediate death, he remembered the breakthrough he had experienced that had allowed him to reach into the realm of the \u201dSword God\u201d. After that, he remembered stabbing Dugu Qiubai through the neck, ending in their mutual destruction\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: Refining the BodyXiang Tian looked at his tiny body and gasped; the look on his face could only be described as complex. Over the past year, he had lost count of how often moments of his past life had flashed before his eyes. The memories were so fresh in his mind, it was almost as if everything happened only yesterday; as if engraved into the very depths of his soul.. No matter what he did, he couldn\u2019t forget the memories, but he understood now; he was called Jian Chen in his past life. After his death, he had carried with him the mysteries of his memory and soul, and had been reincarnated.He retained all of his memories even after his reincarnation, so even after being born, he already knew how to talk. And according to the conversations from the people at his bedside, he had a rough idea of what type of household he was in. More importantly, he had learned that he was no longer in the same world as before. This was a new world that Jian Chen had never heard of.Even the mansion Jian Chen lived in had a name\u2013Changyang Mansion. The mansion belonged to one of Luo\u2019er City\u2019s top 4 families, each had a foothold of power and influence. His own father was actually the leader of the Changyang clan named Changyang Ba. His mother was named Bi Yuntian and was the fourth concubine for the clan leader. Although she wasn\u2019t the primary wife, she still had a considerable amount of power in the family because she held the title of a Radiant Saint Master.Even though Jian Chen didn\u2019t understand what a Radiant Saint Master was, he did understand that it was because his mother was a Radiant Saint Master that her status was high in the clan, and there were many that respected her.In regards to Jian Chen himself, he was the Changyang clan\u2019s fourth young lord, and had a majestic status within the clan. Jian Chen also had 2 elder brothers and an elder sister. The first brother was Changyang Hu, the sister was Changyang Mingyue, and the second brother was Changyang Ke. The four of them shared the same father, but each had a different mother. Excluding Changyang Hu, Changyang Mingyue and Changyang Ke had met with him multiple times and were both only a few years older than him. The eldest of the siblings was Changyang Ming Yue, who was 4 years old; 3 years older than Jian Chen. Changyang Ke was 2 years older than him. Aside from them 4 however, there were still many other children in the family.At this time, an elderly housekeeper came up from behind Jian Chen and spoke softly, \u201c4th young lord, it\u2019s getting late, and your mother is looking for you.\u201dJian Chen was immediately jolted back to reality. Looking at the sky, he had come to the sudden realization that the sky was dimming, an indication of the impending night. Unconsciously, Jian Chen had been standing there for the whole afternoon. \u201cI understand, Chang Bai. I will go back in a second.\u201dChang Bai was the housekeeper for the Changyang clan and essentially took care of every single matter within the family. Because of this, his status within the clan was fairly high. Although he was only a housekeeper, he had garnered a good amount of respect, practically the same amount as the head of the house himself had.A smile adorned Chang Bai\u2019s face as he watched Jian Chen with high expectations. Even when Jian Chen was only half a year old, he hadn\u2019t needed the help of others to walk, and quickly learned how to speak within 8 months. Not only could he speak clearly, but he could even communicate with others. With these two achievements alone, Jian Chen had already been called a genius, and many were eagerly awaiting to see how he would grow up.At night, Jian Chen accompanied his mother, Bi Yuntian, to eat dinner in the dining hall. The dining hall they both sat in was special; only the head of the house, his concubines, and his children could eat there.When Bi Yuntian and Jian Chen arrived at the dining hall, three beauties were already sitting at the circular dinner table. Each one of them looked to be in their 20s, and two of them each held a child in their arms. One of the children was a boy, and the other was a girl. The boy was around 3-4 years old, and was healthy but chubby. He was the third son and young lord of Changyang Ba\u2013Changyang Ke.The moment Changyang Ke saw Jian Chen, hostility and hatred swelled up in his eyes. It was clear to see that he was brimming with the intent to start something, and one could tell that he held a bias against Jian Chen.The four ladies could all sense the hostility radiating from Changyang Ke towards Jian Chan, but none of them spared a second thought about it. In their minds, this was merely a small matter between children, and definitely not something that would be of great matter.The other child was a 4-5 year old girl with two ponytails. Her bright eyes looked at the still hostile Changyang Ke and laughed. With her two dimples that appeared with each laugh, she looked exceptionally cute. Although she was underaged now, it was certain that after she grew older, she would have beauty that could rival the gods. This child was the second born of Changyang Ba, as well as the sole female child\u2013Changyang Mingyue.\u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re here! Come and sit!\u201d Upon seeing Jian Chen, the smile on her face had become even more splendid, as she waved him over.Jian Chen nodded towards Changyang Mingyue as a greeting, and sat down with his mother at the dinner table.Bi Yuntian began to pamper Jian Chen, softly saying, \u201cXiang\u2019er, say hello to your aunts and siblings.\u201dWithout any other choice, Jian Chen looked at the pampered ladies, \u201cHello eldest aunt, second aunt, third aunt, second sister, and third brother.\u201d Ever since his mother had discovered that he could speak efficiently, she had been ecstatically teaching him the basic rules of etiquette. With Jian Chen\u2019s \u201cgo with the flow\u201d mindset, he didn\u2019t object to her teachings. It would prove beneficial to him in the long run as well in this new world.When he had first arrived in this strange new place, he had struggled intensely with this new body. Since he was reincarnated with his old memories, he still felt like Jian Chen. Deep within his soul, he did not think this new life was his, but as time went on, he gradually accepted his new body and life. No matter what though, Bi Yuntian was still his mother. Although it was a mystery on how he managed to retain his memories, they had been from a place on another world. It had no relationship to this new world, so Jian Chen had decided to hide away the memories in the deepest part of his mind. It was time to accept his new life and give it everything he had.The three ladies all smiled at Jian Chen. One of the ladies wearing golden robes laughed, \u201cSister Yun Er, it would appear that Xiang Tian is getting more and more intelligent. Ai\u2026 it\u2019s getting harder and harder to only see him as a one year old child. I truly am envious of you for having such an intelligent child.\u201d The lady who spoke was the second wife of Changyang Ba and mother to Changyang Mingyue\u2013Bai Yushuang,\u201cThat\u2019s right, younger sister Yun Er, what second sister said is correct. Each and every day, I grow even more fond of Xiang Tian.\u201d Sitting next to Jian Chen with a tranquil look was another one of the 4 ladies. She was the third wife\u2013Yu Feng Yan.\u201cXiang Tian is certainly a child genius. To be able to walk at 6 months and speak at 8, these are feats that no other child his age would be able to replicate. I find myself anxious to see how much Saint Energy he has when he undergoes the test in 2 years, though I do sincerely hope that he will give us all a pleasant surprise when the time comes.\u201d The next lady who spoke was significantly older, and seemed much more temperamental than the others. She was the first wife\u2013Ling Long.The moment Ling Long finished her sentence, a deep manly voice spoke out, \u201cI agree. I look forward to when Xiang Tian reaches his 3rd year for this pleasant surprise as well.\u201d A 30 year old man entered the dining hall, carrying himself with the manner of a master. With a white chang pao decorated with golden outlines, and a head of black hair that reached his shoulders, the man gave off a relaxed atmosphere.\u201cHusband!\u201d\u201cFather!\u201dImmediately after seeing the man, the 7 people at the table all stood up at once and called out one after the other. Jian Chen was no exception, and softly cried out.This young man was indeed the head of the Changyang clan, Changyang Ba.Changyang Ba strolled down to the dinner table and sat down with a gentle smile on his face. With a look at Jian Chen, he asked, \u201cXiang\u2019er, are you feeling happy living here still?\u201dJian Chen nodded his head, \u201cYes!\u201dA smile curled up on Changyang Ba\u2019s face, \u201cXiang\u2019er, if you ever feel closed in this stuffy old house, feel free to explore the outside and experience it for yourself!\u201d\u201cI know, father!\u201d Jian Chen replied.Changyang Ba was indescribably happy at how intelligent Jian Chen was and how much he differed from any other one year old, .The family dinner went by joyously and the meal was consumed quickly. Afterwards, Jian Chen returned to his room alone. Based on his age, he should have been sleeping in the same room as his mother, but he had requested that he wanted his own room. Regarding this request, Jian Chen had been firm, and wouldn\u2019t be persuaded otherwise. Bi Yuntian had ended up accepting his request.And so that night, Jian Chen sat crossed-legged on his bed, with both of his hands on his knees. The palms of his hands were facing upwards, as was his face, as he silently went through the motions of practicing the first principle of Azulet Sword Law.Azulet Sword Law; this was what Jian Chen had been studying for 20 years in his previous world and had become the strongest weapon in his arsenal. It was a type of cultivation that was both rare and formidable; it had principles that were profound and also contained many strong techniques.The Azulet Sword Law was something that Jian Chen had stumbled upon when he was a child. He had accidentally fallen off of a cliff while playing in the mountains, and somehow managed to survive the fall by landing in a pool of water. When he had awoken, he had found himself trapped in a cavern with fish as his only source of food. After finding the manual, he had dedicated himself to learning it, and finally succeeded after 10 years. With his breakthrough, he was able to jump out of the cavern and return to the lands above.Jian Chen was a war orphan who had been taken in by his great grandfather and grandmother. 10 years had past while he was trapped in the cave, so when he had returned to the village, his great grandparents had already passed away from old age a long time ago. After paying his respects to them, the now alone Jian Chen left his little mountainside village to travel the world by himself.Jian Chen had accepted what life had given him in his past life, and he had accepted this new life as well. With this acceptance, he had started cultivating and refining his body for half a year, ready to regain his strength.Chapter 3: Refining the BodyXiang Tian looked at his tiny body and gasped; the look on his face could only be described as complex. Over the past year, he had lost count of how often moments of his past life had flashed before his eyes. The memories were so fresh in his mind, it was almost as if everything happened only yesterday; as if engraved into the very depths of his soul.. No matter what he did, he couldn\u2019t forget the memories, but he understood now; he was called Jian Chen in his past life. After his death, he had carried with him the mysteries of his memory and soul, and had been reincarnated.He retained all of his memories even after his reincarnation, so even after being born, he already knew how to talk. And according to the conversations from the people at his bedside, he had a rough idea of what type of household he was in. More importantly, he had learned that he was no longer in the same world as before. This was a new world that Jian Chen had never heard of.Even the mansion Jian Chen lived in had a name\u2013Changyang Mansion. The mansion belonged to one of Luo\u2019er City\u2019s top 4 families, each had a foothold of power and influence. His own father was actually the leader of the Changyang clan named Changyang Ba. His mother was named Bi Yuntian and was the fourth concubine for the clan leader. Although she wasn\u2019t the primary wife, she still had a considerable amount of power in the family because she held the title of a Radiant Saint Master.Even though Jian Chen didn\u2019t understand what a Radiant Saint Master was, he did understand that it was because his mother was a Radiant Saint Master that her status was high in the clan, and there were many that respected her.In regards to Jian Chen himself, he was the Changyang clan\u2019s fourth young lord, and had a majestic status within the clan. Jian Chen also had 2 elder brothers and an elder sister. The first brother was Changyang Hu, the sister was Changyang Mingyue, and the second brother was Changyang Ke. The four of them shared the same father, but each had a different mother. Excluding Changyang Hu, Changyang Mingyue and Changyang Ke had met with him multiple times and were both only a few years older than him. The eldest of the siblings was Changyang Ming Yue, who was 4 years old; 3 years older than Jian Chen. Changyang Ke was 2 years older than him. Aside from them 4 however, there were still many other children in the family.At this time, an elderly housekeeper came up from behind Jian Chen and spoke softly, \u201c4th young lord, it\u2019s getting late, and your mother is looking for you.\u201dJian Chen was immediately jolted back to reality. Looking at the sky, he had come to the sudden realization that the sky was dimming, an indication of the impending night. Unconsciously, Jian Chen had been standing there for the whole afternoon. \u201cI understand, Chang Bai. I will go back in a second.\u201dChang Bai was the housekeeper for the Changyang clan and essentially took care of every single matter within the family. Because of this, his status within the clan was fairly high. Although he was only a housekeeper, he had garnered a good amount of respect, practically the same amount as the head of the house himself had.A smile adorned Chang Bai\u2019s face as he watched Jian Chen with high expectations. Even when Jian Chen was only half a year old, he hadn\u2019t needed the help of others to walk, and quickly learned how to speak within 8 months. Not only could he speak clearly, but he could even communicate with others. With these two achievements alone, Jian Chen had already been called a genius, and many were eagerly awaiting to see how he would grow up.At night, Jian Chen accompanied his mother, Bi Yuntian, to eat dinner in the dining hall. The dining hall they both sat in was special; only the head of the house, his concubines, and his children could eat there.When Bi Yuntian and Jian Chen arrived at the dining hall, three beauties were already sitting at the circular dinner table. Each one of them looked to be in their 20s, and two of them each held a child in their arms. One of the children was a boy, and the other was a girl. The boy was around 3-4 years old, and was healthy but chubby. He was the third son and young lord of Changyang Ba\u2013Changyang Ke.The moment Changyang Ke saw Jian Chen, hostility and hatred swelled up in his eyes. It was clear to see that he was brimming with the intent to start something, and one could tell that he held a bias against Jian Chen.The four ladies could all sense the hostility radiating from Changyang Ke towards Jian Chan, but none of them spared a second thought about it. In their minds, this was merely a small matter between children, and definitely not something that would be of great matter.The other child was a 4-5 year old girl with two ponytails. Her bright eyes looked at the still hostile Changyang Ke and laughed. With her two dimples that appeared with each laugh, she looked exceptionally cute. Although she was underaged now, it was certain that after she grew older, she would have beauty that could rival the gods. This child was the second born of Changyang Ba, as well as the sole female child\u2013Changyang Mingyue.\u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re here! Come and sit!\u201d Upon seeing Jian Chen, the smile on her face had become even more splendid, as she waved him over.Jian Chen nodded towards Changyang Mingyue as a greeting, and sat down with his mother at the dinner table.Bi Yuntian began to pamper Jian Chen, softly saying, \u201cXiang\u2019er, say hello to your aunts and siblings.\u201dWithout any other choice, Jian Chen looked at the pampered ladies, \u201cHello eldest aunt, second aunt, third aunt, second sister, and third brother.\u201d Ever since his mother had discovered that he could speak efficiently, she had been ecstatically teaching him the basic rules of etiquette.

    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: Further TrainingThe Azulet Sword Law was divided into 12 different layers. The first layer was cultivating the body. A common saying was that if one wanted strong martial arts, then one must first have a strong body. After all, martial arts relied on the efficient use of the body; hence why the first layer of Azulet Sword Law was pertaining to the body.Most martial artists relied on strengthening their bodies in order to improve their own strength. Therefore they would strengthen their bodies and end up with bulging muscles everywhere. It was clear to the naked eye how strong someone was by build alone. Some people had even built their bodies to the point of their bones being as hard as reinforced steel bars.To Jian Chen, this type of method to train the body would only ruin the body and would only narrow the potential of the human body. So although this method would increase one\u2019s strength past a normal persons, at the same time, it would bring about a large amount of damage to the body. The people who trained this way generally had a short life span. When they were in the elderly phase, diseases and impairment within the body would happen at a higher frequency for them.The wandering martial artists of the world have many different sects with their own way of cultivating the body but to Jian Chen, these methods were mediocre. These were not the right paths to takes; even the Shaolin way of Yijin Jing was no exception.TL Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yijin_JingEven though the principles of Yijin Jing were beautiful in how it cultivated the inner strength and how it also strengthened the outer muscles, but Yijin Jing\u2019s way of strengthening the body was still the same. It didn\u2019t strengthen the very core of a human and only focused on external force only. This could not be be considered the pinnacle of cultivating the body if it did not target the entire body.The methods written in Azulet Sword Law were truly profound and magical. By absorbing both the Qi of the heavens and the earth and then transforming it, one could incorporate it within the bones of the body. This allowed every organ and even every single cell in the body to be strengthened to their limits. The original frailty would be cast away and the body would reach the most optimal state while giving the body endless amounts of benefits like a longer lifespan. When one practiced the later methods, your corporeal body would reach new heights in strength; and as Azulet Sword Law indicated, if one could reach the highest levels of cultivating the body, then they could even live as long as the heavens and the earth.However this method was associated with one\u2019s own strength. If one\u2019s Qi was stronger than the physical body, then Azulet Sword Law would use that Qi and incorporate that into the body to become stronger. In the case that one\u2019s physical body and one\u2019s Qi strength were both at an equilibrium, then one would have to make a breakthrough to reach the next level. Only with this cycle would one be able to continuously improve their entire body without limits.Jian Chen was slowly absorbing the world\u2019s Qi in a neverending stream and was circulating it in a cycle throughout his body. Then under Jian Chen\u2019s control, the Qi would be incorporated into his cells and organs.Ever since he had arrived at this strange new world, one of the few things that had excited Jian Chen was the World Essence. The World Essence was extremely dense, perhaps a hundred times more dense than the Qi back in his world. Compared to the previous world, Jian Chen had nowhere to go but the old mountain range where he had died. One world was paradise, the other world was hell, the difference was simply that clear to see, so Jian Chen was extremely happy about that.However what Jian Chen couldn\u2019t understand was the difference between the World Essence of this world and the World Essence of his past world. While both were the same in feeling, Jian Chen was carefully discovering that the World Essence had an extra type of energy. This type of energy was a small part of the World Essence and was interconnected as if blended together so that they could not be separated.When he had absorbed this new type of energy into his body, nothing negative happened. So because of that, Jian Chen had not tried to remove the clearly different energy from the World Essence. However, Jian Chen was now curious in the matter, thoughts and ideas were swirling around his head, but this new energy was not that simple to be figured out so easily.After the never ending World Essence had been absorbed into his body, Jian Chen could clearly feel every single artery and cell in his body become stronger. The World Essence that was taken into his body was like a giant health tonic that made his body feel alive as it absorbed it. His body was like a giant thirsty tiger that wanted more and more. While at the same time, Jian Chen was feeling a pleasurable sensation from all over, and felt free from worry as the feeling carried him away.In a flash, another year had gone by. Jian Chen had been in this strange world for 2 whole years now. During those 2 years, Jian Chen didn\u2019t take a single step outside of the Changyang mansion. Everyday during his free time, Jian Chen was alone in his room practicing the first principle of Azulet Sword Law\u2013body cultivation.Perhaps it was because this World Essence was a hundred times denser than the World Essence in his past world, but in one year Jian Chen had already reached major success in cultivating his body. At the current moment without a doubt, If an average person swung an average sword at him, then his body would not be scratched at all. He had trained his body so much that even a single cut would not be made.Of course, this was only what Jian Chen had thought of himself, he wouldn\u2019t dare try it out on himself personally.In this past year, Jian Chen\u2019s body was developing at such a fast rate, it was inconceivable. In a single year, he had already reached a height of 1.2 meter, an abnormal height for a 2 year old. This height had actually made him look to be closer to 5 or 6 years old instead.Because of this, everyone in the Changyang mansion had been alarmed beyond belief, although many of them still had vast expectations for him. Expectations hoping that he would be a genius with unlimited potential, but everyone would have to wait for when he turned 3 in order to confirm anything.Regarding this expectation put on him, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel helpless. He didn\u2019t understand that the reason why his body had grown so fast was due to practicing Azulet Sword Law because back in his previous world, he did not have Azulet Sword Law by his age.Although he still accompanied his mother Bi Yuntian to the dining hall, but as usual he had still shut himself off in his room every night. Sitting on the bed with crossed legs and his hands on his knees, he would close his eyes and face the sky once more.But this time, Jian Chen wasn\u2019t cultivating his body, but instead he was pondering. It had been 2 years since he arrived at this world, and in those 2 years, he had never seen the outside world from beyond Changyang mansion. He spent the majority of his days locked up to cultivate his body. Up until now, he still did not understand much about this world. Outside of Changyang mansion, he practically knew nothing about this world, even what the outside world looked like.He understood in his heart that in everyone else\u2019s eyes, he was a 2 year old boy. A 2 year old boy would generally be happily cherished by his parents while growing up carefreely. Jian Chen however, would not be in that situation at all.As he was thinking on his bed, Jian Chen finally decided that tomorrow morning, he would ask his parents. It was important for him to know and understand what the outside world was like in this world.After thinking it out, Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes and got off the bed. Tonight, he would not be cultivating his body on top of his bed as usual, but instead he would stand in the central point of his room with his eyes closed.In Jian Chen\u2019s mind, a pair of mysterious footsteps began to appear. Then a picture appeared inside of Jian Chen\u2019s mind. Just like a movie reel, the picture never seemed to stop, but all he could see was a figure wearing a white chang pao. It was a young man holding a sword that was quickly pacing through a mysterious land. He was walking so fast, that a regular person would have a hard time seeing him clearly. Because the young man was walking far too quickly despite the small amount of room he was in, a series of after images were trailing behind him.This figure was the previous incarnation of Jian Chen, and the steps that were appearing were actually symbolizing Azulet Sword Law, truly a mysterious image.As the morning daylight shone through a crack of a window into his room, Jian Chen suddenly opened his eyes as he stood in the middle of the room. In this hour, he had finally moved; his legs moved so fast that it was practically a blur. For his legs to maintain this type of speed for some time, even most martial artists wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up in this condition.Jian Chen\u2019s legs were moving in a mysterious way as he walked about in a certain trajectory. As he moved around his room quickly, his legs had whipped up a small whirlwind due to the extremely fast paced movement he was making.Although this event did not go on for long, Jian Chen stopped moving, as his face was turning paler by the second. Slowly gasping for breath, both of Jian Chen\u2019s legs couldn\u2019t help but shiver and quake as he paused.Jian Chen slowly walked to his window and sat down next to it. Bending his lower back, both of his arms massaged his legs continuously. Pursuing the mysterious footsteps for that one moment had caused his legs to become incomparably weak. He couldn\u2019t even use the smallest amount of power in his legs anymore.Jian Chen shook his head helplessly, no matter what type of martial art to cultivate himself, the first thing he had to do was attain a better build. Not only that but the more profound a martial art was, the higher its requirement. When it came to the exercise of following the footsteps, if he did not have a strong physical physique and a strong Qi, then he would not have been able to last very long. Of course, normal practitioners would not be able to hold up for as long as he had, and if they had tried, then they would have exerted their body beyond what it could take and damage it.It was not easy to acquire a profound ability after all.Sitting by his bed after massage his legs, he waited for his leg to be returned to their original state before sitting cross-legged on the bed again. Once more he began to absorb the spiritual Qi from the world and absorb it into his body.The night went by quickly and in a flash the sky was filled with the colors of the day. And at that moment, a sound could be heard coming outside of Jian Chen\u2019s room.\u201cFourth master, it\u2019s daytime, time to get up!\u201d. came the obviously feminine cry.Hearing the sound, Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes and cried out in his childish voice, \u201cI know, sister Hong Hua, I\u2019m already awake!\u201d With that said, he climbed down from his bed.Yet at this time, the door was opened, and two girls around the age of 18 came walking in. Both of them were carrying a small serving tray with a basin on it. Rolled around the basin was a new clean and tidy towel meant for him to wash his face with. The other tray had also another basin for Jian Chen to wash his teeth in to prepare himself for the dayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: Tian Yuan Continent\u201cSister Hong Hua, sister Dong Mei, thank you for your troubles.\u201d Looking at the the 18 year old girls, Jian Chen thanked the two quietly.These two maids were the servants of the Changyang family and were specifically meant to cater to the everyday needs of Jian Chen. Since Jian Chen was always by himself in his room, his mother Bi Yuntian had hired two servant girls to wait upon him.Hearing Jian Chen, the two girl laughed sweetly and then said, \u201cFourth master, by all means, don\u2019t be so polite. We are just doing what we are supposed to do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, fourth master, please refrain from being so courteous in the future. If the elders hear about the treatment you\u2019re giving us, then we may be penalized harshly.\u201d The other servant girl had said.Jian Chen smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t talk like this if others were around.\u201d Jian Chen was extraordinarily intelligent, and the Changyang mansion had strict rules regarding statuses. If the fourth master was to be heard saying such words, then it would be sure that the two girls would not be punished lightly.After washing his face, Jian Chen departed from his room and walked toward his mother\u2019s room as usual. The distance between the two wasn\u2019t far; it was only 20 meters away from his own room.Shortly after entering the room, Jian Chen saw his mother at the dressing table putting on makeup with the help of her own two servant girls standing next to her.\u201cXiang\u2019er, you\u2019re here earlier than usual today.\u201d With a glance at Jian Chen, a gentle smile full of love and adoration could be seen.Seeing that expression of love on her face, Jian Chen\u2019s own heart became soft. In his previous world, Jian Chen had lost both parents when he was small and thus had never known about motherly love, or even experienced it. But when he had came to this world, he had clearly felt the power of this motherly love. And so because of that, he had started to treasure this feeling of love slowly over time.Jian Chen walked up to the side of his mother and rubbed his stomach and said with an embarrassed laugh, \u201cYour son is hungry!\u201d After the rigorous exercise from last night, he had been feeling the slight pangs of hunger.Bi Yuntian placed a gentle hand on top of Jian Chen\u2019s head and laughed, \u201cThen in a moment mother will take you to the dining hall to eat.\u201d\u201cYea!\u201d Jian Chen nodded his head, a look of satisfaction on his face. In his heart, he secretly enjoyed the loving concern his mother had shown him.Pausing for another second, Jian Chen opened his mouth again, \u201cMother!\u201dBi Yuntian looked at Jian Chen warmly and said, \u201cXiang\u2019er, if you have something you want to say, say it!\u201dJian Chen hesitated for a second before recollecting his inner thoughts. Looking at his mother again, he said, \u201cMother, could you please tell your child what the outside world is like.\u201dHearing Jian Chen, Bi Yuntian was clearly shocked by his question. Opening her mouth, she asked, \u201cXiang\u2019er, could it be you\u2019re interested in the outside world?\u201d\u201cYour son is only curious!\u201d He answered.Bi Yuntian laughed, \u201cXiang\u2019er, the outside world is extremely vast and also extremely complicated. The matters of the outside world could not be made clear through words alone. If you want to learn about it, then it would be best if you went to the library and read a few books on it.\u201d Even as she voiced her answer, Bi Yuntian\u2019s face had looked a little bit helpless. \u201cBut Xiang\u2019er, you still don\u2019t know how to read, even if you go to the library, you wouldn\u2019t be able to read any of the words.\u201d\u201cMother, then why don\u2019t we bring some people to teach me how to read?\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s voice contained some dissatisfaction.Giggling, Bi Yuntian said, \u201cXiang\u2019er, you are only 2 years old. Your mother has never heard or seen a 2 year old child learn how to read before. Even in the entire Tian Yuan continent, this type of situation has never happened before. Generally speaking, the earliest any child has ever started to learn to read was when they were around 4 to 5 years old.\u201dJian Chen understood instantly, \u201cMother, your son wants to learn to read. Could you please find some people to try and teach me still?\u201dBi Yuntian was speechless, but a happy smile crept up on her face nonetheless. \u201cXiang\u2019er, learning to read is an exhausting task as well as being extremely boring. You must understand that there are many different words in the continent. This isn\u2019t something that can be learned quickly, are you sure you want to start learning now?\u201dJian Chen nodded his head in confirmation, \u201cI am!\u201dHearing Jian Chen\u2019s answer, Bi Yuntian\u2019s smile became even more splendid. With a happy laugh, she said, \u201cIf this is what Xiang\u2019er\u2019s request is, then mother will support you entirely.\u201d Turning her head, she called out, \u201cXiao Liu! In a moment, go to Lore City and hire the most prestigious teacher and bring him to the mansion so he can teach my Xiang\u2019er how to read\u201d!\u201cYes, my lady!\u201d The servant girl who was combing Bi Yuntian\u2019s hair agreed respectfully.\u201cXiang\u2019er, it\u2019s been a decent amount of time, let us go to the dining halls before the both of us starve.\u201dThe day went by quickly, and when the second day came, the teacher Bi Yuntian had hired arrived at the mansion and began to teach him to read.\u201dAnd so from that moment on, Jian Chen would spend his daytime earnestly studying how to read. Since he retained some mental fortitude and knowledge from his memories of the past. Learning the written language of this new world was not all that difficult. Combined with the teacher who was putting his heart and soul in teaching him as well as his amazing memorization capabilities, learning to read was extremely fast and easy for him. In just a short span of three months, he had already mastered the most basic words of the continent.Jian Chen\u2019s learning rate had made the teacher exclaim in astonishment. Immediately after Bi Yuntian had learned that he had learned most of the written language in three months, she couldn\u2019t believe it. In the end, she had put Jian Chen in a test before she could accept the fact. If one wanted to read and write most of the words used in the continent to the extent Jian Chen had, then one needed to spend at least 2 years. To have Jian Chen accomplish this in 3 months while it took most 2 years, not even any of the geniuses could claim to have accomplished this feat.This achievement quickly reached the ears of Jian Chen\u2019s father. Changyang Ba had then personally paid a visit to Jian Chen about it.\u201cXiang\u2019er, you have endured much in such a short amount of time, it\u2019s time to relax for now. Let your father give you a reward; since you have painstakingly learned to read in these past few months, I don\u2019t know what reward Xiang\u2019er would want though.\u201d Changyang Ba\u2019s face contained a smile as he looked down at Jian Chen as he spoke. Having such a genius for a son, he was extremely proud of himself and cared much more for Jian Chen than any other child automatically.Hearing this, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes brightened and thought for only a few seconds before responding, \u201cFather, would you allow your son to go to the library and read some of the books there so I can get some experience and learn even more.\u201dChangyang Ba\u2019s eyes brightened as he looked at Jian Chen with gratification. With a loud laugh, he said, \u201cThis is no problem at all, Xiang\u2019er. You have a heart that desires to improve itself, and your father is proud of this. I approve of your request, the library will be free to you whenever you desire.\u201d\u201cThank you father!\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face exuded a happy expression. To be able to enter the library was an achievement that Jian Chen could truly be happy about. After all, he had understood that the library wasn\u2019t a place anyone could walk in freely. One had to be 6 years old or older and had to be directly descended from the Changyang clan in order to enter. Of course, if one received the permission from the clan leader then the requirements could be waived.Soon after, Changyang Ba began to dote upon Jian Chen for a while before departing from his room. After he had left, Jian Chen wasn\u2019t able to sit in his room any longer. Immediately exiting his room, he headed toward the direction of the library. After studiously learning how to read for 3 months, it all led up to this moment of being able to enter the library and look up information pertaining to the outside world. Even if there wasn\u2019t much details on the outside world in the books, Jian Chen could always go ask his mother. But the books definitely had more details than his mother as well as being quite comprehensive. As a result, Jian Chen had placed more importance on the books.The location of the library had already been answered for Jian Chen a long time ago; it was in the back of his family\u2019s courtyard in a large pagoda. When Jian Chen entered the courts in the back, he immediately felt the presence of many experts concealed in every directions and were staring at him with viper like eyes.With his head high and proud, Jian Chen pretended that he didn\u2019t sense the experts and walked further into the tower. If he let other people know that he could sense people that were looking at him from concealed areas, then a series of troublesome questions would follow. He was a 2 year child after all without any knowledge about martial arts.Changyang Mansion had many direct descendants, but not many people were heading toward the library. So the only people Jian Chen had seen were the guards that protected the area, and almost no other clan member.Jian Chen quickly reached the doors to the tower before stopping to lift his head up to see the extremely large board hung above the doors of the tower. The words \u201cBook Pavilion\u201d were written in fancy writing, with 2 guards standing below it. When he looked at the two guards, he could tell these guards were definitely not lacking in strength.Waiting for the gates to open, Jian Chen then walked in directly without being obstructed by the two guards. They were almost like woodcarvings that stood motionlessly on the side with their backs straight. Even when Jian Chen had appeared, the two did not even greet him.As Jian Chen entered the inner tower, a long and narrow corridor greeted his eyes. It was daytime on the outside, and light shined down beautifully, leaving a sight like none other. On the walls of the corridor, a bright moon pearl was hung and gave off a light to illuminate the hallway.The length of the corridor was quite long, before finally splitting into two paths. Jian Chen estimated that both paths followed the opposite sides of the tower before finally rejoining again after a distance.\u201cFourth master, the clan leader has said you have the authority to access the left side of the tower.\u201d An elderly voice called out. Coming out from the shadows slowly was a tall figure.Jian Chen turned around after hearing this; although the light in this part of the tower was dim, he could clearly make out the appearance of the figure in the midst of the shadows. It was an elderly figure with white hair and wrinkles all over. Wearing a silver chang pao that was devoid of any other colors, even still he was relatively normal looking, no one would suspect he wasn\u2019t anything more than an ordinary elderly man.No matter how much Jian Chen looked at the old man, he couldn\u2019t see anything but mediocrity. Although he still didn\u2019t dare underestimate the old man. It was his inner instincts that told him that this old figure was an expert with extraordinary strength. The strongest man he had seen since he had entered this world was his father Changyang Ba, but it was impossible to measure his father to what Jian Chen was feeling from this old man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: Saint\u2019s TestAlthough Jian Chen could see through his frail appearance and find the true strength of the old man, he remained motionless and did not reveal anything on his face. With a silent nod to show his thanks, he stepped by the old man and proceeded down the left corridor.Arriving at the end of the corridor, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes began to shine brightly as he walked into a large room. The light in this room was exceptionally bright, so much so that it was comparable to the light outside. Many neat and tidy bookshelves that contained thousands of books lined the walls of the library.Jian Chen slowly tilted his head to look at the ceiling. He knew that the reason why the light was so bright was due to the ceiling. He had no idea what material the ceiling was made from, but it was strangely emitting a strong glow. Although the light was somewhat intense, it was not to the point of irritating the eyes.Although the ceiling had piqued his interest, he wasn\u2019t willing to squander time by trying to figure it out. Walking up to a bookshelf, he finally grabbed a book and started flipping through it.The book had fairly clear descriptions written inside, despite it not being as thick as the others. It had taken Jian Chen 3 hours to completely read through the book. Because of this, he had finally gained some insights regarding this strange world.This continent was called the Tian Yuan continent and was fairly big. There were numerous countries of various sizes and even more cities of all sizes. The biggest cities were known as the Capitals and each one stretched across countless miles, and each of these Capitals were ruled by a city ruler. Each ruler was also in charge of several million up to ten million guardian soldiers.However, within the entire Tian Yuan continent, there were only 7 Capitals while 3 of the 7 were controlled by a single strong empire. Among the strongest empires were the Karl Empire and the Felicity Empire who both controlled two Capitals each. It was the Holy Empire that controlled the first 3 Capitals.Under the Capitals were the King Cities, but the King Cities were smaller than the Capitals by a huge amount. Practically every kingdom had at the very least one King City and each King City had a million guardian soldiers. Under the King Cities were the First Class Cities which had 800,000 guardian soldiers. The Second Class Cities had 400,000 guardian soldiers each. Under the Second Class Cities were the varying villages which all had their own guardian soldiers but their numbers wouldn\u2019t reach over 50,000. Even their strength and numbers varied greatly.The Tian Yuan continent had people that all practiced something called the \u201cSaint Force\u201d. When their Saint Force reached the 10th level, then based on the expert\u2019s ideology, the saint force will condense into a Saint\u2019s Weapon. There were over 1000 shapes and each were completely dependent on the expert\u2019s ideology.As a result of the Saint Weapon forming from the \u201cSaint Force\u201d, once it formed, it formed a special link with the expert. Some people with an outstanding gift would receive a Saint Weapon with a special attribute. These attributes were classified as Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, Light, and Dark. Among these elements, light and dark were rarely seen, but were still extremely powerful.The light element was extremely strong in the healing aspect, and those who had light attributed Saint Weapons were given the title of Immortals in the Tian Yuan continent. They were given this title due to the fact that while on the battlefield, they could easily restore any damage taken. On the battlefield, if they were not killed in one strike, then they would be nearly impossible to defeat.Those with the dark element had a corrosive nature. Not only was this a troublesome element, but those with dark attributes were also in demand. At night, they could come and go as they pleased, earning them the titles of Night Lords, for the night was under their command.The rest of the 4 elements each had their own corresponding strengths. The amount of power they had depended on one\u2019s own strength and judgement. Of course in the Tian Yuan continent, those who had a Saint Weapon with an attribute was 1 in 10 compared to those who didn\u2019t have an attribute. On a battlefield, those with an attribute were often harder to fight against than those who didn\u2019t.The Saint Weapons were the strongest of weapons. In a war, Saint Weapons could be freely summoned at will and provide assistance to their masters to help overcome their limits. At the same time, a Saint Weapon and its master\u2019s life were intertwined. Whatever injury the Saint Weapon sustained would then be equally reflected back to the master. Also, if the Saint Weapon ever broke, then the master would receive a fatal wound as well. If the situation was grave, then even a wound may cause death.However, Saint Weapons were extremely hard to break. As long as the Saint Weapon was stronger than the opposing force, then it would not be harmed in any way.After a Saint Weapon takes shape, then this new way of cultivation would absorb the Qi from the world to become stronger. This method would improve one\u2019s own strength as well.Once the Saint Weapon was formed, then the expert would be called a \u201cSaint\u201d. In the Tian Yuan continent, the Saints are classified into 9 different levels: Saint, Great Saint, Saint Master, Great Saint Master, Earth Saint Master, Heaven Saint Master, Saint Ruler, Saint King and Saint Emperor. Within each of the levels, they are further separated into 3 levels: Lower, Middle, and Upper.Within the Tian Yuan continent, there lies a mountain range that was spread out across the continent called the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts. The range was filled with countless magical beasts. The further you went in, the stronger the beasts would get.These magical beasts were also separated into 9 levels. The class 1 beasts were equivalent to a Saint, while the class 2 beasts was equivalent to a Great Saint. Continuing on with this, a class 8 beast was on par with a Saint King and finally, a class 9 beast was equivalent to a Saint Emperor.At the same time, the Tian Yuan continent had a very prominent profession called the Mercenary. According to this book, the Tian Yuan continent had many mercenaries. These mercenaries would accomplish a variety of tasks for money, although many mercenaries would enter the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts to hunt monsters and sell the monster cores for money.Although the dangers were big, the rewards were just as generous due to monster cores being highly valued in the continent. The higher grade a monster core was, the higher priced it was. There were some high ranked monster cores that could not be bought with money alone.Monster cores were one of the most desired items in the continent. Inside the center of a monster core was a large amount of pure energy and could be absorbed by humans for a faster training speed. Absorbing the energy from a monster core was ultimately faster than trying to absorb the World Essence into one\u2019s body. However, using the monster cores to increase the cultivation speed wasn\u2019t a method the general populace could do without having plenty of money.Other than a few odd things, Jian Chen was finally beginning to understand many things about this world. This world was exceptionally cruel and wars happened everywhere. The people of this world were more dangerous in comparison to his old world. If one wasn\u2019t strong enough, then they would find it hard to survive. Most of the people on the continent were practitioners as well, although the average practitioner would be of average strength. The average person wouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate their Saint Force to the 10th level and be able to condense it into a Saint\u2019s Weapon. If these people don\u2019t have the proper training and support, then they would remain at the lowest levels similar to a peasant in the mountains.After finishing the books, Jian Chen finally understood the new world to a better degree. Saint Weapons, elements and attributes, magical beasts, monster cores and mercenaries, everything was a new experience to Jian Chen that gave his heart a thrill. He was looking forward to the new world and desperately wished to leave the Changyang mansion immediately. To be able to experience the outside world would be a refreshing change of pace.However, Jian Chen knew that he would not be able to fulfill his desires in the upcoming years. His parents would never allow a three year old child to leave their home for the outside world. Even if he could leave his home, he would have no way of defending himself.After a long period of time, Jian Chen decided to put even more effort into his training. Aside from his daily meals, everyday was spent training alone within his room. He still hadn\u2019t completed the basics of the cultivation stage of Azulet Sword Law, so the World Essence he had been absorbing was distributed equally throughout his body, entering each cell and strengthening his body.It was only when his body could no longer be strengthened by the World Essence would Jian Chen be able to break through to the second stage, where he would start the formal training of his True Qi. Currently, Jian Chen still had the physique far beyond that of a normal person, however some regions of his body where Qi previously gathered in his past world were still empty.In his previous world, Jian Chen had managed to finish the cultivation stage within a single year. Since this World Essence was stronger by at least twofold, even though it was taking him more than 2 years to make a breakthrough, his body was getting stronger and stronger, giving his current body the potential to be even stronger than his previous body.Although Jian Chen normally spent the entire day hiding in his room to cultivate, neither of his parents had outwardly expressed any sort of bafflement or concern. The reason for this was because in the Changyang mansion, the parents would generally teach the children a method of breathing and let them train for a year. By the third year, these children would take a test to see how strong their Saint Power was and evaluate their potential as well as their aptitude. When Jian Chen was 2 years old, Bi Yuntian had taught him the same breathing method as the other children had learned. However, Jian Chen had taken this breathing exercise and tossed it into the depths of his mind, for Jian Chen had felt that this sort of training was like giving an adult a child\u2019s toy to play with.As a result, Jian Chen had locked himself in his room. People passing by had only thought that Jian Chen was practicing the breathing method, and paid no attention to him.The following morning, Jian Chen had finally finished last night\u2019s cultivation exercise. Today was a special day for him, since it was his 3rd birthday. At the same time, today would be the day that he would undergo the very same test as any other 3 year old in the Tian Yuan continent\u2013the Saint\u2019s Test.Accompanying his mother Bi Yuntian to the dining halls, Jian Chen was then later taken to the Changyang clan\u2019s official main hall.The Changyang mansion covered a large amount of area, and compared to the area Jian Chen was used to, he had only experienced a small portion of the land. Walking along the road, Jian Chen looked at the mansion without stopping. In his first 3 years, Jian Chen had spent the vast majority of his time within his own room and cultivated, very rarely did he stroll around the mansion.Within the Changyang mansion, a large group of uniformed patrolmen were walking around the area. Many sharp eyes were staring all around from hidden areas, and despite it being the daytime, they still did not show the slightest sense of relaxation.As Jian Chen walked past a series of training grounds, a young, but soft shout had gotten his attention from the inside. A mere glance inside would show a small group of 10 year olds being taught some martial art drills by a middle aged man.Jian Chen understood in his heart that these children were disciples born directly into the family line. The Changyang clan had about 1000 clansmen. Although half of them were guardsmen and servants, the other half were members that were born from within the clan line.Walking past the training grounds, Bi Yuntian led her son to the middle of an official looking hallway. This was where Jian Chen would undergo the Saint\u2019s Test.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Forgotten GeniusEven though the outside hall was vast, the interior of the Changyang main hallways were even larger. Currently there were dozens of people strewn about, among them were a few middle-aged men who were dressed differently that stood out from the rest.Bi Yuntian led Jian Chen to their seats in the front of the hallway. Those who had wanted to sit at the front had to have a high status in the clan, and since Jian Chen was the fourth son of the clan leader, he had the right to sit at the front. However, his own seat wasn\u2019t created yet, so he had to share a single chair with his mother.The lovable Jian Chen sat down on his mother\u2019s lap gently and didn\u2019t say anything.In a flash, a line of people came streaming into the hall one by one before stopping in front of their seats. Among the newcomers was Jian Chen\u2019s third aunt carrying her child along.\u201cHey\u2026fourth brother, today is the day you take the Saint Test. You have to work hard so you don\u2019t let second sister down.\u201d Changyang Mingyue\u2019s pretty face smiled at Jian Chen as she spoke in a soft but enthusiastic voice. Although she was soft spoken, everyone in the hall had clearly heard who and what she was talking about.\u201cMing Yue!\u201d Her mother looked at her sharply as she spoke with soft rebuke.Changyang Mingyue laughed and stuck her tongue out at Jiang Chen. Without any further words, she peacefully sat down right next to her mother\u2019s side as her bright eyes blinked rapidly as she sized up the other people in the hall.Soon enough, everybody in the hall were all seated while they all looked at Jian Chen from time to time with looks of expectations shown clearly on their faces. The reason why many people were gathered was due to Jian Chen\u2019s Saint Test.If it was any other child of the clan, then there would not had been such a massive turnout for the Saint Test. But Jian Chen wasn\u2019t a regular child with no status; he was the child to the clan leader of the Changyang clan as well as having an innate talent blessed by the heavens. The whole clan had practically placed all of their expectations on this child, hence why when it was Jian Chen\u2019s turn to undergo the Saint Test, every clan member would be there.After all, Jian Chen had many different achievements under his belt, and the Saint Test would be another important milestone for him.When everyone had settled down, Jian Chen\u2019s father Changyang Ba stepped towards the middle of the hall and sat down on the throne that signified his status as the clan leader with a great blade right next to him.Changyang Ba\u2019s eyes stopped on Jian Chen for only a second but Jian Chen could see the faintest of smiles on it. Immediately afterwards, a voice spoke out, signifying the start of Jian Chen\u2019s Saint Test.\u201cDe Shu, I\u2019m sorry to have you take control of the Saint Test ceremony.\u201d Changyang Ba said politely towards the elder.The elder looked to be around 60 to 70 years old white haired man who wore gray clothing. Although his face was full of wrinkles, his eyes were bright and filled with excitement.The old man laughed, \u201cThe clan leader is too modest.\u201d Walking towards the center now, he carried a smile on his face as he looked at Jian Chen before calling out in a friendly tone, \u201cFourth Master, if you please!\u201dBi Yuntian looked at Jian Chen with a great look of affection and whispered, \u201cXiang\u2019er, please go to where De Shu is standing so he can test for your Saint Force.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Jian Chen said lightly. The clever child got off of his seat and with his small paces, he slowly approached to where the Elder De stood.Without further ado, De Shu lifted his right hand where a small silver ring began to glow with a dazzling white light. Waving it over, the smallest of trembles could be heard coming from the ground before slowly increasing in sound. Right where there was nothing in front of them, a white stone half a meter large suddenly appeared. It was clear to see that the white stone had been polished countless of times; the entire rectangular shaped rock, the width and thickness was both at a meter long.Looking at the newly emerged white stone, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes blinked in surprise, he had felt quite curious about this stone but De Shu\u2019s right hand had also caught his interest. He stared intensely at the ring on his middle finger, it was the ring he had seen from the books.The Space Ring was made from rare but special materials, and could store items within the space of the ring. The smallest object it could store was a meter cubed, while the biggest object it could store was a hundred meters cubed. One could store and take out any inanimate object as they pleased. This was an item that was so expensive in the Tian Yuan continent that the common person would not be able to afford it.Seeing Jian Chen looking at the Space ring adorned on his middle finger, De Shu laughed. Whenever he had summoned the white stone for the Saint Test, everyone around would give him the same exact look. In fact, he had seen the look so many times, he had lost count.\u201cFourth master, please place a hand on the Saint Stone.\u201d De Shu smiled.The Saint Stone is a special rock that could measure the amount of Saint Force within a person\u2019s body. Within the large Tian Yuan continent, there are many different items that could measure one\u2019s personal strength. The Saint Stone used colors to represent a person\u2019s strength\u2013Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple.Having the stone flash red meant that the person was still below a Saint in strength while an orange color meant that the person was at the same level as a Saint. The yellow color represents a Great Saint and blue meant the person was an Earth Saint Master. Lastly, a purple color represented a Heaven Saint Master. Any rank higher than the Heaven Saint Master like a Saint Ruler, Saint King, and Saint Emperor could not be ranked by the Saint Stone.Hearing De Shu, Jian Chen focused back on the task and extended his hand onto the white stone called the \u201cSaint Rock\u201d.At that moment, everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on the Saint Rock. They all stood up in anticipation, anxious to find out how strong the gifted Jian Chen would be.When Jian Chen placed his hand on the Saint Rock, De Shu extended his own arm to activate the Saint Rock through seemingly magical means.Immediately, Jian Chen could only feel an odd type of energy pulse from the stone and into his arm. While the energy felt odd to him, it entered his body quite gently where it slowly circulated around before pulsing back out from his body and into the stone.De Shu stared at the Saint Rock for any change in color, but after a short period of time, there was no change at all. Not even a single shade of color other than its original one could be seen.\u201cHow is this possible, the Saint Rock doesn\u2019t even have a sliver of color reflected!\u201d De Shu couldn\u2019t help but cry out in alarm. The smile that had been on his face slowly disappeared from his face and turned to look at Jian Chen\u2019s own face with an odd expression. Neither of the two could believe what was going on.Taking note of the look of shock on De Shu\u2019s face and the still white Saint Rock, everyone subconsciously came to a realization. Their faces couldn\u2019t help but slowly change as they looked at their neighbors, then back at the front. Blinking once, the look of abject bewilderment was noticeable on most people\u2019s face while some people even sighed with looks of pity.Changyang Ba\u2019s face grew ugly while even Bi Yuntian\u2019s face drained of color. Neither of the two looked as if they were refusing to believe the news.De Shu gave a gulp, this result was unbelievable to even him. Immediately starting up the Saint Rock again, he had hoped that it was a mistake the first time. But alas, the tree had bore no fruit, and the rock no color.Again, this result was inconceivable to De Shu. The fourth master had been called a gifted genius since he was born, but it had seemed as if he was nothing more than a cripple who couldn\u2019t cultivate or use Saint Force at all.De Shu couldn\u2019t help but give a disappointed sigh as he looked at the silent Jian Chen with a complicated look. He turned around to face Changyang Ba, \u201cClan leader, the results are in. The Fourth master is unable to cultivate the Saint Force in any way.\u201dUpon hearing this declaration, Bi Yuntian\u2019s face grew even more pale to the point that it was almost devoid of color. Looking at Jian Chen dumbfounded, she muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s\u2026not possible\u2026how can Xiang\u2019er\u2026be a cripple\u2026?\u201d Right as she finished, her eyes rolled to the back of her head and crumpled down to the ground from her chair. For her son that was widely regarded as a genius to suddenly be found as a cripple, she couldn\u2019t handle this shocking news at all. No mother in the continent would be able to, let alone a member of a very prestigious clan.As everyone that had gathered around heard the results, they all gasped and looked at Jian Chen with pity and disappointment. Jian Chen\u2019s aunts Yu Feng Yan and Ling Long on the other hand, let loose a breath of air. Seeing the mother and son\u2019s unfortunate situation, the two aunts couldn\u2019t help but rejoice silently to themselves.\u201cAh, fourth sister\u2026fourth sister, what\u2019s wrong? Fourth sister, please wake up! Fourth Sister, please\u2026please wake up!\u201d Rushing to her side, Bai Yushuang anxiously tried to awaken the unconscious Bi Yuntian, but to no avail.Hearing Bai Yushuang\u2019s frantic yells, Changyang Ba immediately bounded over to Bi Yuntian and began to cry out, \u201cShuang Er, bring Yun Er to her bed!\u201dEven Jian Chen had rushed to his mother\u2019s side without paying attention to anyone else. His right hand was already pressed against his mother\u2019s wrist to check for her pulse. It took a few precious seconds, but he had eventually confirmed that his mother was in no immediate danger.Jian Chen looked at his disappointed father amongst the crowd, and even he had felt helpless secretly. With a small sigh, he followed Bai Yushuang who was carrying his mother out of the hall.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d Watching Jian Chen leave, Changyang Ba\u2019s face clearly had a look of extreme disappointment. He had placed high hopes on Jian Chen before, but as the expectations were very high, so was the later disappointment. With this result in the end, his fourth son Xiang Tian was merely a cripple.\u201cClan head, don\u2019t pay too much attention to this. Although the fourth master cannot cultivate Saint Force, it doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a genius in other aspects or fields.\u201d A young male clan member tried to console him.Changyang Ba waved his hand and said sadly, \u201cLet\u2019s not mention this topic anymore. Everyone is dismissed.\u201d Finishing his sentence, Changyang Ba stood up to leave the hall. Although he had acknowledged the fact that Jian Chen could be a genius in the other fields as said earlier, but Saint Force was the most important factor in this world, after all, strength is what mattered in the end.The fact that the fourth son of the leader of the Changyang clan was a cripple spread throughout the Changyang mansion like wildfire. Some people regarded this new piece of information with joy while others were grievous. One thing was sure however; Xiang\u2019er\u2019s status in the clan would rapidly drop after this affair.In a wide spacious room, Jian Chen sat quietly by the bedside. His tranquil face was dipped downwards and what he was thinking about was unknown to everyone else. His mother Bi Yuntian still hadn\u2019t woke up, her eyes were still shut as she laid in bed. Aside from Jian Chen and some servant girls, only his third aunt Bai Yushuang and his second sister Changyang Mingyue were in the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She walked up to Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cFourth brother, please don\u2019t feel too sad. If anyone in the future bullies you, tell your older sister and I\u2019ll beat them up.\u201d Changyang Mingyue thought that Jian Chen was feeling sad because he was a cripple and that he didn\u2019t have the ability to defend himself from anyone that would mock him.Hearing what Ming Yue had said, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but lift his head to smile at Changyang Mingyue, \u201cDon\u2019t worry second sister, I won\u2019t be an easy person to bully.\u201dOnly Jian Chen understood that it wasn\u2019t because he was unable to cultivate Saint Force, it was due to the fact that he had been incorporating the Saint Force into the cells of his body. Because of this, his body was essentially an empty shell, with no Saint Force remaining in his body. If he hadn\u2019t used this method, then today\u2019s Saint Test would have had a different result.It was unfortunate that Jian Chen wouldn\u2019t be able to explain this situation to people. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain how he came about this method. Not to mention that if he were to talk about Azulet Sword Law, then Jian Chen feared that the the history of both the technique and himself would become a great problem.Although Jian Chen had understood that because of this situation, his status within the clan had taken a major hit. He didn\u2019t care at all for that however and had secretly wanted a situation like this to happen. If things had progressed as well as they did just now, then in the future he would be able to leave the Changyang mansion with more ease. If he had still been stuck with the label of a genius, then departing from the mansion would not be as easy. At the very least, as long as he didn\u2019t have their approval, they would ignore his trips in and out of the mansion.\u201cXiang\u2019er\u2026Xiang\u2019er\u2026\u201d A voice came calling out from the bed, Jian Chen\u2019s mother had finally awakened.Right after hearing his mother call his name, Jian Chen\u2019s mind was jolted back to consciousness. He immediately turned around to look at her, \u201cMother, your son is here, everything is fine now.\u201dBi Yuntian had a complicated look on her face as she gasped, \u201cYour mother is fine, but Xiang\u2019er\u2026ai\u2026.\u201d As she spoke, a myriad of expressions were shown on her face ranging from sorrow, sadness, and even pain.\u201cFourth sister, please don\u2019t trouble yourself too much. Xiang Tian has been highly intelligent since birth, so although it is regretful that he cannot cultivate Saint Force, but in my opinion, Xiang Tian is not so simple. After all, no child in the clan is smarter than him.\u201d Bai Yu Shuan was trying to console the still grievous Bi Yuntian.Bi Yuntian lifted her head slowly, \u201cI had already understood this fact,.\u201d Looking a Jian Chen, she gently started to caress the back of Jian Chen\u2019s head. \u201cXiang\u2019er, don\u2019t feel sad, what your second aunt said is correct. Although you cannot cultivate Saint Force, you are still a very intelligent child, we still don\u2019t know in what areas you would be best suited for.\u201dJian Chen hesitated when he heard his mother speak, even though his mother was awake, he was not feeling all that much better. In reality, he had really wanted to tell the truth to the people there, his mother most definitely. He wanted to say that he wasn\u2019t a cripple that couldn\u2019t cultivate Saint Force, but Jian Chen chose to endure this. \u201cMother, don\u2019t worry, your son won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d Compared to his mother\u2019s love for him, Jian Chen had utterly cherished it.He would later spend the whole day by the bedside of his mother before leaving at night. Periodically, Changyang Ba would drop in to see his wife but he would then leave just as quickly as he came. When it came to Jian Chen, Changyang Ba\u2019s attitude towards him had been completely different these days in comparison to before. With each passing time, Jian Chen could clearly see that Changyang Ba had been treating Jian Chen with a colder expression.In the blink of an eye, four years had passed after Jian Chen\u2019s Saint Test. During the days that he wasn\u2019t busy, Jian Chen would shut himself in his room to continue training. The amount of training he needed nowadays was considerably longer than in the past; so much longer, that sometimes, Jian Chen would not be seen walking out of his room for the entire day.In those four years, Jian Chen\u2019s status in the clan had dropped immensely as expected. Changyang Ba had been treating him more coldly now, and no one had ever bothered to take the initiative to seek him out first. It was vastly different than from his mother who saw him everyday, her love had never wavered at all.Early one day, Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes from his crossed-legged position once more to show that he had finished last nights training. Immediately extending both arms palmside up, a light round ball gradually came into view. He flipped the beautiful ball into the air from his hands and watched it fall towards the ground where it came to a stop as both his hands were focused on it.Hearing only the slightest of sounds, Jian Chen clapped his tiny hands together as if they were 2 steel plates and started to do pushups on the normally soft ground, occasionally bringing his head so close to the ground he could kiss it and even left an imprint on the ground afterwards.Looking at his own hard work with a joyous smile, Jian Chen laughed. Half a year after the Saint Test, Jian Chen had already finished the cultivation stage of the first principle of the Azulet Sword Law. This meant that he officially started to cultivate the Saint Force without having to assimilate it into his own body. His cultivation rate was extremely fast, so fast that in the span of a just few years, he had already reached an astounding result. As he was now, he could use the Saint Force that was stored inside of him to reinforce his hands so that they could break through stone without effort.Early in the morning, Jian Chen walked out of his room to wander around the Changyang Mansion alone. However, a group of patrolmen were walking around at the time spotted him, with each member having a different expression on their faces. Some had a mocking look, while some looked at him with disdain, but very few looked at him with pity. The fact that Jian Chen was a cultivation cripple had long ceased to be a secret within the clan, and so even the guards that patrolled the mansion had started to look at him differently.But Jian Chen turned a blind eye towards them. His stomach was growling from hunger, and so Jian Chen had decided with a small sigh that it was time to head towards the kitchens.It had been a long time since he had accompanied his mother to the dining halls to eat together. Nowadays, he would go to the kitchens himself to eat breakfast, and would only eat lunch and dinner together with his mother and some of his aunts.When Jian Chen reached the kitchens, over a hundred servants could be seen running about. The kitchen was a tremendous mess due to the stove where it stood like a smoking hot steamer basket.\u201cOh! Isn\u2019t this the fourth master? The fourth master has come to the kitchens! Ai, this isn\u2019t the proper place for someone as pampered as fourth master to be. The kitchens are for lowly servants like us, so why have you come here?\u201d The teasing voice of a 20 year old servant came calling out. Judging by his odd tone of voice, it was clear to tell that he was mocking Jian Chen.Another voice continued straight after the first servant, \u201cIf my guess is correct, then fourth master came down to the kitchens to get some steamed buns. But that\u2019s weird, why isn\u2019t the fourth master eating at the dining halls with the rest of the clan? Has he wronged himself and so wanted to eat the steamed buns from the kitchens? These steamed buns are only fit for us lowly servants and guards to eat however.\u201d Another 30 year old servant continued to sneer at Jian Chen.Upon hearing the two people talk, the other servants in the kitchen all started to look at the spectacle. Both of these servants had the support of some of the superiors; for example, the 20 year old servant was not only introduced by Changyang Ba\u2019s first wife Ling Long, but he was also the servant of Jian Chen\u2019s eldest aunt. Rumors had it that Ling Long had hired him because he was a family relative, but because his body had lacked the power, he could only work in the kitchens.As for the 30 year old servant that spoke second, his brother is the group leader of the Changyang mansion guards.Hearing the two servants mock him, Jian Chen could only narrow his eyes slightly as anger flashed through his eyes. Biting back any sort of rebuke, he moved towards the giant steamer basket and held his hand out to take off the lid of it before all of a sudden, two giants hands came out of nowhere and quickly moved the steamer basket away from him.\u201cI should really bring these steamed buns to the guards right away, our honored guards haven\u2019t yet eaten breakfast yet after all.\u201d Whisking away the basket, the servant muttered out loud as he exited from the kitchens, \u201cWhat a crying shame, the fourth lady gave birth to a good for nothing cripple.\u201dAt that last remark, Jian Chen went rigid. At last, the anger within his heart had finally broke free! Without saying a word, his legs blurred as both of his legs stamped across the ground. Reaching the servant with the steamer basket within a few seconds, he raised one fist and brought it down onto the servant\u2019s back!\u201cBang!\u201dCompletely caught off guard, the servant carrying the steamer basket was sent staggering to the ground. The basket he had carried dropped to the floor and with a great big smash, the nice and plump steamed buns scattered across the floor in four directions one by one.Everyone in the kitchen stared at this unforeseen event with a shocked look. Seeing where Jian Chen now stood, no one could believe what they saw. No one had saw clearly how fast or even when Jian Chen had moved. For the 7 year old fourth master to have brought down the 30 year old servant with a single punch to his knees, it was inconceivable. Although the steamer basket had been dropped and the food wasted, everyone was still amazed by this show in front of them.\u201cHahaha, Brother Qiu Er Lao, you really amaze me. Even though you are an expert that has reached the 3rd layer of Saint Force, yet you were knocked down by the fist of a little child! Did you waste too much energy with a girl last night to become this weak?\u201d Looking at the servant at the ground, the first servant who had made fun of Jian Chen was now roaring with laughter at the second servant.The servant called Qiu Er crawled up from the ground, his eyes burning with fury towards Jian Chen as the words of his younger servant friend reached his ears. For a 7 year old child to push him down to the ground, especially a child that was a cripple in the ways of cultivation, this was the ultimate form of humiliation and shame for him. After all, although he had not yet condensed his Saint Force into a Saint Weapon, he was still a practitioner that had reached a level far above that of the cripple!Shaking his head in rage, Qiu Er had forgotten in that moment that Jian Chen still held the status of being the fourth master. With a snarl, he jumped towards where Jian Chen stood and sent a punch towards his stomach.Watching Qiu Er\u2019s fist get closer, Jian Chen had a look of disdain on his face. To him, this punch that he had thrown out was full of mistakes and openings, and so he dodged by moving to the side very slightly to avoid the fist. Throwing himself forward, Jian Chen\u2019s right leg arced in a beautiful way and kicked Qiu Er firmly on the nose.\u201cAh!\u201dQiu Er let loose a blood curling scream as his clasped his bloody nose with his hands. Even then, a small steady flow of blood leaked through his hands. Jian Chen\u2019s leg had not been merciful, Qiu Er\u2019s nose had been kicked in and broke. The acute pain in his face had already drained it of color.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: Revealed StrengthQiu Er looked at Jian Chen with obvious anger in his eyes, making it seem as if he was a wild beast that wanted to take Jian Chen down.\u201cYou little bastard, I\u2019m going to teach you a lesson today!\u201d Qiu Er roared angrily. He dashed towards Jian Chen and sent a kick towards his head. The kick was fairly fast, and if it connected, it definitely would not result in a small wound for any normal person. But since Jian Chen was still in the body of a child, a direct hit from such a strong kick had a high chance of killing him.Assessing the strength of Qiu Er\u2019s kick, the 20 year old servant\u2019s face suddenly lost its humorous expression and became pale. Shouting out in alarm, he cried, \u201cBrother Qiu Er, stop!\u201d Jian Chen was still the fourth master as well as the son of Changyang Ba despite being a cripple, he still had some degree of respect around the Changyang Mansion. It was barely okay to mock him, but to raise a hand against the fourth master was unforgivable. Even if they had the support of any of the elders they would still incur a terrible punishment upon them.Seeing the intensity of Qiu Er\u2019s kick, Jian Chen\u2019s face changed as well. His eyes grew cold as he leaned to the side again. Calmly staying outside the reach of Qiu Er\u2019s kick, he didn\u2019t retreat. Instead Jian Chen rapidly approached Qiu Er\u2019s body, he placed his arm on Qiu Er\u2019s still outstretched thigh while the other hand went to the other thigh. With a low growl, Jian Chen released all of the Saint Force he had stored in his body into his waist and surprisingly lifted the over a hundred pound Qiu Er above his tiny body.Raising Qiu Er\u2019s body, Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother giving him time to retaliate, both his legs began to move across the ground as Jian Chen threw the heavy body of Qiu Er forward.Qiu Er\u2019s body flew over 5 meters before slamming into a table meant for cutting vegetables. Coincidentally, underneath his falling body was a stack of iron skewers, falling down onto that would make him resemble a bizarre human porcupine.Qiu Er fell on top of the skewers, and at least an inch of skin had been pierced through by them. Immediately, Qiu Er screamed in pain as the skin of his body was distorted and the pain in his nose was still piercing through his mind.Every servant in the kitchen suddenly came to a standstill from the unbelievable event they had just watched. A single 7 year old not only fought back against a heavyweight person like Qiu Er, but he even defeated that person, who had reached the 3rd layer of Saint Force. If news of this got out, no one in the Changyang clan would be able to believe it.Jian Chen looked at Qiu Er\u2019s suffering with cold eyes while making a mocking face at him. He didn\u2019t say anything, and decided to leave the kitchen instead, without taking even a single steamed bun with him.After exiting the kitchens, Jian Chen slowly exhaled. He didn\u2019t think that even the servants in the kitchens would begin to mock the fourth master.Throwing away the depression from his heart, Jian Chen began to stroll around the Changyang Mansion once more. With the mansion being so vast, Jian Chen had never once seen the entirety of it. Even the scenery around the place was nice to look at, as gardens surrounded every inch of the outside yards. There were many lakes as well as flower gardens that had very rare specimens that could not be seen anywhere else and they carried a sweet fragrance.As the fourth master of the Changyang clan, Jian Chen was free to wander wherever he wanted. As he wandered to and fro, he would come across important roadways and buildings that had many experts concealed everywhere. When he saw those experts however, he had decided to think no more about it; after all, he knew that the Changyang clan is one of the four great clans of Lore City. Lore City was was a First Class City, so the title of being a big clan was a prestigious one.As he walked, he had unconsciously came to the middle of a calm flower garden. Jian Chen had not noticed that his third brother Changyang Ke had been carrying a wooden axe as he trained within the same flower garden. However, in the eyes of a battle hardened Jian Chen, it looked as if Changyang Ke was just recklessly swinging the axe around with no particular style in mind at all.Although Jian Chen had studied the way of the sword in the past world, he had studied many different axe wielding experts and how they fought. So even Jian Chen was familiar with how one should use an axe, but the way Changyang Ke was handling it, Jian Chen was speechless. How could this be considered training?Just as Jian Chen was about to turn around to leave, Changyang Ke noticed him out of the corner of his eye. Slowly ceasing his movements, Changyang Ke\u2019s face started to show signs of ill intent as he smiled.\u201cFourth brother, come on over, your third brother has some candy for you to eat.\u201d Changyang Ke cried out to Jian Chen.Hearing Changyang Ke\u2019s words, Jian Chen nearly tripped down onto the ground in disbelief. Secretly thinking to himself, he thought, \u201cEven a 7 year old wouldn\u2019t fall for such a line.\u201d However, Jian had forgot to account for that aside from the experiences of his past world, he was still no better than a 7 year old child.But he paid no mind to the words of Changyang Ke and continued to keep on walking without even turning his head back.Seeing that Jian Chen was getting farther and farther away, Changyang Ke began to get angry. Throwing the wooden axe in his hands to the ground, he dashed towards Jian Chen and eventually caught up to him.\u201cFourth brother, did you not hear me just now?\u201d Changyang Ke blocked Jian Chen\u2019s path like a cork in a bottle, his face red with anger as he stared at Jian Chen.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Jian Chen looked at Changyang Ke with a calm gaze while implying a hint of coldness in his question. Jian Chen did not harbor any good sentiments towards his third brother. In the past two years, Changyang Ke would always look for some way to bully Jian Chen, and ever since the news of Jian Chen being a cripple, his actions became much more severe. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Jian Chen rarely went outside, the amount of times Changyang Ke bullied Jian Chen would have been increased tenfold. However, every time he had tried to bully Jian Chen, it would always result in failure and sometimes Jian Chen would also find a way to bully him back. This had created a sense of resentment within Changyang Ke\u2019s heart which made him seek revenge even more.\u201cFourth brother, come accompany your third brother in practicing some martial arts.\u201d While talking, Changyang Ke had already started dragging Jian Chen towards the place where he practiced and did not give Jian Chen a chance to respond. Changyang Ke was actually very excited at the moment, for although he was not a match for Jian Chen when comparing their intelligence, he did not think he would be weaker than Jian Chen in terms of strength. After all, his fourth brother was a cripple in terms of martial cultivation and could not even cultivate any Saint Force, in Changyang Ke\u2019s mind, this was the perfect opportunity to exact his revenge.Not long after Jian Chen had been forcefully dragged by Changyang Ke to where he was practicing his martial arts, Changyang Ke picked up the wooden axe he had thrown to the side earlier and then said to Jian Chen, \u201cThird Brother, are you ready? I am going to start attacking now.\u201dSeeing Changyang Ke\u2019s gentle smile, Jian Chen let a hint of playfulness appear within his eyes. Holding both of his palms in a clueless manner, he asked, \u201cThird Brother, you have a weapon in your hands, don\u2019t tell me you want me to fight against you barehanded?\u201dHearing his brother talk, Changyang Ke looked distracted for a second. Looking at the wooden axe in his own hands, he hesitated only for a second before tossing it towards Jian Chen, as he said, \u201cThen I shall give you the axe fourth brother, and I will be the one that will fight bare handed.\u201d Although the axe was wooden, it was still 10 pounds. Even for a 10 year old child, swinging this around would prove to be difficult. Changyang Ke had thought of this and threw it towards Jian Chen for this reason. He wanted to make Jian Chen humiliate himself while he would look like the gracious one.Jian Chen took the wooden axe in front of him and started to inspect it. The axe was very crudely made, only the shape of the axe was there, while the blade of it was almost non existent. Even if he were to try to chop at a person, it would not cause significant harm. At the very most, the axe would only leave behind a sore bruise.Seeing Jian Chen hold up the 10 pound axe with ease, Changyang Ke\u2019s eyes revealed a trace of shock. He had not been expecting this change of events.Jian Chen looked at Changyang Ke and gave a faint laugh, \u201cThird brother, perhaps you should use this axe instead.\u201d Right as he spoke, he tossed the axe back at Changyang Ke.Catching the axe he had only just thrown at Jian Chen, Changyang Ke began to feel suspicious, \u201cFourth brother, could it be you still wanted to fight me bare handed?\u201dJian Chen began to laugh as he shook his head. Grabbing a nearby tree, he snapped off a branch one meter long. Shaving away the little twigs and leaves, Jian Chen was left with only a single branch.\u201cThis will be my weapon!\u201d Raising the branch, Jian Chen laughed gently.Changyang Ke looked at the tiny stick that could be quickly turned into chopsticks in Jian Chen\u2019s hand and laughed. He was no longer angry as the day that he would be able to beat Jian Chen with ease seemed to be getting closer and closer. The dream of being able to bully Jian Chen without taking any losses had finally come for Changyang Ke. This would make him extremely happy.Changyang Ke clasped onto the axe firmly, \u201cThen fourth brother, you\u2019d best be careful. Your third brother will begin to attack!\u201d Right after saying it, Changyang Ke immediately stormed towards Jian Chen with the axe held in both his hands before trying to bring it down onto Jian Chen.This axe wasn\u2019t able to inflict a fatal wound, so Changyang Ke didn\u2019t bother to hold back and swung with all his might.Jian Chen\u2019s legs crossed forward each other as he dodged the axe. Swinging his tree branch with frightening speed, the branch had suddenly became more frightening in power. Even Jian Chen\u2019s demeanor had changed abruptly, as he pressed forward, the normally safe branch became a deadly sword in his hands.Jian Chen was swinging the sword with unbelievable speed, leaving Changyang Ke with almost no room to counter when at last, the tree branch had already placed itself on Changyang Ke\u2019s throat.\u201cThird brother, you\u2019ve lost!\u201d With a playful banter, he returned the axe that Changyang Ke had dropped shortly in the middle of the match.Changyang Ke could only stare at the tree branch at his neck with disbelief flashing across his eyes. He had not seen the tree branch move at all, by the time his eyes had saw a sign of movement, the match had already finished.Still in shock, Changyang Ke shook his head. Grabbing the tree branch at his throat, he snapped it in two and cried out in disbelief, \u201cThat didn\u2019t count. It definitely didn\u2019t count! Fourth brother, you weren\u2019t fighting fair at all.\u201dJian Chen laughed as he looked at the red faced Changyang Ke. \u201cThird brother, you don\u2019t even know if I was fighting fair or not.\u201d He said in a strange voice.\u201cThat\u2026that is\u2026\u201d Changyang Ke scratched at his cheek and stammered as he tried to think of an excuse. In the end, he still couldn\u2019t accept the result and said, \u201cEither way, that match just now didn\u2019t count. Let\u2019s fight one more time!\u201dJian Chen gathered the pieces of the tree branch that Changyang Ke had snapped with a laugh, \u201cOkay, let us fight one more time then.\u201d Without further ado, he walked 5 meters away from Changyang Ke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: High RegardsBoth of Changyang Ke\u2019s hands clenched his axe tightly, as he attentively looked at Jian Chen. Thanks to the lesson he had just learned, he wouldn\u2019t dare to underestimate Jian Chen a second time, so in this round, Changyang Ke moved around carefully.Jian Chen began to laugh at Changyang Ke, causing him to scowl in confusion, \u201cThird brother, can we start sparring now?\u201dChangyang Ke tightly gripped his axe; this time, he used his Saint Force to help him. Once again he charged at Jian Chen, but this time he was much faster.Jian Chen casually waved around the less than half a meter long tree branch in his hands. He was feeling fantastic for some odd reason; it was almost as if the branch had some sort of secret connection with himself. At the same time, within Jian Chen\u2019s heart, he couldn\u2019t help but feel the same sensation he had in the previous world when he had been on the verge of death, where he could understand the amazing power of the Realm of the Sword God. During that moment, he had finally been able to control his sword with his \u201cSpirit\u201d, and had sent it flying 100 meters straight through Dugu Qiubai\u2019s throat.Thinking of that moment, Jian Chen sprung into action, as the tree branch in his hand was sent flying towards Changyang Ke.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dBending to Jian Chen\u2019s will, the tree branch looked as if it was alive, and flew from his hands. Flying at incredible speeds towards Changyang Ke, the tree branch was enveloped by a faint white glow of light. A strong yet acute amount of Sword Qi was emitted from the tree branch, making it look like a bolt of lightning. With a brilliant flash of light, the branch had already reached Changyang Ke\u2019s stomach.Immediately realizing the trajectory path, as well as the amount of Sword Qi on the tree branch, Jian Chen turned pale with fright. He frantically tried to stop the branch from reaching its destination. If the tree branch was not stopped, then it would have, without a doubt, pierced through Changyang Ke and kill him. Even if he wasn\u2019t immediately killed, Changyang Ke would still have suffered from a fatal wound, which would lead to a disaster for Jian Chen.Right as the branch reached Changyang Ke\u2019s stomach, it began to slow, but not before piercing into his stomach just by a small amount. Looking closer, the tree branch had merely penetrated through the skin, but if Jian Chen had been a tiniest bit slower with his command for it to stop, then Changyang Ke would had been left with the branch straight through his body. Such a thought was too horrible for Jian Chen to imagine.Wiping away the sweat on his forehead, Jian Chen noticed that there was still a thin line of his soul connected to the tree branch. Confirming once more with his soul that the branch had only pierced Changyang Ke\u2019s skin, Jian Chen let out a sigh of relief.Feeling the slight pain from his stomach, the somewhat plump Changyang Ke couldn\u2019t help but start to pale. When he looked down and saw the bloodstains on his stomach, his face changed drastically. A wail was heard as he started to cry, with teardrops falling in a never ending stream down his cheeks as if his eyes were fountains.\u201cBl..blood\u2026I\u2019m bleeding! Waaah, fourth brother, you\u2026you hit me! Waaaah, Mo\u2026Mother, I\u2019m going to tell my mother about this. Mother\u2026.fourth brother hit me\u2026!\u201d Changyang Ke immediately transformed into a child who only knew how to cry. Throwing down his wooden axe, he fled from the garden, bawling nonstop. Changyang Ke was barely 10 years old after all, he had not yet matured enough to withstand an ordeal like this.Looking at the slowly fading away Changyang Ke, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. As he walked out from the gardens by himself, he felt a small bit of fear in his heart. What type of strict punishment would he receive for this?\u2026\u2026.\u201cWhat? Chang Bai, are you playing a joke on me?\u201d In a study room, the leader of the Changyang clan, Changyang Ba stood up from his chair in surprise. Focusing his attention on the elder in front of him, Changyang Ba couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by what he had just heard.The elder that stood in front of Chanygang Ba was the housekeeper of the Changyang Clan, Chang Bai.Chang Bai nodded his head solemnly, \u201cMy lord, even I didn\u2019t believe this matter at first, but dozens of the kitchen servants all saw it clearly. The fourth master really did beat one of the servants, as well as lift up a servant who weighed 100 pounds more than him, before tossing him five meters away. The most important part is that this very same servant is of the third Saint Force layer.\u201dHearing Chang Bai, Changyang Ba\u2019s eyes widened in awe from this piece of incredible news.Chang Bai looked at the clan leader, and after some hesitation, continued to say, \u201cMy lord, I also received more information about this, but the fourth master was recently involved in a spar with the third master. Using a single tree branch, the fourth master was able to injure the third master!\u201d\u201cWhat? Xiang\u2019er and Ke Er fought, and Xiang\u2019er was the victor?\u201d With each passing second, Changyang Ba\u2019s eyes widened more and more.\u201cThat is correct my lord. The fourth master had used only a tree branch while the third master was using a wooden axe.\u201d Chang Bai added.\u201cHow is this possible!\u201d Changyang Ba flew from his chair once more, \u201cXiang\u2019er is unable to use the Saint Force, while Changyang Ke is 3 years older and is also at the third Saint Force layer. Combined with the fact that Ke Er practices martial arts everyday, how was he not able to beat Xiang\u2019er?\u201dTaking out a tree branch from within his robes, Chang Bai held it out for Changyang Ba to take, \u201cMy lord, the fourth master had used this tree branch to beat the third master.\u201dChangyang Ba took the tree branch that was no thicker than his fingers. Inspecting it over, he noticed the tip of it had been dyed with blood.Changyang Ba focused onto the dried up blood on the broken tip of the branch while concealing all sorts of emotions from his face, \u201cChang Bai, is Ke Er fine?\u201d\u201cThe third master is uninjured besides some broken skin.\u201d Chang Bai replied.Changyang Ba nodded his head slowly with a neutral face. Inspecting the tree branch even more closely, he started to grow more and more suspicious. Finally, he spoke, \u201cChang Bai, this tree branch is nothing special. In addition, the tip is not sharp at all. Based on Xian Er\u2019s strength, it is impossible for a tree branch to injure Ke Er at all.\u201dChang Bai nodded his head in agreement, his eye glistening with a single luster, \u201cMy lord, I just had an outrageous thought; what if the fourth master is not a cripple unable to cultivate Saint Force? Seeing the fourth master\u2019s display of might today, perhaps the fourth master had already cultivated Saint Force to the fourth level? There would be no other way for the fourth master to beat the third master otherwise.\u201dHearing Chang Bai, the clan leader\u2019s face grew bright with emotion. To treat his son who was regarded as a genius badly after being revealed as a cripple, this was Changyang Ba\u2019s biggest regret.\u201cChang Bai, what you\u2019re saying is that Xiang\u2019er is not only able to use Saint Force, but that he is actually a genius at it as well.\u201d Changyang Ba\u2019s voice began to tremble with emotion. For a 7 year old to reach the fourth layer of Saint Force, this could only be accomplished by geniuses of the Tian Yuan continent. On average, by the time someone reached the fourth layer of Saint Force, they would be ** years old.TL Note: Raws say **Chang Bai nodded his head, \u201cI have watched fourth master grow up since he was a child. He is an outstanding genius in my eyes, and I believe in him. I can tell that the fourth master will be able to surpass even me in the future .\u201dChangyang Ba started to tremble and shake as he listened, his eyes expressing rapt excitement and minor disbelief.Chang Bai continued to speak, \u201cBack when the fourth master was revealed to be a cripple unable to cultivate Saint Force, I had found it quite strange. I had always found this situation to be fishy, but I couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what was off until today. With the fourth master\u2019s two displays of strength today, I\u2019m finally able to confirm my suspicions; the fourth master was never a cripple, but indeed a genius of cultivation.\u201dChangyang Ba deeply inhaled to calm down his increasing heart rate, but before he could say anything more, a clans member came running in and said to him respectfully, \u201cMy lord, the third master has been injured. The third lady wishes for the lord to come visit right away.\u201d\u201cI understand, you may leave.\u201d Changyang Ba waved his hand, dismissing the clan member indifferently.\u201cYes my lord!\u201d The clan member bowed respectfully before slowly exiting.Changyang Ba looked back at the housekeeper, \u201cChang Bai, it would be best if we head on over while checking up on Xiang\u2019er. He has been neglected for so long after all.\u201d After he had spoke, he immediately paused gravely. \u201cChang Bai, the two servants that dared to bully Xiang\u2019er in the kitchen, I\u2019ll leave it to you to drive them away from my mansion. Hmph, those two lowly servants, to think that they could bully Changyang Ba\u2019s son without consequences.\u201dChang Bai laughed briefly, \u201cMy lord, those two servants have already long since been driven off. Although one of them was introduced by the first lady Ling Long, the other servant\u2019s older brother is the leader of one of the team captains of the patrol guards. But since they dared to bully the fourth master, they no longer have any reason to stay behind in this mansion. Otherwise, I would not dare to show face around the Changyang Mansion ever again.\u201d\u2026\u2026In a largely decorated room, the recently injured Changyang Ke lay on the bed. With a pale face, he stared at the freshly bandaged wound on his stomach.Sitting at the edge of the bed was Changyang Ke\u2019s mother Yu Feng Han, with a look of distress as she tended to her son. Not too far away, Jian Chen and his mother Bi Yuntian, as well as first aunt Ling Long, second aunt Bai Yushuang, and second sister Changyang Mingyue all stood around the bed.Yu Feng Han looked back at Bi Yuntian with an angry look, \u201cFourth sister, your treasured son is getting more and more outrageous. To have assaulted my Ke Er with such a dangerous weapon; it\u2019s a good thing my Ke Er is very strong and didn\u2019t suffer a deadly wound. Otherwise, who knows how this might have gone?\u201dJian Chen scowled as he listened to her, not accepting her words even a tiny bit, \u201cThis can\u2019t be blamed on me, it was third brother who had asked me to spar with him. A small injury like this is unavoidable. Besides, I was not using a dangerous weapon, but a tree branch. If anyone is to blame, then it is third brother\u2019s lack of skill.\u201dYu Feng Han\u2019s face went ashen at Jian Chen\u2019s remarks; what he had said made perfect sense and she could not refute them in any way.Just thinking about how she had been outspoken against by a mere child, an unholy rage rose up within her. Along with the words, \u201cIf anyone is to blame, then it is third brother\u2019s lack of skill.\u201d, Yu Feng Han\u2019s face went from green to white in rapid succession. These words meant that her son was no stronger than a cripple who could not even cultivate Saint Force at all.Hearing that Yu Feng Han be beaten by a child, Bai Yushuang could not help but laugh merrily, while Ling Long sat there with an expressionless face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: Kargath AcademyBi Yuntian held Jian Chen\u2019s head in a loving way as she slowly walked forward, \u201cThird sister, this was only some playful sparring between kids; not something we should worry about. It\u2019s pointless to get angry; in the end, the two of them are just children after all. Right now, we should instead concentrate on healing Ke Er\u2019s wounds.\u201dAt the words of Bi Yuntian, despite still being quite mad, all Yu Feng Han could do was fume silently. She was afraid that if she continued to nag everyone about the acts of such small children, her three sisters would begin to see her in a darker light.Bi Yuntian walked up to where Changyang Ke reclined, closed her eyes and brought her two hands over the boys wounds. Her hands hovered there for a moment before letting off a faint white glow.At that moment, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes sparkled with interest. He could clearly sense that a special power was gradually gathering in his mother\u2019s hands, forming that faint white glow. Moreover, this type of special power was the exact same power that he was able to contain inside the ball he had made earlier.Jian Chen began to pay close attention to his mother\u2019s movements, and in doing so he suddenly realized that he was actually unsure if he was able to understand the very same method his mother was using to manipulate the energy. After all, he had discovered ages ago that this ability to integrate the strength of the world was complicated.The white glow in Bi Yuntian\u2019s hands grew stronger and stronger, yet the light never hurt one\u2019s eyes. After a few deep breaths, she flicked her arms and the milky white light left her hands and floated down to Changyang Ke\u2019s stomach, slowly merging with the wound there. The white bandages that were already there obstructed Jian Chen\u2019s view of what exactly the white ball of energy was doing, and what changes were occurring.After completing her task, Bi Yuntian let out a deep breath, \u201cThird sister, Changyang Ke is fine, his injuries should be nonexistent now.\u201dA happy smile finally appeared on Yu Feng Han\u2019s face. She thanked Bi Yuntian briefly before quickly stepping over to Changyang Ke\u2019s bedside. She gave a concerned look towards her son and asked, \u201cKe Er, how are you feeling? Does your wound still hurt?\u201dChangyang Ke raised his hand to rub at his stomach area, and laughed before starting to tear at his bandages, \u201cMother, your son is all right now. It\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d.After the bandages fell off, it was clear that the wound on Changyang Ke\u2019s stomach was nowhere to be seen. Only a small bloody scar remained, but other than that, the wound had ceased to exist.Upon seeing this, Jian Chen suddenly understood. This type of mysterious energy was the unique energy that belonged to Radiant Saints. Their energy had a special healing effect that could heal any injury, no matter how grave. Under the care of a Radiant Saint, any wound would be healed rapidly. Since his own mother was a Radiant Saint, she was able to use this healing power. Legends said that some very strong Radiant Saints were able to regrow someone\u2019s arm, as well as having the power to resurrect the dead!Inside Jian Chen\u2019s head, he had a secret thought: If he was able to understand and absorb the energy of the Radiant Saint, then he may be able to be like his mother, and have the same amount of control a Radiant Saint had to heal wounds.As he had this thought, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel impatient, and wanted to test it out. However, in the end he still endured the temptation, since his current situation was not appropriate for experimenting.At that moment, the doors to the room opened wide. Jian Chen glanced at the people who walked in together; it was his father, Changyang Ba, and the Changyang clan\u2019s housekeeper, Chang Bai.\u201cHow is Ke Er, his injuries are not that severe are they?\u201d Changyang Ba asked with a voice of concern.\u201cI thank my lord for his concern, but fourth sister has already healed him, so Ke Er is fine now.\u201d Yu Feng Han\u2019s face showed a hint of a smile. Changyang Ba was showing some concern for his son, so she felt happy.\u201cThen everything is fine now! Changyang Ba nodded his head and looked at Jian Chen, \u201cXiang\u2019er, how have these past few days been treating you?\u201d Even when talking to Jian Chen, some concern was being shown as well.\u201cI thank father for his concerns, your son has been doing very well.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s voice was very even. Ever since the end of the Saint Test, this was the first time Changyang Ba and Jian Chen had talked to each other.Hearing Jian Chen\u2019s voice sound so clipped with a sense of detachment, Changyang Ba couldn\u2019t help but sigh to himself secretly. \u201cXiang\u2019er, come accompany your father to the study room.\u201d Changyang Ba then turned around to exit from the room.In a flash, Jian Chen followed Changyang Ba and Chang Bai into the study room. Sitting down on a chair, Changyang Ba stared at Jian Chen for a moment, before asking him, \u201cXiang\u2019er, I have heard that earlier this morning, you injured Qiu Er of the kitchen servants this morning.\u201d\u201cThat is true!\u201d Jian Chen had already realized that his true strength had already been revealed, so there was no point in trying to hide it.Changyang Ba\u2019s eyes had a cheerful expression as he laughed and said gently, \u201cXiang\u2019er, why don\u2019t you tell your father, can you already cultivate Saint Force?\u201dJian Chen nodded his head faintly and answered as neutrally as before, \u201cYes!\u201d He knew that there was no way he could conceal this fact, so he admitted it with straightforward answer.Although he already could guess that Jian Chen could cultivate Saint Force, hearing the confirmation from Jian Chen\u2019s own mouth made Changyang Ba feel even more emotional.\u201cChang Bai, may I trouble you to test Xiang\u2019er\u2019s Saint Force again?\u201d Changyang Ba was happy now, but he still spoke to Chang Bai politely, not at all having an attitude of the clan master asking for a housekeeper to do something.But Chang Bai only laughed, and brought the hand with his Space Ring up, causing the Saint Stone to once more appear right in front of Jian Chen\u2019s eyes. \u201cFourth master, please put your hand on top of the stone!\u201d He said in a warm tone.The moment Jian Chen put his hand on the Saint Stone, Chang Bai also activated it. In that instant, Jian Chen once again felt that mysterious power being emitted from the Saint Stone, entering his body through his arms. Within him, the power roamed around in a circle, before finally returning back to the Saint Stone. At the same time, the only thing that could be seen was the entire Saint Stone suddenly emitting a faint red glow.Seeing the Saint Stone glow red, Changyang Ba\u2019s face showed an excited expression. Even Chang Bai now had a faint smile, and he looked at Jian Chen with a gratified look in his eyes.\u201cClan leader, based on the strength of the glow, fourth master has already reached the fourth Saint Force layer.\u201d Chang Bai said with a faint smile.\u201cThe fourth layer\u2026the fourth layer\u2026\u201d Changyang Ba gradually stood up from his chair, and in excitement, he wrung his hands together. Before this, he had already guessed such a result, but it had only been a guess. Now that he knew the actual situation, he felt a new feeling in his heart.Jian Chen had already reached the fourth Saint Force layer at the age of seven. Perhaps this level was not very outstanding compared to the entire Tian Yuan Continent, but within Gesun Kingdom, this was enough to qualify as a first class genius. Moreover, his third brother, Changyang Ke, was three years older than Jian Chen, and yet his inner Saint Force power had just reached the fourth layer.Chang Bai once again placed the Saint Stone within his Space Ring. With a gratified look, he smiled, \u201cFourth master, you really have not disappointed me.\u201dChangyang Ba quickly calmed down, and glanced at Jian Chen in a completely transformed light. His eyes were now filled with surprise, excitement, and gratitude.By the time Jian Chen left the study room, it was already almost noon. Right after Jian Chen left, Changyang Ba looked at Chang Bai, and with a slightly doubtful tone he said, \u201cChang Bai, since Xiang\u2019er has Saint Force, then how come last time he was tested, it wasn\u2019t detected? It had even scared me into thinking that Xian Er was a cripple that could was not able to cultivate Saint Force.\u201dChang Bai furrowed his brows, and after pondering for a bit, slowly said, \u201cI\u2019m not completely sure either. Perhaps the last Saint Test malfunctioned somehow. However, this is no longer of any importance!\u201dChangyang Ba nodded, \u201cCurrently, Xiang\u2019er is only around seven years old, and he has already reached the fourth Saint Force level. If this continues, I predict that the latest that Xiang\u2019er will break through the tenth Saint Force level is by the age of eighteen and condense his Saint Force into a Saint Weapon. Moreover, Xiang\u2019er has always been an outstanding genius since he was young, so I want to quickly send him to Kargath Academy to study. What does Chang Bai think?\u201dHearing these words, Chang Bai pondered for a bit, then replied, \u201cKargath Academy is the most famous academy in our Gesun Kingdom. However, the threshold to enter the academy is high. The person\u2019s strength must have reached the eighth Saint Force level, and his or her age cannot be over eighteen. If clan leader wants to quickly send fourth master to Kargath Academy, I\u2019m afraid that is impossible in such a short period of time. Although the fourth master has already reached the fourth Saint Force level, the distance to the eighth Saint Force level will most likely take quite a long time. After all, the higher the Saint Force level, the harder it is to raise.\u201d\u201cI hope that Xiang\u2019er can quickly train to the eighth Saint Force level within the next few years.\u201d Changyang Ba said softly.Chang Bai smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, clan leader. I believe that fourth master will reach the eighth Saint Force layer sooner or later. The only issue is time, since just now, when I assessed fourth master, I discovered that fourth master\u2019s Saint Force wasn\u2019t far from reaching the fifth layer.\u201dHearing these words, Changyang Ba was unable to contain his joy, as he mumbled, \u201cI hope that Xiang\u2019er will really surpass Chang Bai in the future, and become the clan\u2019s pillar of support.\u201dChang Bai stood on the side, smiling wordlessly. However, his eyes did not at all hide his expression of anticipation.\u2026\u2026.After leaving the study room, Jian Chen immediately ran quickly back to his own room. He tightly closed his door, and he recalled the entire frightening scene of his fight with Changyang Ke.Although Jian Chen knew that during his fight with Dugu Qiubai in his previous world, he had made a breakthrough and entered the Realm of the Sword God, but he didn\u2019t dare think that after his reincarnation he would still be able to accomplish it. Just thinking about that remarkable ability sent Jian Chen into a spiral of joy and excitement.But when Jian Chen thought back to when the tree branch had mysteriously emitted Sword Qi, he started to feel some doubt. He no longer had the same strength he had from the previous world, so how was it possible for him to control an ordinary tree branch with the same Sword Qi?As he contemplated this, Jian Chen decided to give it a try once more. Scanning the room, his eyes noticed a nearby wooden clothes rack. Snapping off a 2 foot wooden strip, Jian Chen would use it as a makeshift sword.Holding the two foot wooden strip, Jian Chen slowly entered a state of tranquility. Deep in his mind, Jian Chen slowly began to convince himself that the wooden strip in his hand was not a wooden strip, but a sword instead. A sword for a god, a sword for a god that could overcome anything. Slowly as he harmonized with it, he could feel the grains in his hands, and see them very clearly within his own head so well, he could even understand their internal compositions.Sucking a deep breath, he tried to quell the feelings of emotions within his heart. Taking hold of his emotions, the item in his hand flew into the air.Right as Jian Chen\u2019s mind had reached this state, he had already established a connection between the wooden strip and his spirit. As the wooden strip separated from his hand, it floated by itself in midair while still being under Jian Chen\u2019s control. It slowly inched forward before emitting a white ray of light, revealing the sharp Sword Qi he was familiar with.At this moment, Jian Chen had realized his soul had completely harmonized with the wooden strip, to the point that it had felt like his own arm that could easily be controlled with his will. At the same time, he had realized that the Sword Qi in the wooden strip had something to do with his soul.With that realization, Jian Chen could only see a bright ray of light coming from the hovering wooden strip and flew around his body with a speed so fast, even Jian Chen couldn\u2019t see it clearly.Jian Chen\u2019s heart pulsed quickly as his face revealed a look of extreme joy. He had not thought that the final moment of his life in the previous world would he be able to understand the Sword\u2019s Soul.From that day on, the remarkable ability of the Sword\u2019s Soul was not only Jian Chen\u2019s strongest attack, but also a skill that could save his life.Unknowingly, a few years passed. The current Jian Chen was already fifteen years old. During these past few years, Jian Chen had rarely gone outside, and spent every day in his room training the Azulet Sword Law. His strength had already been revealed, and he had even been recognized as a cultivating genius. Thus, his position in the Changyang household had changed; there was no longer a single person in the household that dared to look down on him. Moreover, Changyang Ba had been extremely caring to Jian Chen in pretty much every possible way. Among this, the happiest one was Bi Yuntian. Originally, her son that was deemed as a cripple unable to cultivate, but now he had transformed into a cultivating genius, especially since he had reached the fourth Saint Force layer at the age of seven. Anyone could imagine how happy Bi Yuntian was about her son being extraordinary.However, Jian Chen discovered that since he had revealed his true strength, his eldest aunt Ling Long and third aunt Yu Feng Han seemed to always look at him with an unfriendly expression. This situation was one that the Jian Chen with memories of his previous life was well aware of.Within the past few years, Jian Chen had already reached the eighth Saint Force layer. Moreover, this was only because Jian Chen had purposely slowed down his pace. That was because during the past few years, Jian Chen had used almost half the time to familiarize himself with the sword laws from his previous world. Otherwise, he most likely would have broken through the eighth level ages ago. Because of this, Jian Chen was currently not far from reaching the ninth layer already.Right now, within the Changyang household, Jian Chen\u2019s strength had already well surpassed his second sister Changyang Mingyue, and his third brother Changyang Ke. Although Changyang Mingyue was over three years older than Jian Chen, her Saint Force had stopped at the seventh layer. As for Changyang Ke, he had never really had any talent for cultivating, and his current seventeen year old self had only achieved the fifth Saint Force layer after much difficulty.In the early morning, a large group of people gathered outside the great hall. Amongst this group were Jian Chen\u2019s parents, his three aunts, and even his third brother, Changyang Ke, and his second sister, Changyang Mingyue. Aside from them, a few of Changyang household\u2019s chief figures were also present. There was also a bird-type magical beast about 3 meters large that calmly sat on the ground, not too far from the crowd of people.Today was the day that Jian Chen would leave for Kargath Academy to study. The minimum standard to enter Kargath Academy was having achieved the eighth level. In addition, the person\u2019s age could not be over eighteen. Currently, Jian Chen met both of these standards. Moreover, today happened to also be the enrolling general assembly for Kargath Academy that only occurred once a year.Bi Yuntian\u2019s face was covered in tears as she looked at Jian Chen. With a loving gaze, she said, \u201cXiang\u2019er, you have to study diligently at the academy. Try to stay out of trouble, understand?\u201d Bi Yuntian spoke with a tone filled with deep concern.Jian Chen obediently nodded, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mother, I know what I should do.\u201dChangyang Ba walked up to Jian Chen, and said, \u201cXiang\u2019er, this Space Belt is something Father prepared especially for you. Although it isn\u2019t anything priceless, and the amount of space inside isn\u2019t very large, it can still store some small things. If you break through the tenth level by the time you turn eighteen and condense your Saint Force into a Saint Weapon, then Father will reward you with a Space Ring and a Monster Core.\u201d While speaking, a very exquisite belt had already appeared in his hands. Seeing the size of the belt, it was obvious that it had been specifically tailored for Jian Chen.Seeing Changyang Ba be so concerned about Jian Chen, Linglong and Fenyan, who were standing nearby, couldn\u2019t help but show a trace of deep jealousy and dissatisfaction. However, currently, everyone\u2019s gazes were gathered on Jian Chen, and nobody had noticed them.Jian Chen accepted the belt, and said with a strong self-confidence, \u201cFather, I will definitely become a Saint soon.\u201dChangyang Ba expressed a trace of a smile, and he looked at Jian Chen with a gaze full of gratification.\u201cFourth master, it\u2019s getting late. We should go on our way.\u201d At that moment, the housekeeper Chang Bai that was standing on the side, spoke up.Jian Chen gave one final glance at his mother, and then walked over to Chang Bai without once turning his back, and said, \u201cChang Bai, let\u2019s leave.\u201dChang Bai reached out and lifted Jian Chen onto the back of the flying magical beast. Afterwards, he jumped on as well, sitting next to Jian Chen. Faintly smiling at Jian Chen, he said, \u201cFourth master, sit tight please.\u201dAfterwards, he only saw Chang Bai pat the magical beast\u2019s back. In an instant, the flying magical beast seemed to have received a command, and stretched out its 10 meter long wings to fly up. It directly rose up into the air, and began to quickly fly off into the distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12: Big Brother Changyang HuSitting on top of the flying magical beast, Jian Chen\u2019s face did not reveal any sort of emotion, even though they were flying at an extreme speed 1000 feet high up into the air. Since the beast was flying at such high speeds, he could hear a ceaseless rumbling sound from the wind in his ears.Looking at Jian Chen\u2019s passive face, Chang Bai couldn\u2019t help but nod in approval. Most children generally paled in extreme fear after flying on top of a magical beast for the first time. Some children trembled in fear the whole time, while a smaller amount even wet themselves, but very few people had achieved the same tranquility as Jian Chen.Chang Bai thought back to when he had sent Changyang Hu to Kargath Academy a few years back. After sitting on the flying beast, Changyang Hu\u2019s entire body had shivered from fright as he grabbed hold of the feathers on the beast\u2019s neck.\u201cThe fourth master does not seem to be like the others; it truly makes one wonder what sort of accomplishments he will succeed in the future.\u201d Chang Bai thought to himself.Jian Chen stared at the flying magical beast below him and asked, \u201cChang Bai, what kind of beast is this, to be flying at such a fast speed?\u201d\u201cThis is only natural!\u201d Chang Bai spoke in a majestic voice, \u201cFourth master, you shouldn\u2019t underestimate this magical beast. This magical beast is called the Eagle Beast; it is a Class 4 magical beast which is the equivalent of a Great Saint Master. It can fly through the sky at extremely fast speeds, and even though it is barely Class 4, even someone of the same rank of Earth Saint Master would not be able to fight it when it is in the sky.\u201d\u201cThen that would mean this Eagle Beast is very expensive.\u201d Jian Chen said.Chang Bai nodded, \u201cThat is natural as well. Flying magical beasts are very expensive; not only because they are hard to capture, but hard to tame as well. Even though flying magical beasts are the fastest way of transportation, riding on one is very dangerous. In the case that a magical beast goes out of control, then the rider will be sent falling from thousands of meters in the air. Even with the power of an Earth Saint Master, surviving a fall like that would be unlikely and even if you\u2019re lucky, you will still end up with a fatal injury. Even if it\u2019s a Class 1 or 2 flying magical beast, its price is still very expensive, especially if it has a berserk nature or won\u2019t submit to a human. Therefore, taming a flying magical beast is a very challenging task to accomplish.\u201dJian Chen nodded his head before slowly becoming silent once more.Chang Bai looked at the silent Jian Chen and said, \u201cFourth master, your older brother Changyang Hu is also at Kargath Academy. It has been a few years already, so becoming a Saint isn\u2019t too far away for him. If you ever come across a problem at the academy, don\u2019t be afraid to ask your older brother to help solve it.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Jian Chen replied. But his mind felt complicated when he thought of his mysterious older brother. Jian Chen had never seen him before, and he didn\u2019t even know what his brother\u2019s personality was like. He was also very worried about if his older brother would be jealous about his innate skill at cultivating Saint Force, like third brother Changyang Ke was. Being jealous over something like this was not at all uncommon within a big clan. In the previous world, Jian Chen had met all sorts of family strife due to a power struggle between siblings during his time as a traveler.In Jian Chen\u2019s heart, he desperately hoped that such a situation would not happen to him. In his previous world, he was an orphan who had never experienced any sort of familial love. Since the heavens had blessed him with a family this time, he treasured it deeply.After the Eagle Beast flew for half the day at an extremely high speed, it finally arrived at Kargath Academy, where under Chang Bai\u2019s control, it descended to a mere 100 meters above ground.Kargath Academy was established within the plains, with a great wall 10 meters high surrounding it. The academy was extraordinarily big, and the lands it covered were vast as well. Even though Jian Chen was hovering 100 meters above ground, he still couldn\u2019t see the entire academy.Kargath Academy was the most prestigious academy in the Gesun Kingdom, and today was its annual opening ceremony. For that reason, the front gates were extremely lively. There were many people there, as well as a few luxurious carriages that were parked not too far away. However, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t put names to the types of magical beasts that were pulling the carriages. Virtually every carriage had a few guards protecting them.In the skies, a few flying magical beasts approached them, descending down onto the academy courtyards. Each of them carried a small child.Chang Bai instructed the Eagle Beast to fly down towards the courtyards as well, landing them right next to a 100 meter tall tower. He brought Jian Chen directly into the tower. Outside, there were still quite a few flying magical beasts resting there,Jian Chen and Chang Bai walked to the top of the tower to meet the headmaster of Kargath Academy. The headmaster was not that much different in age than Chang Bai, and Jian Chen had a feeling that the two had some sort of familiarity between them.Because of this familiarity, Jian Chen could easily enter the academy without any problems. Under the instructions of the headmaster, Jian Chen\u2019s brother Changyang Hu had been called up to the top of the tower as well, allowing him to see the mysterious older brother he had never met before.Changyang Hu was already 18 years old, the same age as his second sister Changyang Mingyue, but Changyang Mingyue was younger by 3 months.Changyang Hu was a fairly sturdy teenager who was taller than Jian Chen, and he wore the academy uniform. He had already been enrolled in the academy for over 2 years, and his Saint Force had also reached the peak of the 10th layer. However, he had not yet condensed it into a Saint Weapon.The distance between the peak of the 10th layer and Sainthood was not big at all, but the moment in between was very important, as condensing the Saint Force into a Saint Weapon was a very challenging task. On the Tian Yuan continent, many people weren\u2019t capable of forming a Saint Weapon since birth, because they lacked the aptitude, as well as the innate skill. According to the headmaster, Changyang Hu had already reached the peak of the 10th layer a year ago and had already tried to form a Saint Weapon 3 times, but only met with failure each time.However, seeing an 18 year old that could form a Saint Weapon by the age of 18 was rare to see on the Tian Yuan continent. The average age was around 20 years before a Saint Weapon could be formed, but most of them were geniuses. Of course, the average person could make a Saint Weapon at that age as well, but most of them would not be able to walk down the path of martial arts for long.Because the spiritual Qi of the Tian Yuan continent was abundant, the average life span of a person was around 200 years. For a person to form a Saint Weapon at the age of 20, that could be considered decent.Chang Bai pointed at Changyang Hu and said to Jian Chen, \u201cFourth master, that person is your brother Changyang Hu.\u201d Looking over at him, he cried, \u201cEldest master, this is your younger brother Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201d\u201cBig brother!\u201d Jian Chen looked at Changyang Hu with a smile as he shouted out a greeting. In his eyes, he had felt that Changyang Hu looked to be a strong yet straightforward person, but his heart was not in complete agreement.Hearing Jian Chen\u2019s shout, Changyang Hu scratched at his cheek with a laugh, \u201cFourth brother, feel free to call on me anytime. If you are bullied in the future, then look for me straight away, and I\u2019ll smash them to pieces!\u201dLaughing at his brother\u2019s speech, Jian Chen responded, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be relying on, you big brother.\u201d With this first impression, Jian Chen had thought that Changyang Hu was pretty nice, and so all worries he had about his big brother began to disappear like smoke.Changyang Hu shook his head and laughed once more, \u201cIt\u2019ll be no problem, not a problem at all. No matter what you say, I am still your older brother, so protecting the fourth brother is an absolute must.\u201d After this, Changyang Hu suddenly froze before looking around, his eyes revealing some doubts. \u201cChang Bai, where are second sister and third brother?\u201d He asked.\u201cEldest master, the second lady and third master have not yet reached the requirements to enter the academy, so it is only the fourth master that was able to join.\u201d Chang Bai answered serenely.\u201cOh!\u201d Hearing that, Changyang Hu let loose a disappointed look and began to mutter, \u201cHow did they not reach the requirement of reaching the 8th layer. This is silly. Fourth brother is more formidable, since he reached the 8th layer so quickly. He\u2019s even more amazing than me, his older brother.\u201cEldest master, please escort the fourth master down. From today on, you need to properly look after your younger brother. I still have some business to settle with the headmaster.\u201d Chang Bai said.Changyang Hu nodded his head firmly and pounded his chest with his fist, \u201cChang Bai, don\u2019t worry! I definitely won\u2019t allow anyone in the school to bully fourth brother!\u201dAfterwards, Jian Chen received the school medal and left with his older brother.After exiting the tower, Jian Chen looked at the school medal in his hands. Aside from it being proof of him being a student, it also contained his dorm address.Although Jian Chen was not familiar with the layout of the academy, but because Changyang Hu was there to lead the way, they both ended up at their destination sooner than he had expected.The dormitories of the academy were built using a very durable type of stone and were split into 2 different areas. One area was for the commoners to live in, and the other side was for people like Jian Chen, who had a prestigious clan backing them up. The differences between the two were like comparing the heavens to the earth.Kargath Academy was Gesun Kingdom\u2019s most prestigious academy, so it naturally had to have a unique characteristic. Kargath Academy had a very strict rule; one must reach the 8th layer of Saint Force before they reach the age of 18 in order to fulfill the requirement. If a student does not reach this level, then even if they are from an extremely prestigious and rich family, they will not be able to enroll in the academy.Because the tuition costs were very low, even the commoners were able enroll with ease. Some of the students that successfully enrolled came from impoverished families, but Kargath Academy had even waived the fee for many. For that reason, many students were of a commoner\u2019s background, and had a poor innate skill for cultivation.At Kargath Academy, there was also another iron-set rule that an aristocrat\u2019s follower could not casually bully commoner students. Otherwise, no matter how powerful your family background was, you would still suffer from a serious punishment. If the situation was serious enough, then you might even be expelled. Although this would offend some major families, Kargath Academy\u2019s had the backing of the Gesun Kingdom. Moreover, the headmaster was one of the six major elites in Gesun Empire, so no major family dared to speak up against this iron-set rule.Jian Chen\u2019s dorm room was around 10 square meters, and the room\u2019s decor was extremely simple. Aside from a bed and a chair, there wasn\u2019t anything else present. However, the entire room had been tidied so that it was extremely clean and organized, and it was completely spotless\u201cFourth brother, this is your room; remember the location well, and be careful to not go the wrong way.\u201d Changyang Hu laughed.Jian Chen nodded, and after throwing down some of the clothes he had brought with him, he was pulled away by his older brother to wander around the school grounds. Changyang Hu claimed that it was so that Jian Chen could familiarize himself with his new surroundings.For the entire afternoon, Jian Chen was dragged around by Changyang Hu to wander aimlessly around the school.Suddenly, Changyang Hu opened his mouth to say, \u201cFourth brother, tomorrow is the annual new student competition. There are plenty of rewards, and the first newcomer king can even win a rank 3 Magic Stone. The person in second place can win a rank 2 Magic Stone, and the person in third place can win a rank 1 Magic Stone. You have to try your best and earn first place.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13: Competition of the New StudentsJian Chen\u2019s heart pounded after hearing that, \u201cEldest brother, aren\u2019t Class 3 Monster Cores precious?\u201d Even though Jian Chen knew about monster cores, he was still ignorant in regards to their prices.\u201cOf course. Class 3 Monster Cores can be sold for more than 100 Amethyst coins. I joined this academy 4 years ago, but I have never been able to use a Class 3 Monster Core; the highest I\u2019ve used was a Class 2 core that cost me 50 Amethyst coins.\u201d Changyang Hu\u2019s face started to show signs of heartache after saying that.Jian Chen began to plan it all out in his head. He quickly decided that he would try his best to win that Class 3 Monster Core from the martial arts competition. Despite never using a Class 3 Monster core before, he knew that absorbing the energy contained inside would allow him to increase his rate of cultivation. He didn\u2019t know how fast he would be able to absorb World Essence after taking the Class 3 Core, but he knew that by using it, the peak of the 10th Saint Force Layer was within reach.As the sky gradually grew darker, Changyang Hu led Jian Chen down to the student dining hall. After the dinner they split off and went their own ways, returning to their dormitories.After returning to his room, Jian Chen closed the door and sat on his bed and to begin cultivating once more. However, he suddenly heard a knock on the door. Jian Chen looked at the door in confusion, before walking to the door and opening it.Standing outside the door was a 30 year old woman wearing a light green dress. Although her beauty was not so much as to cause entire cities to war for her favor, she could still be considered beautiful. Her long, dark green hair went down to her shoulders, and gave off an impression as if it was floating.\u201cIs there something you needed?\u201d Jian Chen asked with some confusion.\u201cYou are one of the new students of Kargath Academy. Tomorrow will be the Kargath Academy\u2019s annual Freshmen Competition.It is mandatory for all new students to participate. Do not forget to come.\u201d She spoke with a tone that was as equally apathetic as her stare.\u201cYes, I know. Is there anything else?\u201d Jian Chen asked.\u201cNo.\u201d After dropping this word, the woman turned around to leave and walk to the next room. It seemed as if she had to notify every students one by one.Closing the door, Jian Chen returned to his bed and sat down on it. Quickly, he returned to a silent state of cultivation.The next morning, Jian Chen finished his night of cultivation, left his room and headed towards the dining hall alone. Since he left so early, there weren\u2019t many people up yet so he was able to find himself an empty table to sit at due to the entire hall being almost empty.After eating his breakfast, Jian Chen headed towards the center of the academy grounds where the sports field were. The martial arts competition would be taking place in the stadium here.Along the way, Jian Chen noticed that he was surrounded by freshmen just like him, and they were also heading towards the sports field. Because the elder students all wore a school uniform, Jian Chen could clearly recognize which ones were freshmen. Although, there weren\u2019t that many upperclassmen;perhaps they did not have much interest in the freshman competition.When Jian Chen arrived at the sports field, he could see 5 circles, each 30 feet in diameter, on top of the sports grounds. There were already many people already surrounding it.Jian Chen arrived at a tree a few meters away from the grounds. Quickly running towards the tree, he pushed off against the tree trunk to jump upwards towards the tree top. Settling down on the tree branch, Jian Chen started to rest in the shade, since it was still too early for the competition to start. He was in no rush to get there so early, and pointlessly suffer under the blazing sun.Time quickly passed. Soon, it was the time for the competition to start. At this time, the competition arena was already packed with thousands of students. Only a few of them wore student uniforms, everyone else was a new student.However, Jian Chen noticed that most of the freshmen students \u2013students who had achieved the ninth layer or better\u2013 were most definitely from commoner families. He made this judgement based on the new student uniforms they all had to wear; these people were wearing crude and coarse versions. This made sense given that the Gesun Kingdom was predominantly comprised of commoners, and children from impoverished families were used to working hard. Thus, these kids worked hard to improve when cultivating Saint Force, and so were capable of reaching the 8th layer and joining Kargath Academy.Aside from those students, the rest of the freshmen seemed to be around 16 to 17 years old. There were even some ** year olds. Jian Chen himself was 15 when he had reached the 8th layer, an achievement that could not be so easily replicated, and so it made Jian Chen the youngest student there. Despite that, Jian Chen\u2019s physical growth far surpassed anyone else. Although he was really 15 years old, he was built as if he were a few years older.After resting for a while, Jian Chen hopped to the ground nimbly and walked towards the competition area. Although a crowd was already forming, Jian Chen didn\u2019t try to force his way through. Instead, he calmly stood on the outside. Regarding the freshman martial arts competition, Jian Chen had no interest in it at all; even watching it didn\u2019t seem appealing to him. The only reason he would be participating today was because of the Class 3 Monster Core.\u201cEveryone, quiet down!\u201dSuddenly, a loud piercing sound rang out. The cry was so loud, it was heard by everyone in the sports field and everybody immediately became quiet. In an instant, the whole field became absolutely silent..A white-robed, middle-aged man came walking up to the podium. The man looked like any other man his age, with no remarkable features. However, the light in his eyes was so bright, it looked as if he had a Saint Weapon hidden inside, making people afraid to stare straight into his eyes.Looking at everyone, the man smiled kindly. Speaking loudly in a friendly voice, he said, \u201cDear students, I am the vice-principal of Kargath Academy Bai En. I will be the one in charge of today\u2019s martial arts competition today as well as being the one who makes up the rules. I am going to presume everyone has already seen the rules on the post board at the school gates, so I won\u2019t repeat it. The prize for this year is the same as always, the first place winner will win a Class 3 Monster Core, the runner up will win the Class 2 Monster Core, and the third place winner will get the Class 1 Monster Core. Other than that, the top 50 participants in this competition will receive a single Amethyst coin as a prize.Hearing this, every single student wearing the uniform of the commoners began to cheer in excitement. They did not spend much from day to day and only had simple food as their meal every day. A single Gold Coin was enough to feed a family of three for a month, and an Amethyst Coin was worth 100 Gold coins. Although a Monster Core was a precious item, but none of them had any high hopes to win one since there were only 3 chances to earn one. But getting a single Amethyst coin had 50 chances to be earned.At this moment, pretty much all the students from less privileged families could not help but become more excited. They all inwardly swore to themselves that for the sake of this Amethyst Coin, they would have to work hard to enter the top 50 spots.Looking at the jubilant expressions on the faces of the commoners, some of the nobles looked on with disdain. A single Amethyst coin may not be such a small amount of money to a commoner, but to a noble, it was worth very little. Even Jian Chen had 50 Amethyst coins on himself to use as he wished.The freshmen martial arts competition began not long after. The students personally drew individual lots to draw tags from within a large container. However, the tags were covered by a piece of paper, making it impossible to see the numbers on them.The two pots had different labels. One of the pots were for students who had reached the 8th layer while the other pot was for those who had reached the 9th layer. This method made sure that no student would fight another student from a different layer and make the outcome of the battle completely predictable from the start.Although Kargath Academy\u2019s lowest entry requirement was having reached the eighth Saint Force level, there were always some new people amongst the freshmen every year that were geniuses who were not at all lacking in terms of cultivation. It could also be said that there were a few treasured geniuses that had been given up by the aristocratic families, so there were always freshmen that had already achieved the ninth Saint Force layer admitted to the school every year.Drawing lots did not take long to accomplish, and soon enough it was Jian Chen\u2019s turn. Looking at the pot, Jian Chen casually grabbed a single tag from within. Unsealing the tag, he read the words with a relieved look, \u201cThird stage, number 64.\u201dSeeing the number on the tag, he inwardly understood clearly that his opponent would be number 136 on the third stage, because this time\u2019s competition matched opponents based on finding the two numbers that would give a sum of 200.After getting their tags, every student slowly walked towards their respective platforms while Jian Chen walked over to the third platform.The competitions were progressing at a fast rate, as the first round of the competition only took half a day. Because Jian Chen\u2019s own opponent was not at all knowledgeable about how to fight with martial arts, Jian Chen had easily won and made his way into round 2.After eating lunch, the freshmen martial arts competition continued. However, the number of competitors had decreased by half. It seemed like there were only 500 people present by the end of that first round.The second round was decided in the same way as the first round, with drawing lots. Because the amount of people that remained was far less than that of the first round, it had only took 4 hours to finish. By the end of the 2nd round, 256 students were left standing, Coincidentally, since it was an even number, then there would not be an awkward situation where there would be a student that was left out of the drawings.Immediately heading into the third round, people began to draw lots to find their opponents. By night time, there were only 128 people that advanced onwards, with Jian Chen standing amongst them with a lazy expression.Leaving the competition grounds, Jian Chen noticed that the sky had long since darkened. He rubbed at his protesting stomach and shook his head with slight disappointment. In his previous world, he could have gone several days and nights without eating and still not feel hungry. Now that he was used to three meals a day, he now felt hungry after skipping a single meal, leaving Jian Chen to feel slightly disappointed with himself.Soon, Jian Chen arrived at the dining hall. After receiving his food, he found an empty seat and began to eat. Although the food was simple, completely incomparable to what he had in the Changyang household, Jian Chen still ate it with relish.Since the current freshmen martial arts competition had just ended, the current number of people present in the dining hall was not any less than usual. In fact, there were so many people that not long after Jian Chen sat down, all of the seats in the dining hall had been filled. There were still many people who couldn\u2019t find available spaces. Although Jian Chen was sitting alone at a table, not a single person dared to sit together with him, since all the other students there were peasants. How could they possibly dare to sit with Jian Chen, who was wearing luxurious clothing? It was obvious at first glance that he was from an aristocratic family.\u201cPeng!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was a monster of a student; a 200 kilogram rock was impossible to lift for the average adult. But for a young boy like Tie Ta to be able to lift such a titanic rock, Jian Chen could only feel awe from this fact.\u201cTie Ta, how old are you?\u201d Jian Chen had started to look at Tie Ta in a different light now.\u201c16 years old.\u201d Tie Ta said as he munched on his food, his chewing caused his words to be almost inaudible.Jian Chen\u2019s impression of him grew even more as he said, \u201cTie Ta, did you have this strength since you were a kid?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, my strength was always stronger than most but then so was my appetite. Because I couldn\u2019t always eat until I was full in my home, I usually went up to the mountains and hunted for my own food.\u201d Tie Ta said flatly.Taking in a deep breath, Jian Chen mentally confirmed that Tie Ta\u2019s strength was definitely a god given power. Otherwise, a young boy like him would never have been able to lift such a heavy rock. But what surprised Jian Chen even more was that Tie Ta would frequently hunt by himself in the mountains. For someone who was barely 16 to be able to hunt with ease in the mountains, this made Jian Chen\u2019s respect for him grow by an extreme amount. After all, not only did wild beasts appear in the mountains, magical beasts would occasionally appear as well and the latter\u2019s strengths were incomparable to those of regular wild beasts.Tie Ta rubbed at his stomach and stood up from his stool with a laugh, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I\u2019ve eaten my fill so I\u2019ll be returning to my dorm to sleep. Tomorrow is another day of the competition after all.\u201dJian Chen nodded his head, \u201cI hope that you will make it into the top 3 in tomorrow\u2019s contest.\u201dTie Ta fiercely nodded and a resolute look could be seen in his eyes, \u201cI will definitely work hard and strive for the top 3. A single Class 1 Monster Core can be sold for at least 10 Amethyst coins!\u201dNot long after Tie Ta had left, Jian Chen quickly ate his own food and returned to his room. Right as he closed the door behind him, a knock could be heard on it.\u201cFourth brother, are you here?\u201d Asked Changyang Hu in a strong voice.Hearing the voice, Jian Chen was surprised. It had been two full days since he had last seen any trace of his brother. Quickly opening the door, he invited Changyang Hu inside his room.\u201cFourth brother, I\u2019m sorry but I haven\u2019t been keeping track with your progress in the competition.\u201d He hurriedly said before Jian Chen could open his mouth to ask a question.Jian Chen nodded his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already advanced onto the top 8; tomorrow will be the final day of the matches.\u201dAs he listened to Jian Chen, Changyang Hu suddenly grew happy for his younger brother\u2019s success. Excitedly, he said, \u201cFourth brother, you are truly amazing! It\u2019s no wonder you came here before second sister and third brother.\u201d Fishing a thumb sized crystal out of his pockets, Changyang Hu placed it within Jian Chen\u2019s hands, \u201cFourth brother, this is a Class 1 Monster Core. Two days ago, a few friends and I went to the forest behind the academy and killed a Class 1 Magical Beast together. This is the monster core I fought to get for you, so take it. It\u2019s already getting late, so your big brother won\u2019t disturb your rest anymore. Tomorrow is the final day of the competition, so you must work hard and earn the number one title!\u201d Changyang Hu then exited from the room, after slowly closing the door shut.The moment before Changyang Hu could close the door, Jian Chen caught a glimpse of a 3 inch long claw mark that ran down Changyang Hu\u2019s arm.Silently looking at the Class 1 Monster Core in his hands, Jian Chen felt a wave of warmth that lingered. For a while, Jian Chen\u2019s heart was actually unable to calm down.Although it was only a Class 1 Monster Core, Jian Chen could feel Changyang Hu\u2019s concern radiating from it. Thinking back to the wound on Changyang Hu\u2019s arm, Jian Chen knew that the wound came from hunting a magical beast. Whenever Jian Chen thought about the gift, he couldn\u2019t help but feel warm inside, another emotion that he had never experienced in his previous life.After standing in the center of his room with a stunned expression for a while, Jian Chen finally took a deep breath, gradually forcing himself into a state of calm. Then, he got onto his bed to start cultivating once more. Although he had the monster core now, he did not want to use it just yet, so he stored it away in his Space Belt. With the competition in mind, Jian Chen fully believed that he could take the number one spot. After all, in his previous world, he was a unique expert that stood at the peak of the world. And although he had lost a great amount of his power after reincarnating, he still had the knowledge of every type of swordplay, as well as understanding the deep profound sword laws, so much that they were ingrained into his soul. He had not lost his understanding of the ways of the sword, and so this is how Jian Chen would advance through the continent in the future.The next morning, Jian Chen finished his breakfast quickly before arriving at the competition. Perhaps it was because today was the final day of the competition, but a lot more people came today than the two previous days combined. Many of these newcomers were older students.The fighting grounds had been fully fixed last night, and the original five arenas had been changed to four. However, the four arenas were now larger than before; the arenas from yesterday were on a completely different level that couldn\u2019t be compared with the new sizes.At this moment, Jian Chen felt something behind him. Turning around, he saw his older brother Changyang Hu forging his way forward of the crowd, trying to reach him.Taking note of Jian Chen\u2019s stare, Changyang Hu smiled widely. Quickly detaching himself from the crowd, he ran up to Jian Chen\u2019s side and slapped him on the shoulder. \u201cFourth Brother, today is the day you must work hard. Your big brother won\u2019t demand of you to get the number one spot; getting into the top 3 is good enough!\u201d To Changyang Hu, getting a monster core was only a minor reward, the most important thing was getting a good rank. Although the price of a monster core was not easily ignored, it was not something that the eldest son of the Changyang Clan deeply desired.Jian Chen laughed and said, \u201cBig brother, you don\u2019t have to worry. I definitely will not let you down.\u201dThe time of the competition came quickly. This time, the top 8 would fight it out in the semi finals. After drawing lots to decide their opponents, Jian Chen immediately walked onto the arena. Not long after, Jian Chen\u2019s opponent slowly came up into the arena, but to Jian Chen\u2019s surprise, his opponent was a girl. More precisely, his opponent was the girl from last time\u2013 Ka Di Qiuli.Ka Di Qiuli was wearing a dark red style of clothing, and although she was only 16 or 17 years old, her body was developing nicely. What should be sticking out was sticking out, and what should be thin was thin. Her skin tight uniform sketched her out to be a true example of a beautiful woman with delicate white skin, along with her naturally beautiful face with tender white skin. At this point, she had already enraptured the attention of all the boys in the crowd and, without a doubt, Ka Di Qiuli was definitely beautiful enough to cause cities to fight over her. However, as true as it was for most people born into a prestigious clan, she carried around with her an arrogant air.Jian Chen stood empty handed on top of the arena. The reason why he was empty handed was because of the academy rules. They believed that the best way to judge a person\u2019s strength was by empty handed combat, and so bladed weapons were not allowed. And since it was not possible to form a Saint Weapon without being a Saint, all of the freshmen were forced to fight without weapons.Ka Di Qiuli looked at Jian Chen with a haughty look, \u201cYou really didn\u2019t let us down. For your arrogance in the dining hall the other day, I\u2019ll be sure to teach you a lesson today.\u201d Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s voice carried a sharp but clear sounding tone.Hearing this Jian Chen\u2019s face revealed a grin of disdain. Within the people who were born within prestigious clans, many of them truly did not know how vast the heavens and earth were.\u201cBoom!\u201dA loud sound rung throughout the arena, signalling the start of the match.Because all four of the arenas were in the same place, the moment the gong was heard, all 8 participants simultaneously started to move and began to fight.Ka Di Qiuli quickly strode towards Jian Chen, but when she was within 3 meters from him, she suddenly jumped up into the air to deliver a flying jump kick towards his face. Although Ka Di Qiuli was young, she was fairly strong since she was already at the 9th Saint Force layer.Jian Chen stood in place without moving a single step. As Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s foot got closer to his face, he tilted his neck sideways, allowing the kick to merely graze past the side of his head.Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s reaction speed was fairly fast, the moment she realized her kick didn\u2019t connect, she swung out at his nose with a Saint Force enhanced fist. Not only was her fist coming in at rapid speeds, but with a huge amount of energy stored within her fist, any normal person would come out with serious injuries after being hit by that. As far as Jian Chen was concerned, she would not hold back. No matter if she ended up defeating Jian Chen and moving on into the top 4, or if she was just teaching Jian Chen a lesson, she would definitely not allow herself to hold back.Jian Chen dealt with Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s attack with ease, and although his opponent was one layer higher than him, Jian Chen was not like an average child. His battle experiences from his past world were abundant, so if he wanted to continue this match without fighting back, then Ka Di Qiuli wouldn\u2019t even be able to touch his clothes, much less beat him within five rounds.After Ka Di Qiuli had tried to attack him a few dozen times without even being able to even touch Jian Chen\u2019s clothes, she grew extremely annoyed and stopped her barrage of blows. Panting slightly, she stuck both her hands by her waists and glared at Jian Chen, \u201cHey, are you going to actually fight or not? If you\u2019re not going to fight, then get off the arena instead of jumping around all over the place.\u201dJian Chen laughed as he looked at the fuming Ka Di Qiuli and said, \u201cThe person that\u2019ll be leaving the arena will be you, not me. How do you plan to beat me if you can\u2019t even touch my clothes?\u201d\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s naturally beautiful face grew red with anger as she pointed at him with her finger, and she was momentarily unable to speak. But then she grew calm and she rolled her eyes, sneering, \u201cSo what if I can\u2019t touch you? You can\u2019t even stand to fight me head on, and can only dodge my blows like a little coward.\u201d\u201cEh, is that right?\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face revealed a hint of a smile as he looked at her with a strange expression.Ka Di Qiuli looked on haughtily, speaking with complete conviction, \u201cOf course. If you aren\u2019t a coward, then you\u2019d better try actually fighting me.\u201dJian Chen glanced over at the other 3 rings and saw that the other matches were beginning to wrap up. Turning his head back to look at Ka Di Qiuli again, he laughed, \u201cIf you really want to fight me head on, then fine, I\u2019ll grant you your wish.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Advancing into the FinalsHearing Jian Chen words, Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s eyes brightened, \u201cYou said so yourself, so don\u2019t you dare try to say otherwise later!\u201d Ka Di Qiuli clearly had no desire to let Jian Chen prepare himself, so before she could even finish her sentence, she had already started to dash towards him. Just like the first blow, she leapt up into the air and lashed her leg out to kick him in the face, but this time the speed of her kick was much faster than her original one.Jian Chen gave an odd smile as the kick came closer. Just like he said earlier, Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to dodge, but instead, as the kick was right in front of his face, both of his hands lashed out and grabbed onto Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s calf. Exerting a decent amount of strength while twisting around, he whirled her around in one smooth motion. As he threw her, Ka Di Qiuli cried out in panic as she was spun around by Jian Chen.Many of the surrounding students watching the event became dumbstruck. Not only did it seem like Jian Chen did not care for the fairer s*x and threw such a beautiful lady into the air in such a crude way, he had also defeated the last 6 opponents in the same manner.Under the arena, Ka Di Yun felt the veins in his forehead throb as he watched his younger sister get mistreated in such a way. A murderous intent was focused on Jian Chen as he watched him; if it weren\u2019t for the vice headmaster Bai En presiding over the match nearby, then Ka Di Yun would have charged onto the arena long ago to teach Jian Chen a lesson.Jian Chen\u2019s two arms were almost like strong pincers, clamping down onto her legs, as he spun her around twice before finally letting go. At that moment, one could only see Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s beautiful body streak across the sky in an arc, before finally flying out of the arena, and crashing into a group of people in the audience.He had learned this trick from Tie Ta. After watching Tie Ta in some of his matches, he saw that he had done a similar method to easily toss his opponents out of the arena. However, Jian Chen had to admit, this method was a very easy trick to pull off for a quick but easy victory, and could be done to certain people with ease.With only a tiny bit of disdain for the people in the audience who helped Ka Di Qiuli back to her feet, Jian Chen smirked as the referee proclaimed him the winner, before walking off the stage slowly.Blankly looking at Jian Chen walk off the arena, Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s face fell. Since she was born, she had been pampered by thousands of people as she grew. For her to suffer humiliation from being tossed into the air after being spun around like a top, she had felt that she lost face as well as being wronged, despite not getting injured. As she thought about this, Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s eyes started to tear up, and she eventually began to leak out streams of tears as she cried silently to herself.As Jian Chen walked down from the arena, Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s brother, Ka Di Yun, blocked his path. Glaring at him icily, he growled, \u201cKid, you really have some fucking courage to treat my sister like that.\u201dJian Chen lazily glanced over at the furious Ka Di Yun and snorted. Without saying anything, Jian Chen walked away from him. Words were not worth wasting on him, because Jian Chen couldn\u2019t stand to hear Ka Di Yun try to use his clan\u2019s influence to bully others.Watching Jian Chen walk farther and farther away from him, Ka Di Yun\u2019s own face grew even more somber.With the end of Jian Chen\u2019s match, the final 4 names were called out. In the end, it was Changyang Xiang Tian, Tie Ta, Ka Di Liang, and Tian Mu Xiong that remained.As far as Tie Ta was concerned, Jian Chen was not at all surprised that he had made it. However, Jian Chen did not think that Ka Di Liang would unexpectedly make it into the top 4.There was also the fourth participant, Tian Mu Xiong. His age wasn\u2019t all that different from Ka Di Qiuli. He had a medium-sized body, and a pale complexion. Although he was young, there was no doubt that he was handsome, with a perfect balance of his facial structures.Sitting on top of the platform was the vice headmaster, Bai En, who slowly looked over the four remaining students. With a small nod and a laugh, he announced, \u201cIt would appear that this year\u2019s freshmen are much stronger than the freshmen before them. I can only hope that our Kargath Academy will be able to boast of someone just as strong after.\u201dAfter announcing the four remaining students, they were given an hour of rest before continuing on with the competition. However, by some miraculous chance, Jian Chen\u2019s drawn opponent was Ka Di Liang, while Tie Ta\u2019s opponent was Tian Mu Xiong.Under the arena, Ka Di Yun and his siblings gathered at the bottom and watched; Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s eyes were starting to become red and inflamed by this point.\u201cSecond brother, you have to teach him a lesson later.\u201d Ka Di Qiuli said with unrestrained fury to Ka Di Liang before the match started.Noticing his sister\u2019s red eyes and her tear stained face, Ka Di Liang couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely furious as he spoke, \u201cSister Qiu Li, don\u2019t worry. Even if I get penalized by the academy, your second brother will definitely teach him a lesson.\u201d\u201cHmph, what a savage kid. To think that he would dare treat our sister like this, he really does have a death wish. Sister, please don\u2019t worry, I guarantee you, that kid will definitely only feel suffering for as long as he lives in this academy. Although the headmaster sides with the poor people, he is by no means a commoner. Even if I beat him until he\u2019s a cripple, the headmaster won\u2019t say a thing; at the very most, he\u2019ll just scold us.\u201d Ka Di Yun\u2019s face looked as if he swallowed poison. When it came to their sister, both Ka Di Yun and Ka Di Liang cared greatly for her. When Jian Chen had treated their sister in such a way, he had already earned extreme hatred from both of them.Soon, Jian Chen and Ka Di Liang both walked onto the arena, and waited for the start of the match. Right as the gong sounded, Ka Di Liang dashed towards Jian Chen and tried to slam his fist into Jian Chen\u2019s stomach.Jian Chen nimbly dodged Ka Di Liang\u2019s attack, while returning the blow with his own fist that was even faster than his opponent\u2019s.\u201cPeng!\u201dBefore Ka Di Liang could even respond, Jian Chen\u2019s fist had already made contact with his back. The force of his punch was so strong, it forced Ka Di Liang to stagger backwards, before falling to his knees.After one blow, Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to hold back. Both of his legs went into motion as he quickly ran towards where Ka Di Liang was kneeling. All of a sudden, the originally staggering Ka Di Liang suddenly lost his footing once more and was sent flying again. After being hit, he flew two meters towards the edge of the ring, almost knocking him out of it, though half of his body was already hanging out of it.Watching this display of might, every student watching Jian Chen all cried out in surprise. They had never imagined that in a single engagement, the victor would be so readily decided. This was something that every student thought was amazing; the 9th layer Saint Force student Ka Di Liang was being beaten so easily by the 8th Saint Force layer Jian Chen.Seeing half of Ka Di Liang\u2019s body sticking out from the ring, both Ka Di Qiuli\u2019s and Ka Di Yun\u2019s hearts leapt out from their chests and into their throats.\u201cAi, how can second brother be this careless, how-how annoying. He\u2019d better not lose to a brat like him.\u201d Ka Di Qiuli cried as she stamped her foot in anger. Though the longer she looked at Ka Di Liang, the more easily one could tell her face was full of concern for her older brother.Ka Di Yun let out a breath in exasperation, \u201cWhat is second brother doing for him to be this careless and lose to a brat who\u2019s only at the 8th Saint Force?\u201dOn top of the platform, the vice headmaster Bai En smiled excitedly as he said, \u201cThe freshmen we picked up this year are definitely jewels. One has been blessed by the heavens, while the other I can polish and shine in the future. While his attacks are simple, there is a strange sort of mystery to him. Every single time there is a crucial point in the match, he unleashes highly accurate moves with almost instantaneous reactions. These two students truly do require closer nurturing. I believe that in the future, these two will be great experts within the Tian Yuan continent. I\u2019d better discuss this with the headmaster later.\u201dOn the arena, Ka Di Liang scrambled to pick himself back up, his forehead already dripping with cold sweat. If his body had slipped just a few more inches, then there would be no doubt that his body would\u2019ve fallen down from the arena. And then if he truly did lose to an 8th Saint Force layer student in such a disgraceful manner, he would definitely have been labeled as a great disgrace.When Ka Di Liang crawled back up and turned himself around, his surroundings suddenly blurred, and he was suddenly aware of an acute sense of pain in his stomach before he could fully comprehend what was happening. But then, his body felt as light as a feather, before he realized the stage was growing smaller and smaller. The next thing he knew, his body impacted the ground below, and his previously spotless white robes now sported a single dusty footprint.Blankly standing up from the ground, Ka Di Liang looked all around himself, before he fully comprehended what had just happened. Indignation burst forth from his eyes, as he shot Jian Chen a malicious glare. Although he had reached the 9th layer, he had ultimately been beaten by a student who had only reached the 8th layer, and felt his defeat was an extreme waste. Every time he thought of this, Ka Di Liang\u2019s heart filled with endless anger. To him, this was definitely a huge disgrace.Ka Di Yun walked up to Ka Di Liang and said, \u201cSecond brother, you\u2019ve disappointed me. You have really lost face for our Ka Di clan.\u201d After dropping these words, Ka Di Yun didn\u2019t spare a second glance at Ka Di Liang, and immediately left the area.Hearing Ka Di Yun\u2019s words, Ka Di Liang\u2019s face immediately turned beyond ugly.\u201cSecond brother, you were too careless. Although you said that you would help me teach him a lesson, it ultimately became you being the one that was taught.\u201d Ka Di Qiuli said resentfully in a disappointed voice, her tone quite indignant.Hearing this, Ka Di Liang\u2019s face changed as well, before growling, \u201cThis was the extent of his luck. It was because of this arena that he won; if we were to change places, then there would be no way he would be an opponent for me. Third sister, don\u2019t worry, I will definitely teach him a lesson in the future.\u201dKa Di Qiuli began to think; she felt that his reasoning had some truth to it. Slowly nodding her head, she said, \u201cSecond brother, you\u2019ll have to teach him a lesson for sure next time.\u201dKa Di Liang patted his chest, and solemnly vowed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, third sister. Leave this to me.\u201dNot too long after Jian Chen had won his match, the match between Tie Ta and Tian Mu Xiong also started to wrap up. Although Tie Ta\u2019s Saint Force was lower than his opponent by a single layer, his heavenly blessed strength helped make up for this deficiency. In the end, he relied on the experience he had learned from hunting beasts and was finally able to beat Tian Mu Xiong by a narrow victory. Along with Jian Chen, he became one of the two finalists. By the end of the next match, one of the two will emerge victorious and be crowned the Freshman Ruler.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17: Freshmen RulerAfter resting for two hours, the competition finals finally started. Jian Chen and Tie Ta walked into the arena together,before walking to opposite ends 10 meters apart.There were over 1000 students watching the arena already, while even more people were trying to find seats.Jian Chen looked at Tie Ta with a smile as he spoke he praised Tie Ta, \u201cTie Ta, I didn\u2019t think you were this amazing to be able to end up in the finals.\u201dHearing Jian Chen\u2019s compliment, Tie Ta\u2019s face reddened from embarrassment, though it was obvious that he was very happy to hear the praise. With an honest laugh, Tie Ta spoke in a low voice, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re just as amazing.\u201dStretching his arms and legs, Jian Chen laughed, \u201cTie Ta, this is the final round. Only one of us will be crowned the Freshmen Ruler, so you need to fight your hardest. If you beat me, then you\u2019ll be the champion; by winning, you\u2019ll earn a Class 3 Monster Core that is worth a few hundred purple coins. It\u2019ll be worth enough to feed your family for a lifetime.\u201dTie Ta grew pumped up after hearing Jian Chen talk, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I\u2019ll definitely use all of my strength, so you\u2019d better prepare yourself!\u201dJian Chen could only laugh and nod, \u201cI won\u2019t be that easy to defeat.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dAs the gong sounded to indicate the beginning of the match, Tie Ta immediately rushed forward after the sound. Tie Ta rushed at Jian Chen, and immediately reached out to grab him with both hands, he planned to use his heavenly blessed strength to lift and throw Jian Chen out of the arena.Realizing his plan, Jian Chen laughed; he was already extremely familiar with Tie Ta\u2019s style of fighting. For every single match so far, Tie Ta had used the same strategy, but it had worked nicely. If Jian Chen was caught by him, then it would be extremely difficult to escape from Tie Ta\u2019s grasp.Jian Chen retreated a few steps to escape from Tie Ta\u2019s reach. Clenching his left hand into a fist, he used around 80% of his strength to strike at his chest.Jian Chen\u2019s fist was well timed and fast, not allowing Tie Ta any time to react at all.\u201cPeng!\u201dJian Chen\u2019s fist let out a muffled sound on impact against Tie Ta\u2019s chest. However, Jian Chen\u2019s look of satisfaction slowly changed, while Tie Ta had a look of amazement. What he had punched did not feel like a human at all, instead, his fist had felt like it had smashed against a wall. Not only was Tie Ta strong, but his physical body was extremely robust, so robust that it was actually beyond belief.Jian Chen\u2019s punch, however, had forced Tie Ta to stagger backwards, but only for a moment. Roaring out loud, he charged at Jian Chen once more with both of his hands outstretched. With a punch using only 80% of his strength, Jian Chen didn\u2019t even leave a mark on Tie Ta\u2019s skin.Jian Chen began to feel excitement as he watched Tie Ta come closer with his fists. He didn\u2019t bother to dodge or flee; instead, he prepared to use 100% of his power to strike back with his own hands.The two fists struck against each other in midair, and the impact created a loud sound. It was so loud, that everyone in the crowd below the arena could hear it as clear as day.As the two fists made contact, Jian Chen\u2019s feet couldn\u2019t help but slide backwards at least 10 meters before finally stopping. His right hand had already started to tremble, so it was clear to see that Jian Chen had taken more damage than given. Even though he had surpassed the average cultivation level for Saint Force, he was still far from the level where he could easily ignore damage from something like this.Tie Ta, on the other hand, only slid backwards two meters. His face showed no outward emotion, and he appeared to not have suffered even the smallest amount of damage.Jian Chen rubbed at his reddening hand. After two confrontations, he now fully understood how foolish it was to engage with Tie Ta straight on. Tie Ta\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t just used for intimidation, his body was actually inconceivably strong.. Even someone a level stronger than Tie Ta could not be his equal. The only thing that could lead to victory against Tie Ta was if one relied on speed.\u201cTie Ta, your strength has already far surpassed my expectations, but I\u2019ll be using my full strength now.\u201d Jian Chen said as he walked forward.Tie Ta laughed, \u201cCome then, Changyang Xiang Tian, you won\u2019t be able to hurt me.\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s tone was filled with a fierce conviction.Jian Chen stopped his idle chatter as well. When the distance between him and Tie Ta had been reduced to only 5-6 meters, his footsteps suddenly changed. His legs became a mysterious blur that suddenly re-appeared behind Tie Ta. Before Tie Ta could even react, two fierce fists landed consecutive blows on his back.\u201cDong!\u201d \u201cDong!\u201d \u201cDong!\u201dA constant series of muffled blows came ringing out from the arena, almost as if it was just a single continuous line of sounds. Under such heavy attacks, even Tie Ta\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but falter forwards so much that he was left with very little time to turn around.\u201cHa!\u201dTie Ta snarled in anger as he tried to steady himself. Suddenly, he turned around with his fists out and tried to smash them into Jian Chen.The moment when Tie Ta tried to attack Jian Chen, he lightly leapt 2 meters into the air. Narrowly dodging Tie Ta\u2019s fist, Jian Chen used both of his legs to kick at Tie Ta from midair. Both of his legs held formidable power, and they thrusted towards Tie Ta\u2019s back.\u201cDong!\u201d \u201cDong!\u201d \u201cDong!\u201d\u2026Jian Chen lashed out with his feet several times before landing back onto the ground. By this point, Tie Ta\u2019s face had been kicked by Jian Chen multiple times, causing his face to bruise all over.Immediately after landing on the ground, Jian Chen turned around on the floor and bent his legs down without pausing. His left leg revolved in a 180 degree arc, his right leg swept at Tie Ta\u2019s own legs.\u201cPeng!\u201dTie Ta\u2019s leg crumbled down below him, but he immediately bounced back up, and snarled as he rushed at Jian Chen.Jian Chen and Tie Ta began to engage in another close combat situation, but with Tie Ta\u2019s god given strength and his frighteningly robust body, Jian Chen had no chance of winning against him. Since Jian Chen had already experienced it twice, he had thought of a countermeasure for this situation. Although it wasn\u2019t the best idea, he had no other ways of fighting against him. Jian Chen had decided to rely on his nimbleness to fight against Tie Ta. Even though Tie Ta\u2019s body was extremely strong, Jian Chen had been attacking the same place on Tie Ta\u2019s body to make it so that Tie Ta would feel so much pain, he would eventually be forced to grimace.The following situation was now becoming one sided. With Jian Chen relying on the experience he had accumulated over the past world to constantly beat Tie Ta so much that he could only run around with his hands over his head. Although at times Tie Ta had found some opportunities to fight back, he was not able to hurt Jian Chen, his attacks could not even touch Jian Chen\u2019s clothes at all.At this display, every student in the audience could only watch the match in shock. No matter how fast Jian Chen was with his martial arts, his speed had far outstripped the average person, causing all of the students to look on with great interest, as it was something they had never witnessed before.On the top of the platform, Bai En gasped in admiration as he watched Jian Chen, \u201cThis kid is definitely a unique one, his battle experience is rich, and his speed isn\u2019t slow at all either. It seems this student is called Changyang Xiang Tian, so judging from his name, he is from Lore City\u2019s Changyang Clan. It seems that I really will have to make a report to the headmaster later.\u201dAs the battle continued to persist, Tie Ta finally reached his limit. He cried out loud, and exclaimed, \u201cStop, stop! I can\u2019t fight anymore, I give up!\u201dJian Chen immediately stopped his attack and smiled brightly at Tie Ta, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you fighting anymore?\u201dTie Ta rubbed at the reddening spots where Jian Chen had repeatedly hit with a miserable face and said sadly, \u201cYou move so fast that I can\u2019t even see you clearly. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to attack you, so the entire time was just you wailing on me.\u201dLaughing, Jian Chen asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to give up the number one spot then?\u201d Although Jian Chen hadn\u2019t held back as he fought against Tie Ta, his skin was so thick and his body was so strong, that there was barely any serious damage done to him at all.Tie Ta nodded his head and spoke in a muffled voice, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to beat you, so the number one spot isn\u2019t mine to have. Second place is already decent enough; a Class 2 Monster Core can be sold for a decent price to.\u201dAfterwards, the two students walked off the stage while the third place winner was announced; Ka Di Liang and Tian Mu Xiong who had fought it out against each other in a battle to determine the winner. In the end, it was Tian Mu Xiong who had won and claimed the title of third place.After the quota for the top three players was met, Jian Chen was called up onto the platform. As the vice headmaster Bai En walked towards him, he glanced at Jian Chen with no small amount of admiration. Immediately looking away, he turned his head to look at the thousand students in the audience and announced, \u201cDear students, this year\u2019s freshmen competition has finally come to a conclusion. I declare the Freshmen Ruler of this year to be the student Changyang Xiang Tian who is an 8th Saint Force layer practitioner!\u201dThe vice headmaster Bai En spoke in a firm voice, causing everyone to applaude and cheer. But as some of the 9th Saint Force layer students heard the new Freshmen Ruler was a student was at the 8th Saint Force layer, many of them couldn\u2019t accept that. However, they could only grumble out their displeasure. But Jian Chen\u2019s strength was something they could accept, some of them had even been dazzled by the way he fought, and his speed was something that not many people could dismiss.\u201cThis year\u2019s freshmen are really too useless. In front of so many people that had reached the 9th Saint Force level, the final Freshmen Ruler ended up being a youth at the 8th Saint Force layer. This is really too embarrassing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, today\u2019s freshmen were really too weak. Not only was the title of Freshmen Ruler taken by a person at the 8th Saint Force layer, I heard that the suntanned youth in second place was also someone who was only at the 8th Saint Force layer. I really don\u2019t know what these freshmen had practiced to the 9th Saint Force layer for.\u201dThe two people that spoke were seniors wearing the academy uniform, their tone were filled with a mocking voice towards those who had lost against the two.Hearing the two students complain, another one of the seniors replied to them, \u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t even say anything, it\u2019s not that those freshmen who reached the 9th Saint Force layer were weak, but it\u2019s because those 8th Saint Force layer students were stronger than them by a large margin. That suntanned kid had strength that could scare anyone. Don\u2019t tell me you guys didn\u2019t see how those 9th Saint Force layer students were easily thrown out of the arena. If it were us that were fighting instead, I\u2019m sure that we wouldn\u2019t had been better off than the freshmen. As for that first place freshman, his strength was even more terrifying. Did you guys also miss how fast he was moving around and attacking? Even if it were us in that same situation, we would have a hard time trying to dodge his attacks.\u201dOther than those two students, many other seniors of the academy were also discussing the matches amongst themselves. They had already been at the academy for so many years, but this years competition had left them speechless. This year\u2019s freshmen batch had many students who reached the 9th Saint Force layer, but no one had expected that the top two students would be 8th Saint Force layer students.Soon after, Jian Chen obtained the Class 3 Monster Core as a reward. It was a deep red in color, and was bigger than the monster core than the one his brother had given him earlier.Holding his hand up, Jian Chen could clearly feel the huge amount of power radiating from the core. The huge amount of energy in the core and the True Qi in his previous world had a very small difference, but as far as Jian Chen was concerned, the energy coming from the core was extremely huge.Aside from the monster core, Jian Chen had also received a medal that was cast in complete gold with a decorative design written on it.From what Jian Chen had heard, there was no information on the medal he had won, so he had no idea what use the medal was for. But as he was trying to figure it out, the vice headmaster Bai En explained to him, \u201cThis medal can only be rewarded to the first place winner of every freshman competition. As long as you have this, then you will be given a Class 1 Monster Core every month. Other than that, the medal allows the wearer to access the first 5 layers of the library.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18: The Monster Core\u2019s Cultivation Rate Support \u201cEvery month a Class 1 Monster Core will be given, as well as free access to the first five levels of the library?\u201d Hearing Bai En\u2019s explanation, Jian Chen\u2019s heart swelled up in marvel. Could it be that the students weren\u2019t able to even get a monster core every month? And who would have thought that the library would have a restriction imposed on it? Receiving the medal, Jian Chen had already planned to ask his brother Changyang Hu about this later. He had already been in this academy for three or four days, but three of the days had been completely occupied by the martial arts competition. Even for the first day, he had barely half the day to himself, so he had very little time to find out more about the academy. After Jian Chen exited from the arena, both Tie Ta and Tian Mu Xiong walked forward to accept their own prizes. After the ending ceremony, the crowd of students had already begun to disperse. \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re seriously amazing! You really did win first place in the competition; once father hears about this, he\u2019ll definitely be very happy about this.\u201d As the two walked towards his dorm, Changyang Hu kept chattering away happily with Jian Chen. As the two continued to talk, Jian Chen started to laugh, as he couldn\u2019t help but feel the warm feelings he had remembered from his mother. \u201cIf Mother found out about this, she would definitely be beyond happy.\u201d Jian Chen thought to himself. In a flash, Changyang Hu and Jian Chen arrived at the dorms and entered Jian Chen\u2019s room. Changyang Hu impatiently asked Jian Chen, \u201cFourth brother, hurry up and show me the Class 3 Monster Core.\u201d Looking at Changyang Hu\u2019s still excited expression, Jian Chen laughed and brought out the monster core from his space belt, handing it over to Changyang Hu. Changyang Hu took the core into his hand and turned it around endlessly almost as if it was a treasured object. He clicked his tongue in admiration, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re seriously amazing, to immediately get a Class 3 Monster Core straight after entering the academy. Your older brother has already been at this academy for over 2 years, and the most I ever got was a Class 2 Monster Core. Moreover, I had to pay money for it.\u201d Hearing this, Jian Chen could only chuckle, \u201cBig brother, I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve already reached the peak of the 10th layer and will soon break through to the Saint level. You should take this Class 3 Monster Core.\u201d Jian Chen didn\u2019t regard the monster core as an important item, and although the Class 3 Monster Core would increase the rate of cultivation, Jian Chen didn\u2019t need it at all. Changyang Hu was stunned at Jian Chen\u2019s words, but he quickly regained his wits and placed the Class 3 Monster Core back within Jian Chen\u2019s hands and said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. This Class 3 Monster Core was something that fourth brother got after going through a painstaking amount of trouble. How could your big brother take something like this?\u201d Looking at the newly returned Class 3 Monster Core, Jian Chen smiled; he truly admired his big brother\u2019s actions just then. At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry that Changyang Hu would be like third brother Changyang Ke, and become an obstacle towards him. Once again, Jian Chen placed the Class 3 Monster Core in Changyang Hu\u2019s hands, \u201cBig brother, this Class 3 Monster Core would be best with you.\u201d This time, Jian Chen really wanted Changyang Hu to accept the monster core. \u201cDefinitely not!\u201d Changyang Hu\u2019s refusal came out strong and clear, without any hesitation. He handed the monster core back to Jian Chen and said, \u201cFourth Brother, this monster core should be used by you. This is your reward for being the Freshmen Ruler. This item is definitely not something your big brother would want from you.\u201d Seeing how persistent his brother Changyang Hu was, Jian Chen could only helplessly take back the Class 3 Monster Core. After that, Jian Chen began to ask his older brother a few questions regarding the affairs of the academy. It had taken 3 hours for Changyang Hu to carefully explain every single rule that Jian Chen didn\u2019t understand about the academy, increasing Jian Chen\u2019s familiarity with the academy. First was Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster, who favored students that weren\u2019t from a noble background. If he found a noble bullying a commoner, the student would definitely not be able to escape from punishment. Regarding battles between nobles, he would turn a blind eye, as long as it didn\u2019t turn into a major deal. Other than that, he didn\u2019t care about them at all. Also, within the Kargath Academy, one would have to reach the Great Saint level in order to graduate. Those who graduate had the choice to remain in the academy, or with the Kargath Academy\u2019s recommendation, they could vow loyalty to a kingdom and join their army. Those with a great amount of potential would be able to earn a higher salary with the academy\u2019s recommendation. Within the academy, those under the level of a Saint would have the chance to receive a Class 1 Monster Core every month to use to help their cultivations. The students who were at the Saint Level and condensed a Saint Weapon would be able to earn a Class 2 Monster Core every month. Aside from this, these students would also be able to go to the forest 20 miles away from the Kargath Academy to hunt magical beasts for their cores. Although the forest wasn\u2019t big, it still took up around 10 kilometers of area. The magical beasts inside the forest were all set free by the academy, but most of them were generally low leveled magical beasts. Their attack strengths were amongst the lowest of the beasts, and receiving a serious injury was unlikely. Kargath Academy bred these low leveled magical beasts for the students to practice their martial arts in a real combat situation, as well as to allow the magical beasts to adapt to the wild. The strongest magical beast in the forest was no stronger than a Class 2 beast, while many of the animals were just regular wild beasts who couldn\u2019t even measure up to a Class 1 magical beast. However, if a Class 2 magical beast were to appear, then the academy would send out a few experts to take care of the monster in order to prevent the students from getting hurt. The forest was separated into three regions: the first region was full of wild beasts who didn\u2019t even reach the level of a Class 1 magical beast. The second region was a place where Class 1 magical beasts dwelled. The final region was full of Class 2 magical beasts. All three areas had been successfully sealed and blockaded against the other areas by the previous generations of the headmaster, so no one would have to worry about the monsters escaping from the forest. The academy also had a library, which was separated into 7 levels. Inside the library was a great amount of books, with an abundant amount of information. Aside from books about the continent\u2019s history, there were also many secret training manuals for practitioners. Students who had not yet reached Saint level would only be able to access the first two levels of the library. The moment a student reaches the level of a Saint and condenses his/her Saint Force into a Saint Weapon, then he/she would be able to enter the third and fourth levels. For any level above the fourth, the only people who could enter were teachers, or students at Great Saint level. \u2026\u2026. By the time Changyang Hu had finished telling Jian Chen about the information regarding the school, it was already quite late during the night. Changyang Hu thus hurried out of Jian Chen\u2019s dorm, and ran towards his own dormitory. Meanwhile, at the top of a tower that was situated in the center of Kargath Academy, the vice-headmaster Bai En respectfully stood in front of an office desk. In front of him, was actually the headmaster Jian Chen had met before. The headmaster of Kargath Academy extended his arm and stroked his long beard. Indifferently looking at the vice-headmaster, he said, \u201cBai En, did you say that the name of the freshman who won the competition was a kid called Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201d The headmaster\u2019s tone held a hint of surprise. Bai En nodded his head and said, \u201cYes, headmaster, I found out that Changyang Xiang Tian is quite remarkable. He is only at the 8th layer of Saint Force, but can already defeat freshmen that are at the 9th layer. His attacks are not only aggressive, but also quite agile and nimble. It also seems that he has plenty of combat experience, which does not match up with the strength he should have. Even Tie Ta, who has a body with heavenly force, lost to Jian Chen in a simple manner, unable to even counterattack\u201d Hearing this, the headmaster furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cBai En, is what you\u2019re saying really true? Is Changyang Xiang Tian really that amazing?\u201d \u201cHeadmaster, everything I said is the truth.\u201d said Bai En in a firm voice. The headmaster slowly rose from his chair and muttered, \u201cIt looks like this kid Changyang Xiang Tian is a bigger genius than Chang Bai said. He didn\u2019t use any sort of monster core or heavenly treasure, and was still able to reach the 8th layer of the Saint Force by the age of 15; how astonishing of a feat. To think that he also has an abundant amount of battle experience, something like this is unfathomable.\u201d Even the headmaster\u2019s voice carried a hint of astonishment. Hearing the headmaster mumble to himself, Bai En also had an astonished look on his face. The fact that he had not used any heavenly treasure or monster core to reach the 8th layer by the age of 15 was a type of talent within the Gesun Kingdom that could only be regarded as something a gifted genius could have. \u201cHeadmaster, it looks like this Changyang Xiang Tian has a limitless future.\u201d Bai En sighed. The headmaster nodded his head and said, \u201cAs long as he can continue to grow this way, then the skill he displayed today will definitely develop into something greater. It looks like our Kargath Academy will finally be able to boast of a strong individual, as long as he doesn\u2019t die on the road to greatness.\u201d \u201cAs long as he really grows into a strong individual of the Tian Yuan continent, then not only our Kargath Academy become well known, but our Gesun Kingdom\u2019s reputation within the continent would also increase. Right now, the surrounding kingdoms around us are getting more and more restless; after these 10 or so years, if our Gesun Kingdom doesn\u2019t have any strong individuals, then I\u2019m afraid that sooner or later, one of the kingdoms around us will attack.\u201d After hearing this, Bai En\u2019s face gradually grew solemn; the Gesun Kingdom was neither a big kingdom nor a small kingdom, but it had fertile lands that many of the surrounding kingdoms were envious of. If it were not for the 6 experts of Gesun Kingdom, then the surrounding kingdoms would have long since attacked them. Bai En pondered for a bit, before carefully asking, \u201cHeadmaster, should we consider giving away Class 1 and 2 Monster Cores to Changyang Xiang Tian for free then? That way, we could improve our relationship with him.\u201d The headmaster considered the vice headmaster\u2019s proposal for a bit, before shaking his head, \u201cThat won\u2019t be possible. Although using a monster core can be used to increase one\u2019s cultivation rate, there are side effects of abusing it. Changyang Xiang Tian is currently very young, we cannot allow him to become addicted to using monster cores. Otherwise, when he reaches the later levels, his foundation will be very shaky, which will obstruct his future progress. At his current age, he should quietly focus on self discipline; it would help lay down the foundations and increase his chance of success in making a breakthrough.\u201d \u201cYes, headmaster. Bai En understands what to do now.\u201d Bai En didn\u2019t dare to act against the headmaster. Besides, what the headmaster had said made plenty of sense. \u201cHeadmaster, how do you plan to handle Tie Ta?\u201d Bai En asked. \u201cTomorrow morning, bring Tie Ta to me. If he is willing, I will take him in as a personal disciple.\u201d The headmaster replied after thinking about it for a while. \u201cYes, headmaster!\u201d After Changyang Hu left his room, Jian Chen sat on his bed and contemplated the new information for a while. Afterwards, he crossed his legs, and with the Class 3 Monster Core in his hand, he began to absorb the energy from the Class 3 Monster Core into his body. Inside the monster core was the soul of a magical beast. The energy within was not only pure, but also fairly strong. According to what Changyang Hu had said, the moment Jian Chen started to absorb the monster core, then he would start to feel a long stream of pure and strong energy flowing out of the core. It would flow up through his arm, and slowly be absorbed within his body. Jian Chen manipulated the constant outward flow from the monster core to guide the energy into his body. Constantly refining the energy into his body, he gradually changed the energy into Saint Force, before gradually absorbing it into his dantian. Using a monster core to cultivate really did increase the cultivation rate by many times.. Because of the normal way of cultivation, one would normally have to absorb the World Essence slowly before finally converting to one\u2019s own energy, but that couldn\u2019t compare to the speed of a monster core. The natural Qi couldn\u2019t compare to the pure soul energy of a monster core; after all, the soul of a monster core was the purest part of the beast. Using the energy from a monster core, the speed of cultivation would increase by 10 times. For this reason, monster cores were extremely expensive, even if it was only a Class 1 Monster Core. Multiple rays of light gradually appeared between the sky and land. The bright red sun finally struggled to climb into the sky, sending forth the soft and warm rays of sunlight. The golden sunlight with tens of thousands of rays of light illuminated the earth, as if the whole ground was dyed into a golden carpet. At the same time, the Jian Chen who was sitting cross-legged on the bed slowly opened his eyes. His eyes showed a happy expression, and the corners of his mouth also showed a hint of a smile. After last night\u2019s cultivation, Jian Chen had received many gains, equivalent to a few days\u2019 worth of training. By absorbing the power within the Magical Stone, Jian Chen\u2019s cultivation speed had actually increased by 10 times. Right now, he could clearly feel that the Saint Power inside his body had increased by a ton. Based on his calculations, he wasn\u2019t far from reaching the 9th Saint Force layer. According to his current speed, at most it would only take a weekend\u2019s worth of time to reach the 9th Saint Force layer. Of course, this was only Jian Chen\u2019s estimate. The exact values had to be tested. If the fact that the amount of power that Jian Chen had absorbed from within the Magical Stone was 10 times more than the amount normally gained from cultivating was discovered by others, they would definitely be devastated from shock. Even though the Magical Stone could quickly increase the rate of cultivation, it was also far from achieving the frightening pace of 10 times faster under normal circumstances. The average person using the Magical Stone to cultivate would normally only increase cultivation rate by two or three times. Even if the person was slightly more powerful, his or her cultivation rate would only be raised by six or seven times. Considering the fact that Jian Chen\u2019s power wasn\u2019t even Saint level, the fact that he could increase his cultivation rate by ten times was definitely an extremely frightening pace. Seeing the Magic Stone in his hands, although the stone\u2019s color didn\u2019t change at all, Jian Chen clearly felt that the Magic Stone had shrunk by a circle after being gripped in his hand for the whole time. After leaving the dorm, Jian Chen directly arrived at the dining hall. This morning, the dining hall\u2019s breakfast was a bit more plentiful. Besides from a glass of magical beast milk, there was also some magical beast meat. Jian Chen had eaten quite a bit of magical beast meat in the Changyang household, and the taste was quite delicious. In his previous world, Jian Chen had never eaten such savory meat before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19: InconvenienceIn a flash, three days had already passed. Although the three days were not long, it still allowed Jian Chen to become more accustomed to the lifestyle and environment in Kargath Academy. Within these three days, other than Jian Chen participating in classes on the first day, he had spent his time on the other two days either cultivating in his room, or wandering around the library.Due to the fact that the curriculum taught by the teachers of the academy revolved around how one should behave, what should be done in a dangerous situation, and a few skills one would need in order to survive out in the areas outside the cities, Jian Chen felt that these things weren\u2019t even worth learning. He was a wanderer in his previous life; with his experience, he could teach those teachers how the class should be taught.With his battle experience and ability to live wherever in the world, he could teach both the teachers and the students by himself; as the teachers\u2019 experience with battle was not at all extensive, it could not even be compared to Jian Chen\u2019s.The next morning, Jian Chen put on the academy uniform and headed straight for the library after eating a meal at the dining hall. The academy was very lax about their classes; if one wanted to attend, then they could attend, if one didn\u2019t want to attend, then that was no problem either. After all, most of the nobles and children of rich families had already been tutored since young, so they had knowledge that could rival some of the teachers, but they lacked the experience. Therefore, the classes were pretty much only for the commoners to learn from. It was very rare that a noble would attend a class, and if they did, then it was a minor noble.Arriving at the first level of the library, Jian Chen took a few books, and began to eagerly read them at a table in the reading area.Kargath Academy\u2019s library was expansive, and there was a generous amount of books on almost every subject. It was vastly superior to the library back in Changyang Mansion, and Jian Chen could find many books that couldn\u2019t be found back at home, helping him understand the world to a better extent.Right now, the book in Jian Chen\u2019s hands was an introduction book to all of the magical beasts that could be found in the Tian Yuan continent. There were many different kinds of magical beasts; no matter if the beast could walk or fly, the amount of species amounted to over 1000. The book even mentioned that there were still many magical beasts left undiscovered, and for the magical beasts that didn\u2019t live within the deep abyss of the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts, then they lived in the endless ocean. That was an area that even the strongest of people had trouble traveling to.As Jian Chen immersed himself in studying, a 16-17 year old female student suddenly came walking through the doors. The female was extraordinarily pretty, and she also wore the academy uniform. Her long and beautiful hair was carefully braided into tiny ponytails, causing her face to look even more gorgeous. But on her face was an extremely haughty expression; one look at her would reveal that she was from a noble family.This female was actually Ka Di Qiuliu of the Ka Di Clan.Ka Di Qiuliu entered the library and walked over to the bookshelf, before casually walking on over the reading area with a book in hand. She glanced over at the other students reading there, but the moment her eyes swept over to the area with the tables, she saw the back of Jian Chen, causing her to immediately stop where she was and stand there in surprise.Ka Di Qiuliu focused onto Jian Chen\u2019s back, the light in her eyes never ceasing to flicker with emotion. Just thinking about how, a few days ago, she had been grabbed by the leg and casually thrown out of the arena without regard to her well-being, caused her to feel fury within herself. To her, that event was an unforgettable humiliation. The memory caused her face to boil over in anger before she snorted. No longer in the mood to read a book, she tossed it aside and stamped out of the library while gnashing at her teeth, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, hmph, I\u2019ll definitely show you one day!\u201dBut Jian Chen did not notice Ka Di Qiuliu at all, since he was completely focused on the book he was reading. No one would dare cause trouble in the library, so Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother keeping his guard up in it.After Ka Di Qiuli left the library, she immediately found her second brother, Ka Di Liang, who was practicing his martial arts alone in the forest.Seeing Ka Di Qiuli walkover, Ka Di Liang stopped his movements and laughed, \u201cThird sister, didn\u2019t you say you were going to the library? Why are you looking for me here then?\u201d In his heart, he still dearly loved his younger sister.Ka Di Qiuli walked up to him with a grimace, \u201cSecond brother, did you not say you would help me teach Changyang Xiang Tian a lesson?\u201dImmediately after hearing Changyang Xiang Tian, the smile on Ka Di Liang\u2019s face disappeared, and a gloomy expression replaced it. He had been brooding over the freshmen competition for the past few days, and since he had been defeated by an 8th Saint Force layer student in such an ugly way, Ka Di Liang would never forget feeling that memory. That very kick was the single memoriam of his disgrace.Ka Di Qiuli was furious as she spoke, \u201cSecond brother, Changyang Xiang Tian was in the library today; we should go over there and teach him a lesson!\u201d\u201cYes, of course; this time we will definitely be the winners. Come with me, third sister!\u201d Ka Di Liang started to walk towards the library with determination. There was no way he would admit defeat to Jian Chen; he had blamed his loss the other day due to his carelessness. It was because he had held back that he had lost to Jian Chen; this time the high and mighty Ka Di Liang would not accept defeat.Ka Di Qiuli started to show excitement. \u201cThis time, second brother must definitely give the brat Changyang Xiang Tian a lesson he\u2019ll never forget,\u201d she said, as she followed him to the library. Even though the two of them were both at the 9th layer of Saint Force, she knew that she was still no match for her older brother. And if Ka Di Liang were to lose against Changyang Xiang Tian, then there would be no way she would be able to win.At the library, Jian Chen was still deeply engrossed with his book.\u201cHello, do you mind if I sit down here?\u201d At this moment, a crisp voice came from the side of Jian Chen. Although he was deeply engrossed in his book, Jian Chen\u2019s soul was formidably strong, and brought him back to awareness.Reflexively turning his head, Jian Chen saw a 17-18 year old female standing right next to him. She wore an academy uniform, and had long black hair cascading down her shoulders. She had a refined, but kind smile, with eyes that looked curiously at Jian Chen. With her cherry red lips, there were people who were practically fighting each other to get closer to her. Although she was only 17-18, her body was so delicately refined that the academy uniform nicely accentuated her. Currently, the girl was hugging a thick book close to her.Jian Chen casually looked at her before turning around to look around the room; he hadn\u2019t realized that all of the tables were so full that not a single spot was left to sit down.Looking back to the beautiful female, Jian Chen answered, \u201cGo ahead!\u201d Returning his eyes back to his book, he didn\u2019t bother to look at her even though she was so pretty.The girl looked at the engrossed Jian Chen with a strange look. Her eyes shined with a peculiar look as she sat down, \u201cThank you!\u201d She said gently. Her voice was gentle sounding; anyone who heard her talk would feel comforted.Jian Chen didn\u2019t hear her words however, as he was already too absorbed in reading his book again. In his eyes, he could only see the book.The girl looked at Jian Chen with curiosity again, but she didn\u2019t say anything, and sat down with her book she was holding. She looked graceful as she slowly thumbed through her book, even though it was such a simple action. This gracefulness was an inherent talent of a noble, and suited her well.The library was very peaceful. Even though there weren\u2019t that many people, none of them made a sound, as they concentrated on their respective books.At that moment, a male and a female student came through the gates of the library\u2013it was the siblings, Ka Di Liang and Ka Di Qiuli.\u201cSecond brother, look, he\u2019s right over there.\u201d Ka Di Qiuli pointed at Jian Chen.Ka Di Liang looked to where Ka Di Qiuli was pointing, and sure enough, he saw the all too familiar body figure. He looked on with disdain as he advanced towards him with his head held high and an arrogant face. With his head high and chest out, he walked towards Jian Chen with Ka Di Qiuli closely trailing behind.\u201cPeng!\u201d The moment Ka Di Liang got to the table Jian Chen was at, he slammed his hand onto the table, causing a large sound to echo out into the previously silent room.The sudden noise attracted the attentions of all the people reading, and their gazes all moved away from their books one by one they began to observe Jian Chen\u2019s table. Aside from a few people furrowing their brows, most people carried amused expressions.Jian Chen knit his brows, and slowly lifted his head. He looked straight at Ka Di Liang, and said heavily with a hint of anger, \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dAt this moment, even the girl sitting across from Jian Chen had furrowed her brows, and she looked at Ka Di Liang in annoyance, her face also carrying hints of anger. The sudden loud noise by her ear had scared her while she was peacefully absorbed in reading her book.Ka Di Liang looked at Jian Chen with contempt, and haughtily said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I, Ka Di Liang, formally want to request a duel. Do you dare to accept?\u201d Ka Di Liang voice resonated through the entire first floor of the library, as if he were afraid nobody would be able to hear it.\u201cDuel!\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face showed a hint of disdain, and he lightly snorted, \u201cI\u2019m not interested, so please leave this area immediately. Don\u2019t disturb my reading; I don\u2019t have the luxury of wasting time on you!\u201dRealizing that Jian Chen was not seeing him as his equal, Ka Di Liang\u2019s eyes flashed with anger. Glaring at Jian Chen, he ground his teeth, and forcefully squeezed out the words, \u201cDo you dare to or not!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20: ChallengeJian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel fury from Ka Di Liang\u2019s arrogance. Holding his own head up to look at him with disdain, Jian Chen said, \u201cYou were defeated by me before, what right do you have to demand a challenge from me?\u201d Even now, Jian Chen\u2019s own tone carried a hint of arrogance that he had carried over from his previous world. This was a habitual attitude that somehow came out by accident.Hearing Jian Chen\u2019s words, Ka Di Liang\u2019s handsome face went deathly white. Extreme anger flashed through his eyes, but he didn\u2019t dare to break the pacifistic rules of the library; otherwise he would had long since attacked Jian Chen.Even Ka Di Qiuli, who was standing by her brother\u2019s side, was indignant. Glaring at Jian Chen, she started to jeer, \u201cHmph, you won\u2019t even accept my brother\u2019s challenge to a duel, what kind of man are you?\u201dHearing Ka Di Qiuli back him up, Ka Di Liang\u2019s eyes brightened up and felt reenergized, \u201cThat\u2019s right; not accepting a duel, that\u2019s what a coward does. Changyang Xiang Tian, I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the fighting arena. If you admit that you\u2019re a coward, then don\u2019t come. Third sister, let\u2019s go to the arena!\u201d After that, Ka Di Liang glared at Jian Chen before turning around to exit the library.\u201cHmph, Changyang Xiang Tian, you better come; you\u2019re a coward if you don\u2019t show up!\u201d Ka Di Qiuli cried out as she followed her brother.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, isn\u2019t that the new Freshmen Ruler from the competition\u2026?\u201d\u201cSeems about right, I heard that Changyang Xiang Tian is at the 8th Saint Force layer but he ended up beating several students who were a layer higher, how amazing\u2026\u201dAfter Ka Di Qiuli left, the entire library started to buzz with comments. Everyone was starting to comment about the Freshman Ruler, Changyang Xiang Tian.Even the girl who was sitting next to Jian Chen had a small look of astonishment as she looked at him. Her eyes were blinking rapidly from this development, and it was clear to see that she had not expected Jian Chen to be the Freshmen Ruler.Jian Chen slowly clasped shut the book in his hand, with a face that was unsightly to see. After the two siblings from the Ka Di clan disturbed him, he was no longer in the mood to read. Plus, Jian Chen had no other choice but to accept the challenge after it was issued, otherwise the entire academy would look down on him. Although Jian Chen didn\u2019t really care about his own reputation, he was one of the symbols of the Changyang clan. Since his older brother wasn\u2019t around, he would have to take up the challenge himself to make sure the Changyang clan didn\u2019t get sullied. At the same time, Jian Chen didn\u2019t want Changyang Hu to be ridiculed for having such a cowardly brother.Slowly standing up from his chair, he grabbed the few books he had with him and returned them to the bookshelf. After the books were neatly shelved, Jian Chen began to walk out of the library. At that moment, the entire library watched Jian Chen\u2019s movements.\u201cHey, Changyang Xiang Tian!\u201d As Jian Chen reached the gates of the library, the female who was sitting next to him called out to him.Turning around in surprise, Jian Chen looked at the beautiful girl with an even look, \u201cYes?\u201dHearing the even tone in his voice, the girl couldn\u2019t help but pout, but she didn\u2019t stay anything and instead walked up to Jian Chen and said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, are you really going to accept his challenge at the arena?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Jian Chen nodded.\u201cYou don\u2019t actually have to accept his challenge at all. The library banned any sort of loud noises, so those people have already violated the rules imposed by the academy. You could just go and report this to the headmaster, and he\u2019ll definitely penalize those two. In Kargath Academy, no one has ever dared to go against the headmaster\u2019s command,\u201d the girl said.Hearing these words, Jian Chen started to look at the girl in a better light. With a light laugh, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve already issued the challenge, so I have to accept!\u201d After saying that, he said no more, and left the library.As the girl watched Jian Chen\u2019s figure disappear, her eyes quickly flashed. After some hesitation, she immediately ran to the table she had been sitting to return the thick book she had been reading back to the shelves, and ran out of the library, towards the martial arts arena.After the girl left, the entire library was silent for a moment. Suddenly, a loud voice range out, \u201cThere\u2019s another interesting scene to watch. A freshman at the 8th Saint Force layer is battling against a person at the 9th Saint Force layer; anyone who doesn\u2019t watch it would be a fool.\u201d A male in his teens wearing the school uniform said as he directly ran out of the libraryAfter both these people had left, the few other students that had been reading in the library also returned the books in their hands to the shelves, and left the library one after another, running towards the martial arts arena.The school\u2019s martial arts arena was constructed in a corner of the sports field. Within it, there were five circular platforms, each one being approximately 20 meters in diameter. However, the insides of the martial arts arena was not that large, and could only comfortable fit 100 spectators. Otherwise, the freshmen martial arts competition a few days ago wouldn\u2019t have been held at the temporarily modified stages on the sports field.When Jian Chen arrived at the martial arts arena, he only saw Ka Di Liang standing on one of the platforms with his arms crossed, with an arrogant expression on his face. Standing below the platform were Ka Di Qiuli and a few other students wearing the academy uniforms, who were all absorbed in deep discussions.Seeing Jian Chen arriving from the distance, Ka Di Liang, who was standing on the platform, sneered at him and shouted, \u201cAnd here I had thought that you were a coward and had not dared to come.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d Jian Chen snorted in disdain, and directly jumped onto the platform. He stood on the platform with his arms crossed, and coldly replied, \u201cCome at me. I\u2019ll allow you to attack me 10 times. During these 10 attacks, I will not retaliate.\u201dHearing Jian Chen\u2019s arrogant words, the spectators below the platform began to cry out in shock, and began to talk amongst themselves in low voices. There were many elder students amid the spectators, and amongst them, quite a few did not have positive opinions about Jian Chen. They believed that during the freshmen martial arts competition, the only reason why Jian Chen had defeating Ka Di Liang was because Ka Di Liang had been too careless.Ka Di Liang\u2019s eye glinted with anger. Anyone could tell that Jian Chen\u2019s words meant that he did not see Ka Di Liang as his equal.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re even more savage than I had thought,\u201d Ka Di Liang said forcefully.Jian Chen looked indifferently at Ka Di Liang, and replied, \u201cIf you want to fight, then hurry up. I don\u2019t have the time to waste on you!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d Ka Di Liang grunted, and sneered, \u201cWhy are you so rushed? Let\u2019s wait until everyone gathers here; I want everyone to witness the moment I defeat you.\u201d Because he had lost last time during the freshmen martial arts competition, Ka Di Liang had been brooding over it for a while, especially since Jian Chen had even kicked him in the butt. To him, this was an unforgettable humiliation. In Ka Di Liang\u2019s opinion, he always felt that the only reason he had lost to Jian Chen was because he had been too careless. Thus, he wanted to take this chance to regain the face that he had previously lost, and aimed to ruthlessly humiliate Jian Chen in return.Gradually, the people surrounding the martial arts arena increased, and the population did not cease to increase either. From the distance, there were still many students heading towards the arena. This match had obviously been announced to the public by Ka Di Liang.After only a short while had passed, the martial arts arena was packed with 200 or so people. Nearly everyone was excited to watch the lively scene. Amongst these people, Ka Di Liang\u2019s older brother, Ka Di Yun, also stood there, with a few people around his age standing next to him.\u201cFourth brother, you can do it. Big Brother is watching you!\u201d Suddenly, a familiar deep sound mixed amongst the other noises was clearly transmitted to the platform.Hearing this, Jian Chen turned around, and saw his older brother Changyang Hu standing beneath the platform cheering for him.Jian Chen smiled, and wordlessly nodded his head at Changyang Hu.At that moment, someone banged on the table and shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s make bets, bets! Whoever wants to wager on the fight, come here!\u201d\u201cI bet on Ka Di Liang, 10 gold coins\u2026\u201d\u201cI bet on Changyang Xiang Tian, 20 gold coins\u2026\u201d\u201c50 gold coins on Ka Di Liang\u2026\u201dPeople gradually started to gamble on the outcome of the match between Jian Chen and Ka Di Liang. Even those who usually attended class had came along with many nobles. Money was of no issue to them, so there were many people betting from 10 Gold coins to 10 Purple coins. Around 80% of the gamblers were betting on Ka Di Liang, and only 20% were betting on Jian Chen.\u201cTen Purple coins on Changyang Xiang Tian!\u201d Changyang Hu slammed down the appropriate amount of coins onto the table.\u201cI\u2019ll bet on Changyang Xiang Tian as well, 10 Purple coins!\u201d Behind Changyang Xiang Tian, a soft and gentle voice spoke. It was the girl from the library who sat next to Jian Chen. She was obviously from a big clan; with every word she spoke, her tone was filled with a grandeur sound that sounded natural to her.After the girl had bet 10 Purple coins on Changyang Xiang Tian, everyone else started to show expressions of surprise. Changyang Hu was the older brother of Changyang Xiang Tian, so his bet was easy to understand. However, this girl did not hesitate at all when she wagered her money. Despite their shock however, no student voiced out their questions.On the platform, Jian Chen looked at Ka Di Liang with a strange expression and said, \u201cWe can start now, right?\u201dKa Di Liang held an expression filled with self-confidence, and he sneered, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you personally declared that you would allow me to attack 10 times. You\u2019d better not go back on your words.\u201d\u201cA nobleman\u2019s word is his bond. Just give me all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Jian Chen replied.TL: He uses a proverb to say this.\u201cHow arrogant!\u201d Although Ka Di Liang didn\u2019t quite understand the fancy proverb Jian Chen had said, but he could roughly guess the meaning of it. Without another word, he dashed at Jian Chen to start the fight. Since Jian Chen had allowed him ten moves, he wouldn\u2019t hold back and unleash his strongest moves.Ka Di Liang quickly rushed in front of Jian Chen, and struck out with his fist that traveled through the air so fast, a whistling sound could be heard.Faced with the fist, Jian Chen only took a single step back, and allowed the fist to stop short of him before it could make contact.\u201cHu\u2026.how close\u2026.just a bit more and he would\u2019ve been hit\u2026\u201d\u201cThis Changyang Xiang Tian can\u2019t be too powerful. As soon as the duel started, he was almost hit. If any of those punches connect, I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t get off with just some minor damages, and the victor would already be clear.\u201d\u201cThis Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s luck is quite good, to have dodged it like that\u2026.\u201dEveryone under the arena had thought that Jian Chen was merely lucky to have dodged Ka Di Liang\u2019s fist, and so only a few observers had realized the truth, causing them to start to look at Jian Chen in a new light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he immediately went back into motion, and flung a kick at Jian Chen.In a flash, 10 moves had passed without Jian Chen retaliating, and every single move from Ka Di Liang had been easily dodged. But to everyone else that was watching, Jian Chen had been narrowly dodging each move by the skin of his teeth, causing everyone watching, including Changyang Hu, to break out in cold sweat as they watched in anxiety.Ka Di Liang\u2019s attacks were fairly fast and furious, but none of the 10 moves he had lashed out with even touched Jian Chen\u2019s clothes. Having not landed a single blow, Ka Di Liang was angry beyond belief.Finally lifting a fist to block Ka Di Liang\u2019s fist, Jian Chen spoke, \u201c10 moves have passed, it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Without waiting for a response, he aimed a kick at Ka Di Liang.The speed in which his leg was moving was extremely fast; there wasn\u2019t even enough time for Ka Di Liang to dodge. By the time he tried to move his hand up to block, Jian Chen\u2019s leg had already smashed against Ka Di Liang\u2019s chest.\u201cDeng!\u201d \u201cDeng!\u201d \u201cDeng!\u201dThe force of Jian Chen\u2019s leg caused Ka Di Liang to stumble backwards. As he steadied himself Ka Di Liang gave Jian Chen a dumbstruck look; although Jian Chen was only at the 8th Saint Force layer, Jian Chen\u2019s strength had far surpassed his expectations. It wasn\u2019t something Ka Di Liang would be able to endure.In the last fight during the competition, Ka Di Liang had never exchanged blows with Jian Chen, so he never understood the true extent of Jian Chen\u2019s strength. It was not until this fight that Ka Di Liang realized that Jian Chen was stronger than he looked. In fact, based on the strength of the kick just now, Ka Di Liang was starting to doubt that Jian Chen was only at the 8th Saint Force layer.Perhaps Jian Chen also wanted to end this battle quickly, because he didn\u2019t give Ka Di Liang time to even gasp before he quickly slammed his fist into Ka Di Liang\u2019s nose.Ka Di Liang\u2019s face hardened as he stood back up, his entire body tried to stand against Jian Chen\u2019s fist before he tried to smash his fist against Jian Chen\u2019s head.Jian Chen let out a cold laugh before blocking the fist with his own hand. Grabbing onto Ka Di Liang\u2019s shoulder with his other hand, he got into a horse stance, and grabbed onto him with his right arm. Grabbing tightly, he exerted some force and sent Ka Di Liang flying away.In his previous life, Jian Chen had learned wrestling techniques from the Mongols, so he was fairly proficient at it. He had used it many times, and gained experience in it so much, that it was ingrained into his memory. Jian Chen learned many different skills other than just swordplay, and was fairly proficient at every single thing he put his mind towards.Ka Di Liang\u2019s body was almost like a feather as he flew through the air, thanks to Jian Chen. He flew 4-5 meters into the air before finally falling back down to the arena.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dHe saw Jian Chen to be weak, but somehow, Jian Chen had managed to accomplish such a feat with his delicate-looking figure. Likewise, the audience around the arena let out gasps of shock as they started to reevaluate their opinions about Jian Chen. Seeing the two fight it out like this made it so that no one would ever dare to underestimate Jian Chen in the future.The faces of Ka Di Yun and Ka Di Qiuli both gradually turned quite ugly. The situation was far beyond what they had expected it to be.\u201cHeng! Changyang Xian Tian, you actually are a slightly skilled,\u201d Ka Di Yun said in a low voice, while angrily gritting his teeth.Ka Di Liang stood back up pathetically on the ring with a cloudy looking face. He looked at Jian Chen\u2019s eyes with a gaze filled with poison.\u201cAhh!\u201d Ka Di Liang roared, focusing all his power of the 9th level of Saint Force in the center of his two palms. He quickly rushed towards Jian Chen with both his arms pressing towards Jian Chen\u2019s chest, and attacked.Jian Chen sneered, and as he condensed all his Saint Force onto his palms as well, he suddenly threw his own hands towards Ka Di Liang\u2019s, resulting in a collision between both pairs of hands.\u201cPeng!\u201dAs the sound came echoing out, Jian Chen and Ka Di Liang were stuck in a deadlock. Their fists had slammed so hard against each other, a mini shockwave pushed both of them backwards.Jian Chen didn\u2019t stop there; his legs began to blur as he skillfully maneuvered to counter the shock. Looking at the rapidly retreating Ka Di Liang, Jian Chen immediately dashed forward and leapt up from the ground, both of his legs kicking out at Ka Di Liang.Before Ka Di Liang could regain his footing, he was unable to block the attack. As he was kicked in the stomach by Jian Chen, Ka Di Liang was sent flying once more.\u201cPff!\u201d Hitting the ground, Ka Di Liang\u2019s face went white from the pain as he began to spit out some blood. He had started to take in heavy amounts of damage.\u201cYounger brother!\u201d\u201cOlder brother!\u201dKa Di Yun and Ka Di Qiuli ran up to Kai Di Liang\u2019s side on the ground. Picking him up, they grimaced and looked at him with concern as they saw the small trickle of blood from the corner of Ka Di Liang\u2019s mouth.\u201cYounger brother, are you ok?\u201d Ka Di Yun asked. His face was relatively unsightly to look at, although the situation was different from last time, since Ka Di Liang had been careless during the first match with Jian Chen. However, this second time was different. This time Ka Di Liang was fighting with Jian Chen using all of his strength, which was stronger than 80% of the other 9th Saint Force Layer students.\u201cOlder brother, how are you feeling, are you seriously hurt?\u201d Ka Di Qiuli asked with a voice full of concern.Ka Di Liang was helped to his feet by his two siblings. Lightly shaking his head, he said, \u201cEldest brother, third sister, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve only suffered from minor injuries.\u201d But even as he said that, his two siblings could detect a small tinge of weakness in his voice.Looking at Ka Di Liang\u2019s pale face, Ka Di Yun grew angry. Raising his head to look at the elevated Jian Chen, he growled, \u201cThird sister, you take care of second brother. I\u2019ll go teach that arrogant brat a lesson!\u201d Leaving his siblings, he walked up into the arena to confront him.\u201cEldest brother, you shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cEldest brother, you can\u2019t\u2026\u201dKa Di Liang and Ka Di Qiuli tried to block his path, but unfortunately, they didn\u2019t reach him in time. The two siblings let out a sigh. No matter if Ka Di Yun won or lost now, the Ka Di clan would lose some prestige within the academy. This was originally a fair battle, so if they had lost, then they wouldn\u2019t have felt any negative side effects other than losing some face. But now that Ka Di Yun was going to fight, the whole situation was different. If news about a freshman immediately being bullied by some seniors straight after entering the academy was spread throughout the entire academy, then the three siblings would be mocked and ridiculed by the whole academy..Jian Chen stared at Ka Di Yun as he leapt up onto the stage and sneered, \u201cAre you here to avenge your brother?\u201dAngrily glaring at Jian Chen, he said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you really are strong. However, you\u2019ve injured my brother; therefore, I won\u2019t let you leave this place unharmed.\u201dThe people around the stage all creased their foreheads as they listened to him. Their opinions about Ka Di Yun had now changed.\u201cKa Di Yun, what is the meaning of this, do you plan to bully the Changyang clan until no one remains?\u201d A deep voice called out as another person walked onto the arena. Turning around,Jian Chen felt relieved to see it was his older brother, Changyang Hu.Changyang Hu stared at Ka Di Yun intensely, \u201cKa Di Yun, if you want to fight, then you\u2019ll have to fight me first.\u201dJian Chen felt a wave of warmth encompass his body as he listened to his brother back him up. \u201cBig brother, you should head back down, I can handle this myself.\u201dChangyang Hu shook his head in response to him. \u201cNo can do, fourth brother, it should be you that should head down. Ka Di Yun\u2019s strength has long since reached the peak of the Saint Force level. You are no match for him, so let your big brother help you.\u201dAfter hesitating a bit from these words, Jian Chen nodded, \u201cThen big brother, please be careful.\u201d Saying this, Jian Chen walked off the arena.Ka Di Yun sneered in disdain as he watched Jian Chen exit the arena, \u201cChangyang Hu, you\u2019re just asking for trouble, so don\u2019t blame me for anything that happens.\u201d\u201cHmph, you\u2019re saying this far too early. Whoever the winner is and whoever the loser is isn\u2019t certain yet.\u201d Changyang Hu replied. He and Ka Di Yun had long since reached the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer, so if Ka Di Yun didn\u2019t condense his Saint Force into a Saint Weapon, then their strengths would be equal.Ka Di Yun let loose a ridiculing expression as he looked at the disdain on Changyang Hu\u2019s face. Lifting his right arm, a large golden colored stream of energy started to focus onto his right arm and condensed into a great golden sword. The golden sword was quite large, and measured around 5 feet long and a single palm spread wide. Judging from the length of the handle, the sword was meant to be held with both hands.Looking at Ka Di Yun grab the sword with both hands, Jian Chen\u2019s eyebrows furrowed together in concern. He had read up on Saint Weapons back in the Changyang Mansion. He could easily see that this was Ka Di Yun\u2019s Saint Weapon, and that this was also the first Saint Weapon that Jian Chen had ever seen since he first arrived in this new world. He had long since understood that a Saint Weapon was the condensed version of one\u2019s Saint Force, but seeing this with his own eyes, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel amazed. To think that the Saint Force could be condensed in such a way, it felt almost like a fantasy. This made Jian Chen feel extremely excited.The moment the golden two hand sword appeared, everyone cried out in surprise and admiration.\u201cA Saint Weapon, he really did condense one\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo he already broke through into the Saint level\u2026\u201d\u201cKa Di Yun became a Saint, Changyang Hu will be in trouble now\u2026\u201dThe distance between the peak of the 10th layer to Sainthood wasn\u2019t that far, but it was nonetheless very difficult to cross over. Within the Kargath Academy, the majority of the seniors had all reached the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer, but were unable to condense their Saint Force into Saint Weapons. If one didn\u2019t have the talent that surpassed a regular person\u2019s, then it would be extremely difficult for him/her to make a breakthrough. Within the Tian Yuan continent, it was not rare to see many practitioners to be stuck at the 10th layer until the end of their lives, without being able to become a Saint. From this one could see that successfully becoming a Saint was a truly difficult achievement.Also, once one broke through to becoming a Saint, his/her strength would be increased by a large amount. A Saint Weapon wasn\u2019t one\u2019s only weapon; one could use his/her emotions to directly fuel his/her abilities in order to use attacks that far surpassed one\u2019s original strength.Looking at Ka Di Yun\u2019s golden sword, Changyang Hu\u2019s face became extremely unsightly. Now that Ka Di Yun possessed a Saint Weapon, his strength could overturn the heavens; a person at the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer definitely wouldn\u2019t be a match for him.\u201cBig brother really did condense a Saint Weapon!\u201d Below the arena, Ka Di Qiuli was pleasantly surprised, as she watched Ka Di Yun wave his Saint Weapon around.Ka Di Liang had an envious look on his face as he stared at the Saint Weapon, but he too was pleasantly surprised. Both siblings had not realized that their eldest sibling had reached the Saint level until this moment.Holding the Saint Weapon, Ka Di Yun\u2019s confidence in himself was boosted to unprecedented levels. As Changyang Hu\u2019s face grew darker and darker, Ka Di Yun\u2019s face became even haughtier. The pleasure Ka Di Yun felt in his heart was indescribable.\u201cHahahaha, Changyang Hu, are you afraid now? If you kneel down and kowtow to the ground three times and call me your elder then I\u2019ll spare you. If you don\u2019t then\u2026hmph, you\u2019ll know what the end result will be.\u201d Ka Di Yun laughed crazily, his tone savage..Changyang Hu\u2019s face ashened as he listened to Ka Di Yun\u2019s demands. Snarling, he answered, \u201cDream on, Ka Di Yun. Even if you\u2019re a Saint now, I, Changyang Hu, will never be afraid of you.\u201dKa Di Yun looked at Changyang Hu arrogantly, and casually said, \u201cChangyang Hu, what will you use to fight me with then?\u201dChangyang Hu angrily glared at Ka Di Yun, fury blazing in his eyes.\u201cChangyang Hu, your sword!\u201dAt that moment, a sword came flying out from the audience below the arena.Changyang Hu grabbed the iron sword while settling into a stance. The sword was not light at all, and was of a fairly long size. The silver white sword sparkled in the light in all 4 directions, and aside from the color, there were few differences between Ka Di Yun\u2019s sword and Changyang Hu\u2019s sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You are no match for him, so let your big brother help you.\u201dAfter hesitating a bit from these words, Jian Chen nodded, \u201cThen big brother, please be careful.\u201d Saying this, Jian Chen walked off the arena.Ka Di Yun sneered in disdain as he watched Jian Chen exit the arena, \u201cChangyang Hu, you\u2019re just asking for trouble, so don\u2019t blame me for anything that happens.\u201d\u201cHmph, you\u2019re saying this far too early. Whoever the winner is and whoever the loser is isn\u2019t certain yet.\u201d Changyang Hu replied. He and Ka Di Yun had long since reached the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer, so if Ka Di Yun didn\u2019t condense his Saint Force into a Saint Weapon, then their strengths would be equal.Ka Di Yun let loose a ridiculing expression as he looked at the disdain on Changyang Hu\u2019s face. Lifting his right arm, a large golden colored stream of energy started to focus onto his right arm and condensed into a great golden sword. The golden sword was quite large, and measured around 5 feet long and a single palm spread wide. Judging from the length of the handle, the sword was meant to be held with both hands.Looking at Ka Di Yun grab the sword with both hands, Jian Chen\u2019s eyebrows furrowed together in concern. He had read up on Saint Weapons back in the Changyang Mansion. He could easily see that this was Ka Di Yun\u2019s Saint Weapon, and that this was also the first Saint Weapon that Jian Chen had ever seen since he first arrived in this new world. He had long since understood that a Saint Weapon was the condensed version of one\u2019s Saint Force, but seeing this with his own eyes, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel amazed. To think that the Saint Force could be condensed in such a way, it felt almost like a fantasy. This made Jian Chen feel extremely excited.The moment the golden two hand sword appeared, everyone cried out in surprise and admiration.\u201cA Saint Weapon, he really did condense one\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo he already broke through into the Saint level\u2026\u201d\u201cKa Di Yun became a Saint, Changyang Hu will be in trouble now\u2026\u201dThe distance between the peak of the 10th layer to Sainthood wasn\u2019t that far, but it was nonetheless very difficult to cross over. Within the Kargath Academy, the majority of the seniors had all reached the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer, but were unable to condense their Saint Force into Saint Weapons. If one didn\u2019t have the talent that surpassed a regular person\u2019s, then it would be extremely difficult for him/her to make a breakthrough. Within the Tian Yuan continent, it was not rare to see many practitioners to be stuck at the 10th layer until the end of their lives, without being able to become a Saint. From this one could see that successfully becoming a Saint was a truly difficult achievement.Also, once one broke through to becoming a Saint, his/her strength would be increased by a large amount. A Saint Weapon wasn\u2019t one\u2019s only weapon; one could use his/her emotions to directly fuel his/her abilities in order to use attacks that far surpassed one\u2019s original strength.Looking at Ka Di Yun\u2019s golden sword, Changyang Hu\u2019s face became extremely unsightly. Now that Ka Di Yun possessed a Saint Weapon, his strength could overturn the heavens; a person at the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer definitely wouldn\u2019t be a match for him.\u201cBig brother really did condense a Saint Weapon!\u201d Below the arena, Ka Di Qiu Li was pleasantly surprised, as she watched Ka Di Yun wave his Saint Weapon around.Ka Di Liang had an envious look on his face as he stared at the Saint Weapon, but he too was pleasantly surprised. Both siblings had not realized that their eldest sibling had reached the Saint level until this moment.Holding the Saint Weapon, Ka Di Yun\u2019s confidence in himself was boosted to unprecedented levels. As Changyang Hu\u2019s face grew darker and darker, Ka Di Yun\u2019s face became even haughtier. The pleasure Ka Di Yun felt in his heart was indescribable.\u201cHahahaha, Changyang Hu, are you afraid now? If you kneel down and kowtow to the ground three times and call me your elder then I\u2019ll spare you. If you don\u2019t then\u2026hmph, you\u2019ll know what the end result will be.\u201d Ka Di Yun laughed crazily, his tone savage..Changyang Hu\u2019s face ashened as he listened to Ka Di Yun\u2019s demands. Snarling, he answered, \u201cDream on, Ka Di Yun. Even if you\u2019re a Saint now, I, Changyang Hu, will never be afraid of you.\u201dKa Di Yun looked at Changyang Hu arrogantly, and casually said, \u201cChangyang Hu, what will you use to fight me with then?\u201dChangyang Hu angrily glared at Ka Di Yun, fury blazing in his eyes.\u201cChangyang Hu, your sword!\u201dAt that moment, a sword came flying out from the audience below the arena.Changyang Hu grabbed the iron sword while settling into a stance. The sword was not light at all, and was of a fairly long size. The silver white sword sparkled in the light in all 4 directions, and aside from the color, there were few differences between Ka Di Yun\u2019s sword and Changyang Hu\u2019s sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23: Becoming Popular Because of SkillThe moment that Ka Di Yun felt pain, he swung out with his other hand at Jian Chen\u2019s arms, while aiming his left leg at Jian Chen\u2019s groin.Even though one of his arms was useless, Ka Di Yun was still able to launcha counterattack. Even with this unsightly scene, Ka Di Yun had some experience with battles and tried to escape this situation.Seeing a flurry of arms and legs flashing before his eyes, Jian Chen knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to directly take the attacks head on. He helplessly let go of Ka Di Yun\u2019s arm, and used the Profound Steps to retreat. He managed to dodge Ka Di Yun\u2019s attack and circled around to his back, before using his Saint Force to amplify his attack on Ka Di Yun\u2019s back.TL note: Profound Steps was mentioned earlier back in his room in the Changyang Mansion, it\u2019s basically him moving fast.Feeling the strong wind behind his back, Ka Di Yun didn\u2019t hesitate for a second and evaded Jian Chen by diving to the side. However, even as he dodged, Ka Di Yun was amazed. No matter where he moved, he would always feel a wind blowing on his back; he wasn\u2019t able to keep up with Jian Chen\u2019s movements.\u201cPeng!\u201dKa Di Yun was completely unable to keep up with Jian Chen, who smashed both of his hands into Ka Di Yun\u2019s back, creating a cracking sound as he was hit by a violent attack. This caused Ka Di Yun to stagger two steps forward, but since he was a strong Saint, he immediately steadied himself. However, his face had already paled, as he realized that Jian Chen had hit the same place twice with his fists. Jian Chen\u2019s strength could already be measured at the peak of the 9th layer, and despite Ka Di Yun being stronger than him in rank, he was the one being injured more. At that moment, he could only feel a surge of Qi and blood course through his body, his organs screaming in pain.As Ka Di Yun steadied himself, Jian Chen had already arrived at his backside another time, and struck at his back with his right hand once more. Although the fist traveled at a speed that made it look like it was as light as a feather, the effect was anything but light. Anyone that had faced off against Jian Chen before would agree that Jian Chen\u2019s strength was more extraordinary than it looked.Ka Di Yun turned around abruptly, his eyes were indignant with anger. For a strong person like him to suffer this much from someone who was by all rights weaker than him, his simple plan to humiliate Jian Chen was no longer as simple as he thought.\u201cHa!\u201d Ka Di Yun snarled in anger, as his hand started to glow golden with his Saint Force. The huge concentration of Saint Force condensed into his hand as he faced Jian Chen, aiming it towards Jian Chen\u2019s chest. Seeing Jian Chen attack with a seemingly light fist, Ka Di Yun prepared to take it head on in order to get close to Jian Chen for his own attack.The situation turned into a critical point of the match, as both the fighter\u2019s attacks struck each other. Jian Chen\u2019s seemingly light and weak fist silently struck against Ka Di Yun\u2019s chest. Immediately, Ka Di Yun\u2019s own fist let out a muffled sound as it struck against Jian Chen\u2019s body, blowing apart a hole in the academy uniform, and revealing a tender white skin that would be the target of envy by many of the girls. But in the blink of an eye, the skin underneath became a pile of bruises after receiving Ka Di Yun\u2019s blow.\u201cDeng!\u201d \u201cDeng!\u201d \u201cDeng!\u201dAfter receiving a blow from Ka Di Yun, Jian Chen\u2019s face contorted in pain, and the color started to drain away from his face. And with the blow being enforced by such a huge amount of strength, his legs weren\u2019t enough to prevent him from sliding back, until he was a few inches away from the edge of the arena. At this moment, other than his paling face, Jian Chen did not seem to have any other problems, despite Ka Di Yun using his Saint Force to accentuate his attack.Although Jian Chen was only at the 8th layer, because he had been using Azulet Sword Law to constantly cultivate his body since he was young, he had strengthened every single organ and part of his body to the utmost degree. So while on the outside, it seemed that Jian Chen\u2019s physical body was quite weak, his actual ability to resist and take damage would leave anyone flabbergasted. Even though Ka Di Yun was a Saint, without using his Saint Weapon, his regular attacks would not be able to seriously wound Jian Chen; at the most, Jian Chen would sport some small bruises.On the other hand, while Ka Di Yun was standing at the same place, his face had scrunched up in major pain as his body began to visibly tremble from the pain he was feeling.Before, Jian Chen\u2019s fist that seemed to be as light as a feather, impacted against his stomach and caused a peculiar feeling to be transferred over into him. The power forcibly entered his body and suddenly went berserk as it exploded within him, causing his internal body to go crazy from the pain.Ka Di Yun\u2019s face became incomparably dark, as he used all the Saint Force within his body began to combat the power that was rebelling inside. Since his Saint Force was stronger than Jian Chen\u2019s, the foreign power within him was cleared away quickly, but the damage was done. At this point, Ka Di Yun was suffering from internal damages as well. The damages weren\u2019t very serious, but it would definitely impact his performance in the battle for the worse if it dragged on.Ka Di Yun glared at the calm Jian Chen in front of him with a shocked expression. He hadn\u2019t ever imagined that he would be put in such a difficult spot as a Saint by someone who was lower ranked than him. Although he wasn\u2019t using his Saint Weapon, his strength was still stronger than those at the peak of the 10th layer, let alone the 8th layer Jian Chen.At that moment, Ka Di Yun finally realized how hard it was to deal with Jian Chen, but it was too late to stop. Over the past few confrontations, he understood that without using the Saint Weapon, he would have a difficult time beating Jian Chen and might even lose to him. With the Saint Weapon he would definitely win against him, but that wouldn\u2019t be a bright situation. Besides, he had also clearly stated that he wouldn\u2019t use a Saint Weapon against Jian Chen. If he went back on his word now, then even if he won, his reputation would plummet to the bottom. After all, there were plenty of people watching the match, along with some seniors. Not only that but he was Ka Di Yun\u2013Gesun Kingdom\u2019s elite elder son of the Ka Di clan; he couldn\u2019t lose face now.Ka Di Yun was starting to reflect on his actions now, but then Jian Chen decided to charge at him with both his arms outstretched. Rapidly approaching, Jian Chen was using a weird technique to cause his moves to become unpredictable and made him look like a bolt of lightning. In Ka Di Yun\u2019s eyes, Jian Chen had become an after image.Ka Di Yun narrowly blocked Jian Chen\u2019s strike. His right arm was dislocated, and he hadn\u2019t had enough time to pop it back into place, so he could only use his left hand to block against Jian Chen\u2019s attacks. Because of this, in face of Jian Chen\u2019s Saint Force, Ka Di Yun fell from his invincible position, and began to fight back earnestly now. He no longer belittled Jian Chen, and started to view him as an opponent of the same level.The two people continued to fight at a fast paced speed; the battlefield became fierce. Jian Chen didn\u2019t dare to hold back since Ka Di Yun\u2019s strength was much stronger than his own. With both of them in a deadlock, the two could only defend against each other.Jian Chen\u2019s attacks were getting stronger and stronger, while Ka Di Yun was finding it harder and harder to resist . Gradually in front of Ka Di Yun\u2019s eyes, all he could see were the palms of Jian Chen\u2019s hands; his eyes were getting too tired to differentiate between the after images of Jian Chen, and he could only rely on his listening abilities to tell when and where Jian Chen would attack.Finally, Ka Di Yun became careless, and Jian Chen struck out at his left shoulder with a powerful strike. Ka Di Yun couldn\u2019t help but lag behind, as Jian Chen began to bombard him with a plethora of attacks. It was almost as if Ka Di Yun was in a very violent storm where he was battered from every angle.\u201cPeng!\u201d \u201cPeng!\u201d \u201cPeng!\u201dJian Chen repeatedly hit Ka Di Yun on the shoulder with ferocious attacks, and even Ka Di Yun\u2019s strong Saint power could not bear the attacks. He constantly retreated. and a trace of blood trickled out of Ka Di Yun\u2019s mouth.Seeing that Ka Di Yun was already driven to the edge of the arena, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes fiercely flashed. Growling, Jian Chen gathered the Saint Force into his hand and struck Ka Di Yun in the chest another time. This fist was a lot stronger than the last, and the moment the fist connected, Ka Di Yun fell from the arena down onto the ground below.Jian Chen stood on the arena while breathing heavily. Since he was constantly using his entire strength, he had exhausted his supply of Saint Force, to the point where had had almost none left within his body. If Ka Di Yun did not accept defeat here and now, then Jian Chen would not be able to maintain his odds of winning for long.The arena became quiet, as everyone stared at the lone figure standing on top of the arena. At this moment, everyone showed incomprehensible expressions. This had already exceeded anyone\u2019s wildest guess, and no one had thought that Jian Chen would win against a Saint. Most importantly, he had defeated a Saint while coming out almost unharmed. Even though the Saint didn\u2019t use a Saint Weapon, this outcome was no less surprising nor predictable.At this moment, the arena was completely silent, so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. There were over 200 people that were watching, but not a single person dared to make a sound.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u201dA voice finally broke the spell of silence over the arena as the Ka Di siblings sped over to where Ka Di Yun lay on the floor.As if awakened, everyone started to burst into noise, as if the seal of a pot had been broken. All around the arena, people were chattering away noisily with excitement and shock.\u201cHeavens, I\u2019m not dreaming, an 8th layer student managed to beat a Saint. This is an unprecedented event in the academy history\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that Changyang Xiang Tian really at the 8th layer? Even a person at the peak of the 10th layer wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to beat a Saint who wasn\u2019t using his Saint Weapon\u2026\u201d\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian\u2019s strength can\u2019t possibly be only at the 8th Saint Force layer. Who knows, he might have already condensed a Saint Weapon. Otherwise, how else would he be able to beat a student like Senior Ka Di Yun, a Saint\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps Changyang Xiang Tian used some sort of despicable method to win\u2026\u201dJian Chen didn\u2019t bother to answer any of the comments and jumped down to where his older brother Changyang Hu was. Looking at his brother\u2019s expression of extreme shock, Jian Chen laughed, \u201cBig brother, I didn\u2019t dissapoint you. I\u2019ve won.\u201dChangyang Hu became emotional after hearing that, and hugged Jian Chen with both arms. \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re seriously amazing! You managed to beat Ka Di Yun, a Saint. Your big brother truly admires you!\u201d He said as he wrapped Jian Chen in a huge bear hug.Jian Chen let loose a happy smile from the affection, before he gradually disentangled himself from his brother\u2019s arms, \u201cBig brother, there\u2019s too many people here to talk. Let\u2019s leave this place first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24: SkillChangyang Hu unconsciously turned around to look at the crowd before nodding his head, \u201cAlright, fourth brother, let\u2019s go to your room first. You definitely have to tell me how you beat Ka Di Yun, and then later tonight, I\u2019ll grab a few friends to come and celebrate!\u201dJian Chen smiled happily at his brother, \u201cBig brother, I can teach you how I beat Ka Di Yun, but let\u2019s forget about the celebration.\u201d\u201cFine, I\u2019ll listen to you. Come on, fourth brother, let\u2019s go back to your dorm \u2013 it\u2019s far too noisy here.\u201d Changyang Hu started to pull his younger brother back towards the direction of the dorms.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian!\u201dBefore Jian Chen could take a step, a gentle and exquisite voice called out to him.Hearing the familiar voice, Jian Chen blanked out for a moment before turning around. Looking at the speaker, he recognized the figure of the running girl, particularly the pretty girl who had sat next to him in the library earlier.\u201cYes?\u201d Jian Chen questioned, as he indifferently looked at the young girl, who was so beautiful that it would be easy to cause a city to fight over her..The girl\u2019s voice was like a gentle stream of water as she laughed joyously. Slowly extending her arm out to reveal a purse, she happily said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you managed to win me 100 Purple coins, I really have to thank you.\u201d Her voice was extraordinarily soft, and also very pleasant to listen to; it was almost as if she was a skylark singing on a peaceful day..Hearing this, Changyang Hu appeared to have suddenly realized something. He slapped his forehead in disbelief, \u201cAi ya, I just remembered. I put down 100 Purple coins; that was my entire savings and I didn\u2019t get it back. Fourth brother, you go on without me, your big brother has to get his money back!\u201d And with that, Changyang Hu vanished like the wind, back to where the crowd of gamblers were.Looking at Changyang Hu rush back for his money, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but laugh. At that moment, the girl slowly walked up to Jian Chen, studying his handsome features with her inquisitive eyes. \u201cHello! Changyang Xiang Tian, my name is You Yue. May I ask you a question?\u201dJian Chen laughed and replied, \u201cMiss You Yue, if you have a question, you should go on ahead and ask, but I can\u2019t guarantee an answer.\u201d\u201cNo worries!\u201d You Yue gently laughed before asking, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, is your strength is really only of the 8th Saint Force Layer?\u201dJian Chen hesitated for a moment before he nodded his head, \u201cThat\u2019s right, at the moment, I am currently in the 8th Saint Force layer, but I have a feeling I\u2019ll be making a breakthrough into the 9th layer soon.\u201dYou Yue was surprised after hearing his answer. With an astounded look, she exclaimed, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you mean you really haven\u2019t reached the Saint level?\u201d Her voice carried some doubt; clearly, she didn\u2019t believe him entirely.Noticing the disbelief in her voice, Jian Chen furrowed his brows and spoke with some annoyance, \u201cMiss You Yue, I seem to have answered your question.\u201d Even though she was a beautiful girl that could cause countless cities to fight for her, to Jian Chen, she was no different than the average girl.You Yue immediately waved her hands in an apologetic motion as she laughed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Changyang Xiang Tian, I\u2019m just far too amazed. I hope you didn\u2019t take offense to what I said.\u201dHer voice trailed off as Changyang Hu came running back with a joyful face and a fat coin bag. When he arrived by Jian Chen\u2019s side, he was tossing the purse up and down his hand as he snickered, \u201cFourth brother, your big brother is very wise. In less than an hour, I\u2019ve won 100 Purple coins.\u201d 100 Purple coins was by no means a small number to a commoner and for those who only ate a simple amount of food in their lives; 100 Purple coins could feed a family of three for the rest of their lives.!Staring at the coin purse in his brother\u2019s hands, Jian Chen started to smile and said, \u201cMiss You Yue, if you have no other questions, then I\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201dYou Yue smiled back at him, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I won\u2019t hold you up any longer. I haven\u2019t finished reading my book either, so I\u2019ll be returning to the library. Changyang Xiang Tian, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201dSoon after, Jian Chen brought his older brother back to his dorm and closed the door as they both walked in. Immediately, Changyang Hu impatiently asked, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019ve got to tell me what you did to beat Ka Di Yun, and how strong you really are! It couldn\u2019t only be at the 8th Saint Force layer, you have to be a Saint!\u201d As he spoke, Changyang Hu\u2019s face revealed an impatient, excited face as he waited for an answer.Jian Chen gently shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not. Big brother, my actual strength should be not too far away from the 9th Saint Force layer. As for reaching the Saint level, I believe I\u2019m still quite far away from it.\u201dChangyang Hu looked at him with doubt, \u201cFourth brother, if you say you haven\u2019t reached the level of a Saint, then how did you beat Ka Di Yun?\u201dLaughing, Jian Chen replied, \u201cHaha, how did I beat Ka Di Yun? Big brother, did you not see the match clearly?\u201dChangyang Hu\u2019s head drooped down in embarrassment as he blushed, \u201cThat is\u2026er\u2026fourth brother\u2026actually, actually I wasn\u2019t able to see the match all that clearly. Could you please tell your older brother?\u201d Although Changyang Hu had seen the match from start to finish, there were some things that could not be comprehended by eyesight alone. For example, Changyang Hu had not been able to comprehend what happened when Jian Chen struck at Ka Di Yun with a punch that seemed to be as light as a feather, but still managed to significantly damage.Jian Chen sat on his bed, calmly looked at Changyang Hu, and said, \u201cBig brother, the only reason a student of the 8th layer like me was able to beat a Saint like Ka Di Yun was because I relied on a technique to win.\u201d\u201cA technique?\u201d Changyang Hu was still skeptical. He was no stranger when it came to techniques and skill, because in the academy, many of the teachers would often talk about their knowledge of their personal techniques. In a fight against equally matched experts, one would need to use extremely strong techniques in order to win, but such techniques weren\u2019t so easy to train in. Even if they did learn the techniques, only those with battle experience would be able to learn and perfect a technique to the point of being able to incorporate it into their fighting styles. What Changyang Hu really confused was that, not only was Jian Chen younger than him, but he has also only been at the academy for a few days now. Changyang Hu couldn\u2019t help but be shocked when he saw that Jian Chen had mastered such a technique.\u201cFourth brother, where did you learn a technique like that?\u201d Changyang Hu asked curiously.Jian Chen shook his head sadly, \u201cBig brother, I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201dUpon hearing that, Changyang Hu had a look of sorrow on his face. The next thing Jian Chen had said though, brought his spirits back up, \u201cBig brother, if you are willing to learn a martial technique, I can teach you.\u201d\u201cFor real? That\u2019s great! Fourth brother, when can you get started on teaching me? How about now?\u201d He was anxious to get started, and wanted to learn this amazing technique right away. Once he learned the technique, then it was even possible for him to challenge Saints who had condensed their Saint Weapons with his current power!Jian Chen laughed, \u201cBig brother, it would be better to start tomorrow. I\u2019ll be waiting for you in the eastern grotto outside the academy tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cAlright fourth brother, it\u2019s a deal! I\u2019ll be at the grotto tomorrow morning,\u201d Changyang Hu promised. Although many of the academy teachers could help instruct one on learning a martial technique, he knew in his heart that fighting techniques were best taught by the previous generation in a clan. Techniques taught by the professors here would not be strong enough to overwhelm any of his opponents.Afterwards, the two brothers chatted for a while, until Changyang Hu finally left. Because Jian Chen had used up most of his Saint Force to fight against Ka Di Yun, he was exhausted and slightly injured. Because of that, he decided to use the Class 3 Monster Core in order to recover his health.Little did he know that, the whole academy was already in an uproar about how Jian Chen had beaten Ka Di Yun. There wasn\u2019t anyone in the academy who hadn\u2019t heard about it, and it shocked both students and teachers alike. Everyone thought this to be inconceivable, and an event of this scale was practically unprecedented in the entire history of the Kargath Academy. No one had ever heard of a Saint, who had been strong enough to easily beat a person at the peak of the 10th layer be beaten by someone only at the 8th layer; even if a Saint did not use a Saint Weapon, he/she could still easily defeat someone of the 9th layer, let alone a freshman who was only at the 8th layer.The news of the fight between Jian Chen and Ka Di Yun soon reached the ears of the headmaster.Within the middle of the central tower in Kargath Academy, the headmaster pondered about the situation while standing next to the open window. As his eyebrows knit together, he asked, \u201cBai En, is what you say true? Changyang Xiang Tian actually beat the Saint Ka Di Yun while he was only at the 8th Saint Force layer?\u201d Even the headmaster couldn\u2019t believe it the first time, and his eyes twinkled in curiosity.The vice headmaster, Bai En, stood respectfully behind the headmaster. In response to the headmaster\u2019s words, Bai En replied, \u201cHeadmaster, I\u2019ve heard all of the students talk about it, but I\u2019m not too sure of the exact details. But right now, this event has set the academy upside down; practically every teacher knows that Changyang Xiang Tian has beaten the higher ranked Ka Di Yun. Rumors have it though, that Ka Di Yun didn\u2019t use his Saint Weapon, and fought bare handed against Jian Chen.\u201dThe headmaster stroked his long white beard, in deep thought. \u201cSince the rumors spread this wide, it would appear that it is true. Haha, it seems that Chang Bai has brought quite the complicated youngster. For a Saint to be beaten by an 8th later student, how inconceivable. Even if the Saint had recently broken through and didn\u2019t use his weapon, his strength should still be higher than one at the 10th layer. In all my years at Kargath Academy, I have never seen such a match where someone with a lower level won.\u201d\u201cHeadmaster, what should we do about this situation? Sooner or later, the seniors of the school will search for the 8th layer student who beat a Saint, and become an inconvenience for Changyang Xiang Tian,\u201d said Bai En with a respectful tone. The amount of respect Bai En had for headmaster couldn\u2019t be measured, as it could even be considered as worship.The headmaster turned towards Bai En and casually waved his hand, \u201cForget it, let them handle it by themselves. As long as they don\u2019t make a big deal out of it, we won\u2019t interfere. Besides, this should be a test for them; if they can\u2019t take everything thrown at them, then they won\u2019t mature into fine warriors.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: Instructing Big BrotherIn a blink of an eye, 3 days had past since the fight between Ka Di Yun and Jian Chen had taken place. Pretty much everyone in Kargath Academy knew about Changyang Xiang Tian now, you couldn\u2019t even walk a few steps without hearing his name.In the past 3 days, Jian Chen had spent every morning teaching his big brother martial techniques in the grottos. Other than that, he spent the rest of his time cultivating; the Class 3 Monster Core had drastically improved his cultivation rate. He wanted to hurry up and reach the 10th layer so that he could rush straight into the Saint level.Jian Chen had been very curious on how condensing a Saint Weapon worked, but according to book explanations, once the Saint Weapon is condensed, it replaced one\u2019s Saint Force. From that moment on, the Saint Weapon would be the origin for one\u2019s power. While it remains in the body, it releases Saint Force, and when one summons it, the Saint Weapon becomes one\u2019s strongest weapon. With it, one\u2019s attack would be multiplied.A Saint Weapon was one\u2019s energy; if it were to break, then that person would lose all of their cultivation progress as well as receiving a fatal injury. If the break was fatal enough, then the practitioner would die. However, a Saint Weapon was extremely strong, it wouldn\u2019t break unless the opposing side was vastly stronger than them.The next morning, Jian Chen opened his eyes signifying the completion of last night\u2019s cultivation. After 3 entire days of cultivation, the Saint Force inside Jian Chen had been strengthened and he estimated that he was long since past the 9th layer. He would have to test his Saint Force to find out whether or not he became a 10th layer practitioner or a Saint.Getting off his bed, Jian Chen got dressed quickly before heading out of his dorm. The sky was still dark, and majority of the students were still cultivating or sleeping. The sports field was relatively peaceful since there were no people in sight. Only in remote corners did Jian Chen see a few other early risers practicing.Passing the field, Jian Chen immediately headed towards the grotto. These past few days, Jian Chen was to spend some time every morning to teach his older brother some knowledge about the aspects of fighting. After all, in his previous world, Jian Chen was a wanderer and an expert for many years, so he had participated in countless battles. The amount of battle experience far surpassed that of the Kagarth Academy teachers. If actually compared, Jian Chen already had the qualifications to go teach the Kagarth Academy teachers.When Jian Chen arrived at the grotto, he discovered that his older brother Changyang Hu was already waiting there, and was currently sitting on a tree stump. He had an aimless expression, as he randomly swept his gaze around his surroundings in boredom. As soon as Jian Chen appeared, he immediately stood up in excitement, and jumped up from the tree stump. He happily said, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019ve finally arrived.\u201dJian Chen smiled, \u201cBig brother, why did you arrive so early?\u201d\u201cHehe, it\u2019s habit, just a habit. Fourth brother, let\u2019s start now. I spent the whole day yesterday trying to make heads or tails of the utilization of power you mentioned yesterday morning, but I was still unable to understand it. Can you re-explain it in detail to your big brother, one more time?\u201d Changyang Hu asked in a slightly embarrassed tone.\u201cOf course I can.\u201d Jian Chen smiled, and replied, \u201cBig brother, I\u2019ll tell you about that tomorrow morning. Today, I\u2019ll personally demonstrate it to you.\u201d Saying this, Jian Chen picked up a skinny stick next to his feet.\u201cBig brother, watch closely.\u201d Saying this, Jian Chen took the branch and lightly waved it in the direction of a small tree, about the thickness of his wrist. When the branch approached the small tree, the skinny branch directly left his hand and silently pierced through the small tree, as if there were no obstacles at all. It seemed almost as if the small tree was originally only a mirage.As he watched this strange scene, Changyang Hu started to have major doubts. At that moment, a rustling sound was heard, as the small tree started to split in the middle, the top half crashing down.Changyang Hu opened his eyes wide and immediately ran towards the tree only to see the strangely smooth incision on it. It was almost as if a sharp sword had chopped the tree down. It was truly unimaginable since this fine cut done by a light slash of a flimsy tree branch had been enough to chop through the small tree.Immediately, Changyang Hu\u2019s eyes switched over to the small tree branch in Jian Chen\u2019s hand. He ran on over and took it into his hands to look over, but not matter how much he looked at it, it seemed to be an average tree branch. As he brandished it softly, the tree branch merely swayed with his hand.Seeing this, Changyang Hu\u2019s doubt grew even more. He really did not understand how such a plain looking tree branch could cut down a tree trunk the size of his wrist. He exerting some strength into his fingers, and the tree branch in his hand broke in half.\u201cFourth Brother, how in the world did you do this? How can such a weak little tree branch cut down a small tree?\u201d Changyang Hu asked, the doubt on his face could be clearly seen.Jian Chen laughed, \u201cBig brother, this only requires Saint Force to accomplish it. Don\u2019t say its because of the tree branch; even if it\u2019s a needle or a sewing thread, they both can cut through a tree branch with ease. Of course, my current strength isn\u2019t strong enough to do that.\u201d\u201cWhat, a sewing needle and string can cut through a tree? Fourth brother, do you have a fever or something? This can\u2019t be possible.\u201d Changyang Hu cried out in shock. He couldn\u2019t believe what Jian Chen had said at all since he had never heard of such a thing since he was born; to him, this was an impossible feat.Jian Chen smiled from the start to finish of Changyang Hu\u2019s outburst; he had not expected him to react differently. But Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to explain; when the day came where Changyang Hu\u2019s strength was strong enough, he would understand.Jian Chen picked up another tree branch from the ground and said, \u201cBig brother, you\u2019re still wondering how I could use a tree branch to cut through a tree right? Take another look, I\u2019ll demonstrate one more time.\u201dChangyang Hu went silent as he became entirely focused on the tree branch in Jian Chen\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t dare to get distracted now, just in case he missed out on some details.Waving the tree branch in his hands, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed once before the tree branch suddenly distorted in his hands, causing the bent parts of the tree branch to slowly straighten. In the way it had been warped, it was almost as if it had a life of its own, since it was moving in the same manner as a snake would. It slowly started to move around in midair\u2013those who saw the sight would only be able to describe it as weird.Changyang Hu\u2019s eyes grew wide from this strange display as he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. With his eyes so wide, he looked as if he\u2019d seen a ghost. He couldn\u2019t believe it at all; it was only a tree branch, and yet it had unexpectedly started to move around by itself.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes started to emit an amazing light as he cried, \u201cBig brother, please watch carefully.\u201d Jian Chen grabbed onto the perfectly straight tree branch and walked forward with it towards another small tree nearby.His movements weren\u2019t fast at all; in actuality, they were very slow. Inching towards the tree, the moment his tree branch touched against the tree, it was as if the tree branch was being absorbed into the tree. Slowly, the tree branch went deeper and deeper into the tree trunk before it finally skewered itself through it.This act stunned Changyang Hu into silence as he focused onto the impaled tree trunk. His mouth dropped open so much that an egg could fit inside. His eyes were filled with an expression of disbelief.\u201cFourth brother, how did you do that?\u201d Changyang Hu shivered in awe. Even his heart was violently pulsing as his eyes were still planted on the tree.With a faint smile, Jian Chen answered, \u201cBig brother, it\u2019s actually not that hard to do this. As long as you harmonize your Saint Force with the tree branch, then even though it\u2019s just a normal tree branch, it will turn into a sharp weapon. If one\u2019s strength is strong enough, then the tree branch can cut as easily as an iron sword.\u201d\u201cTo harmonize the Saint Force and the tree branch\u2026\u201d Changyang Hu\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in concentration as he muttered. Immediately, he grabbed a tree branch on the floor and following Jian Chen\u2019s instructions, he began to infuse the tree branch slowly with his Saint Force.\u201cPeng!\u201dAt the very moment when his Saint Force made contact with the tree branch, the tree branch violently exploded and sent pieces of it flying throughout the air.\u201cBig brother, your Saint Force is excessively fierce, so the frail tree branch wasn\u2019t able to bear it. Also, you\u2019re not proficient enough to control your Saint Force to a fine level yet. Remember, when you harmonize the Saint Force into the tree branch, you must make sure to transform the Saint Force into a soft type of energy, not a violent one.\u201d Jian Chen instructed.Hearing that, Changyang Hu became puzzled, \u201cFourth brother, how does one make their Saint Force become a soft type of energy?\u201d\u201cTurning the Saint Force into a soft type of energy is merely just a different way of using it, that\u2019s all. Trying to explain this mystery anymore would be useless since only you can understand yourself. Big brother, starting from today, whenever you have spare time, try to harmonize the tree branch with your Saint Force. This way, it\u2019ll also strengthen your Saint Force. In the future if you can reach the level I showed you today, it\u2019ll bring you many good benefits when you cultivate.\u201d Jian Chen explained, almost as if he was a teacher instructing his students.However, Jian Chen knew that if Changyang Hu wanted to accomplish what he had just demonstrated, trying to make a frail tree branch strong enough to pierce through a small tree in such a small time, it would definitely not be accomplished in such a short amount of time. This required a high mastery of one\u2019s Saint Force, and without a sufficient amount of practice, Changyang Hu would definitely not be able to harmonize the two together. Having a wooden tree branch harden into a sharp weapon like an iron sword was not simple at all. Infusing an iron sword with Saint Force would be easier, for example, but while an iron sword could support a larger amount of Saint Force, a tree branch could not, and required a gentle control.Changyang Hu nodded, and after some contemplation, once again picked up the branch to try again. However, without exception, every single one of his attempts resulted in failure; not a single time did he succeed. He was completely unable to merge the Spirit Force into the tree branch. Every time his inner Spirit Force approached the tree branch, the branch would explode, unable to bear his overly fierce and intense Spirit Force.Jian Chen stood on a side and watched Changyang Hu practice, and at the same time, he continued to instruct his brother. They continued all the way until the sun had risen above them. Only then did Jian Chen leave the grotto, leaving Changyang Hu alone as he continued to try without stopping; next to him, the ground already had a huge pile of broken tree branches.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Concerned, he asked the pale youth that Jian Chen had kicked twice, \u201cLuo Yun, are you alright?\u201dThe student named Luo Yun nodded his head and spoke with a weak voice, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine after a few days of cultivation.\u201d Turning around, he asked the other injured student and whispered, \u201cKarl, you can find information around the academy faster than us; find out what that brat\u2019s name is then have Master Cheng sort him out!\u201dHearing his friend, Karl thought for a second before responding, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to, I think I already know who he is.\u201dThe other two student\u2019s face lit up as Luo Yun said, \u201cThat\u2019s great then, Karl, who is he?\u201d\u201cIn this years annual Freshmen Competition, there was an unusually strong competitor, the very same one that beat the Saint, Ka Di Yun, while being an 8th Saint Force layer practitioner. I think he\u2019s that person.\u201d Karl\u2019s face grew dark as he said it.As the two students heard Karl, their faces immediately changed. Looking at each other, Luo Yun said, \u201cCould he really be that Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201dKarl nodded his head, \u201cIt\u2019s very possible. Within the newest group of freshmen, only Changyang Xiang Tian could beat me. If he really is Changyang Xiang Tian, then we can\u2019t even be considered his opponents on any reasonable level if he can really beat that Saint, Ka Di Yun. Even if he didn\u2019t use his Saint Weapon, that\u2019s still enough proof of Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s strength.\u201d\u201cHmph, even if he really is Changyang Xiang Tian, he still dared to cross my path. I definitely won\u2019t let him have a peaceful time at this academy,\u201d spoke the first person who had been attacked by Jian Chen.Luo Yun\u2019s white face started to sneer as he growled, \u201cThat\u2019s good, our Luo clan\u2019s young master had been asking around for news about Changyang Xiang Tian recently. If he hears about this, the young master will be happy. It\u2019s a pity that we didn\u2019t know where he was for the past few days; after searching for him, who knew that he would coincidentally just show up here and now?\u201d\u201cLuo Yun, you go find the young master of your Luo Clan, Chen Feng and I will call out master Cheng. I doubt that Changyang Xiang Tian would be a match for master Cheng.\u201d Karl growled.\u201cFine, we\u2019ll all do what we need to, but I suggest that we leave one person behind to continue observing Changyang Xiang Tian. Since the academy is so large, if Changyang Xiang Tian decides to hide, we\u2019d never be able to find him,\u201d Luo Yun proposed.Karl nodded his head before turning to his friend behind him, \u201cChen Feng, you stay here and observe him; I\u2019ll go find master Cheng.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201d Chen Feng promised without hesitation.After the tasks had been split up, Chen Feng left to trail Jian Chen, while the two other students picked up the still unconscious one and left to do their own task.\u2026\u2026..Within the library, Jian Chen sat down at a nearby table with two books and began to eagerly read.Because the day was still early, the library was very empty and quiet. Aside from Jian Chen, there was only a middle aged female janitor nearby bustling around.The woman was around 40 years old with an average appearance. Since she had no talent in cultivation, she was only at the 6th Saint Force layer, even though she was already 40. Even the weakest student in Kargath Academy was stronger than her.The woman tilted her head up to look at the studying Jian Chen, and although she didn\u2019t know his name, Jian Chen had left a deep impression on her. Aside from the past 3 days, Jian Chen had always been the first student to enter the library, and was always studying for the whole day. There were even some days where he didn\u2019t eat lunch to continue reading. The janitor lady had already been serving the academy for many years, but Jian Chen had been the very first student she had ever seen that was so hardworking.\u201cWhat a hardworking child.\u201d She had muttered to herself as she set out to do her tasks.In a large room, a youth around 20 years old stood in the middle of the room with his eyes closed. His body was positioned in a very strange way, and like a log, he just stood there without moving a single inch.\u201cDong dong dong!\u201dAt that moment, a muffled knock was heard from the other side. At the same time, the youth with the closed eyes began to slowly open them and maintaining his strange posture, he stared at the door, \u201cWho is it!\u201d He called out.\u201cMy lord, it\u2019s me, Luo Yun.\u201d Came the voice from outside.\u201cEnter!\u201d He stated.The door opened, allowing the 20 year old man to see one of the four students that was beaten up by Jian Chen\u2013Luo Yun.Luo Yun looked at the weirdly positioned youth without batting an eye, as if this wasn\u2019t a strange occurrence. That was because this weird position was actually the Luo Clan\u2019s method of cultivation.In the Tian Yuan continent, there weren\u2019t many training manuals recorded. Among the few of them were cultivation meditation, and even less people had mastered a new position to cultivate in. The Luo Clan was definitely the latter and would put their bodies into a position unique to them in order to maximize their cultivation.Luo Yun walked over to the other youth and stooped over in respect, \u201cMaster, for the past few days you\u2019ve been searching for the whereabouts for Changyang Xiang Tian; I\u2019ve just recently found and met him.\u201d Although Luo Yun had a great standing within his clan, in front of this youth, even he would not dare to be arrogant. That was because this youth was Luo Jian, the first son of the clan leader of the Luo Clan. Along with the loving affection from the clan leader, he was deemed to be the future successor of the Luo Clan, and so Luo Yun had wanted to curry favor with him.\u201cYou\u2019ve found Changyang Xiang Tian!\u201d Upon hearing that, Luo Jian\u2019s eyes brightened up. Noticing Luo Yun\u2019s pale face, Luo Jian\u2019s eyes trailed down Luo Yun\u2019s shirt to see the single footprint on his chest. With a haughty voice, Luo Jian said, \u201cSeeing you in such a sorry state, it would appear that this Changyang Xiang Tian forced you to suffer quite a bit.\u201dLuo Yun\u2019s face grew angry as he spoke, \u201cWhat the lord says is correct; I just recently saw Changyang Xiang Tian and politely asked him to come visit my lord. But that Changyang Xiang Tian was completely outrageous and arrogant beyond belief. Not only that, but he is extremely violent, and most importantly, he did not care for you at all. He said\u2026he said that the lord\u2026the lord is\u2026\u201d Luo Yun started to trail off from hesitation.Luo Jian scowled, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there and stutter, what did Changyang Xiang Tian say about me?!\u201dLuo Yun\u2019s eyes flashed with an indignant color as he hesitated for one last time. With a spurt of courage, he cried, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian said that the master wasn\u2019t worth a fart, and throwing a shoe at him would not be worth the effort!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Luo Jian\u2019s face grew just as angry as his emotions. Although the Luo Clan was not extremely influential within the Tian Yuan continent, within the Gesun Kingdom, they were one of the most prestigious clans with a 200 year old history. In the Gesun Kingdom, the amount of clans that could beat them in power could be counted on one\u2019s hands. When it came to the successor of the Luo Clan, it can be said that Luo Jian was a noble of extremely high standards that even the crowned prince and princess of the kingdom could be considered to be on the same footing as he was. He didn\u2019t think that within the Kargath Academy there would be an unknown freshman that would dare to be so egotistical. In his entire life, he had never seen someone so arrogant towards him.Luo Jian\u2019s stare grew cold towards Luo Yun, \u201cHe really said this?\u201d The amount of anger was hardly being concealed by Luo Jian\u2019s tone.Seeing Luo Jian\u2019s reaction, Luo Yun was secretly delighted, however, he quickly regained himself and said, \u201cYes my lord, what Luo Yun says is true. I wouldn\u2019t dare lie to you; this Changyang Xiang Tian is truly too arrogant. He never saw you as anyone worthwhile, and even dared to spout out arrogant words. If we do not teach him a lesson, then I fear that the lord will lose face and be the target of ridicule within the academy.\u201dThe more Luo Yun spoke, the angrier Luo Jian became. Standing to his feet, he growled, \u201cWhere is Changyang Xiang Tian? I want you to bring me to him, and if he truly doesn\u2019t see me as someone worthwhile, than I shall see how strong he is.\u201d\u201cYes, of course! Please follow me my lord.\u201d Luo Yun exited the room and brought the angry Luo Jian out of the room with him towards the library.At the same time within one of the rooms in Kargath Academy, the respectul Karl brought another 20 year old youth out and towards the library.As they passed through the sports field, a few seniors noted the group with looks of surprise, their comments could be heard from all directions.\u201cAi\u2026isn\u2019t that person walking over there Lord Cheng? He hasn\u2019t been seen around the academy for over a year already, what wind blew him here today?\u201d A senior around the same age as him said in surprise.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that a year ago, Lord Cheng had already reached the middle levels of Sainthood, so there\u2019s no telling how strong he is now.\u201d\u201cLord Cheng is definitely the genius of Kargath Academy. He had condensed a Saint Weapon at the age of 19 and became a Saint. At the age of 20, he then reached the middle levels of Sainthood. One year has passed already, so the Lord Cheng must had reached the upper levels of Sainthood with his talent in cultivation.\u201d\u201cDefinitely, Lord Cheng is the number one genius at cultivation at Kargath Academy. The headmaster had even said before that by the age of 23, Lord Cheng would definitely become a Great Saint.\u201d\u201cBecoming a Great Saint by the age of 23, Lord Cheng is truly amazing. Many of the seniors in Kargath Academy are still at the rank of the 10th layer of Saint Force.\u201dAs Karl walked down the path slowly, the seniors the saw the pair walk by continued to gossip. Lord Cheng was a very well known figure within Kargath Academy, not for his character, but for his cultivation rate that would astound anyone. Within the Tian Yuan continent, he could be considered to be a prodigy blessed by the heavens, and in Kargath Academy, he could be considered as standing at the peak of the strongest experts.At this moment, Jian Chen was still pouring his interest into the book in his hands, completely unaware of the incoming trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28: Incoming Trouble (Two)In a flash, Luo Yun and Luo Jian arrived at the library gates. A few feet away from the big gates, the one who had been trailing Jian Chen, Chen Feng, was leaning against a tree trunk. His eyes were constantly watching Jian Chen, who was still reading with relish, and had completely forgotten about his surroundings.When Chen Feng saw Luo Yun with Luo Jian by his side, he immediately ran over to them. He bowed at Luo Jian, and with a charming face, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would meet the lord Luo Jian here. I am truly honored to see you.\u201d Chen Feng was extremely respectful; although he too belonged to a clan, within the Gesun Kingdom, it was a very minor one. It was only when he was joined together with the children of bigger clans that he dared to collect money from those weaker than him. With this, he had a strong relationship with the Luo Clan that would definitely bring him many benefits. If he was lucky, then his own clan would be pulled up into the higher ranks with the help of Luo Jian; after all, Luo Jian was to be the clan\u2019s successor.Luo Jian felt proud as he looked at the respectful Chen Feng, and gave a small wave of his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t say anymore crap, is Changyang Xiang Tian in the library?\u201dEven though Luo Jian had absolutely no trace of politeness, Chen Feng\u2019s look of respect didn\u2019t waver in the least. With a smile, he replied, \u201cHe is, Changyang Xiang Tian is still in the library.\u201dA sneer gradually formed on Luo Jian\u2019s face, as he got the answer he wanted, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Go inside and call him out for me.\u201d The library had a rule that all fighting inside was prohibited, and even Luo Jian had to respect that rule, despite his family having a great amount of influence.\u201cYes, of course, master Luo. I\u2019ll have Changyang Xiang Tian out immediately,\u201d Chen Feng said compliantly as he entered the library.Inside the library, Jian Chen\u2019s focus was still on his book; whenever he was in the library his guard was at its lowest. This was because within the library, he didn\u2019t have to worry about others causing trouble or asking questions, so remaining on guard wasn\u2019t needed.While Jian Chen was lost in his own world, he had the sudden feeling of someone\u2019s hand clasping down on his shoulder. Although he was still reluctant to part from his book, he looked to the youth standing next to me with a cold sneer on his face. From his memory, he remembered that this person was one of the four people who had tried to extort protection money from him.Chen Feng stood by his side with a look of great joy at Jian Chen\u2019s impending doom. With a strange tone, he said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d see each other again so soon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Jian Chen scowled. Without giving him face, he spoke, \u201cIf you\u2019re still looking for protection money, then you can scram.\u201dChen Feng\u2019s eyes flashed with anger, but he didn\u2019t dare make a move towards Jian Chen. The library was strict on their rules, and he was sure that he wasn\u2019t a match for Jian Chen.Chen Feng stuck his chest out as his glared maliciously at Jian Chen, and coldly said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, although I am no match for you, Kargath Academy is not someplace you can rampage around. If you really have the guts, then follow me outside. Otherwise, prepare to stay in this library for the rest of your life.\u201d After dropping these words, Chen Feng directly walked out of the library. However, the words he had said had already attracted the attentions of all the students within the library. Immediately, many people began to shift their attentions to Jian Chen with complicated expressions of envy, respect, and jealousy.Jian Chen slowly closed the book with a crossed expression. From Chen Feng\u2019s words it would seem that he got reinforcements to help him.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes twinkled as he put the book back on the bookshelf and then walked towards the entrance of the library deep in thought. Although he knew people were waiting outside for him, if he didn\u2019t go out then people would think he was afraid of them. If Jian Chen wanted to continue reading books in the library in peace, then he would need to reveal his own strength and inspire fear into the others. Otherwise more and more people would come and find trouble with him; there would be no point in coming to the library in that case.Although he knew that the people outside were definitely not weak, it was possible that they were experts at the same level as Ka Di Yun. However, Jian Chen still did not show any trace of fear. He was confident that if he faced a Saint at his current level, even if he didn\u2019t win, he would not easily lose. After all, no matter if it were battle experience or techniques, Jian Chen far surpassed anyone else at the academy. Moreover, he was a person who had experienced countless life or death situations.As soon as Jian Chen left the library, he looked up to find three youths standing outside the door. They didn\u2019t look very different from each other, as they all wore the school uniform. Two of the people were part of the extortion group Jian Chen had met before, and the third one was looking at Jian Chen with an expression full of arrogance. It was obvious that he had been a helper summoned by the other two.Seeing Jian Chen actually walk out of the library, Luo Yun began to laugh evilly. He whispered to Luo Jian standing next to him, \u201cMy lord, he is Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s arrogant eyes sized up Jian Chen with an expression of disdain, and he coldly said, \u201cBrat, are you Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201dJian Chen gave Luo Jian a level look. Luo Jian looked to be around 22-23 years old, and he had an extremely handsome appearance. However, his expression did not hide any of his arrogance.\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Jian Chen indifferently replied to Luo Jian, his tone ice-cold.Luo Yun, who was standing next to Luo Jian, shouted, \u201cHow dare you, Changyang Xiang Tian. What kind of status do you have to dare to use that kind of tone to talk to my clan\u2019s lord? Do you want to get kicked out of this academy?\u201d\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, hurry up and apologize to my lord. Otherwise, don\u2019t think you can stay at Kargath Academy for much long.\u201d Chen Feng did not miss the chance to suck up to Luo Jian, and yelled back at Jian Chen in an indignant tone.Hearing these two\u2019s words, the Luo Clan\u2019s lord, Luo Jian, became even haughtier, and his face was full of self-pride.Jian Chen\u2019s unchanged face gradually showed a hint of a sneer, and he looked at the three people with disdain, and said, \u201cBased on your words, are you saying that the headmaster of Kargath Academy will listen to you three? Or perhaps, are you saying that Kargath Academy belongs to your clan, whoever you want to leave must leave? The three of you are really too audacious, to even dare to look down on the headmaster.\u201dHearing Jian Chen\u2019s words, the expression of both Luo Yun and Chen Feng suddenly paled. Even Luo Jia, who had a huge clan backing him up, he could not stop his expression from turning unsightly, as he glared poisonously at Jian Chen. Although he had the most influence backing him up out of the three since Luo Jian was the successor of Gesun Kingdom\u2019s powerful Luo clan, he did not dare to show any disrespect towards the headmaster of Kargath Academy. If Jian Chen\u2019s words spread to the headmaster\u2019s ears, then they would be heavily punished. In the worst case scenario, they could be directly expelled. Even if Luo Jian had a powerful background, even if his father was Luo clan\u2019s clan leader, even if he was Luo clan\u2019s successor, there was no way he could get away of such a consequence completely cop-free. His Luo clan would definitely not be willing to offend Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster for his sake.Luo Jian\u2019s face turned gloomy, and he glared at Jian Chen, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you really are quite arrogant. I just wonder if you have the qualifications to be so arrogant.\u201dJian Chen laughed in disdain, and coldly replied, \u201cStop wasting your breath, just say why you\u2019ve come looking for me.\u201dLuo Jian let out a smile filled with a murderous intent. \u201cThe reason I came is very simple. I just wanted to see how someone like you defeated a recently advanced Saint, even if Ka Di Yun didn\u2019t use a Saint Weapon. Changyang Xiang Tian, are you really that amazing?\u201d Luo Jian cracked the knuckles on both his hands before clenching them both. The loud snapping sound from his knuckles was clear to hear as a strong amount of energy started to emit from his body onto Jian Chen\u2019s own.At the same time, the people who were reading their books inside the library all closed their books. Everyone start to chatter excitedly as they watched the events that were happening with Jian Chen with pleasure.Regarding the Qi that Luo Jian was emitting, Jian Chen was not affected at all and stood straight like a towering mountain. Luo Jian\u2019s strength was clear to Jian Chen and was not at all weaker to Ka Di Yun; however, it was not strong enough for him to fear, instead, his fighting spirit rose.As soon as they saw the two opponents were about to start fighting, the people in front of the library began to retreat, afraid that they would be affected by any shockwaves.\u201cHow could we miss such an interesting battle?\u201d Just before the two people were about to begin fighting, a voice suddenly rang out from the back, and a few youths wearing the school uniform walked out from behind.There were a total of five people that had just arrived. Among them, one of the people was another person from the extortion group that Jian Chen had encountered earlier. Jian Chen did not recognize the other four, but anyone could tell with a single glance that they were from major clans. Their brows seemed to hold an aloof and remote expressions.However, what drew Jian Chen\u2019s attention was the youth standing in the center of the group of five. It was obvious from his eyes that he was the core figure the other four revolved around. He didn\u2019t seem that old; based on his appearance, he was probably around 20 years old.\u201cYa\u2026.everyone, look; isn\u2019t the person in the middle master Cheng, who\u2019s been missing the past year? I didn\u2019t imagine that he would also come.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it really is master Cheng, our Kargath Academy\u2019s genius. It\u2019s said that a year ago, his power had already reached the middle Saint levels. With his talent in cultivation, I had thought during the past year, master Cheng had already broken through to the Great Saint level and graduated. I didn\u2019t think that he was actually still on the academy grounds.\u201d\u201cI wonder what master Cheng\u2019s current power is, and whether or not he has reached Great Saint level yet\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe three people next to master Cheng seem to be powerful Saints who have already condensed their Saint Weapons. To think that the elites that are normally rare to see would all appear here\u2026.\u201dSeeing the students standing there, all of the students started to shout in alarm, rapidly increasing the noise in the environment.\u201cCheng Mingxiang, you\u2019ve come at just the right time. If you were the slightest bit late, you would\u2019ve missed this interesting show.\u201d Seeing the youth amongst the crowd, Luo Jian immediately stopped his imposing manner, and laughed as he greeted the youth. He then nodded at the other three students following behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: Another Encounter With Tie TaCheng Mingxiang started to smile, \u201cHow could I miss a match like this?\u201d He stared down at Jian Chen with disdain before saying, \u201cDo you think that\u2019s Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201d\u201cCorrect, Lord Cheng. He\u2019s definitely that Changyang Xiang Tian who hurt our companions.\u201d Luo Jian said as he stood behind Karl.Cheng Mingxiang nodded his head and said slowly, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re definitely not bad, to even hurt my comrades!\u201d His voice was getting darker with each word.Jian Chen\u2019s mind already understood that these were a group of unreasonable children with rich parents, so arguing with them was of no use; they would only listen to force. Thus, Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to say any trash talk; instead, he said coldly, \u201cSo what if we fight; if you\u2019re not happy with this, make the first move instead of spouting so much bullsh*t.\u201dHearing Jian Chen\u2019s words, Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s face gradually turned ashen, \u201cGood. Good, good. Then it\u2019s time to see how strong you really are.\u201d With that, his body started to glow so brightly that the light extended 10 meters away to where Jian Chen was. Dashing forward, he launched his fist towards Jian Chen\u2019s nose; against a person who wasn\u2019t even a Saint, he wouldn\u2019t even bother using his Saint Weapon.Even Jian Chen knew that Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s strength far surpassed Ka Di Yun; the difference in Saint Force was far too great with his own as well. Therefore, Jian Chen absolutely could not afford to take that fist. Just when Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s fist was about to connect with Jian Chen\u2019s head, his head suddenly blurred and dodged the fist. At the same time, Jian Chen\u2019s two fists went up to grab at the incoming arm from Cheng Mingxiang. Assuming a horse stance, he stiffened his back and pulled at the arm with both of his own.Originally, when Cheng Mingxiang was attacking, his center of gravity had been leaning forwards. Now, Jian Chen had pulled him further, he momentarily lost control over his body, and he began to fall forwards. However, Cheng Mingxiang was quick to respond. Stamping on the ground with his foot, he exerted all his force to try to prevent any further pull from Jian Chen. As he did that, however, Jian Chen suddenly let go of Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s arm and immediately pummeled at his stomach with a barrage of blows that were as fast as lightning.Since Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s center of gravity was now focused towards the back, when Jian Chen had punched him with all his might, his legs couldn\u2019t help but stumbled backwards, as if he was struggling to avoid falling.After falling back 10 steps, Cheng Mingxiang finally regained his bearings but his face had long since turned into the same color as a pig\u2019s liver. With a dark and ominous expression, he glared at Jian Chen maliciously. Because of his majestic body, he was considered to have one of the strongest in the academy, so how could he not feel furious at this? If the academy found out his body was actually hit and injured like this, then he would no longer have face within the academy and become a laughing stock.After thinking about the consequences of this, he glared at Jian Chen with a stare that could kill since this was an utter disgrace to him.Already, the entire audience had became absolutely quiet. Luo Jian\u2019s own face had become sluggish as he stared at Jian Chen with a surprised look. This was far beyond his wildest imagination, and not just his own, but everyone else watching. Cheng Mingxiang was a talented genius when it came to cultivation, and even Saints couldn\u2019t match him in a hand to hand fight. To have Jian Chen make him suffer such a loss and put him in such an ugly state was very surprising.Glaring once more at Jian Chen, Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s arm started to release a silver type of Qi before forming a two handed sword. He snarled, saying, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I will definitely cripple you today!\u201d With that declaration, he surged towards Jian Chen with the silver sword in tow.\u201cStop!\u201dRight as Cheng Mingxiang had started to move, another deep voice had shouted over the crowd and noise. Immediately, everyone saw a rather robust and suntanned youth slowly walk forward.When Jian Chen saw the sturdy youth come forward, his eyes widened in shock. It was because this person was also a participant in the Freshmen Competition and the person with the heavenly blessed strength\u2013Tie Ta.The moment when Luo Jian and Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s men looked at Tie Ta, their faces started to change, an abject fear taking hold of them.Luo Yun didn\u2019t recognize Tie Ta at all, so with an arrogant cry towards Tie Ta, he demanded, \u201cWho are you? This is business concerning Lord Luo and Lord Cheng so don\u2019t interfere, otherwise you\u2019ll regret it\u2026\u201d\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Not even waiting for Luo Yun to finish talking, Luo Jian cut into Luo Yun\u2019s speech. Not even paying attention to Luo Yun\u2019s look of surprise, Luo Jian\u2019s face contained a smile towards Tie Ta as he cupped his hands in salute. \u201cSo it was brother Tie Ta after all, this one wonders what brother Tie Ta is doing here.\u201dTie Ta looked at him with an strange look before speaking in a low voice, \u201cWho are you? I don\u2019t recognize you at all.\u201d Not understanding why Luo Jian\u2019s face became so unsightly, Tie Ta directly walked towards Jian Chen and lifted his hand to clasp onto Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d meet you here of all places! It has been so many days since I last saw you!\u201d He boomed.Jian Chen also gave a faint laugh, \u201cTie Ta, let us put off this chat for now and let me take care of a few troublesome matters first.\u201dListening to what Jian Chen said, Tie Ta\u2019s head whipped over to Cheng Mingxiang and Luo Jian\u2019s group and slowly stared at them before pointing a finger, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, could it be that they\u2019re trying to bully you?\u201d\u201cIt could be said that way, yes, \u201c Jian Chen indifferently said as he crossed his arms in front of his chest.As soon as he heard this, Tie Ta immediately rolled up his sleeves. He fiercely looked at the opposing group of people and loudly declared, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian is my brother. Anyone who bullies him is bullying me as well. Whoever wants fight, come out. Even though my power might not be that strong, I, Tie Ta, am not afraid of you guys.\u201dHearing Tie Ta\u2019s words, Jian Chen hesitated for a second. He looked at Tie Ta in confusion, not quite understand when he had become Tie Ta\u2019s brother.Cheng Mingxiang and Luo Jian\u2019s expressions changed. They glanced at each other with a serious look. It was obvious that they were somewhat afraid of Tie Ta. Even though Tie Ta\u2019s actual power wasn\u2019t very strong, and they could easily defeat him in a fight, Tie Ta had a formidable supporter that even the two of them were afraid to encounter. This was why they had never dared to touch Tie Ta at Kargath Academy.Neither of the people spoke, and Karl and Luo Yun had already realized from Luo Jian\u2019s attitude that Tie Ta\u2019s identity was not normal. Thus, they made the smart decision off not making a sound. At that moment, the atmosphere had become slightly strange.After quietly pondering for a while, Luo Jian was the first to break the silence, \u201cBrother Tie Ta, this is a problem between me and Changyang Xiang Tian; I hope you don\u2019t meddle with our affairs.\u201d Luo Jian\u2019s tone was extremely polite. He clearly understood that although Tie Ta was a commoner, his current status was without a doubt not any less powerful than his. It was even higher than his by a bit. Even if he was the successor to the Luo clan, his status was at most equivalent to Tie Ta\u2019sLuo Jian\u2019s words made all the spectators shocked. There were quite a few seniors amongst them that recognized both Luo Jian and Cheng Mingxiang, and they knew that although their individual statuses weren\u2019t that high, they both had great clans backing them up. And yet, at the moment, the two of them had suddenly acted polite to Tie Ta. This made the library\u2019s spectators curious about Tie Ta\u2019s identity. They couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of background Tie Ta must have to have been so domineering, and to make the insufferably arrogant Luo Jian and Cheng Mingxiang so cautious and fearful.Unfortunately, Tie Ta had no intention to appreciate the offer. Without giving face, he said, \u201cI already said earlier, Changyang Xiang Tian is my brother. His problems are my problems. If anyone has complaints, then everyone should direct them towards me.\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s expression changed colors, and his eyes showed a serious expression. In regards to Tie Ta, he really didn\u2019t dare to offend him too much.At that moment, Cheng Mingxiang snorted, and he glared at Tie Ta. In a heavy voice, he said, \u201cTie Ta, do you really want to butt into this business?\u201d Having suffered from Jian Chen\u2019s hands, Cheng Mingxiang had already formed a hatred for Jian Chen in his heart. For a freshman that hadn\u2019t even reached Saint level yet to have put him in such a difficult situation was definitely a humiliation to his genius. If he didn\u2019t clean this situation up now, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy his time at the academy in the future.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I want to get involved.\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s yelled back, his expression harsh. Even though he clearly knew how powerful Cheng Mingxiang was, Tie Ta still did not show any sign of fear.Jian Chen pulled at Tie Ta and said, \u201cTie Ta, this is something between me and him. You shouldn\u2019t come **; otherwise, you\u2019ll just get caught up in more trouble.\u201dTie Ta\u2019s eyes flashed with anger, and he suddenly turned towards Jian Chen, frowning, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, what kind of words are those? Do you think that I, Tie Ta, is someone who would be scared of these things? Do you not think of me as your friend?\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen could not help but feel puzzled. When had he and Tie Ta gotten so close? They barely even met each other; the only time they had really interacted was during the freshmen martial arts competition.\u201cHmph, Tie Ta. since you want to suffer so badly, then don\u2019t blame me. Don\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re the headmaster\u2019s apprentice, I won\u2019t dare to attack you. Let me witness exactly how great the headmaster\u2019s apprentice\u2019s abilities are.\u201dHearing Cheng Ming Yan\u2019s words, Jian Chen was internally shocked. He hadn\u2019t imagined that Tie Ta had actually become the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. If this news was spread throughout the academy, it would spur a great craze.At this moment, Cheng Ming Yang had already appeared in front of Tie Ta, and directly struck his fist against Tie Ta\u2019s chest. Because Tie Ta had a special status, Cheng Mingxiang did not dare to actually hurt Tie Ta, and his fist only used fifth layer force. In his opinion, even if he only used the strength of the fifth layer, it still wasn\u2019t an attack that a Saint could receive, let alone someone below that, like Tie Ta.Faced with Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s attack, Tie Ta did not dare to be careless, and his face showed matchless concentration. He roared, then with his right arm seemingly as sturdy as steel, he fearlessly threw a fist at Cheng Mingxiang to meet force with force.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s definitely that Changyang Xiang Tian who hurt our companions.\u201d Luo Jian said as he stood behind Karl.Cheng Ming Xiang nodded his head and said slowly, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re definitely not bad, to even hurt my comrades!\u201d His voice was getting darker with each word.Jian Chen\u2019s mind already understood that these were a group of unreasonable children with rich parents, so arguing with them was of no use; they would only listen to force. Thus, Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to say any trash talk; instead, he said coldly, \u201cSo what if we fight; if you\u2019re not happy with this, make the first move instead of spouting so much bullshit.\u201dHearing Jian Chen\u2019s words, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s face gradually turned ashen, \u201cGood. Good, good. Then it\u2019s time to see how strong you really are.\u201d With that, his body started to glow so brightly that the light extended 10 meters away to where Jian Chen was. Dashing forward, he launched his fist towards Jian Chen\u2019s nose; against a person who wasn\u2019t even a Saint, he wouldn\u2019t even bother using his Saint Weapon.Even Jian Chen knew that Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s strength far surpassed Ka Di Yun; the difference in Saint Force was far too great with his own as well. Therefore, Jian Chen absolutely could not afford to take that fist. Just when Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s fist was about to connect with Jian Chen\u2019s head, his head suddenly blurred and dodged the fist. At the same time, Jian Chen\u2019s two fists went up to grab at the incoming arm from Cheng Ming Xiang. Assuming a horse stance, he stiffened his back and pulled at the arm with both of his own.Originally, when Cheng Ming Xiang was attacking, his center of gravity had been leaning forwards. Now, Jian Chen had pulled him further, he momentarily lost control over his body, and he began to fall forwards. However, Cheng Ming Xiang was quick to respond. Stamping on the ground with his foot, he exerted all his force to try to prevent any further pull from Jian Chen. As he did that, however, Jian Chen suddenly let go of Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s arm and immediately pummeled at his stomach with a barrage of blows that were as fast as lightning.Since Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s center of gravity was now focused towards the back, when Jian Chen had punched him with all his might, his legs couldn\u2019t help but stumbled backwards, as if he was struggling to avoid falling.After falling back 10 steps, Cheng Ming Xiang finally regained his bearings but his face had long since turned into the same color as a pig\u2019s liver. With a dark and ominous expression, he glared at Jian Chen maliciously. Because of his majestic body, he was considered to have one of the strongest in the academy, so how could he not feel furious at this? If the academy found out his body was actually hit and injured like this, then he would no longer have face within the academy and become a laughing stock.After thinking about the consequences of this, he glared at Jian Chen with a stare that could kill since this was an utter disgrace to him.Already, the entire audience had became absolutely quiet. Luo Jian\u2019s own face had become sluggish as he stared at Jian Chen with a surprised look. This was far beyond his wildest imagination, and not just his own, but everyone else watching. Cheng Ming Xiang was a talented genius when it came to cultivation, and even Saints couldn\u2019t match him in a hand to hand fight. To have Jian Chen make him suffer such a loss and put him in such an ugly state was very surprising.Glaring once more at Jian Chen, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s arm started to release a silver type of Qi before forming a two handed sword. He snarled, saying, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I will definitely cripple you today!\u201d With that declaration, he surged towards Jian Chen with the silver sword in tow.\u201cStop!\u201dRight as Cheng Ming Xiang had started to move, another deep voice had shouted over the crowd and noise. Immediately, everyone saw a rather robust and suntanned youth slowly walk forward.When Jian Chen saw the sturdy youth come forward, his eyes widened in shock. It was because this person was also a participant in the Freshmen Competition and the person with the heavenly blessed strength\u2013Tie Ta.The moment when Luo Jian and Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s men looked at Tie Ta, their faces started to change, an abject fear taking hold of them.Luo Yun didn\u2019t recognize Tie Ta at all, so with an arrogant cry towards Tie Ta, he demanded, \u201cWho are you? This is business concerning Lord Luo and Lord Cheng so don\u2019t interfere, otherwise you\u2019ll regret it\u2026\u201d\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Not even waiting for Luo Yun to finish talking, Luo Jian cut into Luo Yun\u2019s speech. Not even paying attention to Luo Yun\u2019s look of surprise, Luo Jian\u2019s face contained a smile towards Tie Ta as he cupped his hands in salute. \u201cSo it was brother Tie Ta after all, this one wonders what brother Tie Ta is doing here.\u201dTie Ta looked at him with an strange look before speaking in a low voice, \u201cWho are you? I don\u2019t recognize you at all.\u201d Not understanding why Luo Jian\u2019s face became so unsightly, Tie Ta directly walked towards Jian Chen and lifted his hand to clasp onto Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d meet you here of all places! It has been so many days since I last saw you!\u201d He boomed.Jian Chen also gave a faint laugh, \u201cTie Ta, let us put off this chat for now and let me take care of a few troublesome matters first.\u201dListening to what Jian Chen said, Tie Ta\u2019s head whipped over to Cheng Ming Xiang and Luo Jian\u2019s group and slowly stared at them before pointing a finger, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, could it be that they\u2019re trying to bully you?\u201d\u201cIt could be said that way, yes, \u201c Jian Chen indifferently said as he crossed his arms in front of his chest.As soon as he heard this, Tie Ta immediately rolled up his sleeves. He fiercely looked at the opposing group of people and loudly declared, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian is my brother. Anyone who bullies him is bullying me as well. Whoever wants fight, come out. Even though my power might not be that strong, I, Tie Ta, am not afraid of you guys.\u201dHearing Tie Ta\u2019s words, Jian Chen hesitated for a second. He looked at Tie Ta in confusion, not quite understand when he had become Tie Ta\u2019s brother.Cheng Ming Xiang and Luo Jian\u2019s expressions changed. They glanced at each other with a serious look. It was obvious that they were somewhat afraid of Tie Ta. Even though Tie Ta\u2019s actual power wasn\u2019t very strong, and they could easily defeat him in a fight, Tie Ta had a formidable supporter that even the two of them were afraid to encounter. This was why they had never dared to touch Tie Ta at Kargath Academy.Neither of the people spoke, and Karl and Luo Yun had already realized from Luo Jian\u2019s attitude that Tie Ta\u2019s identity was not normal. Thus, they made the smart decision off not making a sound. At that moment, the atmosphere had become slightly strange.After quietly pondering for a while, Luo Jian was the first to break the silence, \u201cBrother Tie Ta, this is a problem between me and Changyang Xiang Tian; I hope you don\u2019t meddle with our affairs.\u201d Luo Jian\u2019s tone was extremely polite. He clearly understood that although Tie Ta was a commoner, his current status was without a doubt not any less powerful than his. It was even higher than his by a bit. Even if he was the successor to the Luo clan, his status was at most equivalent to Tie Ta\u2019sLuo Jian\u2019s words made all the spectators shocked. There were quite a few seniors amongst them that recognized both Luo Jian and Cheng Ming Xiang, and they knew that although their individual statuses weren\u2019t that high, they both had great clans backing them up. And yet, at the moment, the two of them had suddenly acted polite to Tie Ta. This made the library\u2019s spectators curious about Tie Ta\u2019s identity. They couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of background Tie Ta must have to have been so domineering, and to make the insufferably arrogant Luo Jian and Cheng Ming Xiang so cautious and fearful.Unfortunately, Tie Ta had no intention to appreciate the offer. Without giving face, he said, \u201cI already said earlier, Changyang Xiang Tian is my brother. His problems are my problems. If anyone has complaints, then everyone should direct them towards me.\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s expression changed colors, and his eyes showed a serious expression. In regards to Tie Ta, he really didn\u2019t dare to offend him too much.At that moment, Cheng Ming Xiang snorted, and he glared at Tie Ta. In a heavy voice, he said, \u201cTie Ta, do you really want to butt into this business?\u201d Having suffered from Jian Chen\u2019s hands, Cheng Ming Xiang had already formed a hatred for Jian Chen in his heart. For a freshman that hadn\u2019t even reached Saint level yet to have put him in such a difficult situation was definitely a humiliation to his genius. If he didn\u2019t clean this situation up now, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy his time at the academy in the future.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I want to get involved.\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s yelled back, his expression harsh. Even though he clearly knew how powerful Cheng Ming Xiang was, Tie Ta still did not show any sign of fear.Jian Chen pulled at Tie Ta and said, \u201cTie Ta, this is something between me and him. You shouldn\u2019t come **; otherwise, you\u2019ll just get caught up in more trouble.\u201dTie Ta\u2019s eyes flashed with anger, and he suddenly turned towards Jian Chen, frowning, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, what kind of words are those? Do you think that I, Tie Ta, is someone who would be scared of these things? Do you not think of me as your friend?\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen could not help but feel puzzled. When had he and Tie Ta gotten so close? They barely even met each other; the only time they had really interacted was during the freshmen martial arts competition.\u201cHmph, Tie Ta. since you want to suffer so badly, then don\u2019t blame me. Don\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re the headmaster\u2019s apprentice, I won\u2019t dare to attack you. Let me witness exactly how great the headmaster\u2019s apprentice\u2019s abilities are.\u201dHearing Cheng Ming Yan\u2019s words, Jian Chen was internally shocked. He hadn\u2019t imagined that Tie Ta had actually become the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. If this news was spread throughout the academy, it would spur a great craze.At this moment, Cheng Ming Yang had already appeared in front of Tie Ta, and directly struck his fist against Tie Ta\u2019s chest. Because Tie Ta had a special status, Cheng Ming Xiang did not dare to actually hurt Tie Ta, and his fist only used fifth layer force. In his opinion, even if he only used the strength of the fifth layer, it still wasn\u2019t an attack that a Saint could receive, let alone someone below that, like Tie Ta.Faced with Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s attack, Tie Ta did not dare to be careless, and his face showed matchless concentration. He roared, then with his right arm seemingly as sturdy as steel, he fearlessly threw a fist at Cheng Ming Xiang to meet force with force.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His gaze then shifted over to the still fighting Tie Ta and Cheng Mingxiang before he said in a low voice, \u201cAre you still not stopping?\u201d His voice boomed like thunder, as the two people were struck by the loud echo, causing them to temporarily go deaf.Tie Ta and Cheng Mingxiang immediately paused; the moment they saw the vice headmaster. Tie Ta suddenly smiled with no small amount of excitement. Cheng Mingxiang\u2019s face, on the other hand, changed into one full of fear.Tie Ta walked up to Jian Chen and slowly looked him over carefully. In a low voice, he whispered, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, are you hurt?\u201dJian Chen only shook his head before giving him a meaningful stare to stay silent.Tie Ta only laughed in response; although he had the heart and body of a tiger, he could understand the meaning behind Jian Chen\u2019s actions. Without saying anything more, he stood behind Jian Chen and remained silent as per his wishes. However, Tie Ta still continued to look carefully at Cheng Mingxiang and winked at him as if to provoke him. Clearly the fight he had just now wasn\u2019t enough for him to fully enjoy it.The vice headmaster, Bai En, shot a strong glance towards Luo Jian and Cheng Mingxiang, \u201cLuo Jian, you\u2019ve already broken the rules of the academy; you know your crime.\u201dLuo Jian lifted his head in aggravation, \u201cVice headmaster, giving pointers amongst students is very common. Changyang Xiang Tian and I were only doing that and not anything else. As for me breaking the academy rules, your student inquires of you, which rule did I break?\u201d.\u201cHmph, you still dare to quibble like this!\u201d Bai En growled, \u201cLuo Jian, what is the 66th rule for Kargath Academy?\u201dLuo Jian titled his head in thought before answering, \u201cThe 66th rule is that fighting in the library and the destruction of the library is prohibited.\u201dBai En continued to stare at him, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me blocking your Sword Qi, then I\u2019m afraid that the library gates would have been broken by you. Luo Jian, do you recognize your crime now?\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s face suddenly dropped after hearing that; what the vice headmaster said was correct. If the Sword Qi he had shot out was dodged by Jian Chen and continued onwards, then the library gates would had been broken beyond repair and might have also hurt the audience that was watching.Whether or not Jian Chen would had been able to dodge the Sword Qi, Luo Jian didn\u2019t dare to say. If he did voice out this scenario, then he was afraid of another charge being dropped on him. Because the school had clear cut rules, it said that students were free to give each other pointers, but if they were to intentionally hurt someone, then they would be severely punished. Besides, he had deliberately used his Sword Qi to injure someone who wasn\u2019t even a Saint yet, so the situation was even more complex. Although he had expected this type of end result, he had thought that he would be able to get away with more. But since the vice headmaster was here, the situation had developed into a way he hadn\u2019t expected. Right now, in Luo Jian\u2019s heart, he could only hope that the vice headmaster wouldn\u2019t give them too harsh of a punishment.\u201cLuo Jian has recognized his crimes.\u201d He said in direction of the vice headmaster, he didn\u2019t dare be arrogant.Bai En snorted once more to himself before saying, \u201cLuo Jian, you have already violated one of the rules of the academy, I therefore sentence you to the Contemplation Hall to reflect on your crimes for a month, do you have any objections?\u201dThe Contemplation Hall was where students who had violated the rules of the academy would go to. Although it had the word \u201cHall\u201d in its name, it was nothing more than a small stone house. It was smaller than a dorm room and could hold only one person within it. Once the door was closed, the person inside would be placed inside a pitch dark room. No matter how strong the outside light was, it would not be able to penetrate through the stone house. Aside from seeing nothing, no sound would be able to get across either, even if the strongest hail storm was happening, the person inside would not notice a thing.\u201cLuo Jian has understood with all of his heart, and has no objection.\u201d He said with a bow of his head. His tone was respectful, and no one would have thought that while he looked repentant, the poison in his heart was growing with his grievances against Jian Chen.The vice headmaster nodded his head, a jollier expression was returning to his face, \u201cYou may leave then and look for the Contemplation Hall yourself to reflect.\u201d Afterwards, Bai En turned his eyes towards the anxious Cheng Mingxiang. \u201cCheng Mingxiang, even with your strength, to think that you were bullying a freshmen, our Kargath Academy has lost face because of you.\u201dCheng Mingxiang expressionlessly said, \u201cVice headmaster\u2019s teachings are correct. Ming Xiang understands his wrongs, and will not repeat them ever again.\u201d\u201cCheng Mingxiang, I hope that you bear in mind, this is Kargath Academy, not your Hua Yun Sect. If you want to continue living within Kargath Academy, then you must learn to comply with the rules. Otherwise, even if you are the young lord of the Hua Yun Sect, you will be punished accordingly. I hope that there won\u2019t be a repeat of this event. You may leave.\u201d When it came to Cheng Mingxiang, the vice headmaster was somewhat afraid of the consequences and didn\u2019t dare to punish him anymore.Cheng Mingxiang did not utter another word, as he and his followers quietly left the place.Seeing the worst come to past, Luo Yun, Chen Feng, and Karl did not continue to stick around, and left dejectedly.Once the crowds had dispersed, the vice headmaster\u2019s gaze rested on Jian Chen, and he smiled, \u201cYou must be Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dJian Chen nodded, and in a tone that was neither overbearing nor servile, he replied, \u201cYes, I am him.\u201dThe vice headmaster properly sized Changyang Xiang Tian up, and his previously solemn expression disappeared. He smiled and said, \u201cHaving not yet achieved Saint level and yet still managed to force Luo Jian to summon his Saint Weapon; Changyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re quite good.\u201d\u201cVice headmaster, you\u2019re exaggerating too much. It was only due to a moment of fortune,\u201d Jian Chen plainly replied, his expression completely devoid of any arrogance.As his eyes gazed at Jian Chen\u2019s collected expression, vice headmaster, Bai En, nodded his head in praise, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tien, you need to properly cultivate, and aim to become Saint level as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cMany thanks to the vice headmaster\u2019s concern. I will definitely continue to cultivate diligently,\u201d Jian Chen smiled.Afterwards, Bei En\u2019s gaze returned to Tie Ta, \u201cTie Ta, although now that you\u2019re the headmaster\u2019s apprentice, your identity has changed, you must still remember that only by improving your own power by yourself will you really earn people\u2019s respect. Only that way can you support yourself in Tian Yuan continent. Do you you understand?\u201dTie Ta cleverly nodded, and replied in a muffled voice, \u201cTie Ta understands.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The vice headmaster nodded, and continued, \u201cAlthough you are at the peak of talents, and your future is boundless, you cannot, under any circumstance, become confident. You must always face everything in a calm and collected manner. You also cannot learn anything from those aristocratic families, since you are now the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. Your future training will be more arduous, and you will have to spend more time on cultivation. You definitely cannot waste the headmaster\u2019s painstaking efforts.\u201dAt these words, Tie Ta patted his chest and promised Bai En, \u201cVice headmaster, don\u2019t worry. I, Tie Ta, will definitely cultivate diligently. I will absolutely not make master lose face.\u201dThe vice headmaster smiled and nodded, leaving the room. Once he had left, Jian Chen and Tie Ta chatted for a bit longer, and after exchanging goodbyes, Jian Chen returned to the library to read his books.When Jian Chen returned to the library, the students originally watching from within the library all disappeared without a trace. Not long after, the two moving news had travelled around the entire Kargath Academy at an unbelievable rate.\u201cThe freshmen martial arts competition\u2019s second place, Tie Ta, actually became Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster\u2019s apprentice. Moreover, he had an intense fight with the cultivation genius, Cheng Mingxiang.\u201d\u201cThe freshmen martial arts competition\u2019s Freshman Ruler, Changyang Xiang Tian, used only his bare hands, and managed to force a middle Saint level, Luo Jian, to use his Saint Weapon in a battle. Finally, Luo Jian disturbed vice headmaster Bai En, and ended up being confined in the Contemplation Hall for a whole month as punishment.\u201dThese two pieces of news had already been spread to every corner of Kargath Academy in the short span of two hours time, shocking both teachers and students alike. At the same time, Tie Ta had become the most well-known celebrity in Kargath Academy. He was originally just a commoner, but now that his identity had gone through world-shaking changes, nobles that had originally looked down on him because of his background now looked at him with new expressions. From that day on, Tie Ta had also become the child that people with varying amounts of influence tried to rope into their families.Although Jian Chen\u2019s name had also spread around the academy, it had already completely been overtaken by the extreme radiance from Tie Ta\u2019s news. However, Jian Chen paid no mind to it.Despite this, there were still many female students that looked at Jian Chen with sparkling gazes of infatuation. Jian Chen\u2019s appearance was extremely handsome, and was definitely not any lower than any other male in Kargath Academy. Combined with his unique grandeur and his powerful abilities, he was definitely a lady killer. Thus, in Kargath Academy, Jian Chen had become the white prince in many of of the girls\u2019 hearts.Ever since the battle at the library, Jian Chen\u2019s days had been anything but calm. Every time he entered the school grounds, he would be swarmed by countless male students trying to come up with various excuses to fight him. Even when he went to the library to read, he would still be harassed by quite a few people, making it so that he couldn\u2019t even read peacefully. Up until now, Jian Chen had also acted and disciplined a few people because they had been condescending children from rich backgrounds. However, perhaps because Jian Chen was too forgiving in his discipline, his attempts had close to no deterring effects, and were pretty much completely overlooked. Finally, the helpless Jian Chen was forced to bring the books back to his dorm to read under the vice headmaster\u2019s permission. Aside from reading, Jian Chen spent almost all his spare time cultivating.The time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three months had already passed. It was morning, and the sun had just risen. Sitting cross-legged on his bed, Jian Chen gradually opened his eyes, and in that instant, a light flashed within his eyes.Jian Chen lowered his head and slowly spread out his palms. He saw that his hands were empty, as the Class 3 Monster Core he had been holding had already completely disappeared.Sensing the strong Saint Force flowing through his body in a manner similar to great rivers, Jian Chen finally smiled \u2014he had broken through to the 10th Saint Force layer.After three months of cultivation, he had already broken through to the 10th layer. He was only one step away from reaching the Saint level, and could break through at any moment. The Class 3 Monster Core from the freshmen martial arts competition had already been completely used up by him. Although it was said that Class 3 Monster Core contained large amounts of energy, the amount that Jian Chen needed for his cultivation was far greater than that of an average person\u2019s. After all, the abilities that he achieved through his cultivation were extremely terrifying. Thus, a Class 3 Monster Core that could allow an average person at the 8th layer reach a middle Saint level, could only help Jian Chen reach the peak of the 10th layer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I hope that there won\u2019t be a repeat of this event. You may leave.\u201d When it came to Cheng Ming Xiang, the vice headmaster was somewhat afraid of the consequences and didn\u2019t dare to punish him anymore.Cheng Ming Xiang did not utter another word, as he and his followers quietly left the place.Seeing the worst come to past, Luo Yun, Chen Feng, and Karl did not continue to stick around, and left dejectedly.Once the crowds had dispersed, the vice headmaster\u2019s gaze rested on Jian Chen, and he smiled, \u201cYou must be Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dJian Chen nodded, and in a tone that was neither overbearing nor servile, he replied, \u201cYes, I am him.\u201dThe vice headmaster properly sized Changyang Xiang Tian up, and his previously solemn expression disappeared. He smiled and said, \u201cHaving not yet achieved Saint level and yet still managed to force Luo Jian to summon his Saint Weapon; Changyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re quite good.\u201d\u201cVice headmaster, you\u2019re exaggerating too much. It was only due to a moment of fortune,\u201d Jian Chen plainly replied, his expression completely devoid of any arrogance.As his eyes gazed at Jian Chen\u2019s collected expression, vice headmaster, Bai En, nodded his head in praise, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tien, you need to properly cultivate, and aim to become Saint level as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cMany thanks to the vice headmaster\u2019s concern. I will definitely continue to cultivate diligently,\u201d Jian Chen smiled.Afterwards, Bei En\u2019s gaze returned to Tie Ta, \u201cTie Ta, although now that you\u2019re the headmaster\u2019s apprentice, your identity has changed, you must still remember that only by improving your own power by yourself will you really earn people\u2019s respect. Only that way can you support yourself in Tian Yuan continent. Do you you understand?\u201dTie Ta cleverly nodded, and replied in a muffled voice, \u201cTie Ta understands.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The vice headmaster nodded, and continued, \u201cAlthough you are at the peak of talents, and your future is boundless, you cannot, under any circumstance, become confident. You must always face everything in a calm and collected manner. You also cannot learn anything from those aristocratic families, since you are now the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. Your future training will be more arduous, and you will have to spend more time on cultivation. You definitely cannot waste the headmaster\u2019s painstaking efforts.\u201dAt these words, Tie Ta patted his chest and promised Bai En, \u201cVice headmaster, don\u2019t worry. I, Tie Ta, will definitely cultivate diligently. I will absolutely not make master lose face.\u201dThe vice headmaster smiled and nodded, leaving the room. Once he had left, Jian Chen and Tie Ta chatted for a bit longer, and after exchanging goodbyes, Jian Chen returned to the library to read his books.When Jian Chen returned to the library, the students originally watching from within the library all disappeared without a trace. Not long after, the two moving news had travelled around the entire Kargath Academy at an unbelievable rate.\u201cThe freshmen martial arts competition\u2019s second place, Tie Ta, actually became Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster\u2019s apprentice. Moreover, he had an intense fight with the cultivation genius, Cheng Ming Xiang.\u201d\u201cThe freshmen martial arts competition\u2019s Freshman Ruler, Changyang Xiang Tian, used only his bare hands, and managed to force a middle Saint level, Luo Jian, to use his Saint Weapon in a battle. Finally, Luo Jian disturbed vice headmaster Bai En, and ended up being confined in the Contemplation Hall for a whole month as punishment.\u201dThese two pieces of news had already been spread to every corner of Kargath Academy in the short span of two hours time, shocking both teachers and students alike. At the same time, Tie Ta had become the most well-known celebrity in Kargath Academy. He was originally just a commoner, but now that his identity had gone through world-shaking changes, nobles that had originally looked down on him because of his background now looked at him with new expressions. From that day on, Tie Ta had also become the child that people with varying amounts of influence tried to rope into their families.Although Jian Chen\u2019s name had also spread around the academy, it had already completely been overtaken by the extreme radiance from Tie Ta\u2019s news. However, Jian Chen paid no mind to it.Despite this, there were still many female students that looked at Jian Chen with sparkling gazes of infatuation. Jian Chen\u2019s appearance was extremely handsome, and was definitely not any lower than any other male in Kargath Academy. Combined with his unique grandeur and his powerful abilities, he was definitely a lady killer. Thus, in Kargath Academy, Jian Chen had become the white prince in many of of the girls\u2019 hearts.Ever since the battle at the library, Jian Chen\u2019s days had been anything but calm. Every time he entered the school grounds, he would be swarmed by countless male students trying to come up with various excuses to fight him. Even when he went to the library to read, he would still be harassed by quite a few people, making it so that he couldn\u2019t even read peacefully. Up until now, Jian Chen had also acted and disciplined a few people because they had been condescending children from rich backgrounds. However, perhaps because Jian Chen was too forgiving in his discipline, his attempts had close to no deterring effects, and were pretty much completely overlooked. Finally, the helpless Jian Chen was forced to bring the books back to his dorm to read under the vice headmaster\u2019s permission. Aside from reading, Jian Chen spent almost all his spare time cultivating.The time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three months had already passed. It was morning, and the sun had just risen. Sitting cross-legged on his bed, Jian Chen gradually opened his eyes, and in that instant, a light flashed within his eyes.Jian Chen lowered his head and slowly spread out his palms. He saw that his hands were empty, as the Class 3 Monster Core he had been holding had already completely disappeared.Sensing the strong Saint Force flowing through his body in a manner similar to great rivers, Jian Chen finally smiled \u2014he had broken through to the 10th Saint Force layer.After three months of cultivation, he had already broken through to the 10th layer. He was only one step away from reaching the Saint level, and could break through at any moment. The Class 3 Monster Core from the freshmen martial arts competition had already been completely used up by him. Although it was said that Class 3 Monster Core contained large amounts of energy, the amount that Jian Chen needed for his cultivation was far greater than that of an average person\u2019s. After all, the abilities that he achieved through his cultivation were extremely terrifying. Thus, a Class 3 Monster Core that could allow an average person at the 8th layer reach a middle Saint level, could only help Jian Chen reach the peak of the 10th layer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun had been out for a while, so Jian Chen knew that it was no longer early in the morning.Today was a special day for Kargath Academy since this was when they would hold a large scale event where all the students and teachers would take part in. This event was called the Wilderness Survival. Every student would have to leave Kargath Academy to live in the forest 20 miles away for 3 days. Within the 3 days, every student had to have at least 2 Class 1 Monster Cores. For those who reached the Saint level, then they would need 2 Class 2 Monster Cores. The amount of Monster Cores wasn\u2019t limited, but whoever got the most Monster Cores would be gifted with a rich reward\u2013an earth attribute Class 4 Monster core as well as a Space Ring.The reward was so tempting, that if put under the nose of the children from rich backgrounds, even they would become emotionally moved from it.At the same time, any student that had reached this standard could also access the books about various battle skills and cultivation methods on the library\u2019s fourth level. This reward was especially enticing to those from average commoner families.Battle skills were techniques that could create strong attacks. Along with the distinct uses of Saint Force, it could boost one\u2019s power to 120%, making them techniques that would completely surpassed one\u2019s original abilities.On the other hand, cultivation methods could only be used when one reached the Saint level. Some commoner families didn\u2019t even know the lowest level cultivation methods and so children born in these families have to rely on the superficial breathing method given to them to cultivate Saint Force. These breathing methods were circulated around the entire Tian Yuan continent. Their steps were extremely simple, so most commoner families knew everything about these methods. The only downside was that these breathing methods could only help them cultivate to the 10th Saint Force layer, and were completely useless to people who had already reached Saint level. Thus, battle skills and cultivation methods were seen as unattainable treasures to commoners.On Tian Yuan continent, all the battle skills and cultivation methods were divided into four levels: Human Tier, Earth Tier, Heaven Tier and Saint Tier. Every Tier were then split into 3 separate levels: Primary, Middle and Advanced.After leaving the dorms, Jian Chen headed straight for the sports field. The event had already been announced three days ago and by now, almost all the students had finished their preparations for it by sharpening themselves to the peak of their abilities.By the time Jian Chen had arrived at the sports field, the place was already swarming with people. However, it was still obvious to see that the people were split into two groups; one of the groups was a gathering of all the nobles and the other group was entirely made up of commoners who did not have any major backgrounds.All the students that had not yet reached Saint level were holding a steel weapon that were glistering under the sun. Since they were facing beasts, the school administration had allowed them to choose their own weapons.Jian Chen walked over to the weapons rack. However, when he saw all the weapons there, his brows could not help but knit together. The good weapons had pretty much all been chosen by the students already and the only ones remaining that were of decent quality were the heavy type weapons that required a lot of strength to use; they were not at all compatible with Jian Chen.Jian Chen swept a glance over the entire weapons rack. When he noticed a fractured iron rod that was about the thickness of his finger, his eyes suddenly lit up. He exerted all his strength to pull it out, only to discover that the iron rod was about three inches long and its surface was already completely covered in dark yellow rust marks. One of the ends had an extremely sharp point.Jian Chen weighed the rusted iron rod in his hands and then tested its sturdiness, before nodding in satisfaction. This iron rod seemed somewhat unsuitable at a glance, but its heaviness and length were compatible with Jian Chen and amongst the remaining weapons, only this iron rod would be able to bring out most of Jian Chen\u2019s abilities.At this moment, Tie Ta walked out from the crowd. On his back was an enormous axe that was practically as large as him. It made Tie Ta seem even more impressive and powerful.Tie Ta walked up to Jian Chen and his gaze rested on the stained iron rod in Jian Chen\u2019s hands. His eyes could not help but show confusion as he asked, \u201cHai, Changyang Xiang Tian, what are you doing with an iron rod?\u201dJian Chen laughed, \u201cWhat else could I do with it, of course its to be used as a weapon.\u201d\u201cNo way, Changyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re actually using this lousy iron rod as a weapon? You\u2026.you\u2026.is your brain ok?\u201d Tie Ta asked in shock.Jian Chen chuckled and did not explain any further.Although Tie Ta could not understand why Jian Chen would use such a lousy iron rod as a weapon, he did not continue to pursue this question. Instead, he said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, how about the two of us team-up? If we join hands, then none of the Class 1 magical beasts can obstruct us. We would even be able to overwhelm a Class 2 magical beast. Moreover, I\u2019ve been hunting wild beasts in these types of forests since I was young, and I\u2019ve gradually learned quite a bit of experience about surviving in the wild. If you\u2019re together with me, I promise that you won\u2019t have any hardships.\u201dJian Chen considered it for a while. Finally, he nodded his head in agreement at Tie Ta\u2019s offer. The school did not prohibit students from forming groups of 3-5 people to kill the magical beasts, so many students ended up moving together as small groups.At that moment, a handsome noble carrying an arrogant air walked up to Tie Ta and smiled, \u201cHello Tie Ta, my name is Xiu Mi Si. I\u2019m at the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer. Do you want to become partners with me? I believe that if we join hands, hunting magical beasts will be much easier for us both.\u201dTie Ta glanced at Xiu Mi Si and shook his head, \u201cNo need, Changyang Xiang Tian and I together are enough. We don\u2019t need anymore people to join.\u201dFaced with Tie Ta\u2019s rejection, Xiu Mi Si did not show any despair. He turned to look at Jian Chen, and his face immediately turned haughty, \u201cThis person must be Changyang Xiang Tian, the fourth lord from Lore City\u2019s Changyang clan. My father is the leader of the Xiu Mi clan in Forbidden City. Does junior Changyang Xiang Tian welcome me into your group?\u201d Although Xiu Mi Si\u2019s words were still in a relatively respectful tone, his words hid a threatening force behind them.Forbidden City was a King City, and when it came to the Gesun Kingdom, Forbidden City was considered to be an Imperial City because the Imperial Palace was situated in Forbidden City.Hearing the forcefulness behind Xiu Mi Si\u2019s words, Jian Chen knit his brows. He swept his gaze over Xiu Mi Si\u2019s handsome face, and coldly replied, \u201cI apologize, but we no longer need any additional people. After all, we\u2019re only facing Class 1 magical beasts, so we don\u2019t have the time to spare babysitting others.\u201dHearing this, Xiu Mi Si immediately turned the color of pig liver. His face darkened at Jian Chen\u2019s meaning, and it was obvious that Jian Chen was looking down on Xiu Mi Si\u2019s abilities.Xiu Mi Si\u2019s face grew stormy, and he maliciously glared at Jian Chen\u2019s indifferent expression, before coldly snorting and walking away.After Xiu Mi Si left, quite a few people from complex backgrounds approached. These people did not want to greet Tie Ta, but only wanted to join his group. However, all of them were rejected. Tie Ta had no feelings for any of this people, and he was unwilling to interact much with them.After everyone had left, a youth around 20 years old, with a tall and sturdy stature, not very different from Tie Ta\u2019s, walked over from the distance. He walked straight towards Jian Chen, and reached his hand out to strongly pat Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder and laughed, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019ve become the school\u2019s celebrity now. Amongst all of Kargath Academy\u2019s students, I\u2019m sure that at this point, there is nobody that doesn\u2019t know of your reputation. Not bad, not bad. You haven\u2019t lost Changyang clan\u2019s face, and your older brother has been able to draw on some of your spotlight too.\u201d The sturdy youth was Jian Chen\u2019s older brother, Changyang Hu. He was currently sporting an extremely happy expression, and it was clear that his excitement was genuine.Jian Chen smiled, \u201cBig brother, stop joking around. Oh right, you\u2019ve come at a perfect time. Why don\u2019t we join groups for this event?\u201dChangyang Hu shook his head as he seemed to have thought of something. He happily replied, \u201cFourth brother, if you had asked me a week ago, perhaps your older brother would have agreed to form a group with you. However, I can\u2019t right now, because a week ago, your brother finally broke through to the Saint level, thus becoming a Saint. This means that during today\u2019s event, I will be entering the third layer to kill Class 2 magical beasts, so I can\u2019t be together with you.\u201d While saying this, a powerful Saint Force was emitted from Changyang Hu\u2019s body, his hands glowing with a yellow light, forming a large, double-edged battleaxe. The battleaxe was about as large as a washbasin, and gave off a yellow glow.\u201cFourth brother, not bad, right? After I broke through to Saint level, I was shocked to discover that I actually have the earth attribute,\u201d Changyang Hu said proudly. Saints that had attributes normally had huge advantages when fighting Saints without attributes. If the two had the exact same levels of strength and fought each other, under normal circumstances, the Saint with attributes would ultimately be the victor.A person could only discover if their Saint Force had attributes after breaking through to the Saint level. Thus, anyone that had not yet become a Saint were not able to detect if their Saint Force had attributes or not. However, the chances of having an attributed Saint Force were extremely low. On average, 1 out of 1000 Saints could use attributes in their Saint Force.In addition, pretty much all of the ones gathered in Kargath Academy were the ones that had the highest potential in all of Gesun Kingdom. That\u2019s why it was perfectly normal for many Saints to have attributed Saint Force amongst a group of a thousand students.Seeing the double-edged battleaxe in Changyang Hu\u2019s hands, Jian Chen could not help but happily smile, \u201cBig Brother, congratulations for successfully breaking through and becoming a Saint. You even have an attribute.\u201dChangyang Hu\u2019s expression was extremely happy, and he reached his hand to point at a few youths that were with him, \u201cThat\u2019s right, fourth brother, I must introduce these people to you. These are the relatively outstanding children directly under my command. Their names are Changyang Ao Jian, Changyang Feng, and Changyang Xiao Tian.\u201d\u201cWe greet the fourth master!\u201d The three youths simultaneously bent over in greeting, their attitudes extremely respectful. The hierarchy in the Changyang clan was extremely strict, so although they were the more outstanding members of the Changyang clan, their statuses were much lower than Jian Chen\u2019s. Even though they were all older than Jian Chen, they still had to treat Jian Chen with a respectful manner.Moreover, while saluting the younger Jian Chen, the three of them did not feel any traces of unfairness; on the contrary, they actually felt a sense of pride. After all, Jian Chen had managed to defeat the Saint, Ka Di Yun, when he was only at the 8th Saint Force layer, and had managed to fight to a standstill while bare-handed against Luo Jian. Finally, he had even forced Luo Jian to use his Saint Weapon. All of Jian Chen\u2019s achievements made the entire Kargath Academy sigh in admiration.In the presence of the other members of the Changyang Clan, they couldn\u2019t help but feel proud. Not just because Jian Chen was a member of their clan, but that because he was the fourth lord of the Changyang Clan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34: Casually Hunting For Monster CoresLooking at the detached head spin through the air as the body spasmed spraying blood, Tie Ta\u2019s face was full of alarm. At this moment they had easily killed a Class 1 Magical Beast, allowing himself to feel more confident about his strength. The cyan colored viper hadn\u2019t even made Tie Ta expend a great amount of his energy at all.Jian Chen slowly separated the body of the viper from the iron rod and wiped the blood onto the surrounding grass. It had actually been Jian Chen who contributed the most in killing the Class 1 Magical Beast; if it were not for his lightning quick thrust through the viper\u2019s body and dealing it a huge wound as it was pierced, then Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe would not have been able to sever the snake\u2019s head.Recollecting his battleaxe, Tie Ta\u2019s face looked at the detached head proudly while stepping on the viper\u2019s dead carcass. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this is a Class 1 Magical beast? How weak it was!\u201dJian Chen laughed as he heard Tie Ta, \u201cIt\u2019s not that the magical beasts are weak, it\u2019s because us two combined are too strong. Besides, this Class 1 Magical Beast wouldn\u2019t give much trouble for even a person who just recently broke through to becoming a Saint.\u201dTie Ta returned Jian Chen\u2019s smile and wiped his battleaxe dry from the blood. Bringing it to his shoulder, he let loose a laugh and said, \u201cIf you say that, then doesn\u2019t that mean we can casually walk around and kill Class 1 Magical Beasts?\u201dIt looked as if Jian Chen had came to a realization as his face revealed a joyful smile, \u201cNot bad, with our two strengths, even if we were to fight against a Class 1 Magical Beast by ourselves we would be able to kill it easily. But if we were to join together, then no magical beast in the 2nd region would be able to bring us trouble. The magical beasts here aren\u2019t strong because the academy had meant for them to be for students to help pick up battle experience. There won\u2019t be any strong magical beasts here, except\u2026\u201d He trailed off in thought.Jian Chen\u2019s silence caused Tie Ta to pause, \u201cExcept what\u2026\u201d\u201cUnless we come across a group of magical beasts. However, we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s here or not.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face was serious as he spoke. With his strength, Jian Chen would not find any problems if he came across a Class 1 Magical Beast, but if he came across a whole group of them, then there would be no way at all.Tie Ta wrinkled his eyebrows together and said uncertainly, \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be likely. I\u2019ve been in the forests many times and never saw a whole bunch of magical beasts together.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for sure we won\u2019t, I\u2019ve read up in the library on books pertaining to magical beasts. There are a few types of magical beasts that all live in a group together. Together, their power is strong and very rarely do they travel by themselves.\u201d Jian Chen walked over to where the decapitated snake head was and only then did he realized that the viper was only 6 to 7 meters long. Using the iron rod to cut 7 meters in, he took out the rod from the viper\u2019s body to reveal a bloody crystal.Within the Tian Yuan continent, there were many different types of monster cores, while their monster cores were not at all like each other. Some magical beasts had their monster core in the head, some in the pit of their stomachs, and some in their abdomen. The viper for example had its monster core within it\u2019s tail, but Jian Chen had already known that a long time ago.\u201cPeng!\u201d Tie Ta brought down the battle axe on his shoulder into a tree. It sunk into the tree as smoothly like water in a bucket before he cried out loudly, \u201cIf there really are magical beasts that are in a group, I Tie Ta will definitely kill them all!\u201dJian Chen held the monster core he got from the cyan viper and rubbed it clean of blood with the nearby grass. Throwing it to Tie Ta, he said, \u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need to yell. There\u2019s a lot of magical beasts that travel in herds in the Tian Yuan continent, but it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll meet up with one for sure. Nothing is for sure, after all, this is the magical beast forest.\u201dTie Ta snatched the monster core thrown at him and looked at Jian Chen weirdly, \u201cWhat are you doing giving this to me?\u201dJian Chen laughed, \u201cThe viper was slain by you, so this monster core is yours by rights.\u201d Seeing Tie Ta trying to find a way to find a reason against this, Jian Chen continued to say, \u201cThis monster core is yours, don\u2019t say otherwise. Just take it. After all we still have 3 more days, at our current rate we\u2019ll definitely be able to get a lot more, so I don\u2019t really care for this one monster core.\u201d\u201cHaha, okay then. I\u2019ll be taking this monster core. The next monster core will be yours no matter who kills it then.\u201d Holding the bloodstained monster core high up in the air, Tie Ta was extremely happy. Though that was for sure since this was the first monster core he had gotten after killing a Class 1 Magical Beast.Afterwards, the two of them continued on their way. Now that he knew that Jian Chen had an acute sense for detecting danger, Tie Ta had simply handed the patrolling duties to Jian Chen. On the other hand, he began to ceaselessly hack at the grass in front of them to clear their path. Although constantly waving the heavy battleaxe around expended a great amount of energy, it was as simple as eating a meal to Tie Ta, who had godly strength. To him, this action wasn\u2019t the slightest bit taxing; after all, his strength was great enough to frighten others, and he seemed to have infinite amounts of energy as well. Thus, it was impossible for him to become exhausted in a situation like this.Not long after the two had left, Jian Chen\u2019s ears twitched, and his footsteps came to an abrupt halt. He stretched his hand out towards Tie Ta, who was currently slashing at the grass in front of them, and gestured at him to be silent.Tie Ta intuitively understood the situation, and stopped his attempt at hacking through the weeds. Tightly gripping the battleaxe, he returned to Jian Chen\u2019s side, and stood shoulder to shoulder with him. Tie Ta\u2019s eyes flashed, as he inspected their surroundings with caution.Their breathing became very faint, as their expressions were filled with caution. The difference between the two was that Tie Ta was constantly looking around, while Jian Chen had gently closed his eyes in attempt to sense everything around them.It was currently extremely difficult to discern anything among the grass. Even if there really was an unknown danger lurking around, it would unfortunately not be something that one could use the naked eye to see. Thus, Tie Ta could not discover anything despite sweeping his gaze around all four corners for a long period of time.Jian Chen lightly closed his eyes, his keen ears twitching periodically as they tried to catch all noises coming from his surroundings. At the same time, his consciousness also reached new heights, and he used his powerful \u201cSoul\u201d to reach out and sense the world around him.At that moment, Jian Chen could not help but recall one of his fights against Dugu Qiubai. Eventually, just as he was about to die, his powers had suddenly broken through and reached the Realm of the Sword God. At that moment, his \u201csoul\u201d had became incomparably strong and could even manifest it outside his body into the surrounding air. Whenever he spread his \u201csoul\u201d out into an area, then there would be no way anyone or anything inside would be able to escape his perception.However, what made Jian Chen feel regret was that after entering this world, although his soul was extremely powerful, he could no longer extend it outwards. Otherwise, this dense forest would not give Jian Chen any difficulties at all. Searching for a hidden magical beast would be extremely easy.Jian Chen\u2019s soul densely concentrated together, and he exerted all his efforts to sense his surroundings. Slowly, his spirit entered a unique state; although he had not extended his soul, at that instant, his soul seemed to have established a subtle relationship with the various plants around him, fusing together. This feeling was extremely mysterious.However, as soon as Jian Chen entered this state, he senses immediately shot up to new levels. Finally, a barely discernable breathing sound entered his sensing range. The breath was so faint that even if one stood next to it, one most likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear it.In an instant, Jian Chen\u2019s opened his eyes, and in a flash, he had already disappeared from his original location, and was flying towards the side at high speeds. While moving, Jian Chen constantly twisted and adjusted his body to evade the branches obstructing his path.In an instant, Jian Chen had already crossed over a distance of 10 meters. He quickly thrusted out the iron rod in his hands at lightning fast speed, silently cutting away the surrounding leaves and weeds, the tip aimed towards the the black figure hiding within the grass.\u201cAo!\u201dA shriek of pain suddenly rang out, as a dark shadow jumped out from the grass, leaping towards Jian Chen with its ferocious mouth wide open.This was a black panther, around 2 meters long. Its head had an open wound where fresh blood was pouring out from. The blood flowed down through the black fur on its face, intensifying its fierce appearance.Jian Chen\u2019s gaze was as sharp as a sword as a sneer began to form on his face. He shook his arm, and once again lashed out with the iron rod in his hand at an unfathomable speed, his objective being the black panther\u2019s neck. Up until the end, the black panther had absolutely no time to react, as the iron rod\u2019s sharp point plunged deeply through its throat. In addition, since the black panther\u2019s body was currently lunging in the air, its heavy body quickly dropped downwards, pushing the iron rod deeper and deeper through its neck. Eventually, the point had drilled a hole directly through, and the end had come out of the other side.This time, the black panther didn\u2019t even have the time to cry out before it had already died. It fell to the ground with its eyes wide open, grief instilled in its gaze.At that moment, Tie Ta finally caught up from behind. When he looked over at the ground, he saw the corroded iron rod pierced through the black panther\u2019s throat. Immediately, his eyes widened in extreme shock.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this\u2026.this\u2026.did you kill this?\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s voice was trembling in shock. Even though he had witnessed the moment that Jian Chen\u2019s weapon had pierced through the black panther\u2019s throat, he still couldn\u2019t believe the scene no matter how hard he tried. That was because the period of time that had passed was way too short; when Jian Chen had charged over, Tie Ta had already followed behind at his fastest speed. However, by the time he had caught up, all he saw was the Class 1 Magical Beast dying by Jian Chen\u2019s hands. The amount of time that had passed was definitely not even long enough to take a breath, or even half a breath.Being able to kill a Class 1 Magical Beast in half a breath\u2019s time was natural for some professionals. However, Tie Ta clearly knew that Jian Chen\u2019s abilities had not yet reached Saint level. Moreover, the weapon he was using was a mere corroded iron rod.Jian Chen placed his foot on the black panther\u2019s head, and gradually pulled out the iron rod. As if nothing had happened, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I killed it. However, it was just a coincidence. Originally, there was no way it would\u2019ve died so quickly. However, it kept approaching my weapon, and in the end, its life was extinguished before it could even cry out in despair.\u201dHearing this, Tie Ta rubbed the back of his head, and doubtfully glanced at Jian Chen\u2019s indifferent face. In disbelief, he asked, \u201cIs that true? You\u2019re not lying to me?\u201dJian Chen laughed, \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. Why would I lie to you?\u201dSeeing Jian Chen\u2019s sincere expression, Tie Ta was beyond puzzled, and muttered, \u201cDo such stupid magical beasts really exist, to actually give itself up to a weapon?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this moment they had easily killed a Class 1 Magical Beast, allowing himself to feel more confident about his strength. The cyan colored viper hadn\u2019t even made Tie Ta expend a great amount of his energy at all.Jian Chen slowly separated the body of the viper from the iron rod and wiped the blood onto the surrounding grass. It had actually been Jian Chen who contributed the most in killing the Class 1 Magical Beast; if it were not for his lightning quick thrust through the viper\u2019s body and dealing it a huge wound as it was pierced, then Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe would not have been able to sever the snake\u2019s head.Recollecting his battleaxe, Tie Ta\u2019s face looked at the detached head proudly while stepping on the viper\u2019s dead carcass. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this is a Class 1 Magical beast? How weak it was!\u201dJian Chen laughed as he heard Tie Ta, \u201cIt\u2019s not that the magical beasts are weak, it\u2019s because us two combined are too strong. Besides, this Class 1 Magical Beast wouldn\u2019t give much trouble for even a person who just recently broke through to becoming a Saint.\u201dTie Ta returned Jian Chen\u2019s smile and wiped his battleaxe dry from the blood. Bringing it to his shoulder, he let loose a laugh and said, \u201cIf you say that, then doesn\u2019t that mean we can casually walk around and kill Class 1 Magical Beasts?\u201dIt looked as if Jian Chen had came to a realization as his face revealed a joyful smile, \u201cNot bad, with our two strengths, even if we were to fight against a Class 1 Magical Beast by ourselves we would be able to kill it easily. But if we were to join together, then no magical beast in the 2nd region would be able to bring us trouble. The magical beasts here aren\u2019t strong because the academy had meant for them to be for students to help pick up battle experience. There won\u2019t be any strong magical beasts here, except\u2026\u201d He trailed off in thought.Jian Chen\u2019s silence caused Tie Ta to pause, \u201cExcept what\u2026\u201d\u201cUnless we come across a group of magical beasts. However, we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s here or not.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face was serious as he spoke. With his strength, Jian Chen would not find any problems if he came across a Class 1 Magical Beast, but if he came across a whole group of them, then there would be no way at all.Tie Ta wrinkled his eyebrows together and said uncertainly, \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be likely. I\u2019ve been in the forests many times and never saw a whole bunch of magical beasts together.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for sure we won\u2019t, I\u2019ve read up in the library on books pertaining to magical beasts. There are a few types of magical beasts that all live in a group together. Together, their power is strong and very rarely do they travel by themselves.\u201d Jian Chen walked over to where the decapitated snake head was and only then did he realized that the viper was only 6 to 7 meters long. Using the iron rod to cut 7 meters in, he took out the rod from the viper\u2019s body to reveal a bloody crystal.Within the Tian Yuan continent, there were many different types of monster cores, while their monster cores were not at all like each other. Some magical beasts had their monster core in the head, some in the pit of their stomachs, and some in their abdomen. The viper for example had its monster core within it\u2019s tail, but Jian Chen had already known that a long time ago.\u201cPeng!\u201d Tie Ta brought down the battle axe on his shoulder into a tree. It sunk into the tree as smoothly like water in a bucket before he cried out loudly, \u201cIf there really are magical beasts that are in a group, I Tie Ta will definitely kill them all!\u201dJian Chen held the monster core he got from the cyan viper and rubbed it clean of blood with the nearby grass. Throwing it to Tie Ta, he said, \u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need to yell. There\u2019s a lot of magical beasts that travel in herds in the Tian Yuan continent, but it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll meet up with one for sure. Nothing is for sure, after all, this is the magical beast forest.\u201dTie Ta snatched the monster core thrown at him and looked at Jian Chen weirdly, \u201cWhat are you doing giving this to me?\u201dJian Chen laughed, \u201cThe viper was slain by you, so this monster core is yours by rights.\u201d Seeing Tie Ta trying to find a way to find a reason against this, Jian Chen continued to say, \u201cThis monster core is yours, don\u2019t say otherwise. Just take it. After all we still have 3 more days, at our current rate we\u2019ll definitely be able to get a lot more, so I don\u2019t really care for this one monster core.\u201d\u201cHaha, okay then. I\u2019ll be taking this monster core. The next monster core will be yours no matter who kills it then.\u201d Holding the bloodstained monster core high up in the air, Tie Ta was extremely happy. Though that was for sure since this was the first monster core he had gotten after killing a Class 1 Magical Beast.Afterwards, the two of them continued on their way. Now that he knew that Jian Chen had an acute sense for detecting danger, Tie Ta had simply handed the patrolling duties to Jian Chen. On the other hand, he began to ceaselessly hack at the grass in front of them to clear their path. Although constantly waving the heavy battleaxe around expended a great amount of energy, it was as simple as eating a meal to Tie Ta, who had godly strength. To him, this action wasn\u2019t the slightest bit taxing; after all, his strength was great enough to frighten others, and he seemed to have infinite amounts of energy as well. Thus, it was impossible for him to become exhausted in a situation like this.Not long after the two had left, Jian Chen\u2019s ears twitched, and his footsteps came to an abrupt halt. He stretched his hand out towards Tie Ta, who was currently slashing at the grass in front of them, and gestured at him to be silent.Tie Ta intuitively understood the situation, and stopped his attempt at hacking through the weeds. Tightly gripping the battleaxe, he returned to Jian Chen\u2019s side, and stood shoulder to shoulder with him. Tie Ta\u2019s eyes flashed, as he inspected their surroundings with caution.Their breathing became very faint, as their expressions were filled with caution. The difference between the two was that Tie Ta was constantly looking around, while Jian Chen had gently closed his eyes in attempt to sense everything around them.It was currently extremely difficult to discern anything among the grass. Even if there really was an unknown danger lurking around, it would unfortunately not be something that one could use the naked eye to see. Thus, Tie Ta could not discover anything despite sweeping his gaze around all four corners for a long period of time.Jian Chen lightly closed his eyes, his keen ears twitching periodically as they tried to catch all noises coming from his surroundings. At the same time, his consciousness also reached new heights, and he used his powerful \u201cSoul\u201d to reach out and sense the world around him.At that moment, Jian Chen could not help but recall one of his fights against Dugu Qiubai. Eventually, just as he was about to die, his powers had suddenly broken through and reached the Realm of the Sword God. At that moment, his \u201csoul\u201d had became incomparably strong and could even manifest it outside his body into the surrounding air. Whenever he spread his \u201csoul\u201d out into an area, then there would be no way anyone or anything inside would be able to escape his perception.However, what made Jian Chen feel regret was that after entering this world, although his soul was extremely powerful, he could no longer extend it outwards. Otherwise, this dense forest would not give Jian Chen any difficulties at all. Searching for a hidden magical beast would be extremely easy.Jian Chen\u2019s soul densely concentrated together, and he exerted all his efforts to sense his surroundings. Slowly, his spirit entered a unique state; although he had not extended his soul, at that instant, his soul seemed to have established a subtle relationship with the various plants around him, fusing together. This feeling was extremely mysterious.However, as soon as Jian Chen entered this state, he senses immediately shot up to new levels. Finally, a barely discernable breathing sound entered his sensing range. The breath was so faint that even if one stood next to it, one most likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear it.In an instant, Jian Chen\u2019s opened his eyes, and in a flash, he had already disappeared from his original location, and was flying towards the side at high speeds. While moving, Jian Chen constantly twisted and adjusted his body to evade the branches obstructing his path.In an instant, Jian Chen had already crossed over a distance of 10 meters. He quickly thrusted out the iron rod in his hands at lightning fast speed, silently cutting away the surrounding leaves and weeds, the tip aimed towards the the black figure hiding within the grass.\u201cAo!\u201dA shriek of pain suddenly rang out, as a dark shadow jumped out from the grass, leaping towards Jian Chen with its ferocious mouth wide open.This was a black panther, around 2 meters long. Its head had an open wound where fresh blood was pouring out from. The blood flowed down through the black fur on its face, intensifying its fierce appearance.Jian Chen\u2019s gaze was as sharp as a sword as a sneer began to form on his face. He shook his arm, and once again lashed out with the iron rod in his hand at an unfathomable speed, his objective being the black panther\u2019s neck. Up until the end, the black panther had absolutely no time to react, as the iron rod\u2019s sharp point plunged deeply through its throat. In addition, since the black panther\u2019s body was currently lunging in the air, its heavy body quickly dropped downwards, pushing the iron rod deeper and deeper through its neck. Eventually, the point had drilled a hole directly through, and the end had come out of the other side.This time, the black panther didn\u2019t even have the time to cry out before it had already died. It fell to the ground with its eyes wide open, grief instilled in its gaze.At that moment, Tie Ta finally caught up from behind. When he looked over at the ground, he saw the corroded iron rod pierced through the black panther\u2019s throat. Immediately, his eyes widened in extreme shock.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this\u2026.this\u2026.did you kill this?\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s voice was trembling in shock. Even though he had witnessed the moment that Jian Chen\u2019s weapon had pierced through the black panther\u2019s throat, he still couldn\u2019t believe the scene no matter how hard he tried. That was because the period of time that had passed was way too short; when Jian Chen had charged over, Tie Ta had already followed behind at his fastest speed. However, by the time he had caught up, all he saw was the Class 1 Magical Beast dying by Jian Chen\u2019s hands. The amount of time that had passed was definitely not even long enough to take a breath, or even half a breath.Being able to kill a Class 1 Magical Beast in half a breath\u2019s time was natural for some professionals. However, Tie Ta clearly knew that Jian Chen\u2019s abilities had not yet reached Saint level. Moreover, the weapon he was using was a mere corroded iron rod.Jian Chen placed his foot on the black panther\u2019s head, and gradually pulled out the iron rod. As if nothing had happened, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I killed it. However, it was just a coincidence. Originally, there was no way it would\u2019ve died so quickly. However, it kept approaching my weapon, and in the end, its life was extinguished before it could even cry out in despair.\u201dHearing this, Tie Ta rubbed the back of his head, and doubtfully glanced at Jian Chen\u2019s indifferent face. In disbelief, he asked, \u201cIs that true? You\u2019re not lying to me?\u201dJian Chen laughed, \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. Why would I lie to you?\u201dSeeing Jian Chen\u2019s sincere expression, Tie Ta was beyond puzzled, and muttered, \u201cDo such stupid magical beasts really exist, to actually give itself up to a weapon?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Life threatening dangers could happen at any time, but to Jian Chen and Tie Ta, it was almost as if they were playing a game. The 2nd region was like a treasure trove of monster cores for those two.The day passed quickly and nightfall came, both Jian Chen and Tie Ta found an open area in the forest to camp out in. Between them was a campfire with a fire that pulsed as it illuminated the pitch blackness. The two boy\u2019s shadows danced behind their backs, making their reflections seem like devils threatening each other.The darkness surrounded them from all four corners, and if they were to go outside the range of the bright fire, then they wouldn\u2019t even be able to see their own hands in front of their faces in the darkness. It wasn\u2019t that peaceful however, as somewhere in the distant forest, a magical beast could be heard howling away. Just the sound of it would terrify anyone, and for someone who was absolutely scared already, the sound would cause them to be scared stiff.Tie Ta turned the monster core in his hand over the fire, causing the light of the fire to shine on it. One look at the two boys revealed that their clothes were not in great condition and were splattered with blood.The blood was all from Magical Beasts while their clothes had been cut open due to the thorny shrubbery.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re really awesome! I didn\u2019t think that you would be able to wield a corroded iron rod to such an amazing degree, all of the magical beasts we fought against today were killed by you! It was only the initial viper from earlier that I managed to kill.\u201d Tie Ta exclaimed as he heaped praise onto Jian Chen.Jian Chen\u2019s face had a big smile on it, \u201cI only took a chance when I saw one, if it weren\u2019t for you dealing out damage with your axe, then it would have been even harder to kill those magical beasts.\u201dTie Ta laughed, his heart finally taking comfort in his words, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, could you tell me, how is it that you\u2019re able to tell if we\u2019re near a magical beast or not?\u201d Tie Ta was naturally very curious about this, the whole day he had been puzzling over it, but it was only now that he found the perfect time to ask.Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to hide anything and instead pointed at his ear and head, \u201cI used this and this.\u201dTie Ta looked at Jian Chen point at his ears and head in a curious way before asking, \u201cYou use your ears to listen and your mind to think?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re only half correct!\u201d Jian Chen took the iron rod by his side and began to polish it on a small chunk of rock. Absent mindedly responding, he said, \u201cAside from relying on my ears to listen, I use my spirit to feel my surroundings. However, this method would be too difficult for you to do.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Tie Ta nodded his head in understanding while thinking it over in his head.Jian Chen felt the fine point of the iron rod before putting it down. Grabbing onto his Space Belt, he said, \u201cTie Ta, let us check out our earnings from today.\u201d Shaking his Space Belt, the stored monster cores began to fall out.One after another, monster cores started to drop out from the space belt and gradually the spot in front of Jian Chen began to pile up with monster cores until it was a foot high.Tie Ta followed suit and started to shake his own Space Belt. In the end, a small mountain piled up in front of him as well.\u201cI have 48 monster cores here.\u201d Jian Chen laughed, his profits for today had been huge.\u201cI have 49 here, I\u2019ve beat you by one.\u201d Tie Ta was extremely happy, he had never seen this many cores before. This was a first for him, since he had never even seen a single monster core before. To Tie Ta who was born in a common household, these monster cores had a huge price tag on them despite all of the cores being Class 1.\u201cFor the first day to be this profitable, not bad! I don\u2019t know how many monster cores we\u2019d need in order to be the ones with the most monster cores. After all, the prize is quite rich; a Class 4 Monster Core and a Space Ring.\u201d Even Jian Chen had been tempted by the prizes, he really wanted that Class 4 Monster Core, the energy inside would be many times stronger than a Class 1 Monster Core.At this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s eye suddenly grew dark as he whispered, \u201cQuickly store all of the monster cores, people are coming.\u201d After saying that, he immediately started to store all of the cores into his belt and put it back on.Tie Ta moved quickly as well, the moment he heard Jian Chen start, he had already started to store all of the monster cores. Tie Ta had finished by the time Jian Chen did.After the two had stored their monster cores away, after a few nervous breaths, the distant grass moved to the side with a rustling sound as a very thin person came walking out. The moment the person saw both Tie Ta and Jian Chen sitting by a fire, a look of surprise came over their face before suddenly letting loose a cry of joy. It was a weak little lady holding onto a rice straw for support who came stumbling over.\u201cI finally found someone, I finally found someone! I beg of you, please don\u2019t leave me behind. I\u2019m afraid, really really afraid. The magical beasts want to eat me\u2026\u201d The person\u2019s voice was fairly frantic and was full of panic; however, her voice was still gentle somehow.Hearing her, Jian Chen and Tie Ta then realized the person in front of them was a girl as the fire behind them illuminated her body, showing her Kargath Academy uniform to the both of them. However, the uniform had been cut open by the branches and thorns, some parts of her body could already be seen underneath and even her underwear could be seen poking out. The uniform itself was muddy as if she had fallen multiple times.The girl\u2019s face was dirty with mud to the point where her appearance couldn\u2019t even be seen clearly. However, on her face could be seen evidence of her crying as she pleadingly looked at Jian Chen. Looking at the pitiful sight, there was nothing but helplessness reflected in her eyes.\u201cSit down.\u201d Jian Chen tried to make himself as kind as possible, looking at her situation, he had guessed what type of trouble had taken place. In this environment, even the most reckless of boys would feel horrified, let alone a little girl.Seeing that the person was actually a pretty girl, Tie Ta\u2019s guard loosened. Carefully putting down the battle axe in his hands, he looked at the girl curiously.Jian Chen calmly looked at the young girl, and asked, \u201cCan you tell me what your name is?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026my name is Liang Xiao Le,\u201d The young girl stuttered back. Seeing both Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s eyes flash, she could not help but feel fear, as well as some faint traces of concern and insecurity.\u201cWhy is a lady like you not with others? If you\u2019re so afraid, why would you walk through this forest alone? Just a few random sounds have even scared you to such an extent,\u201d Tie Ta asked in a muffled voice.Liang Xiao Le looked at Tie Ta timidly before she said quietly, \u201cI came here with a few friends at first, but unfortunately we came across a magical beast. That magical beast was quite strong, and my group of friends weren\u2019t able to beat it. Soon after most of us were injured and we all scattered to run away, but I got lost.\u201dHearing this, Tie Ta began to choke on his own saliva before saying, \u201cEven with a group you were unable to beat a Class 1 Magical Beast? How useless, just Changyang Xiang Tian and I have already killed over 100 magical beasts today.\u201d A proud look came over his face as he remembered that fact.\u201cGululu!\u201dAt that moment, a strange sound suddenly rang out. In an instant, Jian Chen and Tie Ta both directed their gazes to the origin of the sound. It turned out to be Liang Xiao Le\u2019s stomach, which at the moment, still would not stop grumbling loudly.\u201cYou must be hungry,\u201d Jian Chen smiled.\u201cYes!\u201d Liang Xiao Le nodded in embarrassment, and delicately said, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten all day.\u201d The corner of her eyes could not help but light up as she glanced at the bonfire, where the finely cooked, golden magical beast meat was currently dripping with rich oils. She greedily inhaled its aroma, but the more she did this, the louder her stomach grumbled. Eventually, both Jian Chen and Tie Ta could only hear rumbling sounds in their ears.Jian Chen smiled. He picked up the skewer with the magical meat on it, and unafraid of the heat, directly used his hand to tear off a large chunk of the meat. Handing it over to Liang Xiao Le, he said, \u201cGo on and eat this. Be careful it\u2019s hot though.\u201dLiang Xiao Le twisted her hands, and ripped the corners of her clothes to wipe clean the dirt on her hands. Tenderly, she reached over to receive the magical beast meat. Once it had cooled down, she directly ate it with large mouthfuls, not caring to keep up her appearance in the least.Liang Xiao Le was probably starving, because after she quickly finished that large piece of meat, she still gazed at the remaining piece with a wistful look in her eyes.Jian Chen smiled, and ripped off another large chunk of magical beast meat. He handed it over to Liang Xiao Le and said, \u201cGo ahead and eat this.\u201dSeeing the piece of magical beast meat that had placed in front of her, Liang Xiao Le hesitated for a bit, and in the end, still didn\u2019t reach out to receive it. Instead, she gazed at Jian Chen and Tie Ta and softly asked, \u201cIf I finish it, what will you guys eat?\u201dTie Ta laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we still have another one left. Look under that tree.\u201d As he said this, Tie Ta extended a finger to point in the direction.Liang Xiao Le looked at where Tie Ta was pointing, and sure enough, she noticed that underneath a large tree nearby, an unknown magical beast had fallen to the ground. One of its legs had already disappeared, and the ground was covered with fresh blood marks.Staring at the magical beast\u2019s corpse, Liang Xiao Le swallowed hard and said, \u201cYou guys are really formidable. To think that the two of you alone could kill a Class 1 Magical Beast.\u201d\u201cChe\u2026.What does that mean?\u201d Tie Ta said, completely unperturbed.The time stealthily flew by. Jian Chen and Tie Ta had finished eating, and were now preparing to rest.\u201cHey, where should i sleep?\u201d Liang Xiao Le asked with difficulty.Jian Chen pointed at a large tree not too far away and said, \u201cGo rest on top of that tree. That way, even if magical beasts try to attack in the middle of the night, you won\u2019t be harmed.\u201d\u201cAh, magical beasts still attack during the night?\u201d Liang Xiao Le\u2019s face turned ashen at these words. Her eyes were filled with fear, and her whole body began to tremble.\u201cThen what about you guys? Where would you guys go? You can\u2019t just leave me behind alone, otherwise I\u2019ll definitely be eaten by some savage magical beast,\u201d Liang Xiao Le asked in a panicked tone. She nervously glanced at Jian Chen and Tie Ta, as if afraid for her life if they ran away and abandoned her.Jian Chen internally sighed. He really couldn\u2019t do anything about the cowardly Liang Xiao Le. People like her who had been born and raised in noble families as a precious little girl had never experienced the stormy sea. From birth, she had grown up into a sheltered environment, so encountering any danger drove her heart and mind into disarray.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t go far. We\u2019re just going to rest in the other tree over there,\u201d Jian Chen said.Liang Xiao Le felt slightly comforted after hearing these words. However, traces of fear still remained in her heart, refusing to go away.\u201cThat damned school, that damned headmaster! Why do they have to force everyone to attend this type of event for no reason at all? Isn\u2019t this just deliberately trying to send us to our deaths?\u201d Whenever she thought about how she had gotten into her current situation, Liang Xiao Le could not help but start cursing in anger. Eventually her words gradually began to turn into sobs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The torch by their side had long since burned out, and in a tree branch 5 or 6 meters above them, was Liang Xiao Le. She nervously looked around whenever she heard the howl of a magical beast in the night, she wasn\u2019t able to sleep at all.Liang Xiao Le\u2019s bright eyes looked down at the cultivating pair, Jian Chen and Tie Ta, as if she was monitoring them. In her eyes, this was a matter of life or death. She did not want to see the two people she had found, after a long time of searching, to abandon her and lose her only type of protection.At that moment, a light breeze blew through the forest and through the tall grass. Meanwhile, the cross-legged Jian Chen suddenly opened his eyes. Immediately, his eyes grew bright as he stared deep into the tallgrass, before standing up onto the ground with the iron rod in his hand.Liang Xiao Le was confused as she watched Jian Chen stand up. Not knowing what was happening, her heart was suddenly very agitated.\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d Liang Xiao Le whispered carefully. In this situation, she didn\u2019t dare use a loud voice to speak, for fear of attracting another magical beast.Jian Chen didn\u2019t answer her and instead turned to the still cultivating Tie Ta. \u201cTie Ta, wake up, some magical beasts are attacking.\u201d\u201cAh, what did you say? Magical beasts are attacking?\u201d Liang Xiao Le became frightened, her face instantly draining of color. Thinking about what was about to happen, her whole body began to shake in fear.While Tie Ta was cultivating, he didn\u2019t dare immerse himself completely, so he still remained on guard while cultivating. Thus, when Jian Chen called for him, Tie Ta immediately woke from his cultivation state and stood up with his battleaxe rested against his shoulder.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, where are the monsters?\u201d He asked as he looked around. He couldn\u2019t see any footprints around them, or even hear a single sound.Jian Chen slowly turned his head as he looked around, \u201cTie Ta, this time, be careful. This time it isn\u2019t a single magical beast, but a group of them.\u201d\u201cA group!\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s face immediately changed from careless to surprise, then it hardened into a ready expression.\u201cAh! What! A group! It can\u2019t be! Hey guys, please don\u2019t scare me like that.\u201d Hiding in the trees, Liang Xiao Le pleaded with them. She would have rather heard a threat from Jian Chen than this.Jian Chen\u2019s eyebrows knitted together before lightly commanding the crying Liang Xiao Le, \u201cCould you please be quiet? Do you want to attract magical beasts from all over?\u201dJian Chen\u2019s command proved to be extremely useful, as Liang Xiao Le immediately used her hand to clamp her mouth shut to make sure she didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, how many magical beasts do you think there are?\u201d Tie Ta asked.\u201cA lot, 10 at the very least. They\u2019re all prepared to attack and already have us surrounded.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face was very grave.Tie Ta\u2019s expression grew hard as he heard Jian Chen. If it was just one magical beast, he wouldn\u2019t have been worried, three magical beasts and the both of them combined could take them on. But now that there were at least 10 of them; Tie Ta didn\u2019t dare to have a swelled head now.When Liang Xiao Le had heard Jian Chen, her already pale face had turned even paler, and her mind was wracked with fear. Only one thought was occurring in her head, \u201cIt\u2019s over, we\u2019re screwed! We\u2019re not going to survive this\u2026\u201dThe tall grass began to sway as a cyan colored light appeared in front of them. There was one in every direction, with no less than 50 points of origin. As Jian Chen and Tie Ta looked on amazed, they realized the bright spots of light were actually the eyes of magical beasts, and there were at the very least 20 of them.\u201cThis is a Class 1 Magical Beast Blue Wolf. Tie Ta, if you want to live, hurry and climb up a tree now,\u201d Jian Chen said as he looked at the 20 Blue Wolves from all 4 directions.Tie Ta glared in anger before brandishing his battleaxe, with a heroic voice he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Changyang Xiang Tian, there are only 20 Class 1 Magical Beasts, I guarantee they won\u2019t take us down.\u201dThe moment she heard that there were 20 wolves invading, Liang Xiao Le was practically scared to death. At this time, even if she believed in Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s strengths before, she would never believe that their strengths would be able to beat 20 magical beasts, as they hadn\u2019t even reached Sainthood yet. Unless one of the school teachers were to come save them now, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape alive.\u201cTeacher, where are you? Please come save us\u2026\u201d Liang Xiao Le looked around in all directions as she pleaded for a teacher to come. She could only trust that the teachers would come to save them now, but it was a shame that there were so many magical beasts, so she was too scared to cry out too loudly. Just in case the magical beasts focused on her.The 20 Blue Wolves slowly walked towards Jian Chen and Tie Ta, their oily gazes staring attentively at them. It was only when their distance was less than 5 meters away that they stopped moving.Jian Chen and Tie Ta grabbed onto their respective weapons. Although they were surrounded by 20 magical beasts, neither of the two had a single expression of fear..\u201cAooo!\u201dSuddenly, a Blue Wolf started to cry out into the sky. Immediately afterwards, the 20 wolves surrounding them started to howl as well. Their howls filled the air as they began to overlap with each other, before turning into a large soundwave that targeted a wide area.Hearing the wolves howl, Liang Xiao Le\u2019s entire body slipped. Her body fell to the ground as she started to tremble. At this point, her face was entirely drained of blood, and had become a deathly pale shade.5 kilometers away from Jian Chen, a middle aged male dropped down onto a tree branch. When he heard the howls, his face changed. His previously closed eyes opened as he stared off towards the direction of the sound.\u201cNot good, that\u2019s a pack of Blue Wolves. Judging by the howls there are at least 10 of them. It looks like someone has met up with danger then.\u201d The middle aged man\u2019s face grew solemn as his hands touched the tree he was standing on. He jumped down from the tree before sprinting off towards the direction of the howls without stopping.\u201cI hope that I can make it.\u201d The middle aged man was anxious, but he was already going at the fastest speed he could possibly go at. The magical beasts in the 2nd area weren\u2019t that strong, but the opponents Jian Chen and Tie Ta were facing were Class 1 Magical Beast Blue Wolves; their chances of success weren\u2019t looking well.At the same time, in 3 different places, 3 different people all heard the yell before putting down whatever was in their hands and quickly started to run towards the howl.The wolves\u2019 howl was the signal for the wolves to attack, as the 20 wolves suddenly rushed at Jian Chen and Tie Ta.\u201cGo die!\u201d Tie Ta snarled as he brought his battle axe up in preparation to strike. He swiped at a nearby wolf with his axe, slamming the axe into its stomach. The wolf cried out with an ear-piercing shriek.\u201cPeng!\u201dThe Blue Wolf that charged at Tie Ta was immediately cut down by his battleaxe\u2019s powerful attack, and it now sported a giant wound on its body.The wolf was sent flying away from the mighty swing; despite it being a Class 1 Magical Beast, it was no match for Tie Ta\u2019s strength.Tie Ta brandished his 100 pound battleaxe with ease as if it wasn\u2019t heavy at all. Whenever a Blue Wolf approached, he would send it flying away. Thus, any wolf that got too close to him was sent flying, with a new wound on its body. However, the skin of a Blue Wolf was tough, so even Tie Ta couldn\u2019t kill one with ease.As the wolves approached him at the same time, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes instantly grew cold as he dashed forward. In a flash, he brought the sharpened iron rod through the throat of a nearby wolf.\u201cPuu!\u201dWith some resistance, the iron rod finally pierced through the wolf\u2019s hide and bore through the wolf\u2019s throat. He took out the rod and tilted his body to the side to dodge the attack of another wolf who jumped at him.The wolf who had its throat pierced by Jian Chen fell helplessly to the ground, as its four legs spasmed in its final death throes. It couldn\u2019t stand up on its legs no matter how much it tried, as bright red blood leaked out from its wound.The throat was the weak-point for almost every single living thing, and magical beasts were no exception. Right now, since the Blue Wolf had its throat skewered, its life was quickly fading. Even though it was trying to avoid the temptation of death, its struggle would not last long.Jian Chen relied on the nimbleness of his body to weave in and out of the pack of wolves, and he used his iron rod to leave behind stab wounds wherever he attacked. Despite being surrounded by 10 wolves, Jian Chen had used his strange but unpredictable style of movement to dodge with ease. The sharp teeth and the claws of the wolves couldn\u2019t touch him at all, and whenever it had seemed like the wolves would be able to get him, Jian Chen moved out of the way just in time.The battle hadn\u2019t even lasted for more than a few deep breaths before 3 of the wolves had their throats pierced by Jian Chen. As the wolves lost blood, they stumbled to the ground in a final struggle to live, but after one final breath, they died on the ground. Many of the wolves had suffered from multiple wounds, but none of them were fatal, and were focused on the joints of the beasts.Jian Chen proceeded to travel in between the wolves as the iron rod in his hand continued to stab at them. Not only were his movements swift, but there was a certain grace to them; it was almost as if he was dancing instead of fighting for his life.On the other side, Tie Ta let loose a snarl and brought his 100 pound battleaxe down through the air, producing an after image thanks to the speed. The few wolves surrounding him were continuously sent flying through the air with exceptionally terrifying wounds. Although the wounds were from Tie Ta\u2019s sharp battleaxe, to the Blue Wolves, these injuries would not threaten their lives at all.Although Tie Ta was looking quite powerful and majestic at this moment, he was not invincible. And with Jian Chen\u2019s success so far, Tie Ta\u2019s own achievements were nothing much. After all, ever since the start of the battle, Tie Ta had not yet been able to kill a single Blue Wolf.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Another wolf died by Jian Chen\u2019s hands, while countless others were being injured.The cowering Liang Xiao Le didn\u2019t hear Tie Ta\u2019s or Jian Chen\u2019s screams of pain at all. All she could hear was the howling of the Blue Wolves mixed in with whimpers. Because of her curiosity, she fought her fear and looked down on the ground, and her eyes grew wide in shock. She couldn\u2019t believe that Jian Chen and Tie Ta were still fighting the Blue Wolves, and she was shocked speechless.Every single swing from Tie Ta\u2019s axe was capable of smashing a wolf into the air with ease. No wolf was able to get close to him because of that, and most of the Blue Wolves were covered with frightening wounds that had covered their entire bodies with blood. Jian Chen, on the other hand, was moving rapidly between the wolves and attacking them from every direction. Whenever he thrusted his iron rod forward, another wolf would be riddled with wounds. His movements were too fast for Liang Xiao Le to follow; the only thing she could see was a constant blurs.She had never experienced such a hair raising bloody spectacle like the one below, but on the outside, her face had already started to regain some color. However, her body had not yet stopped trembling. After all, it was her first time seeing such a bloody mess, and no matter who it was, a person wouldn\u2019t be able to take in a sight like this easily their first time.At that moment, a Blue Wolf took advantage of Tie Ta\u2019s lack of attention, and jumped at his shoulder. Using its strong teeth, it bit deeply down on his shoulder and blood started to flow freely from the wound.The acute pain caused Tie Ta\u2019s face to darken as he looked at the Blue Wolf biting at his shoulder. Tie Ta\u2019s eye blinked in pain as he looked at the Blue Wolf with a fierce glare. Dropping his battleaxe, his right hand grabbed onto the wolf\u2019s head, and with his monstrous strength, he ripped the wolf off his shoulder, leaving behind deep incisions in his skin.Tie Ta grabbed onto the wolf\u2019s snout with both hands, and the veins in his arms swelled up with his muscles. With a furious roar, his hands gripped onto the yelping wolf and tore its head from its body. At the same time, blood splattered everywhere onto Tie Ta, dying him blood red.Tie Ta\u2019s act of strength caused the surrounding wolves to cower in fear, as they watched Tie Ta hold onto the two halves of the wolf\u2019s carcass.But Tie Ta didn\u2019t plan to let the wolves get away. Dropping the body, he picked up his battleaxe and sliced down onto another wolf\u2019s head.The wolf tilted its head and dodged Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe. Bringing its head up towards the sky, it let out a great howl before launching itself at him.Hearing the howl, all of the wolves had their fear dispelled, as they instantly charged at Tie Ta.Tie Ta sent a kick towards the abdomen of a wolf, sending it flying through the air. The sharp blade of his battleaxe cut into the neck of the wolf. Leaving behind a trail of blood, the wolf flew backwards like a rocket.After his battleaxe had chopped through the head of a wolf, Tie Ta stopped where he stood. He brandished his battleaxe in a menacing way for the other wolves to see.\u201cPeng!\u201d A wolf was too late in dodging and was hit by Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe. The wolf was split in two as it gave one last final howl.After being injured, it looked as if Tie Ta became even stronger. In a flash, he had already killed 2 wolves.Jian Chen, on the other hand, was still wrestling fiercely with the wolves. Suddenly, a wolf jumped from above, down onto Jian Chen.Jian Chen immediately turned around and glared at the incoming wolf with his flashing eyes. The iron rod in his hand shot forth like lightning and stabbed deep into the wolf\u2019s abdomen, piercing its heart. The moment he felt the rod stop, he immediately pulled it out and then moved away from his position.The moment he left from his spot, the group of Blue Wolves immediately lunged at him.The wolf that had been skewered in the heart whimpered as it gave its final breath, and fell down to the ground, spasming before finally becoming still.The battle persisted for some time, and as time passed, the amount of Blue Wolves that had died by the hands of Jian Chen and Tie Ta grew larger and larger. Gradually, the pressure on the two boys reduced, as the number of Blue Wolves dwindled.Jian Chen pulled out his iron rod from another wolf\u2019s throat; he had already killed over 10 Blue Wolves, yet his clothes were relatively unstained by the blood.Jian Chen looked to Tie Ta only to see 7 or 8 Blue Wolves left; however, each of the 8 wolves were already bloody, as if they had been bathed in blood. His already ragged clothing was becoming even worse, and was almost like a strip of cloth now. His clothes were no longer protecting his body, and instead revealed his chest underneath. Even the trousers had rips in parts, with blood dripping from the wounds beneath it.Without any hesitation, Jian Chen rushed towards Tie Ta and immediately started to fight off the 8 wolves with his iron rod.Because Tie Ta had gave the wolves many heavy injuries in a long battle, the wolves were all exhausted beyond relief, so Jian Chen\u2019s job was relatively easy. Without expending much energy, he ended their lives by accurately piercing each of the wolves\u2019 throats.After the invasion of the pack of wolves, even Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but breathe hard. Even though he was not weak at all, he had used up the majority of his energy to fight against the pack of wolves.Tie Ta let out a long sigh as he looked at the pile of dead bodies around him. On his face was a happy smile; although they had just fought a long and hard battle, he didn\u2019t show a single trace of exhaustion. Instead, his fighting spirit was awakened.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, let\u2019s kill the rest of the Class 1 Magical Beasts.\u201d Tie Ta laughed. In his lifetime, he had never killed a Class 1 Magical Beast before, so it was natural that he was excited.Jian Chen smiled as well before looking at the wounds on Tie Ta, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, how bad is it?\u201dTie Ta looked down on his body to inspect his wounds before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Although the bites hurt, they\u2019re mostly superficial wounds. Hehe, my skin has been thick since I was small, so regular beasts could never bite me before.\u201dJian nodded his head in understanding with a thoughtful face. He knew about Tie Ta\u2019s strength and vitality first hand. Tie Ta was even stronger than a steel bar, so the Blue Wolves must\u2019ve been ferocious to bite through his skin.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right, Changyang Xiang Tian, are you hurt?\u201d Tie Ta asked with concern as he looked at Jian Chen.Jian Chen shook his head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the wolves didn\u2019t hurt me at all.\u201d He shifted his stare to the tall grass and said loudly, \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen enough, how long do you plan on hiding there?\u201dHearing Jian Chen, Tie Ta went blank for a second as he was puzzled by what Jian Chen was saying. But he soon figured it out and immediately grabbed onto his battleaxe with both his hands.\u201cWho\u2019s hiding over? Hurry up and come out otherwise I\u2019ll chop you in half!\u201d Tie Ta yelled.As Tie Ta spoke, the tall grass rustled before them as four figures leapt out in front of Tie Ta and Jian Chen.Seeing the four shadows jump out, Tie Ta immediately went on the defensive, while Jian Chen didn\u2019t move a muscle except for a small smile on his face. Although they couldn\u2019t see the appearances of the four due to the darkness, but Jian Chen had long since guessed their identities.When the four shadows reached 2 meters away from Jian Chen, they suddenly stopped. Jian Chen could finally see their faces clearly; two of them were middle aged men while there was an elder and a 30 year old female. All four of them had a look of astonishment and were stupefied as if they saw an inconceivable event.\u201cHonorable teachers, so it was you.\u201d Tie Ta finally recognized the four people and cried out in surprise.The four people quickly regained their composure, but their eyes still revealed traces of shock.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, no wonder there are rumors about you being able to beat a Saint. I didn\u2019t think too much about it at first, but after seeing this, the rumors have to have some sort of truth to them. For a single person to use a corroded iron rod to kill dozens of Class 1 Magical beasts, even Saints who condensed their Saint Weapons wouldn\u2019t be able to replicate this easily.\u201d The elder said with a laugh as he praised Jian Chen.Jian Chen laughed and said, \u201cHonored teacher gives this one too much praise. My strength isn\u2019t as strong as you think; the wolves may have been Class 1 Magical Beasts, but their attack power wasn\u2019t that high. If I had came across a stronger Class 1 Magical Beast, then I\u2019m afraid I would\u2019ve struggled a lot more.\u201dHearing this, the elder looked at Jian Chen appreciatively before looking at Tie Ta with a laugh, \u201cTie Ta, your strength is also very strong, it\u2019s no wonder the headmaster noticed you and took you in as an apprentice.\u201dTia Ta scratched his head with a modest smile, but he didn\u2019t know what to say in response to that.\u201cElder Yun, it would appear that we came here for nothing. These two are absolutely abnormal in strength, nothing in the 2nd region would be a match for them.\u201d Said the 30 year old woman.The other 3 bitterly smiled as they listened to her.When they had heard the howls of the wolves, they naturally knew that a student was in danger. For that reason alone they had all rushed towards the howls at the fastest speed possible to rescue them. On the way, each one of them prayed that the students would be able to hold on for as long as possible, but when they had arrived, they were subjected to an inconceivable sight. Two students who weren\u2019t at the Saint level had been able to fend off 20 or so Blue Wolves without trouble. In the end, they had been able to slaughter all 20 of them, and none of the 4 could believe their eyes at this end result.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The four of them were extremely interested in knowing how they were detected while hiding in the tall grass because they had not made a single sound or made any movement, so there was no way that they would have been noticed by Jian Chen.Jian Chen laughed and said, \u201cI had found out the moment the honorable teachers arrived.\u201d\u201cWhat! You found out the moment we arrived? How is that possible?\u201d The woman cried out in disbelief.The other 3 people couldn\u2019t believe what Jian Chen said either.Jian Chen opened his mouth, \u201cWhile I was fighting the pack of wolves, I was still paying attention to my surroundings. Otherwise, we might have been subjected to random attacks from someone else; how would I dare lose track of what was happening around me at such a crucial point?\u201dHearing this, the four teachers nodded, approving of what Jian Chen had just said.Jian Chen continued to explain, \u201cThe honorable teachers didn\u2019t make a single sound at all, but when you arrived I saw a bunch of obvious movements, so I found out since the very beginning.\u201dHearing this, the four people realized their mistakes as the elder sighed in admiration, \u201cAmazing, just amazing! Changyang Xiang Tian, I really have no other choice but to admire you. And to think that when I was your age, I was nowhere near the level you are now.\u201d The elder then paused before saying, \u201cSince you students aren\u2019t in any danger, then we\u2019ll take our leave now, after all, there are still students to save.\u201d Although the elder had said that, he looked as if he was reluctant to leave.\u201cPlease wait!\u201d Jian Chen suddenly cried out towards the four teachers. Pointing at Liang Xiao Le who was still hiding in the tree, he said, \u201cHonored teacher, could you please help escort this student out? She doesn\u2019t have the courage to stay here any longer.\u201dThe teacher frowned as he thought about it, \u201cThis won\u2019t be a problem, but even if she hands over two Class 1 Monster Cores, this will still be considered as a loss. After all, she didn\u2019t stay here for all 3 days.\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll definitely stay here for all 3 days.\u201d Liang Xiao Le said from the treetop as she dropped 5 or 6 meters down onto the ground. In one long stride she went over to where Jian Chen was.\u201cHey, these four teachers can take you out of this forest so you won\u2019t have to worry about magical beasts hurting you. Why don\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d Tie Ta was rather discontent, since Liang Xiao Le was really too cowardly. The moment she saw a magical beast she cried out loud; this really annoyed Tia Ta\u2026Liang Xiao Le looked at Tie Ta timidly and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\u201cCould it be you\u2019re no longer afraid of magical beasts?\u201d Tie Ta asked curiously.\u201cI am!\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re scared after all, then why don\u2019t you want to get out of here?\u201d\u201cBecause you two are still here.\u201dWith such a straightforward answer, Tie Ta couldn\u2019t find a response.Jian Chen looked at Liang Xiao Le helplessly before trying to persuade her, \u201cLiang Xiao Le, you should go with the teachers, the magical beasts in this forest are many, and so there\u2019s no guarantee that we can protect you.\u201dLiang Xiao Le\u2019s face became miserable as she realized that she would need to depend on Jian Chen. Imploring, she said, \u201cSenior, please let me go with you, this was my first time seeing a magical beast and the first time I\u2019ve been here. That\u2019s why I was scared initially. But I guarantee you, the next time we come across a magical beast, I won\u2019t cry out loud.\u201d After experiencing Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s strengths, Liang Xiao Le wouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting into any trouble with those two around. Plus, Liang Xiao Le had clearly that the four teachers all said that the 2nd region of the forest had nothing that they couldn\u2019t handle. So with such good protection, there was no way she would give up that easily.Jian Chen suddenly felt a headache coming. Liang Xiao Le was a pampered noble since birth, so she would definitely be a burden to them. When they battled any magical beasts in the future, they would have to look after her as well.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, with you and Tie Ta, there are no magical beasts in the 2nd region that can pose a threat to you. so you might as well take her along. Students should look out for one another. And besides, for you two, this shouldn\u2019t even be considered a test anymore.\u201d Laughed the middle-aged woman.Jian Chen inwardly sighed in exasperation. Since even the teachers wanted Liang Xiao Le to tag along, he couldn\u2019t find any reasons to object.Although Jian Chen was giving in, Tie Ta was still not satisfied, but he didn\u2019t say anything. After this first day, he had already started to see Jian Chen as the pillar of the team. Whatever his decision was, Tie Ta would not object to it. Jian Chen\u2019s mind was better at strategy and he had more experience dealing with beasts than Tie Ta\u2019s. So it could be said that no matter what, Tie Ta would concede to Jian Chen.After the four teachers left, Jian Chen and Tie Ta didn\u2019t pay attention to Liang Xiao Le and instead went to the dead bodies of the Blue Wolves. Since it was over 20 Class 1 Monster Cores, they wouldn\u2019t dare to squander this.Because the monster cores of the Blue Wolves were in their heads, Tie Ta and Jian Chen were trying to find a way to extract them. They definitely needed to strike and break at the part of the head where the monster core was, so Liang Xiao Le\u2019s face went pale as she observed them. Perhaps Liang Xiao Le had changed only slightly, it was almost as if she no longer felt out of her league. With great difficulty, she was able to quell the cowardly nature within her, as she diligently watched Jian Chen and Tie Ta work at extracting the cores. It was almost as if she was learning from the experience.The night passed quickly and peacefully after the initial Blue Wolves raid.As the dawn sun slowly rose over the edge of the horizon, the cross-legged Jian Chen finished his cultivation, and stood up to stretch.Just as Jian Chen stood up, he heard Tie Ta start to awaken as well. He followed Jian Chen up, and although the two were in the middle of cultivating, they were still aware of their surroundings. They had put up a guard while cultivating, and as long as the wind blew through the tall grass, then the pair would be able to track anyone.\u201cTie Ta, go find some dry branches for the fire. I\u2019ll go fetch the magical beast meat; it\u2019s about time we prepare some breakfast,\u201d Jian Chen said.\u201cOh!\u201d Without any objects, Tie Ta turned around and entered the forest to search for some dry firewood.Soon after, Tie Ta carried over a pile of dry firewood. At the same time, Jian Chen had prepared a huge chunk of bloody magical beast meat from the Blue Wolves that had been killed by them last night.Since there were no sources of water in the area, the magical beast meat was not washed. Instead, it was directly skewered with some sticks, and was placed above the bonfire to begin roasting.Not long after, the roasted magical beast meat began to emit a fragrant aroma. Although it did not have any spices, the quality of the magical beast meat was originally high. Moreover, the higher the class of the magical beast, the more delicious its meat would taste, and the more beneficial it was to the body. It was said that a Class 5 Magical Beast\u2019s meat could even boost one\u2019s strength.Perhaps because she could smell the magical beast meat\u2019s fragrance, Liang Xiao Le awoke from her nap on top of the tree, and jumped down. The 5-6 meter height was nothing to Liang Xiao Le, who had reached the 8th Saint Force layer.\u201cWa\u2026it smells so good.\u201d Liang Xiao Le bounced over to the bonfire, and seeing the golden magical beast meat dripping in rich oils, she could not help but swallow hard. Although she had eaten many exotic delicacies, she had never eaten wild game like this before. After all, eating the same type of meat for so long, one would obviously think of anything else as more appetizing, even if it was just some cabbage.Tie Ta shot a dissatisfied glance at Liang Xiao Le, and murmured in a quiet voice, \u201cLast night you were crying so loudly; now you\u2019ve forgotten about it all so quickly. I hope that when we encounter more magical beasts later, you won\u2019t start wailing again.\u201dTie Ta\u2019s voice was extremely soft and unclear. Most likely, aside from himself, nobody would have been able to clearly hear what he had whispered, even Jian Chen.Liang Xiao Le looked at Tie Ta in curiosity, \u201cTie Ta, what are you saying?\u201d Last night, the four teachers had called out Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s names, so Liang Xiao Le had already learned their identities.\u201cAh, nothing.\u201d Tie Ta waved his hands as if he was feeling guilty for something.Liang Xiao Le didn\u2019t pay any mind to it. She gazed at Jian Chen and Tie Ta and smiled, \u201cNo wonder you two are so powerful that you can kill 20 Class 1 Magical Beasts. It turns out that you two are actually Tie Ta and Changyang Xiang Tian. The fact that I was able to meet you two was really great luck.\u201d The current Liang Xiao Le seemed to be an entirely different person from the person yesterday evening. After only a single night, she seemed to already have pushed yesterday\u2019s events to the back of her mind. Now, her face didn\u2019t show a single trace of fear and dread from the thought of magical beasts.Jian Chen lifted the well cooked magical beast meat, and then ripped of a section, throwing it over to Liang Xiao Le, asking, \u201cThere are a lot of magical beasts in this forest. Moreover, if we don\u2019t stay for 3 more days, then we definitely cannot leave. Aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201dLiang Xiao Le accepted the piece of magical beast meat, and while she lightly chewed it, she said, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m still scared, I believe that I will eventually get used to it. In addition , the two of you are not much older than me, yet you both faced those fierce Blue Wolves last night without a trace of fear. The two of you even managed to slaughter all of them. This is much more impressive than those other boys. Hmph, those boys were so useless; the five of them together couldn\u2019t defeat a single magical beast. In the end, their incompetence forced me to get separated from my sisters.\u201dLiang Xiao Le suddenly stood up, and loudly declared, \u201cI\u2019ve decided now. I will definitely use these next two days to properly learn from you two seniors.\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen inwardly nodded to himself. Liang Xiao Le\u2019s statement had already gained Jian Chen\u2019s approval. Although she was timid, and was extremely afraid of magical beasts, that wasn\u2019t important. The most important factor was she was willing to change her ways, and to learn more.After all, nobody was born with the ability do and understand everything. All knowledge retained is a result of one going out to learn it. Of course, Jian Chen was an exception.On the other hand, Liang Xiao Le was born as the eldest daughter in a noble household. She had been spoiled since she was young, and had grown up in a sheltered environment. Obviously, she had never experienced any hardships. Thus, it was to be expected that she would inevitably be frightened during her first encounter with a savage magical beast. After all, this was the equivalent to an average person meeting a ghost for the first time; anyone would feel fear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, trailing behind them was the dainty Liang Xiao Le, who was empty handed. She looked around herself carefully due to her own weapon being long gone after she had been separated from her group and chased through the forest.Tie Ta lifted his battleaxe; his clothes were already swapped out. This time, he was wearing Blue Wolf leather along with some grassroot to hold it together. His academy uniform was long since torn apart from yesterday\u2019s battle to the point where he couldn\u2019t wear it anymore.In the blink of an eye, another day came and went. By looking at the profits, they weren\u2019t as good as the first day, but they weren\u2019t bad either. In total, they had killed 70 magical beasts, making Liang Xiao Le feel shocked.On this second day, Liang Xiao Le went through a major change. Ever since the spectacle with the Blue Wolves, her entire personality had transformed. At the very least, whenever she saw a magical beast, she wouldn\u2019t scream in terror anymore. And whenever Tie Ta and Jian Chen would slaughter any enemy magical beast, she didn\u2019t even flinch at the sight of the blood. She was slowly starting to adapt to her situation..Not only that, but in the same day, she had unexpectedly learned much about the dangers of the forest and gained knowledge pertaining to them. Her capacity for learning was extremely high, and even Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but admire it. Of course, what was important was looking at her talent for cultivation, since in the Tian Yuan continent, one\u2019s own strength was what dictated who they were over everything else.Liang Xiao Le was also extraordinarily smart. Although she wasn\u2019t very strong, she definitely didn\u2019t cause trouble for Tie Ta or Jian Chen, nor was she a burden like the two had previously thought she would be. She would stay behind the two, and whenever the two fought against a magical beast, she would stand far away so that she wouldn\u2019t get caught up in it.After that day, both Jian Chen or Tie Ta had a new levels of respect for Liang Xiao Le, and no longer belittled her in their hearts.Later that night, the three of them sat by the campfire to count the pile of monster cores.\u201cDear seniors, have you two really not condensed your Saint Weapons and become Saints yet?\u201d Liang Xiao Le asked as she stared at them with her bright eyes. What a strange question. Her clothes were already filled with holes from the trees and thorns that stabbed and cut into her, and her pretty face resembled a kitty from the whisker like cuts. Since there were no water sources, she had to rely on drinking the blood of the magical beasts in order to stave off the thirst, and so there was no way she could wash off the filth on her face.\u201cIf we were Saints, why would I be using this axe?\u201d Tie Ta looked at his bundled up and heavily nicked battleaxe with no small amount of dissatisfaction.After continued usage with Tie Ta\u2019s strength, the giant battleaxe had finally worn out; the previously sharp edge was now becoming blunt after use. Even the previously sharp point on Jian Chen\u2019s corroded iron rod had nearly become flat.Liang Xiao Le\u2019s face was full of admiration as she stared at the two, \u201cYou two are really amazing; you\u2019re not even at the Saint level yet and you can easily kill Class 1 Magical Beasts. In my opinion, once you reach the Saint level, you will be able to kill Class 2 Magical Beasts with ease.\u201dJian Chen shook his head, \u201cHow would it be easy? These are magical beasts that were bred by the academy, so they have weak attack power. When we meet magical beasts with a stronger attack, then we will definitely have a harder time with it.\u201dLiang Xiao Le nodded her head and said grimly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve heard my dad say before that there are some amazing Class 1 Magical Beasts that can spit out some low level spells with a high amount of attack power. They\u2019re so strong, that some normal Saints aren\u2019t powerful enough to beat them.\u201dJian Chen looked at Tie Ta, who was focusing on the campfire, \u201cTie Ta, right now there isn\u2019t anything in the 2nd region that could stand a chance against us, so I want to move to the 3rd region. How do you feel about that?\u201dTie Ta gave it some thought before saying, \u201cRight, the 2nd region is already very easy for us since there isn\u2019t a challenge anymore. Okay then, Changyang Xiang Tian, I\u2019ll enter the 3rd region with you. It\u2019s time to see how strong the Class 2 Magical Beasts really are.\u201dHearing the two talk, Liang Xiao Le who was sitting nearby said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be, you two haven\u2019t reached the Saint level and you still want to enter the 3rd region to fight Class 2 Magical Beasts? Without a Saint Weapon, there\u2019s no guarantee of survival, and the skin of a Class 2 Magical Beast is stronger than that of Class 1 Magical Beasts, so it\u2019s even tougher. You two only have a worn battleaxe and corroded iron rod, so that\u2019ll make killing even harder. Not only that, but the environment in the 3rd region isn\u2019t good at all; I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s even a marsh filled with poisonous vipers inside. There\u2019s a high chance you of losing your lives in the dangerous 3rd region.\u201dTie Ta laughed as he looked at my weapon, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Changyang Xiang Tian, over these past 2 days, our weapons have been in constant use, and my battleaxe has lost its sharpness. Even your own iron rod is almost flat, so it would be hard to kill Class 2 Magical Beasts.\u201dJian Chen laughed, \u201cThere\u2019s no rush, there are still plenty of students in the 2nd region. We still haven\u2019t met with other students because we\u2019re still far away from them. We should return tomorrow, and exchange monster cores for weapons, since the students would be definitely interested.\u201d\u201cYea, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Tie Ta nodded in agreement.Jian Chen continued, \u201cLiang Xiao Le, let\u2019s split up tomorrow. If you\u2019re with other students, then you should be able to safely pass through your last day. After all, anyone who has been able to endure 2 days here must have some real skills.\u201dLiang Xiao Le nodded wordlessly. Her expression was a bit disappointed; after all, she also knew of the 3rd region\u2019s dangers. She was unsure if Jian Chen and Tie Ta would be able to go against those magical beasts. If she continued along with them, even if Jian Chen and Tie Ta agreed to let her accompany them, she would only be a baggage that would hold them down.The night passed without incident. Soon, the sky began to brighten. Jian Chen and Tie Ta finished their night of cultivation, and began to prepare breakfast.After the three of them had finished eating, the sun had already gradually began to rise into the sky. They continued on their way; however, this time, they had begun walking back in the direction they had come from.After two days of battles, the two boys had already become extremely skilled at sensing and avoiding danger, so it didn\u2019t take long for them to arrive at their destination.Under a large tree, nine students in tattered clothing were tiredly sitting underneath, catching their breaths. They were a group of commoners mixed with some nobles. At the moment, their clothes were ripped all over the place, with some dried out bloodstains covering them as well. They also sported injuries on their bodies, and not far from them was a carcass of a magical beast lying on the ground.\u201cEveryone, hold on for just a bit longer. This is already the last day. After this day ends, we can leave,\u201d a commoner student breathlessly said.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we don\u2019t have enough Magic Stones yet, we still need five more. It looks like we still have to slaughter five more magical beasts to pass.\u201d said a young noble. Originally, the nobles hadn\u2019t been willing to stay together with the commoners, but after encountering the savage magical beast, they were immediately scared out of their wits. Faced with life or death, who would care about people\u2019s statuses? Protecting oneself was the greater priority. Thus, the few nobles had gradually decided to join the commoner students. After all, everyone knew there was strength in numbers. In addition, perhaps because the commoners had been raised in harsher environments, they did not show any signs of retreating when faced with savage magical beasts. This changed the arrogant nobles\u2019 views of the commoners. Eventually, they had all slowly become friends.Moreover, after constantly fighting against magical beasts, the nine of them had become more comfortable working together. Eventually, they had formed an unexpected bond that held all of them together with close relationships.At that moment, there was a movement in the grass off in the distance.\u201cEveryone, be careful. A magical beast is attacking.\u201d A student immediately reacted and loudly warned the others. Instantly, the nine of them stood up and stared with wary expressions towards the direction the sound had come from.The grass swayed vigorously. Eventually, they saw a figure wearing beast leather swinging a large hatchet around, cutting down the weeds in his way. Right after the group noticed him, they saw that there were two other figures following behind him as well. Although their clothes were tattered, it was obvious that they were all wearing the Kargath Academy uniforms.Perhaps because they had been traveling through the lush forest for so long, but their faces were dark, and they had random twigs in their hair. Only their general facial structures could be seen; their appearances were already indistinguishable.Realizing that the figures were people and not magical beasts, the nine students immediately sighed in relief, and smiles slowly spread across their faces. At this point, if they could get those new people to join them, then the overall strength of their group would definitely rise. Hunting magical beasts would be much easier. In addition, all of them were smart enough to realize that these people who had stayed here for 3 days must be quite powerful.Of course, these three people were Jian Chen, Tie Ta, and Liang Xiao Le. After backtracking for half a day, they had finally discovered a group of people.Since it was already the last of the three days, there weren\u2019t many people remaining in the forest. Most of them had already ran away, and so there were very few students that were still here.When Liang Xiao Le\u2019s gaze rested on a gorgeous girl standing amongst the group of nine, she showed a pleasantly surprised expression.\u201cAh! Li Sha!\u201d Liang Xiao Le shouted out with an extremely excited voice, as she immediately flew towards the gorgeous girl.Hearing a slightly familiar voice, the girl blinked her large, shining eyes, and gazed at Liang Xiao Le, who was running towards her, in slight confusion. Currently, Liang Xiao Le\u2019s face was covered with quite a bit of dirt, making her look like a calico cat. Even if this girl called Li Sha did know Liang Xiao Le well, it was difficult for her to recognize Liang Xiao Le with her current appearance.Liang Xiao Le rushed to the girl, and excitedly hugged her tightly. In a tone filled with joy, she said, \u201cLi Sha, I hadn\u2019t imagined that I would\u2019ve been able to see you again here. I thought you had already left the forest.\u201dHearing the overly familiar voice, the girl named Li Sha finally recognized who Liang Xiao Le was. Pleasantly surprised, she said, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re Xiao Le.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Xiao Le,\u201d Liang Xiao Le spoke, her voice dripping with emotion as she confirmed her friend\u2019s words.\u201cXiao Le, it really is you, that\u2019s great! I thought that you had already escaped from this place, I never would\u2019ve imagined that I would see you here.\u201d Li Sha, the girl in front of Liang Xiao Le, was just as happy, and continued to hug her once-thought-to-be-lost friend.The two girls joined in a tight embrace, Li Sha was laughing out loud\u201cLiang Xiao Le, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to meet again after losing each other in the forest This really makes me happy!\u201d\u201cHello,\u201d said a youth wearing clothing as tattered as the other two.\u201c I\u2019m so glad to have met the two of you here. Um\u2026 How should I put this? I\u2019m not sure if you want, but would you be willing to join our group? If you do, I can certainly guarantee that together our group will be much stronger and consequently will make hunting magical beasts a lot easier. And besides, danger lurks around every corner in these woods, it\u2019d be better if we worked together.\u201d His tone was first likeable as he walked up to Jian Chen and Tie Ta, but as soon as he saw that Jian Chen\u2019s clothes were entirely crimson with fresh blood, he couldn\u2019t help but express shock. The youth seriously doubted that the blood was all from Jian Chen, because anyone who lost that much blood would definitely be beyond weak. There was no way such a person could firmly stand there, with such a sharp look.Jian Chen shook his head, politely refusing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we were just planning to leave this place, so we cannot join your group.\u201dThe youth had an expression of regret on his face; however, he still reconciled, \u201cMy two fellow students, although the magical beasts here are quite formidable, we have strength in numbers. As long as everyone is willing to work together, even if we meet two magical beasts at once, they definitely won\u2019t pose any threat. If everyone hands over two Class 1 Magic Stones, I believe that we will soon gather enough.\u201d The youth continued to press the issue. His gaze was quite sharp, and it was obvious that he had already realized that Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s strengths were above average.\u201cWe really do not have any other options. The two of us have already decided to leave here, so we cannot join your group. Please forgive us.\u201d In order to reciprocate the formal request, Jian Chen\u2019s tone was just as amiable.Hearing that Jian Chen and Tie Ta were set on leaving, the youth could not help but be disappointed. He really could not understand why, although only one out of the three days was remaining, the two people refused to stay. As long as they paid up two Class 1 Magic Stones, they\u2019d be able to successfully join. Yet, Jian Chen and Tie Ta still chose to leave the area. Could it be that the two of them really wanted to pass up such an opportunity?The youth thought that Jian Chen and Tie Ta had given up and wanted to leave the forest. He couldn\u2019t have ever imagined that their \u201cleaving\u201d actually meant leaving the second region to enter the third region, not actually leaving the forest.At that moment, Tie Ta glanced at the battleaxe that one of the students was holding. His eyes lit up in happiness, and he directly walked over to the student with an intrepid air, and asked in a muffled voice, \u201cHey, if I give you two Class 1 Magic Stones, will you trade your battleaxe for them?\u201d Asking this, Tie Ta pulled out the battleaxe on his back with one hand, and used his other hand to retrieve from his Space Belt, two Class 1 Magic Stones that were still covered in fresh blood.It was at that moment that the group of people realized that the large battleaxe in Tie Ta\u2019s hands was covered in fresh blood. The entire surface had been dyed crimson. The appearance alone was beyond shocking; it looked as if was a murder weapon that had been constantly doused by blood. What was even more disbelieving was that the battleaxe made of firm metal as hard as steel, had already been completely riddled with cracks. Moreover, some parts of the blade were even bent.Most people would not be able to believe this sight; they had all assumed that when Tie Ta had chosen his weapon, it had been like this from the beginning. There was no way they could\u2019ve imagined that all of the axe\u2019s damages had been caused by Tie Ta himself.The student with the intrepid air looked at the beaten up axe in front of him, which was so red that it looked like it had been made from blood, and was at a loss for a moment. When the other students heard Tie Ta\u2019s request, their eyes immediately lit up, and looked at the intrepid student with looks of envy, as if they were about to offer up their own weapons to trade with Tie Ta.\u201cMy fellow student, I can exchange this sword of mine with you.\u201d A student carrying a giant one-handed sword walked over to Tia Ta and said with a smile.Hearing, Tie Ta looked down at the battleaxe that was in his grip, shook his head and spoke, \u201cNo need, I still prefer to use the battleaxe.\u201dHearing this, the male suddenly had a face full of disappointment. At this moment, getting two Class 1 Magics Stones was more important than anything else. Not to mention him, if the others could, they would also be willing to trade their weapons to Tie Ta for two Class 1 Magic Stones. Even if their weapons were worth more than two Class 1 Magic Stones, they would still not hesitate.The tall and sturdy male was not dumb. After considering it for a bit, he happily handed over his battleaxe to fulfill the exchange. Who would be willing to refuse such a profitable exchange?After the exchange was completed, the group of people began to look at Tie Ta with a different light. A few of the smarter students had already connected the battleaxe\u2019s battered state to the possibility that Tie Ta had caused it. From this point, they could directly confirm Tie Ta\u2019s extraordinary strength. Otherwise, why else would he just casually hand over two Class 1 Magic Stones? This place wasn\u2019t like outside; before entering the forest, the school administration had already confiscated any devices the students had. They had even patted the student\u2019s bodies down to thoroughly check. There was absolutely no way the Magic Stone could\u2019ve been brought in from the outside. The only way that Magic Stones could be gained inside the forest was to hunt magical beasts.However, there was just one thing the people couldn\u2019t understand. If Tie Ta and Jian Chen had the strengths to hunt magical beasts, why didn\u2019t they want to stay in the forest for all 3 days? After all, the academy\u2019s rules clearly dictated that they could only pass if they stayed for 3 days and paid up two Class 1 Magic Stones. If only one was fulfilled, they wouldn\u2019t pass.\u201cCould it be that they don\u2019t care about the rewards? Or perhaps they had lied about leaving, and actually just didn\u2019t want to kill magical beasts together with the few of us?\u201d Everyone could not help but think of these possibilities. When considering these thoughts, a few of the people immediately began to gaze at Jian Chen and Tie Ta with expressions of discontent.Jian Chen did not pay any mind to their expressions. He looked at the Liang Xiao Le and the girl she was hugging, and said, \u201cLiang Xiao Le, since you\u2019ve found your friend now, why don\u2019t you just stick with this group? They have more people too.\u201dLiang Xiao Le slowly separated from the girl, and looked back at Jian Chen and Tie Ta. She nodded, \u201cThen you two have to be careful.\u201dAfterwards, Tie Ta and Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother wasting any time, and immediately left the area.After the two of them had left, the girl called Li Sha asked in a resentful tone, \u201cXiao Le, who are they? They\u2019re so arrogant that they don\u2019t even think they should be with us.\u201d\u201cLi Sha, you\u2019re mistaken. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to be together with you guys; they really do want to leave here.\u201d Liang Xiao Le explained.\u201cThat can\u2019t be!\u201d Li Sha exclaimed in disbelief. \u201cLi Sha, the fact that they could casually give away a Class 1 Magic Stone means that the two of them have the strength to kill magical beasts. Plus, when they were trading the two magical stones away for the weapon, it was obvious that they were planning on continuing to fight. How could they possible be leaving this place?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Xiao Le, you\u2019ve been tricked by them.\u201d A youth standing on the side added.Liang Xiao Le smiled, \u201cThey\u2019re definitely leaving this place, but they didn\u2019t explain it clearly to you guys. They want to leave the second region, and move on to the third region to hunt the Class 2 Magical Beasts.\u201d\u201cWhat! Liang Xiao Le, what kind of joke are you trying to pull? It\u2019s impossible for the two of them to go to the third region to hunt Class 2 Magical Beasts!\u201d\u201cCould it be that their strengths have already reached Saint level? But that can\u2019t be right either. If they had reached the Saint level, then there would be no need to change weapons.\u201d\u201cThose two are really reckless, to want to go to the third region.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re definitely seeking death.\u201d\u2026\u2026Immediately following Liang Xiao Le\u2019s words, the group of people immediately broke into chaos as they began to discuss in a frenzy amongst each other. None of them thought that Jian Chen and Tie Ta would be able to survive the third region.Li Sha pulled at Liang Xiao Le\u2019s hands, and in a clearly disbelieving tone, she asked, \u201cXiao Le, they aren\u2019t really crazy enough to run over to the third region, right?\u201dLiang Xiao Le nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, they really did go to the third region. Li Sha, you cannot underestimate the two of them, they\u2019re really formidable.\u201d Liang Xiao Le said with conviction.\u201cCould it be that the two of them really are Saints?\u201d Li Sha asked in shock. The school administration had clearly declared that all students that were Saints had to enter the third region. There was no way they could\u2019ve appeared in the second region.Liang Xiao Le shook her head, \u201cNo, their powers haven\u2019t reached Saint level yet, because they still haven\u2019t condensed their Saint Weapons.\u201dHearing this, Li Sha\u2019s shock grew even more pronounced. Without reaching Saint level, surviving in the second region was already difficult enough, let alone being in the third region. After all, the magical beasts in the third region were Class 2 Magical Beasts, which weren\u2019t any small amount stronger than Class 1 Magical Beasts. The two classes could not even be compared.Li Sha and Liang Xiao Le were close friends. Therefore, Liang Xiao Le didn\u2019t feel the need to hide anything from Li Sha. In a soft voice, she said, \u201cLi Sha, I\u2019ll just tell you this. Yesterday, I personally witnessed the two of them kill 70+ magical beasts by themselves.\u201dLi Sha was beyond shocked by this, as she exclaimed, \u201cWhat! Xiao Le, are you joking? The two of them killed 70+ magical beasts by themselves in one day?\u201d Li Sha was so astonished that she couldn\u2019t contain her voice. She had gradually become louder and louder, until the other 8 people were able to hear her quite clearly. In that instant, all of their expressions changed at the thought of Jian Chen and Tie Ta achieving what Liang Xiao Le had said, and their expressions were beyond disbelief.\u201cLi Sha, what did you say? Which two people were able to kill 70+ Class 1 Magical Beasts in a day?\u201d A youth asked. He could not accept the possibility that \u201cthe two people\u201d were actually Jian Chen and Tie Ta, whom they had just met.Li Sha tried to calm her breathing, and grasped at her chest before pointing to Liang Xiao Le. In a trembling voice, she said, \u201cXiao Le said that she personally witnessed the two people just now kill 70+ magical beasts in one day.\u201d Li Sha\u2019s tone reflected the fact that she thought such a possibility was inconceivable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those two aren\u2019t even Saints yet; to think they could kill over 70 Magical Beasts in a day? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d A youth with a pike said incredulously.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s too ridiculous. Even a Saint wouldn\u2019t cut it; I think even a Great Saint wouldn\u2019t be able to kill that many Class 1 Magical Beasts in a single day, let alone half. I doubt their Saint Force is that unlimited.\u201d A bow wielding girl said with doubt.At that moment, the youth that had invited Jian Chen and Tie Ta into the group said, \u201cLiang Xiao Le, do you know who they are? When did our Kargath Academy have such amazing people in it? They aren\u2019t Saints, but to easily defeat Class 1 Magical Beasts? Just who are they?\u201d Saying this, he seemed to have immediately realized something, as his face rapidly changed colors.Liang Xiao Le\u2019s face looked proud as if she had done something honorable. With a laidback tone, she said, \u201cI can tell you this: the one that just traded you a monster core for your battleaxe was the one that set the academy abuzz\u2013Tie Ta: the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. The other person is the Freshmen Ruler of the annual Freshmen Competition\u2013Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dEveryone cried out in alarm before talking amongst themselves in excitement.\u201cSo it was those two abnormal people; no wonder their strength was that strong.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be, it\u2019s said that Tie Ta fought Lord Cheng to a standstill at the library\u2026\u201d\u201cThat Changyang Xiang Tian was the one who beat the Saint Ka Di Yun in an intense duel. I was there watching the fight; Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s strength was really amazing.\u201d\u201cI heard that outside the library, the middle ranked Saint Luo Jian wasn\u2019t able to deal with Changyang Xiang Tian, and was even forced to use his Saint Weapon in the end.\u201d\u2026\u2026Without the burden of having Liang Xiao Le anymore, Tie Ta and Jian Chen\u2019s speed had risen exponentially, and so the two soon reached the third region.When they first entered the 3rd region, they initially saw no difference in the two regions. But the further they advanced, the more hellish it became. Compared to the 3rd region, the 2nd region could be called a paradise.There were all sorts of magical beasts in the forest, and the land was full of swamps, so if one wasn\u2019t careful, they would find themselves stuck deep inside the waters. However, most of the swamps were man-made, so they weren\u2019t too deep. Otherwise, if no one came to rescue them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape with their lives.Perhaps it was because of the ground, but there wasn\u2019t much grass in the 3rd region, so line of sight was much better than the 2nd region.Jian Chen and Tie Ta cautiously trekked through the swamplands with a small amount of powder on them. This type of powder was a type of repellant that would prevent insects from biting them.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, it seems like you\u2019re familiar with the forest. Could it be you\u2019ve been here before? How could you be this amazing?\u201d Tie Ta said, while looking at the layer of green dust on his body.Jian Chen chuckled and said, \u201cI read up a lot of books in the library about various places, so my understanding of the forests is relatively high.\u201d\u201cAh, no wonder.\u201d Tie Ta realized.Right after Tie Ta spoke, Jian Chen\u2019s face stilled before becoming serious. At the same time, the ground began to shake, as if an earthquake was occurring.But before Jian Chen could say anything, Tie Ta had already sprung into action, his new battleaxe coming to rest in both his hands.Jian Chen glanced towards his left and spoke cautiously, \u201cTie Ta, be careful. This time it looks like we\u2019ve come across a large magical beast.\u201d\u201cYea!\u201d Tie Ta nodded his head as the expression on his face grew solemn. Because they were in the 3rd region, this wasn\u2019t a Class 1 magical beast, but a Class 2 Magical Beast that was stronger than a Class 1 Magical Beast by many times over. It could fight against a Great Saint on even footing.Although its attack power wasn\u2019t all that strong yet, its strength still couldn\u2019t be underestimated.As the two of them nervously looked around, the magical beast finally came into view. Its entire body had red fur, and it spanned 3 meters tall and 5 meters wide. Protruding from its mouth, it had two long tusks, that looked as if they could penetrate through muscle with ease. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the magical beast had a short nose, then Jian Chen would had thought that this was an animal that he had met in his previous world\u2013the elephant. But this magical beast was a lot bigger than the elephant.\u201cTie Ta, be careful, this is the Class 2 Magical Beast\u2013the Flaming Cloud Beast. It can spit out fire from its mouth and is quite hard to deal with.\u201d Jian Chen uttered the magical beast\u2019s name. Because he had read so many books in the library, he could recognize most magical beasts, and even knew of some of their special abilities.Tie Ta only nodded, as he wordlessly focused all of his attention on the Flaming Cloud Beast, ready to strike at any moment.\u201cHou!\u201d The gigantic Flaming Cloud Beast roared as it started to move each of its four hooves towards Jian Chen and Tie Ta. With each stamp on the ground, the earth would to shake.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed in concentration, \u201cI\u2019ll attack it from the front; Tie Ta, you go around and attack it from behind.\u201d Charging forward, he jumped into the air straight towards the Flaming Cloud Beast\u2019s head.The moment Jian Chen had moved, Tie Ta started to move as well, and circled around the beast to come towards its behind.Standing on top of its head, Jian Chen let out a yell as his Saint Force gathered within his iron rod, before fiercely stabbing it into the head of the beast.\u201cDing!\u201d As if made of steel, the head of the Flaming Cloud Beast deflected Jian Chen\u2019s iron rod. It had only left a shallow line on its head, unable to penetrate through its defense.Jian Chen\u2019s face changed into a grimace; although he knew the Flaming Cloud Beast had a strong defense, he hadn\u2019t thought that it would be so strong that his iron rod could do no damage to it. He had used all of his strength in that attack, and it had unexpectedly done virtually nothing.\u201cAhe!\u201d With a roar, Tie Ta jumped forward and used his enormous strength to slash at the butt of the Flaming Cloud Beast with his battleaxe. However he didn\u2019t do any better than Jian Chen. Although his battleaxe had cut through the skin of the magical beast, it had done no damage at all.Their attacks had evidently angered the Flaming Cloud Beast, because it roared in response. Whipping its head back and forth, it threw off Jian Chen, who had been standing on its head.As Jian Chen flew through the air, he quickly readjusted himself. Using both of his feet to jump off a tree trunk, he flipped himself upright onto a nearby tree branch.After throwing off Jian Chen, the Flaming Cloud Beast turned around and tried to bite into Tie Ta.Tie Ta immediately leapt aside to avoid its mouth, and simultaneously swung his battleaxe into one of the giant tusks.\u201cDing!\u201d The battleaxe smashed against the tusk, breaking it off near the root. However, after the tusk was broken off, Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe chipped off in several places as well.\u201cHou!\u201d The Flaming Cloud Beast roared in anger as it stampeded towards Tie Ta once more.Tie Ta\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously as it watched the Flaming Cloud Beast charge towards him. Without bothering to dodge, Tie Ta dropped his battleaxe onto the ground and used both of his hands to grab onto the remaining tusk and the root of the broken one, before pushing back at the monster, resulting in a deadlock.At that moment, it was as if Tie Ta had turned into a fierce beast. Grunting out loud, his hands pushed against the Flaming Cloud Beast\u2019s tusks, as if trying to compare his strength to it.Despite Tie Ta\u2019s heavenly strength, he was still a delicate tiny figure compared to the heavy and gigantic Flaming Cloud Beast. So even though his own strength wasn\u2019t lacking, he found himself being pushed backwards a large distance, his feet leaving behind two deep marks in the ground .\u201cAh!\u201d Tie Ta\u2019s eyes revealed a crazy look within them as he roared. The veins within his arms bulged as both of his arms swelled up in an instant, as he began to exert more force.\u201cPa!\u201d Another crisp sound was heard as the remaining tusk was snapped off by Tie Ta, causing the Flaming Cloud Beast to release a blood curling roar of pain.Despite having used a good amount of his strength, Tie Ta was not yet satisfied, as he grabbed onto the freshly broken off tusk and used it to pierce it into the head of the Flaming Cloud Beast.The tooth of the Flaming Cloud Beast was extraordinarily sharp, and was far stronger than Jian Chen\u2019s weapon. But despite its sharpness, it had only penetrated into the head by a tiny amount, causing a small amount of blood to spurt outwards.Seeing Tie Ta use its own tusk to stab it, the Flaming Cloud Beast\u2019s eyes grew extremely red as it opened its mouth wide. With a loud roar, it unleashed a trail of fire that moved around, almost like a serpent emerging from its gaping jaws, with the intention of roasting Tie Ta alive. Instantly, the surrounding temperature had started to increase exponentially.Sensing the astonishing heat radiate from the stream of fire, Tie Ta\u2019s expression immediately changed, as he desperately threw himself away from the attack. But despite his efforts he had not been able to dodge the attack of the fire serpent, and so his entire body caught on fire.Seeing Tie Ta\u2019s body catch on fire, Jian Chen turned pale with fright. Immediately snapping off a thick tree branch, he jumped off against a tree trunk and sped towards the Tie Ta like a speeding bullet.\u201cHou!\u201d The Flaming Cloud Beast roared once more as it stamped towards the still burning Tie Ta. Opening its jaws wide, it tried to swallow him, not caring if he was on fire or not.Just as the Flaming Cloud Beast was about to consume Tie Ta, Jian Chen had finally reached Tie Ta. Using both of his arms, Jian Chen waved the tree branch in his hand to drag Tie Ta a good 10 meters away from the jaws of the magical beast.Jian Chen quickly dislodged Tie Ta from the branch and without caring for the fire\u2019s heat, he quickly extended his arms and tore away at the wolf leather Tie Ta was wearing.Because the fire had caught onto the fur of the wolf leather, the moment it was removed from him, Tie Ta was no longer on fire. Tie Ta\u2019s tattered academy uniform was exposed underneath.Tie Ta didn\u2019t bother to get up from the floor, but instead started to roll on the ground while complaining, \u201cHot, hot! I\u2019m dying from the heat, it burns\u2026\u201d Seeing him complain like that, Jian Chen deduced that Tie Ta had not suffered any major harm. However, all of his hair had been burnt off, leaving him bald. Not a single hair remained; even his eyebrows and eyelashes had been burnt away!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He let out a long breath, and spoke in a muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019m fine, but the heat really got me; it was difficult to endure.\u201d\u201cAs long as you\u2019re fine.\u201d Jian Chen sighed in relief. When he saw that Tie Ta was engulfed in flames, Jian Chen had honestly felt quite concerned for Tie Ta\u2019s well-being.Suddenly, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes hardened as he turned back to look at the lush tree. His eyes gleamed as his mouth also rose up to show a hint of a smile.\u201cHong! Hong! Hong!\u201dThe ground began to shake again as the Flaming Cloud Beast stamped towards Jian Chen. With each step it took, the earth trembled. The Flaming Cloud Beast kept breathing fire out of its mouth, almost as if it was excited.Tie Ta\u2019s face hardened as he stared at the approaching Flaming Cloud Beast, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this guy\u2019s skin is fairly tough. How do we go about killing him?\u201dJian Chen also looked at the beast with a grave face, \u201cThe Flaming Cloud Beast\u2019s body is entirely covered by a strong layer of skin. Unless we reach the level of Saints, our weapons will barely be able to slice apart its pelt. At the moment, our only chance is to attack through the Flaming Cloud Beast\u2019s eyes to stab its brain.\u201dAs Jian Chen trailed off, the Flaming Cloud Beast roared, and opened up its jaws to release another serpent fire.Jian Chen and Tie Ta both dove towards the side to dodge it. Jian Chen tightly clenched the iron rod, as he cried out, \u201cTie Ta, distract it for me!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, leave it to me!\u201d Tie Ta picked up a nearby rock and threw it at the Flaming Cloud Beast, and ran towards the opposite direction.The rock twirled in midair before hitting the Flaming Cloud Beast precisely on the spot where Tie Ta had broke off the tusk.Since the spot was still tender for the Flaming Cloud Beast, its eyes turned red with bloodlust as it began to breath fire at Tie Ta once more.Jian Chen watched as Tie Ta distracted the Flaming Cloud Beast. He gripped the iron rod so hard that it had began to deform. Quickly running forward, he dashed towards the head of the Flaming Cloud Beast.Jian Chen\u2019s speed was fairly fast. As he dashed across the ground, the grass around him swayed from the rapid air currents, which made him seem like he was flying.In a short moment, Jian Chen had reached the head of the Flaming Cloud Beast. Not even caring for the intense heat from the streams of fire the beast was spitting out, he jumped into the air once more to land on the head of the beast. With the iron rod in his right hand, he quickly stabbed it into the eyes of the Flaming Cloud Beast.Although Jian Chen had moved quickly, the Flaming Cloud Beast wasn\u2019t slow to react either. Before the iron rod could pierce the eye, the beast suddenly shut its eyes.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed for just a brief second as he saw the Flaming Cloud Beast close its eyes. Focusing, Jian Chen condensed his soul and willed it to enter his iron rod. As it covered the sharp point of the iron rod, he tried to ram it into the eyelid of the Flaming Cloud Beast.The iron rod then pierced through the eyelid with no difficulty or resistance. Immediately, blood came pouring out of the eye of the Flaming Cloud Beast.\u201cHou!\u201d The Flaming Cloud Beast suddenly let loose a desolate cry that shook the heavens themselves, as it whirled and struck out randomly in all directions.Jian Chen exerted more pressure on his right arm, pushing the iron rod in even deeper in attempt to strike at the brain from the eyes.The Flaming Cloud Beast\u2019s screams became more desolate as it started to sway back and forth. It attempted to remove the iron rod from its eye, but the rod had already sunk in far too deep, making it difficult to remove. As it shook its head to remove Jian Chen, the pain grew more intense. After two attempts at shaking its head, the pain was so fierce for the Flaming Cloud Beast that it didn\u2019t dare to move at all anymore.Endlessly wailing in pain, the Flaming Cloud Beast dropped to the ground, where it began its final struggle to fight. Although the wound wasn\u2019t fatal, the damage done to its cranial nerves was excruciatingly hard to bear.Seeing the Flaming Cloud Beast fall to the ground, Jian Chen flashed in glee as he yelled \u201cTie Ta, quickly drive the iron rod deeper in.\u201d Given Tie Ta\u2019s heavenly strength, this task couldn\u2019t be more appropriate for anyone else.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Tie Ta cried out happily as he ran over, having now realized that victory was on hand.Tie Ta approached the Flaming Cloud Beast quickly and grabbed the iron rod before pushing it one meter deeper into the eye of the Flaming Cloud Beast with his right hand. Only a small portion of the rod was left sticking out.\u201cHou!\u201d The loudest cry yet came out of the beast, causing Tie Ta and Jian Chen\u2019s ears to momentarily go deaf. With that, the Flaming Cloud Beast expended the last of its energy and slumped onto the ground. It stopped twitching, and its other eye gradually closed.Seeing that the beast had finally died, Jian Chen and Tie Ta could not help but exhale in relief. The Class 2 Magical Beast Flaming Cloud Beast wasn\u2019t that amazing, but its defenses were extraordinarily high. Thus, killing it was an extremely difficult task.\u201cIt finally died; this magical beast was too troublesome. It even breathed out fire and burnt away all my hair.\u201d Tie Ta touched his bald head with a depressed expression.Jian Chen could only laugh as he watched Tie Ta gloom over his hair and clothes. \u201cYou should at the very least put something on!\u201d He said as he took out another wolf pelt from his Space Belt. The wolf pelts were something he and Tie Ta had prepared; there were many sets stored within their belts just in case they needed a new change of clothes. Because they were in a forest where battle was a common occurrence; a change of clothes could not be in high enough demand.Tie Ta took it without another word, and in a flash, he had transformed the pelt into wearable clothing.Afterwards, Jian Chen and Tie Ta extracted the Monster Core and continued on their way.After Jian Chen and Tie Ta disappeared from view, a red clad figure dropped down from the trees. The figure was a tall woman, around 30 years old, clad in fiery red clothing. Her appearance was not extremely beautiful, yet she gave off a gentle, calm air.The woman stared at the carcass of the Flaming Cloud Beast with astonishment written clearly on her face. Letting out a deep breath, the woman muttered to herself, \u201cTie Ta and Changyang Xiang Tian, you two truly have well deserved reputations. To think your strengths are this amazing; you two aren\u2019t even Saints yet and you managed to use regular iron weapons to kill a Class 2 Magical Beast known for its defenses. I am truly awestruck; I must report this to the headmaster.\u201d After saying that, the woman immediately vanished into thin air.As soon as the woman disappeared, another 5 youths came into the clearing. Each of the 5\u2019s faces were covered by darkness, so their appearances couldn\u2019t be easily seen. However, their shabby academy uniforms could be seen as they held their weapons up. Two held greatswords while another held up a large axe. The last youth with a tall and sturdy body held his sledgehammer up as he followed the group.\u201cJudging from the sound, the cry came from this area.\u201d One of the greatsword wielding youths said to the rest.The axe carrying student nodded his head, \u201cNot bad, if the magical beast didn\u2019t run too far away, then it should still be in the vicinity\u2026:\u201dHe trailed off as his eyes widened at the sight in front of him, \u201cYou guys, look! What is that\u2026\u201d He pointed.Hearing their friend, everyone\u2019s eyes drifted forward as they saw a mountain-like fiery red body lying on the ground that seemed to resemble a magical beast.\u201cLet\u2019s go look.\u201dIn a flash, all five of them approached the body of the magical beast. However, after they recognized the magical beast, their faces all grew serious.The most experienced one amongst them got close to the body and touched the bloody fur with one hand before saying, \u201cThis is a Flaming Cloud Beast. Its defenses are very high, but its attacks aren\u2019t all that strong. The blood hasn\u2019t dried yet and is still warm, so it must have just died. It would appear that the howl we heard earlier was from this.\u201dThe sword youth looked around himself before looking at the direction of Jian Chen\u2019s footprints. \u201cCome, let\u2019s go follow those footsteps and see who exactly killed this Flaming Cloud Beast. If their strength is good enough, we can add them to our group so we can easily hunt more beasts. But if they\u2019re weaker than us\u2026\u201dA small smile started to creep up on his face.Hearing this, the other 4 youths all thought of the same thing, their faces revealing evil smiles. Soon after, the 5 of them immediately chased after Tie Ta and Jian Chen.At the moment, Jian Chen and Tie Ta were cautiously walking within the forest. In order to protect themselves from magical beasts as well as a few of the swamps on the ground, the two of them were not advancing very quickly.At that moment, Jian Chen\u2019s ears detected something. Holding his hand up to stop Tie Ta, he said, \u201cBe careful, there\u2019s some people coming from behind us.\u201dTie Ta immediately stopped moving and turned around in curiosity.In the blink of an eye, the people who had been following Jian Chen came into view. There was a total of 5 people, but Jian Chen couldn\u2019t see their faces since it was covered by the shade, but he could tell that they were strong from the amount of Saint Force they were emitting from their weapons.When the 5 saw Jian Chen and Tie Ta, they let loose happy smiles to each other, as if they had mutually agreed on something. Increasing their speeds, the 5 of them quickly reached and surrounded Jian Chen and Tie Ta.Seeing this development, both Tie Ta and Jian Chen felt a bad premonition within themselves.\u201cDear students, might I ask what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Jian Chen asked.One of the youths brandished his sword with an evil smile, \u201cYou\u2019re asking us what we are doing?\u201d\u201cHand over your space belts obediently. We definitely don\u2019t want to embarrass you, but if you don\u2019t comply\u2026hahaha\u2026\u201d The sledgehammer wielding student sneered at them.Tie Ta\u2019s face grew angry as he heard the demand, \u201cYou want us to hand over the space belts? Hmph, don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d Tie Ta understood what was going on now; this was a roadside robbery.Jian Chen patted the space belt on him gently with a smile, \u201cThe space belts with all our monster cores are inside, if you have the skill, come and get it then.\u201dAlthough they knew that all 5 of them were Saints, neither Jian Chen nor Tie Ta felt a hint of fear.\u201cHmph, since it came down to this, then don\u2019t blame us for this. Everyone, attack together.\u201d Immediately the 5 of them rushed forward to attack the two, but their attacks were not aimed at fatal areas. The 5 clearly understood that they were still all students stealing was one thing, and so was fighting, but they were not allowed to fatally threaten the opposing party\u2019s lives.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Chaotic Sword GodCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: Counter StealJian Chen and Tie Ta immediately dove to the side. After two days of relentlessly fighting magical beasts, even the thick skulled Tie Ta had started to pick up battle experience. This paid off; as Tie Ta dodged the incoming attack, he instinctively swung his battleaxe at the leg of the assailant in a swift counterattack.However, the group in front of them was proving hard to deal with. Just as the battleaxe was about to hit one of them in the thigh, a sword flew out and hit the battleaxe with a colliding sound.\u201cDeng!\u201dMetal met metal, as Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe was obstructed. Due to Tie Ta\u2019s terrifying strength, the battleaxe continued to slide down the blade of the sword before stopping at the hilt. Immediately, the youth holding the sword suddenly felt his entire arm go numb, as the battleaxe smashed itself against his arm, causing his whole hand to shake.The youth was astonished and cried out to his friends, \u201cEveryone be careful, this guy\u2019s strength is abnormally strong. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t get into arm\u2019s reach of him!\u201dHearing the warning, the other two students fighting Tie Ta immediately became more cautious, and tried to avoid his giant battleaxe.On the side, Jian Chen was fighting intensely with the other youth holding a sword. Although Jian Chen\u2019s weapon was only a corroded iron rod, his fighting capabilities weren\u2019t any lower than Tie Ta\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t any weaker either since he could easily use his agility to move around his opponent\u2019s moves. Seeing an opening, Jian Chen quickly stabbed his iron rod into the opponent\u2019s thigh with a lightning fast speed. Since this was another student at the academy, he didn\u2019t dare to aim to kill, but instead aimed to injure.Jian Chen\u2019s speed was so fast that the student didn\u2019t have time to react, and could only watch in shock as the iron rod stabbed into his thigh.\u201cAh!\u201d The youth cried out in pain as his face drained of color, and sweat dripped down his forehead.Hearing his companion cry out, the other sword wielder\u2019s face changed. Unable to fight Jian Chen personally, he cried out to his friend, \u201cHarry, are you okay?\u201dAlthough that youth wasn\u2019t attacking Jian Chen anymore, Jian Chen wasn\u2019t going to let him off that easily. As Jian Chen moved towards him, the Saint Force condensed into Jian Chen\u2019s fist as he suddenly punched the youth in the chest.Still moving at fast speeds, he refused to listen to the youth\u2019s complaints, or even wait for the youth to react. Jian Chen\u2019s palm struck out silently like a viper, and hit the other squarely on the chest.\u201cPeng!\u201d The youth was sent flying through the air from Jian Chen\u2019s fist, as blood came spurting out of his mouth.After dispatching the two, he immediately went to go assist Tie Ta. At the moment, Tie Ta was embroiled in a tough battle, and had already taken damage from the 3 people. The wolf pelt he was wearing had already been slashed apart and ruined by the blood that was leaking from his wounds. If it weren\u2019t for his extremely durable body and godly strength, the others would not have been afraid to fight against him and knock him to the ground.With the appearance of Jian Chen, Tie Ta\u2019s pressure was alleviated by quite a bit. Jian Chen\u2019s strength in battle was extremely strong, and even normal Saints wouldn\u2019t be able to fight him on equal footing. After a few seconds of close combat fighting against Jian Chen, the three that had surrounded Tie Ta had already started to lose. Each of them were sporting new injuries, and soon after, all 5 of them were writhing on the floor in pain, no longer having the energy to move.Jian Chen looked at the many wounds on Tie Ta, and asked with some concern, \u201cTie Ta, are you okay?\u201dTie Ta nodded his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, my body\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d He pointed to the group of 5 people writhing on the ground, \u201cWhat should we do with them?\u201dThinking about it, Jian Chen suddenly grew a strange smile on his face, \u201cTie Ta, go gather their Space Belts and take all of their monster cores before giving the belts back.\u201dHearing Jian Chen, the 5 people on the ground went rigid as their faces paled; a few of them were growing red with indignation. The cores in their Space Belts were earned over the span of 2 days of constant struggles for their lives; right now there was only half a day left until the 3rd day passed. If they were to lose all of their monster cores now, then they would definitely fail the mission.Tie Ta laughed. Without hesitation, he immediately followed Jian Chen\u2019s orders, and grabbed all 5 of the space belts from them. Jian Chen stared them down with the bloody iron rod in his hand, like a tiger watching his prey to prevent them from making any sudden movements.The five students originally had planned to fight back, but when they saw Jian Chen grip the bloody iron rod, they immediately gave up all thoughts about resisting, and obediently let Tie Ta take their space belts.After gathering all of the space belts, Tie Ta brought them back to Jian Chen and began to count the monster cores one by one. In total, they had only 12 monster cores, all of which were Class 2 Monster Cores.Jian Chen laughed as he grabbed 6 of the monster cores and put them in their own space belts before saying, \u201cTie Ta, let\u2019s split these in half, you get 6, I get 6.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Tie Ta said as he placed his share into his own space belt.But when the 5 heard Tie Ta\u2019s name, all 5 of them went still, as their faces became unsightly to look at. When it came to his name, everyone in Kargath Academy had heard of him since he was the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. Although he wasn\u2019t a Saint, when it came to the entire school, no one dared to mess with him.By this point, the 5 students started to regret their actions so much that their intestines became green. If they had known earlier that one of them was Tie Ta, then they wouldn\u2019t have tried to steal from the headmaster\u2019s apprentice no matter what. But now, not only were they robbed of what they were trying to steal, but they couldn\u2019t even get revenge now that they knew who he was; their sufferings couldn\u2019t be summed up in words.TL Note: Intestines go green after the body dies. Basically they regret their actions so much they want to die.After storing all of the Class 2 Monster Cores, Tie Ta was smiling even brighter. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, it\u2019s because you\u2019re so amazing and beat all 5 of them so quickly. I, Tie Ta, just can\u2019t compare to you at all.\u201dJian Chen laughed and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get back on the road now and hope we can kill a few more magical beasts for the sake of our cultivation,\u201dSoon after, Jian Chen and Tie Ta didn\u2019t see the paralyzed looks of the 5 students on the floor as they walked away.When the two disappeared into the forest, one of the youths started to curse out loud, \u201cF*cking hell, what bad luck we have! To think we came across the apprentice of the headmaster and then failed the assignment. Not only that, but we had our monster cores stolen away from us without us being able to get revenge. Such wretched luck!\u201dThe youth who had carried the sledge hammer earlier said in a hoarse voice, \u201cThat\u2019s not all of it, don\u2019t forget that it wasn\u2019t just Tie Ta who attacked us; there was another.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dThe sledgehammer student nodded his head, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Tie Ta has the support of the headmaster, so we can\u2019t get revenge on him. But Changyang Xiang Tian doesn\u2019t have that same support.\u201d\u201cBut Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s strength is so strong though. The 5 of us couldn\u2019t beat him while he was alone, how would we ever beat him?\u201d Another person asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, and the most important fact was that Changyang Xiang Tian was far too fast, we couldn\u2019t even dodge any of his attacks.\u201d One of the sword wielders said; it was the very same person who had his thigh pierced by Jian Chen.Then, the person with the axe opened his mouth suddenly, \u201cYou guys forget that Changyang Xiang Tian already offended a lot of people at the academy like Lord Cheng and Master Luo, whose strength is higher than ours. If we can find an opportunity to join them, sooner or later we\u2019ll find a chance to strike at him.\u201d\u2026\u2026..In the blink of an eye, the colors of the sky began to dim. The magical beasts in the 3rd region were far less abundant than the ones in the 2nd region.Half a day had passed, but Jian Chen and Tie Ta had only found a few magical beasts. Everytime they encountered one, they experienced an arduous battle to kill it. Within that afternoon, the two of them had only gained another 7 Class 2 Monster Cores. Compared to their bounty in the 2nd region, this number was clearly insignificant. But when they thought about how the 5 students who attacked them earlier had only gained 12 Class 2 Monster Cores in 2 days despite being Saints, their hearts felt a bit more relieved.It was a lot more restless in the 3rd region than the 2nd, since the monsters were a lot harder to kill. Also, since the number of monsters were less, more people were willing to rob others for their cores. After Jian Chen and Tie Ta had fought against the 5 students from before, they had another 3 encounters with robbers. At the very least each group had 4 people in it and at the most a group had 7 of them. But in the end, they had overcome each challenge victorious, and took all of the monster cores from the other groups. But what had made Jian Chen depressed was that the group of 4 that attacked them earlier didn\u2019t have a single monster core, but the other 2 groups had a total of 33 Class 2 Monster Cores in the end.When night came, Jian Chen and Tie Ta sat down next to the fire as they roasted the meat of a magical beast. The two looked exhausted; compared to the 2nd region, the 3rd region was far more tiring.At this point, Tie Ta\u2019s academy uniform was essentially gone. On his chest, his gains were showing. Only the most important part of his body was covered up by one of the extra wolf pelts, making him look like a savage. He was already covered with scars all over, and although they looked painful, they were only superficial wounds that didn\u2019t affect Tie Ta at all. This was a strong body that even Jian Chen looked at with jealousy.Jian Chen, on the other hand, was not faring much better. Although he still stuck with wearing his academy uniform, it had already been dyed red from blood, staining the clothes black after oxidizing.Suddenly, Jian Chen could hear the sounds of a distant battle. With his acute ears, he could heard the faintest of sounds.Jian Chen stood up from where he was sitting, and looked off to where he heard the sounds, \u201cTie Ta, there\u2019s a fight going on over there.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In this environment, no matter what sound it was, Jian Chen was always on alert, especially since he had already been attacked by his fellow students multiple times earlier that day. Jian Chen had seen those older and more experienced students fall due to not always being on guard, Jian Chen didn\u2019t plan to end up like them.Straining his ears to hear the most minute of sounds, Jian Chen tried to catch the sounds he heard earlier. But as soon as he furrowed his eyebrows in thought, he heard the sound again. It wasn\u2019t the sound of a person fighting a magical beast, but of two people fighting each other. In addition, the sounds were getting closer.Jian Chen looked at Tie Ta and said, \u201cTie Ta, that\u2019s not the sound of a person fighting against a magical beast, but of two people fighting each other. The sounds are getting louder and louder, so you should prepare yourself; we might end up fighting.\u201d Jian Chen didn\u2019t choose to change locations. With their current strength, they could easily protect themselves. In addition, he wasn\u2019t afraid of anything.Tie Ta immediately became interested as he grabbed his battleaxe and asked, \u201cHow many people do you think are fighting? Changyang Xiang Tian, do you think we should take a look?\u201dJian Chen held the iron rod over the fire, \u201cNo need, even without our interference, they\u2019ll be approaching us soon enough.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Tie Ta sat back down after that with a look of serenity.Soon enough, the sounds of battle became louder and louder, to the point where even Tie Ta could hear it. A group of figures quickly came scurrying out from the bushes, and ran to where the bonfire was.Right behind them, a person wearing black flashed in, clearly chasing the other group.\u201cMy two friends, the group behind wants to steal our monster core. Not only are they strong, but their numbers are greater than ours, I hope that we can combine forces and fight them off; otherwise, the hard work we had painstakingly earned over the last 2 days will be taken by them.\u201d One person shouted from a distance. Although Jian Chen and Tie Ta were only 2 people, if they joined them then they would be able to fairly go against the opposite party.Hearing that voice, Jian Chen\u2019s eyebrows knitted together. He felt that this voice was very familiar to him, as if he had heard it before. However, he couldn\u2019t place a name on the voice; clearly it hadn\u2019t left much of an impression.The four people that were running away were getting closer and closer to Jian Chen now. The person chasing them from behind suddenly sped forward and blocked off the four from moving forward anymore. Holding his giant sword up, he swung his sword at the ones who were still running.The one leading the team fought back with his own Saint Weapon to block against the sword.\u201cDeng!\u201dThe two people had a huge difference in strength that could easily be seen, as the one who had blocked the attack was thrown backwards violently.With this distraction, the people chasing from behind had finally caught up and once more started to attack those who were trying to run away. There were 8 people that had come in pursuit, and all of them quite strong. The difference between their numbers only added to the pressure; without reinforcements, the ones who were trying to run away would ultimately lose.\u201cLuo Jian, just wait there, I won\u2019t let you get away.\u201d One of the ones who were running away snarled.Hearing this, Jian Chen who was standing not too far away went rigid. The voice who spoke out was one he was familiar with; it was his older brother Changyang Hu.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Jian Chen cried out in astonishment. Immediately his face became one of shock, and without hesitation, he rushed on over with his iron rod in hand.Seeing Jian Chen move, Tie Ta began follow Jian Chen with his battleaxe in hand. For the past 3 days, Tie Ta had started to follow all of Jian Chen\u2019s commands without even realizing it.Over the course of the 3 days, Jian Chen\u2019s strength had been fully revealed. With his experience of surviving in the forest and his strategy, Tie Ta had been humbled by Jian Chen\u2019s talents.Flying across the ground, Jian Chen ran across the grass towards where the fight was taking place. His hands blurred as the iron rod flew through the air and pierced into one of the people his brother was fighting. He was relieved to hear that one of the people coming towards him was his older brother, Changyang Hu.Although everyone had noticed Jian Chen and Tie Ta, and were all cautiously guarded against the two, Jian Chen had moved far too fast and without warning. In their limited lines of sight due to the darkness, no one had noticed to the iron rod in Jian Chen\u2019s hand.The pointed end of the iron rod stabbed into the Changyang Hu\u2019s attacker, causing him to scream out in pain into the night sky as he whirled around. Without waiting for the guy to react further, Jian Chen immediately brought his leg to his chest and kicked him away into the air.\u201cAgh!\u201d At this moment, Tie Ta also charged over. He swung his axe around, hacking away at the enemies, causing them to be batted away.But the person Tie Ta was swinging at wasn\u2019t slow to react either. Watching the axe come down on them, his face didn\u2019t reveal the smallest amount of fear, and instead, he brought his sword up to block the axe.\u201cDeng!\u201dOnce the sword met the battleaxe, Tie Ta and the other were brought to a deadlock with a loud clang. Their weapons shook; Tie Ta remained where he stood, while the other person was forcibly sent flying backwards.With Tie Ta\u2019s godly strength, unless one was a giant, then he/she would stand no chance against Tie Ta. But the person who was fighting against him was no giant, and so he had taken a huge loss.However, even with that development, Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe chipped once more. Although the difference in strength was huge, if Tie Ta had not enveloped his battleaxe with his own Saint Force, then the battleaxe would have long since been destroyed.\u201cAh!\u2019 Tie Ta let loose a snarl as he brandished his battleaxe. The group of robbers then dispatched another 2 people to face off against Tie Ta.\u201cDang!\u201d After his clear clang, another person who didn\u2019t understand how strong Tie Ta was collided against him one more time. Immediately, he was launched into the air by Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe, which caused his battleaxe to chip even more.Although Tie Ta\u2019s battleaxe was strong, it was far from being on the same level as a Saint Weapon, because every Saint Weapon had a great amount of energy within it. With a Saint Weapon, one could release an attack far stronger than normal blows. However, these people Jian Chen were fighting against were far too weak, and some of them were still at the primary levels of a Saint. While Tie Ta could go toe to toe with those primary leveled Saints, his battleaxe had been through far too many collisions.\u201cBe careful, his strength is extraordinarily high, and watch out for his battleaxe.\u201d The one who was blown away from him yelled as a warning.Hearing his companion\u2019s warning, the remaining youth became extremely cautious. He dodged the battleaxe, and grabbed onto Tie Ta\u2019s Space Belt\u2026Jian Chen was moving around with the speed of lightning. as his iron rod flashed this way and that. With his body moving like a spirit\u2019s, he fought alongside with Changyang Hu. Already dyed red with blood, the iron rod was concealed under the shade of the night, as if it was a viper. As he wandered about the area in the darkness, his iron rod shot out silently, in a silent manner that was difficult for his enemies to detect.Jian Chen was striking out with his iron rod so fast that even the person fighting Changyang Hu were not able to react in time, as his thighs were speared through with the iron rod.The person\u2019s face grimaced in pain as he let out a painful scream, and clenched his hands in reflex. Changyang Hu was not courteous enough to wait for him to simmer down, and immediately sliced at his opponent\u2019s left shoulder.Immediately, he cried out in pain again as his left arm was cut, the sword cutting the bone clean off, leaving his arm to be connected to his arm by a small amount of flesh. A torrent of blood came spurting out as he grabbed at it.A cyan colored light illuminated the night as they all saw a giant sword appear and slash down towards Jian Chen.\u201cWind attributed Saint Force!\u201d Seeing the cyan light envelop the sword, Jian Chen\u2019s own face hardened. He immediately used the Profound Steps and melted away into the air like a mirage. As soon as he had faded away, the cyan sword immediately slashed through at the spot where Jian Chen had just been standing.Jian Chen reappeared 3 meters away, not too far away. The person who had slashed at him stood arrogantly at the spot; wearing a raggedy academy uniform dyed red with blood, his face was covered by the night, so Jian Chen couldn\u2019t recognize him.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes focused on the group. He snorted and said in a low voice, \u201cLuo Jian, I didn\u2019t think I would meet you here.\u201dThe youth Jian Chen addressed was startled. He thought the voice was far too familiar, so he carefully stared at Jian Chen. Although it was nighttime, there was still a gleaming light in the sky that allowed him to see Jian Chen\u2019s face clearly.However, after 3 days of constant fighting in the forest, without any clear water, everyone\u2019s faces was jetblack. It was impossible for people to see each other\u2019s appearances with ease.However, the nearby Changyang Hu heard the voice of Jian Chen, and his face became one of shock; he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes or ears, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re fourth brother!\u201d Changyang Hu was astonished; when it came to Jian Chen\u2019s voice, he was all too familiar with it.Luo Jian suddenly came to a realization as he laughed, \u201cNo wonder I thought your voice was familiar. So it was Changyang Xiang Tian after all. I didn\u2019t think you would breakthrough to becoming a Saint; I really am amazed at that.\u201d After saying that, his eyes flashed dangerously.Jian Chen turned around and face Changyang Hu, \u201cBig brother, we\u2019ll talk later. Right now, I\u2019ll remove the crisis in front of us. You go help the others, and leave Luo Jian to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luo Jian\u2019s strength has already reached the middle ranked Saint level.\u201d Changyang Hu immediately went off to help his friends. Although seeing Jian Chen in the 3rd region was unexpected, he knew that now wasn\u2019t the time to try to figure out how or why.Because Jian Chen and Tie Ta\u2019s sudden appearance, the originally disadvantaged Changyang Hu and his group were now on an even playing field. Moreover, because of Tie Ta\u2019s existence, the winds of battle were blowing in their favor. The playing field was now sloped towards them in a short amount of time.Looking at the Luo Jian\u2019s dark and swarthy face, Jian Chen laughed, \u201cLuo Jian, it looks like your plan to steal our monster cores will end in failure, your monster cores will be given to us instead.\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s face grew angry as his eyes flashed dangerously, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you don\u2019t have the power to take away my monster cores.\u201dJian Chen looked at Luo Jian with some disdain before saying, \u201cThen let\u2019s test it out; let\u2019s see if I have the power to snatch away your monster cores or not.\u201d Jian Chen said nothing more after that, as his body started to sway before charging quickly at Luo Jian. His hand held the iron rod and struck like a viper towards Luo Jian\u2019s chest, using the darkness of the night as its cover.A flash of killing intent went through Luo Jian\u2019s eyes as he held his cyan colored sword up. He brandished it in an imposing manner before slashing at Jian Chen. Since Luo Jian was not only a middle ranked Saint, but also had wind attributed Saint Force, his attacks were even faster than before. So much that whenever he swung his blade an after image would appear.Seeing the sword come down towards his head, Jian Chen dodged to the side, and continued to thrust the iron rod towards Luo Jian\u2019s chest.Luo Jian\u2019s face changed as he realized the speed the iron rod was traveling at was extremely high. At that critical moment, his sword was too far out to bring it back to protect himself, but his reaction speed wasn\u2019t too slow either. Reabsorbing the wind Saint Force into his body, he forced his body to move backwards and bring back his sword.Luo Jian\u2019s speed became faster; the moment Jian Chen\u2019s iron touched Luo Jian\u2019s clothes, he had already escaped from Jian Chen\u2019s range of attack. As soon as he had escaped Jian Chen\u2019s range, he immediately started to gather the Saint Force into his hands again to slash at Jian Chen again with the sword.Luo Jian\u2019s attack was fairly simple, but to Jian Chen\u2019s eyes, it was a mess of an attack; not a single amount of technique or finesse was shown. However, Jian Chen still didn\u2019t dare to belittle it too much.Jian Chen leapt into the air to dodge Luo Jian\u2019s sword. Immediately springing off from a tree trunk, he flew towards Luo Jian, his arms shaking, causing a faint mirror image to appear behind him. Jian Chen\u2019s arm was already traveling at high speeds, and the iron rod was traveling at the speed of lightning towards Luo Jian, so even the naked eye wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.Luo Jian\u2019s eyes widened in realization as the iron rod had already reached him. This time Luo Jian was unable to defend himself from Jian Chen\u2019s attack nor was he able to dodge in time, resulting in the iron rod piercing deeply into his chest.Luo Jian\u2019s face hardened as he stared at the impaled iron rod within him, a dumbfounded expression appearing on his face. Not only was there a tinge of disbelief on his face, but despair and fear as well. When the iron rod had pierced into him, he had been unable to mount any type of resistance against it. He had no defense, due to the iron rod being a lot faster in speed than he had been able to react to. Even if he was a wind attribute Saint, the iron rod had still skewered straight through him, causing a fatal injury.What followed afterwards was beyond everyone\u2019s expectations. The moment Jian Chen\u2019s iron rod had pierced into Luo Jian\u2019s chest, everyone had stopped moving, Then, a pure amount of Saint Force transferred from the iron rod into Luo Jian\u2019s body. With the removal of the rod, the support disappeared, and Luo Jian dropped onto the ground.When Jian Chen had sent his Saint Force infused soul into Luo Jian\u2019s body, it was as if his body had exploded. The energy rippled through Luo Jian\u2019s body like an energy wave, wreaking havoc within his organs.\u201cPff!\u201d Luo Jian immediately spit out a mouthful of blood. The fierce pain he was feeling inside his body was strange and unknown to him; he let loose a blood curling scream as he rolled on the ground.Luo Jian\u2019s scream was abnormally desolate and immediately caught the attention of all those still fighting. However, as their eyes looked at the rolling Luo Jian, everyone except Tie Ta was stunned into silence. What they were watching caused them no small amount of shock, and many of them still couldn\u2019t believe their eyes.Even after finishing off Luo Jian, Jian Chen didn\u2019t consider letting the group of robbers go. Holding his iron rod as he stood in the middle, he thought that it was lucky that he had met his older brother Changyang Hu now. If he had met Changyang Hu later, then Jian Chen was afraid that his brother would have lost all of his monster cores to Luo Jian\u2019s group and been left with a heavy injury.With Jian Chen entering the battle, the opposition no longer had the upper hand. Although Jian Chen wasn\u2019t a Saint like everyone else, he undoubtedly was the most powerful amongst everyone present.In his past life, Jian Chen was a traveling wanderer who had practiced the way of the sword, to the point where he had reached perfection with it. His moves were hard to detect since he moved so fast that it was inconceivable at some points. People who were relying on only their eyes wouldn\u2019t be able to see him. Since Jian Chen was only using an iron rod, his true strength could not be brought out. The opponents in front of him were mere students with little battle experience. With his extraordinary sword knowledge, he could quickly end the battle.Until the end of the fight, no one had realized that the weapon Jian Chen was using wasn\u2019t actually a Saint Weapon, but actually just a common iron rod.After the fight, all of the injured students that took part in the robbery sat down on the ground. Each one of them had a different type of wound on different spots, and they all looked at Jian Chen with terror.Looking at the 8 youths on the floor, although Changyang Hu and his team of 4 were heavily injured, they couldn\u2019t help but reveal the joy of victory while looking at Jian Chen with stares of respectful admiration.\u201cChangyang Hu, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d unexpectedly have such an amazingly strong fourth brother. His strength really leaves me astonished!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Changyang Hu. Although we heard about your fourth brother\u2019s strength a long time ago, I didn\u2019t think that he was this amazing until now. Even the middle level Saint Luo Jian was defeated by him; if it weren\u2019t for your fourth brother\u2019s help, I\u2019m afraid that our group wouldn\u2019t have been able to protect the monster cores we worked so hard to get.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.The three youths and Changyang Hu had a decent relationship with each other. Each one of them sighed in joy as they excitedly discussed the recent events.At this moment, Jian Chen arrived by Changyang Hu\u2019s side and looked at his wounds. With some concern he asked, \u201cBig brother, do you have any serious injuries?\u201dHearing this, Changyang Hu shook his head absentmindedly. Looking at Jian Chen with joy and surprise, he replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine, just fine. It\u2019s only a small wound. Don\u2019t forget, your older brother has the earth attributed Saint Force, which improves my defenses by a lot.\u201d Changyang Hu paused for a bit and then asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right, fourth brother, how did you come across the 3rd region; I remember that before we entered the forest, your strength was still before the Saint level? Also, how did you become so amazing, for you to even defeat Luo Jian?\u201d Changyang Hu asked curiously.Jian Chen laughed and said, \u201dBig brother, this type of situation should be explained later over a nice and slow talk. Right now, we still have to take care of the problem in front of us.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s swept his gaze over at the several students who were on the ground, \u201cBig brother, how do you think we should punish these guys?\u201dGiving the question some thought, he said, \u201cFourth brother, this should be resolved by you. If it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019m afraid our group of four would have had all of our monster cores stolen.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s face had a deep smile on it as he said, \u201cIn that case, there\u2019s no need to be merciful to them. At the very least, we should collect all of their monster cores from their Space Belts.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s suggestion was quickly approved by everyone, and so under the poisonous and hateful glares of Luo Jian\u2019s group, they quickly grabbed all of the Space Belts and collected the monster cores inside. After checking their inventories, the 8 of them had a total of 130 monster cores.Seeing such a number, even Jian Chen was astonished by the amount. Changyang Hu exclaimed in admiration, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that they would have this many monster cores; it looks like they robbed many people before us. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill so many monsters in a span of 3 days with their strength.\u201dJian Chen nodded his head in approval before saying, \u201cBig brother, let\u2019s split the cores into 6 parts so that we each get an equal share.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d Jian Chen turned towards the new speaker; a youth from Changyang Hu\u2019s team, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, the only reason we were able to obtain these monster cores was because of you and your fellow comrade here. We didn\u2019t do anything at all, so you shouldn\u2019t split the cores with us and keep it among the two of you.\u201dThe student\u2019s suggestion was quickly approved by the other two students. One of them immediately said, \u201cOz is right. Changyang Xiang Tian, if it weren\u2019t for you and your friend, the strength of us 4 wouldn\u2019t have been enough to win. I\u2019m afraid we wouldn\u2019t have even been able to protect our own monster cores. But now that our monster cores are safe from their grasp, we are satisfied. The monster cores you got from Luo Jian and his friends are something we don\u2019t want.\u201d\u201cRight, Changyang Xiang Tian, you were able to get these monster cores with the combined strength of you and your friend. How could we be shameless enough to divide this up?\u201dJian Chen\u2019s eyes flickered with a bright glow as he looked at their faces, searching for any signs of falsity. However, he could only see sincere honesty, with absolutely no traces of dishonesty. His respect for the 3 grew tremendously, but he truly did admire his older brother the most. He didn\u2019t think his older brother would be able to find 3 friends with such good personalities like this. Although Changyang Hu had the body and brain of a tiger, Jian Chen understood that his brother was not at all stupid.Jian Chen laughed and said, \u201cEveryone had contributed to this situation. If it weren\u2019t for you guys stalling them, if they had somehow joined forces with Luo Jian to attack me, I\u2019m afraid that I would have lost then. Let\u2019s go with this, Tie Ta and I will take half of the monster cores, and you guys will take the rest and divide it amongst yourselves. That should be fine, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was something we all worked hard to do, so let\u2019s follow fourth brother\u2019s idea and split the monster cores. Half of it will be given to fourth brother and his other friend here. The other half will be equally split among the four of us.\u201d Changyang Hu laughed. He and Jian Chen were blood brothers, even though they had different mothers, it did not affect the relationship between them; he would not be stingy with him.With Changyang Hu deciding for them, the other three students couldn\u2019t decline any more and took the monster cores excitedly. After splitting it up, each of the four had gotten at least a dozen, bringing them no small amount of excitement. With this amount, it was more than what they had gotten by themselves after last couple of days.After this event, no one had any plans to stay put anymore, and after changing their location, they began to start a new fire to roast some meat.The six people sat in a circle around the fire as Changyang Hu laughed, \u201cFourth brother, let me introduce you to everyone. These three are my best friends, Oz, Aoba, and Darian.\u201d He pointed at the three, \u201cFourth brother, Oz and Aoba are identical twins. I guarantee that when they wash the filth on their faces off, you won\u2019t be able to tell who is who!\u201dJian Chen smiled and greeted the three one by one. After chatting for a while, they had started to get so familiar with each other that even Tie Ta\u2019s name was known by them.Suddenly, Changyang Hu\u2019s face went still as he asked, \u201cFourth brother, I remember that before you went into the forest, your strength wasn\u2019t at the Saint Level yet. So why is it you\u2019re in the 3rd region? And now being so strong, you were even able to defeat the middle-ranked Wind Saint Luo Jian. Could it be that in the three days you were in the forest, you broke through?\u201dChangyang Hu\u2019s three friends paid close attention to this question; both Darian and the twins became interested after hearing Changyang Hu\u2019s question, and shifted their attention to Jian Chen. Jian Chen beating Luo Jian, had a huge impact on those three. Although they had long since heard the rumors that were circulating throughout the academy that he was strong, the rumors didn\u2019t exaggerate his strength to this extent.Jian Chen laughed and held his iron rod up towards Changyang Hu, \u201cBig brother, look. If I were a Saint, would I still be using a weapon like this?\u201dChangyang Hu looked up and down the iron rod; but it looked the same, he had already recognized the bloodstained iron rod in Jian Chen\u2019s hands and it was a still a normal rusty broken iron rod.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Changyang Hu\u2019s eyes went wide; he was put in a state of silent shock as he would have never in a million years thought that Jian Chen would be able to defeat Luo Jian using only a rusty iron rod, and if this didn\u2019t happen before his very own eyes, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it even if he was beaten to death.At the same time, Darian and the twins looked at the iron rod in Changyang Hu\u2019s hands. The three of them were in disbelief, and then looked at Jian Chen as if he was a monster.Seeing the incredulous looks on their faces, Jian Chen laughed and said, \u201cWith the combined powers of me and Tie Ta, there were no magical beasts that were a match for us in the 2nd region, so we decided to move on to the 3rd region.\u201dHearing this, Changyang Hu and the other three couldn\u2019t believe their ears. The 2nd region was filled with Class 1 Magical Beasts. Although they were weaker and had low attack power, even the average Saint would find surviving in the forest a difficult task, and Jian Chen was still obviously not a Saint yet. To say the 2nd region was no longer a challenge, even Changyang Hu and his friends would curse Jian Chen\u2019s absurd strength.After a while, Changyang Hu and his friends finally recovered their senses. Changyang Hu continued to ask, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re not even a Saint yet and you\u2019re already this amazing. When the day comes and you become a Saint, I really can\u2019t guess how much stronger you\u2019ll become.\u201d Changyang Hu shook his head in awe, \u201cAh right, fourth brother, when do you think you\u2019ll become a Saint?\u201dMuttering more to himself, \u201cI\u2019m currently at the peak of the 10th layer. After this forest exercise, I\u2019ll aim to become a Saint.\u201dChangyang Hu let out a breath of air in surprise and shock as he looked at Jian Chen, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019re simply too amazing for words. Not even a few months ago, you were a new student at Kargath Academy who was only at the 8th layer. I didn\u2019t think that you would reach the peak of the 10th layer in such a short amount of time.\u201dHearing this, Darian and the twins couldn\u2019t believe it and their view of Jian Chen completely changed. The strength Jian Chen had shown was ridiculous, his cultivation speed was fast, and could border the line of the unimaginable. Jian Chen was definitely a genius among geniuses. At this moment, the three friends of Changyang Hu quickly came to a decision that, in the future, they would have to treat him well and avoid offending him.Jian Chen laughed carefreely, \u201cBig brother, I\u2019ve noticed that within the 3rd region, many people are resorting to stealing monster cores from others. How did this happen?\u201dChangyang Hu exhaled before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who started this myself, but it\u2019s said that during the 2nd day, someone started to steal monster cores relying on the fact that he had an enormous amount of people behind him. After this news spread everyone in the 3rd region started to follow suit, forming groups to rob cores. After all, Class 2 Magical Beasts are rare in comparison to Class 1 Magical Beasts, and are even harder to kill. Killing one beast would only get you one, but stealing from another is much easier than hunting, and with good luck, one would get a lot of cores as well..\u201d\u201cSo up until now, all the students started to steal from each other in the 3rd region. Many people have had their hard earned monster cores stolen away from them when they were alone or were smaller in numbers, The people who were injured decided to quit early, reducing the numbers in the area drastically.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t the teachers that are secretly hidden care about what was happening?\u201d Tie Ta asked.\u201cAs long as it isn\u2019t a life threatening injury or a critical point between life or death, then the hidden teachers won\u2019t show up. After all, the reason why we are in the forest hunting Magical Beasts is so we can temper ourselves, not to mention that we are being tested on how we can unite when being robbed; things like this happen often in the Tian Yuan continent. They\u2019re only letting us experience this sooner rather than later.\u201d Said the twins.\u201cAh!\u201d Tie Ta suddenly exclaimed in realization.Jian Chen let loose a strange smile as he looked at his older brother and his friends. \u201cSince other people have the audacity to rob us of our monster cores, why can\u2019t we rob them first? Are you guys with me on this?\u201dThe group\u2019s eyes went bright as they heard Jian Chen.\u201cFine, we\u2019ll do it. Changyang Xiang Tian, we will follow you.\u201d Darian said as he stood up and stared at Jian Chen, the heroic spirit reflected in his voice.\u201cNot bad, before our strength was lacking, and could only run away blindly. But now that Jian Chen is here, even if we meet a middle rank Saint, victory isn\u2019t impossible. Since this is the final night, let\u2019s have some fun with this.\u201d Aoba and Oz laughed.\u201cAlright, fourth brother, your big brother will listen to you.\u201d Changyang Hu said happily.Tie Ta didn\u2019t have an opinion, as he had decided to follow Jian Chen without question for a while now.After everyone had eaten their fill and discussed their plans, they decided to let the twins search the surroundings for targets, while the rest waited for their return.The twins soon came back and reported that they saw a group of 5 people nearby.Jian Chen immediately followed the twins towards where they had reported seeing them.When Jian Chen\u2019s group had reached the place, the 5 people were preparing themselves to rest and were caught unprepared by Jian Chen\u2019s sudden attack. Since the group was only at the Primary Saint level, they were quickly defeated by Jian Chen and his group. However, they didn\u2019t have that many monster cores, only having around 20 or so.After taking the monster cores, they didn\u2019t continue to harass them and immediately left the area.For the entire night, Jian Chen and the others didn\u2019t sleep at all. Instead, they looked around the forest for more targets. There weren\u2019t many people in the 3rd region by now, and ever since he had started his search, he had only come across 3 different groups. But what he and the others found amusing was that halfway through the night, Jian Chen\u2019s group had came across another group who had the same idea they had, and so they had immediately started to fight. Both sides had 6 people each, and the other group even had 2 Middle Saints whose strength could be considered pretty strong. However, those two ended up being stuck against Jian Chen and Tie Ta. In the end, Jian Chen had come out victorious against his opponent, and gained 150 Class 2 Monster Cores as a reward. It would seem that many people had had their monster cores taken by this group.After the third battle, aside from Jian Chen, everyone else was exhausted and could not continue fighting anymore. With no other choice, they spent the rest of the night searching for a secret place to hide and sleep. Although Jian Chen and Tie Ta had wanted to continue, the other 4 weren\u2019t in any shape to, and needed the two of them to stay behind and protect them against any surprise attacks.Without saying, Jian Chen and the group had had an overwhelming harvest; excluding the first group with their 20 monster cores, the other two groups had 70 cores and 150 cores respectfully. So in total, they now had 260 cores.Seeing this many monster cores, Jian Chen was starting to suspect that this was already half of the total amount of Class 2 Monster Cores in the 3rd region.The night passed peacefully, and the group started to travel towards the outside of the forest. With some herbal medicine, Changyang Hu and the others\u2019 wounds were starting to heal slowly. Back when they had first entered the forest, the school administration had already prepared these medicines inside of their Space Belts.At the moment, Changyang Hu and his friends were all wearing well made wolf pelts that made them look as if they had no injuries at all. The wolf pelts were the ones that Jian Chen and Tie Ta had made from when they had slaughtered that pack of wolves; they had collected quite a large amount of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If they could protect the monster cores until they reached the outside, then they would be able to finish the assignment perfectly. And since the academy would not take the cores, they would be able to use it for themselves.Traveling on the road, Jian Chen and the rest were very cautious. This was the crucial moment, since they could be ambushed at any given time. Jian Chen and Tie Ta were still full of life but Changyang Hu and the others were not in the best shape. If they were to be attacked by another strong group, then a fierce battle wouldn\u2019t be avoidable, which was what Jian Chen wanted to avoid.Jian Chen walked down the road with Tie Ta behind him while the rest followed in a straight line as they reached to the part of the forest where the white enchantments of the forest rippled outwards. With the end of the 3rd day, the enchantment had suddenly transformed to help the students who were lost to find their way here.Jian Chen\u2019s soul was lashing out around him as he checked his surroundings. The 3rd region was not as quiet as the 2nd region. Not only did they have to protect themselves from magical beasts, but they also had to protect themselves from other students. Other students were waiting around for the perfect moment to strike. So because of that, the closer one got to the entrance, the more dangerous it became. After all, the enchantment was showing a hole in itself to help lead students out, so many of them were trying to leave the forest and made themselves an open target for those other students waiting to ambush them.A few hours passed, Jian Chen and Tie Ta were getting closer and closer to the 3rd region\u2019s exit. The whole journey had been fairly peaceful, although at regular intervals, they\u2019d encounter a magical beast carcass. Sometimes, there would even be 2-3 magical beast corpses lying in the same location.A few hours of rushing later, Jian Chen\u2019s group of people finally arrived outside of the 3rd region\u2019s exit. They smoothly passed through and entered the 2nd region. At this moment, everyone could not help but sigh in relief. They all understood that their monster cores were secured, because after leaving the 3rd region, no matter whether or not others had gathered the required 2 monster cores, their task was complete. There was nobody here that would dare to steal their monster cores.\u201cHaha, I hadn\u2019t imagined that the journey would be so peaceful. This was really against my expectations.\u201d Changyang Hu happily smiled, his tone also carrying a hint of excitement.Aoba also happily said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, and here I\u2019d thought that we\u2019d fall victim to some surprise attacks. I didn\u2019t think that the path would\u2019ve been so calm. It really goes against all expectations.\u201dDarian reached his hand out to touch his Space Belt and smiled, \u201cI guess the people stealing monster cores in the 3rd region had suffered from injuries, and didn\u2019t have the energy to keep stealing from others on the road. In addition, most of the people probably have the same mindset as us, only stressing self-defense. As long as we safely leave the third region, we\u2019ll be satisfied. None of us are interested in the idea of stealing monster cores anymore.\u201d\u201cYea, that\u2019s right. What you said makes sense.\u201d Tie Ta nodded in agreement.Jian Chen shook his head and said, \u201cThe situation is not necessarily as you think it is. Actually, throughout the whole journey, there were still some people lying in wait along the way in hidden places ready to ambush us, you guys just didn\u2019t notice them. Those people who were hiding in the darkness perhaps noticed that we have a large number of people, or they didn\u2019t have the ability to discern our strength, so they couldn\u2019t determine if they could destroy us. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t make any movements towards us. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way we could\u2019ve safely left the 3rd region.\u201dHearing this, the people\u2019s expressions all changed.Changyang Hu let out a long breath and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing fourth brother made sure we put on perfect acts of being completely undamaged. Otherwise, if the people knew that the four of us were injured, then I\u2019m afraid we wouldn\u2019t have been so fortunate.\u201d Hearing this, Aoba and the others nodded in agreement, and looked at Jian Chen with gazes filled with respect.\u201cAlright, we should hurry up and leave. After we return back to the academy, you guys need to properly tend to your wounds.\u201dThe group of 6 continued to walk towards the 1st region. As they got closer to the exit, the nearby academy gradually entered their lines of vision. Although there were definitely many people that had been unable to endure the task and gave up on it in the middle, at least 1000 people had entered the forest together. Even if more than half had given up, there were still at least a few hundreds of people remaining. However, the mere hundreds of people spread out in the enormous forest rarely met each other, so it was rare to come across others that had decided to remain in the forest.Jian Chen\u2019s gaze swept across the people around him that were similarly heading out of the 1st region towards the academy. He saw that most of the males sported naked torsos, and were covered with wounds. However, without any exception, all the people were in sorry states; their naked torsos were covered with dirt, and their faces could not be discerned with all the filth covering them.Only some of the females still wore the academy uniforms. However, every single one of the uniforms had become beyond dirty, and there were tears all over the clothing. Even a beggar\u2019s clothing was better than theirs. In addition, they used wide leaves to cover the parts that their clothes didn\u2019t, making them look like extremely sorry figures.Amongst all the people, there were also a few people who had serious leg injuries, rendering them unable to walk. They were being supported by their companions the whole way, and approached the outside of the forest, one step after another.Perhaps it was because there were so so many people present here, but there were absolutely no magical beasts in the vicinity. It was even safer than before.Soon after, Jian Chen\u2019s group followed the direction the enchantment in the sky pointed to in order to exit the 1st region, and they finally exited the forest. Outside stood the vice headmaster, Chang Bai En, wearing a white changpao, his back straight. Behind him stood a few teachers with indifferent expressions. Further behind them was a large group of nearly 1000 Kargath Academy students. They were split into two groups: the group on the right had many more times people than the other group. Among them, some people were wearing academy uniforms that were dirty, but had very few tears. On the whole, they seemed to be in excellent and undamaged conditions.The other group of people seemed to be in a more difficult situation. Their uniforms were all tattered, and sported quite a few bloodstains as well. Underneath the multiple rips on their clothes, it could clearly be seen that they sported many scars on their bodies.The people in the left group only had around 200 people. All of them were in sorry states; majority of the people there were wearing clothes made of bark or beast skins, and there were quite a few people that had naked torsos. However, all the people that walked out of the forest were organized by a teacher to join the group on the left.Afterwards, Jian Chen\u2019s group sat on the grass quietly in wait. By this point, he had already understood that all the people in the left group were those that had stayed in the forest for the entire 3 days, and had just left the forest today. On the other hand, the people in the right group were all those that had escaped before the three days were up. According to the academy\u2019s regulations, no matter whether or not they had fulfilled the requirement of obtaining 2 monster cores, they still had failed their tasks.As he swept his gaze in a circle, Jian Chen discovered that many people in the group he was with had melancholic expressions. There were others that looked at certain people with looks of deep hatred, looking like they would spit out flames from their eyes.At that moment, Jian Chen sensed something. He turned around to look behind him, and saw two people with dirty faces and wearing clothing made of beast skins supporting a student in similar attire. The two were currently glaring at Jian Chen with poisonous hatred, as if burning him into a crisp with their gazes alone\u2026.a strong killing intent.After Jian Chen closely examined the people, his mouth formed a hint of a sneer. He already recognized that the person was actually Luo Jian. Although Jian Chen knew that after what happened the previous night, he had definitely wronged Luo Jian, Jian Chen didn\u2019t pay much mind to it. In terms of strength, he wasn\u2019t below Luo Jian at all. Once he was able to condense a Saint Weapon and become a Saint, Luo Jian would no longer pose any threat to him.In terms of family backgrounds, although Jian Chen wasn\u2019t completely sure of Changyang clan\u2019s strength, they were in no means weak in any sort of aspect. Luo Jian was the son of the leader of a major powerful clan in Forbidden City, but in Jian Chen\u2019s opinion, there was no way they Luo clan would bother harassing him over such a trivial matter. After all, Luo Jian had only been injured by Jian Chen because of the training event that the academy had sent them on. In addition, the situation at that time had been because Luo Jian had first attacked his older brother\u2019s group.Afterwards, once all the people had walked out of the forest, Jian Chen\u2019s group had already increased to 300-400 people.At this moment, the vice headmaster Chang Bai En walked up to the front of the crowd. He looked around at the group of figures that had obviously suffered through difficult situations. He smiled, and loudly said, \u201cVery good. As expected, none of you have disappointed me. I hadn\u2019t imagined that this event to hunt magical beasts and stay in the forest for 3 days would have more people remaining this time time compared to all the previous times this event has been held. Now, I want everyone to maintain their current formations, and begin walking back towards the academy.\u201dAfterwards, the entire two groups maintained their exact formations and quickly advanced towards the academy. In the middle of the journey, when they encountered a small river, everyone stopped to wash their faces clean, and then continued forward. Very soon, the group of students began to approach the academy, and in the distance, they noticed that a tall platform had been erected in the center of the sports field.The group of people stopped in front of the platform, and the vice headmaster Chang Bai En, as well as a few teachers, walked up to it. The vice headmaster sat in the chairperson\u2019s place with a straightforward and imposing manner, and calmly said, \u201cThe Magical Beast hunting competition occurring once every three years has now officially ended. According to the academy\u2019s regulations, after the task has been completed, we will now hand out awards. I would like to now invite all the people who had stayed in the forest for the entire 3 days and have gathered 2 monster cores to simultaneously step forwards.\u201dAs soon as the vice headmaster finished speaking, a hundred or so people immediately walked out of the crowd.\u201cI will now first count the Class 1 Monster Cores. Students who have hunted Class 1 Magical Beasts, please come up to the platform for the number of monster cores in your possession to be counted.\u201d The vice headmaster continued.Following this, all the students that had killed Class 1 Magical Beasts, including Jian Chen and Tie Ta, all walked up to the platform. There stood a teacher specifically assigned to count and record the number of monster cores that the students had earned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the students that had Class 1 Monster Cores walked up, only a bit over 30 people remained. This made the students who did not know much about the 3rd region\u2019s conditions puzzled.Although the 3rd region had Class 2 Magical Beasts, they all had low attack powers. To a Saint that could condense a Saint Weapon, although it may not be possible for him/her to fight against the magical beast alone, as long as a few people worked together, hunting magical beasts within the 3rd region shouldn\u2019t be very difficult to do. It should definitely be easier than a student that had not yet reached Saint level killing a Class 1 Magical Beast. After all, the Saint Weapons that Saints had were extremely powerful, and far surpassed those other ordinary weapons.Logically, the chances of students completing their task in the 3rd region should definitely be much higher than those in the 2nd region. However, nobody had imagined that the event would end up with such results. In the 3rd region, only a pathetic 30 or so students had completed their task; this was much less than the people who had finished in the 2nd region.When the first student arrived in front of the teacher inspecting the monster cores, he directly reached into his Space Belt and lightly placed all of his monster cores on the table. This student only took out 3 monster cores total.Casually gazing at the three Class 1 Monster Cores, the approximately 50-year old teacher in charge of inspecting the monster cores nodded and said, \u201cHm, not bad. You qualify as passing. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cTeacher, my name is Cheng Yun Feng.\u201d The youth that was being inspected excitedly said. The two words \u201cNot bad\u201d had already confirmed the fact that the teacher was praising him. Being complimented by the teacher was the greatest honor to him.The teacher picked up his pen and recorded the information on a piece of paper, then said, \u201cGo return your Space Belt to the academy. Take your monster cores. Also, this is a badge that represents your glory. You must take good care of it.\u201d The teacher pulled out a badge from underneath the table, and handed it to the student.The student happily agreed. He carefully and tenderly took the badge, and then he walked off the platform in extremely high spirits.\u201cNext!\u201d\u2026\u2026.Afterwards, students walked up in succession and handed their monster cores to the teacher for appraisal, and at the same time, were recorded. The process was quite fast, and in the blink of an eye, dozens of people had already passed. The fewest number of monster cores among them so far had been 2, and the greatest number had taken out 8, which had made the appraising elder shocked for a moment.At this moment, a handsome youth with an uncommon air walked up to get his monster cores inspected. The youth had a small scar on his forehead, and it was most likely a recent wound from the forest, since the scar still had a hint of blood on it.The youth calmly walked up to the elder, and quietly took off his Space Belt. He then began to take out monster cores, and placed them on the table one by one. As he was removing them, the table was soon filled with 6 Class 1 Monster Cores, yet he showed no signs of stopping. He continued to leisurely pull out monster core after monster core from his Space Belt. His movements were not at all rushed, and the expression on his face was indifferent, giving off the impression that he was a very steadfast person.When the youth first took out 6 monster cores, the inspecting teacher finally returned to his senses. A smile slowly formed on his face, and he lightly nodded while looking at the youth with an expression of admiration.Soon, the youth had already pulled out 10 monster cores. At this moment, the expression of the elder inspecting the monster cores finally changed. His gaze towards the youth was no longer one of admiration, but one of shock. For a person that had not yet reached Saint level to have managed to kill and retrieve monster cores from 10 Class 1 Magical Beasts was definitely not an easy task. In addition, the youth still showed no signs of stopping, signifying to everyone present that he still had not finished removing all of the monster cores from his Space Belt.The students lined up being this youth had already been shocked speechless at the sight of him pulling out so many monster cores. They thought back to how much energy they had consumed in the forest just to retrieve 2-3 monster cores; to them, this had already been quite an amazing achievement. Many of them had even felt quite proud of this. Yet the youth in from of them had pulled out many times more monster cores than they had received within the last 3 days in a single breath. How could they not be shocked? Having fought against the Class 1 Magical Beasts quite a few times, they had been left with a deep realization that without reaching Saint level, using an iron weapon to kill Class 1 Magical Beasts with such thick skin was extremely difficult.The youth did not pay any mind to the onlookers\u2019 expressions, as if he didn\u2019t see them. His movements had still not stopped, and he continued to pull out monster cores from his Space Belt one after another without a pause. Soon, there were already 15 monster cores piled onto the table, yet the youth still didn\u2019t show the slightest trace of stopping. He was still equally unhurried as before, and he very calmly continued to take out more monster cores from his Space Belt.At this moment, all the teachers on the platform were gazing at the youth in shock and disbelief. For a person not yet a Saint to have killed more than 10 magical beasts within 3 days would perhaps be possible if he worked together with 5-6 people, but to have hunted so many magical beasts in 3 days alone was really something the teachers felt was impossible, unless those magical beasts were all seriously wounded.Sitting on top of the platform, the vice headmaster Chang Bai En smiled and said, \u201cHis name seems to be Mu Tian. He only entered the academy last year. After only a single year, he went from the 8th Saint Force layer to the peak of the 10th layer. This speed is quite good. It\u2019s said that he even tried to attack a Saint. Although he ultimately failed, it has to be admitted that the Mu clan really did send a good young successor this time.\u201dThe vice headmaster Chang Bai En paused for a bit, then shifted his gaze towards the lined up Changyang Xiang Tian and Tie Ta and muttered, \u201cI really anticipate Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s harvests. It\u2019s said that the two of them had actually ran to the 3rd region to hunt Class 2 Magical Beasts on the last day. Their powers are clearly not at the Saint level yet. Heavens, to have relied on iron weapons to hunt Class 2 Magical Beasts, that is really too unfathomable. If I hadn\u2019t personally witnessed the two of them kill a completely undamaged Class 2 Magical Beast, I would not dare to believe that such a situation was true. It seems that not only did the headmaster accept a good apprentice, Lore City\u2019s Changyang clan which has been silent for so long will soon return to their former glory because of Changyang Xiang Tian in the near future.\u201dOnly after the youth had taken out 23 Class 1 Monster Cores did he finally stop. He calmly looked at the inspecting elder taking notes, and said, \u201cTeacher, these are the monster cores I retrieved.\u201dThe elder in charge of the inspection swept a glance at the 23 monster cores and let out a long breath. He looked at the youth with bright eyes full of emotions and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMu Tian!\u201d The youth replied in an indifferent tone.The elder\u2019s gaze gradually became more serious as he continued to ask, \u201cMu Tian, did you gain these monster cores by yourself, or did you work together with others for them?\u201dMu Tian\u2019s expression did not change, as he had long since expected this would happen. \u201cTeacher, these monster cores were gained by my hard work alone.\u201dHearing this, the elder\u2019s expression immediately changed. He looked intensely at Mu Tian with an expression beyond admiration, then smiled and nodded, \u201cGood! Good! Good! Mu Tian, right? Very good. Your results are extremely outstanding. I hope that you continue to work hard in the future.\u201d The elder did not ask how Mu Tian had gained the 23 monster cores; that was not important at all. The important part was that he knew that these monster cores had been gained through Mu Tian\u2019s hard work alone. After all, in the Tian Yuan Continent, strength represented everything. As long as one could achieve the final victory, no matter what kind of dishonest methods were used, nobody would say anything about it.Hearing the elder\u2019s words of praise, Mu Tian could not help but smile.At that moment, the elder took about a sky blue belt and badge. He handed them over to Mu Tian and said, \u201cThis is a Space Belt you had previously given us, and this is your badge. Take proper care of them.\u201dMu Tian calmly accepted the Space Belt and the badge of glory, and re-inserted the 23 monster cores into his Space Belt, before walking off the platform. From beginning to end, Mu Tian had not shown a single trace of arrogance or pride; he always had the same, indifferent expression.Jian Chen\u2019s gaze followed Mu Tian until he walked off the platform. In his heart, he had already committed Mu Tian\u2019s name to memory. Based on his intuition, he felt that Mu Tian was probably quite a complex person, and hadn\u2019t used his full potential yet either. In the future, he would definitely accomplish much more; it was simply still unknown which of the two paths he would choose to advance on.Because Mu Tian had taken out over 20 monster cores, the following students didn\u2019t induce any type of reactions when they removed their monster cores. Majority of them had only the minimum 2 monster cores; the number of people that had more than 2 was very few. Aside from Mu Tian\u2019s 23 monster cores, the highest harvest had been the previous 8 monster cores.The inspection went by quickly, and it was soon Jian Chen\u2019s turn. At this moment, the gazes of the vice headmaster sitting in the chairperson\u2019s seat, as well as a few other teachers, immediately lit up. Their eyes closely followed Jian Chen, showing expressions of extreme concentration. The vice headmaster Chang Bai En who had previously been reclining in his seat could not help but straighten his back, as he gazed at Jian Chen, full of expectations. Although he knew that Jian Chen had killed quite a few magical beasts in the forest, he didn\u2019t know the exact numerical value of this \u201cquite a few\u201d.Jian Chen calmly walked up to the elder in charge of inspecting the monster cores and lowered his head to look at the 2 meter long table. A troubled expression showed on his face, and after some hesitation, he said, \u201cTeacher, can you please change to a larger table?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Hearing Jian Chen\u2019s words, the elderly man who was closely inspecting paused, and asked in confusion, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dSeeing that the table was originally not very large, and that there were already some items of little value on top of it, Jian Chen could only show a helpless expression. This table was really too small; there was absolutely no way he could fit all of his monster cores that pretty much completely filled his Space Belt.\u201cYes, teacher. Can I please ask you to change this table to a slightly larger one? This table is too small.\u201d Jian Chen continued.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They all gave extremely strange looks at Jian Chen, and quite a few suspected that they had heard him wrong. In their opinion, if you needed to hand over your monster cores, then just hand them over. Why would you bother caring about how large the table being used was? Wasn\u2019t this simply asking for trouble?\u201cWho is that person? He\u2019s really reckless, to even ask the teacher to change tables\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really an idiot, to dare tell Teacher Steve that the table was too small in front of so many people. The most unfathomable thing is that he wants Teacher Steve to change tables for him. Heavens, for him to confront Teacher Steve about the table being used, does he not know that Teacher Steve is the strictest teacher in all of Kargath Academy?\u201d\u2026\u2026.Quite a few people began to point at Jian Chen in discussion, looking at him as if he was an idiot.The inspecting elder\u2019s expression changed, as he furrowed his brows and stared severely at Jian Chen. He snorted and then in a low voice said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? You even tried to confront a teacher like this; this table was prepared ages ago. It\u2019s not something that can be changed just because you said it should be changed.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s words not only irritated the inspecting teacher, even a few of the teachers judging from the back could not help but knit their brows as they looked at Jian Chen with displeased expressions. Jian Chen\u2019s words were completely disrespectful to them as teachers.Not a single one of the people even considered the fact that Jian Chen had requested for change in tables because the current table had no way of fitting all the monster cores inside his Space Belt.Of course, there were some teachers who were exceptions; their demeanors were still very calm. Their faces only showed a light trace of a smile. These few were the ones who watched Jian Chen and Tie Ta viciously kill a group of Blue Wolf Kings.At this time behind them, a beautiful girl with a pair of bright eyes stared suspiciously at Jian Chen\u2019s figure, frowning in deep thought and whispering softly, \u201cStrange. Why do I feel that his shadow is a little familiar, maybe I\u2019ve met him somewhere?\u201d The girl\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as she thought hard. Suddenly, her eyes flashed, and a familiar figure appeared in her mind. The next moment, her eyes exposed a look of surprise accompanied by a magical color. She unconsciously shouted, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, he is Changyang Xiang Tian!\u201dThe girl\u2019s voice was not concealed at all so many people heard her. The moment everyone heard the name Changyang Xiang Tian, their faces started to change as the students who had been recklessly hurling insults Changyang Xiang Tian started to shut their mouths like obedient children.Changyang Xiang Tian was a name that was prominent throughout Kargath Academy and was practically heard of by everyone. However, not many people had actually seen what he looked like, most of who did were freshmen. Jian Chen\u2019s face was rendered indistinctive with all of the mud and grime that left very little of his face unblemished, his clothes were also extremely tattered to the point of him looking like a beggar. With his current state of appearance, no one would be able to recognize him even when he was lined up in front of everyone.After hearing Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s name, the teacher in charge of inspecting the monster cores went blank as he gave a closer look. Apparently, Changyang Xiang Tian was a name even the teacher was familiar with, however, that didn\u2019t mean that Jian Chen had the proper authority to be able to command him to bring a new table. The teacher\u2019s mouth dropped open one more time in disbelief before preparing himself to speak again, but at that moment, Bai En from the academy board called out, \u201cSomeone bring out a bigger table immediately!\u201d There was a smile on his face instead one of discontent, instead, he was looking at Jian Chen with anticipation as if he had already guessed the reason why Jian Chen had wanted a bigger table.The vice-headmaster Bai En looked as if he was 34 years old, but his prestige within Kargath Academy was exceptionally high, second only to the headmaster himself. When he had spoken, all of the teachers went silent. Aside from a few teachers, the other teachers had not understood what the vice headmaster was trying to say. To think that he had asked for a bigger table even though the original table was more than enough to register a student\u2019s monster core\u2019s count, there was just simply no use for a bigger table.Soon after, a 3 meter long and 2 meter wide table was lifted up to the stage, and the original table that had been used by the inspecting teacher was taken away.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you should be satisfied with this, right?\u201d The inspecting teacher sat in front of the larger table. His attitude towards Jian Chen was not very amiable; it was evident that Jian Chen\u2019s request for a larger table had left an extremely bad impression on the 50-60 year old teacher.Seeing that the elder\u2019s heart had some sort of prejudice against him, Jian Chen could not help but smile bitterly. He hadn\u2019t imagined that just because of something like this, the teacher would actually have something against him. This had definitely gone against his expectations, but Jian Chen didn\u2019t mind it too much.Afterwards, Jian Chen directly removed his Space Belt. Unlike the other students that had removed the monster cores one by one, he directly grabbed a handful of at 10 monster cores and pulled them out, lightly placing them on the table. All of these monster cores were faint white in color, and were about one circle larger than the size of an adult\u2019s finger.Seeing Jian Chen pull out 10 monster cores at once, although the appraising elder was previously unsatisfied with Jian Chen\u2019s earlier actions, he could not help inwardly nodding. However, just as the appraising elder had assumed these were all the monster cores Jian Chen had, Jian Chen\u2019s hand once again reached into his Space Belt, and continue to pull out a great handful of monster cores. Once again, there were 10 of them in his hand.Now there were already 20 monster cores on the table in front. Seeing this, the appraising elder\u2019s eyes lit up. He looked at Jian Chen in astonishment and inwardly thought to himself, \u201cThis Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s reputation is indeed not undeserved. Although he has not yet reached Saint level, he was able to defeat a Saint. It seems that he really is quite skilled.\u201dFollowing this, Jian Chen continued to reach into his Space Belt and once again pulled out a handful of monster cores to gently place onto the table. \u201cDong dong dong\u201d sounds rang out as the hard monster cores came into contact with the wooden table.Seeing Jian Chen once again take out 10 monster cores from his Space Belt, the expression of the appraising elder had instantly changed. His eyes now reflected complete shock, since by now, Jian Chen had taken out 30 monster cores, 7 more than Mu Tian had.For a student that had not yet reached Saint level to have killed 30 Class 1 Magical Beasts within 3 days inside the forest was undoubtedly a record. Even the elder that had gone around the world and witnessed many things before could not help but be dumbstruck by disbelief. Although these magical beasts had relatively low attack power, it was by no means an easy task for a student only at the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer to kill them.When Jian Chen grabbed 30 Monster Cores, the teacher evaluating him became astonished, along with the other teachers behind him as they watched this inconceivable sight. Only a few teachers who had inside information on the matter had a smile on their faces while the students lined up behind him had been dumbstruck when he had pulled the 30 monster cores out.But Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to look at the stupefied expressions on the teachers and students around him. While everyone was staring at him, his hands went into his Space Belt once more and grabbed another bunch of monster cores to put onto the table. When his hand refused to stop, the teachers all looked on with a sluggish expression, as the cycle repeated and he reached into his Space Belt and grabbed yet another handful\u2026Soon after Jian Chen had placed a couple handsful of monster cores onto the table, the big official table was filled with monster cores. Although they were all Class 1 Monster Cores, because they came from different species, the cores would not be the same size or shape. Small cores were almost the size of the big toe of a person, and the biggest cores were the size of a small child\u2019s fist.Whether it was a student or teacher, both groups had been put into shock by Jian Chen. For a person who was not yet at the Saint level state to hunt and kill almost 100 Class 1 Magical Beast in a span of 3 days; if someone were to try to say this to someone else, they wouldn\u2019t be believed. At this moment, aside from a small amount of people, every other person would not believe that it was Jian Chen who had killed all these magical beasts. Many people had thought that the huge amount of monster cores were a result of many people helping him collect monster cores or that he had stolen them. The consensus was that he could not have killed all those Class 1 Magical Beast by himself.Seeing the official table being covered by a little under 100 monster cores from Jian Chen, the teacher in charge of counting them let out a deep breath. Although in his heart he thought that Jian Chen had to have fought many other groups for their monster cores. He had to admire Jian Chen\u2019s strength however, even when it came to dishonorable acts like thievery, the teachers would not care since this is a common event in the Tian Yuan continent.Seeing almost 100 Class 1 Monster Cores from Jian Chen, the vice headmaster Bai En let loose an incredulous look. He knew in his heart that the reason why the 2nd region had so many less people hunting for monster cores was because they had been robbed by Jian Chen. There was no doubt that Jian Chen had stolen all of the monster cores from someone else, otherwise, everyone would have passed the test with the monster cores they earned by a legitimate show of strength from killing magical beasts.With this recent development, the vice headmaster Bai En was quite emotional today as even his heart shook. Though at the same time, there was a small amount of doubt, could it be that Jian Chen and Tie Ta could easily kill magical beasts without even adding qi to weapons? Were they just not using cultivation anymore? Unexpectedly, Jian Chen and Tie Ta had both killed around 100 magical beasts over the span of the last three days.The look in the teacher\u2019s eye was quite complicated. Soon after he had started to count the monster cores on the table; the teacher didn\u2019t ask how Jian Chen had acquired these monster cores since the definite conclusion was already clear in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The elder in charge of the appraisal said, \u201cThere is a total of 98 monster cores here. This is your Space Belt; please return the academy Space Belt now.\u201d The elder handed Jian Chen an emerald green Space Belt; this was the Space Belt that Jian Chen\u2019s father, Changyang Ba, had gifted him when he had left the Changyang clan.Jian Chen looked at the academy Space Belt in his hands for a bit, and after some hesitation said, \u201cTeacher, for the time being, please take care of my belt here. After this evaluation ends, I will return the academy Space Belt.\u201dHearing this, the elder knit his brows, and asked in confusion, \u201cWhat?\u201d Perhaps it was because Jian Chen alone had gained nearly 100 monster cores, but the elder\u2019s attitude towards Jian chen had clearly changed.\u201cTeacher, I still have Class 2 Monster Cores in my Space Belt, so I still need to take part in the Class 2 Monster Cores evaluation later.\u201d Jian Chen plainly said. Right now, the evaluation was only being held for Class 1 Monster Cores; the evaluation for Class 2 Monster Cores wouldn\u2019t begin until after this one finished.\u201cHm, is that so? You still have Class 2 Monster Cores?\u201d Hearing this, the elder had disbelief written on his face, and he looked at Jian Chen with suspicion. It wasn\u2019t only the elder, the other teachers sitting on the platform were currently looking at Jian Chen with identical expressions.Jian chen nodded, \u201cYes, Teacher!\u201dHearing this, the elder let out a deep breath. His gaze towards Jian Chen grew solemn. Only now did he realize that he had really underestimated the rumors that had been going around about Changyang Xiang Tian. However, he didn\u2019t bother wasting his breath on this matter, and waved his hand, \u201cAlright, store away these monster cores. You can continue to attend the second round of evaluations.\u201dAfterwards, Jian Chen placed the 100 or so monster cores back into his Space Belt and left the platform. However now, both the teachers on the platform and the students surrounding him looked at Jian Chen with completely different expressions. Their gazes were complicated, mixed with jealousy, envy, and even some with disdain.After walking off the platform, Jian Chen didn\u2019t rejoin the crowd. Instead, he walked up to the people waiting for the Class 2 Monster Cores evaluation that were currently lined up in wait. All the students awaiting evaluation had already reached Saint level, and aside from Changyang Hu\u2019s group, all of them looked at Jian Chen with expressions of shock and doubts as he walked up to them. They hadn\u2019t even met Jian Chen in the 3rd region, and it was obvious that they found it extremely abnormal for a person not yet a Saint to be able to show off Class 2 Monster Cores. The really found it extremely hard to believe that Jian Chen had actually entered the 3rd region and killed Class 2 Magical Beasts; in addition, he had at least managed to gain two Class 2 Monster Cores.Lined up behind Jian Chen was Tie Ta. After Jian Chen walked off, Tie Ta also arrived in front of the appraising elder.At this point, Tie Ta being the Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster\u2019s apprentice was no longer a secret; all the teachers recognized him. When Tie Ta walked up, the appraising elder could not help but smile as he said, \u201cTie Ta, I wonder what your profits were like this time?\u201dTie Ta laughed, but did not say anything in reply. Just as Jian Chen had done, he reached his hand into his Space Belt and directly pulled out a large handful of monster cores, before lightly placing them on the table. Tie Ta\u2019s fists were slightly larger than Jian Chen\u2019s, so each one held 14-15 monster cores every time.Seeing the 14-15 monster cores on the table, the appraising elder began to smile, as he inwardly thought to himself, \u201cAs expected of the person that the headmaster has his eye on. Although he has the heart and body of a tiger and seemed to lack shrewdness, his talent really cannot help but make one sigh in admiration.\u201dAfter taking out 14-15 monster cores, Tie Ta\u2019s movements didn\u2019t stop at all. He once again reached into his Space Belt to pull out a fistful of monster cores. The students and teachers all stared at the table as gradually, the number of monster cores increased more and more, until there were multiple dozens.Only after Tie Ta had finally taken out a little under 100 monster cores did he finally stop. Seeing all the monster cores he had gained, Tie Ta laughed in a straightforward manner and happily said, \u201cTeacher, these are the monster cores I have gained.\u201dAt that moment, all the teachers and students in the vicinity were shocked speechless. They all stared at the slightly under 100 monster cores piled on the table with expressions of disbelief.The appraising elder let out a long breath, and then looked at Tie Ta intensely, and slowly said, \u201cGood, good. Tie Ta, you\u2019ve done very well, and have not lost any face for your master.\u201d Saying this, the elder lowered his head and began to count the monster cores. He did not inquire how Tie Ta had gained those monster cores. In his heart, he had already linked together Tie Ta\u2019s means of collecting the monster cores with Jian Chen\u2019s.The elder quickly finished counting the monster cores and said, \u201cThere are a total of 97 monster cores here.\u201d Saying this, the elder recorded it into his notebook.After he had finished taking note, the elder took out an exquisite, extremely well-made, black Space Belt adorned with a few gems, and handed it over along with the badge of glory to Tie Ta, and said, \u201cTie Ta, this is the Space Belt that you had left in our care, as well as the badge of glory that you have earned. Collect your monster cores, and then return the academy Space Belt to the academy.\u201dIt was obvious from a single glance that this high-grade Space Belt had been given to Tie Ta by the headmaster after he had become the headmaster\u2019s apprentice. Otherwise, a child born into a commoner family like him would have absolutely no way of purchasing such a high-grade item like this Space Belt. Although these types of Space Belts were not uncommon in Tian Yun Continent, it was not something that ordinary people could own.Tie Ta\u2019s gaze was locked onto the black Space Belt for while, before he shook his head and said, \u201cTeacher, I would like to keep this Space Belt under your care. I still have Class 2 Monster Cores.\u201d\u201cWhat! You also have Class 2 Monster Cores?\u201d Hearing this, the appraising elder looked at him with an extremely shocked expression, with a hint of disbelief hidden as well.Hearing Tie Ta\u2019s words, the other teachers that were sitting on the platform exchanged glances of disbelief with each other. They hadn\u2019t imagined that after Jian Chen, there would be another student not yet at Saint level that had managed to gain Class 2 Monster Cores.That appraising elder hesitated for a bit before replying, \u201cTie Ta, did you go to the 3rd region?\u201d Although the elder\u2019s question was overstepping his responsibilities, he could not ignore the strong feelings of curiosity in his heart. Even though he had already guessed the answer, he would definitely not dare to believe it unless Tie Ta confirmed the situation.Tie Ta nodded, and spoke in a muffled voice, \u201cYes, I went to the 3rd region.\u201dThe appraising elder continued to ask, \u201cDid you gain your Class 2 Monster cores from killing magical beasts?\u201d Despite the fact he was far overstepping his boundaries, nobody tried to stop him, since it was not only the elder that was extremely curious to know the answer. Even all of the teachers on the platform felt the same way, and they wanted a clear-cut confirmation.\u201cA portion of it was gained from Changyang Xiang Tian and I killing magical beasts.\u201d Tie Ta had no intention of hiding anything, but he only said half of the story.Hearing this, the elder asked in shock and disbelief, \u201cWhat! You\u2019re saying that you and Changyang Xiang Tian killed Class 2 Magical Beasts?\u201dTie Ta nodded and replied, \u201cYes.\u201dThis answer made all of the teachers on the platform stunned. Many of them couldn\u2019t believe what they had just heard; for two students not yet Saints to have killed Class 2 Magical Beasts was unprecedented in the history of Kargath Academy.Afterwards, Tie Ta stowed away his monster cores and walked off the platform. He joined the group of people waiting for Class 2 Monster Cores evaluations, and stood behind Jian Chen. However at this point, Tie Ta and Jian Chen had already become the center of everyone\u2019s attention, and the people who had failed the task that were currently standing behind them looked at the two with quite a lot of jealousy. There were many of them that had been pathetically running all over the place to escape from the pursuits of Class 1 Magical Beasts, and they had never imagined that Jian Chen and Tie Ta, who were not at higher levels than them, would manage to not only gain a hundred Class 1 Monster Cores in the 2nd area, but also gain Class 2 Monster Cores. This made them feel extremely disoriented, and quite a few of the upperclassmen felt embarrassed as well.Soon afterwards, the Class 1 Monster Cores evaluation ended. The one that had the highest number of monster cores was Jian Chen, with a total of 98 monster cores, while Tie Ta was in second place, with one less monster core. The two of them had many more times monster cores than Mu Tian, who was in third place.Amidst the crowd of people, Mu Tian\u2019s eyes flashed in astonishment at Jian Chen and Tie Ta, and he murmured to himself, \u201cTie Ta, Changyang Xiang Tian, your reputation is well-deserved. You two are indeed experts that can defeat Saints. I\u2019d love to have a chance to interact with the both of you.\u201dAlthough he had had his spotlight taken away by Jian Chen and Tie Ta, Mu Tian did not show a single trace of dissatisfaction. He was still just as indifferent as before, as if this was an insignificant matter that had absolutely no impact on him.At that moment, Changyang Hu walked up to Jian Chen with a happy expression, and said in a low voice, \u201cFourth brother, the two of you are really too abnormal. Within 3 days, each of you managed to gain nearly 100 monster cores.\u201d Changyang Hu\u2019s tone barely concealed his happiness, and he looked at Jian Chen proudly.Jian Chen smiled wordlessly. Suddenly, his gaze shifted as he sensed something. He looked behind him to see a youth with tattered clothes glaring at him with poisonous hatred. The youth\u2019s gaze did not bother to conceal his strong killing intent, and it was so severe that Jian Chen could not help but furrow his brows.However, when Jian Chen inspected the youth\u2019s appearance a bit more closely, his heart suddenly skipped a beat. The youth was Luo Jian, who had all of his monster cores plundered by Jian Chen. Luo Jian\u2019s monster cores had been entirely stolen from him mercilessly, and he had even been heavily injured. Although it did not greatly affect his movements, since he and his group of companions had completely lost all of their battle spirit, they had been unable to gather the energy to steal others\u2019 monster cores or hunt magical beasts afterwards. Thus, Luo Jian\u2019s group had ended the task with failure.Jian Chen smiled, his expression showing a hint of disdain. He paid absolutely no mind to Luo Jian. In regards to people like Luo Jian, Jian Chen had met many of them as a wanderer in his previous world. However, very few of them had the ability to really stir up storms.The second round of monster core evaluations soon started. The students that had reached Saint levels and finished their task walked up to the platform in succession. However, there were two exceptions among them: Jian Chen and Tie Ta, who had not yet reached Saint level, while everyone else had.The teacher evaluating the Class 2 Monster Cores was still the same elder, and the assessment progressed quickly. Because of all the stealing that had occurred in the 3rd region, the several hundred students\u2019 monster cores had ultimately been gathered by the 30-40 people present. Thus, all of them had much more than 2 monster cores, and many people had over 10 monster cores in their possessions. There were even quite a few people that had gained 23 monster cores.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this time, an unusual young man came up. This young man had tattered clothes but the arrogance between his brows was present as ever. When he came up to the table, he quickly brought out a huge pile of Monster Cores to place onto the table.The old man in charge of the inspection obviously knew this young man and after counting the number of Monster Cores on the table, he said appraisingly, \u201cThere are a total of 93 Magic Cores. Pretty good, Cheng Ming Xiang, your score is exceptionally good.\u201dHearing Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s name, Tie Ta, who was at the end of the line, looked at Cheng Ming Xiang standing in front of the table, waiting for his evaluation to finish. Tie Ta\u2019s eyes were bright with battle spirit; he hadn\u2019t been able to forget his last unfinished fight against Cheng Ming Xiang. At that time, he wasn\u2019t as strong as he was right now, especially after killing magical beasts in the forest for the past 3 days. Since he had also gained some pointers from Jian Chen, Tie Ta\u2019s current fighting abilities were far greater than they had been before. He believed that with his current strength, as well as his newly gained battle experience, he would be able to fully utilize his godly strength in the fight to make up for the difference in Saint Force between the two of them. There was definitely no way he\u2019d lose to Cheng Ming Xiang.Although Tie Ta appeared to be thick-headed, he clearly understood that this was not the time to spar against Cheng Ming Xiang, so he could only angrily glare at Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s back. Eventually, he managed to suppress his strong desire to fight Cheng Ming Xiang.Hearing the elder\u2019s praise, Cheng Ming Xiang smiled, and his eyes showed pride and a hint of arrogance behind them.The appraising elder recorded the value in his notebook, then continued, \u201c93 Class 2 Monster Cores, huh! If nothing unexpected happens, then you will definitely be part of the top 3 places for Class 2 Monster Cores. In addition, you are the Cultivation Genius, so your future is boundless. Keep working hard.\u201d\u201cThank you very much for your praise, Teacher Steve!\u201dThe elder\u2019s compliments made Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s arrogant expression even more pronounced.Afterwards, Cheng Ming Xiang returned the academy Space Belt and retrieved his own as well as the badge of glory, before stepping off the platform.After Cheng Ming Xiang left, another student with similarly tattered clothes walked up to the table. He directly pulled out a large handful of monster cores; it seemed that he did not have any less monster cores than Chen Ming Xiang.The appraising elder smiled and nodded, his gaze resting on the youth\u2019s face as he slowly said, \u201cNot bad, Huang Dong. It seems that your harvest this time is quite plentiful.\u201dHearing Huang Dong\u2019s name, quite a few students below the platform exclaimed in shock. Jian Chen\u2019s expression also shifted, his gaze immediately locking onto that youth\u2019s figure. Jian Chen was no stranger to Huang Dong\u2019s name; his strength was third on Kargath Academy\u2019s top 10 experts list. Jian Chen had heard that his power had already reached the peak Saint level last year, and he was only one step away from becoming a Great Saint. In addition, once he successfully broke through, it would signify that he could graduate.Kargath Academy\u2019s top 10 experts list referred to the 10 strongest and most formidable students. All of them had already reached peak Saint level, and were not far from becoming Great Saints. Once they broke through, they would leave the top 10 experts circle.In response to the elder\u2019s praise, Huang Dong only smiled, and did not reply.Soon, the elder had already finished counting the monster cores on the table. Huang Dong had earned a total of 91 monster cores, 2 less than Cheng Ming Xiang.Once Huang Dong had left the platform, more people from the top 10 experts list appeared on the platform. Almost all of them had numerous monster cores, and the first ranked student on the top 10 experts list, Bogadi, had a total of 103 monster cores. However, among these top 10 experts, only 4 of them had completed the task; the other 6 had all been eliminated. They had encountered people of the same level as they were, but had lost to the opposite party due to a difference in numbers. Thus, their monster cores had been plundered.Very quickly, all the people on the top 10 experts lists had already left the platform. The people remaining were all extremely well-known. At this point, the one who had displayed the highest number of monster cores so far was the first ranked on the top 10 experts list\u2014\u2014Bogadi, with a total of 103 monster cores.The person in second place was the fifth ranked, one of the top 10 experts list: Jing Ming Yue. She was also the sole female on the top 10 experts list. She had earned a total of 101 monster cores, 2 less than Bogadi had.The person in third place was Cheng Ming Xiang, with a total of 93 monster cores. Although he was not on the list of top 10 experts, his power had already reached the upper Saint levels, and he was also a higher-ranked elite at Kargath Academy. His abilities were not much lower than the people in the list of top 10 experts, and at Kargath Academy, he had acclaimed the title of the Cultivation Genius. His cultivation speed was much higher than most people\u2019s, and his abilities in battle couldn\u2019t be underestimated either.After the three of them had left, all the people had already determined the top 3 winners, because the only people left in line were people who were not well-known in Kargath Academy. Their powers were all only primary or mid Saint levels, and there was, naturally, no way they could compare to the other three.Changyang Hu\u2019s group of four had managed to pillage quite a few monster cores thanks to being with Jian Chen. Although the four of them had equally split half the cores, each one of them had still managed to get 30-40 of them. Even though this did not count as that plentiful of an amount, based on their strengths, this number was already quite good. After all, they were only primary level Saints.Very soon, all the Saints had already finished their evaluations. Although there were people who had quite a few monster cores, none of them had more than the third place holder. Right now, the only 2 people remaining were Tie Ta and Jian Chen.Currently, both the teachers on the platform and the students below it had their gazes locked onto Jian Chen and Tie Ta. The two of them weren\u2019t Saints yet, but they had reached the level at which they could kill Class 2 Magical Beasts. This made quite a few people feel intense jealousy and emotions of turmoil. At that moment, everyone was trying to guess how many monster cores were on these two, who hadn\u2019t condensed Saint Weapons yet. Of course, nobody dared to use the other upperclassmen as a basis for Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s earnings; they all guessed that the two of them wouldn\u2019t have that many Class 2 Monster Cores on them.Jian Chen walked up to the appraising elder and removed his Space Belt. At this moment, the elder was looking at Jian Chen with an expression of praise; the previous prejudices he originally had towards Jian Chen had now completely disappeared. Although he was sure that Jian Chen and Tie Ta would definitely not have more than 10 Class 2 Monster Cores in their possessions, just the fact that the two of them had entered the 3rd region and slayed Class 2 Magical Beasts without being a Saint was already something that the elder had to have a whole new level of respect for. After all, this was the first time non-Saints had ever been able to kill Class 2 Magical Beasts in the history of Kargath Academy.At that moment, the listless teachers sitting on the platform could not help but get excited. One by one, they turned their gaze towards Jian Chen.Jian Chen calmly swept his gaze across the surrounding teachers. When he confirmed that the teachers were staring at him with eyes that were bright with anticipation, his previous indifferent expression could not help a subtle smile. He directly reached into his Space Belt and removed a handful of Class 2 Monster Cores and placed them on the table; there seemed to be around 10 of them.After seeing Jian Chen take out the 10 Class 2 Monster Cores, many of the teachers on the platform had expressions of shock and disbelief. It was very obvious that this number had surpassed most of their expectations. After all, in terms of strength, the difference between Class 2 Magical Beasts and Class 1 Magical Beasts was extremely great. Based on their original assumptions, it would\u2019ve been quite amazing if Jian Chen only had 3-4 Class 2 Monster Cores. However, they hadn\u2019t imagined that he would actually have 10 of them.Following this, without waiting for the others\u2019 minds to form any more thoughts, Jian Chen once again withdrew a fistful of Class 2 Monster Cores from his Space Belt.Currently, the number of Class 2 Monster Cores on the table had already reached over a dozen in number. This amount was already equal to the number of cores that some of the Saint students had gained the past 3 days.Witnessing this scene, all the teachers on the platform showed incredulous expressions. Even the appraising elder could not help but be shocked speechless at the dozens of monster cores that Jian Chen had pulled out. Although there were only a few dozen Class 2 Monster Cores, this still made the teachers\u2019 emotions surge even more than when Jian Chen had pulled out around 100 Class 1 Monster Cores in a single breath. After all, these Class 2 Monster Cores had been pulled out by a person that hadn\u2019t reached Saint level yet.At that moment, all the teachers suddenly realized that if those dozens of monster cores had been earned by Jian Chen personally killing Class 2 Magical Beasts, then his future achievements would be\u2026.When the teachers thought of a student that was not yet a Saint killing Class 2 Magical Beasts, a dozen of them in fact, they could not help but find it incredible.Vice headmaster Chang Bai En, who was sitting in the chairperson\u2019s spot, had a satisfied smile and murmured, \u201cNot bad, not bad, not bad at all. The only thing that remains unknown is how many of these monster cores you were able to earn by killing magical beasts with your own strength. It seems this will have to be more closely investigated later.\u201dAfter taking out dozens of Class 2 Monster Cores, Jian Chen\u2019s movements still did not stop. His hand once again reached into his Space Belt and pulled out another handful of monster cores. Afterwards, Jian Chen\u2019s movements continued to repeat, and under all the incredulous teachers\u2019 shocked gazes, he continued to pull out various sized Class 2 Monster Cores, until the whole table was completely covered.Seeing the table full of Class 2 Monster Cores, all the teachers on the platform were stuck in a daze. Even the students below the platform that could see what was going on at the table had expressions of disbelief, as if they had just witnessed an unfathomable scene.The appraising elder inhaled deeply, and tried to quell his emotions of shock as well as he could to calm himself down. The monster cores on the table were ones that he had never in his lifetime seen before, and he had seen many more higher-level monster cores before. Yet these Class 2 Monster Cores could not be described through ordinary means.The appraising elder looked intensely at Jian Chen before lowering his head to count the monster cores. Soon, the assessment had finished. However, the elder had a shocked expression of disbelief on his face, as his emotions that had just calmed down now began to surge uncontrollably once more. He sat in front of the table in a daze, unable to open his mouth and report the number of monster cores.A few breaths later, the vice headmaster Chang Bai En sitting in the chairperson\u2019s position could finally no longer wait any longer, and said, \u201cSteve, hurry up and report the number of monster cores.\u201d Vice headmaster Bei En\u2019s tone trembled slightly with excitement, although his expression was extremely calm.Hearing the vice headmaster\u2019s words, the appraising elder took a deep breath, before declaring, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, number of Class 2 Monster Cores gained: 118.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The whole arena instantly became so silent, that one would\u2019ve been able to hear a pin drop.This number made even the vice headmaster Chang Bei En speechless. His gaze locked onto the huge pile of Class 2 Monster Cores on the table with an expression of astonishment. This number far surpassed the amount of monster cores that the previous first place winner, Bogadi, had.A while passed before a student couldn\u2019t help but shout out, \u201cNo way, that\u2019s definitely impossible. How could he, who isn\u2019t yet a Saint, be able to gain so many monster cores in the 3rd region, and have even way more than the school\u2019s top-ranked expert. Bogadi? This is definitely impossible. He definitely brought these monster cores from an outside source.\u201dThe single input raised a flood of responses. As the student finished speaking, more and more cries of protest rang out. Jian Chen\u2019s nearly 100 Class 1 Monster Cores had already made many people jealous, and had made them feel that it was unfair. Now that he had taken out 118 Class 2 Monster Cores, which was an amount even greater than his Class 1 Monster Cores, the students were no longer able to accept it.Under the platform, the currently number 1 expert in Kargath Academy\u2019s rankings, Bogadi, was staring at Jian Chen\u2019s back in shock as he murmured, \u201cHis strength is obviously not yet at Saint level; how could he have gotten so many Class 2 Monster Cores? Could it be that these monster cores really were taken from an outside source?\u201d Bogadi also couldn\u2019t help but think the same way as the others. However, this assumption was immediately rejected by him, since before entering the forest, the school administration had completely confiscated all of the students\u2019 Space equipment, and the students had all gone through very strict inspections. In addition, the forest only had one entrance, so there was no chance for someone to sneak monster cores in from the outside.Moreover, even if someone really did manage to bring them in, Bogadi believed that nobody would be stupid enough to present 100+ Class 2 Monster Cores at once. That would undoubtedly make the entire school shocked, and the administration would definitely hire people to investigate the situation.Nearby, a gorgeous girl in tattered clothes looked absentmindedly at Jian Chen\u2019s figure on the platform and muttered, \u201cHow could that be? A freshman like him who isn\u2019t yet a Saint actually managed to get 100+ Class 2 Monster Cores?\u201d The girl\u2019s melodious voice was filled with shock and incredulity.On the other side, when he heard the appraising elder announce Jian Chen\u2019s monster core amount, Cheng Ming Xiang gaped in shock as he stared disbelievingly at Jian Chen. However, his expression soon became gloomy, and eventually became completely replaced by wrath. This was because the person in third place for the monster cores competition received rewards. Although these rewards were not worth that much to those born in major clans, like him, instead it seen as a great honor, a verification of strength. Originally, Cheng Ming Xiang had been placed as third, but now with Jian Chen in the picture, he had been forcibly pushed out of the top three. This made him extremely angry; what was even harder to accept was the fact that Jian Chen still wasn\u2019t even a Saint.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian\u2026\u201d Shifting his gaze, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s face became beyond gloomy as he looked at Jian Chen with a glare full of poisonous malice.In the crowd, Luo Jia\u2019s expression was equally gloomy. He glared hatefully at Jian Chen, as if he could eat Jian Chen alive with his gaze alone.Although Jian Chen\u2019s current strength was still quite weak, his \u201cSpirit\u201d was extremely powerful. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be able to notice an ordinary gaze, but once a particularly severe gaze was pointed towards him, his Soul could immediately detect it. Thus, Luo Jian\u2019s and Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s malice filled glares were immediately sensed by Jian Chen. He turned around and used the aid of his powerful Soul to track the glances\u2019 sources, and easily found Luo Jian buried in the crowd.Seeing Luo Jian\u2019s dark expression, Jian Chen sneered, but did not pay any mind to it. He had swiped all of Luo Jian\u2019s monster cores from him, forcing him to fail the task. In addition, Jian Chen had injured Luo Jian as well, so it was completely normal for Luo Jian to hate Jian Chen so much.However, as Jian Chen\u2019s vision shifted towards Cheng Ming Xiang, his brows furrowed as he showed a helpless expression. He didn\u2019t have any enmity with Cheng Ming Xiang; the previous incident in front of the library was so minor that it couldn\u2019t have been the cause of such fierce hatred. The main reason was the fact that Jian Chen had forcibly pushed Cheng Ming Xiang out of the top 3.After all, being able to place as the top 3 among the entire academy was an achievement that was an extreme glory. This was especially true for those born in noble clans, as this honor could directly increase their status by a large amount.If it were any of the top 10 experts that had pushed Cheng Ming Xiang out of the first 3 places, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have felt unhappy at all. However, since the one who had forced Cheng Ming Xiang out of the top three wasn\u2019t even on the top 10 list, he was also only a freshman who did not even reach the Saint level yet, causing Cheng Ming Xiang, Kargath Academy\u2019s cultivation genius, to feel humiliated. He couldn\u2019t imagine that a freshman that had just entered the school would end up reaching his level, and from this feeling, a hatred towards Jian Chen was born.Although there was also Tie Ta, who was the headmaster\u2019s apprentice, and thus had a greater power behind him than Cheng Ming Xiang had. Of course, Cheng Ming Xiang wouldn\u2019t dare to casually offend the headmaster.The appraising elder took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down. He looked at Jian Chen profoundly, and smiled, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019ve really made me shocked. I hadn\u2019t imagined that someone like you who isn\u2019t yet a Saint could actually gain so many Class 2 Monster Cores. You\u2019ve already far surpassed the previous first place, Bogadi. It seems that this competition\u2019s first place has definitely been taken by you.\u201d The elder handed Jian Chen his own Space Belt and the badge of glory.Jian Chen laughed, and reached out to accept the items. \u201cTeacher\u2019s words are too much. Nobody can say yet who first place will be. After all, Tie Ta is still behind me. The number of monster cores he has is not any less than me.\u201d Saying this, Jian Chen re-stowed all of the monster cores into his Space Belt.Hearing Jian Chen\u2019s words, the elder shot Jian Chen a deep glance, and he smiled wordlessly.After Jian Chen had completely stored away all of the Class 2 Monster Cores on the table, he directly walked off the platform. Afterwards, Tie Ta walked up to the table, and began to take out his own Class 2 Monster Cores from his Space Belt.Tie Ta had entered the 3rd region with Jian Chen, and they had equally distributed the monster cores. Thus, he had pretty much exactly the same amount of monster cores Jian Chen had. After the appraising elder finished counting, it was revealed that Tie Ta had a total of 119 Class 2 Monster Cores, only one more than Jian Chen.After the appraising elder announced Tie Ta\u2019s total amount of monster cores, all of the people at the arena were once again shocked speechless.Below the platform, the fifth ranked person on Kargath Academy\u2019s top 10 experts, Jing Ming Yue, was in a daze. From the look in her eyes, it seemed as if she had lost her spirit. She had suddenly been forced out of second place by two freshmen; this result was difficult for her to accept. After all, she had spent a lot of energy and effort earning those monster cores. She couldn\u2019t imagine how the two newly entered non-Saint freshmen could\u2019ve gotten so many monster cores.At that moment, an extremely beautiful girl walked up to Jing Ming Yue, and intimately hugged her arms around Jing Ming Yue\u2019s waist. Laughing, she said, \u201cSister Jing, you hadn\u2019t imagined that you would\u2019ve been forced down from second place by two new freshmen, right?\u201dJing Ming Yue sighed, and bitterly smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s really unfathomable. Those two freshmen haven\u2019t even reached Saint level, and yet they were able to gain so many monster cores. The two of them even forced Kargath Academy\u2019s number one expert, Bogadi, down to third place. I really have no clue how they got their hands on so many monster cores. Could it really be possible that they had brought them in from outside?\u201dThe girl giggled in response, \u201cSister Jing, you\u2019ve guessed wrongly. I believe that those Class 2 Monster Cores were earned from their own strength, not from outside as you suspect.\u201dThe girl\u2019s words made Jing Ming Yue start. Jing Ming Yue turned around and glance doubtfully at the girl, and asked in a curious tone, \u201cXiao Le, why do you say that?\u201dThe girl smiled mysteriously, as she showed a prideful expression. In a low voice, she said, \u201cSister Jing, I encountered those two in the 2nd region, and even stayed with them for an entire day. You cannot underestimate them; they\u2019re both very formidable. Especially that Changyang Xiang Tian, he managed to kill quite a few Class 1 Magical Beasts with a lousy iron rod by piercing them directly through the throat.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Jing Ming Yue asked in shock, obviously not believing it.\u201cOf course, I saw it with my own eyes. There\u2019s no way it\u2019d be false.\u201d The girl puffed out her chest and said firmly, \u201cAlso, that night, we encountered a secret attack from 20+ Blue Wolves. The two of them effortlessly killed all of them.\u201d\u201cWhat? You said that the two of them managed to kill 20+ Blue Wolves by themselves?\u201d Hearing this, Jing Ming Yue could no longer hide her shock. Although she was already a high level Saint, she would still flee if she faced 20+ Class 1 Magical Beasts, let alone kill them.The girl vigorously nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Sister Jing. I personally witnessed it. Although Changyang Xiang Tian and Tie Ta haven\u2019t condense their Saint Weapons, their strength is definitely not any weaker than a Saint\u2019s. That\u2019s why I can promise that the monster cores in their hands are definitely not brought in from the outside.\u201dHearing this, Jing Ming Yue lowered her head and thought it over seriously. Despite the fact that Jian Chen and Tie Ta had forced her out of the top 3 places, she didn\u2019t show a trace of dissatisfaction in her expression. From this alone, it could be seen that Jing Ming Yue was not a narrow-minded person.After the evaluation had finished, the awards ceremony began. This time, the event\u2019s top 3 places for both Class 1 Monster Cores and Class 2 Monster Cores would receive the same rewards. The first place reward was a Class 4 Monster Core and a medal of honor completely made from Purple Coins. Both second place and third place rewards included one Class 3 Monster core, and a medal of honor made from Gold Coins.These medals weren\u2019t worth much money, but what they represented was of extraordinary significance. Thus, even the nobles that had powerful backgrounds couldn\u2019t keep their eyes from reddening at those medals of honor.Jian Chen and Tie Ta had taken the first 2 places for both Class 1 Monster Cores and Class 2 Monster Cores, and thus earned twice the amount of rewards. Third place for Class 1 Monster Cores was still Mu Tian, and third place for Class 2 Monster Cores was Kargath Academy\u2019s number one expert, Bogadi.After the awards ceremony had finished, Jian Chen could not help but smile excitedly at the surging, pure power in the Class 4 Monster Core he held in his hand. With the Class 4 Monster Core, as well as the 200+ monster cores in his Space Belt, he had enough to last him for a long time. Based on Jian Chen\u2019s calculations, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about not having monster cores to use for at least a year.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During the past 3 days of fighting against the magical beasts in the forest, almost all of the students had numerous injuries. Now that the award ceremony was over, everyone returned back to their own dorms to treat their injuries. The only people left in the sports field were the completely uninjured students that had given up on the task ages ago.However, after experiencing this event, Jian Chen\u2019s and Tie Ta\u2019s reputations in Kargath Academy had reached its peak form. They had already become the greatest stars in the academy; no matter where one went, their names could be heard being discussed.Jian Chen and Tie Ta, as well as Changyang Hu\u2019s group of three, bid each other farewell, and returned to their own dorms to treat their injuries as well.In the center of the academy was a tall tower around 100 square meters large. Vice headmaster Chang Bai En was currently respectfully standing in the center of a room on the top of the tower. In front of him sat Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster, lazily sitting in front of the office desk, with a smiling expression. His profound gaze also had hints of happiness and excitement reflected in them.\u201cAh, Bai En, it seems that a genius really has appeared in Kargath Academy this time.\u201d The headmaster excitedly said with a smile.Vice headmaster Chang Bai En nodded and smiled back, \u201cHeadmaster, that is not correct. This time, Kargath Academy has more than one genius; rather there are two. These two are Changyang Xiang Tian and Tie Ta.\u201dThe headmaster shook his head and smiled, \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t wrong. Tie Ta\u2019s talent is definitely extremely high, and he also has godly strength. However, compared to Changyang Xiang Tian, he still has a long ways to go.\u201dVice headmaster Chang Bai En was surprised at this response, and he asked doubtfully, \u201cHeadmaster, why do you say that?\u201dThe headmaster let out a long sigh and said, \u201cYou definitely cannot underestimate Changyang Xiang Tian. He is quite a complicated person; no wonder the old fellow at Changyang clan kept praising him.\u201d\u201cActually, yesterday afternoon, after I had heard the news that Changyang Xiang Tian and Tie Ta had killed a Class 2 Magical Beast in the 3rd region, I personally rushed over myself to secretly watch them. Although those 2 aren\u2019t Saints yet, their combat abilities cannot be underestimated. Especially Changyang Xiang Tian, with just a broken iron rod, he was pretty much invincible in the 3rd region. Not only are his movements incomparably fast, they are also extremely precise. His battle experience is not anything alike to a 15 year old youth\u2019s; on the contrary, it seems as if he\u2019s a person that has fought 100 battles already. The Class 2 Monster Cores in the two\u2019s hands were pretty much completely killed by Changyang Xiang Tian alone. Tie Ta was simply involved in the fights.\u201dHearing this, the vice headmaster Chang Bai En\u2019s gave an incredulous look and asked, \u201cHeadmaster, is Changyang Xiang Tian really as formidable as you say?\u201dThe headmaster nodded and said, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t personally witnessed it, I wouldn\u2019t believe that a 15 year old could have such powerful strength either. The most important part is his extensive battle experience and combat techniques. These are not something that can be learned just because one wants to learn it. Without experiencing hundreds of battles, these concepts just cannot be grasped. It\u2019s no wonder that old man Chang praised Changyang Xiang Tian so much; he really is an extremely talented genius. It seems these things were all taught by the old man.\u201dThe vice headmaster Chang Bai En looked relieved as he said, \u201cUnder the great master Chang\u2019s guidance, Changyang Xiang Tian would find it difficult to not be renowned.\u201dThe headmaster nodded and said, \u201cEven if old man Chang is guiding from the sidelines, if Changyang Xiang Tian didn\u2019t originally have such outstanding talent, then even old man Chang wouldn\u2019t be able to teach him much, even under careful teaching. If Changyang Xiang Tian wasn\u2019t Changyang clan\u2019s fourth master, I would really make him my apprentice. After all, such geniuses are rare. If he continues to mature like this, it would be fortunate for Gesun Kingdom.\u201d\u2026\u2026.After the awards ceremony, Jian Chen retrieved a new uniform and then took a shower to completely wash off all of the filth on his body that he had gained from the few days in the forest. After he wore the brand new uniform, he felt refreshed as he headed back the dorm. Although he had battled virtually every single moment during his 3 days in the forest, he didn\u2019t show any traces of exhaustion. In his previous world, he had experienced even worse conditions.After returning to his room, Jian Chen sat cross-legged on his bed. He held a Class 1 Monster Core in each hand, and began to cultivate. Although Jian Chen\u2019s power had already reached the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer, he could clearly sense that the Saint Force in his body had not yet reached a state of saturation.As he gradually began to absorb the energy within the monster cores, Jian Chen\u2019s Saint Force once again quickly rose. His speed of cultivation was ten times faster than when he absorbed World Essence.For the next three days, aside from eating meals, Jian Chen used all of his time to cultivate in his room. Eventually, the Saint Force inside him had already reached a saturated state; no matter how much further Jian Chen tried to absorb the monster cores\u2019 energies, his inner Saint Force would no longer continue to grow.Jian Chen clearly understood that he needed to rush to Saint level and condense his Saint Weapon. Otherwise, the Saint Force within him would come to an eternal standstill.In terms of condensing Saint Weapons, Jian Chen had long since clearly learned the procedures to becoming Saint from the school library. It used the principle of condensing all inner Saint Force and slowly shaping it into a Saint Weapon. In the end, one uses their \u2018Soul\u2019 to perfectly harmonize with it. Once the inner Saint Force is completely condensed into a weapon, then a person is officially a Saint.Jian Chen didn\u2019t stop. He took out a Class 4 Monster Core from his Space Belt, preparing to use it if needed, and immediately began to condense a Saint Weapon and rush to Saint level.The Saint Force in Jian Chen\u2019s dantian was firmly contained by his \u201cSoul\u201d. In the presence of his powerful \u201cSoul\u201d, Jian Chen had absolute control over the Saint Force in his dantian. Jian Chen used his mind to control all the Saint Force within his dantian and gradually began to gather it together. Slowly, he formed it into the shape of a sword, and he finally began to compress it.Jian Chen\u2019s powerful Soul was brought over from his previous world. Since birth, it far surpassed other people\u2019s and under this power, the weak Saint Force had no way of resisting it. The Saint Force was firmly suppressed by Jian Chen, and he constantly compressed the sword-shaped Saint Force.As the Saint Force was compressed smaller and smaller, Jian Chen\u2019s dantian that was originally filled with Saint Force quickly began to lessen as well. Despite this, the strength of his Saint Force continued to rise, and the makeshift sword became clearer in form as well. Eventually, it became an extremely tiny sword within his dantian.At the same time, Jian Chen was still trying to condense it even more.Although Jian Chen had already successfully gathered and condensed his Saint Force into a sword, this didn\u2019t mean that he had already become a Saint. There was still the last and most difficult step left; this step was precisely what blocked so many people in Tian Yun Continent from becoming Saints for the rest of their lives.In this last step, he had to merge a part of his Soul into his dantian to completely condense and form the sword and create a spiritual relationship with it. At the same time, he would have to completely harmonize with the Saint Weapon. Although this seemed simple, it was extremely difficult to do in reality.Although this step was difficult for most people, to those that had incomparably strong Souls like Jian Chen, this was something that could be smoothly performed. Jian Chen directly split a part of his Soul and began to merge it with the condensed Saint Weapon in his dantian. He then used his practiced control to quickly link the two together. Eventually, the two had completely harmonized; they were no longer separate entities.It was at this moment that Jian Chen had finally become a legitimate Saint. This last step had provided absolutely no obstruction to him.Just as Jian Chen had perfectly harmonized his Soul and his Saint Weapon, he suddenly felt something strange, as if the condensed sword within him had become his own limb. He could easily control it, and he could also clearly sense every single component of this sword.Right now, Jian Chen\u2019s dantian didn\u2019t have a single trace of Saint Force remaining inside it. The only thing left was the condensed sword, which acted as the new energy source. The sword seemed extremely tiny; from its width and length, it didn\u2019t seem very different from an embroidery needle.Now that he had condensed his Saint Weapon, Jian Chen could sense the powerful fluctuations from Saint Weapons far clearer than he had before. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that as an ordinary Saint, he could easily defeat a person at the peak of the 10th Saint Force layer. Unless some unexpected or special circumstances occurred, a person at the peak of the 10th layer would absolutely be no match for a Saint.Both Jian Chen and Tie Ta were amazing. With Tie Ta\u2019s godly strength, as well as his extremely powerful body, even Jian Chen who had been training Saint Force since he was young was naturally not as powerful as Tie Ta. Tie Ta\u2019s abnormal strength in addition to his formidable defense was enough to make up for any lack of Saint Force. Unless the difference in strength was extremely large, there was no way he could be a match against Tie Ta. At most, they would be stuck at a standstill.Jian Chen had previously used his power at the peak 10th layer to defeat a middle ranked Saint. Although he had completely relied on the experience and battle techniques from his past world, Jian Chen\u2019s quick sword techniques and his high accomplishments in the ways of the sword, as well as his fighting willpower gained from countless experiences from life-or-death battles in his previous world were enough to make him invincible to those at the same level as him. In addition, battles with ranks higher than him weren\u2019t even worth mentioning either.At this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s expression suddenly changed. Immediately following, his dantian had surprisingly begun to tremble once more. His entire dantian began to fluctuate intensely in an unstable way. As soon as it began fluctuating, before Jian Chen could react, the World Essence began to frantically burst forth. The countless surrounding World Essence seemed to have been affected by some invisible attractive force, and gradually began to gather where Jian Chen was. At this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s body seemed to have left his control, and it felt as though all of his pores had suddenly opened. They frantically began absorbing the dense World Essence surrounding him.The energy within the Monster Core in Jain Chen\u2019s hand also fiercely dropped, forming a stream of energy visible to the naked eye which flowed into Jian Chen\u2019s body.At this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s body was like a bottomless pit. It didn\u2019t matter how strong the World Essence around him was, it was completely absorbed into his body like a whale swallowing water. At the same time, the energy of the Class four Monster Core in his hand rapidly diminished, and the speed at which it was being absorbed was unbelievable. The originally fist sized Monster Core was shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since he had lost total control over his body, he was completely unable to stop the absorption of the World Essence around him. Feeling his own body absorbing the World Essence at such a frightening speed, Jian Chen still maintained a determination of steel despite feeling slightly pressed for time. If his body continued to absorb the World Essence at this rate, it was unknown how much longer his body would be able to last before it exploded from the sudden increase of concentrated Qi. But what puzzled Jian Chen the most was that he had no idea how this happened to begin with. Why did his dantian suddenly start to absorb the World Essence out of the blue at such a remarkable speed? This left Jian Chen with no small amount of terror.He knew in his heart that the World Essence around him was rapidly congregating and the area around him became like a storm as it flowed at a frantic speed. The gale of Qi roared and whistled throughout Kargath Academy as both leaves and loose rocks were sent flying into the air.But when the World Essence\u00a0entered Jian Chen\u2019s dantian, it was as if he threw a rock into the ocean, as the World Essence assimilated into his body leaving no indication that it was there to begin with. For that reason, Jian Chen let out a sigh of relief. Although he didn\u2019t know what had caused his dantian to go through such a dramatic change, he was glad that his body wouldn\u2019t explode from the World Essence.At the same time within the high central tower of Kargath Academy, the headmaster of the academy suddenly cried out in shock, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? The World Essence is fluctuating in such a violent way!\u201d As he spoke, the headmaster had already flew out of the window, leaving behind an after image. The moment he flew through the window, he soared into the sky at an extreme speed and immediately found himself at the dorm room of Jian Chen after a few seconds. He looked at the dorm with doubt and puzzlement as he continue to stare at the room.Meanwhile, a streak of white light came blurring over and stopped a few hundred meters behind the headmaster. It was the vice headmaster, Bai En.Even after the arrival of Bai En, another dozen people came flying over in rapid succession before coming to a stop behind Bai En to look at where the World Essence was congregating at.They were all teachers of the academy with strength stronger than most, and so with the violent fluctuations of the World Essence, there would be no way at all for them to not notice.Bai En looked at the amassed World Essence with amazement as he cried out in wonder, \u201cHeadmaster, what has happened here? Why has the World Essence gathered itself in this area?\u201dAlthough the headmaster\u2019s face looked focused, his eyes were staring blankly as he replied, \u201cEven I don\u2019t know what has happened here, let\u2019s go find out.\u201dWith that, the headmaster plummeted down to the ground with Bai En following right behind him.\u201cThe rest of you stay here, do not allow anyone else to come close.\u201d He called out to the teachers.All the teachers wanted to follow the headmaster to find out the answer to this mystery, but with the words of Bai En, the teachers stopped their initial momentum and returned to their original spots obediently. When it came to Bai En, no teacher dared to violate his commands.Quickly, both the headmaster and Bai En arrived outside of the door to Jian Chen\u2019s room, where the World Essence was inside.As Bai En silently knocked onto the door, it suddenly smashed into pieces and the scene inside was projected towards the two.Inside, they saw Jian Chen sitting crossed legged on his bed with his eyes closed as he continued to cultivate. The World Essence was still being absorbed into his dantian with such a terrifying speed that it made his body outline blurry as a fog concealed him slightly.Seeing this phenomenon, both Bai En and the headmaster were speechless. They never would have thought that the World Essence being concentrated here was because of a single person\u2019s cultivation. Not only that, but they were stunned by the amazing speed at which Jian Chen was absorbing the World Essence.\u201cSo it was Changyang Xiang Tian! How\u2026how could this be possible, with his strength, how could he bring about such an effect like this?\u201d Bai En cried out in shock as he watched what was inconceivable to him.Even the headmaster was trembling as his eyes stared deeply at Jian Chen. After a good while, he let out a sigh, \u201cThis kid is not ordinary at all!\u201dHearing the headmaster, Bai En nodded his head in complete belief in the headmaster. In his heart, he had always known that Jian Chen was never an ordinary student.\u201cHeadmaster, what should we do now then?\u201d He asked.\u201cWe wait!\u201d Came the reply.And so, the headmaster and vice headmaster stood outside Jian Chen\u2019s room and waited for him to reawaken. They didn\u2019t enter his room, and didn\u2019t make a sound almost as if they were afraid of accidentally disturbing the cultivating Jian Chen.Jian Chen had long since been aware that his door had been smashed apart, but he wasn\u2019t able to move both his body and mouth since he wasn\u2019t in control. And the Class 4 Monster Core gripped tightly in his hand was visibly smaller now to the naked eye, its size already roughly the same size of a ping pong ball.All of the energy and World Essence that was being absorbed into Jian Chen\u2019s dantian disappeared like a stone falling into the ocean without leaving behind a single ripple of water behind.Regarding this situation within his dantian, Jian Chen was absolutely clueless and didn\u2019t understand where all of the World Essence was going.Soon after some time had passed, the energy in the Class 4 Monster Core was completely absorbed by him. Finally within his dantian a change was happening as light specks of both\u00a0azure and violet\u00a0started to appear. The moment the specks appeared, his dantian suddenly started to absorb the World Essence at an even faster rate, and even started to absorb World Essence from a farther distance. With the azure and violet\u00a0light specks, World Essence\u00a0from a dozen feet away felt the pull and began to rush towards Jian Chen before being absorbed through the pores in his body and into the glowing specks.Because of Jian Chen\u2019s fast absorption rate of the World Essence, a faint white mist was clearly noticeable to the naked eye as it surrounded him. Because of this white mist, his own body was only faintly discernible, making both him and the area around him seem much more mysterious than before.The increase in the rate of absorption did not go unnoticed by the two men standing outside of the door. Staring at each other in the eye, they were both astonished at what they were both seeing.By this point, the entire Kargath Academy was aware of the sudden influx of World Essence, but aside from the teachers, each and every student took it to be a sudden gust of wind, and took no more notice to it.Jian Chen\u2019s dantian continued to absorb the World Essence for half the day before finally stopping. Jian Chen completely absorbed all of the World Essence dozens of kilometers away. At the moment, aside from the completed sword made from his condensed Saint Force, Jian Chen\u2019s dantian also contained\u00a0azure and violet\u00a0specks of light. The specks were extremely small, and they had extremely faint glows as well. The way they flickered made it seem like they would burn out at any moment.Probing the azure and violet\u00a0specks of light that had just appeared within his dantian, Jian Chen\u2019s heart momentarily grew heavy. This was the first time he had ever encountered an uncontrollable circumstance within the dantian. He had no desire to encounter such an issue. However, what he could say for certain was that these azure and violet\u00a0light specks were definitely related to the uncontrollably crazy absorption of the World Essence that he had experienced earlier.\u201cCould it be that these azure and violet\u00a0lights are completely made of the World Essence from before?\u201d Jian Chen secretly guessed. The great amount of World Essence that had entered his dantian before had completely disappeared without a trace, like a rock in the large sea. This was something completely unfathomable. In addition, after absorbing that vast amount of World Essence, these strange light specks had appeared within his dantian. This made it obvious to Jian Chen that the two events were connected.However, what made Jian Chen really doubtful and worried was the question: what exactly were those strange light specks within his dantian, and what did they do? Would their existence be of any harm to him? These were the questions Jian Chen was currently most concerned about. The latter question particularly, made him feel unrest.After hesitating for a bit, Jian Chen finally tried attempting to control the azure and violet\u00a0lights. However, after a few experiments, his mood became more and more serious. After some internal inspections, although he could clearly \u201csee\u201d the specks of light, every time he tried to manipulate them, he would suddenly discover that the light specks existing within his dantian would become similar to mirages. He could easily pass through them, and was completely unable to grab ahold of them and put them under his control. It was as if they didn\u2019t really exist.To every cultivating person, the dantian was an extremely important part of the body. Jian Chen definitely did not wish to see his dantian go through some situation beyond his control. Otherwise, for all he knew, it could prove to be fatal during some critical moment later.\u201cAi, whatever. Whether it\u2019s good or bad, it\u2019s not like I can do anything about it. I\u2019m a person who has died once already anyways. Why should I care about these things?\u201d Jian Chen soon came to the conclusion that he wouldn\u2019t bother toiling over the strange changes in his dantian any longer. Since the circumstances were beyond his control, he could only calmly accept them.Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes, his gaze perfectly calm. Although successfully becoming a Saint was an exciting achievement, because an uncontrollable circumstance had occurred within his dantian, he could not bring himself to be happy.Just as Jian Chen opened his eyes, the headmaster and vice headmaster that had been waiting outside the whole time walked in together.Seeing the headmaster walk in, Jian Chen quickly got off the bed and greeted them, \u201cHeadmaster, Vice Headmaster.\u201dThe headmaster had a wide smile across his face as he steadily looked at Jian Chen. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, the World Essence you just released was abnormal. Did you encounter any problems during your cultivation? If so, don\u2019t hold yourself back and tell me. Perhaps I can help you.\u201d The headmaster said in a tone of great concern.\u201cThank you for your concern, Headmaster. Everything has been going well, as I haven\u2019t yet encountered any problems.\u201d Jian Chen calmly said. He didn\u2019t think his dantian situation was something that the headmaster could resolve. Saying it would only stir up trouble, and it was better to just stay silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, he had personally seen such a tremendous amount of World Essence be absorbed by him. Although he didn\u2019t know what type of method Jian Chen had used to absorb it all, but he at the very least understood that after absorbing this much World Essence, there was no way Jian Chen would only be at the Primary Saint level.To see Jian Chen immediately cross over the Primary level to the Middle level of Sainthood, the headmaster couldn\u2019t help but be extremely happy. With this, his Kargath Academy could finally be proud of having such a talented student.\u201cHeadmaster, I\u2019ve only just condensed a Saint Weapon, so my strength should definitely be at the Primary level.\u201d Jian Chen knew that the headmaster believed he had completely absorbed all of the World Essence and asked him this question for that reason.\u201cPrimary level!\u201d A voice cried. This time it wasn\u2019t the headmaster who spoke, but Bai En who was standing behind him with a look of disbelief.\u201cHow could that be, you\u2019ve absorbed such an enormous amount of World Essence, so how could you only be at the Primary Saint level?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face let out a bitter smile. He didn\u2019t intend to reveal the things that happened in his own dantian.\u201cOkay, since Changyang Xiang Tian is fine, then we should leave.\u201d The headmaster\u2019s gaze was directed at Jian Chen as he said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, right now you have just become a Saint, and you should properly familiarize yourself with your Saint Weapon\u2019s uses.\u201d After saying these words, the two people, headmaster and vice-headmaster, left Jian Chen\u2019s room.After leaving the dormitories, vice-headmaster Bai En with a face full of curiosity asked, \u201cHeadmaster, Changyang Xiang Tian obviously absorbed a colossal amount of World Essence, how could he still only stay at the Primary Saint level, this just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dWhen he heard this, the headmaster slightly nodded his head and said, \u201cYes, it certainly doesn\u2019t abide to common sense, or there might be a secret Changyang Xiang Tian has that we do not know of. Otherwise, how could he absorb all the World Essence dozens kilometers away? It\u2019s obviously an impossible task.\u201d After saying this, the headmaster paused for a moment, then continued, \u201cThis matter is something that we should not pry into. From now on, for any matters concerning Changyang Xiang Tian, as long as it doesn\u2019t cause too much of a ruckus, we shouldn\u2019t interfere. Let him grow as he wishes, as a genius\u2019 path is usually made by himself. If they don\u2019t weather the storm, they will never truly grow, and with only peaceful times, they will eventually wane.\u201d\u201cYes, Bai En understands.\u201d the vice headmaster answered respectfully. His mind was clear, in order to cultivate a genius, this would do whatever Kargath Academy would have to do.The headmaster stared off into the azure sky as he muttered to himself, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian is 15 years old this year; to reach Sainthood by his 15th year would cause quite a shock throughout the Tian Yuan continent. It really does look like Changyang Xiang Tian is a true genius, so I truly hope he continues down his path and does not die a premature death. Otherwise, this would be a heavy loss for our Gesun Kingdom. Ai, it\u2019s a shame the ancestor of the Changyang Clan has been missing for a hundred years, if he was still alive, then his plan might have succeeded.\u201d\u2026\u2026.After the headmaster left, Jian Chen continued to sit cross legged on the bed once more and observed the azure and violet\u00a0glow within his dantian. He let out a sigh, not only did he not know what was the matter with the glows, but he also had no control over them.With another sigh, Jian Chen decided to forget about them since it would waste precious time if he did. He had already died once and already experienced many things. Aside from the maternal love he felt for his mother Bi Yun Tian, there wasn\u2019t much else Jian Chen cared about.Jian Chen sucked in a deep breath and slowly calmed himself. Concentrating deeply on his right hand, his heart thumped before a strong source of energy flashed as a slender longsword appeared in his right hand.The longsword was unusually thin and the entire body was a silver white almost like a mirror that reflected the surrounding area on the blade.The sword was around 4 feet long and two fingers wide. Engraved on the blade next to the hilt were two words: \u201cLight Wind\u201d.This sword\u2019s appearance was almost exactly like Jian Chen\u2019s treasured sword in his previous life. Even the name itself was the exact same one, called the Light Wind Sword.Jian Chen\u2019s way of the sword placed a strong emphasis on quickness and agility. With the ability to strike in a thousand different ways, he was like the wind that \u2018came in without a shadow, and left without a footprint\u2019.Holding onto the Light Wind Sword, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but smile tremendously. At the moment where he grasped onto the sword, he felt the familiarity he had with his previous world come rushing back to him.However, the only difference was that Jian Chen felt that the sword was like an extension of his arm; he didn\u2019t need to expend as much strength to control it. Jian Chen could also feel his \u201cSoul\u201d connecting with the sword to establish a perfect relationship between the two. The two were one and no longer divided. This was a feeling he had never felt before in his previous world.Jian Chen jabbed out with his sword, letting the silver blade flash as it shot outwards.\u201cDing!\u201d A clear sound was heard as the Light Wind Sword whistled in the air. It would appear that this sword was on the same level as the ones refined from the finest of iron.Jian Chen gently caressed the blade with his left hand joyfully as if the sword was his most favorite person.To any true swordsman, the sword was the the item they were the most fond of and could not replace. The sword was their life and their soul, and Jian Chen was a firm believer of that as well.When Jian Chen summoned the Light Wind Sword, it had disappeared from within his dantian and the energy had been completely concentrated onto his hand to form the blade in real life. Not only was this sword able to deal out major damage, but this was also the source of Jian Chen\u2019s energy and replaced his dantian as the source.Jian Chen\u2019s heart thumped once more as the sword started to disappear and return to his dantian as the mini version of the Light Wind Sword.Two days after Jian Chen had broken through to Sainthood, he had spent the time observing the two colored glows within his dantian. Other than that, he spent most of the time in the library in order to find a book that would help shed some light on the situation with his dantian\u2013however, he always came up empty handed.During those two days, Jian Chen\u2019s breakthrough to Sainthood had been passed around through the academy like a great wave since they all knew Jian Chen had gotten to that level too fast. Every student at Kargath Academy knew that he had joined the academy a few months ago at the 8th Saint Force layer. And after those few months, he had suddenly broken through to become a Saint, this type of cultivation speed was far too fast, causing everyone to cry out in astonishment. This record had completely squashed out the previous number 1 cultivation genius Cheng Ming Xiang.Far away from Kargath Academy in a splendid dazzling palace, a jewel embedded robe wearing middle aged man sat in the middle of the study room while reading a book.\u201cYour majesty, a message courier has arrived.\u201d A respectful but deep voice called out from outside the room.Hearing that, the middle aged man slowly put down his book and looked towards the entrance of his room. \u201cCome in.\u201d He stated. This middle aged man was the emperor of the Gesun Kingdom\u2013Ka De Sen.As the emperor spoke, the doors to the study room opened, and a man wearing a black pao entered. He was approximately 30 years old and quickly walked into the room; when he was within 30 steps away from the emperor he immediately stopped where he was and knelt down onto his knees, \u201cYour majesty, a letter just came from headmaster Ka Fei Er in Kargath Academy.\u201dOriginally, the emperor didn\u2019t care at all for the letter, but the moment he had heard the name Ka Fei Er, his face immediately grew solemn and placed the book down onto the table. \u201cBring me the message now.\u201d\u201cYes! Your Majesty!\u201d A nearby bodyguard standing next to the emperor respectfully responded. He immediately took the letter in his hand, and closely inspected it. Only after confirming there were no problems with it did he walk up and hand it over to the emperor.The emperor took the letter and immediately opened it. His calm face gradually began to form a smile, as he murmured, \u201cThis Changyang Xiang Tian is indeed a heavenly genius. Not only did he defeat a Saint while being at the 8th Saint Force layer, he also managed to defeat a middle-ranked Saint when he was only at the 10th layer. Moreover, he had successfully condensed his Saint Weapon at the age of 15. This is definitely a genius; it\u2019s no wonder that he received so much praise from Uncle. With Uncle\u2019s insight, he naturally can distinguish certain people. If Uncle recommends Changyang Xiang Tian to this extent, then I should be doing something about it as well.\u201d\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian has the Changyang clan backing him, even more so since he\u2019s the fourth master. It looks like getting ahold of him will be impossible. In that case, I can only try my hardest to seduce him. Although the Changyang clan has already been silent for a dozen years, the inside information about their clan is still true; their strength cannot be underestimated, and is enough for me to act. Since it is so, I\u2019ll just do this.\u201d The emperor seemed to have decided on something as he immediately said, \u201cServants, fetch me pen and ink.\u201dSoon afterwards, the chamberlain arrived with the pen and ink ready. The emperor grasped the pen and began to smoothly write out his words. He delicately picked up the paper and reread the words written on it, before slowly folding it up and leaving the study.With the scroll in hand, the emperor was escorted by a group of guards sticking tightly to him through layers after layers of halls, before finally entering a beautiful courtyard.When the emperor had just stepped into the courtyard, a 50-60 year old elder came out from a room within the courtyard. He calmly looked at the emperor and smiled, \u201cSo it was Your Majesty that had arrived. Please come in.\u201dThe emperor walked up to the elder, not yet entering the room. He handed the scroll in his hand to the elder, and solemnly said, \u201cSenior Ye Ming, this is an extremely important letter that I want you to personally deliver to Lore City\u2019s Changyang clan.\u201dHearing this, the elder\u2019s face grew more serious. He reached out to receive the scroll from the emperor\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYour Majesty, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely deliver this letter.\u201d The elder clearly understood that since he was being sent to personally deliver the letter, it definitely was not just about a simple matter.After the letter in his hand was sent out, the emperor inwardly sighed, as he thought to himself, \u201cYue Er, for the sake of our kingdom\u2019s development, for the sake of our kingdom\u2019s future, your father has no choice but to sacrifice you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had not been cultivating for the past 2 days, and instead was spending his days at the library reading books. Every night, he immersed himself with trying to understand the sword within his dantian, in order to learn to use his Saint Weapon as efficiently as possible.After all, Jian Chen had only recently broken through to Sainthood, and even though the Saint Weapon within him was connected to his mind, he still didn\u2019t know how to use the Saint Weapon to perfection. Jian Chen, who had experience from the previous world, still found the Saint Weapon in this world a fresh new experience. If he didn\u2019t spend his time familiarizing himself with it, then even connecting his soul with his Saint Weapon like he did with the tree branch, it would still be very hard to show off the pinnacle of his strength.The reason for this was the same as a person had a severed arm for ten to twenty years, but the arm suddenly grew back. Since that person was familiar with living with a severed arm and now had to face the newly grown arm, they would also be a bit unfamiliar to his condition. This development required time to slowly accept and become comfortable with.Standing up from his bed, Jian Chen walked out of his room and headed towards the dining halls. Then as per usual, after eating, he headed to the library.The doors to the library were already open, but there weren\u2019t many people inside; just the regular janitorial lady.Jian Chen looked at the nearly empty library and then walked towards the 5th level of the library. For the past few days, all of the books he had been interested in, from the first to fourth level, have all been completely read by him.The library had a total of 7 levels. The first two levels could be accessed by anyone below the Saint level while the 3rd and 4th levels would be opened to those who broke through to the Saint level. The 5th level of the library wasn\u2019t open to any student except for the Freshman Champion, so for those who wanted to read the books from that level, they would have to be a teacher from the academy. The 6th and 7th layer of the library was protected by very strong bindings, and only the headmaster and vice headmaster could enter. For those who wanted to enter, they would need the strict approval of either the headmaster or vice headmaster first.Even though the fifth story of the library wasn\u2019t open to the students, Jian Chen, who had achieved the first place in the Freshman Competition, could freely enter the fifth level.The amount of space the fifth level occupied wasn\u2019t really that big, and the number of books weren\u2019t very many either. If you added them all up, the number was barely a hundred, which was incomparable to the ten thousands of books that the first level had.But Jian Chen knew that any one of these hundred books, had a value far greater than any of the books he had ever read before.The fifth level of the library was very quiet. Although not many people visited it, Jian Chen could see that this place was cleaned by someone very often. The entire room was clean; one wouldn\u2019t be able to find a single speck of dust in it.Jian Chen walked towards the bookshelves and selected a book on cultivation before walking back towards the table. The contents of the book were only about cultivation. Although he didn\u2019t know if the contents of the book would help him with his problem, it would at least enrich his mind with other information he deemed helpful.Jian Chen was extremely invested in reading, to the point of addiction. Although the information recorded inside the book had almost nothing that could help him, it still helped open his eyes and broadened his horizons to a whole new world of cultivation. The information he saw was about things he could never think about before in his past life.The information on cultivation written inside the book wasn\u2019t too profound and only had a few dozen pages, so he quickly finished the book. After reading it, Jian Chen placed the book back onto the bookshelves and started to mutter to himself, as if he was trying to commit the knowledge to memory.After carefully putting the book back in its original location, Jian Chen grabbed another book and started to repeat the process of reading once more. Within the 5th level of the library, practically all of the books were left behind by predecessors to help people with cultivation techniques. However, the majority of these cultivation techniques were not too strong; most of them were barely above the Primary Earth Tier level.The time slowly went by, as Jian Chen resided on the 5th level to read book after book. He had completely forgotten about the time, he hadn\u2019t noticed that he was no longer alone, as two other middle aged men appeared. Just one look at the two was enough to tell that these were teachers of the academy.The two middle-aged men appeared to know Jian Chen; when they saw him, their eyes let out a very surprised look. However, they did not make a sound to avoid disturbing him.Just then, an old man wearing a light blue and luxurious chang pao walked up from below. He looked to be in his fifties or sixties. His hair was as white as a crane but his appearance was like that of a young man. He had a mysterious expression that constantly flashed in his eyes.The 5th level of the library wasn\u2019t too big, and so after the elderly man entered the 5th level of the library, he promptly walked to the side to get to the staircase that would lead to the 6th layer. All of a sudden, he had noticed a young child out of the corner of his eye.The elderly man came to a sudden stop as he sized up the child in his head. Immediately recognizing the academy uniform on the tall but slender child, he realized with a start, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian!\u201dJian Chen was immediately brought back to his senses and looked back to the old man who had called him. His face was a little sluggish before he jolted to his feet with a smile, \u201cHeadmaster, why have you come here?\u201dThis man was the headmaster of Kargath Academy.The headmaster\u2019s voice had simultaneously startled the two teachers. The moment they saw the headmaster, they looked startled and placed their books down onto the table before standing up. Cupping their hands to salute the headmaster, they called out respectfully, \u201cWe greet the headmaster.\u201dThe headmaster of Kargath Academy was a well known figure whose name resounded throughout the Gesun Kingdom. His strength was on the level of a Heaven Saint Master, and he was one of the 6 strongest individuals of the Gesun Kingdom.A Heaven Saint Master on the Tian Yuan Continent was still regarded as a very strong and valiant person.The headmaster\u2019s gaze swept across the two middle aged men and waved his hand as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, please continue reading your books.\u201d\u201cYes, headmaster.\u201d The two middle aged men immediately sat down again, though they didn\u2019t have the spirit to concentrate on the books in their hands.The headmaster\u2019s eyes glanced over the book within Jian Chen\u2019s hand. With a smile as he nodded his head in satisfaction, he said with a gratified tone, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, do you like this library?\u201dJian Chen nodded his head without hesitation, \u201cThat\u2019s right; from this library, I can learn many different things. Even if the information here provides little to no help to someone, it\u2019ll still increase one\u2019s knowledge.\u201dHearing Jian Chen, the headmaster looked at him with admiration. \u201cGood, good. Changyang Xiang Tian, someone with your understanding and logic is hard to come by. Since you enjoy being in this library, then let me help you. Come with me.\u201d Turning around, the headmaster started to walk towards the stairway to the 6th level.Seeing the direction that the headmaster was heading in, Jian Chen fully understood the old man\u2019s meaning and was overjoyed. He immediately returned the book in his hand to the original position and followed behind the headmaster toward the sixth level of the library.Seeing Jian Chen disappear off into the staircase, the two teachers looked at his direction with some envy. The 6th and 7th levels of the library could only be accessed by the headmaster and the vice headmaster. Those who wanted access needed the approval of one of the two first. When it came to the 6th and 7th levels of the library, these were the areas that every single teacher of the academy wanted to go to, mostly because those two levels contained high level techniques. Not only that, but the other books in that level had rich information pertaining to many other fields. Most importantly, on the 6th and 7th levels of the library, there were records of many of the different types of spiritual treasures on the Tian Yuan Continent.Very quickly, Jian Chen followed the headmaster to the entrance of the sixth level. Jian Chen could clearly see the transparent bindings keeping the door shut.\u201cThe bindings of the sixth level and the seventh level are all arranged by the previous generations of headmasters. The defence is very strong, and even if it is a Heaven Saint Master, it is impossible to break it within a short period of time.\u201d The headmaster\u2019s tone carried a bit a pride, and he immediately took out a token constructed from Purple Coin. The token had very complicated markings on it, and it seemed to be a design of some sort.The Purple Coin token in the headmaster\u2019s hands released a faint purple glow, and soon the purple glow grew more and more bright. At last, a ray of light like a material substance shot out and directly landed on the bindings.The transparent bindings slowly rippled twice like water, and the center slowly split apart to form a large hole that a person could easily enter through\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, follow me inside.\u201d The headmaster called out to Jian Chen, and directly walked inside.Jian Chen followed behind the headmaster, and they walked straight through the sixth level onto the seventh level. The library\u2019s seventh level was very empty. It was only the size of a typical room, and there was a single wooden table placed in the center. In front of the table was a small bookshelf that had a few thin books. There were two boxes on top of the bookshelf; one of the boxes was completely made of extremely precious jade, while the other was entirely made of Purple Coin. Both of their values were not at all lacking, and it could be seen that the items within these boxes had to be extremely important.\u201cEver since Kargath Academy was first established, this library has always existed. Up until now, it\u2019s been here for hundreds of years already. These past few centuries, the number of people aside from the headmaster of each era that have come to this library\u2019s seventh level hasn\u2019t been small. However, every single one of them was an extremely influential power, if not an impressive expert from the Tian Yun Continent. You are the first Kargath Academy student to have entered the seventh level these past few centuries.\u201d The headmaster explained slowly, with an extremely calm tone.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this library\u2019s seventh level is where my Kargath Academy\u2019s riches are contained. The entire seventh level is enveloped by a layer of powerful bindings. This layer of bindings were painstakingly created by the Saint Ruler, Brian, the first generation\u2019s headmaster. The items within all have special tracers; as long as the bindings aren\u2019t broken, there is no way they can be brought outside. In addition, the books inside here were all the books about cultivation methods that Headmaster Brian had collected himself, if not personally written by him. These are Kargath Academy\u2019s greatest riches.\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen\u2019s expression became extremely serious. He hadn\u2019t imagined that the library\u2019s seventh level would be so important. The fact that Kargath Academy\u2019s first generation headmaster had actually been a Saint Ruler that was an exceptional expert was also shocking to Jian Chen.The headmaster\u2019s gaze brightly looked at Jian Chen, and his expression changed and he said with a strict tone, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, right now I use my authority as the headmaster to allow you to read any book except the one inside the jade box. You only have this one chance, I hope you properly utilize it.\u201dJian Chen solemnly nodded his head, \u201cI thank the headmaster for the help.\u201d\u201cThe jade box contains items that would not be of any use to the current you, and it may even obstruct your growth. Therefore, you must not look at the items within the jade box. However, the Purple Coin box contains a Primary Heaven Tier cultivation technique that you can read however much you want. However, your Changyang clan\u2019s family heirloom Law of Yang Qi isn\u2019t any weaker than the Collecting Heart Sutra. Therefore, choosing whatever cultivation method you use isn\u2019t something you should be too hasty with.\u201d\u201cOkay, you can stay here by yourself and take your time to read them. Remember, you only have this once chance to enter the seventh floor of the library, I hope you treasure it. The bindings at the entrance will only prevent the people who are trying to enter, if you want to leave, you can leave directly.\u201d After finishing, the headmaster immediately turned and left the place, disappearing outside the bindings on the seventh floor, leaving Jian Chen standing there dazed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes swept over the shelves one by one before finally taking out a single book. He walked towards the center of the floor to a table and sat down. The book was for those who gained insights as well as techniques for breaking through a bottleneck. Even Earth Saint Masters could benefit from the notes clearly written on itAlthough there weren\u2019t many books on this level, but the quality of the content inside was of the utmost quality. If any one of these books were to be released to the common populace, then it would cause a widespread reign of carnage for it.Jian Chen slowly flipped the pages of the book one by one as he read it. Soon the book was finished off by him, causing Jian Chen to sink into meditation. Whatever book he grabbed had led to his eyes being opened wide to the world of possibilities. The cultivation system in this world had already long since toppled the system in his previous world. With this book, Jian Chen felt like he had a stronger understanding of this world\u2019s cultivation system now.Not too long after, Jian Chen had finished reading a dozen book from the shelves. Half of the books talked about insights on cultivation as well as the problems a cultivator might experience. The other half were books about cultivation techniques, but the strongest of these techniques were only at the Upper Earth Tier level. What Jian Chen had found most helpful was the personal letter from Kargath Academy\u2019s first headmaster Brian.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes swept over to the Purple Coin box; according to the headmaster, the Purple Coin box contained a Primary Heaven Tier technique. Although Jian Chen didn\u2019t have a clear idea of how valuable a Heaven Tier technique was, but he did know that it was still quite the priceless treasure.After all, the Heaven Tier techniques was the second strongest type of technique on the Tian Yuan continent. There was only one other tier higher than it\u2013Saint Tier.Jian Chen slowly opened the Purple Coin box only to see a hand sized book inside. On top of the cover of the book had words\u2013Collecting Heart Sutra written on it in bold cursive. The moment the book touched his hand, Jian Chen felt a soft sensation enter his arm. It was almost as if there was a sense of warmth to the book despite it never being touched before.The book was made of some kind of magical beast leather. It was extremely supple and strong, and hard to damage in any way.He slowly took the book out of the box and carefully started to flip through the pages to read it. He was reading it with a serious face since Jian Chen knew that such a strong cultivational technique was extremely rare to come by. Although he didn\u2019t initially plan to practice this technique, just looking at it would bring him some benefits at the very least. Though he wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to find something of value within the book to help him with his problem.4 hours later, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes finally moved away from the book as he bowed his head in contemplation. After he was sure he committed the contents of the book to memory, he returned it to the original box and then walked back to the table.His eyes looked at the bookshelves before he let out a sigh. With no small amount of regret, he began to head down the stairs, however, Jian Chen had profited greatly today in the 7th level of the library.On his way down, Jian Chen took a look at the 6th level of the library. Although the books within the 6th level was not as valuable as the 7th level, the profits in the knowledge gained from them were still great. To Jian Chen, the predecessors had imparted their knowledge and insights in those books, so the knowledge would prove to be extremely beneficial.Jian Chen had learned much about the many different spiritual treasures of the Tian Yuan continent, something that couldn\u2019t be found anywhere on the first 5 levels of the library.By the time Jian Chen had walked out of the library, the sky had already darkened. Unknowingly, he had already spent the entire day inside the library. He\u2019d even forgotten to eat.\u201cGrowl\u2026.\u201d At that moment, Jian Chen\u2019s stomach unexpectedly made a loud sound.Jian Chen reached down to rub his stomach that was currently so empty that it had begun to hurt a bit. He smiled helplessly, and then started to walk towards the dining hall.After quickly finishing his dinner, Jian Chen went straight back to the dorms. En route, he managed to attract quite a few students\u2019 gazes; there were envious, respectful, jealous, and all other types of expressions in their looks.Jian Chen didn\u2019t pay any mind to the surrounding attention, and walked to the dorm without a sideways glance. After he entered the dorms, he could see that in the distance, there was a familiar figure standing in front of his room. He felt relieved as he realized it was his older brother, Changyang Hu.\u201cIt\u2019s so late, and yet Big Brother is waiting for me to return here. Could it be he has something urgent that he really needs to tell me?\u201d Jian Chen inwardly guessed. He quickened his pace, and rushed over.\u201cBig brother, it\u2019s already so late. Why are you waiting for me here? What is there that cannot wait until tomorrow to discuss?\u201d Jian Chen asked as he walked up to Changyang Hu.Seeing Jian Chen approach, Changyang Hu\u2019s face turned bitter, and he said with a sigh, \u201cAi\u2026fourth brother, you\u2019ve finally returned. Where did you run off to today? I pretty much searched the entire school, yet I couldn\u2019t find you, so I have been waiting here for the entire day now.\u201dJian Chen said apologetically, \u201cBig brother, were you looking for me for something extremely important?\u201dHearing this, Changyang Hu smiled happily and said in an excited voice, \u201cOf course there\u2019s something. Moreover, it\u2019s something major. Come, fourth brother, let\u2019s enter the room to talk.\u201dJian Chen nodded, and took out the key from his Space Belt to open the room\u2019s door. This room\u2019s door was newly replaced, since the old one had been turned to rubble by the vice headmaster.Immediately after they entered the room, Changyang Hu closed the door, and then urgently said, \u201cFourth brother, the clan just sent a message. You\u2019re so lucky, your big brother is really envious of you.\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen was puzzled, and he asked in confusion, \u201cBig brother, exactly what has happened?\u201dChangyang Hu sat down on Jian Chen\u2019s bed, and said with a happy smile, \u201cFourth brother, I guess you don\u2019t know yet. Father has already arranged for your marriage.\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen\u2019s expression clearly became startled. After finally returning to his senses, he asked in an incredulous and shocked tone, \u201cWhat! An arranged marriage?!\u201dChangyang Hu fiercely nodded, and excitedly replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, fourth brother. Moreover, your partner is the emperor\u2019s third princess \u2014\u2014 Princess Ge Lan. I\u2019ve heard that this arranged marriage had even been the emperor\u2019s own suggestion.\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen\u2019s expression immediately grew more serious. He felt that this situation was extremely abnormal, and moreover, he hadn\u2019t agreed to it. He felt dissatisfied by the fact that his own marriage had been decided by his clan without him. Having such a fate decided by others made Jian Chen feel extremely disgusted.Seeing Jian Chen\u2019s expression, Changyang Hu thought that Jian Chen was worrying over Princess Ge Lan\u2019s appearance. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cFourth brother, don\u2019t worry. Although I\u2019ve never seen Princess Ge Lan, I\u2019ve heard quite a few things about her. Princess Ge Lan is the emperor\u2019s third daughter. She\u2019s naturally beautiful, and her looks are enough for cities to fight over her. Since she was young, she\u2019s been a gifted genius. She has not only mastered the four fine arts, she\u2019s also quite a well-known talent in cultivation. At the age of 15, Princess Ge Lan had reached the 7th Saint Force layer. She has been doted on quite a lot by the emperor; she is the emperor\u2019s beloved person, the emperor loves her dearly in every possible way.\u201dHearing this Changyang Hu sighed, \u201cPrincess Ge Lan\u2019s identity isn\u2019t her only good point. With just her gift at cultivation, even your own older brother couldn\u2019t compete with her. Fourth Brother, His Majesty has betrothed the princess to you; this is a stroke of good fortune, so don\u2019t have such a sour look on your face.\u201dJian Chen could only let out a sigh inwardly, Changyang Hu couldn\u2019t understand his thoughts at all. Despite Princess Ge Lan\u2019s beauty, Jian Chen wasn\u2019t moved at all. All he wanted to do right now was to improve his own strength, he couldn\u2019t afford to waste time with a girl at the moment. Jian Chen also knew that the emperor was aware of his own achievements within Kargath Academy, otherwise, there was no way the emperor would have been so firm on his decision to betroth his daughter to him.Because this arranged marriage was proposed by the emperor, Jian Chen was absolutely powerless to go against the marriage. His parents wouldn\u2019t even dare to give up the chance to establish a friendship with the royal family, let alone a relationship with them. Aside from the emperor taking back the proposal, there would be no way for Jian Chen to refuse it, so he would have to quietly accept it.The only thing that put Jian Chen to ease was the fact that this decision was only just recently made. The official date for the marriage had not yet been announced, meaning the marriage was being put off indefinitely for the time being. This gave him a good time period to breathe. Jian Chen after all did not want to talk about this at all; in his previous life, Jian Chen was a wanderer who loved traveling around the world. Without a permanent residence to live in and using the mother earth as his bed, with another person by his side, he wouldn\u2019t be able to continue to that lifestyle anymore.After Changyang Hu left, Jian Chen sat on the bed by himself and contemplated deeply. One had to admit that the news from his clan had been too sudden, catching Jian Chen unprepared.\u201cAi, I might as well spend the rest of my time cultivating. Power in the end decides everything after all. When my strength grows strong enough, even the emperor would not be able to say anything.\u201d Jian Chen sighed as he continued to cultivate.Jian Chen took out a Class 1 Monster Core from the pile of them within his Space Ring. He slowly closed his eyes, and began to absorb the power from within the monster core to cultivate it. Ever since he had broken through Sainthood 2 days ago, this was the first time he was cultivating. The past 2 evenings, he had been familiarizing himself with how to use and control the Saint Weapon.Just as Jian Chen started to absorb the energy from within the monster cores, the speed in which the monster core was being absorbed from him was growing faster and faster; almost as if all control was lost as the energy rushed into him. As the energy frantically rushed into him, the rate had instantly increased to a speed several hundred times faster than normal.The sudden rush in cultivation speed caused Jian Chen\u2019s face to twitch in surprise. Although every cultivator greatly desired for their cultivation speed to be increased, but Jian Chen\u2019s cultivation speed had already reached a frightening level. With this absorption rate of the energy from the monster core, Jian Chen simply didn\u2019t have enough time to refine it which serve no purpose for him at all since energy that wasn\u2019t refined by him was not controllable and would only serve to rebel against him within his own body. An end result like that would lead to consequences in which Jian Chen would have a tough time resolving.Jian Chen immediately stopped absorbing the power from the monster core. The only thing worth rejoicing about was that his process of stopping his absorption of the monster core\u2019s energy had gone very smoothly. No frightening and uncontrollable scene had occurred. Otherwise, he was afraid that he really would\u2019ve gotten into deep trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he hadn\u2019t been absorbing the energy from within the monster core for very long, he could clearly tell that the energy within the Class 1 Monster Core was substantially less than before; the monster core had even shrunk in size.Jian Chen inhaled sharply in astonishment at this new change. Although a Class 1 Monster Core did not have a large amount of energy, before he had became a Saint, completely absorbing all of the energy within a Class 1 Monster Core would require him at least 3 nights. In the short amount of time that he had spent absorbing the energy from the Class 1 Monster Core, the amount of energy inside had already decreased significantly Jian Chen couldn\u2019t possibly dare to imagine just how much energy he had absorbed into his body in that short amount of time.Afterwards, Jian Chen immediately inspected his inner body once more. However, to his surprise, he couldn\u2019t detect any of the energy he had just absorbed at all. His dantian didn\u2019t show any change, and the energy inside had no indication of growth either; it was almost as if the entire show just now was merely an illusion that hadn\u2019t occurred at all.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Jian Chen could clearly feel that the energy in the monster core was now less than before, then Jian Chen would have thought this situation had all been in his head; this situation was far too weird to understand.His eyes creased together in deep thought, but no matter how much he thought about it, Jian Chen was completely confused. In the end, Jian Chen could only put aside the problem and begin to cultivate the absorbed energy. However, after experiencing that rapid rate of absorption, Jian Chen was very careful now and paid attention to his entire body in order to avoid the same situation as last time.But then who would had thought the moment he started to cultivate, the same event as last time would happen once more. The monster core in his hand emitted a faint glow as the energy inside coursed out of it at an inconceivable speed, before dissipating inside the meridians in his arms.Jian Chen went as rigid as a stone statue on his bed, without the smallest of movements taking place. Right now, he had finally confirmed that this was happening for real, and it was not just some sort of illusion. Just as Jian Chen was going to stop absorbing the monster core\u2019s energy, he immediately changed his mind. His entire mind was elevated to the highest level of concentration he could muster as he tried to familiarize himself with this situation. He wanted to clearly understand what was happening within his body, and what the reason was for the sudden terrifying increase in absorption. Moreover, Jian Chen wanted to know why the energy had simply disappeared into his dantian like a stone in the ocean, leaving behind no traces.The monster core within Jian Chen\u2019s hands had noticeably shrunken, and the energy inside had been steadily flowing into the meridians of his arms via his pores. With such a great flow of energy rushing into his arm, Jian Chen\u2019s skin was starting to feel a little sore from the barrage.When he was absorbing the World Essence two days ago, its state had been much gentler, so the fast rate of absorption hadn\u2019t bothered him too much. But the monster core was different; the monster core had the energy of a magical beast condensed within it. No matter how strong the energy or how pure the soul was, it was far superior to the abilities of the World Essence.\u00a0The monster core also contained a berserk element inside, so when Jian Chen was absorbing the energy from within, he had felt a backlash.Jian Chen paid no attention to the pain at all, and instead completely focused his attention on the situation happening inside himself. The majority of the energy from within the monster core headed towards his dantian and trickled away; only a small portion of it was assimilated into his body.However when Jian Chen discovered where the energy was going, his face grew bright, as the energy was flowing towards the azure and violet\u00a0glows within his dantian. The energy had unexpectedly been completely absorbed by the two glowing balls.Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes as he stared heavily at the monster core in his hands. Throwing it away, he shut his eyes closed once more, and began to cultivate the World Essence as he usually did.The World Essence began to flow towards him in a steady stream, faster and faster. Although the speed was at least a dozen times faster than his regular speed, about 99% of the World Essence was being absorbed by the two glows of light within his dantian, while he was only absorbing 1% of the remaining amount into his body.After realizing this, Jian Chen decided to rely on cultivating using the World Essence.\u00a0However, the speed at which he was cultivating and refining the World Essence was ten times slower than his normal speed.With this conclusion, Jian Chen\u2019s expression grew ugly. His own personal cultivation rate was cut down to a tenth of his original rate, something he did not want at all. He hadn\u2019t imagined that the two glows in his dantian would be such an annoyance.Afterwards, Jian Chen tried to absorb the monster core\u2019s energy once more. His solemn face gradually loosened up as he began to think. If he were to cultivate using the energy from the monster core, then his cultivation rate wouldn\u2019t be as slow as before he became a Saint; instead, it would be three times as fast. The most major flaw was that the amount it took to absorb the energy in this way required a lot of effort; Jian Chen had even started to sweat from the exertion.Stopping his cultivation after a while, he looked outside the window to see the pitch dark skies and helplessly sighed. If the glows in his dantian were to forcibly take his energy each and every time he cultivated, then the variables in his future would only get more difficult. After all, just relying on absorbing the World Essence gave him a tenth of his cultivation speed. Absorbing the energy from the monster core tripled his speed, while also consuming more of his personal energy and focus, something Jian Chen couldn\u2019t endure.A single Class 1 Monster Core originally took Jian Chen 3 nights to absorb. Right now, absorbing that same Class 1 Monster Core required the same amount of time it took to make and drink a cup of tea. This meant that in a single night, Jian Chen could absorb 50 Class 1 Monster Cores. Even if Jian Chen was made of money, it would be difficult to say if Jian Chen could keep up with this new rate of consumption and absorption.TL Note: 10 minutes per Class 1 Monster CoreJian Chen immediately composed himself. According to his knowledge, he knew that this little bump on the road wasn\u2019t too hard to overcome. \u201cAi, a step is a step. If I don\u2019t have anymore monster cores, then I\u2019ll go out and hunt for more. It\u2019s not like the energy will always be taken away from me like this in the future.\u201d With this thought in mind, Jian Chen took out a batch of monster cores from within his space belt, and continued to cultivate once more.The night passed quickly. The second morning arrived, concluding Jian Chen\u2019s daily cultivation period. Taking inventory of the amount of monster cores he used, he sucked in a sharp breath in shock. In the span of a single night, he had unexpectedly consumed the energy from 56 Class 1 Monster Cores.Jian Chen smiled bitterly. Even though his Space Belt contained a wealthy amount of monster cores, with this rate of consumption, the monster cores wouldn\u2019t last for more than a few days. When there were no more to absorb, Jian Chen would then be forced to rely on the World Essence. Right now, Jian Chen could only hope that his dantian and the two glows of light inside would become saturated with energy, and stop taking it from him when he cultivated.\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ll have to make a trip to the magical beast forest for some monster cores later.\u201d Jian Chen muttered under his breath.With a pacified heart, Jian Chen departed from his room and walked towards the grove outside of the academy to help teach his older brother with some techniques regarding fighting, as well as helping him gain some battle experience. As the sun rose, Jian Chen worked hard to teach Changyang Hu. Eventually, as the sun was at its highest point, Jian Chen concluded his explanations.\u201cBig brother, we\u2019ll stop here for now. As far as using and transforming your energy, you\u2019ll have to spend some time on getting it down. But when it comes to battle experience, you\u2019ll just have to fight with others to slowly improve, so there\u2019s no point in practicing by yourself so meticulously.\u201d Jian Chen said to his older brother. For the past few days, Jian Chen had spent his mornings teaching Changyang Hu various aspects of techniques and fighting.Changyang Hu nodded his head, \u201cI understand, fourth brother.\u201d Right now, Changyang Hu did not think that learning from his fourth brother was an odd occurrence. He didn\u2019t know what Jian Chen\u2019s lifestyle was like back at the Changyang Mansion, but he could tell that his own brother was a talented genius. Receiving some special attention would have been normal, so it wasn\u2019t that far fetched to think that Jian Chen had learned these things from the clan elders. In addition, Changyang Hu knew that Jian Chen loved to read books, frequently spending entire days inside the academy\u2019s library.. So it was possible that some of the things he knew came from the library as well.\u201cBig brother, you should slowly practice by yourself. I\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d With that, Jian Chen exited the grove, leaving his brother to continue training by himself.\u2026\u2026In the middle of one of the academy training grounds, two youths wearing the same academy uniform were fiercely fighting against each other. One of them held a giant blade burning a fiery red as it emitted a sizzling Qi. The owner of such a strong weapon was the gifted cultivation genius of Kargath Academy\u2013Cheng Ming Xiang.Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s opponent was holding a giant sword that was blue in color. He looked to be older than Cheng Ming Xiang. However, his face was dripping with sweat as he concentrated on the fight.They fought ferociously, but a perceptive person would have been able to tell that the blue sword wielder was being forced to blindly defend against the red sword wielder.\u201cMy lord, I concede. I cannot defend myself any longer.\u201d The blue sword holder cried out.Hearing him, Cheng Ming Xiang immediately paused and let the sword in his hand disappear. \u201cSha La, it seems like the duration that you can defend yourself for is getting shorter and shorter. Looks like you have to work harder in the future; the current you is weaker than in the past.\u201dThe youth gave a bitter smile as he laughed, \u201cMy lord, it is not that my strength is getting worse, but that your strength is growing faster than mine. I am no longer a suitable opponent for you.\u201dCheng Ming Xiang looked proud at himself when he heard these words.At that moment, another student wearing the academy uniform came running over towards Cheng Ming Xiang with an envelope in his hand. \u201cLord Cheng, a letter from the clan elders have come!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Taking the letter from him, Cheng Ming Xiang began to rip open the letter.As he read the contents of the letter, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s face grew darker and darker as his eyes began to show a raging anger within them.Seeing Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s reaction, the youth who had just sparred with him asked cautiously, \u201cLord Cheng, what is the matter, has something bad happened over at the sect?\u201dClenching his hand together to become a fist, the letter became a crumpled up ball of paper as Cheng Ming Xiang grew angrier and angrier. The look in his eye had already evolved to contain a look of extreme hatred.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian\u2026\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang gnashed at his teeth as his fingers clenched tightly into his palms. Just by looking at him one could tell just how angry he was.Hearing Cheng Ming Xiang mentioned Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s name, the youth grew even more confused. Opening his mouth to ask once more, he said, \u201cLord Cheng, what in the world has happened?\u201dCheng Ming Xiang growled with a dark voice, \u201cHis Majesty has just betrothed Princess Ge Lan to Changyang Xiang Tian, and has already officiated it.\u201dThe youth\u2019s face changed when he heard him. He knew that Cheng Ming Xiang had fond feelings for the princess. Ever since Cheng Ming Xiang had first seen her at the imperial palace, he had essentially placed her beauty on the same level as a goddess and developed a deep crush on her. Since then, he had been unable to get over those feelings.Within Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s own heart, he had already marked Princess Ge Lan as his own. After all, within the Gesun Kingdom, he was the only suitable match for a princess like her. Whether it be familial background or his own cultivation talent, Cheng Ming Xiang was not at all lacking in these 2 fields. With his Hua Yun Sect, they had power that almost rivaled the power of the royal family of the Gesun Kingdom. Within the sect itself, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s status was majestic beyond any other person.In the past, Cheng Ming Xiang had wanted his parents to ask for the princess\u2019s hand in marriage from the emperor multiple times, but his parents had continuously wanted him to focus on cultivation instead. They didn\u2019t want his cultivation to be interrupted by a girl in the end.His parents refusal to help him propose to the princess had made him resentful, but he didn\u2019t say anything. For in his mind, Cheng Ming Xiang had decided that Princess Ge Lan was already his and that no one else would be able to snatch her away from him. After all, within the Gesun Kingdom, there was no one else worthy of Princess Ge Lan, causing him to feel safe.But he didn\u2019t expect at all to meet someone else in Kargath Academy that was no weaker than himself. Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s gift at cultivation had exceeded his own, and he had even taken over Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s title of Kargath Academy\u2019s number 1 cultivation genius. Not only did he steal that, but Changyang Xiang Tian had even stolen away his one love, causing Cheng Ming Xiang to be unable to endure this any longer.The youth that fought against Cheng Ming Xiang cautiously looked at him before whispering, \u201cMy lord, what do you plan to do now?\u201dCheng Ming Xiang\u2019s eyes flashed with a murderous tint as he snarled, \u201cPrincess Ge Lan is mine, within the Gesun Kingdom, only I am suitable to be married to her.\u201d His voice was filled with an unquenchable hatred, \u201cSha La, bring some people over, we shall head towards Changyang Xiang Tian. This time, we will definitely teach him a lesson on trying to steal someone else\u2019s woman.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The youth immediately scurried off in order to gather about people.Due to Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s strength, he had quickly amassed a large group of people. There were at least 16 of them and all were from noble families and had reached Sainthood. Not only that, but the majority of these people had their monster cores taken from them by Jian Chen, causing them to fail the assignment in the forest. So because of that, they all harbored a grudge towards him; and when Cheng Ming Xiang had started to gather people, each one of them eagerly signed up to take part in this.Among the group, there were two other people Jian Chen was very familiar with. They were Luo Jian of the Luo Clan and Ka Di Yun of the Ka Di Clan.Cheng Ming Xiang gave a steady glance at everyone, a great big smile on his face. \u201cGood, there\u2019s plenty of people here. Even if we were to turn Changyang Xiang Tian into a cripple, the Changyang Clan wouldn\u2019t dare say anything. The people gathered here today have no small amount of influence, even the emperor would get a headache if he were to try protecting Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dCheng Ming Xiang was confident that he could beat Changyang Xiang Tian in a fair battle, but now that His Majesty had officially declared the wedding between Changyang Xiang Tian and Princess Ge Lan, his status was like black and white compared to before. Not only did he have the backing of the Changyang Clan, but now he had the royal family supporting him. With this combination, even Cheng Ming Xiang who had a considerable amount of power and influence would need to think carefully before planning. If he wanted to teach a simple lesson, then there would not be as big a problem, but Cheng Ming Xiang didn\u2019t think it would be that easy. So for that reason, he had called many influential people to join him. With a coalition of power like this, the emperor would have to think twice before investigating. The Changyang Clan itself didn\u2019t even have a voice at all against this group.\u201cSha La, immediately fetch someone to go look for Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s location. Remember, this should not be let out at all. If the vice headmaster or the headmaster find out about it, all of our plans will be ruined.\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang ordered his training partner.\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201dAfterwards, Sha La either directly spent money or relied on connections within the academy to secretly hear of Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s immediate location. At the same time, he also dispatched quite a few of his trusted people to search the entire academy.It was extremely calm within Kargath Academy; nothing had been riled up by Cheng Ming Xiang and his group of people\u2019s movements.Two hours later, the 20 students that Sha La had dispatched all returned, one by one.\u201cLord Cheng, we\u2019ve searched the entire Kargath Academy, but there was no signs of Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201d A person reported to him.Cheng Ming Xiang frowned and said, \u201cHow is that possible? Could it be that Changyang Xiang Tian is not currently within the academy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard Changyang Xiang Tian loved to read in the library, have you searched that building yet?\u201d Luo Jian asked from the side. Although Luo Jian had been stabbed by Jian Chen, the medicine had healed his body back to the point of it being as good as new.\u201cWe\u2019ve also searched the library. Changyang Xiang Tian isn\u2019t there.\u201d The leader of the search continued.At that moment, a slightly chubby youth said, \u201cI heard that Changyang Xiang Tian is the Freshmen Ruler. The Freshmen Ruler has the special privilege of being able to enter the library\u2019s first 5 levels. Could it be that Changyang Xiang Tian is hiding within the 5th level? If that really is true, then we can only wait until he comes out before we act.\u201dHearing their fellow student, everyone in the group nodded, what that person had said had some logic behind it.The leader in charge of the search shook his head and said, \u201cThat can\u2019t be. I already asked the janitor lady within the library; she said that Changyang Xiang Tian didn\u2019t enter the library at all today.\u201d\u201cCould it be Changyang Xiang Tian is truly not within the academy grounds?\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang frowned.At that moment, another student hesitated slightly before saying, \u201cLord Cheng, although we didn\u2019t find Changyang Xiang Tian, we did discover that Changyang Hu is in the eastern grove. Changyang Hu is Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s older brother; I feel like he might know of Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s whereabouts.\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s eyes lit up, but his expression soon fell again. He had just remembered everything that had happened that night; the monster cores in his possession had all been stolen from the Changyang brothers and Tie Ta. Although he didn\u2019t dare to get revenge on Tie Ta, he wasn\u2019t afraid of the consequences of confronting Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s brother Changyang Hu\u201cNot bad, Changyang Hu definitely knows where Changyang Xiang Tian went. I recommend that we go ask him.\u201d Luo Jian said in a lower voice, his eyes flashing dangerously.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll go find Changyang Hu first.\u201dEveryone else quickly agreed with Luo Jian\u2019s suggestion. For the sake of not attracting other students\u2019 attentions, a dozen of them split with the group and took different paths towards the eastern grove.When the dozen of them rushed to the grove, they saw that Changyang Hu was still there, practicing his martial arts.At the sight of Changyang Hu, Luo Jian\u2019s eyes immediately burned in hatred, as if he could spit out flames. Perhaps Changyang Hu was too absorbed in his practice, but he didn\u2019t sense Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s people\u2019s arrival.Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s group of people walked up to Changyang Hu, and in unison, they stood in a circle surrounding him. Realizing this, Changyang Hu finally awoke from his concentration. By the time he had reacted, he had already been surrounded by dozens of studentsChangyang Hu\u2019s gaze surveyed his surroundings. After he saw the expressions on the other party\u2019s faces, his heart skipped a beat as he had a bad premonition. Especially after he saw Luo Jian\u2019s hatred-filled glare towards him, Changyang Hu\u2019s expression could not help but grow heavy.\u201cWhat do you guys want?\u201d Changyang Hu said. Despite the dozen or so people surrounding him, his face still did not show a single trace of fear.Luo Jian sneered, \u201cChangyang Hu, do you not remember what happened in the forest a few days ago?\u201d His face grew dark as he spoke and glared at him. \u201cYour group dared to steal my three days worth of hard work and caused me to fail. For this slight, I will definitely pay you back an eye for an eye.\u201dChangyang Hu snorted, and his gaze at Luo Jian showed no trace of fear as he coldly said, \u201cLuo Jian, that was trouble that you had brought onto yourself; there\u2019s no way we are to blame for what happened. If you hadn\u2019t first tried to steal our monster cores, then the following events wouldn\u2019t have occurred. Everything was your own fault; if you want to blame something, you can only blame your lack of strength. You even got defeated by my fourth brother, who hadn\u2019t even reached Sainthood yet.\u201d Changyang Hu mocked, as he looked at Luo Jian in disdain.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Luo Jian was momentarily so indignant at Changyang Hu\u2019s response that he couldn\u2019t respond. The event that had occurred that night in the forest was a humiliation that he would never be able to wipe from his memory. Despite his strength as a middle-ranked Saint level, he had lost to a freshman that hadn\u2019t yet become a Saint. In addition, the monster cores that he had spent 3 days of painstaking efforts to collect had all been taken away. This result was definitely something that the Young Master of the Luo clan couldn\u2019t accept.If word of his humiliation reached the clan, then Luo Jian would not be able to hold his head up high in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So when Luo Jian had summoned his Saint Weapon, he had summoned his own yellow colored battleaxe without any fear of the rapidly incoming Luo Jian.When the two Saints started to move, the surrounding circle of people instinctively took a step back in order to avoid injury.\u201cPeng!\u201dLuo Jian\u2019s sword and Changyang Hu\u2019s battleaxe clashed against each other emitting a tremendously loud sound. After the two weapons smashed into each other, the force of their actions caused the two to tremble in reaction. Their feet slowly retreating backwards, with Changyang Hu going back four or five steps while Luo Jian slowly retreated two or three steps.The two started to fight at a very close distance, but the spectators could tell that Changyang Hu was slowly losing ground. Although Luo Jian\u2019s wind attribute Saint Force focused on speed, and his attack was slightly weaker, his strength was still at the middle-ranked Saint level. Even if Changyang Hu\u2019s earth-attribute Saint Force had stronger defense, he wasn\u2019t Luo Jian\u2019s equal. After all, Changyang Hu had just reached Saint level not too long ago.Luo Jian didn\u2019t plan on letting Changyang Hu off so easily. His body flashed with a cyan glow, and a wind began to revolve around his body endlessly. Luo Jian\u2019s body instantly appeared in front of Changyang Hu, the great sword raised high in the air, glowing cyan. He slashed it down towards Changyang Hu at frightening speeds; since Luo Jian\u2019s Saint Force used the wind attribute, his speed was levels higher than other people\u2019s.Changyang Hu\u2019s expression suddenly changed. Luo Jian\u2019s attack speed was so fast that he had no time to counter. In the end, he barely managed to raise the axe in his hand to block the attack with difficulty.\u201cChangyang Hu, accept your death!\u201dAt that moment when Changyang Hu\u2019s axe hit Luo Jian\u2019s sword, another voice came crying out from the sidelines. It was Ka Di Yun with his own sword coming straight at him and immediately slash down onto Changyang Hu\u2019s right arm.An intense pain caused Changyang Hu to let out a groan. It was obvious that this attack had used quite a bit of Ka Di Yun\u2019s strength. It left a wound so deep on Changyang Hu\u2019s shoulder that one could see the bone.With his arm having suffered from such a huge attack, Changyang Hu could no longer maintain the Saint Weapon in his hand, and the great axe disappeared from his hand.Luo Jian\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold look and swung his sword at the stomach of Changyang Hu. The point of the sword ripped apart his uniform, and left a deep wound on Changyang Hu\u2019s stomach. Immediately, a river of blood came flowing out of the wound, causing his uniform to be dyed a bloody red.A look of extreme pain flashed through his face, but he didn\u2019t dare let out a sound.\u201cChangyang Hu, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get what you deserved so quickly.\u201d Luo Jian roared with laughter, the hatred he bore towards Changyang Hu couldn\u2019t be resolved easily. With another wave of his sword, he slashed down and left yet another wound on Changyang Hu\u2019s body.Changyang Hu\u2019s eyes were filled with a fierce glare towards Luo Jian as he snarled. \u201cLuo Jian, how useless you are, just because you couldn\u2019t beat my fourth brother, you have to fight me. Just wait and see if my fourth brother won\u2019t beat the crap out of you.\u201dHearing Changyang Hu, Luo Jian\u2019s face grew dark. Striding forward, he immediately kicked Changyang Hu.Changyang Hu\u2019s eyes flashed at the opportunity, just as Luo Jian\u2019s leg was about to make contact, his left arm flew out and clasped onto it. With a mighty strength, Changyang Hu pulled at it.Luo Jian\u2019s sense of balance was immediately disrupted, causing him to fall to the ground.\u201cHa!\u201d Changyang Hu roared, his left hand formed a fist as his Saint Force entered his hand. Bringing it down, his fist speeding towards the floored Luo Jian.Luo Jian wasn\u2019t slow to react however, as soon as he hit the floor, he rolled sideways away from Changyang Hu, causing the Saint Force enhanced fist to miss.\u201cPeng!\u201dChangyang Hu\u2019s fist smashed against the floor and left behind a giant crater as it sunk into the ground.\u201cChangyang Hu, you really are looking to die!\u201d Luo Jian\u2019s handsome face went deathly white. With a snarl, the green colored wind attribute Saint Force condensed into his fist, and almost as if it were lightning, he slammed his fist into Changyang Hu\u2019s stomach.\u201cPff!\u201d Changyang Hu spat out a glob of blood as his body was sent flying backwards. After four or five meters his body finally descended to the ground with a loud crash.Just as Luo Jian decided to rush forward to beat Changyang Hu even more, Cheng Ming Xian blocked his path, \u201cLuo Jian, you\u2019ve taught him a lesson already. Our main goal is Changyang Xiang Tian, not Changyang Hu. At the very least let us beat Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s whereabouts out from him first.\u201dLuo Jian slowly nodded his head in silence. If it were someone other than Cheng Ming Xiang, then he would have looked down on the suggestion in contempt. But Cheng Ming Xiang was someone he couldn\u2019t afford to offend.Cheng Ming Xiang approached Changyang Hu with a cold laugh, \u201cChangyang Hu, where is Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dChangyang Hu crawled up from the ground with some difficulty, his face was pale from blood loss, and his mouth still had a few drops of blood trailing down his face. But since his Saint Force had the earth attribute, his defenses were fairly strong. If it were anyone else, that person wouldn\u2019t even have the strength to twitch a finger.Changyang Hu stared at the people surrounding him and growled. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but even if I did know, I wouldn\u2019t tell any of you.\u201d Although he had confidence in Jian Chen\u2019s strength, every single person here was at the Saint level, and he didn\u2019t want his younger brother to fight alone against this group.Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s face grew dark as he said coldly, \u201cChangyang Hu, I\u2019ll give you one more chance. Where is Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201dChangyang Hu looked up at him and gave a bloody smile, \u201cI already said I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang sneered. Smashing his fist against Changyang Hu\u2019s face, he immediately slammed him to the ground once more. \u201cWill you speak or not?\u201dChangyang Hu\u2019s anger grew tremendously as he crawled up from the floor with the last of his strength, \u201cThis one won\u2019t tell you! Cheng Ming Xiang, you better kill me straight away, or else, I Changyang Hu, swear that I will make you regret this!\u201dCheng Ming Xiang looked at him with disdain, \u201cChangyang Hu, what right do you have to say that, could it be because you are the young lord to the Changyang Clan? Hmph, it is merely the Changyang Clan, my Hua Yun Sect cares not about your clan.\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s eyes flashed once more and he cocked his right hand backwards. With a bright red glint, the fist burrowed itself into Changyang Hu\u2019s head. \u201cWill. You. Speak?\u201dChangyang Hu\u2019s body was badly bruised by the punch. Already his head was starting to drip with blood, but his resolute expression was still there, looking as fierce as always.\u201cYou and I will go down together!\u201d Changyang Hu couldn\u2019t take it anymore. With the yellow light gathering in his left hand, he immediately slashed at Cheng Ming Xiang with his reformed Saint Weapon.A blazing red sword materialized in Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s hand and he easily blocked Changyang Hu\u2019s attack. Not only did Changyang Hu suffer from serious injuries, he also was not accustomed to using his left hand to control his axe. Even if he had been completely fine, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have been Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s equal anyways.Cheng Ming Xiang looked at Changyang Hu with a jeering sneer, \u201cChangyang Hu, I recommend you be obedient and tell us where Changyang Xiang Tian, that way you\u2019ll feel less pain.\u201dChangyang Hu gasped for air before going oddly calm. He understood that continuing on this route would only lead to disaster. He looked around the area and surveyed his chances before immediately dispersing his Saint Weapon and started to run towards the sports field.This grove was pretty remote; normally, very few people passed through it. Thus, whatever happened here would naturally remain unknown to everyone else outside. Changyang Hu believed that once he ran to a more populated area, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s group of people definitely wouldn\u2019t dare to act. In addition, he had quite a few good friends within the academy. Although Changyang Hu didn\u2019t hope for them to help him resist Cheng Ming Xiang, he knew that they would at least run to notify a teacher, or even the vice headmaster.Seeing Changyang Hu run off towards the sports field, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s face changed. \u201cStop him!\u201d He called out.The dozen people who initially didn\u2019t move immediately set into motion. Quickly chasing after Changyang Hu, even Cheng Ming Xiang was starting to run at full speeds towards the direction of Changyang Hu.Changyang Hu was already seriously wounded, so he was unable to outrun these people. It hadn\u2019t even been a few moments before his pursuers had already began to catch up with him.Seeing his enemies quickly catching up to him, Changyang Hu felt fear creep into his heart as he realized that he would not be able to even make it out of the grove. With this thought, he snarled and immediately stopped in his tracks before retreating back into a different part of the grove.Changyang Hu suddenly changed directions, making his pursuers feel suspicious. However, soon after, they smiled coldly, and even slowed down their pursuit.The group of people behind stood in a semicircular arc as they took their time to chase after Changyang Hu. Luo Jian stood next to Cheng Ming Xiang and sneered, \u201cBased on the direction Changyang Hu is running towards, he\u2019s most likely looking for Changyang Xiang Tian.\u201dCheng Ming Xiang nodded, \u201cThat is true, so it seems Changyang Xiang Tian is indeed not in the academy.\u201dChangyang Hu used all his strength to run, but his current state was not looking good. His head was drenched with blood while his uniform was caked with blood and dirt, looking quite miserable all over. He truly had no idea where Jian Chen was, but he knew that within the grove was a small hillside with a complicated layout and a lush plant-life that was suitable for hiding. With the idea of fleeing into the school becoming obsolete, Changyang Hu\u2019s only plausible way to escape was to hide away in the hillside and hope to shake off his enemies.However, Changyang Hu had forgotten, that the place where Jian Chen had taught him this morning was currently in the opposite direction.At a waterfall on the hillsides, a uniformed youth was cultivating in a puddle not to far away from the grass. The figure looked quite slender and weak with long black hair that went down to his waist. He looked rather handsome and had a bright glow in his eyes that was similar to the twinkle that reflected off of his sword.The youth had a small, silver sword about 1.3 meters long and two fingers wide. On the sword hilt were two words written in fancy calligraphy\u2014\u2014Light Wind.The youth calmly stood there. The sword in his hand pointed to the ground, and his whole person was as motionless as a mountain.At that moment, the youth\u2019s eyes let out a spark of light. His body fluidly began to move without warning; only mirages from his quick movements could be seen. The silver sword in his hand had entirely become a white blur, and countless shadows of the sword blended together like an illusion that constantly flashed with light. As it moved in the air, only its afterimages could be seen.The youth cried out the words \u2018Profound Steps\u2019 as he moved through the ground quickly as if he was gliding with a great amount of agility and nimbleness. Seeing a rabbit, he quickly stabbed at it with his sword with such an inconceivable speed, anyone that saw him would be astounded.This youth was Jian Chen. After leaving the grove he had directly arrived at this beautiful landscape, remembering the feeling of the use of the sword that he had experienced before in his previous world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He slashed out with his sword at a rapid speed in several directions, his swordplay fast yet sharp.Following Jian Chen\u2019s quick movements, the wind scattered dry leaves into the air, fluttering around Jian Chen like gentle dancing butterflies.And at this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s swordplay suddenly changed. Although his sword techniques were still fast, but with every stab he made with his sword, the air whistled and left an afterimage that no ordinary person would be able to see easily.A moment after, the rapidly dancing sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hand suddenly stopped. But despite after such a long period of intense exercise, he did not even look out of breath and was instead still breathing normally.And at the same time, Jian Chen finally stopped his wild dance, the leaves that were all previously flying around him disintegrated into powder and scattered onto the ground. Only a few leaves were left completely intact, but written on some of them was the word \u201cSword\u201d. Although the size was different on each of them, it was written clearly and covered the entire area on each leaf. Although, there were some other leaves with the word \u201cSword\u201d on it that had missing strokes, being either unclear or incomplete.If anyone else saw this sight, then they would surely be amazed to the point of having to pick up their jaw from the ground. This scene was far too astonishing to believe since the leaves had been floating wildly through the air and even weaved with other leaves at random intervals. Just focusing on one leaf amid the mess of them, constantly changing positions in the air would definitely cause a person to become dizzy. It would had been even more impossible to think that someone had been able to clearly write the word \u201cSword\u201d on any of them.Most importantly, the leaves were very fragile and liable to break upon the gentlest of touch. To use a sword to achieve such a feat without leaving a single trace of a tear, was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.If people were to find out about what Jian Chen had done, then his name and prestige would be announced and known to the entire Tian Yuan continent in the shortest period of time.Watching the still intact leaves gently float down to the ground with a happy smile, Jian Chen muttered to himself, \u201cAlthough my speed with a sword has deteriorated, my control over it has greatly improved to a level that can\u2019t even compare to my past. It\u2019s almost as if the sword has become an integral part of my body; perhaps this is the advantage of this world\u2019s Saint Weapon.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s ears suddenly detected a sound. Concentrating on the source, Jian Chen turned towards the opening of the grove while willing his silver sword to fade away.In a short amount of time, the place where Jian Chen looked at started to shake even more before a bloodied figure with a ripped uniform came scurrying out of it.Just one look at the clothes of the person and Jian Chen automatically knew that this was a student of Kargath Academy. But for what reason why the student was bloody all over, Jian Chen was puzzled. There were no magical beasts around so there was no reason why he would be so injured. Kargath Academy also had strict rules about fighting among students. While giving each others pointers was allowed, fights that could lead to fatal injuries were not allowed.However, when Jian Chen looked at the student\u2019s face, he immediately became stunned. His face froze in a hard expression as he looked at the amount of blood that covered half of the student\u2019s face. Jian Chen couldn\u2019t believe what he saw, so he opened his mouth to cry out.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Came the astonished shout. In a flash, he crossed over 30 meters to arrive at his blood soaked and injured brother with worry etched on his face.Seeing the horrible wound on Changyang Hu as well as the blood still flowing from his head, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes narrowed in anger. \u201cBig brother, what happened to you. Who did this to you?\u201d An intense murderous intent was emitted from his body the longer he looked at his injured brother.When it came to his brother Changyang Hu, he was the only person Jian Chen had actually cared about after his mother because Changyang Hu had treated him like a true younger brother, so Jian Chen had wanted to repay him for this debt. When he had first come to Kargath Academy, it was Changyang Hu who had brought him on a tour around the academy grounds and explained the rules to him. He faced huge amounts of danger after running into the magical beast forest to fight and kill a Class 1 Magical Beast to gift Jian Chen its monster core without any regard for his own personal health. Although Class 1 Magical Beasts weren\u2019t even a threat to Jian Chen, Changyang Hu did not have as much fighting experience or combat skills as Jian Chen. At the time, Changyang Hu only had the strength of a peak 10th Saint Force Layer cultivator, so obtaining a Class 1 Monster Core wouldn\u2019t have been an easy task for him.Later on, his brother had even fought against Ka Di Yun for him on the platform even after knowing his own strength was lacking in comparison to his opponent, initiating the challenge.Jian Chen had clearly felt that Changyang Hu cared for him from the bottom of his heart, and so from then on, Jian Chen had always treated him like close family.In his previous life, Jian Chen was a war orphan who had his parents murdered by the enemy army. From his birth, he had no family or friends and never knew the warm embrace of family. But now that God had arranged such a nice life for him, Jian Chen would definitely treasure this, and Changyang Hu held the second biggest spot in his heart after his mother Bi Yun Tian. So seeing Changyang Hu beaten into such a state, Jian Chen\u2019s heart flew into a rage that was unprecedented. A single look from him gave the feeling that it could injure someone.Seeing Jian Chen suddenly appear, Changyang Hu looked at him with a dazed expression. However his face changed once more as he spoke anxiously, \u201cFourth brother, why\u2026why are you here. Hurry up and run! Leave this place, they\u2019ll be here in a moment!\u201d Changyang Hu looked impatient; he hadn\u2019t thought that he would run into Jian Chen here.Instead of running, Jian Chen\u2019s face darkened as he said in a low voice, \u201cBig brother, who in the world beat you to such a state?\u201d The suppressed rage in his tone could\u2019ve been identified by anyone.Changyang Hu\u2019s hands desperately grabbed onto Jian Chen\u2019s body as he continued to speak urgently, \u201cFourth brother, don\u2019t bother asking about that right now and leave this place immediately. Take the long route back to the academy, or else they\u2019ll definitely find you.\u201d Although he knew Jian Chen\u2019s strength was enormous since he had beaten a Middle Saint, Changyang Hu did not believe that even Jian Chen could take on a dozen Saints, along with Cheng Ming Xiang, who was an Upper Saint.But Jian Chen stood right where he was, like a stone statue that could not be budged. No matter what Changyang Hu did, nothing would sway Jian Chen. With eyes that spoke volumes of his murderous intent, he glared at the grove, waiting for someone to come out.A dozen uniformed students eventually walked into his range of sight, with Luo Jian and Cheng Ming Xiang walking in front of the group.When they saw Jian Chen, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s and Luo Jian\u2019s expressions became excited. With a big smile, Luo Jian said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, we\u2019ve found you at last. I was beginning to wonder where you had run off to.\u201d Without any need for instructions, the group of people immediately surrounded Jian Chen and his brother in a circle.Seeing how he and his brother were surrounded, Changyang Hu\u2019s face grew ugly and gave a small sigh. But other than that, he said nothing.Despite the arrogant manner of the people around him, Jian Chen did not look scared at all, and instead remained calm. It was almost as if he had not even noticed such weak people were surrounding him at all.Jian Chen\u2019s face hardened as his eyes swept across the faces of the people around him. Some of them had pained looks on their faces; they felt a chill well up in their hearts, as if Jian Chen\u2019s stare was a cold blade that had penetrated their souls.\u201cWho was the one who beat my brother!?\u201d Jian Chen shouted, \u201cStep forward!\u201d Immediately, a large amount of force was released into the air. Despite the dozen members in front of him, Jian Chen was not scared, and instead held his head up high as a sign of his determination to not give up.Jian Chen\u2019s powerful command was accompanied by the release of a strong Qi, causing all of them to take an instinctive step backwards. After all, Jian Chen had already been baptized with murderous intent, and the children in front of him who still had the smell of their mother\u2019s milk on them would not be able to stand up against it.Realizing that he had been intimidated by Jian Chen\u2019s command, Cheng Ming Xiang became angry. He had thought that with his majestic Upper Saint strength, it would be him that would be doing the intimidation; he couldn\u2019t accept the reverse outcome.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, you\u2019re seeking death right now!\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang snarled. The fiery red sword appeared in his hands, and gave off a searing red glow as it struck out towards Jian Chen\u2019s chest.\u201cHmph!\u201d Seeing the stab of the sword, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed with strong murderous intent. His Light Wind Sword immediately appeared in his right hand, parrying the stab from the other sword as fast as lightning.\u201cDing!\u201dA crisp sound rang out as the two swords clashed; both points of the swords had somehow pressed against each other.Seeing how the two points of the sword made contact with each other, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s eyes widened in shock. He couldn\u2019t believe such an event had happened. Even if Jian Chen was his opponent, having the two points of the sword meet as both swordsmen stabbed out wasn\u2019t something any normal person could replicate, especially considering the difference in size between their two swords, and the speed at which they had thrust their swords forward. And to be able to do it so flawlessly, this was not the sign of a weak person; it signified that a person\u2019s Saint Weapon control had far surpassed that of a typical Saint.However, Jian Chen, who had only recently broken through Sainthood, had easily achieved such a feat. This made Cheng Ming Xiang skeptical. He had thought that this was a coincidence, but the moment he saw Jian Chen\u2019s calm face, his heart immediately dispelled any notions of it being one.Another thing that had startled Cheng Ming Xiang was the sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hands. Because the sword had been so tiny in comparison to his, he had thought it was merely an embroidery needle. It was four feet\u00a0long and 2 fingers wide, so it looked quite frail in his eyes. It looked as if the moment a large amount of strength was exerted onto it, the weapon would snap in half.Cheng Ming Xiang could swear that in his entire history of living, this was the first time he had ever seen such a sword. Within the Tian Yuan continent, every single Saint had a Saint Weapon that leaned towards a great broadsword, since they had all condensed their Saint Force into heavy-type weapons. This convention was a fact that was commonly accepted by almost every single cultivationist.If Jian Chen\u2019s delicately small sword wasn\u2019t able to block against his attack, then Cheng Ming Xiang definitely would have ridiculed Jian Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time, although opponent was only a newly broken through Saint, he was facing his opponent seriously for the first time.\u201cCheng Ming Xiang, since you\u2019ve beaten my big brother, then don\u2019t expect to leave from this place unharmed.\u201d Jian Chen stated coldly.Cheng Ming Xiang snorted in response and said, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I admit I\u2019ve underestimated you, but if you want to beat me with your new Saint powers, that won\u2019t be possible.\u201dJian Chen snorted as he looked on at Cheng Ming Xiang with disdain. \u201cWhether or not I have the ability to, come and see!\u201d Jian Chen immediately rushed forward his wrist perfectly controlled the Light Wind Sword and escaped the deadlock with Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s own sword by slapping the side of Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s sword fiercely.\u201cClang!\u201dAs the sounds of metal rang in the air, Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s sword was forced off to the sides by the Light Wind Sword. Jian Chen had struck out with his sword with such force that Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s sword arm had become numb with pain.At the same time, Jian Chen was in the air, stabbing the Light Wind Sword like a streak of silver light towards Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s chest.Cheng Ming Xiang turned pale with fright, Jian Chen\u2019s speed was nearly too quick for him to keep up with. He could only watch as the silver blade approached him with an inconceivable speed, unable to react or even move out of the way.The Light Wind Sword tore through Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s uniform and immediately sunk into his chest. But with Jian Chen\u2019s superior control, the sword did not sink in too deep.Immediately after feeling the sharp pain in his chest, Cheng Ming Xiang immediately retreated, causing Jian Chen\u2019s sword to be pulled out.Cheng Ming Xiang looked down to where the blood was dripping down onto his uniform with a terrified look. He replayed the moment over and over in his head; he had been unable to dodge the sword at all. In his entire life, he could swear that this was the fastest swordplay he had ever seen. He had even started to feel terrified at Jian Chen\u2019s strength, but he just couldn\u2019t understand how a newly advanced Saint could be this strong.Jian Chen didn\u2019t plan on letting him off too lightly though. Immediately using Profound Steps, he took off like a demon possessed and with another flash of his silver light, Jian Chen struck out at Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s chest with great speed.\u201cAh!\u201dCheng Ming Xiang let out a miserable shout as he saw blood spray out once more. The blood from the left side of his chest had started to spread over to his right side. The wound was so deep that the bone underneath could be seen as the blood inside his body violently bubbled out, staining the entire top half of his uniform with it.The fury in Jian Chen\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t dissipate at all as he brandished his Light Wind Sword and inflicted wound after wound upon Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s body.The wounds on Cheng Ming Xiang steadily increased, each one looking even more frightening than the one before while going deep into the body. Not only was his body being sliced at, but his entire academy uniform had already started to fall apart, and the remaining cloth becoming redder by the second.Seeing how their strongest member Cheng Ming Xiang was powerless under Jian Chen, the dozen other students became as quiet as wooden chickens. Seeing how Cheng Ming Xiang was endlessly screaming, this had completely overturned what they had thought about him as they looked on with a stunned expression.Luo Jian reacted first, even though he was equally amazed at the display of strength Jian Chen was showing, he had at least ten other companions who were all at the Saint level. With a great increase in courage, he roared, \u201cEverybody charge, even if he\u2019s strong, he\u2019s still just one person. How could we be afraid of just a single person?\u201d Luo Jian raised his green greatsword with a snarl as he charged towards Jian Chen.Hearing Luo Jian\u2019s speech, the students all jolted back to awareness. With a look at one another, the fear that was planted into their hearts by Jian Chen was immediately cast out. With a lift of their greatswords, battleaxe, large knives and spears, each student charged at Jian Chen with great arrogance.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed as he watched the people come forward, but he didn\u2019t retreat. Taking the initiative and charging in with his Light Wind Sword, he immediately stabbed toward the closest person\u2019s stomach.\u201cPch!\u201dJian Chen\u2019s sword slid into the student\u2019s body with ease. Against him, these students had no battle experience, so there was no way they\u2019d be able to fight back.\u201cHurk!\u201d\u201cGo die!\u201dAt that moment, Jian Chen had entered the encirclementJian Chen sneered, and the Light Wind Sword emitted a slight glow as traces of sharp and powerful Sword Qi began to spread out from the blade. Jian Chen\u2019s right hand seemed to turn into a mirage, as the Light Wind Blade seemed to pierce all four directions as fast as lightning. Every time he thrust his sword out, he could accurately hit another weapon. After only a short amount of time, Jian Chen had already lashed his sword out 10 times.\u201cDing\u201d \u201cDing!\u201d \u201cDing!\u201dA symphony of metal-against-metal sounds rang out, the sounds all merging together as one.When the Light Wind Sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hand collided with the Saint Weapons, the expressions of all the surrounding students that were all Middle Saints changed. They immediately retreated, the Saint Weapons in their hand shaking from the collision. Jian Chen\u2019s sword appeared to be extremely small, but it hid a great amount of power behind it. After a single collision with his sword, the Saint Weapons all vibrated so intensely from the aftershock that it made the students\u2019 arms numb.While blocking all of the attacks, Jian Chen\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. His movements did not pause at all, and his feet left traces in the ground as he used monster-like movements to charge through the group of people. The Light Wind Sword in his hand danced around in the air at high speeds, turning into a silver glow. The light made it look like there were millions of sword afterimages freezing in the air, disappearing in the blink of an eye.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dWith Jian Chen\u2019s monster-like movements, sharp shouts of pain rang out in the air. The desolate cries could make any weaker-hearted people absolutely horrified, and a chilliness began to arise in the air.The blood-covered Changyang Hu stood on the side, staring in a daze at the Jian Chen constantly moving about like a demon, causing the students to cry out in shock. At the moment, his mind had already completely ground to a halt; he had already completely lost his cognitive abilities.At that moment, the dozens of students had already all fallen to the ground. Their ashen faces were filled with pain, and their originally perfectly clean and tidy uniforms were now torn all over the place. Each tear was dripping with blood, dying their entire uniforms crimson. Moreover, that white light continuously flashed over their bodies, quickly increasing the number of wounds on their bodies. From their upper torso down to their legs, their entire bodies were covered with frightening wounds. Their blood flowed like rivers out from their injuries, and they quickly began to look like they were made of blood.Jian Chen circled the students at high speeds. The Light Wind Sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hand slashed at their bodies continuously, causing splashes of blood and torn pieces of clothing to fly out in the air.Changyang Hu\u2019s injuries greatly affected Jian Chen\u2019s emotions. Although Jian Chen didn\u2019t kill these dozens of students, he would definitely not let them go lightly. If these people weren\u2019t attending the same school as Jian Chen was, and if Jian Chen wasn\u2019t worried about stirring trouble within their families, he would definitely end their lives without hesitation.\u201cSenior Changyang Xiang Tian, please have mercy, please have mercy on us. We won\u2019t dare to to do this ever again.\u201d\u201cSenior Changyang Xiang Tian, please let us go this time. We won\u2019t ever do it again\u201dFinally, the people could no longer endure the torture, and had begun to beg for mercy. As soon as one person began to cry out, the others all started to plead for their lives as well. However, a few of the more temperamental people were still gritting their teeth and holding themselves back. They had also considered running, but both their legs and arms were currently sporting terrifying wounds. The slightest movement caused them to bite down in pain. There was no way they could run; at the least, they didn\u2019t have the willpower to endure such an intense pain.Jian Chen ceased his movements. His expression was cold and indifferent; he didn\u2019t have a hint of blush on his cheeks, and his breathing was calm. However, the Light Wind Sword in his hand was dripping with fresh blood.Jian Chen\u2019s body was as tall and straight as a mountain, immovable in his spot. His eyes flashed coldly as if they seemed to be able to pierce through one\u2019s soul. He slowly swept his gaze across the dozen students lying on the ground and said, \u201cI can let you guys go, but you have to answer this, who injured my older brother?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lord Cheng, Luo Jian, and Ka Di Yun\u2026.\u201d\u201cRight, it was those three that had injured Changyang Hu\u2026.\u201d\u201cChangyang Hu was wounded by those three; we didn\u2019t do anything at all.\u201dThe dozen youths struggled to say their excuses first, afraid that if they were too slow in their responses, Jian Chen would be discontent. At the moment, they had already long abandoned any thoughts of retaliation against Jian Chen, and wholeheartedly regretted their actions.Among them, half of the people had had their monster cores taken away by Jian Chen in the forest. The other half had no enmity towards Jian Chen, and had merely been gathered by Cheng Ming Xiang.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed fiercely. He coldly glared at Cheng Ming Xiang, Luo Jian, and Ka Di Yun, a powerful murderous intent evident in his gaze.Under Jian Chen\u2019s murderous gaze, Cheng Ming Xiang and the other two felt chills in their hearts, and all showed terrified expressions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let us go immediately, let\u2019s forget about the events that happened today, otherwise, just you wait for my Hua Yun Sect to come for revenge.\u201d Cheng Ming Xiang said sternly. Even an idiot could tell with one look that Jian Chen didn\u2019t plan on letting them go that easily. Right now, Cheng Ming Xiang wanted nothing else but to leave this place and plot his revenge for another day.Jian Chen sneered, \u201cLet you go? It won\u2019t be that easy.\u201dHearing this, Cheng Ming Xiang and the two others face dropped. Ka Di Yun spoke with a gloomy voice, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, we may have injured your brother, but now you have injured us, let us wipe the slate clean.\u201dJian Chen slowly walked towards the three with his Light Wind Sword emitting sword Qi. The three watched as the sword slowly envelop itself in a bright glow of silver as if it was being eaten by it.\u201cA clean slate? How could it be that easy? Today, you three will leave an arm behind, and if there is another time in the future, then it will be your life.\u201dJian Chen had already arrived in front of Ka Di Yun, his Light Wind Sword already swishing down in an arc like silver lightning towards Ka Di Yun\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dKa Di Yun let out a desolate scream as the intense feeling of pain wracked his face. Already all color had drained away from it. A fountain of blood sprayed out of the stump from where his right arm originally was as it flopped down onto the ground lifeless.Jian Chen had chopped off Ka Di Yun\u2019s right arm.Cheng Ming Xiang and Luo Jian\u2019s face immediately changed as they watched with a tremble. Another look at the severed arm, and then at Ka Di Yun\u2019s screaming figure had caused them to become deathly white in the face.The ten other students looked at Jian Chen with fear, this type of development was something they were not expecting to see. Who would had known that he was this merciless and severed someone\u2019s arm without hesitation? This cruel display had brought them no small amount of anxiety and fear. But there was a small shimmer of hope, they had fortunately not fought against Changyang Hu. If it were not for that small fact, then they had no doubt that they would be joining Luo Jian, Cheng Ming Xiang, and Ka Di Yun amongst the ranks of losing an arm.Jian Chen had treated the event as if it was an insignificant matter, his face not revealing any emotion whatsoever during the act. Whether it was the splattered blood on the ground or Ka Di Yun\u2019s screams of pain, it had no effect on him. Instead, he looked at Luo Jian and walked closer towards him with his bloody sword.As Jian Chen approached, fear filled Luo Jian\u2019s face. Ignoring the pain from his wounds, he began to crawl backwards away from Jian Chen at a snail like pace while crying, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, what\u2026what are you doing? Don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t come any closer!\u201dJian Chen kept his slow pace as he walked towards Luo Jian. With an icy stare that revealed no mercy in his eyes, he slowly raised his Light Wind Sword.Seeing Jian Chen lift his silver sword, Luo Jian became even more terrified. He had long since lost his arrogant attitude and started to plead to him, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, please\u2026I beg of you\u2026please don\u2019t cut off my arm, if you let me go, I, Luo Jian swear that in the future I will definitely repay you.\u201dJian Chen showed no signs of stopping. Swinging his sword in another arc of silver light, he swiftly cut off Luo Jian\u2019s arm under the owner\u2019s disbelieving eye.\u201cAh!\u201dA terrified scream came out from Luo Jian as his right arm was was separated from his shoulder, causing blood to come spraying out onto the ground.\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, I definitely won\u2019t let you go\u2026\u201d Luo Jian grimaced as he used his anger to roar in anger. Already his eyes became bloodshot as he stared at Jian Chen with intense hatred.Jian Chen didn\u2019t take any notice of Luo Jian\u2019s cry, and instead walked off towards Cheng Ming Xiang.Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s face was still a deathly white color. There was only regret in his heart as he realized his strength was weaker than Jian Chen\u2019s. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had a dozen other people at the Saint level, he wouldn\u2019t have been forced into such a difficult situation.Seeing the still approaching figure of Luo Jian, Cheng Ming Xiang couldn\u2019t quell the feeling of absolute dread in his heart as he tried to calm down. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, if you don\u2019t want to bring your clan into this\u2026\u201dHearing Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s words immediately caused a reaction from Jian Chen. A glare appeared on his eyes as he immediately flashed forward to where Cheng Ming Xiang was. Before he could even finish his sentence, Jian Chen had already lopped off his right arm.Cheng Ming Xiang stifled a shout as his face flashed with pain. He was not like Ka Di Yun or Luo Jian who had both screamed. The scream of pain had already been suppressed in his throat, but his face was still warped into a different expression, it would seem that his pain threshold was greater than the other two.Jian Chen\u2019s ice cold gaze landed on the three people and he coldly said, \u201cToday, I cut off your arm, but if there\u2019s a next time, I will take your life. Don\u2019t think I am bluffing, I will be true to my word.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s eyes swept over to where the other students laid.As he looked at each student, they look stared down at the ground in fear. Whenever Jian Chen had looked at them with his bloody sword, none of them had even the smallest idea of trying to get revenge.Jian Chen looked at his bloody Light Wind Sword; and with a single thought, he held the sword with the point facing downwards. All of the blood accumulated on the sword started to accumulate at the tip of the sword and slowly started to drip down onto the dusty earth, restoring the Light Wind Sword to its original bright glory.With the Light Wind Sword finally clean, Jian Chen returned to where Changyang Hu was. After seeing his bloody brother, the icy stare on Jian Chen\u2019s face softened as he said with concern, \u201cBig brother, let\u2019s go back now.\u201dChangyang Hu nodded his head dumbfounded. Right now his eyes were wide open after watching the entire fight that had just happened. Even though he had personally witnessed Jian Chen\u2019s victory, he was still having a hard time in believing it.Jian Chen lent a hand towards the bloody Changyang Hu and the both turned around to walk back to his dorm by a secluded road. But despite this, the both of them would still see enough people that would spread the news that Changyang Hu was heavily injured around the academy.Not long after Jian Chen had returned back to his room, the students lent a hand towards the three injured students and began their slow walk towards the academy. The moment the academy came into sight, everyone went into an uproar, especially for the three students each missing an arm, nobody could believe their eyes at what they had seen.The news of the injured students spread across the academy with rapid speed. The news had even spread to the teachers, who immediately reported it to the vice headmaster Bai En. When Bai En had heard that Cheng Ming Xiang, Luo Jian, and Ka Di Yun had their arms cut off, he placed extra importance on the matters and immediately relayed them to the medical experts of the academy.As Bai En arrived at the medicinal wing of the academy, a large group of people had already gathered on the outside as they clamored around for news.Vice headmaster Chang Bai En pushed aside the crowd of students, and directly forced his way up to the medicinal wing to see the situation. There were currently a dozen blood-covered students lying on stretchers. In the middle of the room stood 2 middle-aged men and a woman currently closing their eyes. They had their hands spread out above three of the students, emitting a milky white light from their hands that enveloped these students.Shrouded in milky white rays of light, the three students\u2019 terrifying wounds were being quickly sealed before their very eyes. The speed of the healing was unfathomably fast, and within a short breath, the three students\u2019 wounds had already disappeared without a trace.Once the wounds disappeared, the expressions on the three students\u2019 faces clearly changed. Now they showed no traces of pain; on the contrary, they looked a lot more relaxed now. At the same time, one could see traces of alarm in the depths of their eyes.After treating the three students, the two men and one woman showed their humble appreciation to Bai En. Soon after, they continued to treat the remaining dozen or more students in the middle.The vice headmaster had an ugly expression on his face as his gaze swept across the dozen students; his gaze lingered for an especially long time on Cheng Ming Xiang and the other two that had lost their right arms. His expression fell as he bellowed, \u201cWhat happened here? Who wounded you to this extent? Could it be that you encountered someone from outside? Hmph, don\u2019t they know that everything within this 100 kilometer perimeter is Kargath Academy\u2019s territory? To think that someone would dare to enter Kargath Academy and injure its students; this is really absurd.\u201d Bai En was fuming; it was very obvious that he thought that Cheng Ming Xiang and the other dozen students had been hurt by some people from the outside\u201cVice headmaster, it was Changyang Xian Tian, We were all injured by Changyang Xian Tian.\u201d a student weakly cried.\u201cThat\u2019s right, vice headmaster, you have to demand justice for us. Changyang Xiang Tian not only heavily injured us, but he even cut off the arms of Lord Cheng and the 2 others\u2026\u201d\u201cVice headmaster\u2026\u201dBai En was completely shocked into a daze by these words. He only felt disbelief; among these dozen students, the weakest person was at least a Lower Saint. There were even some Middle Saints, and one Upper Saint among them. With such a lineup, even if they encountered a Great Saint, they would still definitely be able to overwhelm him. He really couldn\u2019t believe that so many people had actually been beaten black and blue by a freshman that had only just broken through Saint level a few days ago. Bai En couldn\u2019t accept this fact at all.After confirming what actually happened, Bai En\u2019s expression immediately grew serious. His heart had already sank to the utmost degree. He immediately looked for the headmaster; what happened here was far too complicated for Bai En to resolve.After Bai En recounted the entire situation to the headmaster, the headmaster lost his calm. He jumped up from his chair with an expression of utter shock and said, \u201cWhat? Is what you said really true? Cheng Ming Xiang, Luo Jian, and Ka Di Yun all had their arms cut off by Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201d\u201cYes, headmaster, I personally made a trip to see. The three individuals\u2019 arms were indeed cut off.\u201d said Bai En solemnly.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d The headmaster sighed heavily and said, \u201cThis time the situation has worsened\u2026this Changyang Xiang Tian is far too impulsive. Ka Di Clan and Luo Clan are of no problem, however, Hua Yun sect is not someone the Changyang Clan can afford to offend.\u201d\u201cHeadmaster, what should we do now? Our Gesun Kingdom had much difficulty producing a genius like Changyang Xiang Tian. We can\u2019t just stand by and watch a genius with limitless potential die when he had not yet finished maturing. Otherwise, this would really be too major a loss for Gesun Kingdom.\u201d Vice headmaster Bai En said in a heavy tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bai En, you stay here and resolve the matters in the medicinal building, I will go to the Changyang Clan immediately. Otherwise, if we were to wait for the experts of the Hua Yun sect to arrive, the situation will become too terrible.After, the headmaster walked towards the frame of the window and jumped out of it. Then just like a big bird, he immediately flew into the sky with frightening speed and flew off into the horizon.Seeing the headmaster disappear into the horizon, Bai En let loose a sigh. \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian has really disturbed the peace this time. If he had only just beaten them, then the situation wouldn\u2019t be that bad, but he had to go and cut off Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s arm! Although it\u2019s not like the arm can\u2019t be reattached, but the strength needed for this is too high. Even the Hua Yun Sect cannot invite a rank 7 Radiant Saint Master with ease.By this point, the entire academy had heard about the three students who had their arms chopped off by Changyang Xiang Tian. It was the topic of discussion amongst every student, and with that, Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s strength had created another shock between the teachers and students.While the academy was talking about that, Jian Chen sat crossed legged on his bed as he began to reflect upon his actions. He knew in his heart that by chopping off the arms of Cheng Ming Xiang, Luo Jian, and Ka Di Yun, he had brought upon a great deal of trouble on himself. However, he didn\u2019t regret what he had done at all so all he could do right now was ponder deeply on how he could deal with the wrath of the three groups.The day went by quickly and soon became night time.\u201cDong dong dong!\u201dA loud knocking sound came from the other side of Jian Chen\u2019s room.Hearing the sound, the crossed legged Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes. Looking down to see the various Class 1 Monster Cores without energy, he sighed silently before looking towards the door, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, this is vice headmaster Chang Bai En!\u201d Came Bai En\u2019s familiar voice from outside the door.Jian Chen immediately got off his bed and walked over to open the door. Vice headmaster Chang Bai En was standing right outside his door, with an unsightly expression.\u201cVice headmaster, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jian Chen asked in a conversational tone. He already guessed what the vice headmaster had come for, but his heart was still extremely calm and unwavering.Vice headmaster Chang Bai En glanced at Jian Chen with a complicated look and sighed, \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, please pack up, then immediately follow me to the headmaster\u2019s office.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Jian Chen indifferently replied. He did not say anything afterwards, and quietly went back to his room to pack up his things.Jian Chen didn\u2019t have many belongings; he grabbed some of his own medicines and stored them into his Space Belt. Then he followed Bai En to the center of the academy where the single, lone tower stood.\u201cAh, look over there, isn\u2019t that Changyang Xiang Tian?\u201d\u201cIt is, looks like he\u2019s walking together with the vice headmaster. Maybe he received a super strict punishment\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026As they walked through the sports field, a crowd of students started to gather and chatter amongst themselves.Jian Chen turned a deaf ear to the discussions that had arisen around him. He followed behind vice headmaster Bai En, and they soon arrived at the central tower, and directly entered the headmaster\u2019s office.Right next to the vice headmaster\u2019s table sat two elders. One of them was a relieved headmaster while the other elder was wearing a cyan colored Pao and had long black hair that was tied back. From behind the desk, the old man looked quite ordinary just like any other old man.\u201cHeadmaster, Changyang Xiang Tian has been brought!\u201d Vice headmaster greeted politely.Hearing this, the headmaster\u2019s gaze immediately settled onto Jian Chen, and he said in a calm voice, \u201cBai En, you may leave!\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201d Bai En quickly left. At that moment, the only people left inside the office were Jian Chen and Kargath Academy\u2019s headmaster, as well as an elder in a blue/green robe.Ever since Jian Chen first entered, his line of vision had been fixed on the blue/green clad elder. This elder wasn\u2019t any stranger to Jian Chen; it was Changyang clan\u2019s butler \u2014\u2014 Chang Bai.\u201cChang Bai, why have you come?\u201d Jian Chen said while looking at the elder.Chang Bai gave a complicated look at Jian Chen before sighing, \u201cFourth master, from all of your days at Kargath Academy, we have been watching you and your achievements. Whether it be your mother or father, they both feel extremely proud, but this act of yours today was too impulsive.\u201dJian Chen naturally understood what Chang Bai was saying, and said firmly, \u201cChang Bai, I don\u2019t regret anything. They brought this onto themselves. My older brother hadn\u2019t offended them in any way, but they still heavily injured him. Even if I relived this experience, I would still do the same thing.\u201dChang Bai sighed, \u201cFourth master, I don\u2019t disagree with your methods, after all, in the Tian Yuan continent, it is strength that rules over others. Although their strength was weaker than yours, you did not think about the powers they had backing them up. If it was just the Ka Di clan or Luo Clan, then our Changyang Clan would not have much trouble with dealing with them, but Cheng Ming Xiang is the treasured son of the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s leader. The Hua Yun Sect holds the biggest amount of power in the Gesun Kingdom after the royal family, so this is a power the Changyang Clan cannot afford to provoke.\u201d\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian, the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s strength is quite formidable. Although they aren\u2019t as powerful as the royal family, even the royal family is afraid of any consequences from meddling with them. Currently, among the top six experts in Gesun Kingdom, the Hua Yun Sect alone takes up two of those spots.\u201d The headmaster said with a serious expression.Jian Chen\u2019s expression also gradually grew more serious at these words.At that moment, a light knock came from outside the door. A respectful voice rang out from outside, \u201cRespected headmaster, Changyang Hu has been brought!\u201d\u201cEnter!\u201d The headmaster said.The door opened, and a teacher walked in leading Changyang Hu. Changyang Hu was currently wearing a new academy uniform, but scars still clearly covered his face.\u201cChang Bai!\u201d Changyang Hu yelled the moment he walked in, he was unable to contain his emotions as he spoke with astonishment.The teacher didn\u2019t enter the headmaster\u2019s office. After sending Changyang Hu in, and sending the headmaster his respects, he lightly closed the door and left.Chang Bai\u2019s eyes lingered onto the scar on Changyang Hu\u2019s face, his pair of ordinary looking eyes finally revealed some fury in them. Without any other external movements, he spoke, \u201cEldest Master, you\u2019ve suffered greatly.\u201dChangyang Hu shook his head without any mind, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of injury, nothing major. However, Chang Bai, why did you come to the academy?\u201d Changyang Hu asked in confusion.Chang Bai\u2019s face didn\u2019t react in the slightest, and instead said gently, \u2018Eldest Master, Fourth Master, you should go pick up the rest of your things.\u201dJian Chen quietly nodded without saying a word.\u201cI\u2019ve already packed everything, Chang Bai, did you come to take me away?\u201d Changyang Hu asked in a reluctant tone.Chang Bai nodded, \u201cCorrect, I\u2019ve come today to pick you two up and depart from the academy. It would be unwise for you two to continue living at Kargath Academy.\u201dHearing this, Changyang Hu\u2019s expression became dark. He had spent quite a long time at Kargath Academy, and had already developed special feelings of attachment towards it.\u201cChangyang Hu, Changyang Xiang Tian, you two should first head out, I still have a few things I want to discuss with Chang Bai.\u201d The headmaster said.Jian Chen and Changyang Hu didn\u2019t have any objections, and they immediately turned around to walk out of the headmaster\u2019s office.Jian Chen and Changyang Hu weren\u2019t kept waiting for long; Chang Bai came out from the headmaster\u2019s office soon after. However, when he looked at the two, his faced changed to one of happiness.Jian Chen and Changyang Hu\u00a0followed Chang Bai down the tower, and got onto the flying-type magical beast to leave Kargath Academy. It directly flew up into the air, and began heading towards Lore City.Jian Chen and Changyang Hu didn\u2019t speak on the magical beast\u2019s back. While the two were being rushed home, the both of them seemed to be extremely heavy-hearted.Within Jian Chen\u2019s head, he couldn\u2019t help but to think about the motherly affections he had received. Although Jian Chen wasn\u2019t a kid in his mind, he had never dealt with such an experience before and so this motherly affection was a new thing; so Jian Chen had a very low resistance towards this.In Jian Chen\u2019s mind, he could not help but recall his previous life in the Changyang household. His mother had been wholeheartedly caring towards him, and had loved him dearly every step of his life. This made Jian Chen\u2019s frozen heart, which had never experienced a mother\u2019s love before, become a sea of warmth, and he enjoyed and treasured this feeling.Time quietly passed as the Class 4 Magical Beast soared through the air at high speeds and caused the wind to constantly whistle in Jian Chen\u2019s ear. Jian Chen\u2019s black, waist-length hair was blown messily in the air as it danced in the wind. Especially now that he had a handsome and dashing appearance, he looked as confident as ever as he rode on top of the flying magical beast with ease.The flying magical beast crossed over many different villages and cities under the guise of the pitch dark skies. After a few hours of flying a thousand kilometers above the ground, they finally arrived at Lore City.Under the control of Chang Bai, the Eagle Beast descended onto the grounds of the Changyang Mansion. The servants who managed the rear courts had long since left the area, leaving behind only the most loyal of guardsmen.A large gust of wind descended upon the courtyards as the Eagle Beast came down from the skies and landed onto the ground as the three males climbed down from it.A group of people had already gathered around the Eagle Beast with a middle aged man wearing a black and white Pao leading the group. This was the master of Changyang Mansion and the father of Jian Chen\u2013Changyang Ba. By his side were four very beautiful women\u2013 Jian Chen\u2019s mother Bi Yun Tian and his three aunts. Standing by his fourth aunt\u2019s side was a girl who looked to be around 18 years old. This was his 2nd sister he hadn\u2019t seen in a few months\u2013Changyang Ming Yue. Standing right next to her was another person who looked to be around Jian Chen\u2019s age; it was Changyang Ke, his third brother. However, in Changyang Ke\u2019s eyes was a look of mirth as if he was happy to see Jian Chen in such misery after leaving Kargath Academy.Standing behind the family were a few middle aged men and elders, they were high ranking members of the clan, but each one of them had a grave expression on their faces as they looked at Jian Chen with a complicated stare. Some looked at him with happiness, others with an expectant expression, and some who just sighed.Chang Bai walked towards Changyang Ba and gave a small smile, \u201cClan leader, I have not failed you. I have brought the eldest master and fourth master back home safely.\u201d He stated.Changyang Ba looked at Chang Bai and clasped his hands together, \u201cChang Bai, thank you very much for your trouble.\u201d\u201cClan leader is being too courteous, this is just part of my duty.\u201d Chang Bai said.Changyang Ba swept his gaze across Jian Chen and Changyang Hu. His eyes held both expressions of gratification and admiration as he looked at Jian Chen, and his expression had also become excited, although it was still nevertheless worried. Finally, he let out a long sigh and said, \u201cXiang Er, Ah Hu, both of you come with me to the main hall.\u201d Changyang Ba turned around and began to walk out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a good thing fourth brother found me, otherwise, your child would have been left unable to even move from bed.\u201dHearing this, Jing Long turned her head to look at Jian Chen with a gentle smile on her face, \u201cXiang Tian, I really must thank you for helping Ah Hu.\u201dJian Chen smiled back, \u201cEldest aunt, what are you saying? If my big brother has a problem, of course I\u2019d help. Besides, this happened because of me and big brother was caught up into it. As long as eldest aunt doesn\u2019t blame me, then I\u2019be happy enough.\u201dJing Long still had a smile on her face, \u201cXiang Tian, you\u2019re becoming more and more intelligent. You\u2019re almost becoming just like Ah Hu now.\u201d\u201cPraise from eldest aunt!\u201d Jian Chen laughed, he could clearly tell that eldest aunt Jing Long\u2019s attitude towards him had improved. She was no longer so solemn and unmoving towards him.No longer was she like before, always wearing a neutral face.\u201cMother, you should say it right: fourth brother\u2019s strength is really amazing! Before he was even a Saint, he could easily hunt and kill Class 2 Magical Beasts. And after he did become one, even the combined powers of the geniuses of cultivation of Kargath Academy \u2013despite having the genius Upper Saint Cheng Ming Xiang among their ranks\u2013 were beaten in under three minutes. The ten other who followed them were also easily beaten up by fourth brother as well.\u201d Changyang Hu was clearly excited, his voice was rising in volume as he spoke. \u201cMother, you didn\u2019t see the fight, but I did. Although fourth brother was by himself, he had beaten a dozen people until they were covered with bruises in the blink of an eye. These dozen people were all at the rank of a Saint at the very least, but against fourth brother, they were no match at all.\u201dHearing this, Jian Chen\u2019s mother Bi Yun Tian beamed with happiness as she looked at her son with loving affection.\u201cHmph!\u2019A cold sneer came from the side. It was from Jian Chen\u2019s third aunt\u2013Bai Yu Shuang who continued to say, \u201cAmazing is amazing, but it was this amazingness that provoked the Hua Yun Sect. Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s amazingness is practically inviting danger to our Changyang Mansion.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s eyebrows furrowed together. His third aunt Bai Yu Shuang had always treated him with prejudice since he was young. Jian Chen\u2019s mother, Bi Yun Tian was extremely discontent. However, the one that had caused trouble was her own son, and even she slightly felt that he was in the wrong. In addition, his relationship with Bai Yu Shuang was never good. Thus, she couldn\u2019t claim he wasn\u2019t guilty either, otherwise the little feud between the two would only grow.\u201cForget it, third sister. What\u2019s happened has already happened. Discussing it now isn\u2019t of any use. What we should do now is to properly consider how we should deal with it.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s second aunt Yu Feng Yan explained.\u201cForget it, third sister. After all, Xiang Tian stirred up this trouble for the sake of saving Ah Hu. You can\u2019t blame everything on Xiang Tian.\u201d Jing Long sided with Jian Chen.Seeing that there were actually two people supporting Jian Chen, Bai Yu Shuang could only snort, and stay silent.Bi Yun Tian sighed, her gaze held both love and worry as she looked at Jian Chen and said, \u201cXiang Er, we know of all of your achievements at Kargath Academy. You are my pride and glory, but I also think that your actions this time were too brash. To think that you even cut off the Hu Yun Sect Leader\u2019s son\u2019s arm. Do you know that with this, you\u2019ve not only caused major trouble for yourself, but you\u2019ve also dragged the entire Changyang clan in with you as well?\u201dA trace of guilt was shown on Jian Chen\u2019s face as he said, \u201cSorry mother, I have brought a great trouble to our clan.\u201d\u201cXiang Tian, what happened has already happened. You should stop blaming yourself. Right now we need to go the main hall quickly to discuss how to settle this conflict.\u201d Second aunt then closed her mouth.After that, the group started to pick up their pace as they headed towards the main hall.At this moment within a splendid palace, the emperor of Gesun Kingdom held a letter in the middle of his hands. Creasing together his eyebrows, he let out a long sigh before saying, \u201cThis Changyang Xiang Tian is truly too impulsive, he has made a great mistake by cutting off the right arm of the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s Cheng Ming Xiang. This type of situation is something the Changyang Clan cannot stand up against.\u201dThe emperor released the letter and watched it drop to the table, \u201cServant, call the Armored Forces commander Bi Dao to come quickly.\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty!\u201dAs the emperor gave out his command, the court eunuch hurried out to obey his orders.Soon enough, a black armored middle aged man came walking into the room. This man\u2019s appearance was rather ordinary looking but he had a resolute expression on his face. His eyes shined brightly below his scarred face. The scars ran across his entire forehead, causing people to jump at his terrifying appearance.The man walked towards the emperor before stopping 10 meters away from him. \u201cYour Majesty, this servant knows not why he has been called here.\u201dThe emperor slowly stood up as he grabbed the letter in his hand and handed it to the man. \u201cTake a look!\u201dHearing this, the middle-aged male wearing black armor received the letter from the emperor and opened it to begin reading. After he finished, his expression had become extremely heavy.\u201cAi, I hadn\u2019t imagined that he would actually stir up so much trouble.\u201d The black-armored man let out a long sigh as his expression became anxious.\u201cThe younger generations always seem to be so arrogant and impulsive.\u201d The emperor sighed, \u201cBi Dao, ever since you joined the Armored Forces twenty years ago, you\u2019ve never returned back to your homeland. Take this opportunity today and visit.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201d A complex look flashed in the armored youth\u2019s eyes.The emperor\u2019s expression suddenly turned serious as he said, \u201cBi Dao, when you return this time, you must persuade Changyang clan\u2019s people to send Changyang Xiang Tian over here as quickly as possible. Otherwise, once the Hua Yun Sect goes looking for them, the conflict will grow even more. Only by sending Changyang Xiang Tian away, in addition to us mediating between them, will the conflict between the Changyang clan and the Hua Yun Sect be temporarily stabilized. Right now, all of the neighboring nations are already beginning to stir. It seems that they\u2019ve never let go of the idea of attacking my Gesen Kingdom\u2019s territory. At a moment as critical as this, nothing can be allowed to occur within the Kingdom. Otherwise, the end result will be too horrible to even think about.\u201d\u201cChangyang Xiang Tian is a genius from the heavens with unlimited potential. His future prospects truly cannot be measured, may be the only source of hope that Gesun Kingdom has ever had in the last few hundred years. For this reason, Changyang Xiang Tian must be protected at all costs. Although we cannot guarantee his future achievements will go smoothly,we cannot allow him to get involved in an accident within our Gesun Kingdom.\u201d The emperor spoke with a hard face.Hearing this, the armored youth showed a proud and joyous expression. He suppressed the rising emotions within his heart and said, \u201cYoung Majesty, Bi Dao understands what he should do now.\u201dThe emperor nodded his head and said, \u201cBi Dao, there\u2019s no time to lose. You must head out to Changyang Mansion immediately. With your strength, you should be able to arrive there before sunrise.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u2026\u2026.Within the great halls of the Changyang Mansion, Changyang Ba sat down onto his throne, with Jian Chen on one side and his fellow wives on the other side. Sitting a few steps below was the relieved housekeeper Chang Bai.Changyang Ba had a look of worry on his face as he looked at his son Jian Chen. \u201cXiang Er\u2019s situation at Kargath Academy should be known to everyone here already; The Hua Yun Sect leader\u2019s son had his right arm cut off, so the Hua Yun Sect will definitely not let this matter go. Please offer up what solutions you may have.\u201dHearing this, everyone in the hall went silent. The Hua Yun Sect was the biggest force of power aside from the royal family in the Gesun Kingdom and didn\u2019t fear the emperor\u2019s power at all. The Changyang Clan wouldn\u2019t be able to resist their sect since Cheng Ming Xiang was like a treasured son of the sect leader. Since he was a genius that far exceeded the others, to have his arm chopped off by Jian Chen would definitely influence his future road of achievements. It could be said with no exaggeration that Jian Chen had completely destroyed Cheng Ming Xiang. So for that reason everyone knew within their hearts that there would be no way for the Hua Yun Sect to forgive this matter.Everyone was still silent before finally a 60 year old elder said, \u201cThe best way to solve this problem is to find and invite a Radiant Saint Master to help repair Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s arm. However, only a Rank 7 Radiant Saint Master would have the power to do something on this level, our Changyang Clan would not be able to easily call on such a person. Not only that, but Rank 7 Radiant Saint Masters are extremely rare within the Tian Yuan continent and many of them are wanderers. It would be easier to climb to the heavens than to find one, so the possibility of healing Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s arm is practically zero.\u201d\u201cAi, what you\u2019re saying is correct. In my opinion, our only chance of appeasing the anger of the Hua Yun Sect aside from finding a Radiant Saint Master is to have the Emperor and the royal family back us up. However, the Hua Yun Sect would definitely not give up their chances. What is guaranteed is that the fourth master will not be easy to protect.\u201d A middle aged person said.Standing by the middle aged man were a few other elders who had high amounts of influence within the clan. They have long since heard about Jian Chen\u2019s achievements within the academy, and in their hearts, they had already started to place their hopes for the clan\u2019s survivals onto Jian Chen. So even though the clan was being troubled by a big problem, no one had blamed him for it and instead tried their best to find ways to protect him. Not only that but with the arranged marriage between him and Princess Ge Lan, then after the marriage, the Changyang Clan would be able to rise higher in power.\u201cIf only the Ancestor was still here.\u201d An elder sighed helplessly.Hearing this, Chang Bai\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s right, if the master was here, then our clan wouldn\u2019t need to assemble here today to figure out a solution. It\u2019s a shame, the master has already been gone for dozens of years without any notice. We don\u2019t even know if he is alive or not.\u201dThe crowd went silent after hearing that.Jian Chen\u2019s heart pulsed after hearing Chang Bai talk. From his few years at the Changyang Mansion, he had never once heard about this Ancestor or Chang Bai\u2019s master come up as a topic before. Although he had only just heard about the two, he was sure in his heart that these two people were actually very strong and had power incomparable to anyone else. Most likely the two were not afraid of the Hua Yun Sect and were former elders of the clan.Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to think about his question long, and immediately dismissed it from his mind. Seeing how the hall was still silent, Jian Chen hesitated slightly before saying, \u201cFather, it would be better for Chang Bai\u2019s Eagle Beast to send me out. As long as I do not remain within Changyang Mansion, I am sure the Hua Yun Sect will not act upon the clan if they truly do come.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not!!\u201dThe moment Jian Chen spoke, Bi Yun Tian and Changyang Ba\u2019s voices both simultaneously rose up in objection.Both of Bi Yun Tian\u2019s hands tightly grasped onto Jian Chen\u2019s own hands as her eyes gradually became misty before tears started to stream down her face. She cried, \u201cXiang Er, don\u2019t say such foolish things! The Tian Yuan continent is very dangerous, and it\u2019s not as easygoing as you think it is. You have not yet explored the world, so you don\u2019t know what rules must be followed in order to survive. Your strength is still to low, Mother will definitely not let you go on such a foolish endeavor!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The world isn\u2019t as peaceful as the academy is; it\u2019s filled with slaughter. And with your current strength, being able to survive won\u2019t be that easy. Forget about this idea, I absolutely won\u2019t agree to it.\u201d Changyang Ba said seriously. Although he spoke in an ordinary tone, he had been firm in rejecting Jian Chen\u2019s idea.Jian Chen already knew that it would be hard to get his family to agree to this plan, but he continued to speak, \u201cFather, mother, please don\u2019t worry about me. Your son may not be strong, but I am still able to protect myself. I\u2019ve read many books from the academy library, and so I have some familiarity on how to survive within the Tian Yuan continent. Once your child leaves Changyang Mansion, then that\u2019ll be one less problem for the clan.\u201d\u201cFourth master, the situation isn\u2019t as simple as you think. If the Hua Yun Sect were to find out that you are no longer within the Changyang Mansion, then I\u2019m afraid that they would send out many of their numbers to pursue you. And with the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s power, you won\u2019t be hard to locate.\u201d A white haired elder spoke, in his heart, he had placed Jian Chen as the hope for the clan\u2019s future, and definitely did not want to see him die prematurely.He was a 15 year old Saint who was stronger than an Upper level Saint, and bordered along the powers of a Great Saint. This meant that he was a genius from the heavens that would shake the entire Tian Yuan continent. To some of the men here, Jian Chen was no longer just a regular person, but a glowing human treasure that could give them boundless wealth.For that reason within the hearts of the high ranked elders, they all just wanted to protect Jian Chen so he wouldn\u2019t suffer a blow to his future potential.Jian Chen let loose a big smile, \u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t need to worry, I\u2019ve read up about a lot about the continent, so I\u2019m sure that I can keep away from the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s grasp.\u201d\u201cDefinitely not, Xiang Er. This is still too risky, it\u2019s not worth the trouble.\u201d Changyang Ba immediately shot down the proposal. \u201cXiang Er, don\u2019t worry about a thing. While the Hua Yun Sect may be very strong, our Changyang Clan won\u2019t be such an easy pushover, and although our Ancestor has been gone for some years, his reputation is still widely known. The Hua Yun Sect wouldn\u2019t dare to be so forward with our clan. So just stay within the mansion, I will do my best to protect you.\u201dJian Chen inwardly sighed to himself. With such a resolute objection, there would be no way for him to convince his father otherwise.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Xiang Er, this idea of yours is far too risky. Even if you could escape from the Hua Yun Sect, the life of the Tian Yuan continent is not as straightforward and simple as the books say. Please just obediently stay at Changyang Mansion; your father and your uncles will do their best to protect you.\u201d Bi Yun Tian gently pleaded with Jian Chen.\u201cKe!\u201d Changyang Ba cleared his voice, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s first talk about how we\u2019ll deal with the Hua Yun Sect. I\u2019m sure they have already heard about this situation and will arrive at Lore City soon, so we are pressed for time.\u201d Changyang Ba stated once more.The entire crowd within the main hall went silent as they all started to think about the situation.\u201cIf His Majesty helps us, then that means the arranged wedding between the fourth master and Princess Ge Lan is still on. So in the end, the fourth master will still be the son-in-law to the emperor, so I\u2019m sure His Majesty won\u2019t sit around and do nothing.\u201d Someone said.Chang Bai nodded his head in contemplation and said, \u201cIf His Majesty wants to support us, then he could temporarily suppress this situation, but this will no doubt bring His Majesty quite a headache. It is unfortunate timing right now as well; the neighboring countries have been inconspicuously sending soldiers to the borders. Most likely, they want to invade the richly fertile lands of the Gesun Kingdom. So right now, His Majesty definitely would not want to get onto the bad side of the Hua Yun Sect; after all, this is a matter of life or death for the kingdom. Without the two Heaven\u00a0Saint Master\u2019s from the Hua Yun Sect, even the strongest fighters would be hard pressed to fight against the other kingdom soldiers.\u201d\u201cAlthough the fourth master has a very strong potential, and also has high expectations from His Majesty, the fourth master\u2019s future achievements currently cannot be confirmed. Not only that, but the fourth master is still young, so there is still a long time before he can fully mature. With the kingdom on the verge of a war, there is simply not enough time for them to wait around for the fourth master, since we\u2019re not sure how long it\u2019ll be before the kingdom either wins or loses. The kingdom will need as many strong Saints as possible in order to help win the war, so it\u2019s not clear if His Majesty will help us or not.\u201dThe people in the main hall continued to attempt to come up with other ways. However, despite having contemplated for an entire evening, they were still unable to come up with any workable method.The night flew by quickly under the strained atmosphere the dozen people were in. The sky had already began to brighten; it was already close to dawn. After an entire night of discussion, everyone\u2019s expressions looked exhausted.At this moment, a Changyang Clan patrolman came running in, \u201cReporting to the clan leader, there is a person named Bi Dao waiting outside the mansion who wishes to see you.\u201d\u201cBi Dao!\u201d Changyang Ba exclaimed under his breath with a contemplative look. His eyes shined brightly as he stood up from his throne, \u201cQuickly invite him in!\u201d\u201cYessir!\u201d The guard responded, and quickly left.Hearing the name of Bi Dao, Bi Yun Tian started to tremble from where she was standing with a look of happiness. But soon that look changed into one of puzzlement.Jian Chen became confused as he noticed the change in his mother\u2019s expression. He had never heard of Bi Dao before, however, judging from his mother\u2019s reaction, this Bi Dao most likely had some type of relationship with his mother.Jian Chen slowly approached his mother before asking, \u201cMother, who is this Bi Dao person?\u201dBi Yun Tian slowly turned around, her eyes looking at her adored son, \u201cXiang Er, mother will tell you about this in a bit.\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d Jian Chen nodded and did not inquire any further.Not too long after, a black robed male came in with long strides. The man had a determined look on his face and his eyes refused to stop shining with energy. Looking at the man\u2019s forehead, many different scars could be seen.Changyang Ba stopped his actions and walked up to the center of the discussion hall. He greeted and smiled, \u201cBrother Bi Dao, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 20 years since we last met. How have you been?\u201dThe middle-aged man named Bi Dao greeted back and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been okay.\u201d He paused for a moment, his gaze stopping on Jian Chen and his mother, before continuing, \u201cIt\u2019s probably better if I just get straight to the point. I\u2019ve come this time under the the emperor\u2019s orders. At the same time, I\u2019ve come to transmit his orders!\u201dHearing this, Changyan Ba\u2019s face became solemn as he asked, \u201cBrother Bi Dao, could this concern Xiang Er as well?\u201dBi Dao nodded his head, \u201cThat\u2019s right, His Majesty has allowed your Changyang Xiang Tian to be escorted far away from Lore City. Only by doing this will the conflict between Changyang Mansion and the Hua Yun Sect be temporarily abated.\u201dChangyang Ba furrowed his eyebrows together. In his heart, he did not want to follow along with this solution.Bi Dao continued, \u201cThe trouble this time really is a bit too great. Cheng Ming Xiang is Hua Yun Sect\u2019s only son, and he\u2019s a talented person that will eventually become Hua Yun Sect\u2019s next leader. For Changyang Xiang Tian to have cut off Cheng Ming Xiang\u2019s right arm destroyed him without question. Thus, the Hua Yun Sect will definitely not let this matter drop lightly.\u201d\u201cThe Hua Yun Sect has two Heaven\u00a0Saint Masters; people that the Changyang Clan cannot afford to fight with. Although His Majesty also has two other Heaven\u00a0Saint Masters by his side, but with trouble brewing at the borders of the country, then the Gesun Kingdom will be involved in a war soon enough. By that point, His Majesty cannot afford to get on the bad side of the Hua Yun Sect. It is only with Changyang Xiang Tian being escorted out of Lore City and under the control of His Majesty that this situation can be solved temporarily, and fix the issues within the Gesun Kingdom.\u201d\u201cCould it be that there\u2019s really no other way?\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s second aunt, Yu Feng Yan asked.\u201cNone!\u201d Bi Dao shook his head, his tone filled with complete certainty.Bi Yun Tian\u2019s expression turned ashen, and she said in a trembling voice, \u201cHowever, the people outside are dangerous. Xiang Er\u2019s strength is still weak; he\u2019ll definitely suffer through a lot of hardships.\u201dBi Dao gave a profound look at the Jian Chen sitting next to Bi Yun Tian and said, \u201cOne must suffer hardships in their life while upholding their dignity as a person. It is only after they suffer through thick and thin that they can mature into an independent person.. You both pamper him too much; this won\u2019t do him any favors, it\u2019s actually harming him.\u201dHearing Bi Dao, a few of the gathered people nodded their heads in agreement. There was a great deal of logic within his words.Changyang Ba still looked hesitant at this idea.Jian Chen swept his gaze over his surroundings. He knew that this was his chance to strike out for an advantage and said, \u201cFather, just let me leave. I am confident that I can cope with anything that I\u2019ll encounter in the future. Moreover, I really want to go outside to travel the world.\u201d\u201cClan leader, since the fourth master had originally planned to leave the mansion, what Bi Dao said is correct. This may be the only way to solve the conflict between the two groups. With this method, the fourth master will definitely learn a lot. Even if the fourth master is a genius that surpasses others, his experience is still what matters most.\u201d Chang Bai said.Changyang Ba helplessly sighed and said, \u201cFine. Since Chang Bai also agrees to this suggestion, then Xiang Er will leave Lore City and experience the outside world for a while. I\u2019ll let a few devoted guards leave with Xiang Er to keep him safe outside.\u201dOnce he heard that guards would be dispatched to protect him, Jian Chen\u2019s brows couldn\u2019t help but knit together as he said, \u201cFather, there\u2019s no need to dispatch guards. I want to go adventure outside alone.\u201d\u201cXiang Er, going out by yourself is still far too dangerous. At the very least, please take some guards to go with you in case you come across any trouble.\u201d Bi Yun Tian held onto Jian Chen\u2019s hands in concern. With the current matters, she was powerless to change the decision and so she could only try to accept this decision calmly.\u201cNo need, mother. I don\u2019t want to bring guards out; if that happens, I\u2019ll be too easy to target. I think that going out alone is easier.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s attitude was extremely firm. In reality, in his opinion, having a few guards by his side was a type of burden. In addition, once outside, he couldn\u2019t always be as cautious with conserving his strength as he was at home. He still had many secrets that he couldn\u2019t let anyone in his family know of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So in the end, Changyang Ba had no choice but to agree.After the discussions were over, Bi Dao said, \u201cFrom what I heard in the royal palace, the Hua Yun Sect has already received the news and is moving towards Lore City at top speed. They\u2019ll be at Lore City by late afternoon at the very latest, so it would be best if you send Changyang Xiang Tian away from Lore City as soon as possible. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be too late by nighttime.\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces became solemn once more. Then, Chang Bai stood up and said, \u201cThen let\u2019s have the fourth master gather his things before I take him away on the Eagle Beast.\u201dSoon after that, everyone started to leave the main hall.\u201cXiang Er, please go to mother\u2019s room; there are matters we must discuss.\u201d Bi Yun Tian said as she walked towards her room.After entering her room, Bi Yun Tian pulled Jian Chen with her to sit with him. By this point, Bi Yun Tian\u2019s cheeks had tears streaming down her face. She knew in her heart that after Jian Chen left Changyang Mansion, it would be a very long time before the mother and son would be able to meet again. Life in the Tian Yuan Continent was complex, and Jian Chen didn\u2019t know what hardships he would go through or what unfortunate events would happen to him, so this was possibly the last time the mother and son would ever see each other again.\u201cXiang Er, you are no longer young in age and you\u2019ll soon be leaving this place. So there are things that mother should tell you first.\u201d Bi Yun Tian\u2019s tears shone like sparkling crystals as they dripped from her face, \u201cXiang Er, didn\u2019t you ever think why it was strange that you didn\u2019t have a grandfather or grandmother?\u201dJian Chen nodded his head without making a sound.Bi Yun Tian continued to say, \u201cXiang Er, your mother is actually not from the Gesun Kingdom. My homelands originate from one of three biggest empires: the Karl Empire. Not only that, but my Bi Clan has been a powerful family that goes back for over a thousand years. It had a powerful influence stronger than that of the Hua Yun Sect and resided in the King City Ming Huo City. Your grandfather was a powerful Saint Ruler, while you have four other great elders who have reached the Heaven Saint Master level and hold high positions in our Bi Clan.\u201dBi Yun Tian sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame good things don\u2019t last forever. While your mother was still young, your grandfather received a letter and never returned, leaving behind no information at all. 20 years after the disappearance of your grandfather, the four elders of the clan sent two people to look for him. Two days after their search began however, an astonishing piece of information was reported; the two that were sent out had been killed in the countryside!\u201d Bi Yun Tian\u2019s face was full of sorrow after saying that.\u201cThis piece of information was like a bolt of lightning coming from a clear sky. While the two elders were only at the Heaven Saint Master level, they were still considered as some of the strongest in the Tian Yuan Continent, so it was inconceivable to think that they could be killed. The elders didn\u2019t even have time to run, and so to this day, the Bi Clan are still clueless on what enemy could be strong enough to have such a grudge towards our Bi Clan; your grandfather may have encountered something similar as well.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, our mysterious enemies didn\u2019t even give us time to catch our breath. On the very same night of the murders, a huge group of mysterious men invaded our Bi Clan. They were all very strong, and the remaining two elders were unable to repel them; ultimately, they got killed. Without the powerful elders, there were no longer any strong people left to protect us. At that moment, some loyal members of the clan tried to help a group of us escape the massacre, but in the end, only your mother and uncle were left. It was only after your uncle and I hid in a family home that we were able to escape from Ming Huo City with our lives.\u201d\u201cAfter hiding for a few hours, we turned our heads and immediately left via a mercenary caravan heading towards the Gesun Kingdom.\u201dThe tears were still flowing from Bi Yun Tian\u2019s face as she cried in deep sorrow, \u201cXiang Er, at that moment of greatness, we had over a thousand members to our name. But to this day, all that remains is your uncle and the two of us. You must remember that you not only have the blood of the Changyang clan in you, but the blood of the Bi Clan as well. You must carry on the Bi Clan\u2019s name, so please remember to protect yourself. Do you understand?\u201dJian Chen nodded his head in silence as his heart churned with emotions. For a very long time he couldn\u2019t calm himself, since the news his mother had told him had struck the very core of his emotions.After some time, Jian Chen finally calmed himself down and said, \u201cMother, could it be that we still haven\u2019t figured out our mysterious enemy\u2019s identity or how strong they are?\u201dBi Yun Tian shook her head, \u201cI have no idea. Your mother and uncle were still young at the time and so we didn\u2019t understand much. So we had no idea who they were. If anyone knew, it would be the elders, but they\u2019re dead now.\u201dAfterwards, Bi Yun Tian fished out a red embroidered pouch and looked it as if it was bringing back old memories. \u201cXiang Er, before your grandfather disappeared, he gave me this red pouch and said it was a family heirloom passed down from generation to generation. By this point, it\u2019s well over a thousand years old so please take care of it. Those mysterious men had most likely exterminated our Bi Clan for treasures like this.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s eyes looked at the embroidered red pouch and said, \u201cMother, what exactly is in this then?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only a small piece of fur that\u2019s smaller than the size of one\u2019s palms inside. Your mother has no idea what it\u2019s used for.\u201d Bi Yun Tian placed the red pouch onto Jian Chen\u2019s hands and said, \u201cXiang Er, even if this pouch only has fur in it, it\u2019s still a family heirloom, so there\u2019s no way this piece of fur is not simple at all. Right now you are the Bi Clan\u2019s only hope, so passing down the family heirloom should be a given. I hope you protect yourself well, but it\u2019s best if you keep this pouch hidden at all costs. Although it\u2019ll be unlikely to come across a person that recognizes it, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\u201dJian Chen silently nodded as he took the red pouch.\u201cDong dong dong!\u201dAt that moment, a knock was heard on the door as a voice called out from the other side. Quickly wiping away her tears, Bi Yun Tian called out, \u201cWho is it?\u201dThere was no sound outside the door for some time. Eventually, a voice said, \u201cSister, it\u2019s me.\u201dHearing that familiar voice, one that he had not too long ago heard, Jian Chen stared blanky at the door. It was the man from the palace: Bi Dao.Hearing the voice, Bi Yun Tian looked puzzled before saying, \u201cCome in.\u201dThe doors opened as a black robed man slowly walked in; it was precisely Bi Dao.Bi Yun Tian slowly stood up from her chair as she looked at him with a pained expression. \u201cBrother, it has been 20 years since you last saw me. I had thought that you had already forgotten about me.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s stare hardened. From the fact that his mother called him her brother, he could already tell that the middle-aged man in front of him was his uncle.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d Bi Dao sighed. \u201cSister, I\u2019m sorry, your older brother was wrong to not visit you during the last 20 years. In truth, your brother never forgot about you, it was just that the burdens your brother was carrying were too heavy to bear. Vengeance for our Bi Clan will definitely be carried out by me. Sister! Your brother will live out the rest of his life for the sole purpose of revenge..\u201dBi Yun Tian sighed as well, before turning her head to look at Jian Chen, \u201cXiang Er, this is your uncle\u2014\u2014Bi Dao.\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d Jian Chen spoke. This was the first time he had uttered the word, as well as the first time he had seen him up close.Bi Dao sized up Jian Chen before offering a smile, \u201cXiang Tian, I have heard about you; word of your accomplishments has resounded through the capital, and have even been whispered of inside the royal palace. You are truly worthy of being a descendant of our Bi Clan. I eagerly anticipate the day when you have grown strong and honorable. Do not disappoint me.After talking, Bi Dao immediately grew solemn once more as he faced Bi Yun Tian, \u201cSister, I know you hate to see Xiang Tian leave, but there is no other way. As it stands now, the Changyang Clan cannot oppose the Hua Yun Sect, but if Xiang Tian leaves, the situation will improve dramatically for both the Clan and Xiang Tian. Letting Xiang Tian stay in the Mansion will bring no good benefits. It may even cause the Changyang Clan to end up like our Bi Clan. Right now we just need to smuggle Xiang Tian away before nightfall. Otherwise, he won\u2019t be able to leave, even if you agreed to let him go.\u201dBi Yun Tian nodded her head slowly. Since the emperor wasn\u2019t willing to help them publically right now, how could she not understand this reasoning?Afterwards, the tear-streaked Bi Yun Tian helped Jian Chen gather some clothes and items before escorting him out.As the two of them arrived at the rear courtyard, they found Jian Chen\u2019s aunts, his father, and Chang Bai were there waiting for him. Right behind them stood a gigantic and majestic, Eagle Beast .Changyang Hu grabbed Jian Chen\u2019s arm, his expression downtrodden as he spoke with concern, \u201cFourth brother, you\u2019d better be careful in the outside world, understand?\u201dJian Chen nodded before saying with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big brother, I will definitely protect myself. But after I go, you\u2019d better not goof off. You must continue practicing the battle techniques..\u201dChangyang Hu nodded his head fiercely and said, \u201cI will, fourth brother. Your elder brother\u2019s lack of strength has burdened you. From now on, I will strive even harder to cultivate and grow stronger.\u201dJian Chen\u2019s second sister, Changyang Ming Yue, walked up to him and gave him a spice bag, \u201cFourth brother, your second sister made you a safety charms and wishes you safe travels. You\u2019d better wear it.\u201dRight now, Changyang Ming Yue was already 18. She had become a tall yet slender beautiful girl that was capable of causing an entire city to fight for her.Jian Chen took the safety charm from her. Although he knew that the charm wouldn\u2019t provide any substantial amount of defense, it was still a gift from his sister that was filled with concern.\u201cThank you, second sister. I will definitely take care of this charm.\u201d He said with a smile.Changyang Ba walked forward with a ring and spoke, \u201cXiang Er, this is a Space Ring your father had long since prepared for you. This was meant to be your graduation present from Kargath Academy, but I don\u2019t believe you need to wait that long for it anymore. Your father will give you this Space Ring; there is already something I have prepared for you inside.\u201d\u201cThank you, father!\u201d With a grateful look, Jian Chen took the Space Ring.\u201cXiang Er, the Space Ring is absolutely a precious item within the Tian Yuan Continent. In order to avoid unnecessary troubles, don\u2019t reveal your Space Ring to anyone, even under the most dire circumstances.\u201d Changyang Ba said.Jian Chen nodded, \u201cFather, Xiang Er understands.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s been over 15 years since he came into this world, and he has only left the confines of the Mansion and Lore City twice.The first time he had left Lore City was to go to Kargath Academy, but this time, the reason was no longer the same. Jian Chen understood that after leaving, he wouldn\u2019t see his family again for a very long time, and would have to fend for himself. In this dangerous environment known as the Tian Yuan continent, Jian Chen could only rely on himself. Jian Chen personally didn\u2019t think he would be able to see his family again, but he had read from the books that this world was dominated by the strong. The Tian Yuan continent was a lot more dangerous than his previous world, and while he had decent strength for his age, there was no guarantee for what may happen.Chang Bai sat on the neck of the Eagle Beast and stared at Jian Chen, \u201cFourth master, starting from today you\u2019ll be on your own.. Please be careful as you travel through the Tian Yuan continent.\u201d\u201cI know what must be done, Chang Bai.\u201d Jian Chen said without turning his head.Chang Bai paused to look at Jian Chen with a curious look before sighing as he had no more to say.The Eagle Beast flew high in the sky, thousands of meters above the ground, streaking across the sky like a ray of light . With the whistle of the wind blowing loudly, both Chang Bai and Jian Chen had their hair and clothes flapping rapidly in the wind.The Eagle Beast soared over the walls of countless tiny villages before finally the Eagle Beast slowly came to a stop, in midair in front of the walls of a great city.Looking down to see the city, Jian Chen asked, \u201cChang Bai, you should just drop me off here.\u201dHearing this, Chang Bai looked down to see the tiny city before nodding his head, \u201cIf you say so!\u201d Immediately, the Eagle Beast flew down towards the ground under his control.Jian Chen hopped off of the magical beast before saying to Chang Bai, \u201cChang Bai, you should hurry on home, I\u2019m sure the Hua Yun Sect has already arrived at the Changyang Mansion.\u201dChang Bai started to ascend with his Eagle Beast, \u201cFourth master, please take care.\u201dJian Chen waved goodbye to Chang Bai and turned around to walk towards the city in front of him.Chang Bai hesitated as he sat on the Eagle Beast and watched Jian Chen\u2019s back go further and further away. It was only after he had disappeared when Chang Bai said, \u201cFourth master, I hope we see each other soon, you\u2019ve always surprised me after all.\u201d The Eagle Beast started to flap its wings and flew into the sky, blowing dust everywhere. Soon, Chang Bai flew off into the air towards the direction of the Changyang Mansion.The sun has already long since set into the horizon. With the colors of nightfall rapidly approaching, Jian Chen walked towards the small city with a group of people, however while he was walking on foot, many of them were traveling via carriages being pulled by magical beasts.Jian Chen\u2019s appearance had naturally made the other travelers curious and made many other mercenaries become alert. But when they realized how young Jian Chen was, they immediately lost their alertness.Jian Chen sized up the mercenaries riding on top of the magical beasts. Some of them ranged from 20 years old to 50 years old; some wore armor, some leather, and some just wore regular clothes. When Jian Chen walked closer to them however, he could smell the scent of blood. To the experienced Jian Chen, he knew that these mercenaries had been baptized with the blood of their enemies already.10 miles wasn\u2019t that far for Jian Chen, and so after some time, he saw the 20 meter high city walls. Jian Chen didn\u2019t know how old the walls were, but the constant battle with time seemed to have left it\u2019s mark on them. Visible scars could be seen on the walls, but near the gate written with bold calligraphy were the words\u2013White Cloud City.\u201cHey, halt. What is your purpose here?\u201dBarring Jian Chen\u2019s path was a guard of the city.Jian Chen gave a small smile and handed the guard a few Gold Coins and said, \u201cBrother, I am merely a mercenary who came to White Cloud City for a mission.\u201dThe guard took the gold coins discretely and smiled brightly at him, \u201cAh, so you have a mission, then I won\u2019t take up your precious time, go on in.\u201dAfter entering the city, Jian Chen walked three kilometers down the road, and arrived at a very busy part of the city. Although it was sunset, the street was still bustling with people rushing around from store to store and engaged in every sort of business.The streets were paved with rocks that seemed to shine brightly. With the road so evenly paved, even if a caravan ran full speed across it, the passengers wouldn\u2019t feel the slightest jolt.Hungry, Jian Chen rubbed his stomach gingerly as he walked towards the nearest restaurant. It had already been a full day since he had eaten, so his stomach had already started to protest.\u201cWelcome, guest!\u201dUnder the enthusiastic welcome of a waiter, Jian Chen walked towards an empty table and sat down.\u201cHonored guest, are you here for a meal or to stay for the night?\u201d The waiter was a young man in his 20s, and had a cordial smile on his face.Jian Chen looked at the other rowdy mercenaries within the restaurant and said, \u201cEven those who are staying for the night require a meal, what is there to eat here?\u201dThe waiter smiled and introduced Jian Chen to a wide variety of dishes, however every single one of the dishes mentioned were all the most expensive dishes. The waiter had long since noticed Jian Chen was wearing quite luxurious clothes and thought him out to be the son of a wealthy clan.But Jian Chen didn\u2019t care for the prices of the dishes and instead lazily chose one out to eat.After eating his fill, Jian Chen paid for a medium sized room for the night and immediately entered his room to rest.The restaurant was not a very high quality one, so the medium sized room was not too luxurious. Compared to the Changyang Mansion, the difference was like comparing the heavens to the earth. The room offered a hardwood bed with a single table and a few chairs, but apart from that, there was nothing more. On a side note, the room had been cleaned nicely.Jian Chen had never been picky, and so this room had already satisfied him enough.After closing his door, Jian Chen walked towards his bed and took out the Space Ring his father had given him before leaving and looked at the contents.The Space Ring deserved to be called a high quality treasure as there were many objects within it. With an internal storage of up to a hundred cubic\u00a0meters, there were a pile of items stacked in the middle of it. While the ring wasn\u2019t full, almost every inch of the floor had been covered by items.Amongst a pile of items, there were a thousand Purple Coins that sparkled dazzlingly along with another few thousand Gold Coins stacked in another pile. There were even small piles of monster cores, around 40 of them were Class 2 Monster Cores, 10 of them were Class 3 Monster Cores, and only 1 of them was a Class 4 Monster Core.Seeing how many items were stored inside the Space Ring, Jian Chen felt very warm inside. Although it wasn\u2019t by any means a large amount of items, they all served a practical use for Jian Chen\u2019s needs. With this much, it truly showed how much Changyang Ba cared for his son.Stuffing the Space Ring back into his bosom, Jian Chen clearly remembered the words of his father. Until he was strong enough, he didn\u2019t dare to reveal his ring to anyone since it was such a precious item on the Tian Yuan continent. Although there weren\u2019t a small amount of people who had a Space Ring, they were all strong members of influential and wealthy clans and could easily protect themselves from danger.Climbing onto the bed, Jian Chen took a few monster cores from within the Space Ring and closed his eyes as he started to cultivate using the energy from within the monster cores.As usual, Jian Chen started to absorb the energy within the monster core at a frightening rate. If anyone were to see him now, then they would see the monster core emit a weak amount of light as the energy within started to flow into him like a thick stream. To the naked eye, the energy was surrounding Jian Chen\u2019s body while the monster core was rapidly shrinking in Jian Chen\u2019s hands.Ever since Jian Chen had broken through to become a Saint, there was an unfathomable mystery in his dantian in the form of an\u00a0azure and violet\u00a0glow. Because of that, his path of cultivation had become much more difficult than before, and although his absorption rate of the World Essence was several times faster than before, he could only absorb a pathetic 1% of it all, the rest of it was being taken by his dantian. So for now he would have to absorb the energy from the monster cores, but if he kept this up, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the consumption rate.After 2 hours, Jian Chen had already absorbed a lot of the energy within the monster cores, but Jian Chen continued to take monster core after monster core out of his Space Ring and continued to cultivate. He still had plenty of Class 1 Monster cores and a few Class 2 Monster Cores which would last him a couple of days at the very least. Fortunately, his father had also gave him 10 Class 3 Monster Cores and a single Class 4 Monster Core.On the second day, the sun had already reached a high point in the sky before Jian Chen finally finished cultivating. By this point, all of his Class 1 Monster Cores were essentially gone.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d After realizing the dwindling amount of monster cores in his Space Belt, Jian Chen gave a long sigh of hopelessness. The two glows within his dantian had really made him feel quite distressed.Calming himself, Jian Chen departed from both his room and the restaurant to mingle with the crowded streets.The morning sky was quite clear, and the fiery sun had not yet started to increase the temperature of the weather by a large amount. With a warm ray of light, everyone felt quite comfortable instead. On the busy streets, a few mercenaries were hurrying along while a few peddlers were slowly cruising along.Jian Chen eventually arrived at the Mercenary Union. He had already put in some thought about which job he wanted to take, so he would first need to become a mercenary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And right next to the Mercenary Union would always be a few small banks.White Cloud City was only a Second Class City, but it covered a large area of land. Jian Chen had walked for an entire 30 minutes before finally arriving at a bustling street at the center of the city. Right in front of him was a 20 meter tall building that towered over the other buildings; this was the Mercenary Union.The Mercenary Union\u2019s building was rather large and was constructed to resemble a giant magical beast. At the entrance of the building, a constant flow of all sorts of mercenaries went in and out.Jian Chen entered the Mercenary Union, and although this was the first time he had been to a place like this. However, since he had wanted to become an experienced mercenary. he had read up on about stuff like this in the academy library.The Mercenary Union had many people inside, and the business window had a long queuing line. All of the sales windows were filled with people trying to hand in their missions. Yet in the deepest part of the building, there was a mercenary enrollment window with a cold and desolate ambience.Jian Chen walked up to that window and said, \u201cHello, I would like to enlist as a mercenary.\u201dThe person in charge of this window was an old man who looked to be around 60 years old. Although he was old, his entire face was red and his eyes shined brightly with emotion.The elderly man indifferently looked at Jian Chen and flatly said, \u201cTo become a mercenary, one first must be a Saint. Have you reached that level yet?\u201d\u201cI have already reached the Saint level.\u201d Jian Chen answered.The elder sized Jian Chen up before handing over a piece of paper and asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cJian Chen!\u201d Jian Chen obviously didn\u2019t want to use the name Changyang Xiang Tian when he was trying to hide himself, so he instead used his original name from his previous life as his new moniker.\u201cHow old are you this year?\u201d The man asked.Hearing this, Jian Chen gave the question some thought, \u201c20 years old.\u201d Jian Chen couldn\u2019t possibly state his true age since a Saint at the age of 15 was a very rare sight in the Tian Yuan continent. If he had stated his true age it might have brought forth trouble later that he did not need. Although many people knew how talented Jian Chen was in Kargath Academy, only a few people like the headmaster and the vice headmaster knew his true age.A 20 year old was the normal age for one to be a Saint, and since his physical growth had long since outstripped the others, no one would think otherwise if he said he was 20. With his current appearance, there was almost no difference between a regular 20 year old and himself.\u201cWhat degree of strength have you reached?\u201d The man began to write on the piece of paper with a pen.\u201cPrimary Saint.\u201d Jian Chen said.The rest of the process to become a mercenary was rather simple. After paying the tax of one Silver Coin, Jian Chen had officially become a mercenary. He took his mercenary badge, which was that of the lowest rank since he was only a Primary Saint.After collecting his badge, Jian Chen didn\u2019t bother to stay behind at the Mercenary Union, he instead quickly left the building, and asked for directions to a medicine shop.Although the Tian Yuan continent had Radiant Saint Masters who could heal a wide variety of injuries, their numbers were incredibly small. Because of this, the status of any single Radiant Saint Master was very high, especially for mercenaries, who would be hard pressed to be able to invite a Radiant Saint Master into their group. Only the biggest and strongest groups could successfully invite one; those who were alone or weren\u2019t strong enough would find it impossible to enjoy the benefits a Radiant Saint Master would bring unless they paid extensive amounts of money.With an uncountable amount of mercenaries on the Tian Yuan continent, there were also an equally uncountable amount of injured people every day. Since the supply of Radiant Saint Masters did not meet the demand of those who needed them, a new method of using drugs and herbs was created to combat injuries. Using these medicines was vastly inferior to the healing capabilities of a Radiant Saint Master, but it was widely accepted by mercenaries. This was because aside from the high grade drugs, the normal medicines were very cheap.The medicine store wasn\u2019t small and was crowded inside. It was not at all like the Mercenary Union which had soundproofed walls all around. While in the Mercenary Union, all of the mercenaries there would loudly shout amongst each other to be heard, in the medicine store, people could easily converse with each other.The medicine store had many long lines of people. After sweeping a glance around the shop, Jian Chen finally found a line with relatively few people and waited.\u201cMight I ask what you want to order?\u201dFinally it was Jian Chen\u2019s turn. He was enthusiastically greeted by the person behind the counter.\u201cI\u2019ll need a few herbs, do you have them in stock?\u201d Jian Chen asked.The assistant looked at Jian Chen with an odd stare. This was the first time he had seen a person not come in to buy medicine for their wounds; instead, this person was buying herbs. Despite the curiosity he had towards Jian Chen, the assistant replied, \u201cOf course we sell them. I don\u2019t know what the honored customer wants, but whatever is in the store is for sale.\u201d\u201cI need some Qilin Grass, Rubbing Grass, Sweet Grass, Skeleton Grass, Sawtooth Grass, Antelope Flower, Root Flower, Lilies and Turtle Tubers\u2026do you have these?\u201d Jian Chen named almost 10 different types of herbs.The assistant immediately nodded, \u201cWe do, these herbs are very common and are not pricy at all. We have them all, but I don\u2019t know how much the honored customer wants?\u201dJian Chen had a happy smile on his face. He took out a gold coin and placed it onto the counter as he said, \u201cGive me a few of every item!\u201d These herbs were all extremely common goods; a single gold coin was enough to buy a cartful of them.Seeing the gold coin on the counter, the man smiled brightly, \u201cOkay, please wait for one moment, honored guest. I\u2019ll bring them to you in a moment!\u201d With that said, he entered the backroom to gather the materials.After paying for the herbs he needed, Jian Chen left the store and headed outside of the city. He arrived 10 miles outside of the city walls, and entered into the small forest. There, he dug a few mounds of earth and plucked some tree leaves. He then stored them within his Space Belt and walked back to White Cloud City.After returning to White Cloud City, Jian Chen purchased a new set of ordinary clothes and ducked into an uninhabited alleyway that was hidden by the general populace. After looking left and right to check if the coast was clear, he took out a small bunch of each herb he had bought earlier.He first grinded the herbs up into a fine powder using his hands and feet, before mixing it with the water he collected. Adding to the mixture some of the soft mud and leaves, he grinded it into powder as well. He continued to mix it before squeezing out some of the residual juice. Jian Chen took the result of this juice and immediately smeared it onto his face.Quickly, Jian Chen lifted his head; the complete transformation of his face could clearly be seen. At this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s looked entirely differed. Even a person who was familiar with his appearance wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him now. For all intents and purposes, Jian Chen was now a completely different person; his previously handsome looks had become average, and even his eyebrows and eyelashes had been altered to become shorter. The only features that hadn\u2019t changed were his pair of alluring eyes and his weak-looking figure.Jian Chen didn\u2019t stop there, the silver Light Wind Sword appeared in his hands. He suddenly placed the sword on the back of his waist as his waist-length hair blowing slightly into the air.With a silver flash of light, the Light Wind Sword quickly cut through his long hair with a speed that was almost hard to see with the naked eye. His hair was now at his shoulders. He changed into a new set of clothes from his previously luxurious set of clothes made from handspun silk; it was quite the change going from the finest silk to coarse leather.By this point, there was nothing about Jian Chen that would remind even those who knew him best of the original Jian Chen.Jian Chen took another few moments to ensure he hadn\u2019t overlooked anything to perfect his new appearance. Satisfied, he immediately burned his old clothes in a fire and exited the alley.Once again entering the Mercenary Union, Jian Chen walked towards the mission place. The mission hall in the Mercenary Union split its missions into 5 grades: S, A, B, C, and D. The highest grade was S, and the lowest was D. At the same time, the mercenaries were also split into these same 5 categories. At the moment, Jian Chen was only a D ranked mercenary, and so he could only take on D ranked missions.A mercenary\u2019s rank was determined by the amount of missions accomplished, their honor and strength. A D ranked mercenaries had to be at least Saints, while C ranked mercenaries had the power of Great Saints at the very minimum. With this system, S ranked mercenaries had to reach the strength and honor of Earth Saint Masters.Even if one had the same strength as an Earth Saint Master, if they didn\u2019t have the same amount of reputation, then they wouldn\u2019t be considered an S ranked mercenary. Therefore, this mercenary grading system had no shortcuts.D ranked missions were bountiful, but the majority of them were very boring. The majority of them were about finding lost items, or to help a store buy and deliver their items to another store. None of the missions were of any interest to Jian Chen.Right now, Jian Chen only wanted a mission that would let him leave the Gesun Kingdom because he knew the Hua Yun Sect was a major power in the kingdom. Although he had completely changed his looks, there was no guarantee that a person wouldn\u2019t discover his real identity and set off the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s pursuit to capture him. Just in case he accidentally revealed himself to the Hua Yun Sect by mistake, it would be best for him to leave the Gesun Kingdom to a place where the Hua Yun Sect had no power.Unfortunately, very few D ranked missions allowed a mercenary to travel in between countries. Most missions like that were for the higher ranked mercenaries and were usually never distributed to a D ranker. So when Jian Chen had looked at the entire mission list for D ranking mercenaries, he didn\u2019t see a single mission that would take him outside the country.Inwardly sighing, Jian Chen left the Mercenary Union. If he wanted to leave the Gesun Kingdom, he would need to rely on the cover of caravans. Otherwise, if he were to travel alone, he would be assaulted by a group of robbers that even he would most likely have trouble with. But even if he didn\u2019t meet any robbers, the border fortress was a place Jian Chen wouldn\u2019t be able to bypass with ease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With such a wide variety of goods being displayed, there was an equal variety of armed forces guarding it as people traded. With their presence, no one feared having their wares stolen.But when Jian Chen arrived, there were already people busily trading while others were streaming in and out of the area. All sorts of magical beasts were being ridden by the guards, though some of them were just regular horses.Horses were very common in the Tian Yuan continent, but while they were the most common type of transportation, they were also the most mundane.At that moment, a peddler walked by Jian Chen\u2019s side with an armload of goods. Holding out his hand, Jian Chen asked the peddler, \u201cFellow brother, might I ask if you know of any traders leaving the Gesun Kingdom?\u201dThe trader looked at Jian Chen with suspicion before pointing towards a big caravan. \u201cThat caravan is preparing to leave the Gesun Kingdom.\u201dJian Chen followed the youth\u2019s finger with his eye and saw 10 caravans grouped together. Surrounding the caravans was a large group of mercenaries protecting the items, while a middle aged man wearing a luxurious looking robe was commanding the people to load up the items onto the caravan.With only a single glance, Jian Chen knew that this middle aged man was the one responsible for the caravans. Immediately walking on over, he asked the man, \u201cUncle, might I ask if your caravans are leaving Gesun Kingdom?\u201dHearing Jian Chen, the middle aged man turned around to take a look at him, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201dLaughing, Jian Chen said, \u201cUncle, if your caravans are leaving Gesun Kingdom, might I join you? Although my strength is not all that strong, I am still a mercenary nonetheless. I don\u2019t need a reward for this either, how about it?\u201dThe middle aged man looked relieved at Jian Chen\u2019s last sentence and said, \u201cFine. However you must stick close to us during the trip. Also, any roadside fares must be paid by you and won\u2019t be compensated for by us. Lastly, if we are attacked, then you must help protect the group and fight together with us.\u201dOn the Tian Yuan continent, most of the weaker mercenaries would usually either form their own large group, or join a caravan group in order to travel from kingdom to kingdom.Since the roads connecting the kingdoms were long and dangerous, there was a very high chance of encountering highwaymen. Ambushes from magical beasts were also a common occurrence, and in some areas, those attacks happened frequently. Because of this, every caravan would welcome a mercenary\u2019s presence with wide arms, and generally wouldn\u2019t refuse anyone. After all, even one man could add to the overall strength, and could help protect someone\u2019s life.Jian Chen didn\u2019t hesitate at all to agree to the man\u2019s conditions.\u201cOur caravan will depart in an hour, so go make your preparations.\u201d With that said, the man didn\u2019t pay any more attention to Jian Chen and resumed commanding the transporters to work.Afterwards, Jian Chen headed towards the White Cloud City stables and spent 50 Gold Coins to buy a single horse. Leading the horse back, he patiently waited for the caravan to depart.An hour quickly passed as Jian Chen mounted his horse and followed the caravans from behind. The mercenaries that were originally hired to protect the caravan sent many inquisitive looks at him, but none bothered to talk to him. Since there were three caravan groups that combined into one, there were naturally three groups of mercenaries. Aside from those three groups, there were also many mercenaries going by themselves. It was because of the unknown dangers that the caravans had to group together both themselves and their mercenaries, resulting in a total of about 500 people. It was even normal for one to recognize a familiar face.Soon they left the city gates. Although the caravan representative had a few bodyguards and mercenaries, he didn\u2019t stay at the gates for long, and immediately ordered the caravans to move out once the negotiations were over.\u201cOne moment.\u201d At that moment before everyone could move, an armored man came down from the city towers with a scroll of paper.The middle aged man crossed the city gates and handed the scroll to one of the bodyguards. \u201cTake this portrait and stick it to the city gates. Then find the best portrait master and send him to me. I want him to duplicate this portrait and post it everywhere in the city. If anyone can find the person described on the portrait, capture him, and if there\u2019s any resistance, kill him.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d A soldier took the scroll and immediately tacked it to the city wall.\u201cThe picture on the portrait is a wanted criminal in the Gesun Kingdom. Take a good look now; look for this person in every single city you stop at. By all means, you must not let the criminal get away. Do you understand?\u201d The man repeated with a commanding tone that could be heard clearly even from far away.As the bodyguard posted the portrait onto the city gates, everyone glanced at the figure on it. The person looked to be no younger than 16 years old, and no older than 20. Although the person looked very young, his looks were handsome and actually looked very lifelike despite it being a drawing. Whoever had drawn this portrait was a true master of art.After posting the portrait, the man waved his arm at the caravan representative, \u201cThat\u2019ll be all, you can leave now.\u201dWith no further interruptions, the caravan began to move once more. However, the guards at the city gates had already went from ten in number to a hundred. Every single one of them would check each person as they entered or exited the gates, and then compared them to the person in the portrait.When Jian Chen was about to exit the gates, he saw the portrait on the gates, and his eyes hardened. The person on the portrait was of his original appearance.Seeing this, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel some fear in his heart regarding the Hua Yun Sect. This city had been countless of miles aways from Lore City. He had only left Lore City yesterday and arrived at White Cloud City just last night. Yet not only did the Hua Yun Sect perfectly capture his appearance onto a portrait, but they had also been able to quickly send out the portraits to a city thousands of miles away. This type of efficiency make any person quake in fear, and Jian Chen doubted that the Hua Yun Sect had only sent out portraits to White Cloud City. Right now, he feared almost every single city within the Gesun Kingdom had warrants of his capture.Jian Chen secretly rejoiced at his decision to change his appearance; otherwise, he would have been hard pressed to escape White Cloud City.As Jian Chen rode his horse forward, the two soldiers at the gates scrutinized him with a heavy stare. However, Jian Chen had already changed his appearance; he was completely different from before. If people who had been familiar with him wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him, then how would some strangers be able to find out who he was?With no more hindrances, Jian Chen mixed in with the other mercenaries and departed from White Cloud City in a long line.The final destination for the three caravans was the neighboring country, Blue Wind Kingdom. But because the caravans had many precious goods in them, they were going at a slow pace. Although the border fort wasn\u2019t too far away, it would take them two or three days of walking to reach the border, and crossing into the Blue Wind Kingdom would require another half month.Jian Chen looked at the grand caravan; it wasn\u2019t using regular horses to pull, but rather four Class 1 Magical Beasts specially bred for this purpose. Surrounding the magical beasts were a few mercenaries riding on top of their own magical beasts; none of them looked weak at all. The man Jian Chen had talked to earlier was there as well. It seemed that all of them were protecting the caravan as well.Jian Chen had quietly figured out that within the middle caravan was the boss, if not an important person. This was because this was a luxurious caravan, and still had two other caravans by its side.It took around four days for the group of caravans to reach the border fort, which was a long wall that spanned for countless of miles. It was 50 meters tall and 20 meters thick. From afar, this great wall looked like a long dragon that made people shake in awe.Jian Chen looked at the wall in front of him as the shade covered him. Under the protection of the wall, the setting sun was completely blocked, and the the area in front of the wall was completely covered in darkness.. This sight was enough to make people who had never seen this sight before shake in awe, as they felt like the wall was some frightening and profound force.This was the first time Jian Chen had ever seen the Gesun Kingdom\u2019s wall. There was awe in Jian Chen\u2019s mind as he looked. In his previous world, he had seen many walls, but none of them could compare to this. The biggest wall he had seen was 20 meters tall, but this wall in front of him was 50 meters tall; it was like comparing an adult to a child.\u201cWhat a great wall, I can\u2019t even imagine how long it took for them to build a wall of this size.\u201d Jian Chen sighed in admiration.Hearing what he said, the mercenary riding right next to Jian Chen stifled his laughter, \u201cA wall of this size is normal in the Tian Yuan continent. Practically every kingdom has a wall of this caliber.\u201d The mercenary looked at Jian Chen and said, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been to any of the Three Great Empires, then let me tell you: Each one of the walls have a height of at least 100 meters and a thickness of 50 meters. These small city walls can\u2019t even compare!\u201dJian Chen turned around to look at the mercenary who spoke to him. He looked to be around 20 years old and had a suntanned face. With his coarse leather clothes, the man looked to be quite ordinary.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019ll definitely go check out the Three\u00a0Great Empires.\u201d Jian Chen laughed.\u201cThe roads connecting the Three Great Empires are quite long and dangerous. At the same time, magical beasts run rampant there, so it\u2019s not that easy to travel in between the empires.\u201d The mercenary said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Chaotic Sword GodCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter\u00a071: Mu YunJian Chen let loose a gentle smile as he cupped his hands in greeting, \u201cIt seems brother has seen many suns while traveling the Tian Yuan Continent.\u201dThe mercenary returned his smile, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t all that long, just a few years, that\u2019s all. Compared to those that have left their homes to travel for ten to a hundred years, I am still green.\u201d\u201cThis brother here doesn\u2019t know what to call you.\u201d Jian Chen said.\u201cMy name is Mu Yun, what\u2019s your name?\u201d The mercenary spoke with great enthusiasm.\u201cI\u2019m called Jian Chen.\u201d Jian Chen replied, he had already decided to use the name \u201cJian Chen\u201d in the future on the Tian Yuan Continent.Following this, Jian Chen and Mu Yun started to converse, discussing several interesting issues on Tian Yuan Continent.Although this was the first time Jian Chen was traveling the Tian Yuan Continent, he had read plenty of books regarding the continent back in the Kargath Library and had grown familiar with a few things including history. Mu Yun, on the other hand, had traversed the Tian Yuan Continent for a few years, so his experience could be said to be quite ample. The two had actually complimented each other nicely and so as they enthusiastically talked to each other, they unconsciously formed a close bond with each other.As the caravan got closer to the gates of the border fort, Jian Chen noticed a portrait tacked to the side of one of the gates. On the portrait, the name \u201cChangyang Xiang Tian\u201d was inscribed on it with a generous reward printed below it.If people had any hints or clues to Changyang Xiang Tian\u2019s whereabouts that proved to be true, then they would be awarded with 1000 Purple Coins. If their information led to the capture of the person, then they would be rewarded with another 4000 Purple Coins.A Gold Coin was enough to feed a small household of three for over a month, and a Purple Coin was the equivalent to a hundred Gold Coins. So a thousand Purple Coins was a generous sum of money to any mercenary. With such a tidy sum, any mercenary, or anyone for that matter, would be able to buy a nice home and spend the rest of their lives without any more financial worries. It was easy to say that this reward was so irresistible that no one could turn it down.The best reward people could hope for from traveling would be to capture Changyang Xiang Tian. If they could capture and hand him to the Hua Yun Sect, then they would be able to enjoy a prize of ten thousand Purple Coins.Seeing the generous prize for his capture, Jian Chen\u2019s normally emotionless eyes flashed with a cold glare.\u201cHua Yun Sect, you really do think highly of me to offer so great a reward and label me as a wanted criminal throughout the Gesun Kingdom. To think that you\u2019re even using the Mercenary Union to try to find me.\u201d Jian Chen inwardly sneered, however, he felt a small pang of hopelessness. On the Tian Yuan Continent, strength determined everything, and his own strength was currently insufficient. Because of the Hua Yun Sect, he had to forsake his name, his image, his home and his kingdom. In regards with such a predicament, not only was he unable to do anything, but even one of the four major clans in Lore City, his Changyang Clan, was powerless to stop the Hua Yun Sect.\u201cAi!\u201d Jian Chen sighed. At that moment, he could not help but recall the image of his mother\u2019s sorrowfully crying face when he left.After thinking back to that, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes softened momentarily before rapidly becoming firm. After that moment, he had promised himself that he would dedicate himself to cultivation and improving his strength. Otherwise, under the great power of the Hua Yun Sect, he would never be able to return to the Gesun Kingdom and see his mother again. More importantly, he would never be able to feel motherly love ever again.The previous Jian Chen was an orphan and had never known what maternal love was. The heavens had not only granted him a new shot at life, but also a blessed family life. Jian Chen had treasured the feelings he felt from his relationship with his mother.Even those who were born into a happy family wouldn\u2019t be able to experience what Jian Chen had felt. As someone who lived an entire life in isolation, he had always desired family. But because he had always been in solitude, his heart had only known what it felt like to be alone.Next to the empty gates, roughly 200 soldiers stood by and stared down every single person that entered and exited the city. Whenever someone had an unclear face, they would be stopped by the soldiers and be compared with the portrait before finally being allowed to continue.Although the soldiers had blocked many strong mercenaries, none were in a hurry. This was because outside of Gesun Kingdom\u2019s boundary, the fort had over ten thousand soldiers and didn\u2019t lack in experts at all. So if a battle broke out, it would be obvious who would be the loser.The doors to the fort were gigantic; even if five caravans were to enter side by side, they would not block the road at all. As Jian Chen and his caravans slowly walked forward, another smaller caravan sped up from behind. As they saw the gates of the fort approach, they started to speak.\u201cWho exactly is this guy in the portrait and how is it that he\u2019s being chased by everyone? I didn\u2019t think that even Gesun Kingdom\u2019s border forts would have this portrait tacked up as well.\u201d\u201cIt looks like this guy broke countless laws; I\u2019ve already been to three cities and saw this portrait posted everywhere. Even the Mercenary Union has put out a warrant for his arrest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, this guy is definitely someone who broke a few major laws, or annoyed someone of great influence. Right now, the Mercenary Union has already given him an A ranked bounty with no restriction to the rank required to take it. So even a D ranked mercenary could cash in on this bounty.\u201d\u201cExactly, the commission for this is extremely high; as long as we have information on his location, that\u2019s already 1000 Purple Coins. And if they capture him with this information, then that\u2019s another 4000 Purple Coins.\u201d\u201cA few thousand is nothing; if we personally capture and bring him to the Hua Yun Sect, that\u2019s ten thousand Purple Coins. Ten thousand coins, the thought is terrifying. I wouldn\u2019t be able to spend ten thousand Purple Coins in a single lifetime!\u201d\u2026\u2026.Hearing the merchants talk about the portrait, Mu Yun turned to Jian Chen and laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t know what type of crime this Changyang Xiang Tian committed in order to have the Hua Yun Sect spend so much money to go after him, but it can\u2019t possibly be a justifiable sentence, since the portrait there says he is only at the level of a Primary Saint. How strange, how could a Primary Saint garner so much hate from the Hua Yun Sect? Could it be that this Changyang Xiang Tian got caught peeking at the Hua Yun Sect\u2019s daughter while she took a bath?\u201dHearing Mu Yun talk, Jian Chen could only laugh. He helplessly looked at Mu Yuan, \u201cBrother Mu Yun, I have lived in the Gesun Kingdom for over a dozen years and more, and heard much about the Hua Yun Sect. However, I have only heard about the sect leader having a son, not a daughter. So sneakily watching his daughter take a bath doesn\u2019t seem to be possible.\u201dMu Yun threw a dirty look at Jian Chen, \u201cWhat do you know, who says the Hua Yun Sect leader has no daughter? This can\u2019t possibly be confirmed, maybe she\u2019s hidden from the rest of the world.\u201dJian Chen helplessly shook his head, deciding in his heart to no longer argue with Mu Yun about whether the Hua Yun Sect leader really had a daughter or not.The caravan didn\u2019t run into any obstructions at the fort, and Jian Chen\u2019s appearance easily passed through without trouble. No one could tell his looks were fake since Jian Chen was an expert of disguise; so even though he had only used a few common herbs, his disguise was flawless.Moreover, this disguise technique was something that was passed down to Jian Chen as he wandered about in his previous world. It looked simple, but was actually quite profound, and couldn\u2019t be learnt easily. In this world, this type of method was not yet invented, so it was natural no one would think twice about it. As long as his face didn\u2019t tear up, then no one would be able to find out.After passing through the border fort, they were greeted with plains that stretched farther than the eye could see. There were very few people, and the road only had a few caravans on it. This was the road that was not under any control from the kingdoms, and was just a unregulated chaotic piece of land. Robbers and bandits roamed around these parts, so caravans generally grouped together with others and hired strong mercenaries to protect them.This stretch of land was very large as well; a single day of traveling only got them a quarter of the way there. If they wanted to reach the Blue Wind Kingdom, they would also have to pass through a mountain range to get to the border fort. With the speed the caravans were going, if they wanted to reach the fort, they would need at least ten days. Even if the road was flat, they wouldn\u2019t be able to go any faster, since the caravans were burdened with large carts of goods.As the day grew dark, the caravan stopped to set up for the night. The mercenaries set up camp around the caravans, while the caravan drivers unloaded fodder for the horses to eat.A plume of smoke billowed up from the camps as a few of the mercenaries sat down to roast some magical beast meat or some pre-made food for them to eat. However, not all of them sat together; a few of the mercenaries stood off by the side and began to eat their own rations.Jian Chen took out a tent from his Space Belt and then looked for a dry and flat piece of land to set it up. Since he wasn\u2019t a part of any mercenary group, he was not able to use the provisions provided for those that were hired. Jian Chen had to take responsibility for anything he used without any assistance from the caravans.Right as Jian Chen finished pitching his tent, Mu Yun suddenly walked up to Jian Chen and said, \u201cJian Chen, it seems like you only joined this caravan halfway through. Where do you plan to go?\u201dJian Chen nodded and said: \u201cI want to go to the Blue Wind Kingdom. What about you, brother Mu Yun?\u201dMu Yun laughed and said, \u201cI wish to go the Cage Kingdom, which means I\u2019ll have to pass through the Blue Wind Kingdom.\u201d As he spoke, his hand also withdrew a tent from his Space Belt and he began to set it up not too far away from Jian Chen\u2019s tent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a Class 1 Monster Core in hand, he started to cultivate. Now that he was traveling the Tian Yuan continent, there would be dangers lurking around every corner. This meant that he had to be strong in order to stay safe. Thus, Jian Chen didn\u2019t dare to squander even a second in order to increase his strength. Not only that, but he knew that if he grew stronger, then he would be able to to return to the Gesun Kingdom and reunite with his family without fear of the Hua Yun Sect. Otherwise, if he dared to show his face there, he would be chased to the ends of the earth by the sect.Right now the outside was relatively peaceful. There was only the occasional sound of footsteps being heard as a few of the mercenaries patrolled around the campsite.The time quietly passed as it became late. At that moment, all of the mercenaries in their tents were sound asleep, and the mercenaries that were patrolling were drowsy to the point of being in an unfocused state.Just then, a dark blade flashed. It traveled under the cover of the night and silently slashed the neck of one of the patrolling mercenaries. This dark flash was clearly the result of an assassin\u2019s power, and with a soundless gurgle, the mercenary fell to the ground dead.The dark flash had moved through the air silently and quickly. No one could sense this blade coming. Since the campgrounds were wide, and the target had been a lone mercenary standing in a remote place, there was no way anyone could possibly notice his death before he fell to the ground.Right as the first mercenary fell to the ground, countless dark flashes flew out towards the camp and killed all of the mercenaries patrolling a bit far from camp.Jian Chen wasn\u2019t too far away from the campsite, and so when the mercenaries fell to the ground, there was one that fell only 30 meters away from Jian Chen. The crossed legged Jian Chen\u2019s ear shook from the sound he heard as his eyes abruptly flew open. Looking around, Jian Chen bent forward to open the tent flap just a crack to see what was happening outside.Just as Jian Chen opened up the flap to his tent to check up on what was happening outside, another flash of light could be seen as it shot through a patrolling mercenary. Like the others, this man also fell to the ground without a sound.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes widened in surprise at this sight. It was clear to him that the caravan was under attack, but with his previous experience, he did not panic. Roaring loudly from his tent, he yelled, \u201cEveryone be careful, we are under attack!\u201dJian Chen let loose a loud roar that could be heard clearly throughout the campsite. With his warning, the previously peacefully quiet campsite erupted into noise as countless mercenaries came bursting out from their tents. In just a short moment, hundreds of mercenaries making a racket had appeared in the previously undisturbed camp.Jian Chen\u2019s words were common to all those that had traveled throughout the Tian Yuan continent. Those who lived by their weapons were extremely sensitive to sound, and so when they heard Jian Chen, they immediately came charging out of their tents. However, as everyone came rushing from their tents, they looked around themselves and could only see their own mercenaries without any signs of an enemy.\u201cAn enemy? Where\u2019s the enemy\u2026\u201d\u201cWho was the one that yelled, I don\u2019t see anyone\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the enemy, who\u2019s the motherf*cker that cried wolf\u2026\u201dMany of the mercenaries began to cry out loud in anger. If they found the guy who cried wolf, then he wouldn\u2019t be let off easily.\u201cNot good, Captain Lang Tian, the sentry Du Mu Lan has died!\u201dJust as many of the mercenaries were cursing out loud, another yell came crying loudly over the others, causing many to turn their heads.Hearing that, every single mercenary turned towards the cry in dead silence. At the same time, another three flashes of light came flying through towards the group, and slammed straight into three mercenaries\u2019 chests.The three mercenaries that were hit didn\u2019t even have the opportunity to even cry out before they slumped to the ground. But before they could even hit the floor, another three streaks of lights flew out and claimed the lives of another three mercenaries.The streaks of black light never ceased to fly out towards the mercenaries. Under the guise of the night, it was hard for the people to figure out where they were coming from or where they were aimed at.Since the light was shooting at a fast pace, a dozen mercenaries had already succumbed to the attack before anyone could even react. At this time, a mercenary finally cried out in terror, \u201cBe careful, enemies are atta-\u2026\u201d But before he could finish his sentence, a streak of light flew towards him and killed him.\u201cEveryone scatter and take cover!\u201d Another mercenary yelled. It was a large middle aged man with a scar on his face. Two red hammers materialized in his hands as he charged towards the direction of where the attack came from.\u201cCaptain Lang Tian, be careful\u2026\u2019Watching the man charge towards the direction of the enemy, many of the mercenaries cried out in concern.As the man charged ahead, a few dozen of the stronger mercenaries began to follow his lead, and started to rush towards the source of the attacks.But the streaks of light continued to fly out; this time they had changed targets and began to hit those mercenaries that were starting to come towards them.Although this was a hasty charge without knowing all the information, these dozen mercenaries were not weak. The still charging Captain Lang Tian swung out with his twin red hammers and lit up the area around them like a striking lantern.As he saw two flashes of light head towards him, Lang Tian sneered and swung out his hammers, smashing them away from him.As the two hit each other, Lang Tian\u2019s hammers completely smashed through the rays of light. Silently, the light disappeared; although they were strong enough to take another person\u2019s life, they weren\u2019t strong enough to withstand an actual attack.The mercenaries behind Lang Tian weren\u2019t weak either, and without fear, their Saint Weapons began to form and destroy the black lights that were aimed at them.At that time, another situation had occurred; an ear piercing whistle broke the silence. As the mercenaries turned their heads towards the sound, they could only see a large concentration of arrows flying at them, like a swarm of locusts.Seeing the amount of arrows, a few dozen of the mercenaries immediately stopped their charge and took cover.\u201cDing ding ding ding\u2026\u201dThe arrows immediately landed against their Saint Weapons, creating a cacophony of sound.Lang Tian and a few other mercenaries didn\u2019t bother to stop their charge. Faced with the storm of arrows, many of the mercenaries only snarled loudly and used their Saint Force to completely enwrap themselves. Although the layer was very thin, its defensive power was extremely strong. These arrows were shrugged off as they fell to the ground, completely unable to pierce through the protective layering.\u201cFellow brothers, let\u2019s kill!\u201dJust as the mercenaries were about to follow the initial charge into the enemy grounds, a clear voice shouted out from the darkness of the night. The cry shook the heavens, and with it came a faint, dark shadow rushing towards the mercenaries.\u201cThe bandits have come out, ready your arrows!\u201dWithin the mercenary camp, a mercenary cried out to warn them as many of them started to notch their bows. Aiming at the blurs, they waited for the right distance before they fired.Jian Chen stood on the outskirts of the battle, his eyes hardening as he looked at the incoming shadows. Although they were still relatively far from the campsite and the night had rendered visibility to almost zero, Jian Chen could count out a few hundred shadows. This number wasn\u2019t any lower than the mercenaries\u2019 own number. Moreover, with the recent storm of arrows, a few of the mercenaries had been killed, further decreasing their numbers.\u201cFire!\u201dBy this point, the bandits had already entered firing range. With the command of one person, the hundred arrows were released into the air by the mercenaries and flew towards the bandits with an ear piercing whistle.Amongst the bandits were a few strong ones, but the majority of them were fairly weak and so a few dozen of them fell victim to the storm of arrows.Three more streaks of light came flying out silently from behind the bandits and took the lives of three of the mercenary archers. Those three streaks of light left small finger sized holes in them as they fell to the ground.The frequency of the streaks of light was high and always came in groups of three. In a short while, a total of nine archers fell dead.Seeing the wounds on the mercenaries\u2019 corpses, a middle aged man called out, \u201cEveryone be careful, there\u2019s a dark attribute Saint amongst the bandits.\u201dAs he spoke, another three rays of light came flying out towards the man that had just spoke.The middle aged man was by no means weak. His face hardened as a shiny axe appeared in his right hand, which he then used to chop the streaks of black light.\u201cBang!\u201dThe streak of black light clashed with the middle aged man\u2019s axe, causing a giant explosion of sound before they disappeared.The man shook slightly as his face hardened. \u201cDamn it, the enemies have three dark attributed Saints who are specialized archers. In this area, only the Boundless Bandits have this type of power.\u201d\u201cVice Captain Liu, what are you saying, could it be these are the Boundless Bandits?\u201d\u201cGood heavens, these are the Boundless Bandits\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a disaster, to think we came across the Boundless Bandits\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wasn\u2019t very familiar with this bandit group. When he had read the books in both Changyang Mansion and Kargath Library, the only thing he was able to learn about the Boundless Bandits was that they were a very strong bandit group that had existed for 200 years already.The Boundless Bandits were a strong group from the very beginning. They wandered about the borders of several kingdoms and were any caravan\u2019s worst nightmare. The Boundless Bandits were ruthless and whenever they robbed merchants, they never left any survivors. Countless mercenaries died due to the Boundless Bandits, and the Boundless Bandits had occasionally attacked many villages and even some minor cities. In the past, two Class 3 cities had been plundered by them, and a Class 2 city had suffered tremendous damage from them. With every village they massacred, it further enhanced their reign of terror and caused merchants to fear traveling to faraway places. This in turn incurred great losses for some of the major kingdoms.At that time, the Four Great Kingdoms: the Gesun Kingdom, the Blue Moon Kingdom, the Blue Wind Kingdom, and the Var Kingdom had finally discovered the main hideout of the Boundless Bandits, and sent their soldiers to annihilate them. Unfortunately, the Boundless Bandits had power beyond what was anticipated, and although the Four Great Kingdoms had succeeded in the end, they had suffered disastrous casualties.After a few unsuccessful attempts, the Four Great Kingdoms each sent their strongest expert to fight the Boundless Bandits at their main base\u2013Boundless Mountain. Those four experts came to Boundless Mountain and fought so hard that the entire mountain shook and split open. The explosions of battle lasted for one day and one night before gradually stopping. Sometime during the battle, the six peaks of the mountain had caved in.When the experts from the Four Great Kingdom had returned, their faces were not a pretty sight. They didn\u2019t say anything and left quickly; soon after, the commander of the mission to annihilate the Boundless Bandits had immediately received an order from the king for all the troops to retreat from Boundless Mountain.Although no one had personally seen what the experts from the Four Great Kingdoms had done inside the mountain, even those without a brain could guess what events had transpired. This result was something the mercenaries and merchants had a hard time accepting, and so as a result, the Boundless Bandit\u2019s reputation skyrocketed. To some mercenaries and merchants, the Boundless Bandits had become a mythical figure that was feared by quite a few of the neighboring kingdoms.However, there was still one good thing; after the experts had fought them on Boundless Mountain, the Boundless Bandits\u2019 activities decreased drastically. Even though many merchants and mercenaries still died by their hand every year, it didn\u2019t happen as often as in the past. It only occurred once every two months and their methods weren\u2019t as violent as before. This gave the merchants plenty of opportunities. The only downside was that they couldn\u2019t predict the times when the Boundless Bandits would attack. Thus, even if some of the caravans wanted to travel at specific times in order to avoid the bandits, it was an impossible task.\u201cMotherf*cker, the Boundless Bandits aren\u2019t anything, this one will chop them down like grass.\u201d A mercenary cried out with hatred as he charged towards the Boundless Bandits without a trace of fear in his eyes.Aside from him, all the other mercenaries had looked at the incoming Boundless Bandits with looks of extreme hatred as well. The Boundless Bandits had killed numerous mercenaries and merchants, and even some of their family members and close friends had been murdered by these bandits. So in their hearts, the mercenaries\u2019 initial fears had been overtaken by their intense hatred.As travelers who depended on their strengths in order to survive as mercenaries, their murderous nature overtook their normally upright morality, and made them into men who feared nothing, not even death.\u201c10 years ago, my own father was killed by the hands of the Boundless Bandits. Today, I will take revenge for my father.\u201d A 20 year old mercenary glared at the incoming bandits with blood red eyes. Grief and rage had consumed him along with hatred.Another older man around the age of ** looked at them with fierce killing intent as he said through his teeth, \u201cThe Boundless Bandits killed my brother 5 years ago. Even if I sacrifice my life today, I\u2019ll take the life of at least one of them to serve as the funerary mat in revenge for my brother!\u201dThe black streaks of light continued to come at them without pause. Even now, a few of the mercenary archers were still falling prey to the strange ray of light. While a few of the mercenaries tried to take cover, the others continued to fire arrows at the incoming bandits.As the bandits got closer and closer, many of the mercenaries became more frantic. The amount of bandits rushing at them had a major influence on the mercenaries, and scared many of them into retreating. Their rebellious spirit was gone, since not everyone was willing to fight back \u2014 there were some that were more cowardly in the mercenary ranks.Seeing how the mercenaries were slowly losing control of the situation, a middle aged man began to worry and shouted, \u201cDo not panic! These are only a small portion of the Boundless Bandits, they\u2019re no stronger than us. As long as we work together, we can defeat them. Otherwise, we will all die together. Brothers, for our lives, we must come together!\u201dHearing the middle aged man, even the most cowardly mercenaries had felt some courage return to their hearts. If they wanted to survive, they would need to fight. Their fierce desire to survive forced them to abandon their cowardly nature, and they were now prepared to risk their lives.The mercenaries tried to think of any possible ways to dodge the dark streaks of light while continuing to shoot at the bandits. After a good hundred bandits were killed, the Boundless Bandits finally arrived in front of the mercenaries. By this point, each mercenary had already fired their last arrow, and so they dropped their bows and summoned their Saint Weapons to engage the Boundless Bandits in close combat.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dThe two sides began to roar, their cries piercing the heavens as their weapons collided against each other. But the mercenaries were still not able to see behind the bandits, and the streaks of black lights were still able to precisely strike at each mercenary without fail. Within a few moments, a dozen mercenaries had fallen.\u201cThe captain is being stalled by the bandit experts. Charles, Ge Sen Er and Mel, you three follow me. We\u2019ll definitely find the hiding spots of the archers.\u201d An armored mercenary cried out over the chaos of the moment. Straight after saying that, he leapt over the body of a bandit and charged towards the source of the black streaks.As the armored mercenary charged, the three other mercenaries mentioned leapt to follow him. Using the heads of the bandits to block the streaks of black light, they continued onwards.The four mercenaries leapt over the fallen bandits; the other bandits standing had no chance against them. Although the Boundless Bandits were strong enough as a whole to rival kingdoms, this small portion wasn\u2019t enough. Moreover, their elite members were already blocked by a few experts during the initial charge, so there weren\u2019t any strong bandits remaining to block the four mercenaries.Another three streaks of light came flying out at the four mercenaries. Clearly, the hidden dark attributed archers had figured out the intentions of the mercenaries.Straight after the first three streaks were shot, another three black streaks came flying straight behind, making it a total of six streaks that silently approached the four mercenaries.The four mercenaries weren\u2019t weak and were actually far stronger than the mercenaries on patrol. Each one of them summoned their Saint Weapons and smashed against the streaks of light with them. When the two collided, the black lights directly dissipated. The mercenaries\u2019 paces didn\u2019t falter in the slightest as they continued to charge towards the bandit archers. All four of them knew that if they didn\u2019t resolve the issues with the archers, then their mercenary group would continue to take on heavy losses.Although the three mercenary groups had several hundred people, their strengths in the mercenary world were all lower ranked ones. The mercenaries were generally at the level of a Saint. Those who were a Great Saint were very few. There were only a few Great Saint Masters in this group: the three Mercenary Captains and the vice captain. However, the four of them were currently engaged in battle with the experts on the bandit side, and did not have time to find the archers.The moment the four mercenaries escaped from view, the streaks of black light stopped as well. Whether or not they had taken care of the archers, they at the very least had gained some precious time for the mercenaries. After all, the black streaks of light were detrimental to the mercenaries, since they couldn\u2019t be easily seen under the night. Their travel speeds were also extremely fast, and so the weaker mercenaries would have no way of spotting the lights.With the hidden danger gone, the mercenaries no longer had to protect themselves from any long ranged attacks. They could now fight against the bandits with 100% of their power and tear them apart.By this point, every single mercenary threw away all fear they had for the Boundless Bandits. For the sake of surviving, all of them were using their utmost efforts to kill the bandits, only hoping to end up victorious.The battle rose to an ear deafening point as Saint Weapons clashed against each other and blood splashed everywhere throughout the battlefield. As the war went on, dozens of people from both sides fell victim to the other side.Jian Chen had also entered the battle, despite using only his Saint power. However, his formidable fighting strength was definitely enough to shock anyone. They could only see Jian Chen\u2019s use his Profound Steps to evade the attacks coming from every direction. In his hand, he had only a silver sword that was 1.3 meters long and 2 fingers wide. It constantly flashed in his hand at lightning fast speeds. His pierces were so fast that only a thin ribbon of silver light would flicker across as he moved; there was no way the naked eye could catch a glimpse of the sword\u2019s material form.Jian Chen\u2019s sword was not only fast but it was also one that nobody could defend against. Moreover, his swordplay was extremely precise. Every time his sword pierced outwards, he could accurately stab the enemy in the throat, killing the enemy in one attack. There were very few people at the same level of strength as him that could evade Jian Chen\u2019s lightning-fast sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The battlefield around him was filled with desolate screams, and blood splashed everywhere. To Jian Chen, this was already a common sight, so it didn\u2019t disturbed him in the slightest.Jian Chen continued to stab out with his sword, after every attack another Boundless Bandit would fall. With his lightning fast speed, enemies of equal strength weren\u2019t able to keep up with Jian Chen\u2019s flow for more than three moves, and even more of them were instantly killed with only a single blow to the throat.In terms of strength, Jian Chen was lower ranked when compared to the bandits. However, when it came to killing bandits, no one could compare to Jian Chen. In the span of a few minutes, over a few dozen bandits had been killed by him, drenching his Light Wind Sword with blood. Jian Chen\u2019s clothes on the other hand, still maintained their pure, cottony, white and brown, as not a single splash of blood landed on them.Unknowingly, Jian Chen had penetrated into the core of the bandits. Boundless Bandits surrounded him for 20 meters in every direction with no fellow mercenary in sight. The closest few were fighting in small groups of three to five on the outskirts of the bandit\u2019s vanguard.\u201cKill!\u201d Three of the Boundless Bandits cried as they charged at Jian Chen with a bloodthirsty roar. With a lift of their Saint Weapons, they slashed down in hopes of chopping Jian Chen in half.Jian Chen immediately flew forward like a speed demon towards one of the incoming bandits. His Light Wind Sword flashed with a blood red color as it shot towards the bandit\u2019s throat.Jian Chen was an expert with the sword, when he made his move he did it fast, the bandit\u2019s had no time to react. He could only see the bloody flash come towards his neck, then the next thing he knew, he couldn\u2019t breathe. It was almost as if something was blocking his throat, so he couldn\u2019t yell either. Immediately, a trickle of blood came flowing from his neck as the bandit fell to the ground without making another sound.Even in his final moments, the bandit didn\u2019t realize that he was dying; perhaps he didn\u2019t even know his throat had been pierced by Jian Chen\u2019s sword. Because Jian Chen\u2019s swordplay was so fast, the bandit didn\u2019t have time to react. Moreover, the blade was so thin that he did not even feel pain from the stab.Even after the Light Wind Sword had pierced the bandit\u2019s throat, Jian Chen didn\u2019t stop moving. The other two bandits had already gotten close, readying their weapons to slash down towards him.Facing the two bandits who were preparing their weapons, Jian Chen did not look panicked at all. With a calm face, he grabbed his sword and used the Profound Steps to approach the two bandits at rapid speeds. At the same time, the blood red sword in his hand lashed out and stabbed one of the two bandits in the throat.The Light Wind Sword met no resistance as the stabbed bandit didn\u2019t react at all. It pierced deeply through his throat, and with a fluid motion, Jian Chen pulled it out and stabbed the third bandit as well.Every single stab from Jian Chen had been extremely fast, the naked eye wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up. No one would be able to avoid his strokes, and so the third bandit would definitely not be able to survive a blow to his throat either.To Jian Chen, killing people was already as common as breathing. Seeing the life escaping from people was nothing uncommon, and he never hesitated over taking a bandit\u2019s life. And so the Light Wind Sword continued to fly out towards the bandits.Amongst the fierce clash, no one was safe from this battle. Even the caravan drivers who weren\u2019t Saints were grouped together with a few mercenaries fending off the bandits.The battle was causing both sides to rapidly lose numbers; both the bandits and the mercenaries suffered from disastrous casualties. Aside from Jian Chen, who was still completely clean of blood, everyone else was drenched in it; some were covered head to toe in both blood and wounds.Although the bandits had a higher number of people than the mercenaries, their strength and teamwork were lacking in discipline in comparison to the mercenaries, who had spent a good portion of their time with each other. So when the two fought, despite having superior numbers, the bandits were fighting on equal grounds with the mercenaries.Jian Chen continued to travel back and forth as he dodged attacks from all directions, while stabbing out with his bloody Light Wind Sword towards each bandit\u2019s heart and throat. Almost each move was a fatal blow, and for those who did not get hit in one of those two areas, Jian Chen\u2019s sword still left severe injuries deep enough to see bone. None of the bandits around him had any way of fighting back against Jian Chen; most of them couldn\u2019t even see his sword move. Whenever the bandits slashed with their weapons, at the most crucial point, Jian Chen would evade the swing. Before they could understand what had just happened, they would all fall to the floor dead.The amount of bandits killed at Jian Chen\u2019s hands was growing in number. Gradually, all of the bandits were starting to recognize Jian Chen\u2019s strength, and began to distance themselves from him. After all, in such a tense situation like this, no one was willing to send themselves to die that foolishly.\u201cYour grace has such amazing skill, allow me to test it out.\u201d At that moment, a deep voice growled out before a cyan colored ray of light shot towards Jian Chen rapidly.Feeling the energy leak away from the cyan streak of light, Jian Chen\u2019s face changed suddenly as he realized this newcomer was very strong. The enemy was so strong, in fact, that Jian Chen did not dare to go head on against him; otherwise he would take on serious injuries.The cyan streak of light traveled quickly through the air. In a flash, it had already reached Jian Chen. At that moment, Jian Chen\u2019s face hardened, as he immediately focused his body to the extreme and leapt to the side to dodge it.The attack had brushed against Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder before slamming into the ground with a loud \u201cBang!\u201d, leaving behind a huge hole.Jian Chen immediately retreated 15 meters away from his enemy, before stopping to take a look at the hole in the ground, then lifting his head back up. In the night, Jian Chen could make out the figure of the one that had attacked him so fiercely.Seeing his attacker to be around 30 or 40 years old male, Jian Chen didn\u2019t think the man was sturdy looking at all. His plain looking clothes caused the man to appear extremely ordinary. If the man didn\u2019t have his right hand raised up to its full height with a cyan colored Guan Dao in his hand, he would not look threatening at all. Nothing about him was remarkable enough to draw a person\u2019s attention towards him.Translation Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GuandaoWhile Jian Chen was measuring the male in front of him, the man was calmly staring back at Jian Chen while saying, \u201cYou\u2019re quite strong, so your opponent has to be me!\u201d He looked at Jian Chen with an even stare. It seemed as if Jian Chen was the only one in his eyes right now; the man seemed to completely ignore the screams and shouts ringing out around them.Jian Chen\u2019s vision slowly swept his surroundings. The man stood in a position amongst the bandits that clearly stated his status wasn\u2019t low. Although there were still plenty of bandits around Jian Chen, once they had seen the man fight against Jian Chen, they had all started to drift towards other mercenaries to fight.Jian Chen\u2019s face changed as he realized that this would be the first life or death battle he would be involved in ever since his arrival in this new world. Despite being a veteran of over a hundred battles, and having confidence that he was unrivalled in the ways of the sword, Jian Chen was not at all sure that he would be able to land a killing blow on this new person. Based on the man\u2019s previous attack, the man\u2019s strength was stronger than his own, and since the man\u2019s attribute was wind, his movements wouldn\u2019t be any slower either.The middle aged man looked at Jian Chen and slowly brought his Guan Dao higher into the air. The blade of the Guan Dao enwrapped itself in a cyan glow as the wind slowly revolved around the man.Taking note of the man\u2019s movement, Jian Chen\u2019s focus reached its peak as he prepared himself. Even if he were to use the Profound Steps, his enemy\u2019s strength was far too strong, and with his wind attribute Saint Force that made him specialized in speed, he didn\u2019t dare find out what the outcome would be.\u201cHa!\u201dSuddenly, the man shouted loudly and dashed forward at a mighty speed towards Jian Chen. The middle aged man\u2019s speed was almost terrifying, and in the blink of an eye, the Guan Dao was almost invisible as it swung down onto Jian Chen\u2019s neck.Jian Chen\u2019s head tilted to the side as the Guan Dao swept past his head. As the blade came downwards, a few strands of hair were cut from Jian Chen\u2019s head.As Jian Chen\u2019s head bent to one side, he leaned his body forward and immediately strided out. Rapidly closing in onto the man, his Light Wind Sword flashed with a bloody red as it lashed out like lightning towards the man\u2019s heart.Against the stronger male, Jian Chen was pulling out all of the stops without hesitation. Jian Chen\u2019s speed was so fast that it was his current physical limit; in the blink of an eye, the Light Wind Sword had already hit the middle aged man\u2019s stomach. The tip of the sword immediately became wrapped in Sword Qi as it pierced through the man\u2019s body.Seeing the tip of the sword pierced his body, the middle aged man\u2019s expression suddenly changed to one of shock. However, the middle aged man reacted soon afterwards, and the strong Saint Force from within him had been drained. The ultimate form of a weapon being to able to fiercely attack and defend at close range was important. Although, the Saint Force surrounding his body was just as thin as he thought it was initially.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite this, the force of his thrust decreased as it was forced through his protective shell. The tip of the sword didn\u2019t falter at all as it continued to stab through towards the middle aged man. The initial two defenses the man had put up had been smashed to pieces, but by the time the Light Wind Sword broke through the hindrances, the man had already drawn upon his wind attribute Saint Force to immediately propel himself backwards.The middle aged man stood a few meters away as he stared at Jian Chen hard in the face. His own expression hardened as he spoke, \u201cWhat incredible speed.\u201dJian Chen looked back at the man without saying a word. He felt okay even after pushing himself to his limits. He had pushed his speed to a rate he had never achieved before. But his attack was essentially dodged by the man, so if Jian Chen wanted to land a killing blow on this man in the future, it would be a lot harder. After all, the man\u2019s strength was not weaker than Jian Chen\u2019s, and he was also a wind attribute Saint. He would definitely specialize in speed. In other words, it could be said that against this middle-aged man, Jian Chen had lost any type of advantage.Regardless of how exquisite his swordplay was, if it wasn\u2019t faster than the opponent\u2019s reaction time, everything would be of no use. In addition, since there was a great difference in their strengths, Jian Chen didn\u2019t dare to fight the middle-aged man at close quarters.\u201cYour strength has already reached Saint Master, right?\u201d Jian Chen asked, his gaze fixed on the middle-aged man opposite of him.The man didn\u2019t bother to hide his shock, \u201cCorrect, my strength is at the Middle Saint Master level.\u201d After saying that, he broke off from talking before looking at Jian Chen with an odd stare, \u201cYour strength on the other hand isn\u2019t all that strong, and neither is your wind attribute. Your speed just now wasn\u2019t slow at all though, so I\u2019m not sure how exactly you reached such a speed.\u201d The man said in a curious tone. Right now his mind really wanted to know the answer. As a person with the wind attribute, if he was beaten in any other aspects, he wouldn\u2019t have thought much about it. But in terms of surpassing him in speed, this raised a question that he couldn\u2019t easily give up on solving. Jian Chen had beaten him in speed while having much less strength than him and without having a wind attributed Saint Force, so the man couldn\u2019t help but be curious.\u201cMy apologies, but I have no comment about this question.\u201d Jian Chen replied evenly.Hearing this, the other man\u2019s stare hardened as he sneered, \u201cIf you tell me what trick you did in order to make yourself faster, then I will let you leave this place alive. Otherwise, hmph, do you think you could be a match for me with that type of speed?\u201d\u201cWhether or not I am able to keep up, why don\u2019t you come and see?\u201d Jian Chen replied to the man\u2019s threat. Jian Chen wasn\u2019t scared; on the contrary, he was now fully prepared to fight as he clenched the still bloody Light Wind Sword. It continued to emit Sword Qi from the tip of the blade, and it surrounded Jian Chen\u2019s entire body.The man continued to stare at Jian Chen; the glare in his eye never receded. In his mind, he still had some misgivings about Jian Chen\u2019s speed. Although Jian Chen had such a fast rate of speed, he did not have a wind attributed Saint Force, so he did not have the inborn advantage that the middle aged man had. Still, he wasn\u2019t able to replicate Jian Chen\u2019s speed himself\u2013dodging the sword strike from earlier had taken all of his strength to pull off. If he was just a tiny bit slower, then the man had no doubts that his own heart would have been pierced straight through. For that reason, he was somewhat afraid of the consequences of fighting against Jian Chen.Not only that, but looking at Jian Chen\u2019s unblemished clothes, he could roughly guess how fast Jian Chen could move without breaking a sweat. If Jian Chen could move so fast continuously like this, then it would eventually take a huge strain on him.Seeing how the man wasn\u2019t attacking, Jian Chen also began to idle about, and began to slowly watch every single movement. Jian Chen knew that in this case, where his speed was slower than his enemy, then his chances of landing a fatal blow on the man would be practically non-existent. All he could do now was to hinder the man so that he wouldn\u2019t be able to kill the weaker mercenaries. If he waited long enough, then the mercenary experts would come back and help deal with him instead of Jian Chen.The fighting didn\u2019t stop as the two stared at each other. The sounds of battle could still be heard, as both sides kept losing more of their numbers. The floor was dyed red with blood to the point that on some bumpy ground, puddles of blood had formed.The bandits continued to fight with everything they had. The people who managed to survive were excellent figures that had either outstanding brains or brawn. At the moment, both the mercenaries and bandits had an equal amount of people.The two continued to stand there before finally, one of them made a move. With the wind enwrapping the Guan Dao, the blade resembled a crescent moon in the night as the man ran towards Jian Chen with the 2 meter long blade in hand.Seeing the man come forward to attack, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously as he brought his Light Wind Sword up in preparation to defend.The man brought his cyan Guan Dao down towards Jian Chen\u2019s head at an extremely fast speed.Since he was fighting a Middle Saint Master, Jian Chen didn\u2019t plan on meeting this attack head on, and nimbly dodged to the side.However, as Jian Chen stabbed with his sword, the man\u2019s Guan Dao changed direction in midair and whistled through the air, as it parried Jian Chen\u2019s sword.Jian Chen\u2019s face changed as he immediately brought back his sword, reluctant to go against the man\u2019s Guan Dao.Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword was the equivalent to his Saint Force\u2019s life. His life was connected to the frail looking sword, so if his sword were to be injured, then Jian Chen\u2019s own life would be too. And if his Light Wind Sword were to break then Jian Chen would lose all of his cultivation, and his life would be threatened.On the Tian Yuan Continent, the cases in which people had died due to their Saint Weapons being broken were commonly seen. It practically happened everywhere. But with the Saint Weapon being a representation of one\u2019s inner Saint Force\u2019s condensation, when summoned outside the body, it would become unimaginably hard. Moreover, it would grow harder as the owner improved. Thus, unless one were to fight someone stronger than him by a large amount, their Saint Weapons would never break.Since his opponent\u2019s strength was already at the Middle Saint Master, he was higher than Jian Chen\u2019s strength by two whole levels. So if Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword were to collide against the man\u2019s Guan Dao, then he would definitely take some damage. Jian Chen couldn\u2019t afford this happening, so he had to try to avoid a collision between the weapons at all cost; after all, he would be the only one to suffer from a loss.Once again dodging the man\u2019s attack, Jian Chen noticed the man\u2019s defenses momentarily showing a large gap. Taking advantage of the rare opportunity, Jian Chen immediately moved towards the man with a silent Profound Steps and stabbed the Light Wind Sword towards the man\u2019s back with a red flash . The sword whistled silently as it traveled through the air, the sound making it seem like the sword had cut through the air itself. Its speed had reached its peak as it approached the man\u2019s back. Enveloped with Sword Qi, the sword slashed through the man\u2019s clothing, and then embedded itself into his back, breaking through his skin.Feeling a painful sensation in his back, the man\u2019s face changed immediately, but he displayed no signs of immediate panic. He hadn\u2019t been fully prepared for Jian Chen\u2019s speed, so the wound on his back continued to spray blood as his Saint Force condensed itself to take care of his wounds. At the same time, the man began to glow bright with cyan light as his speed started to increase rapidly. Before he could even leave a shadow on the ground or for Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword to completely stab into his back, the man immediately leaned towards the side and escaped from the Light Wind Sword\u2019s range.The man had already guessed that Jian Chen would stab out with all his strength. At this moment Jian Chen\u2019s own guard was at its weakest. Thus, the middle aged man also grasped onto this difficult opportunity. Dodging the stab, he immediately brought his Guan Dao high into the air, causing the twinkling cyan color of light to resemble a dazzling moon in the night. With the Guan Dao left high in the air, it emitted a sharp glow as it flew towards Jian Chen. This blow contained all of the man\u2019s remaining strength.Seeing how Jian Chen had fought earlier, the man had already known from previous experiences that Jian Chen would be a hard opponent. Due to Jian Chen\u2019s bountiful battle experience, he never had any holes in his defenses. So no matter if it was his attack or defense, his style of fighting could be said to be flawless, with absolutely no gaps. This was especially true since his sword had used all of Jian Chen\u2019s abilities this time. Most likely, the only situation where the man could\u2019ve heavily damaged Jian Chen was if Jian Chen\u2019s technique wasn\u2019t strong enough. Thus, the middle-aged man didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of holding back this attack of his.The Guan Dao streaked across the air so quickly, that if it was aimed towards weaker people, then they would have had no time to react at all.\u201cHua!\u201dWith an explosive shout, the man brought the cyan colored Guan Dao down towards the defenseless Jian Chen\u2019s head. From his upper body stroke, the Guan Dao did not decrease in speed at all and smashed fiercely into the ground.The smash contained all of the man\u2019s strength as the Guan Dao exploded into the ground. The blade of the Guan Dao sent all of the surrounding dirt flying into the air, creating a huge hole a meter in diameter. At the same time, Jian Chen\u2019s silhouette had completely disintegrated due to this sudden move.However on the man\u2019s face, not a single trace of happiness could be seen; instead, his face hardened in annoyance.\u201cAn afterimage!\u201d The man cried out in alarm. However, as his mind came to this conclusion, an intense feeling of a crisis struck the man\u2019s thoughts. Without hesitation, the man leapt towards the side with his natural reflexes, simultaneously picking up his Guan Dao from the ground and blindly swinging it behind himself.\u201cDing!\u201dA loud sound could be heard as the man\u2019s Guan Dao swung back and suddenly collided with the Jian Chen\u2019s bloody sword.Just as the sword and Guan Dao collided, Jian Chen\u2019s face suddenly changed. He immediately paled as he felt an intense churning sensation in his stomach, and he immediately retreated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no longer an easy-going look on his face. Instead, he was now deathly pale.There was just too much of a difference between their strengths. Jian Chen could only compete on even ground in terms of agility, but he had just taken a huge loss from the collision between their Saint Weapons. Although it hadn\u2019t done too much damage to him, the middle aged man\u2019s Saint Force was many times stronger than Jian Chen\u2019s, and that blow alone had caused his Light Wind Sword to transmit a huge shock wave which caused some minor internal injuries.The man steadied himself as he stared down Jian Chen. This had been the third time he had nearly taken damage, so he didn\u2019t dare belittle Jian Chen anymore. Although Jian Chen was weaker than him, he was relying on a speed that was faster than the man\u2019s own. This was a major threat to the man, and he had acknowledged that Jian Chen was stronger than someone of the man\u2019s level.However, as he looked at the state Jian Chen was in, he suddenly understood what had just happened and began to laugh, \u201cBrat, I admit that you are very fast, but your strength is just far too weak.\u201d Without even waiting for Jian Chen to catch his breath, he immediately flew forward with his 2 meter long Guan Dao ready to cleave him in two.Because of the collision between the Light Wind Sword and the Guan Dao, Jian Chen had suffered some damage. Since his opponent was two levels higher than himself and had reached Middle Saint level, the impacts of these light injuries were fatal. After all, Jian Chen had been able to use the Profound Steps to fight against his opponent during his peak state only. But now that he was in an injured state, he was no longer capable of being so nimble; dodging attacks had already expended his energy.As the man continued to exchange blows with Jian Chen, he had realized that the threat Jian Chen originally was to him was slowly decreasing, causing his guard to similarly slacken. Using all of his strength, he struck out towards Jian Chen, hoping for a fatal blow. His speed was even faster than before.With the man\u2019s speed growing faster, Jian Chen was using up more and more energy. If he was in perfect condition, then not only would Jian Chen have an easier time dodging the man, but he would have been able to fight back as well. But now that he was injured, he could only dodge without attacking, and since the man was quickly increasing his movement speed, Jian Chen\u2019s every dodge was getting more and more dangerous.The man\u2019s blows were getting exponentially faster. He managed to attack dozens of time within an instant, and at this point, blood-stained cuts had appeared in Jian Chen\u2019s clothes, since he no longer had the ability to counter. However, it could be seen that Jian Chen\u2019s wounds weren\u2019t very deep.The cyan colored light lit up the night as the man\u2019s Guan Dao cut through the night air towards Jian Chen.Although Jian Chen tried his best to dodge the blade, his movements had already become a lot slower than before, and so he failed to dodge it completely. The Guan Dao left a cut so deep that the bone could be seen on his chest, and a torrent of blood started to leak out onto Jian Chen\u2019s clothes.The man gave a fierce laugh as he continued to slash at him. Taking advantage of how Jian Chen didn\u2019t move away, the man drew closer. Lightning fast, he kicked out his right foot covered in a cyan light at Jian Chen\u2019s chest.\u201cBang!\u201dThe man\u2019s kicked sent Jian Chen flying backwards like a bullet. While his body was in the air, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but spit out a mouthful of blood. as he flew 20 meters backwards past a few bandits before falling to the ground. Afterwards, Jian Chen spat out another mouthful of blood. By now, his face had turned deathly white.With a cyan flash of light, the man strode over 20 meters towards the floored Jian Chen and sneered, \u201cI\u2019ll give you this one last chance. If you tell me whatever secret it is that made you so fast, then I\u2019ll spare your life. If not, then you will die!\u201d The man\u2019s eyes flashed with blazing curiosity, and his heart raced at the thought of becoming faster with Jian Chen\u2019s technique. To a wind attributed person, speed was an extremely crucial thing to him. Although he didn\u2019t dare to think that his speed would reach a new level, he was certain it would improve his strength and increase his position within the Boundless Bandits.Thinking about this, the man felt extremely excited. He trembled almost as if he was angry, but he was actually stirred up from his emotions.Jian Chen wiped away the blood from his mouth and slowly stood back up as he glared at the man with an icy look. With a small sneer, he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not strong enough for it.\u201d Despite just being dealt a serious injury, Jian Chen didn\u2019t seem to fear the difference in strength between them.As he talked, Jian Chen was readjusting himself into a relaxed position, almost as if he wasn\u2019t bothering to guard himself. His right hand had loosened up his grip on his sword; his current state was completely different from the previous him..Jian Chen\u2019s words caused the other man\u2019s face to sink. He snorted, \u201cBrat, with your strength, you don\u2019t have the qualifications to say that. If you\u2019re not willing to tell me, then you\u2019d better be prepared to suffer for your own actions.\u201d Mid-speech, the man had already started to run towards Jian Chen with his Guan Dao swinging down at Jian Chen\u2019s right shoulder.Despite seeing the man approach, Jian Chen showed no signs of wanting to dodge. Instead, he brought his sword back up. Although his sword was moving at the same speed, it appeared as if the sword was as light as a feather, and was floating elegantly in the air. This was completely different from the killing intent he had previously displayedThe Light Wind Sword and Guan Dao collided with each other without making any sound. Afterwards, the softer looking Light Wind Sword attached onto the Guan Dao like a maggot on a wound, and diverted the Guan Dao\u2019s original trajectory. The sword twisted itself in a circle a few times, and immediately transferred the momentum of the Guan Dao cleanly towards the side, causing it to fall to the ground.The man\u2019s face changed as he looked at Jian Chen with amazement. Just now, he had been unable to control the movements of his own Guan Dao. If he had been facing an opponent that was only slightly weaker than him, then he wouldn\u2019t have been so amazed. But against Jian Chen who was by far the inferior person, the man was not really able to accept what had just happened.\u201cWhat technique was that?\u201d The man asked with a look of disbelief.\u201cTai Ji Jian\u201d Jian Chen answered. When it came to Tai Ji Jian, he wasn\u2019t all that proficient at it. However, he had still been in contact with it enough times to understand the Tai Ji Jian\u2019s philosophy of \u201cusing softness to conquer strength\u201d; it was the principle of deflecting weapons. Now that he was not only weaker than his opponent, but also in a state where his energy was all but gone now, Jian Chen was forced to use the Tai Ji Jian techniques that he wasn\u2019t very proficient in to block the attack.TL Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaijijianTai Ji Jian emphasized the idea of \u201cusing softness to conquer strength\u201d in order for the weak to beat the strong. With the ability to deflect attacks in such a way, this would prove to be extremely beneficial to Jian Chen at this current moment. The only flaw was that Jian Chen only had a few ideas on what Tai Ji Jian was like, and was not good at it at all. After all, he was a master of the One Hand Swift Sword style. Nonetheless, it was proving helpful to Jian Chen against the man at that moment.The man\u2019s eyebrows creased together as he ran the word through his head. Soon after, he shook his head and said, \u201cTai Ji Jian, I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d His eyes looked at Jian Chen in a confused manner before laughing, \u201cBrat, although you\u2019re quite weak, I didn\u2019t think you would know so many techniques. It seems that killing you would be a waste; I should capture you instead. This would be a pretty great favor towards you as well.\u201d The man moved towards Jian Chen once more with his Saint Force enhanced Guan Dao in hand. He had came to a decision that no matter what, he would capture Jian Chen. Although the Tai Ji Jian technique wasn\u2019t something he was extremely determined to learn, the man seriously wanted to figure out the technique that had allowed Jian Chen to move so fast.Jian Chen used his Tai Ji Jian to deal with his opponent. With its profound ways of dealing with each attack from the man, the man felt as if he no longer had any control over his own Guan Dao.Although he wasn\u2019t very proficient in it, Jian Chen\u2019s Tai Ji Jian made the man\u2019s strong strength seem practically non-existent. However, it was taking an extraordinary amount of effort on Jian Chen\u2019s part. Despite Tai Ji Jian allowing one to deflect and divert another person\u2019s attacks, Jian Chen was only just a Saint, so it was taking all of his energy to break away the man\u2019s monstrous strength from his Guan Dao and send it elsewhere. So while it looked easy to do, it was actually hard to pull off.But using Tai Ji Jian was only a temporary defensive method, and not an offensive one. He could only block attacks without being able to capitalize on an opportunity to attack. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that his opponent was pressuring him with his attacks, then Jian Chen would definitely not use the Tai Ji Jian.After a few more moments of close combat, the man was gradually getting angrier and angrier. Every single time he had struck out towards the weaker person, Jian Chen had used his strange technique to change the trajectory of his attack. This caused him to lose control of his Saint Weapon, and to him, this was utter humiliation.\u201cYou bastard, I don\u2019t believe that this is all I can do to you!\u201d The man flew into a rage. He was no longer able to contain his fury, as he continued to curse at Jian Chen fiercely.Soon after, the man\u2019s strength grew even stronger, causing Jian Chen to struggle even more to defend himself. His face was already drenched with sweat as his Saint Force was slowly starting to dry up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, Jian Chen was still using all of his might to use his barely proficient knowledge of Tai Ji Jian to deflect the man\u2019s moves. Each time Jian Chen had blocked and diverted the enemy\u2019s Guan Dao, a large part of his Saint Force was used up. With the both of them fiercely fighting it out, they had already used up more than half of their Saint Forces\u2019. Since Jian Chen had a serious gash across his chest, he was starting to feel quite weak as time went on, even just blocking was getting harder now.Jian Chen\u2019s beginning Saint strength was able to contend with a Middle Saint Master thanks to his higher expertise with the sword and his past experiences from the countless number of battles he had been in his past life. If it was another person with Jian Chen\u2019s strength, then it would be hard to say if they would be able to last 10 rounds against the man\u2019s storm-like blows.After all, the difference between a Saint and a Saint Master was huge; there were at least two levels separating the two.The cyan colored blade ripped through the air once more as it slashed down towards the Light Wind Sword. At last, Jian Chen wasn\u2019t able to deflect the Guan Dao\u2019s frightening power, and his sword was sent recoiling backwards. While the Light Wind Sword wasn\u2019t hurt in any way, it had been forced back into Jian Chen\u2019s chest with a loud bang.The crash caused Jian Chen to be sent flying backwards 10 meters, before falling onto the ground. He spat out yet another mouthful of blood, filling the sky with droplets of it.\u201cBrat, I can tell that you don\u2019t even have the energy to escape from my blows now. Just be obedient and come along with me.\u201d The man sneered. Without waiting for Jian Chen to answer, he moved once more, and in a flash, he appeared 10 meters ahead where Jian Chen was. He reached out, and grabbed at Jian Chen neck with both hands.Coldly looking at the man come closer with his hands outstretched, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed with a dangerous glint as he inwardly sighed, \u201cAi, seems like I have to use my last resort.\u201dThe last resort was Jian Chen\u2019s ultimate life saving skill. It was the one skill that only he within the Tian Yuan Continent would know\u2013the Soul Sword.The Soul Sword was learned back when he had fought against Dugu Qiubai a long time ago. At his moment of death, he had made a breakthrough and learned this supreme skill.Yet, just as Jian Chen was about to use his ultimate skill in this predicament, a bright red glow of light suddenly filled up the night sky. It headed towards the middle aged man, who was currently about to capture Jian Chen.Seeing the giant red sword out of the corner of his eye, the man let loose a look of disdain as he gave a gentle snort. Moving away from Jian Chen, the cyan colored glow in his right arm began to brighten dramatically, essentially covering his entire arm in a shroud. The man\u2019s wind attributed Saint Force enhanced arm lashed towards the fiery red sword, firmly catching it in his hand.Taking advantage of this situation, Jian Chen immediately crawled up from the ground and looked at the person who had rescued him with a gratuitous look.The owner of the red sword was a mercenary that looked to be around 20 or 30 years old with an ordinary appearance\u2013the type of person that would blend in with a crowd easily. Yet, this mercenary was no stranger to Jian Chen; this was the kind person he had talked to on the road\u2013Mu Yun.The middle aged man sneered at the sword wielding Mu Yun, \u201cYou overestimate yourself.\u201dHearing the man talk, Mu Yun expressed a strange smile and laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re only just a Middle Saint Master yourself, not all that much stronger than me. I can say what I please.\u201d Mu Yun\u2019s sword emitted a splendid glow as well as a high temperature. In the night, his sword lit up the area around them with a strong glow. The temperature around them also steadily increased. In just a few moments, the red sword became entirely enshrouded in a blinding fiery red. The light constantly pulsated, making it seem as if the sword was actually on fire.Feeling the Saint Force surge in endless waves from the sword, the man furrowed his eyebrows together. He let go of the blade, and then fiercely slammed his hand against the blade.\u201cBang!\u201dReceiving the energy-filled blow from the man, Mu Yun\u2019s sword was sent towards the side. But with Mu Yun\u2019s battle experience, he took advantage of this sudden movement to whirl around. The sword traveled in a circular motion as Mu Yun immediately slashed at the man once more.\u201cSince you want to die, I\u2019ll grant you your wish!\u201d The man bellowed, his Guan Dao flashing with a cyan glow as he waved his weapon around. A gentle breeze accompanied his weapon as it flew towards the fire red sword.\u201cClang!\u201dMu Yun\u2019s sword and the man\u2019s Guan Dao collided with each other, causing a loud metallic sound to ring out. The moment the two Saint Weapons separated, Mu Yun staggered 10 meters backwards. On the other hand, the middle-aged man stood as steady as Mt Tai, without any indication of moving.A single glance was enough to see who was the weaker one, and who was the stronger one.Standing on the side, Jian Chen knew that Mu Yun was still weaker than the other man by a large amount. However, Mu Yun was still stronger than himself, and by Jian Chen\u2019s estimates, Mu Yun\u2019s strength should put him between a Middle Great Saint or a Peak Great Saint. Despite this, he was still much weaker than the other man. Since the man specialized in speed thanks to his wind attribute, he was weaker in terms of attack strength than the fire attributed Mu Yun. The fire attribute was the rarest attribute after the light and dark attributes, and it was publically known as the strongest attribute in terms of strength.If the man relied on his wind attributed Saint Force to fight, then he would be able to dominate the fire attributed Mu Yun. And if the man were to show the special characteristics of his wind attribute and fight against Mu Yun, then Jian Chen was certain that Mu Yun would not be able to last long in a fight against him.But if he and Mu Yun were to join together and fight, then he was sure that they would be able to beat the middle aged man.The unfortunate thing was that Jian Chen had taken in heavy damages already; the vital parts of his body had each taken a beating from the fight. In his current state, helping Mu Yun was out of the question. Just standing there was already an abnormally strenuous task.Attacking Mu Yun, the middle aged man\u2019s eyes flashed with strong killing intent. He didn\u2019t give Mu Yun time to even readjust himself before gathering the wind around his Guan Dao, and rushing forward, leaving only an after image where he had stood earlier. In an instant, he appeared in front of Mu Yun, and chopped at his head with extreme speed.When it came to Mu Yun, the other man didn\u2019t restrain himself. The moment Mu Yun appeared, the man had tried to kill him. After all, Mu Yun didn\u2019t have any special characteristics that peaked his interest.Mu Yun\u2019s face hardened. He shouted in anger as the sword in his hand suddenly grew even more red, emitting a boiling hot temperature. At the same time, a flame burst into existence and engulfed the sword within itself. With the fire sword, Mu Yun then brandished it towards the wind wrapped Guan Dao.The moment Mu Yun waved his sword, it transformed into three giant snakes of fire. The first two flew out towards the Guan Dao, while the last one flew towards the enemy himself.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Guan Dao and the fire snakes collided with a huge crash. The two flaming snakes had been cut in half by the Guan Dao, causing sparks to fly out everywhere. If one were to look at it from far away, the sight looked like it was a flower that was getting ready to bloom.While the first two snakes had been stopped by the Guan Dao, the third snake had become like a fierce tiger, increasing in temperature as it traveled through the air towards the man.Just as the third fire snake was flying towards the middle aged man, his right hand loosened its grip on the Guan Dao. The man gathered the wind Saint Force into his fist, and blew it out towards the fire snake.The fist made contact with the fire snake causing a resonating crash. Dispersing into the air, the fire snake sent sparks flying throughout the night sky for a while before disappearing into the night.After blowing the fire snake apart with his fist, the man stopped his attack to glance at Mu Yu in astonishment as he cried out in alarm, \u201cThis is a battle skill, to think you actually knew one.\u201d No one had discovered that the man\u2019s right fist had actually turned bright red, and had even swelled up in size.Hearing what the man said, Jian Chen looked at Mu Yun with an amazed look. Jian Chen wasn\u2019t very familiar with battle skills, but he knew that they were a cultivational treasure within the Tian Yuan Continent. It was possible to increase one\u2019s strength multiple times with them, and were not things that ordinary people would be able to get their hands on. Jian Chen hadn\u2019t thought that the ordinary looking mercenary like Mu Yun would unexpectedly have such an expensive item. Since battle skills were so rare and expensive, even Great Saint Masters couldn\u2019t possibly possess them.Battle skills had both high and low points. Although this was the first time Jian Chen had left his home to travel in the Tian Yuan Continent, he had read many books in the library, and thus was not inferior in any way to some of the more experienced mercenaries in terms of knowledge. With his foresight, he could tell with a single glance that both Mu Yun\u2019s battle skills and cultivation methods were definitely top-ranked. This was because ordinary battle skills and cultivation methods were nowhere adequate enough to be able to produce material flames based on just Mu Yun\u2019s strength as a Great Saint.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s right, this is indeed a battle skill!\u201dThe man inhaled sharply as he looked at Mu Yun with a greedy expression. Battle skills were highly treasured on the Tian Yuan Continent, and aside from the clans that spanned across multiple generations and experts, no other ordinary cultivator would have one. Although some cultivators came across some battle skills by luck, such occurrences were very few in Tian Yun Continent. If one didn\u2019t have a profound destiny and extreme fortune, then the chances of getting a battle skill were practically nonexistent.Although the man was a Middle Saint Master and was considered a strong expert in the Boundless Bandits, he still hadn\u2019t grasped a battle skill yet. Just the sight of one had him drooling. Unfortunately for him, his strength didn\u2019t reach the qualifications necessary to receive a battle skill from the bandits.The middle-aged man lightly moved his right fist, and felt a flash of burning hot pain. But he did not have any anger in his heart, and was feeling quite excited instead. With his knowledge, one look was enough to distinguish that the battle skill that Mu Yun had used was highly advanced. Although he was a wind attribute, this did not stop the man from desiring the fire attributed battle skill at all. After all, battle skills were priceless treasures on the Tian Yuan Continent, and the stronger the skill, the more expensive it was.\u201cHaha, the gods have certainly been looking out for me today. Youngsters, your techniques will become mine!\u201d The man laughed loudly with extreme excitement. To him, both Jian Chen\u2019s secret speed technique and Mu Yun\u2019s battle skill would be easily taken and learned.\u201cHow arrogant! You look too highly upon yourself.\u201d Mu Yun sneered. Raising his hand, the red sword immediately ignited as the flames lit up the night. Slashing at the man, the hidden aura of the sword spread out in every direction. However, the amount was so small that its aura was virtually undetectable.But for someone like Jian Chen who had a powerful \u201cSoul\u201d, this faint aura could clearly be detected. The moment he had realized the source of the aura, his eyes widened in surprise.Seeing the sword bring forth a blatantly powerful pressure, the man sneered, \u201cBrat, although you have a special battle skill, your strength is still far too weak!\u201d The moment the fiery greatsword made contact with the man\u2019s clothes, he disappeared into an after image, causing Mu Yun\u2019s sword to swish into empty air.The instant the man disappeared from sight, Mu Yun\u2019s face hardened in concentration. Suddenly, an ear-piercing whistle of a blade could be heard coming from the back. Mu Yun instantaneously changed his sword into three giant snakes and made it fly behind him. While in mid-air, the three snakes fused together, and turned into an even bigger fire serpent.\u201cClang!\u201dThe sound of metal hitting something resonated through the air as the fire serpent engulfed both Mu Yun and his opponent. The collision had caused the fire to spread out in every direction for a few dozen meters. When the red ripple of energy swept past Jian Chen, their extremely hot temperatures caused Jian Chen\u2019s clothes to blacken from the heat. If it were not for the fact that his clothes were already damp from his blood, then his clothes might have spontaneously ignited into flames.In the brilliant blaze, both Mu Yun and the middle aged man staggered backwards, the both of them looked haggard from the trade off. Mu Yun\u2019s originally tidy hair had become messy, while his face had become pale in color. Even his fiery greatsword had started to lose a bit of its luster.As for the middle aged man, while he had been enveloped by his wind attributed Saint Force, his clean clothes had already started to show signs of burn spots. Both of his sleeves had already been blown apart.Because of the use of a battle skill, the fight between Mu Yun and the middle aged man was on a much larger scale than the man\u2019s fight with Jian Chen. The blaze attracted both the mercenaries and bandits around them, causing both sides to immediately notice the fight out of the corners of their eyes. The moment they saw the radiant blaze, some of the mercenaries further away cried out in astonishment.\u201cThose are real flames! Unless one is an Earth Saint Master, it\u2019s impossible to summon flames out of nowhere. Could it be\u2026that\u2019s a battle skill!?\u201d\u201cBattle skill? It\u2019s a battle skill!\u201d\u201cSo someone here knew a battle skill!\u201dWhether it was a bandit or mercenary, when they saw that Mu Yun possessed a battle skill, they all cried out in amazement. None of them could believe what they were seeing. Battle skills were extremely rare and expensive on the Tian Yuan Continent. Common mercenaries would normally live their lives without even once witnessing a battle skill.After their shocks wore off, every mercenary\u2019s and bandit\u2019s eyes started to fill with greed. Battle skills were what cultivators in the Tian Yuan Continent desired most; their thirst for these skills far surpassed their desires for cultivation methods. Battle skills allowed one to increase their strength many times more than usual, so many people often fought to the death for these skills. Having a battle skill meant gaining an additional source of protection.Seeing the greed in their eyes, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but to narrow his eyes. He knew just as much as anyone that people would become jealous of another person\u2019s strength. Mu Yun\u2019s battle skill had far surpassed what Jian Chen had thought, and now it had been revealed in front of all the mercenaries. Battle skills were treasured greatly, and would bring great trouble to those that had them. Even losing his life over this battle skill wasn\u2019t unlikely, since Mu Yun was still considered weak.Right now, not only did Jian Chen take comfort from Mu Yun, but he was also worried for his well-being. Although the two hadn\u2019t known each other for very long, and had only met due to chance, Jian Chen knew that Mu Yun had fought the middle aged man and revealed his battle skill for the sake of rescuing him.Looking at Mu Yun fervently, the man laughed, \u201cWhat an amazing battle skill. You even managed to block an attack that contained all my power as a Great Saint!\u201d He paused for a while before sneering once more, \u201cHowever, you could only temporarily block my Great Saint attack with the aid of the battle skill. Ultimately, it\u2019s not your own strength. I wonder how long you can last?\u201d After talking, he lifted his Guan Dao high into the air. Just as he prepared to slash down onto Mu Yun, another strong source of energy suddenly came flying over from the distance.Feeling the source of energy, the middle aged man grew joyous. He assumed that it was from the experts that the mercenary captains were trying to kill but failed, and his comrades were now coming to provide assistance for him.Arriving from the far away shadows, a few figures were running towards them at a rapid pace. In a few moments, the figures suddenly came into everyone\u2019s line of sight. The moment everyone could clearly see who they were, all the mercenaries cried out in joy.\u201cThe captains! The captains came back!\u201d\u201cCaptain Lang Tian, the captain came back victorious!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s Captain Xia Hou as well, they killed the experts of the Boundless Bandits!\u201dLit up by the intense blaze nearby, everyone could see that the five returning members had wounds of all sizes on them. Their clothes were drenched with blood, and some of them were even carrying corpses over their shoulders.Hearing the shouts from the mercenaries, the middle aged man and the other bandits all turned unsightly. Immediately, the man turned his head and stared at the returning Xia Hou and his men with a look of disbelief.\u201cHow\u2026just how\u2026how were you able to return alive?\u201d The man asked in disbelief as he swallowed some saliva nervously as he tried to get the words out. The middle aged man knew that their return indicated that his bandit group had already faced imminent disaster. Otherwise, the ones returning would have been his own faction\u2019s experts, not the mercenary group\u2019s people.The man\u2019s words caused all five members to look at him. Immediately, the five slowly put down the bodies they were carrying and glared at him with powerful murderous intent.Feeling the killing intent of the five, the middle aged man\u2019s heart raced. Without hesitation, he opened his mouth to say, \u201cThe situation is looking bad, everyone retreat!\u201d Without even finishing his sentence, the middle aged man had already dismissed his Guan Dao and used his fastest speed to run away. Although the five mercenaries were all somewhat injured, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. With five people, the middle aged man had no hopes of winning.The moment the man had started to move, two of the five mercenaries immediately chased after him.Hearing the man\u2019s earlier words, the bandits all started to give up the fight and scattered in all four directions.\u201cKill! Don\u2019t leave a single one alive!\u201dHearing that one command, all of the remaining mercenaries immediately sprung to follow it, and began to chase down the fleeing bandits. The mercenaries hated the Boundless Bandits down to their very bones, so they would had never let the bandits run off that easily.With their experts all dead and the only capable member running away, all of the bandits immediately focused on running away. All of their fighting spirit had practically been wiped out. On the other hand, the mercenaries had their courage bolstered after their captains had returned alive after defeating the experts from the Boundless Bandits. Even the ones who were exhausted had suddenly gained a new spurt of energy and did everything they could to chase and kill the bandits.The sounds of slaughter rang through the night, but it quickly became peaceful once more as as the remaining three mercenary experts led the mercenaries and killed the majority of the bandits. Only a few of the really fast ones had managed to run away with their lives.\u201cVictory! We\u2019ve won!\u201d\u201cThe Boundless Bandits were beaten by us!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve beaten the Boundless Bandits!\u201dOnce the battle came to a close, the remaining mercenaries all started to cheer loudly. The Boundless Bandits were a great nightmare to the mercenaries, the personification of the gods of death that couldn\u2019t be beaten. Beating the Boundless Bandits was definitely an achievement they were extremely proud of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These were the mercenaries that had chased after the middle aged man.The two males looked to be around 30 or 40 years old. Both of their faces were covered with blood and their bodies were filled with wounds which dyed their clothes scarlet with blood. However while their faces were pale from their fatigue, their eyes were still full of vigor.Seeing the two come back empty handed, it was clear that the middle aged man had escaped.\u201cAi, that guy has a wind attribute, so he had an advantage over us in speed. Although our strength was better than his, in our current condition, we weren\u2019t able to chase him, so he escaped in the end.\u201d One of the two said, his voice was brimming with regret.\u201cForget it, if he ran, he ran. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d run into the Boundless Bandits, no wonder they were so strong. If it weren\u2019t for our mysterious benefactor in the shadows, then I\u2019m afraid we wouldn\u2019t have been able to come back. For him to save our lives, he is definitely a trusted person.\u201d An older person said as he stood next to the brilliant flames, already his skin was starting to look a little tanned.Hearing the man talk, the other mercenaries who had returned after killing some bandits all were stunned. From their faces, all of them had some joy but some still had some lingering fear.\u201cCaptain Lang Tian, are you okay?\u201d A mercenary went up to the man and asked with a worried tone.The newly named Lang Tian slowly looked down on the various wounds before shaking his head, \u201cI\u2019ve some wounds, but nothing that\u2019ll kill me.\u201d He looked at the few mercenaries around him before sighing. With a sorrowful voice, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, Yun Bai Mu, the captain of the Desert Shadows Mercenaries was killed by the experts of the Boundless Bandits.\u201dHearing the announcement, many of the mercenaries started to grieve, especially the mercenaries of the Desert Shadows. It was a heavy blow to their mood, however, for travelers of the Tian Yuan Continent, seeing someone die was an experience many of them were used to. After a small period of mourning, many of the mercenaries had already become peaceful once more.\u201cMy comrades, although we managed to beat back the Boundless Bandits, this was only just a small group. If we were to come across a larger group or even their elites, then we will die on the road. So we cannot afford to stay here for long, hurry up and dress your wounds and bury our dead brothers. We will have to leave immediately afterwards.\u201d Lang Tian announced.Each mercenary immediately got to work by helping each other bandage their wounds and applying herbal medicine. Those who were healthier and less injured went to help dig holes and transport the bodies.Everyone set themselves to do their tasks in silence. No one talked at all, and as each mercenary did their own thing, the atmosphere was incomparably heavy.Jian Chen looked around himself before inwardly sighing, they had ultimately won against the Boundless Bandits, but to him, this was a wretched victory. After the course of one battle, the three mercenary groups had dwindled down to less than a hundred people that were for the most part injured. Their entire fighting capabilities had been reduced to a third of their original power, and from the original ten experts that had led the charge, only five of them returned with heavy wounds. One of the mercenary captains was killed in battle, causing another sharp decline in their power.\u201cJian Chen, are you alright? Are your wounds serious?\u201d A familiar voice called out behind Jian Chen.Hearing this, Jian Chen turned his head around to see Mu Yun. He didn\u2019t know when Mu Yun had got behind him, but he was there now.At the moment Mu Yun\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t all that good. His facial color was an abnormally pale one, and although he had looked fine while fighting against the middle aged man, the battle skill placed a heavy burden on Mu Yun after using it to surpass his strength.Jian Chen softly shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Pausing slightly, he looked at Mu Yun with a complicated look. \u201cMu Yun, your battle skill was revealed to every mercenary here. On the road, you\u2019ll have to be even more careful now, and when you reach a safe spot, get away from the group as far as possible. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll try to do something.\u201dMu Yun looked around at the busy mercenaries, \u201cJian Chen, I thank you for your concerns, I\u2019ll be careful from now on.\u201d Although he had said that, Mu Yun\u2019s expression did not look at all concerned at the people around him. When it came the mercenaries, Mu Yun did not see them as a challenge at all.Taking note of Mu Yun\u2019s unconcerned stare, Jian Chen was slightly amazed. Despite the strength Mu Yun had shown during his fight, Jian Chen didn\u2019t think would be able to protect himself within the group.Mu Yun took out a white jade bottle from his Space Ring and held it towards Jian Chen, \u201cThis is a top notch healing medication, drink it and heal yourself up.\u201d\u201cThanks!\u201d Jian Chen didn\u2019t decline his offer and took the bottle from him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019m going to treat my own wounds first and then go help the others.\u201d Mu Yun waved before walking away from Jian Chen.Two hours later, everything was in order as all the dead mercenaries were buried while ignoring the corpses of the Boundless Bandits. The mercenaries hated the Boundless Bandits even after they died, and so they wouldn\u2019t bother to pay their respects by burying their bodies.During those two hours, Jian Chen had casually treated his wounds and already swapped out the bloody clothes from his fight with the middle aged man with a new set. Before they had set out on the trip, Jian Chen had prepared a few dozen sets of clothes, so he wasn\u2019t worried about running out.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAfter everyone was ready, someone called out for them all to start moving. Everyone was prepared to move into the night without stopping for rest or sleep. Ever since the ambush by the Boundless Bandits, the caravans no longer wished to stay around any longer. Even taking a break would not do.After the ambush from the Boundless Bandits, the caravan\u2019s strength had been greatly diminished, leaving them with very little manpower. Since many members of the Boundless Bandits had escaped, if they were to bring back a bigger unit to attack them, then the caravan would not be able to survive, let alone think about trying to reverse such an abysmal situation.Jian Chen painstakingly climbed onto his own horse, and began to blindly follow the caravans in the dark. Atop the horse\u2019s back, Jian Chen sat with his eyes closed, as he quietly manipulated his Saint Force to heal his internal injuries. He had previously received quite a few heavy attacks from the middle-aged man, so the damage Jian Chen was suffering was quite severe. Moreover, he had consumed a large chunk of his internal Saint Force already, so his current body\u2019s condition made even the simplest movements difficult to carry out, let alone fighting. Since Jian Chen was currently traversing the Tian Yuan Continent, and could encounter danger at any moment, his strength was most important. Thus, Jian Chen continued to expend all his effort in trying to recover his own strength, without daring to stop for even a second.The caravan quickly advanced on the road. Since the people were afraid of reinforcements from the Boundless Bandits chasing them, their current speed was many times faster than their previous traveling pace. Despite this, it was still only slightly faster than the average person running at their peak speed. After all, the carriages contained many goods, so speeding up further was impossible, even if they wanted to. The current speed had already nearly flipped the carriages multiple times whenever they had passed through uneven parts of the road.Because of the current situation, Jian Chen didn\u2019t dare to completely enter a self-healing state. Thus, his severe injuries were only recovering at a snail\u2019s pace.At that moment, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but recall his mother, Bi Yun Tian. He still clearly remembered that time a few years ago when he had injured his third brother, Changyang Ke. Bi Yun Tian had unexpectedly healed his injuries as if it were the easiest thing in the world, without leaving a single scar. If there was a Radiant Saint Master at the scene right now, the internal injuries within his body would\u2019ve probably recovered faster. Unfortunately, Radiant Saint Masters were really too rare, and their statuses were highly esteemed. With the strengths of the three mercenary groups currently present, there was absolutely no way they could have invited a Radiant Saint Master.Just as Jian Chen had thought of Radiant Saint Masters, a divine light suddenly flashed within his mind. Immediately, he opened his previously closed eyes, and in that instant, a bright ray of light seemed to shoot out from his eyes in amazement, dying out immediately afterwards.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I can sense light Saint Force, and even gather it. I wonder if I can control the light Saint Force like a Radiant Saint Master would, and be able to heal my own wounds.\u201d Jian Chen pondered this furiously. When he recalled the possibility that he would be able to control light Saint Force just as Radiant Saint Masters could, his heart momentarily surged from the excitement, and was uncontrollably delighted at the thought.Ever since he saw Bi Yun Tian use light Saint Force to heal Changyang Ke\u2019s injuries back at the Changyang household, Jian Chen had realized that this power was exactly the special energy that he felt every time he absorbed the World Essence during cultivation. At the time, Jian Chen had really wanted to test and see if he could control the light Saint Force. Unfortunately, due to the various situations that had occurred since then, he never got to try testing his thoughts. Afterwards, this thought had gradually been pushed further and further back into his mind, and he had forgotten about it until just now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Chaotic Sword GodCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: Blue Wind KingdomJian Chen took a deep breath and slowly tried to control the emotions in his heart. After he had calmed, he immediately closed his eyes and began to cultivate the World Essence around him. However, there was a difference between the time he had absorbed World Essence\u00a0in the past compared to now; Jian Chen was able to differentiate the special energy from the World Essence and absorb that specific energy into his body.Although in theory this was rather simple, it required an extremely strenuous amount of effort when put into practice. However, to Jian Chen who had practiced how to use his \u201cSoul\u201d, this wasn\u2019t that hard; it would only require more concentration than usual.To the Jian Chen who was strong in spirit, he could detect the special energy mixed in with the World Essence. Aside from Radiant Saint Masters, no one else would be able to detect it. After he had detected the special energy, he immediately used his \u201cSoul\u201d as a vacuum to wildly bring the special energy towards him. As it gathered, Jian Chen absorbed it into his body.Jian Chen understood that once the special energy had condensed to a certain degree, it would emit a faint white glow. To prevent this from happening, Jian Chen absorbed the energy extremely slowly;almost at a snail\u2019s pace.After Jian Chen absorbed the special energy into his body, a reinvigorating sensation immediately spread throughout his body. It traveled so quickly that Jian Chen felt as if a ball of warmth had enveloped him. Being bathed inside with this pleasant sensation, Jian Chen\u2019s face let loose an expression of satisfaction.When the special energy fused with Jian Chen\u2019s serious injuries, they started to heal at an extremely fast rate, so fast that Jian Chen was flabbergasted and couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. With this, Jian Chen finally understood how fearsome a Radiant Saint Master was when they used their light attribute Saint Force to treat other people\u2019s injuries.\u201cThe books said that not only could high level Radiant Saint Masters regrow arms, they could even revive the dead. It would appear that this wasn\u2019t a lie. If they could heal injuries like this, then perhaps the Radiant Saint Masters who stood at the peak have truly transcendent skills.\u201d Before, Jian Chen had doubted that Radiant Saint Masters could regrow an arm and revive the dead, but after seeing the effectiveness of the energy they used, Jian Chen firmly believed that this was the truth.While riding, Jian Chen continued to use his Soul to take the Light Saint Force from within the World Essence, before slowly absorbing it into his body. As a result of this constant absorbance, Jian Chen was enveloped in a strange misty fog; it was the special energy that Radiant Saint Masters used. Although there were countless mercenaries nearby, some of them being Great Saint Masters, none of them had noticed Jian Chen\u2019s strange appearance.This Light Saint Force was a special type of energy that, aside from Radiant Saint Masters, no other cultivators would ever be able to perceive. Even if there was an expert at the peak of the Heaven Saint Master level, they wouldn\u2019t be able to perceive it. Because of this, Radiant Saint Masters were exceedingly rare within the Tian Yuan Continent, since every single Radiant Saint Master had to be born with this innate ability. From birth, their spirits had made special contracts with the Light Saint Force. Thus, Radiant Saint Masters were able to perceive its existence. And as their \u201cSouls\u201d grew, they would gradually be able to control the energy.When the concentration of the Light Saint Force grew to a certain degree, it would become milky white in color. At this point, a cultivator would be able to see the existence of it with their eyes. However, they would not be able to see the Light Saint Force like they would see the World Essence; the Light Saint Force would only be seen as a blank space.The night went by quickly for the caravan and its mercenaries. For the entire night, no one slept at all. If they were not trying to clean their wounds, they were trying to heighten their concentration to detect movements in their environment; no one wanted to be ambushed by the Boundless Bandits once again.Under the tense environment of the mercenaries, the night quickly passed and became day. However, the mood did not lighten at all. Although they had long since departed from their previous resting spot, they weren\u2019t safe yet. In this area, many different bandit groups could still attack them.If the mercenaries were in their prime conditions, then they would not fear any bandit group. However after the Boundless Bandits, they were all heavily injured, and had lost many of their numbers. With their current strength, if they were to come across another bandit group, then they would only be able to put up a bitter struggle.Although they knew that abandoning some of their goods would help them stay alive, the things that they were delivering were quite precious. Unless it was a last resort, neither the mercenaries nor the merchants were willing to make such a decision.As the bright, red sun rose overhead, Jian Chen, who had sat without moving for the entire night, finally opened his eyes. Jian Chen could feel a very pleasant and joyous sensation within as he stretched his limbs.After a single night of therapy, Jian Chen\u2019s body, which would have normally taken five or six days to heal from the grievous wounds, had been completely restored. Even his nearly used up Saint Force had reached a level of saturation that put Jian Chen back at the peak of his strength.Not only that, but Jian Chen could clearly tell that his Saint Force was even bigger than before.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would be able to control Light Saint Force like a Radiant Saint Master could!\u201d Jian Chen cheered internally. He was quite ecstatic to discover this, as it was a pleasant surprise to him. Equipped with this special power, his life would gain an additional source of protection. No matter how serious of an injury he would get in the future, he would be able to quickly heal it at any given place or time.While being happy at this discovery, Jian Chen was also greatly shocked at how effective the Light Saint Force was at healing. If he were to use herbal medicines, then it would have taken him four or five days to completely heal from his wounds. But using the Light Saint Force, he had been completely healed in a single night. In addition, Jian Chen had been absorbing the Light Saint Force slowly; he didn\u2019t want to speed up his absorption rate just in case it was revealed that he could do such a thing.However, Jian Chen knew that he could only use the Light Saint Force as a last resort. It was better to keep it a secret. He had considered this issue very thoroughly. There was a possibility that his ability to control Light Saint Force would raise unexpected issues during a critical moment. Although Radiant Saint Masters were highly revered in Tian Yuan Continent, this empty glory meant nothing compared to what he wanted for his life.Meanwhile, the road was relatively peaceful for the caravan. There was nothing aside from the occasional weak magical beast; they didn\u2019t come across any bandits or stronger magical beasts. With the increased traveling speed, they traveled what would have taken ten days in six, and after the third day, the caravan had finally passed the dangerous roads into a peaceful one. They were finally at the border fort of the Blue Wind Kingdom.Seeing the huge faraway walls, every single mercenary let loose a smile, as if a huge burden was lifted off their backs. Although they still had a ways to go, the usually unruly road seemed relatively peaceful., There were few cities that were scattered about Blue Wind Kingdom\u2019s vicinity. The caravan would be able to hire some new mercenaries at each of these cities to replenish their battle strength.\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the Blue Wind\u00a0Kingdom, we\u2019ve finally reached the Blue Wind Kingdom!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re safe now, we don\u2019t need to worry about the Boundless Bandits chasing us.\u201dMany of the mercenaries started to cheer out loud with joyous expressions. Even Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but smile faintly. At this moment, his heart felt lighter; after all, he was still quite weak, so if he were to leave the mercenaries and get attacked by bandits, then even he would be in dire straits.Although the massive wall could be seen in the distance, there was still five thousand meters of road. On the way, many people and caravans could be seen traveling about.The caravan finally arrived at the gates to the border fort. However, a guard soldier blocked their path.\u201cHalt, where did you all come from?\u201d He asked as his eyes swept over to look at the head merchant representative.This type of event was already prepared by the merchants, who immediately had one of the mercenaries negotiate with him. At the same time, the mercenary flashed a few glittering, golden things, and carefully placed them into the guard\u2019s outstretched palm.The guard inspected the items in his hand closely before smiling widely at him. With a wave of his hand, he said, \u201cYou may enter!\u201dAfterwards, the caravan finally passed through the giant gates of the border fort and entered the Blue Wind Kingdom.After passing through the border fort, Jian Chen immediately calmed down quite a bit. At the very least, he had escaped from the powerful grasp of the Hua Yun Sect. Although they held a formidable amount of power within the Gesun Kingdom, Jian Chen was convinced that their powers did not stretch over to the lands of the Blue Wind\u00a0Kingdom.Not too long after passing through the border fort, they came across a decently sized city. The merchants stopped to rest, and the mercenaries disbanded in order to rest. Two of them remained to guard the goods.The marketplace had allocated a place for goods to be parked, so the merchants all dropped off their items there. Since they had a few strong experts to ensure the goods were protected, the mercenaries had no need to worry about the possibility of the goods here being stolen by bandits.In actuality, no mercenary would dare rob from this place; otherwise, they would be unable to exit through any of the city gates, and would be surrounded by the city guards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After spending many days and nights constantly rushing without stop, everyone was tired. So the moment they were disbanded, they immediately headed towards the nearest inn and started to sleep. Those who were injured headed off to a place to heal their injuries.Jian Chen tied his horse to the stable area and looked around, only to see a single person wearing regular clothes standing around. After another sweeping glance, he quickly walked towards that person.Arriving behind the person, Jian Chen whispered, \u201cMu Yun, your battle skill is already known to many mercenaries. Take advantage of this opportunity, and quickly leave. Otherwise, I fear that they might try to do something to you.\u201dHearing Jian Chen, Mu Yun turned his head around and smiled at him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If they want to take my battle skill, they\u2019ll find out that it won\u2019t be that easy to do.\u201dJian Chen frowned as he looked at Mu Yun carefully, \u201cIf it\u2019s like that, then I won\u2019t speak of it anymore.\u201d He paused in thought before asking again, \u201cBut now that we\u2019ve reached the Blue Wind Kingdom, it is nearly time for me to separate from the mercenary group. From this road on, we will no longer be walking the same one. Brother Mu Yun, please take care of yourself.\u201d He cupped his hands together respectfully. Although Mu Yun and him had only just met, they were on good terms with each other. Plus, Mu Yun had revealed his secret battle skill for the sake of rescuing Jian Chen, so in his heart, Mu Yun was a decent guy. However, this wasn\u2019t enough for Jian Chen to consider him a good friend.\u201cYou take care of yourself as well!\u201d Mu Yun cupped his hands together in response.\u201cAre the two friends here preparing to leave already? Everyone is exhausted, and so we\u2019ve prepared a top rated restaurant for everyone to enjoy. It\u2019d be better to come eat and drink with everyone first.\u201d At that moment, a deep voice spoke out towards the other two. Mu Yun and Jian Chen turned around to see an older man who had a smile adorned on his face.Seeing the man, Jian Chen was a little stunned, but he quickly regained his composure. Cupping his hands in respect once more, he said, \u201cThis one greets Captain Lang Tian!\u201d Over the past few days, Jian Chen had become familiar with the three mercenary groups. The strong man wearing the black robes was Captain Lang Tian, an expert who had reached the Great Saint Master level.Seeing Captain Lang Tian, Mu Yun also cupped his hands in respect. Even with a laugh, this was still considered a respectful greeting.\u201cMy two friends, I don\u2019t know what to call you two, but when the Boundless Bandits attacked us, we honestly suffered greatly. It was thanks to you two that our casualties did not get any worse.\u201c Lang Tian smiled with a face full of benevolence.\u201cThis one is named Jian Chen. Captain Lang Tian is too generous. During the ambush with the Boundless Bandits, the one who had contributed the most was Captain Lang Tian, who had killed many of the expert bandits.\u201d\u201cYour humble servant here is called Mu Yun. What brother Jian Chen said was correct. The reason why we could successfully push back the Boundless Bandits was Captain Lang Tian. If not for the captain, then I\u2019m afraid all of our lives would have been forfeit.\u201d Mu Yun laughed.Hearing Jian Chen and Mu Yun, Lang Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a brief moment of shame before he quickly concealed it. \u201cMy friends Jian Chen and Mu Yun are too polite. Whatever the end result of the ambush was, I still have to thank you as the captain of my mercenary group. For the past few days, everyone had been so worried about the Boundless Bandits overtaking us, so we\u2019ve been spending day and night traveling as much as possible and sacrificing sleep. We\u2019ve really placed a burden on the two of you. I\u2019ve already prepared a great feast; it would be great if we were to all eat together with joyous smiles. Afterwards, we can all rest well for a few days and heal from our wounds.\u201d\u201cAlright then, after eating rations for the past few days I\u2019ve almost forgotten what meat tastes like. I was just about to prepare myself to gorge on a great meal, but since Captain Lang Tian has already prepared a feast, I can save my meal money.\u201d Mu Yun readily agreed. Facing Jian Chen, he said, \u201cBrother Jian Chen, it\u2019d be for the best if we both went. After eating rations for the past few days, you must be sick of it.\u201dJian Chen shook his head gently, \u201cI appreciate Lang Tian\u2019s kindness towards this one, but I have some important matters to attend to. I will have to leave immediately and won\u2019t be able to accompany everyone. If I have offended Captain Lang Tian, I beg for forgiveness.\u201dLang Tian looked regretful at that, but he didn\u2019t continue to try and persuade Jian Chen into staying. Cupping his hands together, he said, \u201cIf brother Jian Chen has some important matters to attend to, then this one won\u2019t hold brother up any longer from his business.\u201dAfter Jian Chen bid farewell to Lang Tian, he immediately left the area, now that he had separated from the mercenary group, he no longer had any responsibilities. If he wanted to leave, he could leave without notifying anyone.After Jian Chen had left, the black robed Lang Tian and a few other mercenaries were quietly discussing something within the room of a restaurant.\u201cCaleb, you\u2019re sure this mercenary named Mu Yun has a battle skill?\u201d Said a white robed elderly man right next to Lang Tian. He had a head of long black hair that trailed behind his head. His face was bronze in color and had many fierce looking wounds on it. Since there was still blood on some of his wounds, one could tell which wounds were new and which were old.\u201cYes, Captain Bai Fei Yun. When the mercenary called Mu Yun used his battle skill, many people around had seen it, so this information is definitely not false.\u201d Caleb replied.\u201cThat\u2019s correct, Captain Bai Fei Yun, Captain Lang Tian. Everyone that survived the ambush can testify this. What Mu Yun used was definitely a battle skill, and it was actually a highly advanced one as well.\u201d Another mercenary said.Originally this was an important manner that the mercenaries should have reported earlier. Unfortunately when they were ambushed by the Boundless Bandits, the battle skill was the last thing on their minds, since their lives were more important. Even if they were to learn the battle skill, if they weren\u2019t alive to enjoy it, it would be completely pointless in the end.Moreover, the current situation was different. Since they had entered Blue Wind\u00a0Kingdom, they were temporarily safe. Now, they could mention the battle skill that Mu Yun had.Although the mercenaries were all in the same group, life on Tian Yuan Continent was extremely cruel. Even these mercenaries would try to forcibly take an item they were jealous of, just like the Boundless Bandits had. Such circumstances happened all the time in Tian Yuan ContinentHearing these two mercenaries talk, all the other mercenaries in the room frowned.The white robed man looked at Lang Tian and said, \u201cCaptain Lang Tian, what do you think about this situation?\u201dLang Tian knit his brows together in contemplation before slowly opening his mouth, \u201cI am sure Mu Yun knows that his battle skill has been leaked to all of the mercenaries. But what I don\u2019t understand is that with his Great Saint strength, why did he not run away at the first chance he had when he knew that his battle skill was leaked? Could it be that he believes we won\u2019t make a move against him?\u201d\u201cTaking a step back, even if he trusts us, could it be that he isn\u2019t worried about us trying to force the battle skill out from him? This would bring him an endless amount of trouble, possibly to the point of losing his life.\u201d Lang Tian analyzed. Although he looked to be a straightforward person, he certainly wasn\u2019t a stupid person.\u201cSo that means either the mercenary called Mu Yun is just some mindless idiot, or he is relying on some type of support that makes him so fearless.\u201d The white robed middle aged man muttered to himself.Hearing this response, Captain Lang Tian asked, \u201cI was previously in contact with Mu Yun. In my opinion, Mu Yun isn\u2019t a mindless idiot. He\u2019s a veteran mercenary that has experience. How could someone like that commit such a fatal mistake?\u201d\u201cDoes anyone know where that Mu Yun came from?\u201d The white robed middle aged man continued.\u201cThat Mu Yun joined us midway, and is of the same occupation as us. I don\u2019t know the exact details though; after all, almost all solo mercenary planning on a long journey will join a caravan, and guarantee that the trip will go smoothly. We can\u2019t really question people like that.\u201d A middle aged man responded. He wore a long, cyan robe, and his face was slightly pale. If Jian Chen were here, he\u2019d immediately recognize that this man was the one who had agreed to let him join the caravan back in Gesun Kingdom.The mercenaries in the room all grew silent. After a while, one of the mercenaries finally couldn\u2019t hold back anymore, and said, \u201cCaptain, are we doing it or not? If we succeed in obtaining this battle skill, then we\u2019d gain quite a bit of wealth. Even if we don\u2019t use it ourselves, we can sell it. Considering how precious battle skills are in Tian Yuan Continent, we can definitely get a sky-high price for it. After all, this battle skill is of a pretty high quality.\u201d\u201cCaptain, why don\u2019t we put our all into this fight?\u201d Another mercenary said, an eager light constantly pulsing within his gaze.Captain Lang Tian frowned, however he didn\u2019t immediately reply either. Instead, he turned around to look at the white robed man next to him, and asked, \u201cCaptain Bai Fei Yun, what do you think about this situation?\u201dThe white robed middle aged man called Bai Fei Yun knit his brows. A light flashed in his eyes, and it seemed as if he was hesitant to reply.After contemplating for a while, Captain Bai Fei Yun finally said slowly, \u201cCaptain Lang Tian, I\u2019m sure that you still remember the battle we had against the experts from the Boundless Bandits a few days ago, and how at the end, a mysterious expert secretly aided us, right?\u201d He said in a serious tone.Hearing Captain Bai Fei Yun\u2019s words, the expressions of a few of the mercenaries that hadn\u2019t known the situation clearly changed. Aside from the five that had returned, nobody else knew about what had happened earlier. Originally, these mercenaries had naturally assumed that the experts from the Boundless Bandits had been killed by their own elite captains. However, it seemed that the circumstances were completely different.Captain Lang Tian was slightly moved by this, and said in a voice heavy with emotions, \u201cOf course I remember. If that mysterious expert hadn\u2019t helped from the darkness, I\u2019m afraid that we wouldn\u2019t have survived the ordeal.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

None of them could believe what they had just heard.Lang Tian continued to say, \u201cCaptain Bai Fei Yun, I am guessing that you suspect the mysterious stranger and Mu Yun are working together.\u201dBei Fei Yun nodded, \u201cIf it were not for the fact that Mu Yun had leaked his battle skill at the same time the mysterious stranger showed up, I would not have linked them together.\u201d\u2018There\u2019s logic in your words.\u201d Lang Tian said. \u201cIf Mu Yun is really working with the mysterious stranger, then we definitely cannot make a move on him. Otherwise, we would be in grave danger if we were to run into the mysterious stranger.\u201d\u201cThat mysterious stranger would definitely be able to wipe us out with ease.\u201d Bai Fei Yun said.\u201cSend the order that Mu Yun is not to be touched, and that everyone must pretend that they saw nothing.\u201d\u2026\u2026.After he bid farewell to Mu Yun, Jian Chen took a stroll in Black Wind City. While it wasn\u2019t a big city, it was close to the border fort. So for that reason, all four directions of the city were filled with the bustling traders and travellers, as well as caravans with mercenaries.After arriving not too far away from the Mercenary Union, Jian Chen walked into a nearby restaurant since it had been a long time since he had last eaten meat. He had been rushing for so many days that the taste was almost forgotten to him.After eating and drinking to his heart\u2019s content, Jian Chen was led to his room by a waiter.Sitting on the bed, Jian Chen took out some Class 1 Monster Cores in order to cultivate. Right now, Jian Chen didn\u2019t want to waste any time and cultivate slowly. He wanted to use every single monster core to help him cultivate to help him grow so strong, that even the Hua Yun Sect would be afraid of him. Then he would be able to return to his family with pride. Although he could secretly sneak back without the Hua Yun Sect noticing, Jian Chen was too prideful for that, so he wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.The energy within the monster cores was rapidly being drained away at a frightening speed and being absorbed into every single pore of his body. However Jian Chen could only absorb the 1% of the massive amount of energy, while the other 99% was absorbed into his dantian. The two glows inside his dantian were like bottomless pits that absorbed all of the energy without a single change.When it came to his dantian, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t do much since it wasn\u2019t under his control. Although the two glows within his dantian were taking up all of the energy, what made Jian Chen happy was that his absorption speed was much faster than before. Even his cultivation rate was slightly faster, which comforted Jian Chen just a bit.During the next morning, the rays of the sun shined down onto the ground as Jian Chen woke from his cultivational slumber. The Class 1 Monster Core he was holding in his hand was completely devoid of energy. He couldn\u2019t help but to laugh bitterly, \u201cThis consumption rate is too much; I\u2019ve used up 50 Class 1 Monster Core in a single night. Even if I still have a few monster cores left within the Space Ring, I\u2019ll be all out in 10 days at this rate.\u201dJian Chen got off of his bed, and moved his feet about. Afterwards, he walked up to the window and looked out at the constant stream of people walking about the main street. He murmured to himself, \u201cCultivation definitely cannot be stopped. But if I don\u2019t have any monster cores and just rely on absorbing the World Essence, the cultivation speed will only be 10% of the normal speed, and undesirable result. It looks like I\u2019ll have to think of a way to replenish my monster cores.\u201dJian Chen walked out of the room, and went to the restaurant\u2019s lower floor to look for an empty table to sit at.\u201cCustomer, what would you like to order?\u201d A cordial waiter welcomed Jian Chen with a smile as Jian Chen sat down in his seat.\u201cA plate of stir fried flower tiger meat, as well as any two side dishes. I also want a bowl of white rice.\u201d Jian Chen casually ordered a few dishes.\u201cAlright. customer, please wait for a bit.\u201dSitting at the table in boredom, Jian Chen casually looked around the restaurant. It wasn\u2019t that large, and within Black Wind City, it could only be qualified as middle sized. However, it was currently breakfast time, and quite a few merchants and mercenaries had gathered within the restaurant to eat. The majority of the 30-40 tables had been filled; only 5 remained open.The restaurant was extremely noisy, as quite a few mercenaries were speaking loudly to each other, without any consideration for those around them.\u201cCustomer, your food has arrived.\u201d Without giving much time for Jian Chen to wait, the waiter quickly brought over the dishes that Jian Chen had ordered, and carefully placed them on his table.While Jian Chen ate breakfast, he also listened in on the the idle gossip from the surrounding mercenaries. Although the restaurant was extremely chaotic, the mercenaries gathered here had all traveled extensively, and quite a bit of interesting and up-to-date matters could be learned from their words.At this moment, a few mercenaries walked into the restaurant. There was a total of five men; three of them looked like 20-30 year old youths, while the other two looked like 40 year old middle aged men. They wore the same cyan colored robes, and identical silver colored emblems in front of their chests. All of them were from the same mercenary group, and judging by their emblems, the group wasn\u2019t of a low level either.Five people entered the restaurant together. They all looked around for seats, however it was currently the peak hours, and all of the restaurants tables were already filled. There were no available spaces left.\u201cSuch bad luck, to think that there are no more seats.\u201d A slim, frail youth wearing a cyan colored robe cursed.A youth stood on one side, his gaze sweeping across the restaurant. It finally stopped on the table that Jian Chen was currently occupying by himself and he laughed, \u201cGan Hou, who said there aren\u2019t any more spots? Look, isn\u2019t that a free table right there? Even though it\u2019ll be a bit crowded if we all cram into a single table, it\u2019s not impossible.\u201dAside from Jian Chen, there were still quite a few people occupying tables alone. However, that group of people could tell the others were not people they could pick fights with. Only Jian Chen appeared to be completely powerless. Thus, the youth\u2019s attention naturally locked onto Jian Chen.The people\u2019s gazes all gathered onto the white-clad Jian Chen. After noticing that Jian Chen\u2019s appearance didn\u2019t look over 20, they smiled evilly. Afterwards, the five walked in together.Once he arrived in front of Jian Chen, the youth called \u201cGan Hou\u201d patted Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder, and said with a smile that didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes, \u201cYoung friend, this table is now occupied by us. It\u2019s better if you switch to another.\u201dJian Chen knit his brows and raised his head. His gaze swept across the expressions of the five people. Once his Soul determined that the five weren\u2019t actually that strong, his heart immediately calmed, and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I also need this table right now.\u201d Jian Chen wasn\u2019t at all afraid of the consequences. Although two of the people were quite old, their strength wasn\u2019t very significant.After all, the strength of one\u2019s power didn\u2019t solely depend on age. There were some people with outstanding talent, and had become renowned peak level experts at a young age. On the other hand, some of the more mediocre people would spend their whole lives unable to condense Spirit Weapons and overcome the threshold to becoming a Saint.Gan Hou\u2019s expression sank, and coldly stared at Jian Chen as he said, \u201cBrat, don\u2019t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. If you\u2019re wise, get out of my sight right now.\u201dTL Note: Don\u2019t hesitate do something until being forced to do it.Although Jian Chen\u2019s situation was naturally drawing the attentions of others in the restaurant, however such things happened quite often on Tian Yuan continent, and wasn\u2019t anything new. Therefore, everyone watched the situation unfold, as if watching a show, and had no intention to help out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Jian Chen was currently rather weak, that did not mean he was easily intimidated.Gingerly putting down his chopsticks, Jian Chen\u2019s lips moved slowly as he spoke, \u201cWith your paltry numbers, you don\u2019t have the right to make me move from this table.\u201dGan Hou looked stunned at this answer for a moment before sneering at Jian Chen coldly. There was a hint of undisguised killing intent within his eyes; it appeared that Jian Chen didn\u2019t know what mercy was when it was given to him, Gan Hou wouldn\u2019t mind teaching him a lesson. To Gan Hou, Jian Chen\u2019s weak appearance along with his young age made him look like someone who wasn\u2019t an expert.\u201cKid, you really don\u2019t know kindness when it\u2019s handed to you, so why don\u2019t you let brother Gan Hou teach you a lesson! Be sure to remember it!\u201d He immediately swung out with his palm towards Jian Chen\u2019s face. His palm was traveling so fast, that before it had even reached its destination, a fierce palm wind blew across Jian Chen\u2019s hair. This signified that Gan Hou\u2019s hand was not lacking in strength at all.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously as his right hand grabbed onto the chopsticks and stabbed into Gan Hou\u2019s outstretched palm.Jian Chen\u2019s right hand moved so fast that no one could see his movements. Before Gan Hou could even react, Jian Chen\u2019s right hand had already made contact with Gan Hou\u2019s palm. All people could see was Jian Chen\u2019s chopstick stabbing deeply through Gan Hou\u2019s palm, piercing through it as easily as if it were a hot metal knife cutting through butter.\u201cAh!\u201d The intense pain from his palm caused Gan Hou to cry miserably as he held his injured hand. His screams echoed throughout the restaurant, causing everyone to hear him clearly.Immediately afterwards, the restaurant was filled with gasps of shock. What happened was very different from what they were expecting, causing everyone to look at Jian Chen in surprise. However, those who were slightly more discerning saw Jian Chen use a single chopstick to stab through Gan Hou\u2019s hand, their faces became heavy and hardened. The following looks towards Jian Chen also slightly changed; quite a number of them carried deep shock.To use a flimsy wooden chopstick to stab someone\u2019s hand, just how strong did someone have to be to do that? At the very least, no one in the restaurant would be able to perform such a feat.Immediately after stabbing Gan Hou, Jian Chen\u2019s right leg lashed out and connected with Gan Hou\u2019s chest. The kick had sent Gan Hou\u2019s weak body flying back three meters before he crashed into a table and pitifully fell to the ground.The mercenaries who had been sitting at that table quickly left the area to avoid getting involved. Although Jian Chen did not seem old, the strength he demonstrated, as well as the vicious way he had dealt with things, intimidated many people in the restaurant. After this display, the few mercenaries who were eating at that table naturally didn\u2019t dare to offend Jian Chen over such a small matter.Seeing Gan Hou\u2019s end, the four other mercenaries that came with Gan Hou immediately looked on with disbelief. Although their expressions recovered afterwards, they looked at Jian Chen with eyes full of cold murderous intent.\u201cTo think you\u2019re picking a fight with the Desert Mercenaries, you must be tired of living.\u201d One of the youths shouted angrily. A giant sword appeared in his hand, and he immediately shot towards Jian Chen.Jian Chen gave a hidden smile then snorted quietly. In an instant, the silver white sword with the words \u201cLight Wind\u201d engraved on it appeared in his own hands.The Light Wind Sword was Jian Chen\u2019s sword in his previous life. During his time as a wanderer, his sword had gained a fearsome reputation that every martial artist knew of. And within this new world, he was still using an identical Light Wind Sword; Jia Chen\u2019s feelings towards his sword were very deep.The moment the Light Wind Sword appeared in Jian Chen\u2019s hands, it immediately transformed into a streak of silver lightning under Jian Chen\u2019s control, and flew at the other man at an inconceivable speed. Before the youth\u2019s sword could even get halfway towards Jian Chen\u2019s sword, it had already stabbed towards the youth\u2019s throat with a demon-like speed. The point of the sword halted right at the moment of contact on the outermost layer of thin skin at the throat, causing some blood to slowly drip down his throat for everyone to see clearly.Feeling a tinge of pain from his throat, the youth\u2019s expression became deathly pale in an instant, completely drained of blood. Sweat began to gather, covering his whole forehead in the blink of eye. He made a great effort to keep the greatsword in his hand frozen in midair. His body was locked into a firm posture, as he didn\u2019t dare to move even a single inch. The youth\u2019s appearance looked as if a mysterious force was keeping him locked in place.Seeing how nobody knew when the silver sword had appeared at the youth\u2019s throat, the clamor around them had descended into a strange silence. Everyone\u2019s eyes went wide as they looked at Jian Chen wield his Light Wind Sword; no one could believe what had just happened.In regards to how the sword arrived at the youth\u2019s throat, only two or three people in the restaurant had caught a glimpse of the sword traveling through the air. Most of the people there weren\u2019t even able to see the flash of silver, and only saw the point of the blade appear before the youth\u2019s throat.It was as if time had stood still as everyone held their breaths. After a while, the sounds of everyone inhaling cold breaths could be heard breaking the silence of the restaurant. At that moment, everyone was looking at Jian Chen with expressions of surprise.As for the youth who was being held at swordpoint, he didn\u2019t dare move. His fear was that if he were to move, the sword would pierce into his throat.\u201cMy fellow brother, please stay your hand. We are part of the Desert Mercenaries, and this was our fault. I hope that you\u2019ll let our companion go.\u201d A middle aged man spoke with some moderation and showed a face full of sincerity.Hearing this, Jian Chen\u2019s gaze shifted towards the middle age man who spoke. After a brief moment of hesitation, he slowly lowered the Light Wind Sword in his hand and said to the youth, \u201cScram!\u201dHearing Jian Chen, the youth that was held at swordpoint glared at him with an indignant expression for a brief second. But owing to the fact that he just escaped a disaster, he didn\u2019t dare to say a single word.The Light Wind Sword disappeared from Jian Chen\u2019s hands as his gaze coldly swept across them. He then pulled out a single gold coin and placed it at the table. \u201cWaiter, this is for the meal!\u201d He stated flatly before exiting from the restaurant.After such an event, Jian Chen didn\u2019t wish to stay there any longer. Since he had already eaten and drank, he was content.Afterwards, the youth that was released by Jian Chen, he glared at Jian Chen with murderous intent. Glancing at his three other companions with a knowing look, they all nodded at the same time. Following this, the four of them acted in unison, as if they had long since prepared for this to happen. They all summoned their Saint Weapons and immediately charged at Jian Chen from different positions, aiming towards several vital parts on Jian Chen\u2019s body at the same time.Hearing the sounds of activity happening behind him, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes narrowed as he started to leak an intense killing intent from within his eyes. Swaying slightly, his body had already flashed forwards two meters with an extreme speed just as the weapons slashed at where his back was just moments ago, causing them to just narrowly miss him. Using sheer skill, he had managed to escape the encirclement. At that moment, Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword materialized in his right hand once more as Jian Chen immediately turned around to face the four men. With just a single step he closed the gap between himself, and the four people. His right arm abruptly shook, and his Light Wind Sword stabbed at the closest middle aged man with an insane speed.Just like a silver streak of lightning, the Light Wind Sword had already closed in on the middle aged man, stabbing towards his throat.The middle aged man wasn\u2019t weak at all and was much stronger than the first youth. The moment he saw Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword stabbing towards him, the middle aged man\u2019s face immediately hardened, before bringing back his sword that he already slashed outwards to replace it protectively across his neck.\u201cTing!\u201dJust as the middle aged man finished this movement, the Light Wind Sword\u2019s tip pierced the flat side of his sword, causing a metallic sound to ring out. A small, shallow mark appeared on the flat side of his blade.Seeing how his sword was blocked, Jian Chen sneered, and his eyes flashed once more. The next moment, the Light Wind Sword had a hazy glow burst out from the blade. It did not look very strong, but it was actually concealing its sharpness. No one from the restaurant could detect that hidden power however, and when Jian Chen stamped forward, he simultaneously twisted his body in midair to form a horizontal rotating line. His Light Wind Sword began to rotate at high speeds as well, before flying forward with Sword Qi adding to its power.\u201cHisssss!\u201dAn unpleasant sound echoed throughout the restaurant as the Light Wind Sword began to rotate at a lightning quick speed. That violently strong penetrating power bore a two finger wide hole through the man\u2019s sword like a hot knife through butter, leaving behind a deep cavity through the sword. Entering through the cavity and under the disbelieving gaze of the middle aged man, Jian Chen\u2019s sword pierced deeply into his throat.Jian Chen landed gracefully on his toes as he pulled out his sword from the throat of the middle aged man. Without stopping, he moved towards the other three before they could react, and with another silver flash of his sword, he stabbed at the youth who had originally attacked him.\u201cAi!\u201dAgainst the extremely fast movements of Jian Chen\u2019s sword, the first youth was far too weak to do anything to resist. Before he could even react, the Light Wind Sword had already pierced through his neck, spilling blood everywhere.Before anyone could even take a breath, Jian Chen had already killed two people with extreme haste. This type of speed was absolutely unimaginable to everyone watching.Even after killing two people, Jian Chen showed no change in emotions. Instead, he stared at the remaining two people and his sword abruptly shook again. But as he was about to set forward to kill the two, unimaginably, they immediately recalled their Saint Weapons. They began to kowtow onto the ground while crying out loudly, \u201cSpare our lives oh, great, swordsman. Spare our lives! We beg of you to spare us, we will never bare our weapons towards you ever again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not long after, their expressions changed to a \u2018just as expected\u2019 attitude. There were all sorts of people in Tian Yuan Continent; some would rather lose their lives than to bow their heads and admit their errors. Others only clung onto their lives and were scared of death. These people would sooner sell off their brothers, and even their friends, when their lives were threatened.Jian Chen slowly lowered his sword; the point of the sword now faced the ground. Staring coldly at the two people begging for their lives, Jian Chen\u2019s brows furrowed as he gazed at the two with contempt. When it came to people who were afraid of death like this, he was disgusted by them.Upon seeing Jian Chen lower his sword, the two mercenaries that were kowtowing really thought that he was letting them go, and they smiled in relief. But before they could be happy for too long, a single phrase made the smiles on their faces go rigid.\u201cI had already let you go before, but it\u2019s a shame that you didn\u2019t cherish it. The time for forgiveness is over.\u201d A cold and indifferent voice came from Jian Chen\u2019s mouth. Just as he finished talking, his right hand burst into motion, appearing like a hazy shadow. Immediately sweeping forward with an extreme speed, the Light Wind Sword transformed into a silver streak, stabbing the two people.The Light Wind Sword moved so fast that the two people didn\u2019t even get a chance to react. Slashing gently across their necks, small lacerations could be seen, and large amounts of blood began to pour out, dying their necks red.If the two mercenaries had wanted to resist while Jian Chen wished to kill them, he would have had to expend a little more effort, and they could possibly have even escaped from Jian Chen if their luck was good. Unfortunately, they had already been intimidated by Jian Chen\u2019s might, which had been demonstrated when he killed their two companions with a lightning fast speed. This blew away any notions of running away or resisting, making it easier for Jian Chen to kill them.After effortlessly killing the two, Jian Chen turned around to look at the last terrified mercenary. Like a shining beam of light, the Light Wind Sword slashed at his neck as well.The five members of the Desert Mercenaries had all been killed by Jian Chen before anyone could breathe more than a dozen times.Jian Chen didn\u2019t react at all to the five deaths; instead he pulled out a few gold coins from his Space Belt and placed them on the table. \u201cThese gold coins are for you to clean up this place.\u201d With that, Jian Chen left the restaurant unhurriedly.The Tian Yuan Continent was a cruel place where disputes and murders ran rampant. So murder was a common thing that everyone was used to. Even though a murder had happened within the restaurant, the other customers wouldn\u2019t care. As long as they weren\u2019t involved, they would treat it as a good show to watch, without it having any affect on their appetites.The other customers watched Jian Chen leave and the entire restaurant descended into an odd silence. At this point, every person had forgotten about their food and just stared blankly at Jian Chen, and then back at the five dead mercenaries. They didn\u2019t believe what had just happened in this restaurant.For a while, the odd silence permeated the restaurant before a loud sigh of admiration could be heard\u2013\u201cWhat a fast sword, they couldn\u2019t even react to it. And what precise control he had! I\u2019ve traveled the Tian Yuan Continent for many years and never have I ever seen anything like that!\u201dA middle aged man wearing blue robes said. He was one of the few that could catch a glimpse of Jian Chen\u2019s movements.\u201cThat man looked to be quite young, yet quite strong. His movements were also vicious, and each blow was a fatal one. If he isn\u2019t from a major clan, then he must have an excellent master backing him up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what his name is, but with his strength, it\u2019d be nice if he could join my mercenary group. If he does, then my group\u2019s strength would increase.\u201d A male said.Another male youth spoke out in reply to him, \u201cDon\u2019t even dream about it; he looks much younger than you, yet he has this much strength. These kinds of people would not have a simple background. We are just a small mercenary group that has no chance of attracting such an expert. Not only that, he just killed five mercenaries from the Desert Mercenaries; their group won\u2019t take this offense lying down. So even if we were to be able to bring him into our group as a member, it is quite possible that we\u2019d also attract huge trouble. After all, we\u2019re still an extremely tiny and weak group in comparison to the strong, thousand man Desert Mercenaries.\u201d\u2026\u2026After leaving the restaurant, Jian Chen arrived at the Mercenary Union in order to find a mission to protect some caravans. Since they were all going to cities that were close by, Jian Chen could take these missions despite his low mercenary level.Wake City was a third class city, but despite its ranking, the city walls were on par with a first class. This was because the nearby mountain range was filled with many strong magical beasts. Those magical beasts would often raid the city with an all out frontal assault, so while Wake City wasn\u2019t very large and could only be considered third class, the citizens had constructed an extraordinarily strong and secure wall to protect themselves from the magical beasts.In the afternoon, the fierce sun started to release a strong glow, and that intense illumination prevented everyone from lifting their heads. Many of the mercenaries on the road had started to squint to prevent their eyes from being hurt by the sun\u2019s rays.Outside of Wake City, a caravan group of two or three hundred people slowly trekked towards the city gates.\u201cThe weather can go and die, why is it so hot? How can people survive this weather?\u201dWithin the caravan group, a ** year old cursed out loud. Grabbing his water canteen, he ruthlessly chugged away at it.Not too far away from the thirsty man, a youth with simple clothing sat on top of a white horse with a serene face, looking as if he were sleeping.The youth was rather ordinary looking, and had a very common appearance. From his looks, he seemed to be around twenty years old or so.Despite the fact that the scorching sun was currently high in the sky, this youth was tightly wrapped in clothes. The material wasn\u2019t very thick, but a normal person still wouldn\u2019t be able to take the heat in such a state. The most astounding fact was that there was not a single drop of sweat on the youth\u2019s forehead.Compared to the mercenaries and merchants in the caravan that had either naked torsos or were sweating furiously, this youth\u2019s appearance was clearly strange. Although quite a few of the mercenaries and merchants had cast peculiar looks towards the youth, they didn\u2019t attempt to strike a conversation with him.This youth was Jian Chen.Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes and indifferently looked at the large city wall in front of him. During the past 2 days on the road, he had followed the caravan and finally arrived at Wake City. Jian Chen had specially chosen Wake City as it was a good place for himself to stay; he planned on living in Wake City for a period of time. That way, he\u2019d be able to diligently improve his strength by a whole new level with the help of monster cores from the nearby Magical Beast Mountain Range.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With this, he was able to earn a bit of reputation and a small amount of money.Because Wake City was so close to the Magical Beast Mountain Range, the number of mercenaries that stopped to rest here were much greater than any other city. The majority of the mercenaries had their eyes set on the favorable living conditions here, and tended to stay around for a long term period. It was extremely convenient to enter the Magical Beast Mountain Range and hunt magical beasts in exchange for money.Although the dangerous factor of hunting magical beasts was much greater than escorting caravans, it was also an extremely profitable task. There were many people who lost their lives to magical beasts daily. But because the monster cores had such great value and were in high demand, many mercenaries were willing to risk their lives for the profits gained from hunting magical beasts.After all, monster cores were simply too precious in Tian Yuan Continent. Since almost everyone needed them, the amount they required was quite large. After gaining monster cores, they could directly absorb the energies within them to quicken their cultivation rate. In addition, even if one didn\u2019t personally use them, one could easily exchange the cores for a considerable amount of money.The mercenary union was extremely noisy due to there being many mercenaries inside. A union as large as this was filled with hundreds of people. The majority of the men had naked torsos, and their robust builds could clearly be seen from their bare muscles. It seemed as if they displayed their bodies to demonstrate how powerful they were.Under such blistering hot temperatures as well as the poor ventilation system within the union, the sour odor of sweat pervaded the air and assaulted the nose. It made Jian Chen, who very rarely experienced this type of odor, knit his brow, and use a hand to lightly pinch his own nose.After leaving the mercenary union, Jian Chen went around the city to replenish his supplies. He bought a map of the Magical Beast Mountain Range, and then headed straight out of Wake City. Under the scorching sun, he advanced forward alone to the Magical Beast Mountain Range.The Magical Beast Mountain Range was only about 30 kilometers away from Wake City. After rushing towards the mountains on horseback, Jian Chen finally arrived at the edge of the Magical Beast Mountain Range two hours later.A stretch of forest bordered the edges of the Magical Beast Mountain Range and deep inside the forest was a large mountain range. Within the mountain range were numerous magical beastsThe environment inside was vile as well, and according to the description of the Magical Beast Mountain Range from the map, there were countless poisonous vipers and insects within the forest. Not only that, swamps could also be found all over, and if a person were not careful, they could sink into one. Without the help of a companion, it would be extremely difficult to escape with their life.The proverbs once said that fortune and danger live together. So while the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts had many dangers, at the same time, there was also treasure to be found. The Magical Beasts frequently fought each other, so upon their deaths, their monster cores would be preserved. If one had good luck, then they would be able to come across a few magical beast corpses that still had their cores, and collect them, but the chances of that happening were still rather low.Monster cores could be used by the magical beasts as well, but the lowest rank of magical beasts didn\u2019t know if or how it could be used and only operated on instinct.Jian Chen sat on his horse with his head facing the verdant forest in front of him. \u201cFrom today on out, this forest will be my training ground where I shall gain some experience.\u201d Dismounting, he stroked the horse gently on its head and without caring if the horse, that had accompanied him for quite a number of days, could understand him he said, \u201cGo on, you\u2019re free now, go wherever you want to go.\u201d Afterwards, Jian Chen turned around and headed towards the forest within.\u201cNeigh!\u201dThe horse behind him stamped on the ground firmly as it looked at Jian Chen as it was saying goodbye.\u2026\u2026After covering a stretch of road, Jian Chen finally entered the depths of the forest, and without stopping, continued on his path towards the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts.The forest had weeds everywhere that reached the height of a regular person, completely blocking his vision. In this type of environment, one could lose their way if they weren\u2019t careful.Every few steps Jian Chen would jump onto a huge tree to view the surrounding routes around him to ensure that he hadn\u2019t lost his path, allowing him to keep track of where he was. Every so often, he would find a viper hidden in between the blades of grass, but with his \u201cSoul\u201d, he could easily perceive it and take care of the vipers whenever they appeared.After traveling for 4 hours, Jian Chen finally entered the depths of the forest, where ferocious beasts were beginning to gradually appear.At that instant, a dark green figure leapt out from the weeds, and attempted to attack Jian Chen from behind with extreme speed.Just as the dark green figure approached Jian Chen, a white light flashed past, and a silver sword suddenly appeared. It accurately pierced into the green figure\u2019s concealed body with unmatched quickness.The moment after the sword made contact, Jian Chen\u2019s body swayed, and he shifted half a meter to the side. The moment he moved away, a soft \u2018bang\u2019 could be heard as the dark green figure fell at where Jian Chen had just been standing.Only now was he able to clearly see that the dark green figure was a beast that looked similar to a leopard. Its neck was already soaked with blood that continuously poured out from its deep wound.Jian Chen\u2019s gaze swept across the leopard-type beast lying on the ground. He then continued to advance into the forest. He could tell from a single glance that the beast was only a normal wild animal; it wasn\u2019t even a Class 1 Magical Beast. There were absolutely no monster core that could be retrieved from within its body; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill it so easily.\u201cRoar!\u201d\u201cAooo!\u201dAs Jian Chen continued to travel deeper into the forest, the howls of magical beasts gradually started to fill the air. There were many different types of cries; some were unpleasant as they sounded like the wails of malicious spirits that made anyone hearing it feel terrified.At that moment, Jian Chen suddenly stopped in his tracks. He turned around, and his eyes flashed with a serious light as he stared towards his side. The silver Light Wind Sword materialized in his hand.This was the first time Jian Chen displayed such a serious expression since he first entered the forest.A faint \u2018sha sha\u2019 sound emitted from the location Jian Chen was looking towards. Shortly after, a dusty yellow scorpion slowly appeared within Jian Chen\u2019s line of sight.The scorpion was extremely large. Its body alone was a meter wide, and two meters long. A poisonous stinger hung from the end of its tail, which was at least 5-6 meters long. Right on its head, a pair of jade, beady eyes started to flicker with a strange glow.The scorpion headed straight towards Jian Chen. Only after it was 5 meters away from Jian Chen did it stop its advance. Its bright eyes flashed with a strange glint as it locked its gaze onto Jian Chen,brandishing its pincers at Jian Chen as a \u201czhi zhi\u201d sound came from its mouth.The silver Light Wind Sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hand was enveloped in a hazy glow. Immediately, he attacked first and his body blurred as he shot towards the scorpion with his blade.His original intent in coming here was to kill magical beasts, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t hold back after encountering one.The scorpion\u2019s reaction was quick; as soon as Jian Chen began to move, the poisonous stinger at the end of its tail blurred, and rapidly darted at Jian Chen.\u201cDing!\u201dJian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword simultaneously shot out towards the scorpion\u2019s poisonous hook. As the two made contact in midair, a clear sound that was similar to metal striking metal rang out. The collision generated a powerful aftershock that caused both Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword and the scorpion\u2019s hook to recoil backwards.With only a slight sway of his body, Jian Chen had already retreated back quite a few meters. He looked at the poisonous stinger of the large scorpion in shock. The hardness of it had surpassed his expectations. Jian Chen reckoned that even a superior type steel could not compare to this scorpion\u2019s stinger. Moreover, the power that it contained was immense. After a single collision with it just now, Jian Chen\u2019s arm had already begun to feel numb.\u201cThe scorpion in front of me should be a Class 2 Magical Beast.\u201d Jian Chen muttered to himself as he fixed his bright eyes on the scorpion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Class 2 Magical Beasts in Kargath Academy were not even equivalent to some of the Class 1 Magical Beasts in this mountain range. Moreover, the magical beast that he had encountered was one indigenous to the Magical Beast Mountain Range.Just as Jian Chen was distracted, the poisonous scorpion didn\u2019t give him any time to relax, as its six powerful legs began to scamper across the floor. In a blink of an eye it covered dozens of metres and arrived in front of Jian Chen as its poisonous green pincers widened menacingly and pincered towards Jian Chen\u2019s head.Encountering a local magical beast for the first time in the mountain range, Jian Chen did not dare to be negligent. He had learned the hard way in his previous life that being careless only led to disaster.Jian Chen\u2019s expression immediately grew solemn. He tilted his head, dodging the giant scorpion\u2019s pincers by a hair\u2019s breath. He then gathered strength in his feet and pushed off the ground, leaving a deep footprint in the ground as his body burst forwards towards the poisonous scorpion\u2019s much smaller head. The Light Wind Sword in his hand was once again enshrouded in that hazy white light as Jian Chen aimed it straight at the scorpion\u2019s tiny eyes.The eyes, throat and heart were three of the most fatal and weakest parts of the body. That much Jian Chen understood, but this poisonous scorpion had a neck that could not easily be pierced due to the angle. Not only was the neck rather short, but it had scales that were interwoven with each other to protect it. Under this circumstance where it was impossible to determine how tough the scales protecting its neck were, Jian Chen had decided to attack its eyes.Although Jian Chen was very confident in his precise and powerful stab, the defenses of some magical beasts were also just as tough. Thus, he wasn\u2019t 100% sure that he would be able to penetrate the scales and deal a serious injury to the beast.Jian Chen\u2019s sword traveled towards the scorpion with blinding speed, his sword had already reached the scorpion\u2019s eye.Just as the Sword Qi enhanced Light Wind Sword as he was about to pierce the scorpion\u2019s eye, it suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a pungent green blob of poison. Almost as if it were being controlled by a mysterious force, it flew quickly towards Jian Chen. At the same time, the scorpion\u2019s eye shut and the head dodged towards the side, avoiding the Light Wind Sword.The Light Wind Sword\u2019s speed was matchless, and so even at this crucial moment where the scorpion desperately tried to dodge, the scorpion wasn\u2019t able to completely avoid the sword. In the end, the sword slashed open the scorpion\u2019s outer eyelid.While the Light Wind Sword hit the scorpion\u2019s outer eyelid and it paused for a bit as it encountered resistance. After a moment, the amazing amount of Sword Qi around the sword caused it to break through the strong defenses of the eyelid and stab through into the eye of the scorpion successfully.Simultaneously, Jian Chen\u2019s entire body was covered by the green fog of poison.\u201cHiss!\u201dAs it felt the sharp pain in its eye, the scorpion let loose a hoarse scream. A dark green fluid began to leak out of the injury in its eye, and its great mouth opened wide, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth. Its overall appearance was extremely terrifying.The poisonous mist floated around. Jian Chen, who was shrouded inside the fog, retreated outwards, in a sorry state, as fast as lightning to escape. Right now, Jian Chen\u2019s appearance was the complete opposite of his previous state; his whole body was covered with a layer of dark green poison. His coarse clothing had begun to disintegrate at an alarming rate, and even his originally short hair had begun to fall off as green threads.Feeling a painful burning sensation throughout his body, Jian Chen\u2019s face hardened before growling, \u201cWhat a strong poison!\u201d Quickly, Jian Chen grabbed onto the melting clothes before tearing them off from his body while using his Saint Force to counter the poison that made contact with his skin.Jian Chen looked at the one eyed scorpion that was still crying out in pain. He knew in his heart that this was the perfect time to kill the scorpion. With a flash of killing intent, he dashed towards it without even stopping to take out a spare change of clothes from within his Space Ring, making him completely naked while moving to finish off the scorpion.Jian Chen\u2019s movements were agile and nimble, and he quickly flashed to the poisonous scorpion\u2019s side. With a shake of his arm, he reached out as fast as lightning, moving the Light Wind Sword in his hand so fast it appeared to be just a ray of silver light. It shot towards the scorpion\u2019s throat, and in that instant, the blade suddenly exploded with sharp Sword Qi. Although it didn\u2019t seem to be very powerful, that Sword Qi was similar to a sharp blade.Like a streak of lightning that briefly illuminated the world with a gorgeous and magnificent light, and it immediately disappeared without a trace momentarily afterwards.\u201cDing!\u201dJian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword accurately struck the poisonous scorpion\u2019s throat. When the blade came into contact with the dense scales covering the scorpion\u2019s throat, a clear sound similar to metal striking metal rang out. However, the scales\u2019 defense was quite strong, it was only able to withstand the Light Wind Sword for an instant before the blade sharpened with Sword Qi broke through, and pierced deeply into the throat.\u201cSi!\u201dThe poisonous scorpion once again cried out miserably. The single, intact eye pulsed with a strange, dark green glint as its thick pincers quickly jabbed forcefully outwards towards Jian Chen. The 5-6 meter long poisonous hook behind it blurred as it flew over Jian Chen\u2019s head and tried to pierce the back of Jian Chen\u2019s head.Jian Chen pulled out the Light Wind Sword buried in the scorpion\u2019s throat. His feet pushed off the ground, and his body sailed through the air as he jumped onto the scorpion\u2019s wide back.\u201cHiss!\u201d \u201cHiss!\u201dThe poisonous scorpion was evidently extremely annoyed by the fact that Jian Chen had jumped onto its back. It began to violently shake its body, wailing unpleasantly as it recklessly waved its giant pincers around in the air.Based on the scorpion\u2019s current state, it appeared that the injury on its throat that Jian Chen had just inflicted didn\u2019t harm it that much.Seeing that the scorpion was still as ferocious as it was before, Jian Chen frowned. He couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cIts ability to stay alive is really too great, to think that it still hasn\u2019t died.\u201d Because the scorpion\u2019s body was so massive, Jian Chen once again realized how limited his strength was. Aside from attacking the two vital region of its eyes and throat, he couldn\u2019t find any other way to harm this scorpion.At that moment, Jian Chen heard a faint ripping sound. Without any hesitation, Jian Chen flashed horizontally to the side.Just as Jian Chen dodged to the side, the shining dark green poisonous hook flew over his head, and then ruthlessly pierced the scorpion\u2019s own back.A soft sound could be heard as the strong, plated section of its outer shell was pierced through by its own sharp poisonous hook. Under its own sharp poisonous hook, its shell did not offer a whit of resistance , and was easily pierced through. The sharp hook buried itself deeply into the scorpion\u2019s own body, and dark green blood began to flow out from the wound.Seeing this scene, Jian Chen\u2019s expression clearly went blank. However, immediately afterwards, he couldn\u2019t help but feel unsure of whether to laugh or cry. He had really never imagined that the poisonous scorpion would be stupid enough to actually hurt itself.The scorpion tugged at its poisonous hook. But because it was already deeply buried within its body, its movements instantly pulled out a chunk of flesh as well. The scorpion felt such intense pain that it ceaselessly wailed in pain as its entire body shook. That fierce pain was enough to disperse any further thoughts about pulling the hook out.Whenever a human or creature receives a serious injury, there will be a cushion of time where the strength that they exhibit, as well as their reaction speed, will be at its worst.Jian Chen saw this, and grasping the perfect timing, his body flew high up into the air as he jumped off the scorpion\u2019s back. The Light Wind Sword in his hand flashed with a silver light, and pierced towards the scorpion\u2019s other eye.Because the scorpion was feeling fierce pain from its back, its reaction time had greatly slowed down compared to its normal reaction speed. In addition, Jian Chen\u2019s blade\u2019s every movement was incomparably fast. In the scorpion\u2019s current state, it was extremely difficult to evade or withstand Jian Chen\u2019s lightning fast sword.The Light Wind Sword accurately penetrated the poisonous scorpion\u2019s other eye without resistance.Jian Chen showed a pleased expression. He exerted more strength into his hand, forcing the Light Sword even deeper into the scorpion\u2019s eyes. Eventually, after thrusting at least half of the 4/3 meter long blade into the scorpion\u2019s eyes, he finally managed to injure its brain.This time, the poisonous scorpion no longer struggled or made any move to resist. Its entire body shuddered a few times before it fell like jello to the ground. With a loud bang, its enormous one meter tall body fell to the ground.Jian Chen slowly pulled out his Light Wind Sword. His brows knit together at the sight of the scorpion\u2019s bright green blood and white fluid covering his treasured sword. With a single thought, the green and white fluids covering his sword slid off the blade, and it instantly returned to its original appearance.Jian Chen\u2019s gaze circled around the poisonous scorpion corpse for a bit, then raised his Light Wind Sword to pierce through the skull. However, the Light Wind Sword had just gone through the outer shell of the head before getting blocked. Even though the poisonous scorpion was already dead, its outer shell\u2019s defense was still just as strong as before. There was no way Jian Chen could break through its defense with a casual wave of his sword.\u201cThis snake skin is really thick!\u201d Jian Chen furrowed his brows, and sighed, \u201cForget it, I might as well conserve my energy. The magical beasts here come and go randomly. If I preserve my extra strength, then that is an extra layer of protection for my life. I\u2019ll just retrieve this monster cores by going through its eyes.\u201d Saying this, Jian Chen resumed his actions. After great effort, he was finally able to retrieve the monster core stored within the scorpion\u2019s skull.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not only that, this Class 2 Monster Core is much better than the ones I found at Kargath Academy. It really is true that the magical beasts in the Magical Beast Mountain Range are stronger than the ones in the Kargath forests.\u201dAfter collecting the monster core, Jian Chen lowered his head to look at his body that was now dark shade of green. However, his body wasn\u2019t injured at all. Since he had been refining his body since he was young with the special techniques from Azulet Sword Law, his physique was really strong. So even though the poison caused his body to feel some pain, it couldn\u2019t get past his skin and enter his body. The majority of the damage was being counteracted with his inner Saint Force. So while his entire body was tainted with a green poison, the only symptom he felt was a slight burning sensation.Jian Chen looked around himself and listened attentively, \u201cThere probably isn\u2019t a water source here, so I won\u2019t be able to to wash this off. I guess I\u2019ll have to handle this roughly.\u201d Plucking a few tree leaves, he began to wipe off the excess venom while pulling out a new change of clothing from within his Space Belt. Although this place was extremely large and there wasn\u2019t be anyone around, Jian Chen had no hobby of walking around naked.After changing his clothes, Jian Chen walked away from where the carcass of the scorpion lay without a care at all for it. Although magical beasts had many important parts that could be harvested and sold off for a high price, this scorpion was just a Class 2 Magical Beast. If he were to sell this, he wouldn\u2019t be getting much since it wasn\u2019t a precious type of material, plus, Jian Chen had plenty of Purple Coins to spare, so the him today did not care for such a little sum of money.While the beasts that were born and grew in the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts were much more powerful than those in Kargath Forest, they were much rarer than the ones in Kargath Forest. After all, while the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts may not be the largest in the Tian Yuan Continent, it was still vast in its own right. The magical beasts in the mountain range were all scattered about, so meeting a magical beast was not impossible, but rather quite rare.For the entire day Jian Chen slowly walked deeper into the mountain range. By nighttime, he had only seen two magical beasts, excluding the previous Class 2 Poisonous Scorpion, these two were both Class 1 Magical Beasts.The moon was hanging high up in the sky and basked the earth with its lunar glow. However it did not reach into the forest where darkness reigned supreme, so one couldn\u2019t even see their fingers if they stretched out their hand in front of their faces. With the abundant amount of leaves covering the forest, the weak lunar lights wouldn\u2019t be able to penetrate through onto the ground below.Meanwhile on a flat piece of ground, a large bonfire burst into life and lit up the night with its dancing flames.Jian Chen knelt by the bonfire with a stick in his hand as he slowly cooked a piece of meat that was speared through. Slowly, the meat began to caramelize as the fat began to slowly drip off onto the fire below, sputtering it out.After eating his fill, Jian Chen pulled out a unique smelling herb from his Space Ring and sprinkled it on the surroundings. This herb was one of the few things that every mercenary entering the forest would need to prepare. Before resting, if one were to sprinkle this herb in his surroundings, it would be able to repel the majority of poisonous creatures from disturbing him. Of course, this medicine was only useful towards normal animals, and had no effect on magical beasts.After using the herb, Jian Chen immediately leapt onto a nearby tree. Sitting cross legged on a slightly flatter branch, Jian Chen took out another faintly sweet smelling herb from within his Space Ring and started to sprinkle it on his body. This white colored herb was very effective in suppressing one\u2019s Qi, preventing his qi from escaping which might attract any kind of wild beasts while he was sleeping at night. After all, both the wild animals and the magical beasts in this mountain range had extremely acute senses of smell. Although this powder wouldn\u2019t be able to completely hide Jian Chen\u2019s Qi, it could at least conceal it from the senses of normal animals.The mountain range had many magical beasts as well as wild animals. The reason why wild animals were called so was because they had no monster core within their bodies. Wild animals were also not as strong as a Class 1 Magical Beast, similar to humans that hadn\u2019t yet manifested their Saint weapons.Although the wild animals weren\u2019t strong and anyone who dared to enter the Mountain Range of Mystical Beasts could easily kill them, when it came to cultivating or sleeping at night, no one would want to be bothered by a wild animal. Therefore, practically every mercenary who entered the mountain range or slept outdoors overnight would be prepared, and bring a good amount of this type of herb.After the safety preparations were complete, Jian Chen took out a big handful of monster cores and distributed them between his two hands. Jian Chen slowly closed his eyes and began to absorb the energy from the monster cores.The energy from the monster cores started to flow out at an extremely terrifying speed towards Jian Chen, before funneling into his body via his pores and nostrils crazily. This absorption rate naturally placed a slight burden on Jian Chen, causing his pores to feel a slight ache from expanding. Throughout his entire body, there was no area that did not hurt.Although it was aching a little, this was not enough for Jian Chen, who had a strong willpower, to mind it much.The energy of the monster cores had a berserk element to it. If it weren\u2019t for Jian Chen using the World Essence to strengthen his body since he was young which meant that his internal organs and his fundamentals were made to be a lot stronger than most others, he would have been heavily injured alone by the berserk element contained within the energy of the cores, nevermind the fact that he was absorbing the energy into his body so crazily.Following the absorption of the large amount of energy, the berserk element accumulated inside Jian Chen\u2019s body. When the berserk element reached a certain point, a large absorption power started to surge from Jian Chen\u2019s dantian, pulling these elements continuously towards the dantian, before finally being absorbed by the two glows of azure and violet.On Tian Yuan Continent, if a practitioner wanted to rely on the monster cores to cultivate, then they would need to clear away the berserk element within the energy and absorb the pure energy remaining. Just removing that element from the energy would take a lot of time, and even then, the berserk element wouldn\u2019t be completely removed, and would leave behind some harmful effects within the body. So while there were many people who relied on using monster cores to cultivate, not many would continue down that path. Every so often, a person would need to stop using monster cores and completely refine the energy absorbed, in order to not suffer from any negative effects.Though with Jian Chen, he could absorb and refine the energy from the monster core without fear of the consequences which was possibly due to the glows within his dantian. The moment the energy entered his body, the berserk element would immediately be absorbed by them. allowing for Jian Chen to absorb the energy from the monster cores without fear. This was why Jian Chen had such a large advantage over the other cultivators.Following the steady absorption of the monster cores, Jian Chen could clearly feel the Saint Force slowly growing larger and larger in his dantian. Although it might look slow to the naked eye, Jian Chen understood that this speed compared to others was really fast. At this rate, it would not be long until he would breakthrough to become a Great Saint.On the second day, when the sunlight passed through the small chinks between the dense tree leaves, Jian Chen, who was sitting cross-legged and cultivating, slowly opened his eyes. He then flipped in the air, jumping down from the tree, and smoothly landed on the ground below.Jian Chen stretched his body for a bit. After consciously feeling his inner Saint Force, he couldn\u2019t help but smile. He could clearly sense that his current Saint Force was much more powerful than when he had first condensed his Saint Weapon. Based on his calculations, his current strength was most likely already at the level of a Middle Saint.Although he was only a Middle Saint, it had been less than a month since Jian Chen had first condensed his Saint Weapon and broken through to Sainthood. If anyone else heard that Jian Chen had managed to become a Middle Saint only less than a month after, they would definitely find it hard to believe.After eating some food to fill his stomach, Jian Chen once again continued on his journey.\u2026\u2026.Time quickly passed by. In the blink of an eye, a month had already passed. at the foot of the Magical Beast Mountain Range, a youth wearing a coarse set of clothing was currently facing a pitch-black, panther-type magical beast that was a meter tall and three meters long.The youth held a long, thin, silver sword. He stood tall and straight, seeming to be as immovable as a mountain. His face was brightly colored by mud and dust, making it impossible to make out any of his facial features.The panther-type magical beast was glaring at the youth opposite of it with a ferocious glint in its eyes. It roared deeply, and began to fall into a crouching position. Its hind legs firmly planted into the ground, preparing to attack at any moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It leapt into the air with such force that its pawprint was visibly imprinted on the ground, as its entirely black body transformed into a black shadow that shot towards the youth ten meters away. While in midair, the black panther began to open its large jaw that revealed its sharp teeth that could fill a person\u2019s heart with dread.The youth smiled coldly as the silver white sword within his hand started to emit a faint white glow. With a single slash, the sword tip flew towards the black panther\u2019s opened mouth.The sword was traveling extremely fast, just like a flash of lightning. However, the black panther\u2019s reaction was very fast, so when the sword reached its jaws, the black panther tilted its head to the side, barely dodging the incoming attack. However the sword was still traveling too fast to be evaded completely, so it grazed its head. It left a very noticeable wound on the black panther\u2019s shaggy head.. However, the black panther\u2019s speed did not slow down at all; maintaining its previous speed, it shot towards the youth in front of it.The corners of the youth\u2019s mouth tilted upwards, as if revealing a mocking expression. His eyes radiated a flash of killing intent. Hoisting the sword in his right hand, he immediately stabbed towards the black panther once more.This speed was faster than before, almost bordering the inconceivable. The black panther wasn\u2019t able to dodge the sword this time and so the sword speared through its throat before it could even react. Due to the panther\u2019s momentum, the sword in its throat penetrated even more deeply. The sword only stopped after it was completely buried in the panther\u2019s throat up to its hilt. The other side of the sword was already covered in blood as it pierced through the back of the panther\u2019s neck. Blood started to drip from the inclined sword onto the back of the black panther.The youth slowly pulled out his sword from the black panther. Afterwards, the blood on the sword strangely started to gather at the tip of the sword, and drip onto the ground. In the blink of an eye, the originally bloody sword had regained its original bright luster.On the hilt of the sword were two words\u2013Light Wind.This youth was Jian Chen, who was adventuring around the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts alone. Unknowingly, he had already stayed in the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts for a month. This whole month, Jian Chen had remained in the outskirts of the mountain range, not going deeper in or farther out.During this month, Jian Chen would explore the outskirts of the mountain range during the day, and cultivate during the night. During this period of time, he had focused primarily on improving his strength, unlike back in Changyang Mansion where he had to slow down his cultivation speed so that his performance wouldn\u2019t be too outstanding. Because of that, Jian Chen\u2019s strength had practically skyrocketed in the course of a month. He had already broken through from a Peak Saint to become a Great Saint.In this short month, Jian Chen went from a Primary Saint to a Great Saint. If this speed was to be found out by the public, then it would send a huge shockwave throughout the continent. This was because for any regular person, it would take two or three years to go from a Primary Saint to a Great Saint. Even geniuses would need around a year, so Jian Chen\u2019s frightening speed was unheard of. Unbeknownst to everyone else, he had already set a new record in the history of Tian Yuan Continent. But this would be a piece of history that would be buried deep, never to be heard about by anyone.Since he had broken through to the Great Saint level, Jian Chen\u2019s fighting strength had skyrocketed as well. The current him could easily hunt down a Class 2 Magical Beasts, and he had already set his sights on Class 3 Magical Beasts.The Light Wind Sword dissected the black panther, before a bloodstained but white monster core came bouncing out, which was caught by Jian Chen.Jian Chen casually used a handful of grass to wipe the bloody monster core clean even though he himself could care less about the amount of blood on it.Looking at the single core in his hand, Jian Chen smiled and murmured to himself, \u201cMy luck today is not that bad, I\u2019ve collected 12 Class 2 Monster Cores already.\u201dAfter grabbing the core, Jian Chen didn\u2019t pay any further mind to the black panther\u2019s corpse and left the area.Jian Chen carefully trekked inside the mountain range. He was now a Great Saint, so it could be said that he was a lot stronger than before. However, he was in the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts so he didn\u2019t dare to be careless. He knew clearly that while his position was currently in the outskirts of the mountain range, he would still be able to encounter some stronger magical beasts that came from the deeper parts of the mountain range, ones that Jian Chen currently wouldn\u2019t be able to handle .It could even be said that the current Jian Chen was very vigilant. Carefully looking around constantly, he had to be extra careful, especially with the hidden swamps since they were very hard to detect. From far away, the flatlands and swamps couldn\u2019t really be differentiated. But the moment one walked over a swamp, they would be devoured by it, and wouldn\u2019t be able to escape without another person\u2019s help.Right at this moment, Jian Chen\u2019s ear twitched. He began to shout with a great big smile, \u201cWater, I can hear the sounds of water! There\u2019s water around here.\u201d Jian Chen immediately headed towards the direction of the water with great speed.Not too long after, Jian Chen passed through some tall weeds and finally reached a small stream. This creek was only three meters wide and wasn\u2019t too deep. Yet the water was so clear that the stones on the bottom of the river could be clearly seen.Seeing this river, Jian Chen smiled with joy. This was the first time he had come across a water source since entering the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts. And after all the time he had spent here, the clean water he had in his Space Belt was almost all gone. If he hadn\u2019t found a water source soon, he had considered leaving the forest.Looking around the place, he inspected it to ensure it was safe, before pulling out a few canteens from within his Space Belt before kneeling down to fill them with water.After a few more canteens were filled, Jian Chen threw off his clothes and jumped into the stream to wash away the sweat he had built up on his body.Not even a few seconds after Jian Chen started to bathe, his face suddenly changed expression from a relaxed one to a battle ready expression in an instant. Immediately leaping up into the air from the water, he materialized his Light Wind Sword into his right hand, and stabbed downwards with it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His whole body maintained a stabbing posture while he was suspended in midair. The tip of his sword accurately pierced the head of the golden vine-like creature.This scene lasted for a span of two breaths. Suddenly, from the forest next to the river, another golden vine suddenly burst out from the tall grass and flew at Jian Chen.Jian Chen\u2019s face didn\u2019t change from the sudden ambush. Bracing his arm as he prepared to borrow the power of the golden vine-like thing below him to gain momentum, he kicked off of his attacker and whirled through the air, landing firmly down by the riverside. The moment he hit the ground, he immediately sprinted to where his clothes were and put them on.After putting on his clothes, Jian Chen looked up to assess the golden vine-like thing only to find out that it was a golden snake. Its entire body was golden in color, but there were a few silver lines going from the top of its head to its tail. It was also long in length; just the exposed area alone was almost 6 meters long. The moment Jian Chen noticed the silver streak on its body, he was stunned. It seemed like he had remembered something, as his face suddenly changed dramatically. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim loudly, \u201cSilver Striped Golden Snake!\u201dThe Silver Striped Golden Snake was something that Jian Chen had read about before from the books in the academy\u2019s library. It was a rare magical beast that was regarded as the emperor of serpents. In the entire Tian Yuan Continent, considering the tens of thousands of magical beasts, the population size of Silver Striped Golden Snakes barely even reached three digits. .The Silver Striped Golden Snake wasn\u2019t precious because of its rarity, but because of its body. Whether it was for meat or blood, it was very valuable. The venom in its body was especially precious; it belonged to the type of goods in the Tian Yuan Continent where there was no market, even if people offered high prices for them.This was because if this highly toxic venom was specially refined, it could even kill a Peak Heaven Saint Master. Moreover, purging this venom was impossible. Unless one had the blood of the Silver Striped Golden Snake, there was no other method; even a Radiant Saint Master wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it. Although the Light Saint Force had mystical healing effects, and could detoxify many poisons, it simply couldn\u2019t remove the unique and highly toxic venom that a Silver Striped Golden Snake possessed, as well as several other rather special types of venom. At most, a Radiant Saint Master would only be able to temporarily suppress the poison; however, completely purging it was impossible.Also, the Silver Striped Golden Snake was different compared to any other snake. Not only was it long it was also relatively thin. It could be said that a few Silver Striped Golden Snakes that reached the Class 5 Magical Beast rank would reach up to a hundred meters long, but their widths would not even be thirty centimeters wide.A Class 6 Silver Striped Golden Snake was able to control the size of its body, and could even shrink its body down to one or two meters long.Not only were Class 6 Silver Striped Golden Snakes very strong, but rumors said that they could fly through the air and burrow into the ground. Its venom was unrivaled, and even a Heaven Saint Master would be afraid of the consequences of being infected by one.In the ancient records, a hundred years ago in the Holy Empire, a Class 6 Silver Striped Golden Snake had laid waste to a King City with the population of ten million people in the time it took for a candle wick to burn out. Every single person was killed by the potent venom even decayed corpses. All that was left in the city was the stench of fresh blood that rose endlessly into the air.After this horrifying event, the Holy Empire sent out over ten Heaven Saint Masters to go kill the Silver Striped Golden Snake. But before half a day was over, seven of the Heaven Saint Masters were killed by the poison with the remaining few having serious injuries or were poisoned heavily. However not long afterwards, the remaining few experts that were poisoned died as well.This event had caused every single Saint Ruler in the Holy Empire to become shocked. In the end, a Saint Ruler finally fought the Silver Striped Golden Snake in an earth shattering battle that had only led in the withdrawal of the beast instead of killing it.But in the end, everyone knew how strong a Silver Striped Golden Snake could become.Recalling the information he had read about this beast back in Kargath Library, Jian Chen looked at the golden colored snake with a horrified look of disbelief. His heart couldn\u2019t help, but begin to race rapidly. He didn\u2019t think that he would come across the rare Silver Striped Golden Snake in such a desolate place like the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts; it was only the outskirts of the Mountain Range, where it should\u2019ve been hard to even encounter one on the entire Tian Yuan Continent.Sweeping his eyes over the wrist sized snake attentively, Jian Chen had to concede to the fact that he had come across a Silver Striped Golden Snake.\u201cWhat terrible luck, how could I come across such a thing?\u201d Jian Chen quickly calmed himself, but inwardly, he was still cursing to himself. He knew how terrifying a Silver Striped Golden Snake could be despite never seeing one in real life. Just reading about it was enough for Jian Chen to understand that with his current Great Saint strength, fighting against a Silver Striped Golden Snake was extremely troublesome.Jian Chen heavily stared at the Silver Striped Golden Snake only ten meters away from him, his gaze filled with vigilance. He gripped his sword tightly as he thought about the fact that the Silver Striped Golden Snake he encountered was no ordinary magical beast. A single mistake could possible cause him to lose his life today.This was definitely the most dangerous encounter that Jian Chen had experienced since he had first entered the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts. It was to the point where he was unsure if he would be able to leave the place alive.If it was any other strong magical beast that Jian Chen couldn\u2019t defeat, he would still be able to run away. But the moment he recognized the Silver Striped Golden Snake, he had already given up all such notions He was fast; even if he just relied on his Saint\u2019s strength, he could surpass the speed of a wind attribute practitioner. However, Jian Chen was sure that his speed was incomparable to the snake\u2019s; he wouldn\u2019t even be qualified to carry the shoes for the snake if it owned any.That was because the Silver Striped Golden Snake was extremely fast while running in a straight line. Although it wasn\u2019t the fastest magical beast, when it came to the ones that crawled on the ground, the Silver Striped Golden Snake was in the top three. When compared to humanity, unless you had the wind attribute and were multiple ranks higher than the snake, then you wouldn\u2019t be fast enough to outrun it.\u201cWhen seeing a Silver Striped Golden Snake, one cannot run away in a straight line, or else a dead end will be the only thing that\u2019ll greet them. I don\u2019t know how strong this snake is either; if it is a Class 1 Magical Beast, then the danger will be significantly smaller, and I might be able to kill it. If it\u2019s a Class 2 Magical Beast, then there will be a bigger threat to my life, but I should be able to run away from it with no problem.\u201d Jian Chen muttered. Right now, his only wish was for the snake to not be too strong; otherwise, he didn\u2019t think he would be able to leave this place alive.As Jian Chen was pondering to himself in that brief moment, the Silver Striped Golden Snake suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a gray poisonous mist that quickly floated over to where Jian Chen stood. As it floated over, every single plant life in the mist immediately began to wilt, and even the larger trees were noticeably changing. In a flash, it looked as if its very life was being drained away quickly.The moment the gray gas drew closer, Jian Chen\u2019s head started to feel a little dizzy. At the same time, Jian Chen felt as if his strength was being sucked right out of him.Feeling the change that was happening in his body, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes widened in shock; he realized the Silver Striped Golden Snake could directly contaminate the air with its poison. Now he finally knew how terrifying the poison was; it was no wonder that the poison could easily kill a Heaven Saint Master.Without hesitating, he bit down onto his tongue with his teeth. The piercing pain from his tongue finally cleared away the dizziness he was feeling. After that, he jumped further back, and began to circulate his Saint Force around him so that the strength draining sensation was weakened.Once again calming himself down, Jian Chen narrowed his eyes in concentration. Although he hadn\u2019t fought the Silver Striped Golden Snake yet and only experienced its poison, Jian Chen could deduce that this snake was at the very least a Class 2 Magical Beast.Seeing the poisonous fog float closer, Jian Chen didn\u2019t hesitate before immediately holding his breath. His legs glided across the floor as he ran further away from the poison.The moment Jian Chen began to move, so did the snake. Turning into a golden streak of light, it flew towards Jian Chen at a speed multiple times faster than him.Although the Silver Striped Golden Snake was only the size of his wrist in width, it was still very fast. In the blink of an eye, it had already caught up to where Jian Chen was, with its mouth wide open: ready to bite his neck.Right as the Silver Striped Golden Snake was about to bite into Jian Chen\u2019s neck, Jian Chen tilted his head in this crucial moment and retreated backwards. At the same time, his Light Wind Sword flickered into view in his right hand. With a single swing, a silver light came trailing behind the blade, slashing at the snake. With a large amount of Sword Qi concentrated together, the sword trail left behind looked like the lunar moon, and left a dazzling effect. Jian Chen had used his entire strength in that one swing.The Light Wind Sword met no obstructions as it smoothly stabbed towards the Silver Striped Golden Snake. But there was no excitement on Jian Chen\u2019s face; in fact, his face had started to look quite unsightly, as his sword didn\u2019t pierce through the scaly skin of the snake. Not a single mark could be seen on the scales.\u201cWhat a strong defense.\u201d Jian Chen gasped, his face deathly pale; because of his cultivation methods, his attacking power was extraordinarily strong. Although he only had the power of a Great Saint, his attack was not much weaker than a Saint Master\u2019s. But an attack with his entire strength hadn\u2019t left even a single trace on the Silver Striped Golden Snake. By this point, Jian Chen was aware that this Silver Striped Golden Snake was at the very least a Class 3 Magical Beast, maybe a Class 4 Magical Beast. This was not a fight Jian Chen could afford to have.If it were an ordinary Class 3 Magical Beast, Jian Chen would have to expend a little more energy to kill it, but the Silver Striped Snake couldn\u2019t be evaluated the same way as a normal magical beast could.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brandishing its sharp fangs, a continuous stream of gray colored poisonous mist flowed out from its mouth.Sensing the wide open jaws of the snake biting towards him, Jian Chen immediately tilted his head to the side to dodge the gaping maw of the beast. Immediately after, his furious footsteps moved him around to the back of the Silver Striped Golden Snake. Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword shined brightly as he swung it down onto the snake\u2019s body once more, refusing to believe that it would be ineffective.The Light Wind Sword accurately stabbed against the skin of the Silver Striped Golden Snake, but only stopped at the very first layer of the snake\u2019s scale, unable to penetrate any further. The thin golden skin was as like an impenetrable fort; no marks would remain on it even from a full powered blow of Jian Chen.Seeing this, Jian Chen\u2019s face became even more grim. His mood, after discovering how ineffective his sword was, had completely dropped. The Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s powerful defenses had left Jian Chen with no options, as his strongest attacks against the powerful defense of the snake were like a child\u2019s scratches, wouldn\u2019t cause any harm.Jian Chen didn\u2019t hesitate at all. Immediately recalling his sword, he gathered strength in both legs to jump off the ground. Before the snake could react, his body was already high up in the air. After getting his bearings, he borrowed the power of the tree branches and flew towards the abyss of the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts.The Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s strong defense wasn\u2019t something Jian Chen could handle. All Jian Chen could do was run away into the depths of the mountain range in hopes that another strong magical beast would somehow attract the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s attention. This was the only way Jian Chen would be able to escape. Although this method would be braving huge danger, there was no other choice.Jian Chen knew that there were many mercenaries within the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts that he might be able to draw support from to help stall the Silver Striped Golden Snake. However, the mountain range was simply too vast, and the chances of meeting up with another mercenary was quite slim.Jian Chen flew into the air, using the tree branches on either side of him to catapult himself into the direction of the mountain range. Right behind him was the Silver Striped Golden Snake that was in close pursuit, its tongue continuously flickering up and down. The upright part of its body was 6-7 meters long.The snake was fairly long, and its body dimensions weren\u2019t scaled completely yet. At that moment Jian Chen hadn\u2019t seen the features of the snake completely. However, he could estimate that judging from what he had seen from the Silver Striped Golden Snake so far, it was at the very least fifty meters long.Jian Chen continued to run in an S shaped trajectory while looking for obstacles in hopes that the Silver Striped Golden Snake would be blocked.\u201cRawr!\u201dSuddenly, the roar of a tiger could be heard nearby. The sound of its arrival quickly headed towards Jian Chen\u2019s direction, and soon after, Jian Chen saw a three meter long black tiger appear within his line of sight. The tiger\u2019s eyes glinted with an ominous feeling as it looked at Jian Chen, but just as it was about to pounce at him, a golden vine-like body fifty meters long appeared before it.The moment it saw the golden snake, it was as if the black tiger had received an electrical shock. All of the fur on its body flew straight up as the ominous glint in its eye withered away to nothing in an instant. Fear replaced the ominous glint as it looked at the snake. Not daring to stay any longer, the black tiger quickly ran away with its tail between its legs.Although the Silver Striped Golden Snake was a serpent, if put in a crowd of magical beasts, most magical beasts would not dare try to bother it.This type of situation had happened in the mountain range many times before. Jian Chen had come across many different types of magical beasts, but this was the first time he saw one retreat so fast after seeing the Silver Striped Golden Snake. This black tiger had practically pissed itself without a sound, as it gloomily began to run away. There wasn\u2019t a single magical beast here that would dare provoke the Silver Striped Golden Snake behind him.An hour later, Jian Chen was already close to the abyss of the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts. The forest was growing more and more lush, causing Jian Chen to encounter more obstacles in his way. Right behind him, the Silver Striped Golden Snake was chasing him relentlessly. It was as if the snake had determined that Jian Chen was its prey; despite coming across a vast amount of magical beasts, its gaze continued to remain locked onto Jian Chen.\u201cHiss!\u201d The snake\u2019s head disappeared with a blur as it nipped at Jian Chen once more.Jian Chen was constantly keeping track of the situation behind him, and so the moment he saw the snake move towards him, his legs pushed off of the sturdy tree branch he was on. The sudden force propelled him to the side, causing the snake to miss.Over and over again, Jian Chen continued to dodge the snake\u2019s attacks. The Silver Striped Golden Snake grew angrier with each failure, as the dangerous glint in its eyes intensified. Suddenly, a long, golden snake tail quickly flew out from the tall grass toward Jian Chen.Jian Chen\u2019s expression changed as he noticed the tail come at him. Noticing the sturdy tree branch to his side, he immediately jumped and kicked away from his spot without hesitation. His entire body was then sent flying forward towards a large tree with dense, leafy branches.The tail of the snake immediately changed its angle and shot at Jian Chen with breakneck speeds. It caught up to Jian Chen in an instant, and began to wind around his waist tightly.As the tail wound around his waist, Jian Chen\u2019s face turned pale with fright. The Light Wind Sword began to glow brightly, immediately slashing down at the tail. But because the outer scales were extremely tough, Jian Chen\u2019s sword left no marks at all.At that moment, a stinky stench wafted on over as the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s mouth, which was even larger than its body, could be seen. In a flash, it flew towards Jian Chen\u2019s neck, and was about to clamp down on it.Without any time to prepare himself, Jian Chen immediately thrust his Light Wind Sword at the snake\u2019s mouth in alarm.But the snake was cunning, and it twisted its head to dodge the sword. Afterwards, the snake opened its jaws wide and sunk its sharp fangs deeply into Jian Chen\u2019s left shoulder.Feeling the intense pain in his left shoulder, Jian Chen\u2019s face drained of blood. The venom of the Silver Striped Golden Snake was very strong, and once bitten, the only antidote was the lifeblood of the snake. There was no other method; even a Radiant Saint Master wouldn\u2019t be able to cure it.But the scales of the Silver Striped Golden Snake were far too strong for Jian Chen\u2019s current strength to even leave a mark on, let alone bypass them to acquire blood.Seeing the snake tightly biting down on his shoulder, Jian Chen grew even more panicked by the second, and his expression became crazed. Influenced by this state of mind, Jian Chen\u2019s \u201cSoul\u201d became unprecedentedly active, as a hazy picture of the scenery around him came into view in his mind. Although this feeling was very faint, if Jian Chen was not sensing it intentionally, he wouldn\u2019t be able to feel anything. However, as his emotions currently were very agitated, he did not notice this fact.\u201cAh!\u201d Jian Chen bellowed into the sky. Without even caring if he could break through the snake\u2019s defenses or not, he brought the Light Wind Sword up into the air before swinging the sword back down, in hopes of beheading it.The moment the Light Wind Sword came down, it was as if Jian Chen\u2019s spirit connected with the sword in his hand. It was like the two had completely merged into one, without any distinction . The union was so smooth that it brought up an indescribable feeling within his heart, as if his sword was his spirit and his spirit was his sword.At the same time, the azure and violet glows within his dantian began to flicker, as a weak light ray started to spread throughout his body from these two points of light. While Jian Chen himself was unaware of this, the rays had already started to spread from his head.\u201cShing!\u201d The sword in Jian Chen\u2019s hand emitted a loud sound as a formidable amount of Sword Qi completely enveloped the sword. This time, the Sword Qi looked as if a dense fog had covered the sword. The blade within was indistinct, making it hard to see.\u201cDing!\u201d The Light Wind Sword viciously smashed into the head of the Silver Striped Golden Snake. A light noise rang out; this time, the strong Sword Qi had allowed the sword to cut through the first layer of the super strong defensive snake scales. Immediately, a deep looking wound appeared on top of the snake\u2019s head, and fresh blood began to flow profusely from the wound.\u201cHiss!\u201d The Silver Striped Golden Snake hissed out in pain. Its bite on Jian Chen\u2019s shoulder was loosened, and it slithered away from him. Its eyes were closely locked onto Jian Chen, as it flicked its forked tongue out repeatedly.Seeing the bloody wound on the snake\u2019s head, Jian Chen was momentarily stunned. But soon afterwards, a joyous expression formed on his face.\u201cSo it seems the Spirit Sword can break through the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s defenses.\u201d Jian Chen cheered inwardly. Under his deliberate control, the sword and his spirit had joined together so that the sword became the spirit and the spirit became the sword. This type of miraculous fusion that Jian Chen had clearly felt made him feel as if this sword was his life, his soul.As Jian Chen\u2019s connection between the sword and his spirit deepened, the violent Sword Qi around his Light Wind Sword grew even sharper. It was as if this large amount of Sword Qi was completely controlled by his spirit .Not too experienced with such a mysterious sensation, Jian Chen loosened his hold on the Light Wind Sword. The sword that was completely enveloped with Sword Qi didn\u2019t drop to the ground, but instead hung queerly in midair. It slowly ascended, finally stopping around Jian Chen\u2019s nose level a meter away from him. The tip of the sword directly pointed at the Silver Striped Golden Snake.\u201cShing!\u201d A clear, drawn-out sword cry was heard from within the Light Wind Sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The incredibly strong and sharp Sword Qi gave off a dangerous air around it that the Silver Striped Golden Snake could easily feel, which made it not dare to attack carelessly.Jian Chen slowly closed his eyes as he continued to carefully experience the mysterious sensation born from his spirit controlling the sword. Following this, his intention changed, and the Light Wind Sword became a silver streak of lightning and flew towards the snake without anyone moving it, at an unbelievably fast speed.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dAs the sword traveled through the air towards the head of the Silver Striped Golden Snake, it emitted an ear piercing shriek. Before the Silver Striped Golden Snake could even react, the Light Wind Sword had already pierced deep into its brain. Immediately, a deep wound appeared on its head as fresh blood began to flow out from it, dying the head of the snake a bloody red.Even though Jian Chen was still bound up by the snake\u2019s tail in midair, seeing the wound he inflicted on the snake made him very happy. Since he could break apart the first layer of the snake\u2019s defenses, this meant that Jian Chen had a chance of beheading and killing the snake.Jian Chen once again used his spirit controlled sword technique to continuously attack the snake.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dThe Light Wind Sword under Jian Chen\u2019s control appeared to be a silver-white flash of lightning as it stabbed towards the Silver Striped Golden Snake repeatedly. However, the direction he was attacking toward was now the body of the snake.Following the silver streak of light that flashed into the body of the Silver Striped Golden Snake, another deep bloody wound appeared. Although the wound wasn\u2019t a light one, it clearly hadn\u2019t damaged the vital regions of the snake.The snake\u2019s heart was located seven inches away from its head. Although this attack had broken the snake\u2019s skin right above its heart, its defense provided such a powerful resistance that the Light Wind Sword couldn\u2019t harm the heart at all.Feeling the layer of skin where its heart was being attacked, the snake became more frantic. In a rush, the snake began to coil its body around itself so that it could protect the spot that was just attacked. At the same time, the tail that wound around Jian Chen\u2019s body had loosened and released him.No longer constrained by the snake, Jian Chen dropped down to the ground. Just after he landed, a strong wave of nausea surged through Jian Chen\u2019s head, but it was quickly suppressed by Jian Chen\u2019s spirit.Using his right hand as a support, Jian Chen crawled up from the ground with some difficulty. He glanced at his left arm which he had completely lost all feeling. Sensing that his whole body had become really weak, Jian Chen\u2019s expression changed. With a sudden burst of power in his right arm, he ripped apart his own clothes, and saw that the entire section of his body starting from the end of his right arm all the way to the left half of his chest was pitch-black. The color was also visibly spreading throughout his entire body.\u201cWhat a strong venom.\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s face sank. Only a span of a few breaths time had passed since he had first been bitten by the snake, but within this short period, the poison had already spread to half of his body. Such a pace of progression caused Jian Chen to feel terrified. Moreover, the most frightening part was that his Saint Force was unable to suppress the spread of the venom.Remembering that the light Saint Force was able ot help suppress the venom, Jian Chen didn\u2019t hesitate at all. While using his Light Wind Sword to fight off the Silver Striped Golden Snake and prevent any further attacks towards himself, he began to rapidly gather the light Saint Force from within the World Essence toward himself.Under Jian Chen\u2019s control, the light Saint Force began to gather where Jian Chen was with extreme speed. Upon reaching a certain concentration, a hazy white glow appeared around his surroundings and was growing stronger very quickly. In the span of a few breaths, that previously hazy layer of white glow had completely changed into a strong milky white radiance, enshrouding Jian Chen within it. It was as if he was wrapped within a white cocoon, and while the glow radiating from it was strong, it did not hurt the eyes.Within the cocoon, the light Saint Force began to enter Jian Chen\u2019s body as a steady stream. The quickly reacting poison had finally met with an obstruction, and it began to slow down tremendously. However, that was the only effect. Although the light Saint Force could bring about a miraculous healing effect and heal many of the world\u2019s strongest snake venoms easily, it was not so for the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s poison. The light Saint Force could only bring about a temporary repressive effect.On the other side of the cocoon, the Light Wind Sword changed into a silver radiance that spiralled around the snake endlessly, leaving a silvery white circle in the air. Trapped within the spiral, the Silver Striped Golden Snake stared vigilantly at the light while protecting the injured part of its body, without exposing it at all. Even the snake had realized by now that its life was being significantly threatened\u201cWhoosh!\u201dThe Light Wind Sword swirled around the snake with an ear piercing sound. In a split second, the sword stabbed at the snake\u2019s head.Under the control of Jian Chen\u2019s spirit, the Light Wind Sword was simply too fast, multiple times faster than if Jian Chen were to personally swing it. Before the snake could even react, the sword had pierced its head once again.\u201cHiss!\u201dFeeling a sharp pain, the Silver Striped Golden Snake began to hiss in pain while its forked tongue flicked about. Finally, it opened its mouth wide, and a thick gray fog of snake venom began to float out. The fog quickly spread out to the rest of the environment. In a flash, the plant life began to wilt rapidly. Even the nearby trees that had very strong vitality couldn\u2019t resist this venom; they withered as the previously lush leaves became orange, falling down to the ground slowly, as if it was autumn.As the poisonous fog permeated the air of the surrounding area and dissipated into the surroundings, the previously verdant and lush trees began to wither and wilt as they came into contact with the fog.When the poisonous fog had first appeared, Jian Chen had immediately held his breath, as the milky white cocoon rapidly dissipated. Even with the light Saint Force, the extremely dangerous snake venom could not be cured, so Jian Chen was very afraid of this fog.Borrowing the cover of its poisonous fog, the Silver Striped Golden Snake began to move; it immediately slithered backwards to escape.The infamous snake that had spread fear with its name alone was feeling dread in its heart from the speed of the Light Wind Sword, as the snake couldn\u2019t follow the blade\u2019s movements. In a life threatening situation like this one, the Silver Striped Golden Snake had given up on chasing Jian Chen.Seeing the snake trying to run away, Jian Chen became anxious. Without hesitation, he commanded the Light Wind Sword to chase after it at the fastest speed possible.Since he was poisoned by the venom from earlier, he definitely needed the blood of the Silver Striped Golden Snake to cure himself. Otherwise, even if he were to use the light Saint Force to suppress the spread of the venom, he would still die in the end. This was because the light Saint Force was only a temporary measure. Moreover, gathering the light Saint Force took a lot out of him, so Jian Chen wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it up forever.The Light Wind Sword streaked by the forests in a huge ray of light. In a flash, it had caught up to the Silver Striped Golden Snake and stabbed into its body near where its heart was.Against the fast speed of the Light Wind Sword, the snake had no time to react at all; the sword easily penetrated its underside and through its heart.When the sword stabbed into its heart, the Silver Striped Golden Snake shook heavily a final time before it came to a grinding halt. With a loud desolate hiss that shook the heavens, it fell to the ground lifelessly.\u201cPhew!\u201d Jian Chen let out a long breath of air. The heart that had previously leapt into his throat had finally calmed down, as Jian Chen had finally protected his life successfully.A loud metallic sound was heard as the Light Wind Sword flew out of the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s body before flying around in the sky. Then it flashed towards Jian Chen, and returned back to his right hand.Seeing the sword in his hand, Jian Chen suppressed the elation in his heart. He immediately ran over to the body of the Silver Striped Golden Snake; he needed to absorb the blood in order to detoxify himself. He had to do it now since in the Magical Beast Mountain Range, every moment delayed added to the unknown danger that existed.Walking shakily toward the nearly 50 meters long carcass of the snake, Jian Chen knelt down, grabbed onto the bleeding part of the snake\u2019s body to bring it to his mouth, and began to suck the blood without any hesitation.\u201cGudong!\u201d \u201cGudong!\u201dWithout stopping, Jian Chen continued to swallow the snake\u2019s blood in large gulps. He could clearly feel the special energy from within the snake\u2019s blood as it entered his stomach. Wherever this blood flowed to, the slowly creeping poison there instantly began to lessen, as the blood quickly counteracted and cured the poison.Feeling the changes within his body, Jian Chen started to drink even more of the snake\u2019s blood at an even quicker rate, as if it was a delicious delicacy he couldn\u2019t get enough of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Finally it began to assimilate into his veins at an extremely slow speed, absorbed by the body. At the same time, on the left part of his body including his shoulder where the venom was, the previously black skin color was rapidly fading, returning back to a normal skin color.Although the toxicity of the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s poison was incomparably strong, with only the snake\u2019s blood as the cure, this detoxifying process was also extremely fast.Not too long after, the poison inside Jian Chen\u2019s body was completely detoxified. Aside from the two initial bite marks left on his shoulder, the skin color of his body was back to normal.\u201cHu!\u201d Seeing how his body was healthy once more, Jian Chen let out sigh of relief. It was fortunate that in the very last moment when he was fighting the Silver Striped Golden Snake, he had managed to successfully kill it. If not, even if he had had the light Saint Force to temporarily help him suppress the spread of the venom, he would not have been able to live past three days. After all, he was not able to maintain light Saint Force for a long period, since using his \u201cSpirit\u201d consumed an extremely large amount of energy.Slowly standing on both feet, Jian Chen sized up the golden colored snake that lay on the floor before him with no small amount of excitement. The Silver Striped Golden Snake population didn\u2019t surpass three digits on the Tian Yuan Continent so it could be said to be a very rare species. In addition, the body of the Silver Striped Golden Snake was an extremely treasured commodity. This was no exaggeration; while the virulence of the poison was unmatched, its whole body was a treasure trove. It was said that the snake meat could not only help one improve their poison resistance, but also strengthen one\u2019s inner body. Although it would not be as monstrous as the defense of a Silver Striped Golden Snake, it would still make one significantly stronger than before.And the gall of the Silver Striped Golden Snake was said to be an extremely high grade medicinal ingredient\u00a0that could increase one\u2019s poison immunity if refined together with the blood of the Silver Striped Golden Snake with a special method. It was even possible to create a body that was immune for thousands of different types of poison, unless the toxicity of the poison was stronger than that of a Silver Striped Golden Snake, or another snake that was equally formidable. In all other cases, no poison under the heavens would pose a threat to the Ten Thousand Immunity.The fangs of the Silver Striped Golden Snake could also be synthesized into an extremely horrifying killing weapon. The fangs were constantly soaked from birth in the deadly venom day and night, to the point that the base quality of the fangs had slowly evolved. By this point, the venom had completely polluted the fangs, unable to be removed, and a single strike by those fangs would inject any enemy with the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s venom. If there was no Silver Striped Golden Snake blood to act as an antidote, then the only outcome for one who was injected with the venom was death. This type of venom was capable of poisoning even Heaven Saint Masters.Of course, this specific Silver Striped Golden Snake didn\u2019t have a strong enough venom to kill a Heaven Saint Master in a short moment, but it was strong enough that they would never be able to completely get rid of it. They would ultimately die from this venom if they didn\u2019t get the antidote \u2014 the snake\u2019s blood.Despite the venom being very strong, its toxicity was directly linked to the strength of the Silver Striped Golden Snake. The stronger the snake was, the stronger its venom was. If a Silver Striped Golden Snake were to reach the strength of a Class 6 Magical Beast, then its venom would definitely be capable of killing a Heaven Saint Master in a flash.The snake skin was not only soft, but it was also extremely durable, making it an extremely valuable material in producing armor. This gave it an incredibly high value.And with regards to the venom sack, it was considered to be priceless. This venom, when refined correctly, would become an odorless and colorless type of poison that could bypass any type of poison detection or people\u2019s senses. With this poison, even Heaven Saint Masters would be hard pressed to escape from death, since the only cure was the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s blood.The venom of the Silver Striped Golden Snake appeared on the market several times, but every time it appeared, men with particularly special motives paid sky-high prices to purchase it.Silently remembering the information he had read about about the various materials from the Silver Striped Golden Snake in books, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but feel excited. This was the biggest profit he had harvested since he entered the Magical Beast Mountain Range. Jian Chen was especially tempted for the ability to be resistant to most poisons.Without any hesitation, Jian Chen began to work on the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s body. When it came to this corpse, he was definitely not going to ignore it like he had with the other magical beasts.After expending a bit of energy, Jian Chen finally dragged the rest of the snake\u2019s body out of the tallgrass and piled it in one place. It wasn\u2019t until then that Jian Chen had realized that this Silver Striped Golden Snake was actually 70 meters long in length.The Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s strength could be determined by how long it was. A Class 1 Silver Striped Golden Snake was 20 meters at the very least. With every increase in class, it would grow 20 meters in length, all the way to a maximum of 100 meters long at Class 5 . Any Class 6 Silver Striped Golden Snake or higher would already be able to freely manipulate their body dimensions, so it was useless trying to rank one by its body length.Judging from the length of this snake, it looked as if it was on the verge of breaking through to the Class 4 rank.Jian Chen retrieved the Space Ring on his neck given to him by his father when he had departed from the Changyang Mansion. The space within the Space Ring was incomparably bigger compared to that of the Space Belt. If he wanted to bring this 70 meter long snake away, the only possible solution was to use the Space Ring to store it. There was no way the Space Belt would be able to store the body within its tiny internal space.But if Jian Chen wanted to store the 70 meter long Silver Striped Golden Snake within his Space Ring, it was not an easy task. Just as he was about to start, his face suddenly changed as he abruptly turned his head around.Where Jian Chen was looking, he saw the shadows of some people from within the foliage walk out. Just as Jian Chen spotted them, they discovered his existence at the same time.\u201cWhat terrible luck!\u201d Jian Chen cursed, afraid that he was going to meet with some trouble.There was a total of 20 people who looked to be mercenaries from their outfit. The moment they saw Jian Chen, the mercenaries all looked a bit dumbfounded. To have come across Jian Chen, it was clear that this was unexpected. However, immediately after, their eyes were drawn to the coiled body of the Silver Striped Golden Snake.Walking at the forefront of the other mercenaries was a middle aged man that looked to be around 40 years old. After his gaze fell on the Silver Striped Golden Snake, his brow slightly furrowed, revealing an expression deep in thought. Then, as if remembering something, his eyes flashed in realization. A look of extreme joy took over his entire face in an instant. As if he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, he continued to focus on the snake\u2019s body behind Jian Chen. He cried out, \u201cSilver Striped Golden Snake! This is actually the Silver Striped Golden Snake!\u201dThe words of the mercenary caused every other mercenary behind him to be stunned, as if they had never heard of such a magical beast before. Not too long after, the memories they had regarding the Silver Striped Golden Snake came back to them, causing their faces to change one by one. Looks of amazement and doubt filled their faces as they looked at the snake\u2019s corpse behind Jian Chen, and evaluated it. After closer inspection, more and more shouts of surprise that they were not able to repress rang through the air.\u201cSo this is the Silver Striped Golden Snake?\u201d\u201cThis really is the Silver Striped Golden Snake; it looks exactly how the rumors describe it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d come across a Silver Striped Golden Snake here, we\u2019re rich!\u201d\u2026\u2026..Every kind of surprised comment came from the mouths of the mercenaries as their eyes began to heat up from looking at the Silver Striped Golden Snake. The avarice of greed in their eyes was shown on their faces; they didn\u2019t try to hide it.Jian Chen sighed to himself. He didn\u2019t think that such an unfortunate event would happen at such a crucial point. This was definitely the last thing he had wanted; it was a shame that fate didn\u2019t go as he had wished.Quickly hiding his Space Ring, the silver glow from his Light Wind Sword appeared in his hand once more. Without any hesitation, he disappeared in a blur as he charged towards the group of mercenaries.The people in front of him had already recognized the Silver Striped Golden Snake and its worth. There was no point in contemplating any further, since Jian Chen knew that these mercenaries would try to take the body from him by any means necessary. There was definitely no room for negotiation.Jian Chen crossed the 30 meters between them in a flash, the Light Wind Sword immediately striking out.\u201cHmph, you came. Good!\u201d The middle aged man that was the leader was not weak at all, and returned to his sense. A cold expression took over his previous joy as he stared at Jian Chen, sneered, and summoned a great sword to his hand. With a single movement, he slashed at the charging Jian Chen.Just as the middle aged man\u2019s sword was about to hit Jian Chen, Jian Chen\u2019s trajectory suddenly changed. He dodged the sword and moved around the middle aged man, attacking the group of mercenaries standing just behind the man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Chaotic Sword GodCH 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: Silencing by KillingSeeing Jian Chen come at them at such a high speed, the mercenaries all came to their senses and summoned their Saint Weapons in preparation to attack him.Jian Chen didn\u2019t want to be entangled with them, so instead of taking the blows head on, he dodged their attacks and quickly moved to their sides. In an instant, his sword sliced through the necks of two mercenaries.As the silver light disappeared, the two mercenaries became rigid as the light in their eyes slowly faded away. From their necks, a slow trickle of blood started to flow out for everyone to see. In the next instant, the blood suddenly began to surge out from their wounds as the bodies slowly toppled to the ground.Without slowing down, Jian Chen swept past the two dead bodies and charged at the hindmost mercenaries in the blink of an eye; these were the weakest of the group and thus were Jian Chen\u2019s first targets. Although there were around 20 mercenaries total, the majority of them were only Saints and Great Saints. Only the first middle aged man and one other were Saint Masters.Using the Profound Steps, Jian Chen immediately flickered behind the group. His Light Wind Sword flashed as mercenaries continued to fall to his blade. The mercenaries who were only Saints were unable to do anything against such a fast attack. Since they were unable to react at all, there was no way they could possibly resist.In the time it took to take a breath, the mercenaries that were barely at the Saint level had died by Jian Chen\u2019s sword. The remaining people who were of the Great Saint level or above had already started to prepare themselves to defend against Jian Chen.Even after killing all of the weak Saints, Jian Chen didn\u2019t pause at all. The Light Wind Sword became a flash of silver lightning as he swung out at the one of the Great Saint mercenaries next to him.Seeing such a fast attack come at him, the mercenary\u2019s face immediately changed. Since there was no time to dodge, he could only desperately throw his battleaxe up in front of him.But Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword was like a viper. With a single movement, its trajectory suddenly lowered and changed from aiming at the mercenary\u2019s throat to his heart.\u201cPft!\u201d This time, the Great Saint mercenary wasn\u2019t able to react. The silver streak that was the Light Wind Sword embedded itself deeply into the left side of the man\u2019s chest, piercing straight through his heart.Just as quickly as it entered, the sword was immediately pulled out of the man\u2019s chest. Jian Chen then began to move on to fiercely attack the other mercenaries.Seeing their comrades die so quickly right in front of their eyes, the remaining mercenaries all cried out in both anger and shock.\u201cBastard, go die!\u201d\u201cGive back the lives of our comrades!\u201dThe remaining Great Saint mercenaries all rallied together and raised their Saint Weapons to attack Jian Chen from various directions and seal off any possible escape routes Jian Chen had.Jian Chen let loose a subtle sneer before swinging his sword in a way that left a silver crescent trail behind. Like lightning, the sword pierced the other Great Saints.\u201cDing!\u201d \u201cDing!\u201d \u201cDing!\u201dIn that short moment, Jian Chen\u2019s sword had rapidly hit three of the mercenaries\u2019 Saint Weapons dead on. With each collision, a metallic sound rang out, but Jian Chen had swung so fast, it was it was hard to differentiate separate weapons, as the sound was was just like a single loud collision\u2019s.The moment the Light Wind Sword made contact, a large amount of force was transmitted back through the mercenaries\u2019 Saint Weapons.Feeling the feedback transmitted back to them, the mercenaries\u2019 faces all changed. Unable to control their bodies, they were forced back a few steps. None of them had thought that such a slender sword would contain a power that was definitely not inferior to any other\u2019s.The flash of light in that instant sparkled brightly with killing intent. Using the opportunity given by people suffering from temporary paralysis, Jian Chen\u00a0approached the unmoving mercenary. The Light Wind Sword became covered by a dense layer of Sword Qi, and it rapidly shot towards the mercenary\u2019s neck.Faced with such a fast sword, the mercenary hadn\u2019t managed to even regain his footing couldn\u2019t put up any form of resistance at all. During his final moment, his expression of one of shock and anger at the sight of the Light Wind Sword having already deeply pierced through his throat. Fresh blood suddenly burst forth directly from the hole, completely covering Jian Chen, as the sword was completely pushed through the body and out of the wound.Right at this moment, a strong gale attacked Jian Chen from behind. Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed as he immediately pulled his sword out from the neck of the mercenary he just killed. Jian Chen turned around with his Sword Qi enhanced Light Wind Sword, and quickly thrusted his blade behind him like a flash of silver-white lightning.\u201cClang!\u201dThe two finger-wide swords clashed against the three inch-wide blade in midair, neither Saint Weapon forced the other backwards, and the two were stuck in something like a stalemate.However, no one had noticed that the moment the swords had collided, Jian Chen\u2019s right arm had shaken twice afterwards.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes swivelled upwards to look at the owner of the great sword coldly. It was the middle aged mercenary that had first spoken out before; the man was looking at him with an extremely overcast expression, but his eyes were filled with intense killing intent.\u201cHaa!\u201d The middle aged man cried out angrily, the bloodlust flashing in his eyes. His left hand curled into a fist, and shot it out toward Jian Chen, bringing a bitter cold wind along with it.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed coldly as he sneered. Against the middle aged man\u2019s strong fist, he wouldn\u2019t run; instead, Jian Chen would raise his own fist without fear.\u201cBang!\u201dThe fists collided against each other with a loud bang. At the moment of contact, a powerful shock wave came out from between the two and affected everything in all directions. Under this almost invisible force of strength, the surrounding trees nearby the two combatants began to sway. Even some of the weeds nearby were immediately flattened to the ground.As for the two fighters, the force of their blows caused a powerful aftershock that forced the two to retreat a few steps. Finally, at a distance of 10m, the warrior was swaying back and forth while waiting for the opponent.The middle aged man looked at Jian Chen with an intense glare, \u201cYoungster, you\u2019re quite fast, I\u2019ll take great pleasure in disposing of you.\u201dThe remaining Great Saint mercenaries began to gather behind the middle aged man. Each one of them snarled at Jian Chen with an angry look.Jian Chen stared coldly at the group of mercenaries without saying a word. Since the Silver Striped Golden Snake was now discovered by them, Jian Chen had no other choice but to silence them. With the experiences from his previous world, Jian Chen wasn\u2019t some new inexperienced youth; he knew that if the news about the Silver Striped Golden Snake were to leak out, then it would bring him an endless amount of trouble since the snake was a very precious source of profit. Many of the major wealthy clans would go to war in order to obtain the Silver Striped Golden Snake. If he were to come across those clans, it would be even worse than his current troubles with the Hua Yun Sect, so this was something that Jian Chen wanted to avoid at all costs. Thus, with this chance, Jian Chen definitely wanted to kill the mercenaries here to stop the rumours before they started.There were only 11 mercenaries left in the group aside from the middle aged Saint Master. Another man that looked to be 30 years old had also possessed near Saint Master strength. Amongst this mercenary group, it was only that thirty year old man and middle aged man that could give threaten Jian Chen.Seeing that Jian Chen wasn\u2019t talking, the middle aged man spoke out loud, \u201cMy fellow brothers, attack with me! If we kill him, not only will our dead comrades be avenged, but that Silver Striped Golden Snake will be ours! If we can take that Silver Striped Golden Snake, then we will no longer have to risk our lives in the Magical Beast Mountain Range in order to earn a profit!\u201dWith that, the middle aged man charged towards Jian Chen, with the rest of the mercenaries following right behind him.Jian Chen still didn\u2019t say anything, but the fighting spirit within his heart had unconsciously reached a high point. Raising the Light Wind Sword, Jian Chen activated his Profound Steps and flew towards the group of mercenaries.\u201cHa!\u201d Seeing the charging Jian Chen, the middle aged man\u2019s eyes revealed the killing intent within them. He brought his great sword high up into the air to prepare for splitting Jian Chen\u2019s head in two later.Jian Chen sneered once more; he had no wish to meet with the middle aged man. Altering his path, he slid by the man and continued onwards to fight the weaker mercenaries.But the middle aged man had already taken a loss before from the very same tactics. He could only see the great sword suddenly change engles in midair as the path was changed with only brute force. Afterwards, the great sword followed behind Jian Chen, swept past his shadow, then continued to slash horizontally toward Jian Chen.The great sword was definitely fast as well. As it traveled towards Jian Chen\u2019s back, it carried about a strong gust of wind that immediately cut into Jian Chen\u2019s waist without obstruction.However there were no signs of a smile on the middle aged man\u2019s face. Instead, his gaze hardened as he realized Jian Chen\u2019s body gradually disappeared. \u201cMirror image!\u201d He growled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, the mercenaries raised their Saint Weapons one after another to swing at him.\u201cDing ding ding!\u201dThe noise of many weapons colliding could be heard. In a brief moment, Jian Chen used an unimaginably fast speed to slash out dozens of times, causing the Saint Weapons that the mercenaries attacked him with to deviate from their original trajectories. Afterwards, Jian Chen\u2019s actions contained no hesitation as the Light Wind Sword in his hand emitted an indistinct sword glow. Taking advantage of the moment where the mercenaries were trying to bring their Saint Weapons in their hands back under control, the Light Wind Sword once again transformed into dozens of silvery white flashes that pierced outwards.\u201cPf!\u201d \u201cPf!\u201d \u201cPf!\u201dIn that short moment, Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword stabbed out three times, each one accurately hitting the throats of three different mercenaries. Their bodies went rigid immediately as their throats started to leak blood, dying their necks red. Slowly, their bodies fell to the ground.At that moment, a sharp sound carrying a strong amount of power pierced the air, whooshing in from the side. Sensing this strength that suddenly appeared out of nowhere, Jian Chen immediately turned around and shifted toward the side by two meters. But before Jian Chen could get to the side safely, another surge of wind came at Jian Chen and arrived right in front of him in a blink of an eye.Jian Chen\u2019s face didn\u2019t change at all as he brought his Light Wind Sword to block the frontal attack.\u201cClang!\u201dA huge sword heavily smashed against Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword, causing Jian Chen to fly back uncontrollably by quite a few meters.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dAs Jian Chen flew through the air, a long silver spear chased after Jian Chen\u2019s heart with an ear piercing whistle.Sensing that the silver spear had a great amount of Saint Force within it, Jian Chen grew solemn as he saw the second Saint Master had finally taken action.Jian Chen stamped down onto the ground fiercely, leaving a deep footprint as he forcibly stopped his body from continuously retreating backwards, His right hand shook as his Light Wind Sword slashed at the spear in front of him without fear.\u201cDing!\u201dThe tips of the Light Wind Sword and spear collided into each other in midair. Seeing this, Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed coldly as an intense amount of Sword Qi escaped from his sword. It transmitted through the spear toward the 30 year old man.Catching on to what Jian Chen was planning, the 30 year old man sneered. Following after, an enormous amount of Saint Force came flooding out from his body, coursing along the spear toward the Light Wind Sword. It stopped Jian Chen\u2019s Sword Qi in the spear from moving any closer. Immediately afterwards, the Sword Qi momentarily stopped advancing forward due to the collision with the flood of Saint Force that moved like a galloping wild horse. This weakened its advancing speed.Jian Chen\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously as he began to increase the amount of energy to fight against the man. Immediately, an intense amount of Sword Qi surged outwards, smashing against the Saint Force of the other man without fear.\u201cBang!\u201dAs Jian Chen\u2019s unique Sword Qi made contact with the other mercenary\u2019s Saint Force, a loud explosion was heard. The energy from the contact exploded outwards, with the colliding Saint Weapons as the epicenter.The shock wave caused the two fighters to be blown backwards. With each step they traveled, the mercenary left a deep footprint from stepping heavily on the ground. However, Jian Chen\u2019s body looked incomparably nimble. As his toes lightly made contact with the ground, he swayed momentarily before quickly shaking off that backwards momentum.However, just as Jian Chen stabilized his body, a fierce force came from behind him and approached his body in a blink of an eye.Jian Chen\u2019s face changed slightly. Just from his recent encounter against that mercenary, he had used up a lot of energy. At the moment, he was lacking some strength, and was unable to gather enough Saint Force to resist the incredibly strong Saint Master\u2019s attack from behind him. In a moment of desperation, Jian Chen rolled to the ground to evade, but even so, the great sword had landed a wound on his back, so deep that even the bone could be seen.\u201cHa!\u201d Seeing that he now had the upper hand, he raised his sword mercilessly once more to slash at Jian Chen.Feeling a burning sharp sensation in his back, Jian Chen bit his lip as his left hand hit the floor. His entire body immediately flew upwards. Then, his body slightly twisted to the side, barely dodging the second sword stroke from the man by a hair. However, his Light Wind Sword flashed like a bolt of lightning as it pierced towards the older mercenary at an extremely fast speed.The older man was alarmed. Since he had just swung his Saint Weapon, it was far too late for him to pull it back and defend himself. Forced by the desperate situation, the man tilted his head narrowly to dodge the sword piercing towards his throat. However, despite managing to dodge the fatal blow, the sword had still left a small nick on his neck that dripped with blood.With a grim smile, Jian Chen twisted his wrist to allow his Light Wind Sword to chase after the other man\u2019s neck once more, before the man could even react.Immediately after the silver Light Wind Sword flashed across the man\u2019s neck, his face became rigid as blood began to pulsate out of his neck in small waves.\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s eyes opened wide as he looked at Jian Chen in disbelief. He strained to lift his hand, finger slowly shaking as it pointed at Jian Chen. It seemed as if he wanted to say something, but the wound on his neck prevented him from doing so. In the end, the man wordlessly collapsed on the ground.Seeing the dead man, the remaining mercenaries could only be extremely shocked. They began to look at Jian Chen with expressions of extreme dread.Upon killing the middle aged man, Jian Chen didn\u2019t leave any time for the other mercenaries to catch their breaths. With his Light Wind Sword, he began to run towards the remaining people.Seeing Jian Chen approach, the single remaining Saint Master mercenary moved forward to block him. With a thrust, his long spear immediately disappeared and reappeared in a blur towards Jian Chen.The other Great Saint mercenaries had been intimidated by the death of the middle aged Saint Master, and were afraid of charging forward. The idea of retreating had already been planted within their hearts. If not for the other Saint Master level mercenary, then they would had already long since run away.\u201cDing ding ding\u2026\u201dA series of colliding sounds sung throughout the forest as Jian Chen and the 30 year old mercenary exchanged a dozen blows at a lightning fast speed in a brief moment. Now that there were no outside factors, Jian Chen\u2019s Sword Qi had swiftly helped him take the advantage and completely suppressed the other person. In the blink of an eye, the youth was forced onto the defensive.Because Jian Chen\u2019s swordplay was far too fast, the 30 year old mercenary didn\u2019t dare attack. Instead, he continued defending himself, reacting to Jian Chen\u2019s movements. He was afraid that if he were to try to attack, then Jian Chen would be able to swiftly use that moment to kill him before the man could even complete the attack.Not only that, but Jian Chen was fighting him at close range. The 30 year old mercenary wasn\u2019t able to show off the true power of his long spear at such a short distance, so he was left with the feeling of having one arm tied behind his back.After attaining the Great Saint level, Jian Chen\u2019s battle strength had improved several times over. So with his current strength, he could contend against those a level higher than him on equal footing.After a dozen high speed blows were exchanged, the two were finally split apart. However, the 30 year old man looked to be in a sorry state as his clothes were completely ruined by this point. A few parts of his body had deep looking wounds, and even his neck had a thin line from where Jian Chen had only barely cut apart the first layer of skin.As for Jian Chen, besides the single wound on his back, he didn\u2019t look very different. The only change was that his face had grown paler.Staring at Jian Chen with a hardened face, the 30 year old mercenary said, \u201cThe enemy is far too strong! I\u2019ll stall him while everyone else runs away!\u201d After fighting Jian Chen, the 30 year old mercenary knew how fast and strong Jian Chen was. In the mercenary\u2019s heart, he knew that it was possible he wouldn\u2019t be leaving here alive, so he had to take the worst plan of action for himself.He had realized another thing in his heart regarding the situation with the Silver Striped Golden Snake. For the sake of keeping this matter a secret, Jian Chen would definitely kill anyone that tried to leave this place. He wouldn\u2019t let anyone spread details about the situation. If it was the mercenary who was in this situation, he would have done the same thing.This was the rule for survival for the Tian Yuan Continent; everything was decided by the fist. Whoever was strongest would have the last laugh.Hearing these words, the remaining mercenaries all started a bit before immediately running away from the area in all directions.Seeing every mercenary scamper away, Jian Chen\u2019s face darkened. He slashed his sword to try to kill the man quickly.\u201cAh!\u201d The 30 year old mercenary let loose a battle cry as he moved towards Jian Chen without fear. Because of the speed Jian Chen demonstrated, the man knew that it was unlikely that he would be leaving here alive. Rather than dying with everyone else, he had decided that it was better to use his life to garner some time for everyone else. Once the news of the Silver Striped Golden Snake was leaked out, there would be no shortage of people to avenge him.\u201cDing!\u201dThe Light Wind Sword collided with the long spear once again, causing sparks to fly out between the two. Then, under the 30 year old mercenary\u2019s control, the sword was flipped on top of the spear and was immediately sent flying into the air as he performed a move on instinct.At this, the man looked on with shock. However, a joyous look soon appeared on his face as he immediately manipulated the spear to stab straight towards Jian Chen\u2019s throat.Jian Chen smiled in disdain as his palms suddenly filled with very strong Saint Force. Both palms disappeared into a blur, and his hands blurred as they shot out to grab onto the spear shaft tightly.At the same time, the Light Wind Sword that had been knocked into the air suddenly stopped, as it began to pulse out a shroud of Sword Qi that enveloped the sword. With a large glow, the Light Wind Sword traveled through the air quickly, like a flash of light, appearing as if it could cut open a space in the air. With an ear piercing whistle, the sword bore through the man\u2019s throat, disappearing into the nearby forest area.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dSuddenly, the loud cries of a few people could be heard from within the forests.The Soul Sword was Jian Chen\u2019s last resort. Until it was the final moment, Jian Chen would not use it easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The other mercenaries who had run off in all directions to escape had fallen one after another to Jian Chen\u2019s sword.The silver glow from the sword flashed as it shot towards Jian Chen. Holding his hand into the air, the sword immediately returned to its rightful place in his hands. As it smacked into his palms, a fierce amount of Sword Qi briefly shot out from the sword.A few moments after the Light Wind Sword returned to Jian Chen, the intense atmosphere coming from the sword suddenly disappeared without a trace. Soon after, the Light Wind Sword also slowly disappeared.\u201cHu\u2026\u201d Jian Chen let out a long breath of air. He had already fought two battles in a row; this wasn\u2019t an easy feat to do. After killing the Silver Striped Golden Snake and then killing the two Saint Master mercenaries, Jian Chen\u2019s internal Saint Force was all but gone. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that his Azulet Sword Law was a unique technique, his Saint Force would not have gained so many mystical effects. Without it, Jian Chen would have been unable to kill the Silver Striped Golden Snake, let alone fight another battle after it.Jian Chen shifted his body. Just as he began to move, the wound on his back immediately seared with hot pain. The muscles on Jian Chen\u2019s face twitched a few times due to the strong feeling of pain.\u201cThis really hurts!\u201d Jian Chen hissed under his breath. Wanting to move, his powerful Soul gathered a large amount of the Light Saint Force from the World Essence towards him. Slowly, a large indistinct white ball of light that had appeared around him began to slowly turn milky white. Although the light was dazzling, it was extremely warm, and did not hurt the eyes at all.Bathing in the glow of the milky white light, Jian Chen\u2019s figure became so indistinct within the glow that it was hard to see him. Even the deep cut on his back was quickly healing itself under the energy of the Light Saint Force.Under this Light Saint Force, a comfortable and refreshing feeling spontaneously arose from his chest, and quickly spread throughout his entire body. It bypassed Jian Chen\u2019s self-control, and he could barely hold himself back from ** .Although he had already used the Light Saint Force before while trying to resist the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s venom, his attention had been stretched thinly at that time, so he hadn\u2019t noticed the feeling of happiness the Light Saint Force had brought to him. But now that he could fully focus, Jian Chen finally realized how much of a pleasure the Light Saint Force could give.The Light Saint Force continued on for a while before gradually disappearing, showing Jian Chen\u2019s body once more.Jian Chen twisted his arm behind his back to feel the wound that was previously there, but he could only feel smooth skin. Although the shirt he was wearing was moist with blood, he didn\u2019t feel any type of pain, and not a hint of a scar could be found.Nodding his head in satisfaction, Jian Chen began to smile at the miraculous results the light Saint Force had shown. With a skill like this, Jian Chen\u2019s ability to save his own life would be even more bountiful on the Tian Yuan Continent from now on.Just then, a dizzy sensation struck Jian Chen as the world seemed to sway twice for him. The dizzy spell was over in a moment only to be replaced with a wave of exhaustion. At that moment, Jian Chen felt that he had not slept for a whole day and night, and was in a very serious state of weariness. Jian Chen wanted to just find a bed and sleep in it right then.\u201cWhat a pity, the Soul Sword and the light Saint Force brings about such a high energy consumption. Right now my soul is evidently all used up.\u201d Jian Chen gloomily sighed to himself. He knew that in the future, he would have to refrain from using the Soul Sword and light Saint Force too much. Otherwise, if he ran out of soul in the future, it would majorly affect his fighting strength.Fortunately, while his soul was for the most part exhausted, it was not at a critical point yet, so his fighting strength was not impacted by that much.Taking out an intact set of clothes from within his Space Belt, Jian Chen looked at the few mercenaries on the ground. Looking at the Space Belts on their waists, anticipation flashed through Jian Chen\u2019s eyes.\u201cI hope there\u2019s a few good things in them.\u201d Jian Chen thought to himself. On the Tian Yuan Continent, a majority of people generally put all of their valuables within their Space Belts. It could be said that a single Space Belt could contain a person\u2019s life savings. Of course, many weaker mercenaries were very poor, and so they wouldn\u2019t have much in their Space Belts.Walking past the mercenaries without touching their Space Belts, Jian Chen quickly walked up to the Silver Striped Golden Snake and put it in his Space Ring.Since the Silver Striped Golden Snake was huge, it had taken Jian Chen the same amount of time it took for a candle wick to burn to store the snake in the Space Ring. Placing the Space Ring within the folds of his inner robes once more, Jian Chen let loose a breath in relaxation as an inconcealable feeling of joy took hold.\u201cAn unpoisonable body!\u201d Recollections of the good benefits of the Ten Thousand Immunity came flashing back into Jian Chen\u2019s head. Right now. he had the body of the Silver Striped Golden Snake. And although he had swallowed a good amount of the snake\u2019s blood, the rest of it was still within the body of the snake. It could be said that given enough time, Jian Chen could take the Silver Striped Golden Snake\u2019s blood and gall bladder and refine them to gain an unpoisonable body.Slowly calming down his heart, Jian Chen walked towards the bodies of the mercenaries once more and removed their Space Belts. Making sure they didn\u2019t have any additional items, he departed from the area and disappeared into the forest.Once Jian Chen was far enough, he found an empty spot to sit down with his legs crossed.. He then took out the 20 Space Belts, and began to look through them.The items within the Space Belts were numerous; a good majority of them were essentials that were needed to survive within the Tian Yuan Continent. Comforters, tents, food and water accounted for half of the items, while the rest were all items of little worth. There were pitiful amounts of silver and copper coins stacked on top of each other within the Space Belts, but Jian Chen did not feel inclined to take such a trifle amount.After going through quite a few of the Space Belts, Jian Chen still couldn\u2019t find any items of value. The Space Belts only had items for everyday use like bandages and herbs\u2013there wasn\u2019t even a single Class 1 Monster Core to be seen.Jian Chen didn\u2019t have a surprised look on his face, since he knew that these mercenaries were here in the Magical Beast Mountain Range to earn a profit in the first place. To be trying to earn money in such a place could only mean that they were poor; the most valuable items they could possibly have would be a few low leveled monster cores.After going through half of the Space Belts, Jian Chen finally found one that had a small pile of around a dozen monster cores, but they were all pretty much Class 1 or Class 2.Taking the monster cores from the Space Belt, Jian Chen continued to look through the rest of the Space Belts.Quickly, Jian Chen had finished looking through the 20 Space Belts and casually tossed them to the side. Turning his head back to look at the small pile of monster cores and money, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t help but have a look of helplessness.From the 20 Space Belts, he had only collected around 20 monster cores and almost 100 Gold Coins. Among those 20 monster cores, there was a single Class 3 Monster Core, 6 Class 2 Monster Cores, and the rest were only Class 1 Monster Cores.Not knowing if he should laugh or cry, Jian Chen shook his head and said with a bitter smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t this profit way too low? There were two Saint Masters within the group and yet they still have only this pitiful amount of monster cores. I could get more by myself in a single day.\u201d Storing the gold coins and monster cores within his own Space Belt, Jian Chen left the area.The following day, Jian Chen drifted through the depths of the Magical Beast Forest. However after being chased by the Silver Striped Golden Snake, he was already very close to the abyss of the Magical Beast Mountain Range. The majority of the magical beasts here would be at the Class 3 level, and a very few of them would be at the Class 2 level.Compared to the Great Saint leveled Jian Chen, Class 3 Magical Beasts were no longer as much of a threat as they once were. Although it took some more effort to kill them, the profits here would be greater since there were more Class 3 Magical Beasts than Class 2 Magical Beasts. A single Class 3 Monster Core had the same amount of energy as ten Class 2 Monster Cores, and even the purity of the energy within the core was better than the Class 2 Monster Core. They were necessary for Jian Chen to use to cultivate, as 3 Class 3 Monster Cores would most likely take him the entire night with his terribly fast rate of consumption.In the blink of an eye, Jian Chen had spent another ten days in the forest where he hunted for magical beasts in the day and cultivated in isolation at night. After those 10 days, Jian Chen\u2019s strength had improved by leaps and bounds. Although he was still at the Primary Great Saint level, he could clearly sense that he was not all that far away from the Middle Great Saint level.During these 10 days, Jian Chen would spend each day walking through the mountains carefully with one of the Class 3 Monster Cores in hand. At one point, Jian Chen had come across a Class 4 Magical Beast, but it was far too strong for him to fight against. After a dozen blows, Jian Chen had escaped while suffering from a serious injury. From that point on, Jian Chen had recognized the strength of a Class 4 Magical Beast, so he continued to fight against Class 3 Magical Beasts instead. Afterwards, whenever he encountered a Class 4 Magical Beast, he would just run away immediately without provoking it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Chaotic Sword GodCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: A Lucky Encounter With a Woman by the RiverHighlight above for chapter titleOver the course of those 10 days, Jian Chen had hunted many Class 3 Magical Beasts. Although there weren\u2019t as many beasts as when he had hunted in Kargath Forest, the profits he had received were still high. He had about 20 Class 3 Monster Cores, which was only a little bit more than how many Class 2 Monster Cores he had. Considering how fast he had initially cultivated the 3 Class 3 Monster Cores from before, he would probably finish cultivating the rest of the cores in around seven days.What Jian Chen didn\u2019t know however, was that since he was traveling alone in the Magical Beast Mountain Range, magical beasts would come upon him more frequently than if he was in a large group of mercenaries. This was because many magical beasts on the mountain range had an extremely sensitive sense of smell and high vigilance. Since they had lived their entire lives on the mountain range, their ability to track footprints was remarkable, and so if they had come across a strong group with many footprints, then the magical beasts would carefully run far away from them. So although the magical beasts did not have any intellect, their honed survival had ingrained themselves deep within their minds.But if they were to come across a weak or single person that they were sure they could kill and eat, then the previously hiding magical beasts would come out and search for that person. They wouldn\u2019t need to use an extraordinary amount of energy to chase after and hunt their prey, so since Jian Chen was by himself in this place, the chance of encountering a magical beast was greatly increased.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Jian Chen\u2019s \u201cSpirit\u201d was strong enough to detect movements around him, he would had been beaten black and blue by the sneak attacks from some magical beasts.The next day, the crosslegged Jian Chen finally opened his eyes as he awoke from his cultivation on top of a tree branch, and jumped down onto the ground. Dusting himself off, he took a look at the monster cores he had stored within his Space Belt. During this short amount of time, he had collected a decent amount of monster cores, and even though he had used many cores to cultivate, his Space Ring still had plenty of cores in stock.\u201cThere are still 50 Class 2 Monster Cores and 120 Class 3 Monster Cores.\u201d Checking the inventory within the Space Belt, Jian Chen nodded his head in satisfaction. Currently he was using 20 Class 2 Monster Cores to cultivate with per night, and his Space Belt only had enough for two days worth of cultivation at most. All of the other monster cores added together would last for over 10 days.\u201cEh, I still have 2 Class 4 Monster Cores; one is from the prize given by Kargath Academy, and another is what father gave to me. Since the Class 4 Monster Core has way more energy inside it than a Class 3 Monster Core has, I don\u2019t know how long a single Class 4 Monster Core will last me.\u201d Jian Chen thought. He didn\u2019t realize that the amount of monster cores within his possession was considered a massive pile of wealth. To Jian Chen, it was just a way to sustain his cultivation for a mere 10 days.Looking up at the bright sun overhead, he immediately discerned his location and began to walk off towards the outskirts of the Magical Beast Mountain Range without even stopping to eat breakfast.By this point, the amount of time Jian Chen had spent in the mountain range was quite long. The monster cores in his Space Ring were more than enough for him to cultivate with for a few days, but the supplies he had on hand were about to run out. So for that reason, Jian Chen needed to return to Wake City to replenish his supplies. Not only that, but he also needed to handle the Silver Striped Golden Snake within his Space Ring; otherwise if left alone long enough, who knew what type of situation would occur? For example, the body might rot away. Jian Chen wasn\u2019t too sure about such things, since he hadn\u2019t read about them in the books. So for the sake of achieving his goal, Jian Chen wanted to get the Silver Striped Golden Snake matter over with as soon as possible.Throughout the mountain range was the scent of bloodshed, something magical beasts were especially sensitive to. It would be incredibly unwise if he were to keep the body of the Silver Striped Golden Snake here, so Jian Chen decided to take it back to Wake City and plan from there.The Magical Beast Mountain Range had plenty of dense tall grass and just as many swamps. It was hard to detect them just by looking, but as Jian Chen traveled on the road, he kept an eye out everywhere. During the past days he had spent in the mountain range, he had already sunk into the swamps a few times before ultimately escaping from them.Under the guidance of the blazing sun, Jian Chen managed to leave the Magical Beast Mountain Range without deviating from the path too much. After walking for two days, he finally exited the depths of the mountain range and entered the flat lands of the forest. Within those two days, Jian Chen\u2019s Space Belt had gained even more Class 2 Monster Cores.Taking in a deep breath of the fresh air within the forest, Jian Chen tilted his head to look at the clothes he had fashioned from animal hides with a grim smile. With his current appearance, he looked like a beggar. It was a shame that there wasn\u2019t much water within the mountain range, making it impossible for Jian Chen to wash the stink off of himself.Jian Chen hadn\u2019t forgotten about the river at the outskirts of the forest. Throwing off his animal hide clothes, he leapt into the depths of the water and began to cleanse himself of the grime he had collected.The amount of body odor and dirt he had amassed over the past days had already covered his body like armor, making him feel sick everytime he moved. He wasn\u2019t comfortable at all with the sticky yet greasy feeling on his skin, but he had felt restraint while in the Magical Beast Mountain Range. Yet as soon as the river came into view, he had immediately thrown off that restraint and leapt into the water.Jian Chen wrapped the Space Belt around his neck as he began to knead at his entire body. His arms continued to rub everywhere as the water nearby him began turn black with contamination.Even after washing himself in the river, he didn\u2019t leave the waters. Instead, he floated on his back and slowly closed his eyes, allowing the river to wash over him. For the first time in a long time, his mind was at rest as he relaxed under the pleasure of the icy cold waters. The past few days had been taxing on his mind, as he traveled within the mountain range. Now that his mind was at rest, the very depths of his soul felt free, letting Jian Chen finally sleep in peace.Jian Chen closed his eyes as he laid back in the water and took a gentle bath from the cold water from the river and the warm rays from the sun. His naked body bobbed up and down the river as he floated along with the waves.As the river flowed, he began to float towards the direction of Wake City, letting Jian Chen have a free ride for a while. So while he was traveling for free, he could take in a bit of enjoyment from the ride.After a while, Jian Chen completely lost track of time. He didn\u2019t know how long it had been since he was traveling down the river, but at that moment, Jian Chen\u2019s head bumped into something soft. The moment he felt contact, Jian Chen was brought back to awareness and focused on whatever he had hit. Whatever he had hit, it was moving.\u201cAn animal!\u201d Jian Chen thought in his drowsy state of mind. In an instant, he sobered up and reactivated his \u201cSpirit\u201d to an active level. The surrounding environment became known to Jian Chen as he instantly changed from sluggish state to his concentrated state. His previously closed eyes snapped wide open to reveal his bright eyes. Immediately, he flipped his body over from his laid back position to be on his legs. The water rose to his waist, leaving only the top half of his body above the water.As he completed that action, the face of a person came into view. It was the face of a woman that could cause a city to fight over her and could even be considered to be a snowy white face of perfection. The five facial features on her face were perfectly matched up to the point that even a picky person wouldn\u2019t be able to find a fault within them. She was like a fairy that had descended onto the mortal world.The woman did not look all that old, roughly around ** years old. Within her sparkling white eyes were beautiful and dark pupils, she sluggishly stared back at Jian Chen\u2019s eyes. Below, her considerably big ** were exposed to the air, and were only separated from Jian Chen by a narrow margin.\u201cWhat terrible luck! To think that there was a woman taking a bath here.\u201d Jian Chen thought immediately as his face began to darken. Thanks to his previous experiences, he knew just what was happening here.He didn\u2019t think that while drifting away on the river to relax after wandering the Magical Beast Mountain Range, he would stumble across a woman bathing in the very same river he was in.\u201cAh!\u201dJust as Jian Chen realized what was happening, the small eyes of the woman in front of him opened wide as she too realized what had just happened, and a scream came out of her mouth.\u201cYou stinking scoundrel!\u201dHer previously sluggish eyes turned red hot with anger and shame as she screamed and swung her arm rapidly at Jian Chen\u2019s chest.\u201cBang!\u201dBefore Jian Chen could even react, the woman\u2019s palm had already hit his chest with a muffled sound. Jian Chen was then sent flying backwards over the waters as a small stream of blood came pouring out of his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A look of astonishment flashed through Jian Chen\u2019s eyes as he felt the strong energy from her hand. That single strike had caused a decent injury on him, as the bones where she had hit started to hurt as if something heavy had smashed into it.Jian Chen\u2019s arm paddled through the water briefly before he leapt into the forests on the opposite side of the river. Hiding behind a broad tree, he used his Saint Force to evaporate the water droplets on him before taking the Space Ring from his necklace. With a simple motion, he pulled out the last intact piece of clothing and put it on.Just as Jian Chen put on his robes, his already pale face froze momentarily before leaping towards the side in a hurry.\u201cBang!\u201dJust as Jian Chen dodged to the side, the tree he had previously been hiding in exploded into splinters as a tremendous amount of pure Saint Force exploded on over. As it landed where Jian Chen was once at, the dirt around it was sent flying as a huge crater was left behind in the impact zone.\u201cYou scoundrel, to think that you would peek at me taking a bath, I will definitely kill you!\u201dThere was a small mournful tone mixed in within her angry words as her face grew redder by the second in front of Jian Chen. Her jade like white hands carried a blue colored Saint Force before flying at Jian Chen so fast that it whistled through the air.Feeling the huge amount of Saint Force within her palm, Jian Chen\u2019s face changed rapidly and became abnormally solemn. Gathering up the Saint Force within himself, he concentrated it in his right hand and lashed out.\u201cBang!\u201dThe two palms collided against each other with a muffled explosion as the shockwave flew out in all directions. Jian Chen was sent flying backwards violently, crashing through various bushes before finally slumping to the ground.\u201cPff!\u201d A mouthful of blood splashed out from Jian Chen\u2019s mouth and formed a small bloody mist for a brief moment. As it escaped from his mouth, his face grew deathly pale.With difficulty, Jian Chen tilted his head upwards in disbelief at the woman in front of him. She wasn\u2019t too far away from Jian Chen\u2019s age and yet she had such an unbelievably strong amount of strength, he had estimated that she possessed Great Saint Master strength at the very least. This was deduced by the fact that Jian Chen knew his own strength like the back of his hand, especially after fighting against Saint Masters while in the Magical Beast Mountain Range. With his current strength, even Saint Masters wouldn\u2019t be able to contend against him. So the woman right in front of him was an unbelievably strong opponent that he wasn\u2019t able to defeat with ease with his current strength.\u201cGreat Saint Master!\u201d Jian Chen swallowed nervously. To think that the woman in front of him was actually that strong, Jian Chen couldn\u2019t believe it. In Kargath Academy, where every single gifted individual of Gesun Kingdom was gathered, there were still quite a number of young women of the same age as the woman in front of him that weren\u2019t even able to condense the Saint Weapon to promote into the Saint level.The woman slowly walked towards Jian Chen with the beauty of an immortal that could almost be said to be unmatched within the world. Her beautiful eyes were filled with shame and indignation, her fury slowly tearing away her charm. Covered with a strong killing intent as she gave the death glare towards Jian Chen, it looked as if she had wanted nothing more but to make mincemeat out of him.The woman wore a pink leather robe that was rather messy. It was clear to see that she had thrown it on quickly without sparing enough time to smooth herself out. Her long hair was draped behind her shoulder and clung to her waist as water droplets slowly made contact with her robes. With her pink slippers that made no sound as she walked, the lady walked towards Jian Chen slowly with a blue colored sword in hand. Seeing the sword with such a color, Jian Chen\u2019s face changed.With difficulty, Jian Chen slowly crawled up from the ground as his right hand began to tremble. The woman was surely very strong, in a single blow, Jian Chen\u2019s right arm had already suffered from such a critical blow.Controlling the light Saint Force within the air, Jian Chen had made sure that the healing effects of the light Saint Force couldn\u2019t be seen by his opponent first. When it came to the special attribute that was the light Saint Force, he did not want anyone to know about the milky white glow or healing abilities.\u201cHold on, miss! This was just a misunderstanding, I had no intentions on peeking on the miss taking a bath!\u201d Jian Chen laughed, the power of the lady\u2019s strength had amazed him.\u201cYou scoundrel, just shut up for me!\u201d The woman\u2019s beautiful face turned ashen as she heard Jian Chen. It was clear to see that she was not feeling better, and so with a single stride, her pink shoe lashed out at Jian Chen\u2019s groin.Jian Chen\u2019s body swayed to the side by this and dodged it by a narrow margin. Soon after that moment, she turned around and chopped at Jian Chen with her blue colored sword.The blue sword was traveling fast, and in a blink of an eye, it was already by Jian Chen\u2019s figure. Seeing this, Jian Chen began to turn around but despite this, there was still a large sword wound that appeared on Jian Chen\u2019s chest. Blood began to fly out like a fountain as it flowed from his body violently; in a flash, Jian Chen\u2019s newest pair of clothing had been dyed red with blood.Unable to realize he was cut, a burning sensation began to swell up within Jian Chen as he realized there was pain happening. Quickly, he began to gain some distance from her while letting the slender form of the Light Wind Sword appear within his hand. Although Jian Chen had chanced upon the sight of her naked body, this was not on purpose. He had already apologized three or four times, but the lady was still so angry and calling for his death, this brought about no small amount of anger from her.The young woman did not plan on letting Jian Chen go at all and chased after him.Her blue sword carried a type of Saint Force that seemed to sound like waves as it slashed towards Jian Chen.Jian Chen let loose a groan as his eyes flashed with an icy cold glare. Despite the lady being stronger, he wasn\u2019t the type of person to sit around and wait to be captured. With the wave of his hand, the Light Wind Sword sprung into action. In a streak of silver, the sword attacked at the throat of the would be murderer.The sword was already going as fast as it possibly could, but the strength of his opponent wasn\u2019t so great that he would not dare try to block the attack. He would do whatever it takes to win, even if his opponent was a girl, Jian Chen didn\u2019t hesitate at all.Just as the blue sword was about to make contact with Jian Chen again, he twisted his body and caused the sword to narrowly scrape against his armpit. Jian Chen on the other hand already had his sword pointed at her throat.At that moment, the lady let loose an expression full of panic as she gave a small shout. Immediately turning his neck, she had dodged Jian Chen\u2019s stab at her throat, but despite all that, there was a thin line of blood that leaked out from the small wound the sword had made.Feeling a small pain in her neck, the lady had a small expression of panic as her beautiful eyes finally began to reveal the tiniest amount of fear.Seeing this, Jian Chen began to smile inwardly. Although the woman was strong, she did not have have enough combat experience, so in this fight, she was at a disadvantage.However, Jian Chen didn\u2019t plan on letting the woman go either. Feeling the sharp burning pain inflicted onto him by her, Jian Chen\u2019s Light Wind Sword became indistinct as it chased after the woman.The woman\u2019s face grew even more panicked as the Light Wind Sword began to pierce through her body. Suddenly, the woman\u2019s body suddenly disappeared from Jian Chen\u2019s line of sight before reappearing 10 meters away for some strange reason, as if it was some sort of magic trick.Jian Chen\u2019s heart trembled as he watched the girl reappear 10 meters away from him. But when he saw that the girl\u2019s face was paling, it looked like it had taken a great amount of energy to use such a fast movement technique.\u201cCould it be this is a special type of battle skill?!\u201d Jian Chen thought.\u201cYou scoundrel, to think you would raise your hand against a woman, this one will not let you go!\u201dTo be put in such a state by a weaker person, the girl was furious. After yelling at Jian Chen, the blue colored sword in her hand began to glow brighter as all of the Saint Force within her surged out and pulsed around the sword.The woman raised her sword and yelled, \u201cFirst Form of the Imperial Water Arts\u2013Water Dragon Strike!\u201d As she spoke, the concentrated amount of Saint Force within her sword took on the form of a dragon almost instantaneously before breaking away from the sword and charged at Jian Chen.Jian Chen\u2019s face changed the very moment he saw the blurry form of the dragon come out from the sword. When the dragon came into view, Jian Chen had felt a strong sense of pressure, making him feel like he was carrying a thousand pound rock on his back. Just breathing was already a heavy task, let alone dodging.His face changed even more drastically as he realized his current situation. The only way to defend himself against this water dragon was to dodge, but he was incapable of doing so. He knew that the amount of Saint Force within the water dragon was strong enough that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take it without it inflicting serious damage.\u201cSuch a threatening person, don\u2019t blame me if I treat you badly!\u201d Jian Chen\u2019s eyes glinted dangerously as Sword Qi began to swirl around his sword once more. Once fully enveloped, the sword lifted off from Jian Chen\u2019s hands and shot towards the woman at such a speed that even the naked eye would have difficulty spotting it. When the woman saw the sword coming at her, the wound on her neck began to sting faintly.The lady grew pale with fright, the secret technique she had used to dodge Jian Chen\u2019s blow earlier had taken up a lot of energy as well as with the water dragon. Right now her internal Saint Force was practically empty, so she wasn\u2019t able to dodge the sword.Desperately, she commanded the water dragon to come back and block the incoming sword. Immediately, the water dragon turned around and chased after the Light Wind Sword. Opening up its giant jaw, it snapped at the Light Wind Sword.However, the Light Wind Sword was incomparably faster than the dragon. As the jaws of the water dragon snapped shut, it only tasted air as the sword was now just a meter away from the lady\u2019s neck.\u201cOutrageous, to have the audacity to raise a hand against the young miss!\u201dAt this critical moment, a furious aged man came flying from the skies, shouting in a loud tone that echoed throughout the area. The figure of a large man flew out and stood in front of the woman, blocking the Light Wind Sword.This was an elderly man around the age of **, with a large build that seemed to have a height of two meters tall. He wore a white robe that had his hair trailing behind him with a jade ring holding it in place. His sharp eyes with matching white eyebrows had made him look like a very sharp individual.Seeing the Light Wind Sword travel towards him, the elderly man couldn\u2019t help but have a look of disdain. With a sneer, he lifted his powerful looking right arm into the air and caught the blade in between his two fingers. Despite the strong amount of Sword Qi, it had not damaged the elderly man at all.Right after, the elder waved his other arm at the incoming water dragon, causing it to stop suddenly. In the next moment, the water dragon started to dissipate before dispersing into the Qi of the world.\u201cUncle Feng, help me kill him quickly!\u201d Seeing the arrival of the elderly man, the woman\u2019s face no longer had a look of terror, instead, the lovely tone returned to her speech as she spoke angrily as if she was wronged by Jian Chen.The elderly man didn\u2019t pay attention to her, instead, his eyes gazed at the Light Wind Sword that was stopped by him with a small amount of astonishment. Tilting his head to look at Jian Chen, he said, \u201cWhat is your name, and who is your master?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Help me kill him!\u201d The girl cried out behind him with a furious glare in her eyes. Already, her eyes were tearing up from the thought that Jian Chen had seen her body in its full glory. Indeed, just thinking about how she was naked in front of Jian Chen had caused her to be angry beyond belief, causing her to also feel wronged. This was the first time since she was born that she was seen by a man like this, and it was by a stranger. For the conservative lady, this type of outcome was worse than death.\u201cHaha, young miss, although your uncle Feng is unwilling to help out, then let your uncle Yun come help teach this daring bully a lesson.\u201d At that moment, another voice came into the clearing as another white robed elderly man came into view. Appearing in front of Jian Chen, he waved his fist for a brief moment before striking at Jian Chen\u2019s chest.The elder\u2019s strength was unbelievably profound, in that one fist, Jian Chen didn\u2019t doubt that it was extremely strong. Immediately dodging towards the side, Jian Chen suddenly felt a large amount of pressure on his body. The pressure was so large that it felt as if his entire body was burdened with a thousand pound weight, or even a mountain. Breathing was already a difficult task, his entire body felt like it was about to be crushed.Just at the moment when the pressure was at its heaviest, the azure and violet glow in his dantian began to flicker rapidly. However, while his dantian was undergoing such a state, Jian Chen himself did not notice.\u201cOld man Yun, hold on a moment!\u201d The first elder named Uncle Feng by the lady cried out as his face changed rapidly.Unfortunately, he had spoken too late. The one named Uncle Yun looked at his fist as it struck Jian Chen\u2019s chest precisely.A mouthful of blood escaped his mouth as he felt his internal organs get damaged, the elder had smashed Jian Chen\u2019s chest hard enough to leave a dent in it. Not only did the elder break Jian Chen\u2019s bones where he was hit, but even his internal organs were just as heavily damaged.In the moment the elder had attacked Jian Chen, the weak azure and violet\u00a0glow flickered as it made contact with the elder\u2019s palm before instantly disappearing. Jian Chen on the other hand was sent flying back.\u201cYi!\u201d The elder\u2019s face changed as he gave a small start. Looking at Jian Chen fly into the air with an flabbergasted face, his eyes contained a glint of disbelief and astonishment.Jian Chen flew 30 meters into the air before crashing into the ground with a large bang. As he laid on the ground, he spat out a large mouthful of blood as he felt the pain from his ruptured organs. Already his face was as white as a sheet of paper from the lack of blood, even his face was lax.Seeing Jian Chen barely alive, the one named Uncle Yun started to blink slowly before opening his mouth to say, \u201cYoungster, you have such a strong vitality if you can take one of my blows without dying. Fine then, today I will let you go.\u201d With that said, the one called Uncle Yun walked back towards the woman.\u201cAi, I hope there won\u2019t be anymore disturbances.\u201d The elder behind the woman said. The one called Uncle Feng waved his hand and sent the Light Wind Sword stuck between his fingers back towards Jian Chen. As it made contact with him, it disappeared from sight.\u201cYoung miss, let us leave now.\u201d The one named Uncle Feng said loudly as a large flying magical beast descended, landing near the three.The woman\u2019s anger wasn\u2019t completely satisfied however. Turning her head back, she said, \u201cUncle Feng, that person isn\u2019t dead yet, that won\u2019t do. I want him dead today.\u201d She walked towards Jian Chen with her sword ready to strike, it was clear that she did not want Jian Chen to get away with seeing her bathe.\u201cYoung miss, don\u2019t make such trouble.\u201d Uncle Feng stood in front to block the girl from moving closer to Jian Chen.\u201cUncle Feng!\u201d The woman argued. She had still felt wronged to the point of tearing in the eyes, almost ready to cry at any moment.\u201cYoung miss, don\u2019t be so unruly. It\u2019s getting late, so we should get going now.\u201d The elder behind her spoke flatly. With a wave of his hands, a large ball of Saint Force enveloped the lady and placed her on top of the flying magical beast.On top of the flying magical beast, the lady stamped her feet in anger at the elder who put her there, \u201cUncle Yun, why aren\u2019t you spoiling Luan Er?\u201dThe two elders looked at each other in the eye with a look of helplessness. Stepping onto the flying magical beast, they immediately took off from the ground with a large gust of wind, sending them flying into the horizon.In midair, the lady stood on top of the back of the flying magical beast and glared down at the rapidly shrinking figure of Jian Chen. In her eyes was a look of anger that would never dissipate.\u201cUncle Feng, Uncle Yun, what is going on with you two? How could you let that scoundrel go?\u201d She stamped her foot in angry grievance. The mist in her eyes had already become tears that threatened to fall off of her eyelashes.Hearing that, the one named Uncle Feng sighed, judging by how wet and disorderly her hair was, he already knew what had happened to her.\u201cYoung miss, that man is quite complicated. Right now the clan is under a great deal of pressure, at this critical moment, it is best to avoid to make new enemies just in case they bring a new source of trouble to the clan.\u201d Uncle Feng said helplessly.\u201cUncle Feng, since when were you a coward afraid of death? That scoundrel\u2019s strength was weak, how could you think that he could be a threat to our clan?\u201d The lady said angrily.\u201cYoung miss, that man really isn\u2019t simple, it\u2019s best not to offend anyone. Although his power is quite weak, but the person behind him is definitely strong.\u201d Said the one who first struck out at Jian Chen, Uncle Yun with a solemn but worried face. Then, he lifted his cloth-wrapped hand to show the two deep wounds on his right hand. Although the blood had stopped, the elder\u2019s right hand could still be seen as having two wounds that went from the hollow of his palm to the back of it as if a sword had cut through it.When the lady saw the injured hand of the elder, her cherry red lips opened wide along with her eyes in disbelief. \u201cUncle Yun! You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re injured!\u201d She cried out in astonishment.The one named Uncle Feng started before saying, \u201cOld man Yun, how unexpected for you to be injured.\u201dUncle Yun nodded his head slowly, \u201cThis wound was given to me by that 20 year old youth.\u201d\u201cHow is this possible, Uncle Yun. You have to be joking. The scoundrel\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t strong at all, if he couldn\u2019t even beat me, how would he be able to harm you?\u201d She bounded forward in shock.\u201cOld man Yun, how did you get such a wound like this?\u201d Uncle Feng said with doubt.Uncle Yun could only look back at the other with a blank face, \u201cI don\u2019t know that either. When I attacked him earlier, I felt a pain in my palm and then I saw the wound. Whatever had hurt me, I don\u2019t know.\u201dHearing this, Uncle Yun gave a gasp, \u201cThis youngster really is complicated. From the moment I saw his Saint Weapon, I knew that it would stand out from the masses; his Saint Weapon wasn\u2019t like everyone else\u2019s. Whatever happened within him, it made his Saint Weapon even stronger, even his strength isn\u2019t matching up with what is expected.\u201dThe woman was left stunned by Uncle Yun\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we didn\u2019t kill him, otherwise the one standing behind him would be a huge bother for our clan if they stepped forward. Right now we can only hope the ones supporting him won\u2019t be too strong, or that this person had only inherited some techniques from his ancestors.\u201d\u2026\u2026By the riverside, Jian Chen laid down on the ground with blood dying his clothes red. The elder\u2019s fist had caused serious damage to Jian Chen, the bones in his chest were crushed, and his organs suffered extreme trauma. Right now, aside from being fully conscious, Jian Chen was powerless to move. It could be said that ever since Jian Chen was born, this was the most serious damage he had suffered. If it was not for the fact he had used a unique way to cultivate and had refined his body in ways that far outstripped others, the elder\u2019s hand would have sent him to a messy death.The Light Saint Force from the World Essence began to surge and condense towards Jian Chen. Quickly, Jian Chen was enveloped within the milky white glow and had it absorbed into every single pore of his body. With that, Jian Chen was beginning to recover at a very fast rate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Chaotic Sword GodCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Returning to Wake CityThe Light Saint Force within the World Essence gathered within Jian Chen and quickly began to heal him. However Jian Chen\u2019s wounds were too serious, so even with the miraculous healing effects of the light Saint Force, it took a long time for Jian Chen to recover.Controlling the light Saint Force had taken up a lot of Jian Chen\u2019s spirit. After four hours, he had used up almost all of his spirit, causing him to stop. Right now, he was suffering from major blood loss as well as a dizzying headache. He was also very exhausted and desired sleep, it was almost as if he hadn\u2019t slept for three days and three nights and was almost unconscious.After healing himself for four hours, his inner body was healed by a little less than half his original strength. His inner organs had been treated by the Light Saint Force, and although it wasn\u2019t completely healed, the injured parts had been regrown. All that was left was the fractured bones on his chest that were slightly more troublesome than his organs.Regarding the serious injuries on his chest, the fractured bones had already pierced into his flesh. So whenever Jian Chen moved even the tiniest bit, the wounds on his chest would make Jian Chen feel even more pain. The pain was so intense that the signals his brain was receiving were practically torturing it. Slowly reclining on the grass, he closed his eyes and slowly started to use the rest of his spirit to heal himself. However, Jian Chen had fortunately memorized the entirety of the contents of the Azulet Sword Law, the method of \u201cRecuperation\u201d, With the \u201cRecuperation\u201d method, he could slowly regain his spirit.Jian Chen laid there on the grass for a whole day and night. Without moving his body a single time, his eyes had remained closed for just as long.The time quickly passed by as the afternoon approached. The blazing hot rays of the sun were slowly becoming moderately warm as it left the mountains.At that moment, the stone like Jian Chen finally opened his eyes. After a full day and night of healing, the spirit he had used up was finally replenished.Seeing the color of the sky, Jian Chen didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment and began to gather the light Saint Force. Rapidly, he began to heal his chest once more.As the light Saint Force entered his chest, pieces of the fractured bones had begun to reattach themselves and heal. For another four hours without stopping, Jian Chen\u2019s spirit was finally used up once more.However, after four hours of healing, Jian Chen\u2019s chest was finally fully recovered. However, Jian Chen\u2019s spirit wasn\u2019t recovered yet and affected his mobility, so Jian Chen sat back down on the grass cross legged and began to use the recuperation method to recover the lost spirit.Although it wasn\u2019t too far from Wake City, but considering that the use of the Light Saint Force was far too conspicuous with its dazzling glow and that healing in Wake City was too inconvenient, no one would be able to detect the Light Saint Force except for Radiant Saint Masters. However, who would be able to guarantee that there was a Radiant Saint Master within the vicinity of Wake City? Radiant Saint Masters were rare within the Tian Yuan Continent, so many people would fail to find and invite one to help themselves. Jian Chen thought that if he were to reveal his ability to use Light Saint Force like Radiant Saint Masters, then he would get no small amount of glory and would never have to worry about a shortage of monster cores. However, Jian Chen didn\u2019t want to reveal that he could mimic the Radiant Saint Master\u2019s ability to use Light Saint Force because his intuition told him that if he were to keep it a secret for now, then it would definitely help him out in the future.After three full days of continuous healing, Jian Chen\u2019s body was finally back to full health. Upon getting up, he immediately left for the official road back to Wake City.The official road was filled with caravans escorted by groups of armed yet blood soaked mercenaries. Although Jian Chen was a lone traveler, no one paid extra attention to him. Despite his bloody clothes from the wounds he gained, to every single mercenary within the Tian Yuan Continent, this was a very common sight to see. Practically every mercenary had seen these types of things every day.Walking on the roadway, Jian Chen thought back to the event from three days ago, especially the beautiful girl and her naked body that had appeared right in front of him. This was a sight that had left a deep effect on Jian Chen because even in his previous life, he had never had an experience like it before. Three days ago was the first time he had ever seen the jade like body of a woman to this extent, and this girl\u2019s body was almost as if it belonged to an Immortal.However, when Jian Chen had thought about the lady\u2019s gigantic strength, his heart still couldn\u2019t quite believe it. The girl looked to be 18 years old, 20 years old at the oldest. The age difference between her and Jian Chen was almost non existent, but to be a Great Saint Master at this age, Jian Chen could only blush with shame at her innate talent.Soon enough, Jian Chen entered Wake City and waited for the city guards to come and inspect him. Since he had the image of a injured and bloody survivor, there was no monetary tax to enter the city. Although the guards were greedy for money, their greed was not without morals.Upon entering Wake City, Jian Chen didn\u2019t take a stroll and immediately headed towards an inn. Once he got a room, Jian Chen began to cultivate. Although it had been less than a month ago that he had broken through to become a Great Saint, his strength was still not strong enough to protect himself within the Tian Yuan Continent. Not only did the girl from three days ago make Jian Chen experience defeat, but she had also made him realize how much strength he needed.After paying for the room, Jian Chen stayed there within the room for 10 days. In those 10 days, Jian Chen hadn\u2019t taken a single step out of his room and only used the monster cores in his possession to cultivate. Even for meals he had the inn waitress deliver it straight to his room.After the 10 days had passed, Jian Chen\u2019s strength had made huge improvements. Already reaching the Middle Great Saint tier, the Saint Force within himself was now much stronger than before. Even his Saint Weapon, the Light Wind Sword, had been upgraded and became even harder than before.With 10 days of cultivation, the Class 3 Monster Cores Jian Chen had were all but gone, leaving Jian Chen with two Class 4 Monster Cores.Getting off the bed, Jian Chen walked towards the window to look at the sky. Because he had spent so much time cultivating, he was no longer able to distinguish what time it was, and could only rely on the positioning of the sun to get an approximate time.Right outside, the sun was shining brightly without a cloud in the sky for miles. With the huge red flaming ball in the sky emitting strong heat rays, it signified the start of the afternoon.\u201cRight now, it should be time to deal with the Silver Striped Golden Snake, I really look forward to the Ten Thousand Immunity.\u201d Jian Chen said as he observed the mass of people outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
